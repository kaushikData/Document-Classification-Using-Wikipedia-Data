Books and films are commonly released under a different title when they are screened or sold in a different country. This can vary from small change to the title, such as the addition of \"The\", to wholesale changes. Film titles are also often changed when they are released on DVD or VHS.\n\nThe reasons for this are varied, but usually point towards marketable, linguistic or cultural differences. Some titles may not be easily understood in other parts of the world, and may even be considered offensive. Most title changes are commercial. An example is Italian Director's Sergio Leone's 1971 film initially released as \"Duck, You Sucker!\", as he was convinced this was a well-known English saying. When the film sold poorly, it was subsequently rebranded as \"A Fistful of Dynamite\", similar in name to his 1964 film \"A Fistful of Dollars\", part of the successful Dollars Trilogy.\n\nWhen Scholastic Corporation bought the U.S. rights to \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", they thought that a child would not want to read a book with the word \"philosopher\" in the title and, after some discussion, the American edition was published in September 1998 under the title Rowling suggested, \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\". Rowling claimed that she regretted this change and would have fought it if she had been in a stronger position at the time. Philip Nel has pointed out that the change lost the connection with alchemy.\n"}

{"id": "148593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148593", "title": "Contact juggling", "text": "Contact juggling\n\nContact juggling is a form of object manipulation that focuses on the movement of objects such as balls in contact with the body. Although often used in conjunction with \"toss juggling\", it differs in that it involves the rolling of one or more objects without releasing them into the air.\nMany of the techniques found in contact juggling, such as balancing or rolling a single ball or palm spinning (see \"Baoding Balls\"), have been performed for centuries. More variations were introduced by vaudevillians such as Paul Cinquevalli. In 1986, American juggler Tony Duncan was reported to be holding audiences spellbound with an act that involved rolling a single ball all over his body.\n\nMichael Moschen brought the form to a new level with his performance, \"Light\", developed in the 1980s. In this performance he used 75mm clear crystal balls, palm spinning up to eight balls simultaneously. He finished the act by rolling a single clear ball so that it appeared to float over his hands and arms. Moschen received praise from the international circus community for his range of innovative techniques, and he was made a MacArthur Fellow (received a \"Genius Award\") in 1990. In the 1986 film, \"Labyrinth\", David Bowie's character performs contact juggling throughout the film. These manipulations were performed by Moschen, who stood behind Bowie during filming, reaching around and performing the tricks \"blind\". In the film's credits, Moschen is credited for \"crystal ball manipulation.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1990, John P. Miller (now better known by his pen-name, James Ernest), wrote and published the first edition of the book \"Contact Juggling\", which covers all of the basic contact juggling techniques and methods for learning them. The first edition had a run of only 100 copies, photocopied and stapled. The second edition was published in 1991, in a comb-bound format, by Ernest Graphics Press, with the author listed as James Ernest. Ernest is credited with coining the term \"contact juggling\".\n\nIn 1991, the video \"Michael Moschen: In Motion\" (created as the television special \"In Motion with Michael Moschen\" for PBS's \"Great Performances\" series) was released. Since then, this form of juggling has received further popularization through instructional materials and performances developed by jugglers other than Moschen. Throughout the 1990s, there was continuing contention within the juggling community regarding whether Moschen's ideas were being stolen by performers and juggling instructors (see \"Controversy\", below). Many resources have since become available for contact jugglers, such as clubs, books, festivals, videos/DVDs, and balls specifically manufactured for contact juggling.\n\nIn 2010, Zoom TV, a direct-marketing company, began mass-marketing \"the Fushigi Magic Gravity Ball\", an acrylic contact juggling ball with a steel core (used to prevent the focusing of sunlight through a clear acrylic sphere, a fire hazard). Zoom TV claimed that the ball possesses special properties that make it \"appear to float\" and improve balance and control (see \"Controversy\", below), and saw significant commercial success.\n\nIn 2010, an updated and revised third edition of the book \"Contact Juggling\" was released by Ernest Graphics Press.\n\nBody rolling means manipulating one or more props (usually balls) around the hands, arms, and other parts of the body. Balance is required to hold the ball in various positions of control. This includes tricks such as headrolling and the butterfly, the trick of rolling the ball from the palm to the back of the hand via the fingertips.\n\nThe headroll is a trick involving rolling an object or prop, typically a ball, around on the juggler's head. The most commonly performed version is rolling a ball from temple to temple, across the forehead. At some points during the trick, the object may be balanced in place at a certain location on the head. Points where the prop may be balanced (also known as placement, or trap) include: the temple, the center of the forehead, the back of the neck, the eye socket, the mouth, and the most difficult; the top of the head.\n\nPalm spinning means manipulating one or more balls in the open hand so that at least one ball is in motion. Balls may be in both hands or transferred between hands to form graceful and fluid patterns, including rotating a pyramid made of four or five balls in one hand.\n\nIsolation refers to the manipulation of a ball so that it appears to be suspended in place. Similar to sleight-of-hand techniques in magic or fixed-point mime techniques; the performers exploit the clear surface of the ball to hide any noticeable rotation, creating the effect that the ball is still while the performer moves around the ball.\n\nSome jugglers have claimed that portions of the book \"Contact Juggling\" and any juggling performances that contain elements similar to Michael Moschen's original \"Light\" performance are breaches of Moschen's intellectual property or copyright. In 1992, Michael Moschen threatened not to attend the International Jugglers' Association annual conference in Quebec, Canada, where he was to be a guest of honor, due to a favorable review of the book \"Contact Juggling\" in the Fall 1991 issue of the IJA's periodical, \"Juggler's World\". In the end, Moschen did attend the festival. \nThe wide commercial success of the \"Fushigi Magic Gravity Ball\" in 2010 reignited the controversy within the contact juggling community. The television advertisement consisted of a montage of contact juggling performance, the amazed reactions of audience members, suggestions that the ball appeared to float by itself, and an announcer suggesting that the ball can be quickly mastered \"in just minutes.\" Concerned about the public depiction of contact juggling being accomplished not by skill but by means of a special prop, contact jugglers quickly filled a Fushigi thread to 100 pages on contactjuggling.org. The Winter 2010 edition of the IJA's periodical \"Juggle\" features a 4-page article about \"the Dynamic/Contact/Sphereplay/Fushigi Controversy\" by Brad Weston, including an interview with the president of Zoom TV Products, the marketing firm that produced the Fushigi ball. The following issue featured a rebuttal by a professional contact juggler accusing Zoom TV Products of exploiting contact juggling to sell a deceptively marketed product. The Fushigi ball is no longer in production.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "378422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=378422", "title": "Dirk Pitt", "text": "Dirk Pitt\n\nDirk Pitt is a fictional character, the protagonist of a series of bestselling adventure/thriller novels written by Clive Cussler.\n\nDirk Eric Pitt is a renowned adventurer. Cussler describes him as tall, 6 ft 3 in (190.5 cm) with craggy looks, dark wavy hair, and possessing a rangy build. His most striking feature is his opaline green eyes, which can be both alluring or intimidating, as need be. Pitt has a commanding presence which, combined with a quick, sly wit, often infuriates those opposed to him. His comical banter with his sidekick Al Giordino during stressful situations leaves the reader with little doubt that both are confident of their abilities. While Dirk may be considered the hero of the two, Al Giordino is the man behind him. The character is an avid collector of cars, a characteristic shared with his creator, Clive Cussler.\n\nDirk is the son of Senator George Pitt of California. Throughout his life, there have been three women of significance: Summer Moran, Maeve Fletcher, and Loren Smith.\nSummer is the mother of his twin children: a son, Dirk Pitt, Jr., and a daughter, Summer Pitt. She is often described as Pitt's first real love. The daughter of deranged scientist Frederick Moran, she was believed dead by Pitt when she was lost during an attempt to rescue her father as his underwater lair collapsed. As revealed by twenty-three-year-old Dirk Pitt Jr. when the two meet in the concluding chapters of the novel \"Valhalla Rising,\" Summer in fact survived, badly maimed by the incident, and refused to seek him out because she wanted Pitt to remember her as he knew her. She gave birth to the twins shortly thereafter and raised them, naming them after their parents.\n\nDirk met Maeve in \"Shock Wave\". Much like Summer, Maeve was the daughter of a deranged, ruthless individual, Arthur Dorsett, and also became a mother of two. However, unlike Summer, Maeve refused to have any part in her family's dealings or her father's plan, instead deciding to strike out on her own and having her two children out of wedlock. Maeve also ends up earning a master's degree in zoology and is serving as a tour guide aboard a cruise in the Antarctic when she and Pitt first meet. During the events of \"Shock Wave\", Maeve and Dirk pledge their deepest love for each other, but unfortunately Maeve is already fatally wounded, and dies in Pitt's arms.\n\nPitt has had a long-term relationship with Congresswoman Loren Smith, whom he eventually marries. He graduated from the United States Air Force Academy, and attained the rank of major (this was changed to the U.S. Naval Academy in the film versions of \"Raise the Titanic\" and \"Sahara\") with lifelong best friend, Al Giordino. In the novel \"Flood Tide,\" it is mentioned that he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In the novel \"Pacific Vortex!\" it is revealed that Pitt has been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with two clusters, a Silver Star, a Purple Heart and many other commendations. Dirk is an accomplished pilot who is qualified to fly both fixed-wing and rotary aircraft. His weapon of choice is a Colt .45-caliber M1911 semi-automatic pistol that he received from his father. His drink of choice is blue agave Tequila. Dirk believes that quality tequila should be drunk straight with salt and lime, preferring to use cheaper tequila in margaritas. He is described as wearing an orange-faced Doxa dive watch.\n\nDirk Pitt received a commendation for shooting down Admiral Sandecker's plane during the Vietnam War. The plane was carrying the Admiral and his staff to a remote base north of Da Nang. Unknown to them, the base was overrun by the North Vietnamese and their radio was malfunctioning, so they were unable to receive a warning. Pitt was flying nearby returning to his base from a bombing mission and was ordered to intercept and alert the admiral by whatever means available. When efforts to communicate with the Admiral's plane were unsuccessful, Pitt expertly shot out both engines on the transport, forcing them to ditch in the sea instead of landing at the captured base. Dirk then flew cover, strafing any boats that left the shore, until everyone was taken aboard a navy patrol vessel.\n\nPitt is actually named after Dirk Cussler, son of the author, who incidentally is also co-writer of the newest Pitt adventures with his father.\n\nWhen Dirk Pitt is not traveling, which he is doing most of the time, he lives in his unique home - a remodeled and refurbished hangar on the grounds of Washington National Airport, near Washington, D.C.. A cast-iron stairway leads into a cluttered apartment with maps of the sea and models of ships scattered all about. The hangar houses his classic and antique car collection, as well as a Messerschmitt Me 262 aircraft, a Ford trimotor aircraft, a Pullman railroad dining car, and a totem pole. The hangar also contains items collected from prior adventures, such as a cast-iron bathtub with an outboard motor fixed to one end, and is protected by a state-of-the-art security system. Pitt occasionally adds classic cars to his collection purloined from a variety of antagonists over the course of his adventures.\n\nIn the course of his work as a marine engineer of the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), an oceanographic research organization headed by Admiral James Sandecker with Rudi Gunn as second in command, Dirk Pitt has made numerous important shipwreck discoveries, and he has also thwarted a large number of plans by villains intent on global catastrophe or world domination.<br>\nDirk Pitt went on, in the more recent novels, to become the head of NUMA when Admiral James Sandecker was appointed as Vice President of the United States by President Ward after the Vice President unexpectedly died in office. Despite this appointment, Pitt is uncomfortable with his desk job, and still personally heads projects in the field, becoming entangled in villainous plots just as easily as before his promotion.\n\n\nDirk Pitt adventure novels\n\nAlthough \"Pacific Vortex!\" was released in 1983, it is actually the first Dirk Pitt novel chronologically. The events of \"Pacific Vortex!\" happen before those of \"The Mediterranean Caper.\" In fact, several events in \"Pacific Vortex!\" are referred to in \"The Mediterranean Caper.\" The series does not have to be read in order, since each book stands by itself.\n\nThere is also a Dirk Pitt reference book:\n\n\nPitt has twice appeared on the big screen, in movie adaptations of \"Raise the Titanic!\" in 1980, and \"Sahara\" in 2005. In the former he was portrayed by Richard Jordan, and in the latter by Matthew McConaughey.\n\nOn 10 March 2009, Judge John P. Shook ordered Clive Cussler to pay $13.9 million in legal fees to the production company that turned his novel \"Sahara\" into a motion picture. In his ruling, Judge Shook agreed with lawyers for Crusader Entertainment that an original contract between the two parties called for an award of legal fees if either side breached. \"The issue boils down to whether the fees requested are reasonable and necessary,\" Shook said. He concluded that they were. Cussler sued Crusader in 2004, claiming the company reneged on a contract that gave him approval rights over the film's screenplay, when, in fact, he only had those rights until a director was hired. Crusader, which is owned by billionaire Philip Anschutz, countersued, accusing Cussler of duping it into adapting his book into a film based on an inflated number of novels sold. Jurors ruled in May 2007 in favor of the production company. On July 27, 2009, Cussler issued a final check to Crusader which totals the payback to $20 million to the wronged production company. A March 2010 decision by the California Court of Appeal has since overturned the earlier awardings of both the $5 million in damages and nearly $14 million in legal fees to Crusader.\n\n"}

The show averaged around a 20 percent audience share, pulling in around 2–3 million viewers each week, making it the most popular entertainment show on the channel. Channel 4's slot average for Eurotrash's broadcast time is around 900,000 viewers, making the show an important hit for the channel at the time.\n\nIt ran for 16 series (over 160 episodes) until 2007, making it one of the UK's longest running late-night entertainment shows. Channel 4 infrequently re-runs the series and repeats can be found on the Comedy Central Extra, Real Lives and on 3e in Ireland. Series 1 is also now available on All 4. After more than 10 years of broadcast, the show built up a substantial following and \"Eurotrash\" has around 15 million fans, and various fan sites.\n\nAll intellectual property rights to the series are now controlled by the production company, Rapido Television.\n\nA one-off special aired on 17 June 2016 to coincide with the UK's referendum on European Union membership.\n\nThe show was conceived in Paris for London-based Rapido Television by producer and director Peter Stuart. Rapido Television makes over 100 programme titles, mostly for Channel 4, and was originally launched with backing by Richard Branson. The first \"Eurotrash\" series were presented by Antoine de Caunes and Jean-Paul Gaultier, with narrative voiceovers by British comic actress Maria McErlane. Gaultier left at the end of series 7 and de Caunes then co-presented with a range of guest presenters for the remainder of the run.\n\nA number of features and stars survived from series one, including Pipi and Popo, two cardboard giraffes made from toilet paper tubes, and the Belgian singer Eddy Wally. Victoria Silvstedt was a semi-regular during 2003, often appearing in the studio with de Caunes to present the \"Naked Germans of the Week\" feature. Graham Norton featured as a roving reporter in series 9, Carla Bruni also appeared. Melinda Messenger appeared in the last series as a \"roving reporter\", always wearing a Union Jack minidress and big red boots.\n\nIn 2009, digital channel Living TV began airing a series of new compilation episodes under the title \"Eurotrash: The Sexy Bits\". These included new voiceovers from original narrator Maria McErlane.\n\nDespite being a big budget show (around £400,000 per hour to make) the programme was surreal and had a deliberate low budget feel. Bright colourful pop-art studio backgrounds used to be built full size, but in later years chromakey was used with model shots, adding to the comical 'trashy' feel. Studio material was shot in Paris. Topics covered included rabbit-showjumping, singing dogs, 'nude cleaning services', magicians, porn stars (such as the late Lolo Ferrari) and Europe's very worst (but usually popular in their host country) bands and singers.\n\nThe series was voiced by Maria McErlane. Davina McCall provided English voice translations in series 1. In later years Kate Robbins provided voiceovers for the strange continental \"stars\", which she performed in Yorkshire and other British regional accents and similar quirky anglicised effects. Johnny Daukes, former singer and writer with the indie Band FIN in the 1990s, provided male voices in a similar fashion throughout the series.\n\nOne issue had an obituary of Lolo Ferrari which was produced and broadcast with a straight voiceover as a mark of respect, which stood out from the usual comic tone of the programme.\n\n"}

The format was originally developed by JVC and supported by Sony, Canon, and Sharp. The four companies formed the HDV consortium in September 2003.\n\nConceived as an affordable high definition format for digital camcorders, HDV quickly caught on with many amateur and professional videographers due to its low cost, portability, and image quality acceptable for many professional productions.\n\nHDV and HDV logo are trademarks of JVC and Sony.\n\nHDV video and audio are encoded in digital form, using lossy interframe compression. Video is encoded with the H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 compression scheme, using 8-bit chroma and luma samples with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling. Stereo audio is encoded with the MPEG-1 Layer 2 compression scheme. The compressed audio and video are multiplexed into an MPEG-2 transport stream, which is typically recorded onto magnetic tape, but can also be stored in a computer file.\n\nThe data rate for both the audio and video is constant and is roughly the same as DV data rate. The relatively low video data rate can cause \"bit rate starvation\" in scenes that have lots of fine detail, rapid movement or other complex activity like flashing lights, and may result in visible artifacts, such as blockiness and blurring. In contrast to the video, HDV audio bitrate is relatively generous. At the coded bitrate of 384 kbit/s, MPEG-1 Layer 2 audio is regarded as \"perceptually lossless\".\n\nTwo major versions of HDV are \"HDV 720p\" and \"HDV 1080i\". The former is used by JVC and is informally known as \"HDV1\". The latter is preferred by Sony and Canon and is sometimes referred to as \"HDV2\". The \"HDV 1080i\" defines optional progressive recording modes, and in recent publications is sometimes called \"HDV 1080\" or \"1080-line HDV\" as progressive 1080-line recording becomes commonplace.\n\nHDV 720p format allows recording high definition video (HDV-HD) as well as progressive-scan standard definition video (HDV-SD).\n\nHDV-HD closely matches broadcast 720p progressive scan video standard in terms of scanning type, frame size, aspect ratio and data rate. Earlier HDV 720p camcorders could shoot only at 24, 25 and 30 frames per second. Later models offer both film-like (24p, 25p, 30p) and reality-like (50p, 60p) frame rates.\n\nHDV-SD is a mode for recording progressive-scan standard definition video. Such a video is sometimes called \"enhanced definition video\" (EDTV), but is considered high definition video in Australia. Depending on region, HDV-SD video is recorded either as 576p50 or as 480p60. Like DVCPRO Progressive, HDV-SD was meant as an intermediate format during the transition time from standard definition to high definition video. Later models of HDV 720p camcorders do not record in this mode.\n\nJVC was the only manufacturer of HDV 720p camcorders. JVC was the first to release an HDV camcorder, the handheld GR-HD1. Later JVC shifted its HDV development to shoulder-mounted cameras.\n\nA common misconception is that JVC developed a proprietary extension to HDV called ProHD, featuring film-like 24-frame/s progressive recording mode and LPCM audio, for professional use. JVC has clarified that ProHD is not a video recording format, but \"an approach for delivering affordable HD products\" and a common name for \"bandwidth efficient professional HD models\".\n\nSony adapted HDV, originally conceived as progressive-scan format by JVC, to interlaced video. Interlaced video has been a useful compromise for decades due to its ability to display motion smoothly while reducing recording and transmission bandwidth. Interlaced video is still being used in acquisition and broadcast, but interlaced display devices are being phased out. Modern flat-panel television sets that utilize plasma and LCD technology are inherently progressive. All modern computer monitors use progressive scanning as well. \n\nBefore interlaced video is displayed on a progressive-scan device it must be converted to progressive using the process known as deinterlacing. Progressive-scan television sets employ built-in deinterlacing circuits to cope with interlaced broadcast signal, but computer video players rarely have this capability. As such, interlaced video may exhibit ghosting or combing artifacts when watched on a computer.\n\nSome HDV 1080i camcorders are capable of recording progressive video within an interlaced stream, provided that the frame rate does not exceed half of the field rate. The first HDV 1080i camcorder to implement such \"Progressive Scanning\" was the Sony HVR-V1. To preserve compatibility with interlaced equipment the HVR-V1 records and outputs video in interlaced form. 25-frame/s and 30-frame/s progressive video is recorded on tape using progressive segmented frame (PsF) technique, while 24-frame/s recording employs . The camcorder offers two variations of 24-frame/s recording: \"24\" and \"24A\". In \"24\" mode the camera ensures that there are no cadence breaks for a whole tape, this mode works better for watching video directly from the camera and for adding \"film look\" to interlaced video. In the \"24A\" mode the camera starts every clip on an A frame with timecode set to an even second margin and records the 2-3 pull-down identification data in the HDV stream, so that compatible NLE software knows when to remove the 2-3 pull-down cadences. Several editing tools, including Sony's own Vegas, are capable of processing 24A video as proper 24 frame/s progressive video.\n\nPrior to the HVR-V1, Sony was offering \"Cineframe\", essentially an interlaced-to-progressive converter, to simulate film-like motion. The conversion process involved blending and discarding fields, so vertical resolution of the resulting video suffered. Motion, produced in the 24-frame/s variant of Cineframe was too uneven for professional use. The same or better film look effect can be achieved by converting regular interlaced video into progressive format using computer software.\n\nIn 2007 Canon commoditized progressive scanning, releasing the HV20 camcorder. The version for 50 Hz market featured PF25 mode with PsF-like recording, while the version for 60 Hz market had PF24 mode, which utilized 2-3 pulldown scheme. Progressive scan video recorded with the HV20 does not include flags necessary for performing automated film-mode deinterlacing, which is why most editing tools treat such video as interlaced. The HV30, released in 2008, implemented additional PsF-like PF30 mode for 60 Hz markets. Output is performed via component, HDMI and FireWire in interlaced form.\n\nProgressive scan video must be properly deinterlaced to achieve full vertical resolution and to avoid interlace artifacts. 25P and 30P video must be deinterlaced with \"weave\" or \"no deinterlacing\" algorithm, which means joining two fields of each frame together into one progressive frame. This operation can be done in most editing tools simply by changing project properties from interlaced to progressive. 24P video must go through \"film-mode deinterlacing\" also known as inverse telecine, which throws out judder frames and restores original 24-frame/s progressive video. Many editing tools cannot perform film-mode deinterlacing, requiring usage of a separate converter.\n\nThe original 1080-line HDV specification defined interlaced recording only, which is suitable for television broadcast. As users have become increasingly interested in digital cinematography and in web videos, progressive recording became a necessity. In response to this need, capability for native progressive recording has been added to the 1080i HDV specification. Progressive recording modes are optional for 1080i HDV devices, which means that not every HDV 1080i camcorder or deck is capable of recording or playing back native progressive video. Because HDV 1080i specification now includes both interlaced and progressive recording modes, in recent publications it is often called \"HDV 1080\" or \"1080-line HDV\", but the official name still bears the \"i\" suffix.\n\nHDV camcorders capable of native 1080-line progressive video record it at rates of 23.98 frame/s (commonly referred to as \"24p\") and 29.97 frame/s (\"30p\") for 60 Hz markets, and at 25 frame/s (\"25p\") for 50 Hz markets. Video is output as true progressive video via an i.LINK/Firewire port. Output through other ports is performed in interlaced mode to preserve compatibility with existing interlaced equipment.\n\nThe first 1080-line HDV camcorder to offer recording in native progressive format was the Canon XL H1, introduced in 2006. It was followed by the XH-G1 and XH-A1. When shooting in progressive mode, also known as \"Frame mode\", these camcorders generate progressive video from interlaced CCD sensors. Because of row-pair summation, vertical resolution of progressive video is 10%-25% lower than resolution of interlaced video.\n\nIn 2008 Sony released its own models capable of native progressive recording: the HVR-S270, the HVR-Z7 and the HVR-Z5. Sony stressed out that the models handle the signal entirely in progressive mode all the way from capture to encoding to recording on tape to output. Sony has designed \"Native Progressive Recording\" logo for the devices that are capable of native progressive recording and playback.\n\nIn 2009 Canon released the HV40 HDV camcorder. Its 60 Hz variant, carrying prominent \"24p native progressive\" mark, became the first consumer HDV model to offer 24-frame/s native progressive recording. Like the aforementioned Sony models, the HV40 uses true progressive-scan sensor.\n\nDespite differences in branding, native progressive modes offered by Canon and Sony are fully compatible, with both companies adhering to HDV specifications for recording native 1080p video. Other HDV devices capable of reading and recording in native progressive 1080-line format include the Sony HVR-M15AU, HVR-25AU, HVR-M15AE, HVR-25AE and HVR-M35 HDV videocassette recorders, and the 60 Hz Canon HV20/HV30 camcorders when used in tape recorder mode.\n\nGenerally, HDV devices are capable of playing and recording in DV format, though this is not required by HDV specification. Many HDV devices manufactured by Sony are capable of playing and recording in DVCAM format. 1080-line devices generally are not compatible with 720-line devices, though some standalone tape decks accept both HDV flavors. Devices that can play and record native 1080p video can play and record native 1080i video, however the opposite is not always the case.\n\nHDV camcorders are usually offered with either 50 Hz or 60 Hz scanning rate depending on a region. Some models, like Canon XH-A1/G1 and third-generation Sony models such as HVR-S270, HVR-Z5 and HVR-Z7, can be made switchable for \"world\" capability. Some JVC ProHD products like the GY-HD200UB and GY-HD250U are world-capable out of the box.\n\nHDV is closely related to XDCAM and to TOD families of recording formats, which use the same video encoding — MPEG-2. In particular, HDV 720p is equivalent to 19 Mbit/s XDCAM EX recording mode used in tapeless JVC ProHD camcorders, while HDV 1080i is equivalent to 25 Mbit/s XDCAM HD recording mode and to \"1440CBR\" TOD recording mode.\n\nThe HDV consortium allows using the HDV trademarks only for products that incorporate a tape drive that can record and play video cassette compliant to the HDV format. Therefore, HDV remains a tape-based format. Various solutions for tapeless recording of HDV video that are available on the market are not covered by HDV specification.\n\nMost HDV camcorders use \"small\" DV cassettes also known as MiniDV cassettes. The Sony HVR-S270 shoulder-mount camcorder is capable of recording both onto \"small\" and \"large\" cassettes. Because HDV has the same data rate as DV, recording time is the same as DV Standard Play. Unlike DV, HDV does not offer Long Play speed.\n\nA standard MiniDV cassette provides one hour of recording. By using cassettes with longer and thinner tape it is possible to record up to 80 minutes onto one MiniDV cassette, though usage of such tape is not recommended. Large DV cassette loaded with longer tape can deliver up to 4.5 hours of recording time.\n\nTape manufacturers also offer MiniDV cassettes specifically for HDV recording. Such cassettes have the same Metal Evaporate (ME) formulation as normal DV cassettes, but are claimed to have reduced drop-out rate compared to standard DV cassettes. Usage of such cassettes is not required by HDV specification.\n\nSince HDV was introduced, \"tapeless\" — or \"file-based\" — video recording formats such as DVCPRO P2, XDCAM and AVCHD have gained broad acceptance. The trend towards tapeless workflow was accelerated with increased capacity and reduced cost of non-linear media like hard disk drives (HDD), optical discs and solid-state memory.\n\nRecognizing the need for faster workflow, JVC, Sony and other manufacturers offer on-camera recording units, which convert an HDV camcorder into a hybrid system capable of recording both onto tape and onto file-based media. These recorders connect to a camcorder via Firewire and do not recompress HDV video, offering exactly the same image quality as if video were recorded on tape.\n\nJVC offers two FireStore recorders made by Focus Enhancements: the HDD-based DR-HD100 and MR-HD100 on-camera recorders; it also offers the SxS-based KA-MR100G recorder. Canon offers Focus Enhancements FS-CF and FS-CF Pro models, which record onto CompactFlash memory cards. Sony offers the HDD-based HVR-DR60 and the CompactFlash-based HVR-MRC1K recorders.\n\nRecording time depends on capacity of media used. In particular, a 32 GB CompactFlash card is good for 144 minutes of HDV video. The HVR-DR60 can fit over two hours of high definition video, while the FireStore models with 100 GB disk drive can store almost four hours of footage. File-based recorders are invaluable for continuous recording that extends one hour.\n\nHDV is accepted for broadcast TV use with varying restrictions.\n\nDiscovery Channel chose HDV handhelds for shooting \"Deadliest Catch\" despite their reduced light sensitivity and a large depth of focus, because smaller cameras were better for crew safety and they destroy several dozen cameras per series. HDV camcorders were also used for shooting \"MythBusters\". \n\nIn February 2009 ITV News bought 68 Sony HVR-Z5E handheld camcorders for its multi-skilling journalists. The camcorders, which come with non-removable 20x lens and outfitted with CompactFlash recorders became popular among journalists who are not trained camera operators.\n\nIn the TV series \"JAG\" made for CBS, handheld HDV camcorders were used for scenes where larger HD cameras would have been impractical. \n\nThe BBC does not consider HDV to meet HD broadcast standards, therefore acceptability of HDV footage for HD programming is limited to 25% of the program's total duration.\n\nThe Discovery HD Theater accepts content sourced from 1080-line HDV camcorders, but limits it to 15% of a whole program. Producers wishing to use HDV are required to submit an approved postproduction path outlining their handling of the footage in the editing process. The Discovery Channel HD simulcast has fewer or no guidelines and accepts a mix of XDCAM HD, HDV and AVCHD for the length of a program. For example, Discovery Channel aired \"911: The Bronx\", a six-episode reality series set in a hospital and shot with HDV cameras. Several episodes of \"Survivorman\" were shot with the Sony HVR-Z1U and HDR-HC3 camcorders. \n\nThe Discovery Channel International uses rating system that defines Gold, Silver and Bronze acquisition and delivery levels. Depending on particular camera make and model and on post-production process, HDV footage can be rated as Silver HD, Bronze HD, or widescreen SD. In particular, some users consider Canon HDV camcorders to deliver the best-looking image with the least amount of compression artifacts among the models having 25 Mbit/s MPEG-2 HD codec.\n\nThe PBS accepts HDV for widescreen programming acquisition and to a limited extent for use in HD programs. PBS may allow usage of \"less than full broadcast quality equipment\" if compression artifacts are \"not obvious when viewed on an HDTV monitor\". For example, the Art Wolfe's TV series \"Travels to the Edge\" was produced for PBS in HDV format using Canon XL-H1 camcorders.\n\nThe Travel Channel HD eagerly accepts HDV footage. For example, Sony HDV camcorders were used for production of highly acclaimed Anthony Bourdain's \"\" program, among other cameras. \"Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern\" and its follow-up \"Bizarre World\" are shot with Sony HDV cameras as well. \"Madventures\" was shot with the Sony EX1 XDCAM EX camera paired with the Sony HVR-A1U HDV camcorder.\n\nCurrent TV used Sony HDV camcorders to shoot episodes for Vanguard TV series.\n\n\"Guiding Light\", the longest-running soap opera in production in television and radio history, broke away from traditional three-sided sets and pedestal-style cameras in 2008, choosing the handheld Canon XH-G1 for shooting on practical locations.\n\nBecause HDV video is recorded in digital form, original content can be copied onto another tape or \"captured\" to a computer for editing without quality degradation. Depending on capturing software and computer's file system, either a whole tape is captured into one contiguous file, or the video is split in smaller 4 GB or 2 GB segments, or a separate file is created for each take. The way files are named depends on capturing software. Some systems convert HDV video into proprietary \"intermediate\" format on the fly while capturing, so original format is not preserved.\n\nHDV footage can be natively edited by most non-linear editors, with real-time playback being possible on modern mainstream personal computers. Slower computers may exhibit reduced performance compared to other formats such as DV because of high resolution and interframe compression of HDV video.\n\nEditing performance can be improved by converting HDV to intermediate format prior to editing. These include various Cineform products, Edius HQ, Avid DNxHD, Apple Intermediate Codec and Apple ProRes 422, among others. Usage of an intermediate codec adds one more \"generation\" to the video, potentially degrading its quality. On another hand, an intermediate codec can reduce blockiness and fix other issues in the original video, like interlaced chroma in progressive recordings. \n\nDepending on the non-linear editing system (NLE), it is possible to minimize generation losses by editing native HDV video using straight cuts only, with no effects, and rendering back to HDV. Up to 15 frames per each cut may be re-encoded because of the long-GOP nature of HDV video.\n\nHDV video can be recorded or \"printed\" back to tape. Such tapes are often accepted by local television stations, though many organizations prefer the submissions to be delivered in higher-end format like Digital Betacam, HDCAM or D5 HD. It is also possible to record M2TS file to any media that offers enough capacity, like a DVD, external HDD drive or a memory card.\n\nFor consumer use, HDV-sourced video can be delivered on a Blu-ray Disc without re-encoding, can be converted to AVCHD and delivered on an AVCHD disc, or can be downconverted to DVD-Video.\n\nCanon entered the HDV market in September 2005, with the Canon XL H1, a professional-oriented modular camera system with interchangeable lenses, HD-SDI output, and three 1440 × 1080 ⅓\" CCDs. This was the first HDV camcorder to allow 1080-line native progressive recording.\nIn July 2006, Canon announced the handheld XH A1/XH G1 models, which use the same sensor as the XL-H1. Both models share the same body and most of the features, with the XH G1 geared towards professional multi-camera production and including connections for HD-SDI/SD-SDI Out, genlock, and time code. \n\nLater in the same year, Canon introduced the consumer-oriented Canon HV10, a compact unit with a single 2.76 megapixel CMOS sensor. The camera recorded interlaced video only.\n\nIn April 2007 Canon released the HV20 which used the same sensor and internal processor as the HV10, had a larger lens and more conventional layout. This was the first consumer HDV camcorder that featured progressive shooting modes in addition to native interlaced recording. Progressive-scan video was recorded within interlaced container to remain compatible with consumer level editing suites. The version for 50 Hz market offered PF25 mode, which utilized Progressive segmented Frame technique, while the 60 Hz variant featured PF24 mode, which utilized 2-3 pulldown scheme. \n\nThe HV30, released in 2008, was a minor update of the HV20. The body color has been changed from silver to black, the LCD screen has been improved, and the 60 Hz variant implemented PsF-like PF30 mode.\n\nIn 2009 Canon released the HV40. Its 50 Hz variant was practically identical to the HV30, while the 60 Hz variant became the first consumer HDV camcorder capable of native progressive 24 frames/s recording.\n\nIn 2003 JVC released the first HDV camcorder — the handheld GR-HD1. The camcorder offered standard DV recording mode, HDV 720p30 and HDV 480p60. The HDV modes used the older Rec. 601 standard for color space, rather than the newer Rec. 709 standard intended for high-definition video. The imager of the GR-HD1 used a single 1/3\" CCD sensor instead of a 3CCD setup, another unusual choice discouraging professional use.The GR-HD1 was not popular in either the consumer or semi-professional market, and JVC later shifted its HDV development to professional shoulder-mounted cameras.\n\nThe shoulder mount GY-HD100 camcorder was released in 2005 and featured 3CCD imaging system with native 720p resolution, interchangeable lens and 24 frame/s recording. Because of the latter feature this camcorder became popular for shooting \"digital movies\". The updated version, GY-HD110, provides several updates and fixed split-screen effect found on some GY-HD100 cameras.\n\nThe GY-HD200, released later, offered 50p/60p recording, 720p-to-1080i converter and Anton Bauer professional battery with mount.\n\nIn 2006 JVC released the GY-HD250, which simplified multi-camera recording by providing genlock and time code input/output. HD/SD-SDI output allowed to record uncompressed video.\n\nIn 2008 the \"B\" modification of the GY-HD200 was released, allowing live recording of either 720p or 1080i signal onto an external tapeless recorder. Recording to tape was still performed in 720p mode only.\n\nSharp is the only member of the HDV Consortium that has not produced an HDV camcorder or a videocassette recorder. The closest Sharp has ever got in supporting HDV standard is the AQUOS DV-ACV52 digital video player. The player supports HDV video, though it does not have a tape transport. Instead, it allows playback and dubbing of DV/HDV video from a camcorder connected to the player via a FireWire connector.\n\nSony specializes in 1080i HDV equipment and makes products for both 60 Hz and 50 Hz markets. Traditionally, Sony uses suffixes \"E\" and \"P\" to identify 50 Hz models, and suffix \"U\" or no suffix at all to identify 60 Hz models. Models listed below are specified without suffixes.\n\nIn September 2004 Sony released the first HDV 1080i camcorder, the HDR-FX1. Its professional version, the HVR-Z1, came with XLR audio inputs and 44 additional features. Most notably, the HVR-Z1 was switchable between 50 Hz and 60 Hz scanning to cater for the different scanning rates used in different markets.\n\nIn the middle of 2005 Sony released its first consumer HDV model, the HDR-HC1, which had a single CMOS sensor, electronic stabilization system and was capable of recording in DV and HDV 1080i modes. Its professional version, the HVR-A1, added a second accessory shoe in place of the flash, XLR audio inputs, additional recording options, larger eyecup and larger lens hood. \n\nIn 2006 Sony replaced the HDR-HC1 with the smaller and cheaper HDR-HC3, which featured an incrementally improved CMOS chip, but omitted some features of its predecessor. The HDR-HC3 was replaced by the HDR-HC5 which used the same CMOS chip as the HDR-HC3, and added an option of recording in xvYCC color space. The replacement model, the HDR-HC7 came with a higher pixel count CMOS sensor and with a microphone input. Like the HDR-HC5, the HDR-HC7 could also record xvYCC. In 2008 the HDR-HC7 was replaced with the HDR-HC9.\n\nIn 2006, Sony added two new models to its upscale HDV lineup: the \"advanced amateur\" HDR-FX7 and its professional cousin, the HVR-V1. The progressive-scan CMOS sensors of these models resolve full 1080 lines of vertical resolution. The HDR-FX7 records interlaced video only, while the HVR-V1 offers the choice of shooting interlaced or progressive video. Progressive video is converted to interlaced using pulldown for recording onto tape.\n\nIn August 2007, Sony introduced the shoulder-mounted version of the HDR-HC7, the HVR-HD1000.\n\nIn November 2007, Sony announced the HVR-Z7 handheld camcorder and the HVR-S270 shoulder-mounted camera. Both use the same three 1/3\" ClearVid CMOS sensors and attain light sensitivity similar to that of the venerable DSR-PD170 while offering HDV recording in native interlaced, progressive scan and native progressive modes. The Z7 has 2 XLR audio inputs and HDMI output while the S270 has 4 XLR inputs and features HD-SDI output. Presently the HVR-S270 is the only HDV camcorder capable of recording onto full-size DV cassettes.\n\nIn 2008 the HDR-FX1 and the HVR-Z1 were replaced with the HDR-FX1000 and the HVR-Z5, respectively. The major changes include utilizing CMOS sensors instead of CCD, and progressive mode shooting. The FX1000 records progressive scan video using pulldown, while HVR-Z5 offers native progressive recording.\n\nIn November 2008 Sony restarted production of the HDR-FX7 camcorder, which had been discontinued a year earlier. Offered for almost half the original price, the HDR-FX7 bridged the gap between the HDR-HC9 and the FX1000.\n\nIn summer 2009 Sony discontinued the HDR-HC9 on the North American market, but restarted its sales in spring 2010, this time advertising it not as an HDV camcorder, but as a MiniDV HD camcorder. MiniDV HD has never been officially presented as an alternative name for HDV. The other competing HD recording standard that uses DV cassettes is DVCPROHD. In spring 2011 the HDR-HC9 is no longer available for purchase from the Sony's North American online store.\n\nJVC released its latest HDV camcorder — the GY-HD250 — in 2006. In September 2011 this model was discontinued on the U.S. market. The \"B\" modification of the older GY-HD200 was released in 2008 and discontinued in November 2009. The latest HDV camcorder made by Canon — the HV40 — was released in 2009, but it traces back to the HV20 developed in 2007, and was phased out of production during 2011, though stocks have lasted through 2012. The latest Sony consumer HDV model is the HDR-HC9, originally released in 2008 and discontinued on the North American market in 2011. 2008 was also the year when Sony presented the latest \"advanced amateur\" and professional HDV camcorders, namely the HDR-FX1000 and the HVR-Z5.\n\nAll the three major manufacturers of HDV equipment — JVC, Canon and Sony — have heavily invested in development of MPEG-2 video compression scheme and continue to rely on it in their professional tapeless camcorder lineups: XDCAM HD (Sony), XDCAM EX (Sony and JVC), XDCAM HD422 (Sony), XF Codec (Canon). At the same time Sony and Canon have joined Panasonic in marketing of AVCHD recording format, which is claimed to deliver visual quality similar to HDV at half the datarate. Consumer high definition camcorders released by these companies since 2009 employ AVCHD format.\n\nIn 2010 industry analysts did not expect new HDV products, but believed that manufacturers would continue to support HDV for their existing users, while at the same time transitioning to file-based workflow.\n\nWhen accessed in 2017, the Broadcast & Production Cameras section on Sony's website does not mention HDV technology. The HDV page does not list any equipment or whitepapers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30873392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30873392", "title": "Heidi Game", "text": "Heidi Game\n\nThe Heidi\" Game or Heidi\" Bowl was an American Football League (AFL) game played on November 17, 1968, between the Oakland Raiders and the visiting New York Jets. The game was notable for its exciting finish, in which Oakland scored two touchdowns in the final minute to win the game 43–32, but got its name for a decision by the game's television broadcaster, NBC, to break away from its coverage of the game on the East Coast to broadcast the television film \"Heidi\", causing many viewers to miss the Raiders' comeback.\n\nIn the late 1960s, few professional football games took longer than two and a half hours to play, and the Jets–Raiders' three-hour time slot was thought to be adequate. A high-scoring contest, together with a number of injuries and penalties for the two bitter AFL rivals, caused the game to run long. NBC executives had originally ordered that \"Heidi\" begin at 7:00 p.m. ET, but decided to allow the game to air to its conclusion. However, as 7 p.m. approached, NBC's switchboards were jammed by viewers phoning to inquire about the night's schedule, preventing the planned change from being communicated. \"Heidi\" began as scheduled, preempting the final moments of the game and the two Oakland touchdowns in the eastern half of the country, to the outrage of viewers.\n\nResponse to the pre-emption by viewers and other critics was negative; the family members of several Jets players were unaware of the game's actual conclusion, while NBC received further criticism for its poor timing in displaying the final score of the game during the \"Heidi\" movie. NBC's president Julian Goodman formally apologized for the incident. The Jets and Raiders met again in the AFL Championship Game, with the Jets winning 27–23. They later defeated the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III.\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, NBC installed special \"\"Heidi\" phones\", with a connection to a different telephone exchange from other network phones, to ensure that network personnel could communicate under similar circumstances. The game also had an influence on sports broadcasting practices; the future National Football League would contractually stipulate that all game telecasts be shown to their conclusion in the markets of the visiting team, while other major leagues and events adopted similar mandates. In 1997, the \"Heidi\" Game was voted the most memorable regular season game in pro football history.\n\nThe Jets and Raiders were founding members of the American Football League; both teams began to play in 1960, the Jets under the name Titans of New York. The two teams had little success in their early years, playing so poorly that both the Titans and Raiders were allowed to draft players from other AFL teams following the 1962 season. In 1967, the Jets, under the guidance of coach Weeb Ewbank and quarterback Joe Namath, posted their first winning record at 7–5–2. Oakland, on the other hand, won the Western Division in 1967 with a 13–1 mark under coach John Rauch and then the AFL Championship Game over the Houston Oilers, 40–7, before falling to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl II. Both teams were seen as likely contenders for the 1968 AFL Championship.\n\nThe two teams did not play in the same division. However, each AFL team played all other teams in the league each year, allowing the Raiders and Jets to forge a bitter rivalry. In 1963, Oakland general manager (later owner) Al Davis traded guard Dan Ficca to New York during training camp, without mentioning to Ewbank (who was also the Jets' general manager) that Ficca would not be released from his military service for another six weeks. In 1966, with less than a minute to go and the Raiders leading at the new Oakland Coliseum, 28–20, Jets left tackle Winston Hill predicted to Namath in the huddle that the man he was blocking, Ben Davidson, would rush on the next play, leaving the Raiders exposed to a draw play. Namath called the draw, and handed the ball off to running back Emerson Boozer for 47 yards and a touchdown. After a Jets two-point conversion, the game ended in a 28–28 tie, and an embittered Davidson stated, \"I'll get even. They still have to play us next year.\" They did, twice. In Week 4, the Jets defeated the Raiders at Shea Stadium, 27–14; this was the Raiders' only regular season loss. In Week 14, each team's 13th game, the teams met again, in Oakland. Sportswriter Paul Zimmerman said of the second 1967 Jets-Raiders game:\n\nDavidson stated about his play in the Oakland victory, \"I don't think my tackle broke Namath's cheekbone. Not that I care ... Namath says that he's been beat up worse by girls. He's asking for it again.\" The Jets loss to the Raiders in 1967 knocked New York out of a tie for first place in their division – the AFL East was won by the Houston Oilers.\n\nIn the 1968 season, the Jets, Raiders, San Diego Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs established themselves as the leading teams. Going into Week 11 of the AFL season, each team had lost only two games; the Chiefs, who had not yet had a bye week, had eight wins, the others seven. In an era with no wild card teams, the Raiders needed a victory over the Jets in Week 11 to avoid falling a game and a half behind the Chiefs in the AFL West – finishing second, however good their record, would end their season. The Jets, on the other hand, would clinch at least a tie for the AFL East title with a victory over the Raiders in their only regular season meeting. Depending on the results of other games, the Jets could win the division if they beat the Raiders, gaining the right to host the AFL Championship Game, the winner of which would play the NFL champion in the Super Bowl. The ill-feeling of previous years was resurrected by an immense blown-up photograph, posted at Raider headquarters, of Davidson smashing Namath in the head. The photographed play was said to have broken the quarterback's jaw (though Namath stated he had broken it on a tough piece of steak, and some claim it was Raiders defensive end Ike Lassiter who injured Namath). Although the poster, which had been placed by Davis, was removed before the game, word of this \"intimidation through photography\" reached the Jets in New York.\n\nNamath, interviewed by reporters, stated that he liked the Raiders the least of any AFL team. In 2000, \"New York Times\" sportswriter Dave Anderson wrote of the Jets' preparations for the Oakland game:\n\nThe Raiders declined to allow New York reporters to watch practices, a courtesy Ewbank extended to Oakland pressmen. Raiders assistant coach (later head coach) John Madden was responsible for the exchange of game films with upcoming opponents; he sent the films to the Jets through Chicago so they would arrive a day or two late, reasoning that Davis, not he, would be blamed for the delay. Ewbank blamed Davis for heavily watering the Coliseum field to slow the Jets' speedy receivers, a tactic the Oakland co-owner credited to Madden.\n\nNBC's preparations for the Sunday, November 17 game at Oakland were routine. The game was to be televised to most of the country beginning at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, with Curt Gowdy and Al DeRogatis announcing. NBC hoped that viewers who tuned their television channel selectors to the game would not walk over to the television and change the channel or turn off the power switch, but would watch the evening's programming. They anticipated a good game, which would cause the audience to remain in their seats and watch the game in its entirety, \"a perfect lead in for the network's special presentation of \"Heidi\", the Johanna Spyri children's classic, which was scheduled to air after the game at 7 p.m. (EST)\". The television film was preempting \"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color\", the program normally shown by NBC on Sunday at that time. As the game started at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, the western half of the country would have to wait after the game for 7:00 p.m. local time before seeing \"Heidi\". Under television rules at the time, the Jets–Raiders game was blacked out within 90 miles of Oakland even though it was a sellout, leaving KRON-TV (channel 4, the local NBC affiliate serving Oakland at the time), and other NBC affiliates in nearby markets unable to show the game.\n\n\"Heidi\" was heavily promoted by NBC in television commercials and newspaper advertisements. The network hoped to gain a large audience, especially among families, whom the network anticipated would watch the entire two-hour film. Individual commercials for the film could not be purchased by advertisers; instead, the entire two-hour block was sold by NBC to watch manufacturer Timex, which would air the film and have its own commercials run during the broadcast. \"The New York Times\" touted \"Heidi\" as the best TV program of the day. Under the terms of the contract between Timex and NBC, \"Heidi\" had to go to air promptly at 7:00 p.m. Eastern (6:00 p.m. Central), and could not be delayed or joined in progress for any reason. NBC was inclined to favor the movie over the game, as sponsors like Timex were treated well in hopes of return business, while AFL football's television drawing power was as yet unproven. Dom Cosentino, in his 2014 article on the \"Heidi\" Game, points out the irony that Timex, a watch company, was the sponsor; the game would become infamous for its telecast, cut short because of time.\n\nSteven Travers, in his history of the Raiders, noted:\n\nThe nerve center for NBC was known as Broadcast Operations Control (BOC). Dick Cline, the network BOC supervisor for sports telecasts, prepared the series of network orders which would result in the game running as scheduled, followed by \"Heidi\". Cline had no reason to believe that the game would run over three hours; no professional football game presented by NBC ever had. However, other NBC executives stressed that \"Heidi\" must start as scheduled. NBC president Julian Goodman told his executives before the weekend that the well-sponsored, well-promoted film must start on time. NBC Sports executive producer Don \"Scotty\" Connal took care to tell the game producer, Don Ellis, that \"Heidi\" must start at 7:00 in the East, over Ellis' objection that he had been trained never to leave a game in progress. Connal told Ellis that NBC had sold the time, and was obligated to switch to the film.\n\nNBC ran three BOCs, in Burbank, California, Chicago, and New York City, with the last the largest. Cline was stationed at the New York BOC for the game. In the era before satellite transmission, programming was transmitted by coaxial cable line, with the cooperation of the telephone company. For this game, the Burbank BOC was to receive the feed from Oakland, insert commercials and network announcements, and send the modified feed via telephone wire to a switching station west of Chicago near the Mississippi River. An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the entire network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then to return to his base. He had been told to expect at 6:58:20 Eastern Time a network announcement for \"Heidi\", after which he was to cut the feed from Burbank, and the \"Heidi\" feed from New York would begin. This placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer would cut the feed, since he would act upon hearing the announcement.\n\nConnal, Cline's boss, was available in case of trouble, watching from his home in Connecticut. His superior, NBC Sports vice president Chet Simmons, who alternated weekends with Connal as on-call in the event of difficulties, was also watching from his Manhattan home. NBC president Goodman and NBC Sports head Carl Lindemann also turned on the game, which was expected to be exciting, in their New York area homes. The Buffalo Bills–San Diego Chargers game, shown as the first of a network doubleheader, was running long in its 2½-hour time slot, and NBC unhesitatingly cut its ending to go to the Jets and Raiders.\n\nOn the opening kickoff, the Jets were penalized for a personal foul against the Raiders. The Jets took an early 6–0 lead on 44-yard and 18-yard field goals made by kicker Jim Turner. The Raiders, led by quarterback Daryle Lamonica, who had been battling recent back and knee injuries, scored the game's first touchdown, taking a 7–6 lead on a 22-yard pass to receiver Warren Wells towards the end of the first quarter. The Raiders added to their lead when Lamonica threw a 48-yard pass to tight end Billy Cannon at the beginning of the second quarter.\n\nHowever, the Jets cut into Oakland's lead when Namath drove the offense 73 yards down field and ran the ball in for a 1-yard touchdown with five seconds remaining in the first half. The Jets lined up as if to kick the extra point, but holder and backup quarterback Babe Parilli tried to complete a two-point conversion pass, which fell incomplete. The Raiders led the Jets 14–12 at halftime.\n\nApproximately five minutes into the third quarter, Namath forged another Jets drive, following an interception by safety Jim Hudson, that ended with halfback Bill Mathis scoring a 4-yard touchdown behind blocking guard Dave Herman to give New York a 19–14 lead. The Raiders responded with an 80-yard drive that saw running back Charlie Smith score his first touchdown of the game on a 3-yard pass from Lamonica. The Raiders took a 22–19 lead on a two-point conversion with Lamonica completing the attempt to receiver Hewritt Dixon. During this drive, Hudson was ejected from the game after being called for a face mask penalty followed by a dispute with an official. As he left the field, he gave the jeering crowd the finger. The penalties caused the ball to be placed at the Jets' 3-yard line, and Smith scored for Oakland one play later.\n\nThe fourth quarter began with Smith fumbling the football with Oakland in scoring position. New York defensive end Gerry Philbin recovered the football at the Jets' 3-yard line setting up a 97-yard drive, consisting entirely of two Namath passes to Don Maynard, who was covered by Raiders' rookie cornerback George Atkinson. The 50-yard touchdown pass followed a 47-yard throw, and gave the Jets a 26–22 lead. Turner added another field goal to the Jets' total, giving them a 29–22 lead. The Raiders promptly responded with Lamonica orchestrating an 88-yard drive that ended with a 22-yard pass to receiver Fred Biletnikoff with less than four minutes remaining in the game, tying the contest.\n\nTurner made a 26-yard field goal to break the tie and give the Jets a three-point lead with a little over a minute remaining in the game. Turner kicked the ball off to the Raiders' Smith, who took the kick out of the end zone and to Oakland's own 22-yard line. Lamonica completed to Smith for an apparent touchdown, but the play was called back due to a penalty, causing New York cornerback Johnny Sample to say to Lamonica, \"Nice try, Lamonica. Better luck next year.\" On first down, Smith caught a 20-yard reception from Lamonica, while a 15-yard penalty was assessed against the Jets when a player grabbed Smith's facemask, moving the ball to the Jets' 43-yard line. On the ensuing play, Lamonica threw another pass to Smith who outpaced Jets safety Mike D'Amato, who replaced the ejected Jim Hudson, for a 43-yard touchdown. Kicker George Blanda made the extra point attempt which gave the Raiders a 36–32 lead.\n\nWith 42 seconds remaining, the Jets still had a chance to score; however, on the kickoff, New York return man Earl Christy fumbled the ball at the Jets' 12-yard line when he was tackled by Raiders linebacker Bill Budness. Oakland reserve running back Preston Ridlehuber picked up the fumbled ball and ran into the end zone, which with another Blanda extra point gave the Raiders a 43–32 lead, deflating any hopes of the Jets coming back to win the contest. Ridlehuber could not remember whether AFL rules permitted advancing a fumbled kickoff return (they did), so tried to make it appear he was entering the end zone with the same motion he gathered in the ball. Oakland kicked off to New York again, but it could do little with the ball in the final seconds, and the game ended.\n\nThe two starting quarterbacks combined for 31 incomplete passes, with the clock stopping on each incompletion, and the officials called 19 penalties, leading to more clock stoppages. Each team used all six of its allocated timeouts, and the many scores led to additional commercial breaks. At halftime, Connal called Cline, and without urgency discussed the fact that the game seemed to be running longer than expected.\n\nAs the fourth quarter began, it was 6:20 EST, and NBC executives began to realize the game might not end by 7:00. NBC Sports vice president Chet Simmons recalled:\n\nConnal, watching the game from his home in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, also noticed the fourth quarter was running \"terribly slow\". At 6:45, he called Cline again, and both men agreed the game would not end on time. Both supported running the end of the game, but given Goodman's instructions, his permission was required. Connal agreed to call NBC Sports president Lindemann, and that he and Lindemann would then speak to Goodman. After promising Cline a return call, Connal reached Lindemann by telephone. Lindemann agreed that the end of the game should be broadcast, and both men began trying to reach Goodman. Lindemann was successful in reaching Goodman, and asked the network president, \"What about the instruction to broadcast operations control that \"Heidi\" had to go on at 7:00 ET, no matter what?\" Goodman replied, \"That's crazy. It's a terrible idea.\" Lindemann then set up a three-way conversation with himself, Goodman and NBC Television president Don Durgin. After several minutes of discussion, Durgin agreed to delay the start of \"Heidi\" until after the game was completed. Sportswriter Kyle Garlett, in his history of sports gaffes, noted, \"And even though earlier executives had told [Cline] to make sure he started \"Heidi\" on time, those same executives changed their minds late in the game.\"\n\nCline, watching the clock nervously, attempted to call Connal back, only to find both lines busy. He waited as long as he could, then made one final, unsuccessful attempt. Unknown to Cline, Connal was talking to Goodman, who had agreed to \"slide the network\", that is, start \"Heidi\" as soon as Curt Gowdy signed off from the game. Connal called the game producer, Ellis, in Oakland, to tell him the news, then called the BOC supervisor in Burbank – who, not knowing Connal, refused his order, and insisted on speaking with Goodman directly. As Goodman had disconnected to allow Connal to call Oakland, this could not be done.\n\nBeginning about 6:45, many members of the public began calling NBC network and affiliate switchboards. Some demanded the game be shown to its conclusion; others wanted to know if \"Heidi\" would start on time. These calls jammed the switchboards, and even blew repeated fuses in them, preventing the executives from getting through to each other to resolve the situation. NBC protocol required an operations order from Connal, to countermand the midweek written orders, but Cline received no call from the increasingly desperate Connal, who was frustrated by the switchboard issues. Without such an order, and not knowing of Goodman's approval, Cline made the decision that \"Heidi\" would start on time. The television audience saw Smith return Turner's kickoff out of the end zone to the Oakland 22-yard line with 1:01 remaining. Burbank BOC played the closing football theme and gave the word cue, to the outraged shock of Ellis and Connal, and the connection was irretrievably broken. Although the western United States continued to view the game, the eastern half of the nation instead saw a little girl on a Swiss mountain and was unaware that Oakland was in the course of scoring two touchdowns to win the game.\n\n\"Oakland Tribune\" reporter Bob Valli reported on the \"Heidi\" Game: \"Television missed one of football's most exciting and exhausting minutes of emotion. In that minute, Oakland fans saw despair turn to delirium.\"\n\nOn realizing that NBC was switching away from the game, Goodman said to Lindemann by phone, \"Where the hell has our football game gone?\" During the station break which began with the network announcement, Goodman called a BOC phone to which only he knew the number and which was not part of NBC's CIrcle-7 exchange (which blew a fuse 26 times in an hour). When Cline answered it, Goodman ordered him to go back to the game. Although Cline knew there was no way to reconnect the feed, he promised to do the best he could. By the time the game ended at 7:07, thousands of viewers were calling the network to complain about missing the end of the football game. Others called newspapers, television stations, even the New York City Police Department, both to seek the final score, and simply to vent. Humorist Art Buchwald wrote \"Men who wouldn't get out of their chairs in an earthquake rushed to the phone to scream obscenities [at the network].\" As people learned of the outcome, some became upset because Ridlehuber's touchdown meant the Raiders had won by more than the point spread of 7, and bets thought to be won were now lost. In Oakland, Gowdy and DeRogatis left the broadcast booth to tell Ellis that the final two minutes were the most exciting they had ever seen. Ellis replied, \"It's too bad America didn't see it.\" Realizing that the original call had been lost, Ellis had the two sportscasters re-create their descriptions of the two Raider touchdowns on tape.\n\nIn an attempt to inform the audience of the game's outcome, NBC displayed the message \"SPORTS BULLETIN: RAIDERS DEFEAT JETS 43-32\" as an on-screen news update during the film. It did so during a scene just as Heidi's paralyzed cousin Clara was taking her first, slow steps. According to sportswriter Jack Clary, \"The football fans were indignant when they saw what they had missed. The \"Heidi\" audience was peeved at having an ambulatory football score intrude on one of the story's more touching moments. Short of pre-empting \"Heidi\" for a skin flick, NBC could not have managed to alienate more viewers that evening.\"\n\nAt 8:30, Goodman issued a statement apologizing for the incident, and stating that he had missed the ending of the game \"as much as anybody\". He stated that it was \"a forgivable error committed by humans who were concerned about children expecting to see \"Heidi\"\". The following morning, Cline was called into a meeting with his bosses. He was told that if he had done anything other than what he did, NBC would have been at the mercy of Timex and Cline would have been fired. The network turned the fiasco into an advantage by subsequent self-mockery, promoting the following week's Jets game telecast with an advertisement showing Namath with Heidi on his shoulders, and running another ad with testimonials about \"Heidi\", the last: \"I didn't get a chance to see it, but I hear it was great\", signed by Namath. Other networks joined in: on the \"CBS Evening News\" the following Monday night (November 18), Harry Reasoner announced the \"result\" of the game: \"Heidi married the goat-herder\". That same evening, NBC's own \"Huntley-Brinkley Report\" aired the tape of the game's final minute, complete with the re-created Gowdy/DeRogatis commentary. On the \"ABC Evening News\", anchor Frank Reynolds read excerpts from \"Heidi\" while clips of the Raiders' two touchdowns were shown as cut-ins.\n\nTo prevent similar occurrences happening in future game telecasts, a special \"\"Heidi\" phone\", a hotline connected to a different exchange and unaffected by switchboard meltdowns, was installed in BOC. The network quickly changed its procedures to allow games to finish before other programming begins, which is now standard practice. Three weeks after the \"Heidi\" Game, NBC aired a special presentation of \"Pinocchio\" (a live-action version starring Peter Noone, the lead singer of the rock band Herman's Hermits, in the title role). In the promotional newspaper advertisement for the film, Pinocchio himself assured football fans that they would view the entire game before the film and that he would sooner cut off his nose than \"have them cut off\" the action. On December 15, the nationally televised game between the Raiders and the San Diego Chargers ran over its allotted time slot. NBC started \"The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" (the usual program airing at 7 p.m. EST) at 7:08 Eastern, and announced that all network programming that evening would be started eight minutes late. \"I can't remember when we've done anything like this before\", stated an NBC executive. \"It's very unusual.\"\n\nIn subsequent television contracts, the merged NFL required language which obligated the networks to show games to completion in the road team's television market. Other major professional sports leagues in North America, the NCAA, and even the International Olympic Committee also shared the same rule in regards to their own respective TV contracts. On November 23, 1975, NBC planned to air the heavily promoted children's film \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" at 7:00 p.m. Eastern, right after a game between the Raiders and Washington Redskins. When the game went into overtime, NBC stayed with it for almost 45 minutes and then joined the \"Wonka\" film in progress, prompting angry calls from parents.\n\nCline stated in 1989, \"I wonder if this \"Heidi\" thing will ever die ... maybe now that it's past 20 years people will stop asking me about it.\" In 1997 the \"Heidi\" Game was voted among the ten most memorable games in pro football history, and the most memorable regular season contest. In 2005, \"TV Guide\" designated the \"Heidi\" Game at #6 on its list of the \"100 Most Unexpected TV Moments\" in history. Interviewed by the magazine, Jennifer Edwards, title star of \"Heidi\", commented: \"My gravestone is gonna say, 'She was a great moment in sports.'\"\n\nCline summed up the events of the \"Heidi\" Game:\n\nThe Jets were enraged by the outcome of the game, for reasons unrelated to the television problems, of which they were initially unaware. Feeling that Hudson's disqualification was unjustified (his replacement, D'Amato, was beaten for the winning touchdown), assistant coach Walt Michaels chased after the officials, and he and team doctor James Nicholas banged on the door of their dressing room, complaining bitterly. Ewbank mentioned the officiating in his postgame press conference. When told of Michaels' actions, the head coach ordered, \"Get him out of there, it can only cost him money.\" Oakland coach Rauch told reporters, \"There were so many turning points which kept putting both teams back in the game, it's impossible to discuss them all.\"\n\nEwbank learned of the television problems in the locker room when he received a telephone call from his wife congratulating him on a Jets victory – Lucy Ewbank assumed the fact that the end of the game was not shown meant New York had won. Her husband profanely informed her of the game result. She was not the only Jets relative deceived – cornerback Johnny Sample flew back east after the game on personal business, and when his father picked him up at Philadelphia International Airport, he congratulated his son on a Jets triumph.\n\nMichaels accused Al Davis of getting the officials to inspect Turner's kicking shoes before a field goal attempt to see if they contained illegal metal plates, and called the Oakland team official \"a man who has never contributed anything to football\", to which Davis responded, \"It's utterly ridiculous, unbelievable. It seems the Jets always lose to us because of penalties. But I like them and don't want any feud in case we visit New York December 29 [if both teams qualify for the AFL Championship Game].\" The Jets left their white road uniforms in Oakland to be laundered and sent to them in San Diego, where they were to play their next game. The uniforms were not seen again once the team removed them in the Oakland locker room, and Jets management hastily ordered the green home uniforms, as well as the white uniforms the team had worn in the preseason, to be shipped from New York.\n\nWhile in California, Michaels complained by phone to Mel Hein, AFL supervisor of officials, stating that an official had cursed at Hudson, provoking a response which led to Hudson's ejection. Jets officials also showed excerpts from the game films to the sportswriters from the New York papers who were assigned to cover the team. Zimmerman, who wrote for the \"New York Post\", later stated, \"I never saw such ferocity on a football field in my life\" and remembered that the films showed Oakland defensive lineman Dan Birdwell punch Namath in the groin, causing him to remain on the ground for several minutes, though he did not have to leave the game. Birdwell's action was not penalized by the game officials. In early December, football Commissioner Pete Rozelle fined the Jets $2,000, Michaels $150, Hudson $200 (including a mandatory $50 fine for being ejected from the game), and Jets player John Elliott, also disqualified, $50; he had hit Oakland center Jim Otto. Rozelle criticized Ewbank and Michaels for their \"extreme bad manners\" while criticizing the officials and cited the Jets' screening of the game excerpts as a factor contributing to the team's fine. To avoid adverse fan reaction, the AFL reassigned field judge Frank Kirkland, whom Hudson had accused of using foul language, from the December 1 Jets game against the Miami Dolphins at Shea Stadium, to another game.\n\nThe Jets defeated San Diego 37–15 and clinched the AFL East four days later when the second-place Oilers lost to the Chiefs in a Thanksgiving Day game. The Raiders finished tied for the AFL West title with Kansas City; they then defeated the Chiefs in a tie-breaking playoff game. This set up a December 29 rematch between the Jets and Raiders in the AFL Championship.\n\nThe Jets hosted the Raiders at Shea Stadium on a windy December afternoon to determine who would play in Super Bowl III against the NFL champions, who proved to be the Baltimore Colts. The Jets defeated the Raiders, 27–23. Two weeks later, the Jets defeated the Colts in the Super Bowl. According to sportswriter Doyle Dietz, in the Jets' upset victory (the Colts were favored by as many as 19½ points), \"the American Football League came of age\". Madden later stated that the Jets' Super Bowl upset \"was great for the history of the game, but a part of me has always felt that should have been [the Raiders] who were the first AFL team to do it ... [Super Bowl III] changed pro football. But I will always believe we would have beaten the Colts, too.\"\n\nIn 1988, Namath and Madden, by then both television analysts, were interviewed for the 20th anniversary of the \"Heidi\" Game. According to Madden, the Oakland victory in the \"Heidi\" Game \"was kind of the start of the Raiders being a great team. One of the things we were doing was getting these fantastic come-from-behind things ... We didn't even know about the \"Heidi\" thing until we read about it the next day.\" Namath noted, \"When I remember that game, it brings to mind the revenge factor we had against them going into the championship game. We paid them back then\", to which Madden chuckled, \"He's full of crap.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It was invented by Kru Krae Suppawanich in 1901 during the reign of King Mongkut (King Rama IV). He developed it while trying to construct a Hun Laung (Royal Thai puppet), which he found involved too many complicated structures and too many strings. He decreased the number of the strings inside the puppet, and thus invented \"hun la korn lek\". His first performance was in Varadis Palace.\n\nKru Kare continued performing with his puppets, but after World War II he found he was growing older, and that \"hun la korn lek\" was beginning to decrease in popularity. He passed 30 of his puppets onto his daughter-in-law, and the rest of his puppets were \"drowned\" in the Chao Phraya River. Later on, his daughter-in-law passed the remaining puppets on to Sakorn Yang-keawsot (English nickname Joe Louis) because of his ability in performing with the puppets. \"Hun la korn lek\" was brought back to the public eye by the ministry of culture at the celebration of the 200th anniversary of Bangkok in 1985, and has been publicly performed continuously ever since.\n\n1. All the structures and head are molded from clay to generate a character with a human-like appearance.\n\n2. These clay pieces are covered with paper and allowed to dry in the sun.\n\n3. Arms and legs are made from fabric which is filled with cotton. Wooden foldable joints are attached so limbs have a lifelike movement.\n\n4. Hands and feet are carved from Thong Lang wood, a wood which is lightweight and carves easily.\n\n5. The pieces are painted.\n\n6. Costumes are made using handmade cloth and sewed by hand according to traditional Thai sewing methods.\n\n7. The face of the puppet is painted with colored clay to match the color of human skin. Eyes and lips are painted with poster paint.\n\nTo perform \"Hun la korn lek\", three puppeteers are each responsible for different functions. They need to have a thorough knowledge of basic Khon dance, and a lot of practice and teamwork are required for the three of them to perform together as one character. The first puppeteer controls the head and the right hand of the puppet. The second puppeteer controls the left hand of the puppet. The third puppeteer controls the feet of the puppet. They must be skillful and experienced enough to control every part in unison to produce a perfectly coordinated character.\n\n\"Hun la korn lek\" performances generally involve renditions of Thai Royal novels and traditional Thai novels, mainly Ramakein and Sang Thong. The play does not generally involve a performance of the whole story from beginning to end, but only one chosen part of the story which is divided into three acts. The story may be told in its original version or rearranged by the composer.\n"}

The film stars Alain Moussi, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Christopher Lambert, Ronaldinho, Mike Tyson and Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson. Aside from Moussi and Van Damme, Sara Malakul Lane and Sam Medina reprised their roles from the previous film.\n\nIt has been eighteen months since Kurt Sloane killed Tong Po and avenged the death of his brother Eric. Now a professional mixed martial artist, Kurt defeats Renato Sobral using a move he calls the \"Hurricane Armbar\", a hurricanrana into an armbar. Kurt has been plagued by nightmares where he and his wife Liu are on a train and he finds himself fighting on the train which ends with him falling into water and possibly drowning. After the fight, Kurt is met by two U.S. Marshals who inform him that he must return to Thailand to be implicated in the death of Tong Po.

During one encounter, Kurt runs into Briggs, an American boxer who soon bonds with Kurt and even offers him a way to go through the pain from the whippings. Kurt also soon learns that his Muay Thai teacher, Durand, is now training some of the prisoners, but reveals that for his troubles, he has been blinded.\n\nMoore, realizing Kurt still will not accept the offer, decides to take drastic measures and finds Liu at the train station. Having bribed the same police officers she had accused of corruption to find Kurt, she gets additional help from old friend Gamon. However, Moore's goons, led by Somsak, have kidnapped Liu and that night, Crawford shows Kurt a video of Liu. Kurt decides to take the fight with Durand, Briggs, and fellow prisoners Big Country, Fabricio, Ronaldo, and a huge convict whose size nearly matches that of Mongkut. When Moore offers to take Kurt out of prison and in a private facility, Kurt agrees but only if his \"team\" continues their training and Moore agrees. Durand goes to one of Mongkut's training sessions only to learn the fighter is a product of bioengineering by Ivy League graduate Rupert, who has developed a combination of adrenaline and steroids, thus making Mongkut virtually invincible except for one small weakness: a glass jaw. Gamon joins in on the training and Kurt recognizes Somsak. Moore talks to Crawford about a test fight, to which Moore agrees and Kurt goes to a local nightclub where he and Durand once again meet Joseph King, whose last fighter decimated Kurt. Kurt faces King's new champion Moss while Durand distracts an onlooker and steals his cell phone to call his son Travis. Kurt defeats Moss and make a narrow escape with the help of Travis. \n\nThe next day, Kurt finds Somsak and chases him. After fighting more of Moore's men, Kurt catches up to Somsak and demands to know where Liu is. Liu is being held in Moore's apartment. Kurt, Gamon, and Travis take on Moore's men with Kurt facing Moore's two female valets in a room full of mirrors only to defeat them, finding Liu and rescuing her. When O'Keefe, Moore's right hand man, leads an ambush to stop the group, Mongkut arrives. He is about to hit Kurt when Liu steps in and Mongkut hits her hard in the stomach, knocking her unconscious. An angry Kurt tells Crawford to tell Moore he will face Mongkut anytime and anywhere. Liu is comatose in the hospital for a few days until she wakes up and learns Kurt has taken the fight. She fully accepts his decision. \n\nThe fight is set at the old Muay Thai temple with both Kurt and Mongkut ready to fight. Mongkut proves to be too much for Kurt and mid-way through, Mongkut throws Kurt to a statue, virtually killing him. When it is believed that Kurt has died from his injuries, Liu finds Rupert's suitcase of adrenaline and uses a needle to revive Kurt. Awakening, Kurt finds a second wind and despite getting some of the upper hand, Mongkut once again throws Kurt towards a statue and this time, takes him to a nearby fountain to drown him. Kurt imagines himself once again drowning as he did in his dream, but overhears the voices of Liu and Durand, prompting him to \"swim out\". Kurt grabs a chain and wraps it around his fist, enabling him to match Mongkut punch for punch. Using his skills, Kurt gets the upper hand and knocks Mongkut out. When Mongkut comes back up, Kurt resorts to taking Mongkut down with the chain, wrapping it around his neck and choking him out, resulting in Mongkut's neck breaking. Kurt has won and is surrounded by Durand, Liu, Gamon, and Travis. Hearing the news that Kurt has beaten Mongkut, Briggs is seen smiling in his prison cell.\n\nAn end credit sequence shows outtakes, following by an epilogue of Kurt once again in the MMA ring as he prepares for his next fight against Mauricio Rua.\n\n\nOn November 24, 2015, financiers Headmon Entertainment and Acme Rocket Fuel announced the sequel to the film \"\", titled \"Kickboxer 2: Retaliation\". Rob Hickman would produce the film through Our House Productions along with Dimitri Logothetis through Acme Rocket Fuel and executive produced by Steven Swadling and Larry Nealy. The film retitled \"Kickboxer: Retaliation\", began pre-production in February 2016, and Dimitri Logothetis was announced to be film's director and writer, while Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson was cast to play the role of a fighter. On May 23, 2016, Ultimate Fighting Championship's Paige VanZant was cast in the film to make her feature debut, with other cast returning; Alain Moussi, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Sara Malakul Lane. Sam Medina, and Steven Swadling. On May 25, 2016, former world champion boxer Mike Tyson was announced to play a tough convict forced into a world of fighting behind bars.\n\nIn July, UFC fighter Paige VanZant, who was set to make her film debut in the film as \"Gamon\", left the project to focus on an upcoming fight. Jessica Jann would replace her in the role. Originally a small role in the film, UFC fighter Roy \"Big Country\" Nelson's role was expanded. At a press conference in Bangkok, it was announced that Christopher Lambert joined joined the cast as Thomas Moore, an ex-pat and martial artist who is the one responsible for coercing Kurt to face Mongkut.\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began in mid-May 2016, in California and Nevada. In July, filming began in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nWell Go USA Entertainment released the film in a limited theatrical release and on Demand platforms on January 26, 2018. The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 13, 2018.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 11 reviews, and an average rating of 6.7/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nOn August 31, 2016, producer Rob Hickman announced the name of the third and final installment of the trilogy as \"Kickboxer: Syndicate\", which begins shooting in the summer of 2017. It was later renamed as \"Kickboxer: Armageddon\" and is set to begin production in 2018.\n\n"}
{"id": "579577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=579577", "title": "Knight-errant", "text": "Knight-errant\n\nA knight-errant (or knight errant, without the hyphen) is a figure of medieval chivalric romance literature. The adjective \"errant\" (meaning \"wandering, roving\") indicates how the knight-errant would wander the land in search of adventures to prove his chivalric virtues, either in knightly duels (pas d'armes) or in some other pursuit of courtly love.\n\nThe knight errant is a character that has broken away from the world of his origin, in order to go off on his own to right wrongs or to test and assert his own chivalric ideals. He is motivated by idealism and goals that are often illusory. In medieval Europe, knight-errantry existed in literature, though fictional works from this time often were presented as non-fiction.\n\nThe template of the knight-errant were the heroes of the Round Table of the Arthurian cycle such as Gawain, Lancelot and Percival. The quest \"par excellence\" in pursuit of which these knights wandered the lands is that of the Holy Grail, such as in \"Perceval, the Story of the Grail\" written by Chrétien de Troyes in the 1180s.\n\nThe character of the wandering knight existed in romantic literature as it developed during the late 12th century. However, the term \"knight-errant\" was to come later; its first extant usage occurs in the 14th-century poem \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\".\nKnight-errantry tales remained popular with courtly audiences throughout the Late Middle Ages. They were written in Middle French, in Middle English and in Middle German. In the 16th century, the genre became highly popular in the Iberian Peninsula; \"Amadis de Gaula\" was one of the most successful knight-errantry tales of this period. In \"Don Quixote\" (1605), Cervantes burlesqued the romances and their popularity. Tales of knight-errantry then fell out of fashion for two centuries, until they re-emerged in the form of the historical novel in Romanticism.\n\nA knight-errant typically performed all his deeds in the name of a lady, and invoked her name before performing an exploit. In more sublimated forms of knight-errantry, pure moralist idealism rather than romantic inspiration motivated the knight-errant (as in the case of Sir Galahad). Such a knight might well be outside the structure of feudalism, wandering solely to perform noble exploits (and perhaps to find a lord to give his service to), but might also be in service to a king or lord, traveling either in pursuit of a specific duty that his overlord charged him with, or to put down evildoers in general. This quest sends a knight on adventures much like the ones of a knight in search of them, as he happens on the same marvels. In \"The Faerie Queene\", St. George is sent to rescue Una's parents' kingdom from a dragon, and Guyon has no such quest, but both knights encounter perils and adventures.\n\nIn the romances, his adventures frequently included greater foes than other knights, including giants, enchantresses, or dragons. They may also gain help that is out of ordinary. Sir Ywain assisted a lion against a serpent, and was thereafter accompanied by it, becoming the Knight of the Lion. Other knights-errant have been assisted by wild men of the woods, as in \"Valentine and Orson\", or, like Guillaume de Palerme, by wolves that were, in fact, enchanted princes.\n\nThe protagonist of Cormac McCarthy’s novel \"All the Pretty Horses,\" John Grady Cole, is said to be based specifically on Sir Gawain, of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". Both characters share a number of aspects and traits; both are rooted in the myths of a past that no longer exists, and both live by codes of conduct from a previous era.\n\nDon Quixote is an early 17th-century parody of the genre, in reaction to the extreme popularity which late medieval romances such as \"Amadis de Gaula\" came to enjoy in the Iberian Peninsula in the 16th century.\n\nIn Jean Giraudoux’s play, Ondine, which starred Audrey Hepburn on Broadway in 1954, a knight-errant appears, during a storm, at the humble home of a fisherman and his wife.\n\nA depiction of knight-errantry in the modern historical novel is found in \"Sir Nigel\" by Arthur Conan Doyle (1906).\n\nThe knight-errant stock character became the trope of the \"knight in shining armour\" in depiction of the Middle Ages in popular culture, and the term came to be used also outside of medieval drama, as in \"The Dark Knight\" as a title of Batman.\n\nIn the epic fantasy series \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", there is a class of knights referred to as Hedge Knights. A Hedge Knight is a wandering knight without a master, and many are quite poor. Hedge knights travel the length and breadth of Westeros looking for gainful employment, and their name comes from the propensity to sleep out in the open air or in forests when they cannot afford lodging. The life of a hedge knight is depicted in the Tales of Dunk and Egg.\n\nEast Slavic \"bylina\" (epic poetry) feature bogatyrs, knights-errant who served as protectors of their homeland, and occasionally as adventurers. Some of them are presumed to be historical figures, while others are fictional and possibly descend from Slavic mythology. Most tales about bogatyrs revolve around the court of Vladimir I of Kiev. Three popular bogatyrs—Ilya Muromets, Dobrynya Nikitich and Alyosha Popovich (famously painted by Victor Vasnetsov)—are said to have served him.\n\nYouxia, Chinese knights-errant, traveled solo protecting common folk from oppressive regimes. Unlike their European counterpart, they did not come from any particular social caste and were anything from soldiers to poets. There is even a popular literary tradition that arose during the Tang Dynasty which centered on Negrito-slaves who used supernatural physical abilities to save kidnapped damsels in distress and to swim to the bottom of raging rivers to retrieve treasures for their Feudal Lords (see Kunlun Nu).\nA youxia who excels or is renowned for martial prowess or skills is usually called wuxia.\n\nIn Japan, the expression Musha shugyō described a Samurai who wanting to test his abilities in real life conditions would travel the land and engage in duels along the way.\n\n"}

The print edition of \"Muscat Daily\" is the largest-selling English daily in Oman with nearly 33,000 copies sold every day on Omani weekdays (Saturday to Wednesday) . The paper does not have a weekend edition currently. \"Muscat Daily\" is owned by Apex Press and Publishing, a leading Omani publishing company which publishes several other titles including the hugely popular \"TheWeek\", \"Business Today\", \"Oman Today\", \"Usrat Al Youm\", \"Al Isbou'a\", \"Business Directory\" and \"Tribute\". Apex also does occasional projects like the Map of Oman, Apex Map of Muscat, The Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque coffee table book etc. Apex Press and Publishing was founded in 1980 by Omani businessman Saleh Zakwani, who is also the current chairman of the company.\n\nThe newspaper celebrated its first anniversary on October 13. \"Muscat Daily\" is accessible online at muscatdaily.com.\n\nEditorial content is generated by an in-house team of reporters and writers in the case of Oman news. International news is sourced from a variety of newswires including The New York Times Syndicate and News Service, BBC, dpa, TMS Features, IANS, Asian News Network. The paper runs crosswords provided by \"The Guardian\".\n\nThe newspaper is organized in two sections. Section 1 is the main section with 20 pages containing Oman (National) news, Regional and World news, Op-Ed and Sports.\nSection 2 has Business, Crosswords, Sudoku puzzles, quiz questions and a Features section.\nOn Wednesdays, \"TheWeek\" newspaper is delivered home to \"Muscat Daily\" subscribers as weekend reading.\n\nThe newspaper which features a bright tulip orange and black theme was designed by its creative director, Benoite Lopes, in a seven column format. The design has received favorable reviews at design workshops run by WAN-IFRA the biggest association of publishers in the world. \"Muscat Daily\" is still not a full colour paper as it is printed at the Omani government-owned \"Oman Observer\" press.\n\nIn February 2010, parent company Apex Press and Publishing announced that they had signed an agreement to purchase a Goss Community SSC Press with a rated speed of 35,000 copies per hour from the American printing press manufacturer.\n\nApex had previously printed its titles with other printers since it had never invested in its own press. Mohana Prabhakar, chief executive and managing editor of Apex Press and Publishing, was quoted as saying that using contract printers had become an increasing problem as the company expanded its portfolio of titles. This was the main reason that Apex finally decided to invest in its own printing press despite the extra printing capacity available in the country with other printers.\n\nDespite the relative young age of the newspaper, the circulation quickly picked up and the paper went on to become the largest selling English-language daily in the Sultanate of Oman by mid-2010. The main reason quoted by industry analysts for this was the low annual subscription fees of the newspaper in a market which traditionally had fewer than 1,000 residential subscribers for English dailies before the entry of \"Muscat Daily\". An annual subscription to Muscat Daily cost OMR 50 (about $130) compared to the OMR 72 ($186) of competitors likes \"Times of Oman\", \"Oman Tribune\" and \"Oman Daily Observer\".\n\n\"Muscat Daily\" has been described by analysts as having a centrist liberal bias on most issues. Overall, the stated mission of the paper and its management is to report and not sensationalise or editorialise matters.\n\n\"Muscat Daily\" has been criticized as being a late entry into the newspaper arena in Oman at a time when newspaper subscriptions are falling in the West. In a scathing critique, Eliott Beer posted on AdNation Middle East's website, \"Apparently no-one's told the guys in Oman about the demise of traditional print media (it's dead, you know) - some publisher's only gone and started up another newspaper.\"\n\nHowever, parent company Apex Press and Publishing says that newspaper circulations are increasing in emerging markets and since the penetration of broadband in Oman is still only about 12% of the total population, it does not see any threat to its print business. Muscat Daily was launched as a direct competitor to other English language dailies in Oman including the \"Times of Oman\", \"Oman Tribune\" and the government-run \"Oman Daily Observer\".\n\nThe role that \"Muscat Daily\" has played in pushing the boundaries of media freedom and censorship in 'the sleepy sultanate' has been recognized by world media, particularly those that work in markets where media freedom is guaranteed. An article in \"Christian Science Monitor\" on the protests and media freedom in Oman said:\n\n\"\"The fact that Oman's first civil unrest in 40 years left at least one person dead in a northern port city here was big news. But it was even bigger news that the English-language Muscat Daily declared \"Black Sunday in Sohar\" on its front page and carried a half-page photograph showing smoke filling the sky above a roundabout seized by protesters.\"\"\n\nThe article was subsequently carried in other prominent newspapers and publications across the world including Gulf News, Yahoo News, MinnPost \n\nAccording to an article in \"The Economist\" in early March 2011, \"Newspapers such as the Muscat Daily have begun to cover the protests in a way that would have been unthinkable even a week ago.\"\n\nAmong other international media, Spanish newspaper \"El País\" has quoted \"Muscat Daily\" in its coverage of the 2011 Omani protests and the related action by the government and other actors in the 2011 protests. Talking about the reforms instituted by Sultan Qaboos, in the wake of the protests it said:\n\"Según datos recabados por el Muscat Daily, la medida beneficia a 130.000 ciudadanos, el 73% de todos los que trabajan ese sector.\" (Translation: According to data compiled by Muscat Daily, the new measures will benefit about 130,000 people or about 73% of those working in the private sector.)\n"}

Each player in turn tries to remove a stick from the pile without disturbing any of the others. The game is known by several names including jackstraws (or jack straws), spellicans, and spillikins, and appears in a line of a nursery rhyme: \"...five, six, pick-up sticks!\" \n\nThe sticks may be made of almost any material, such as ivory, bone, wood, bamboo, straw, reed, rush, yarrow, or plastics.\nSome Haida First Nation pick-up sticks are plain maple wood decorated with abalone shell and copper.\n\nToday, the most common pick-up sticks game is Mikado. It remains difficult in all variations.\n\nThe object of the game is to pick up the most sticks.\n\nTo begin the game, a bundle of sticks is randomly distributed so that they end up in a tangled pile. The more tangled the resulting disarray, the more challenging the game. In some versions of the game, any isolated sticks, or sticks lying alone, are removed.\n\nThe players attempt to remove a single stick, without moving any other stick. In some versions of the game, players use a tool to move the stick away from the pile; this \"tool\" may be one of the sticks, held aside before the game begins. In other versions, players must pick up the sticks by hand. In either case, players must not move any other things while attempting to remove the said stick; if any other stick moves, his turn ends immediately and he loses a turn. Players who successfully pick up a stick can then have another turn; the player keeps removing sticks until he causes a secondary stick to move.\n\nIn some versions of the game, different-coloured sticks are worth different numbers of points, and the winner is the person with the highest score.\n\nThe pieces in a jackstraw set are often thematically related to farmyard tools, such as ladders, rakes, shovels, and hoes. There are typically around 45 pieces in a set and made of wood, plastic, bone, or ivory. In addition to the jackstraws themselves, there is typically a helper piece with a hooked end for use in snagging and manipulating pieces. Each piece has a point value, with more challenging pieces being worth more points.\n\n\nPlayers try to win points by removing jackstraws – in the shapes of various tools – from the pile, one at a time.\n\n\nAt the end of the game, players total the point values of their jackstraws.

If he receives more than one telegram, or none at all, no one will get any money, and cooperation between players is forbidden. In this situation, the superrational thing to do is to send a telegram with probability 1/20.\n\nA similar game, referred to as a \"Luring Lottery\", was actually played by the editors of \"Scientific American\" in the 1980s. To enter the contest once, readers had to send in a postcard with the number \"1\" written on it. They were also explicitly permitted to submit as many entries as they wished by sending in a single postcard bearing the number of entries they wished to submit. The prize was one million dollars divided by the total number of entries received, to be awarded to the submitter of a randomly chosen entry. Thus a reader who submitted a large number of entries increased his or her chances of winning but reduced the maximum possible value of the prize. It can be shown mathematically that one maximizes one's average winnings in this game by submitting a number of entries equal to the total number of entries of others. Of course, if others take this into account, then this strategy translates into a runaway reaction to unbounded number of entries being submitted.\n\nAccording to the magazine, the superrational thing was for each contestant to roll a simulated die with the number of sides equal to the number of expected responders (about 5% of the readership), and then send \"1\" if you roll \"1\". If all contestants had followed this strategy, it is possible that the magazine would have received a single postcard, with a \"1\", and would have had to pay a million dollars to the sender of that postcard. Reputedly the publisher and owners were very concerned about betting the company on a game.\n\nAlthough the magazine had previously discussed the concept of superrationality from which the above-mentioned algorithm can be deduced, many of the contestants submitted entries consisting of an astronomically large number (including several who entered a googolplex).

{"id": "397559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=397559", "title": "Pride Fighting Championships", "text": "Pride Fighting Championships\n\nPride Fighting Championships (Pride or Pride FC, founded as KRS-Pride) was a Japanese mixed martial arts promotion company. Its inaugural event was held at the Tokyo Dome on October 11, 1997. Pride held more than sixty mixed martial arts events, broadcast to about 40 countries worldwide. Pride held the largest live MMA event audience record of 91,107 people at the Pride and K-1 co-production, \"Shockwave/Dynamite\", held in August 2002, as well as the audience record of over 67,450 people at the \"Pride Final Conflict 2003\". For ten years PRIDE was one of the most popular MMA organizations in the world.\n\nIn March 2007, Dream Stage Entertainment (DSE) sold Pride to Lorenzo Fertitta and Frank Fertitta III, co-owners of Zuffa, which, at the time, owned the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). While remaining as legally separate entities with separate managements, the two promotions were set to cooperate in a manner akin to the AFL-NFL merger. However, such an arrangement did not materialize, and in October 2007, Pride Worldwide's Japanese staff was laid off, marking the end of the organization as an active fight promoter. As a result, many of the Pride staff left to form a new organization alongside K-1 parent company Fighting and Entertainment Group. That new organization, founded in February 2008, was named Dream.\n\nIn 2015, Pride's co-founder and former president Nobuyuki Sakakibara established Rizin Fighting Federation in Japan with the same philosophy and ambition as for the defunct Pride organization.\n\nThe precursors of Pride were the Japanese mixed martial arts competitions UWF International (founded in 1991) and Pancrase (founded in 1993). Pride Fighting Championships was initially conceived of in 1997, to match popular Japanese pro-wrestler Nobuhiko Takada with Rickson Gracie, the purported champion of the Gracie family of Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners. The event, held at the Tokyo Dome on October 11, 1997, and organised by Hiromichi Momose, Naoto Morishita and Nobuyuki Sakakibara from KRS (Kakutougi Revolutionary Spirits) promotion, attracted 47,000 fans, as well as Japanese mass media attention. The success of the first event enabled its promoters to hold a regular series of mixed martial arts events, and a year later in 1998, to promote a rematch between Takada and Gracie. With K-1 enjoying popularity in Japan, Pride began to compete with monthly showings on Fuji Television, as well as pay per view on the newly formed satellite television channel SKY PerfecTV. Following the fourth event, the series was taken over by the Dream Stage Entertainment, formed by the members of the dissolved KRS, and it was accordingly renamed as the Pride Fighting Championships, with Morishita as its first chairman.\n\nIn 2000, Pride hosted the first \"Pride Grand Prix\", a two-part openweight tournament held to find the \"world's best fighter\". The tournament was held over the course of two events, with sixteen fighters competing in an opening round and the eight winners returning three months later for the final round. The second round of the tournament marked the first time Pride was broadcast in the United States and featured American fighter Mark Coleman winning the tournament by defeating Igor Vovchanchyn in the final round.\n\nIn August 2002, Pride teamed up with Japan's leading kickboxing and fight promotion, K-1, and held the world's biggest fight event, \"Shockwave\" (known as \"Pride/K-1 Dynamite!!\" in Japan), which attracted over 71,000 fans.\n\nOn January 13, 2003, the Pride MMA production was thrown into turmoil when DSE president Naoto Morishita was found dead hanging by his neck in his hotel room, apparently after his mistress told him she wanted to end their affair. Speculation loomed whether this could possibly be the real reason, as trouble with tax authorities and the yakuza have also been speculated as playing a role. Nobuyuki Sakakibara later assumed the presidency, later joined by Takada as a general manager.\n\nIn 2003 Pride introduced the \"Bushido\" series of events, which focused mainly, but not exclusively, on the lighter weight classes of lightweights and welterweights. The Bushido series also stressed a faster pace, with bouts consisting of only one ten-minute round and one five-minute round, as well as quicker referee intervention of stalling tactics, using the new \"yellow card\" system of purse deduction.\n\nAlso in 2003, Pride returned to the tournament format, with a middleweight grand prix spanning two events, \"Pride Total Elimination 2003\" and \"Final Conflict 2003\". The format was expanded to three events in 2004, adding \"Critical Countdown 2004\" as the second round. Pride would go on to hold annual tournaments, a heavyweight tournament in 2004, a middleweight in 2005, and an openweight in 2006.\n\nIn 2006 DSE announced it would showcase Pride alongside the Ultimate Fighting Championship, North America's largest MMA event, and would be integrating their fighters, including Wanderlei Silva and Kazuyuki Fujita, at a UFC MMA show in November. However, Dana White, speaking on behalf of Zuffa then commented that the announced bout between Chuck Liddell and Wanderlei Silva was unlikely to happen because \"the Japanese are very hard to do business with\". This statement was likely due to the failure of previous attempts between Zuffa and DSE to organize a fighter exchange agreement. Specifically after entering Liddell in Pride's 2003 middleweight tournament, which was also with the intention of Liddell eventually fighting Silva, which fell through when Liddell lost in the semi-finals to Quinton Jackson (Jackson subsequently lost to Silva by technical knockout in the finals.)\n\nPride continued to enjoy success, holding roughly ten events per year, and even out-drawing rival K-1 at the annual New Year's Eve show \"Pride Shockwave 2005\". On October 21, 2006, Pride held its first MMA event in US, \"Pride 32: The Real Deal\" took place in front of an audience of 11,727 at the Thomas & Mack Center in Paradise, Nevada, and was the first Pride event to be held outside Japan.\n\nOn June 5, 2006, the Fuji Network announced that they were terminating their television contract with Pride Fighting Championships effective immediately due to a breach of contract by DSE. This left Pride with only SKY PerfecTV, a pay-per-view carrier, as a television outlet in Japan, and the loss of the substantial revenues from the Fuji deal threatened its sustainability. Dream was surrounded by speculation in the Japanese media, especially in the Japanese tabloid \"Shukan Gendai\", that it may be a front for the notorious yakuza crime organization. Dream responded to the loss by stating they will continue with their schedule as currently planned, including an event in Las Vegas, \"Pride 33: Second Coming\" which took place on February 24, 2007, Pride's second event outside Japan.\n\nIn late 2006, DSE hinted at plans for Mike Tyson to fight in the organization's New Year's Eve show. Tyson was to face a Pride fighter under boxing rules. Since Tyson is not allowed to fight in Japan because of his criminal record, Pride wanted to stage the fight in an alternate country, possibly Macau, China. The fight would be broadcast live on large television screens in the Saitama Super Arena, where the regular mixed martial arts bouts were held. The fight did not occur, however.\n\nOn November 29, 2006, Pride announced the discontinuation of its Bushido events, with the intention of integrating the matches from lighter weight classes, mainly featured in Bushido, into regular Pride events. Pride also announced that future Grand Prix tournaments would take place on a four-year weight class cycle, with one Grand Prix per year. The first expected one, a lightweight Grand Prix, ended up being cancelled.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 27, 2007, Pride executives Nobuyuki Sakakibara and Nobuhiko Takada announced that Station Casinos Inc. magnate Lorenzo Fertitta, co-owner of Zuffa and its subsidiary MMA production Ultimate Fighting Championship, had made a deal to acquire all assets of Pride Fighting Championships from Dream Stage Entertainment after Pride 34: Kamikaze in a deal reportedly worth USD$65 million, though the figure was not publicly disclosed. Managing the assets under the newly created Pride FC Worldwide Holdings, LLC, including their video library and the contracts of the fighters currently on the Pride roster, the new management company had originally planned to continue to promote Pride events in Japan and keep to its previously announced schedule. Lorenzo Fertitta announced they planned to operate Pride separately from Zuffa's two MMA brands, the UFC and WEC, planned on having occasional crossover shows and matches, pitting fighters from Pride against fighters \"from the UFC,\" using the metaphor of the AFL-NFL merger to compare the situation.\n\nSubsequent remarks by Zuffa spokesperson Dana White however cast doubt as to what the new owners would actually do with Pride. After the sale officially closed on May 25, 2007, White remarked that he planned on bringing Pride's biggest names into UFC competition instead of keeping them in Pride and that they were still deciding on what to do with Pride itself. In later comments made in August 2007, White expressed doubt that Zuffa can resurrect Pride in Japan, claiming, \"I've [\"or\", \"we\"] pulled everything out of the trick box that I can and I can't get a TV deal over there with Pride. I don't think they want us there. I don't think they want me there.\"\n\nOn October 4, 2007, Pride Worldwide closed its Japanese office, laying off 20 people who were working there since the closing of DSE.\n\nThe final Pride events have been released on DVD under the Pride Worldwide label.\n\nPast fights from Pride are shown on \"Best of Pride Fighting Championships\". The program premiered January 15, 2010, on Spike TV. The program's host is Kenda Perez.\n\nPride Fighting Championships released two licensed video games during its time in business. As well as being featured in an Ultimate Fighting Championship game in 2012.\n\n\nPride's rules differed between main Pride events and Bushido events. It was announced on November 29, 2006, that Bushido events would be discontinued.\n\nPride matches consisted of three rounds; the first lasted ten minutes and the second and third each lasted five minutes. Intermissions between each round were two minutes long. In Pride events held in the United States, NSAC Unified MMA rules were used: non-title matches consisted of three five-minute rounds and title matches consisted of five five-minute rounds, both with 60-second intermissions between rounds.\n\nWhen two rounds of a Grand Prix took place on the same night, Grand Prix bouts consisted of two rounds, the first lasting ten minutes and the second lasting five. Intermissions between each round remained two minutes long.\n\nPride used a five-roped square ring with sides 7 m in length (approximately 23 ft). The same was used at Pride: Bushido events.\n\nPride allowed fighters latitude in their choice of attire but open finger gloves, a mouthguard and a protective cup were mandatory. Fighters were allowed to use tape on parts of their body or to wear a gi top, gi pants, wrestling shoes, kneepads, elbow pads, or ankle supports, and masks at their own discretion, though each was checked by the referee before the fight.\n\nMatches could be won via:\n\n\nPride Fighting Championships considered the following to be fouls:\n\nIn the event that a fighter was injured by illegal actions, then at the discretion of the referee and ring doctor, the round would attempt to be resumed after enough time had been given to the fighter to recover. Once the fight started again the fighters would be placed in the exact position when the referee called the time out. If the match could not be continued due to the severity of the injury then the fighter who perpetrated the action was disqualified.\n\n\nPride made special provisions for fights between fighters of different weight classes or fighters with a large weight difference in the same weight class. The lighter fighter was given a choice of whether or not to permit knees or kicks to the face when in the \"four points\" position in the following cases:\n\nThe word BUSHIDO translates from the Japanese language as \"the way of the warrior.\" More specifically, the term refers to the principals and moral code that developed among the samurai (military) class of Japan. Today, in the spirit of the samurai from Japan, PRIDE FC brings you the \"way of the warrior\" with its mixed martial arts event, BUSHIDO. Featuring a mixture of elite fighters as well as young up and coming talent, BUSHIDO presents the entire spectrum of weight classes, from lightweights to heavy weights. In addition, BUSHIDO provides flexibility for more experimental fight card formats, such as \"team\" competitions pitting country versus country, or fight team versus fight team. BUSHIDO also welcomes up and coming fighters, giving them an opportunity to prove themselves in BUSHIDO \"Challenge Matches.\"\n\nThere were a few minor differences from main Pride events:\n\nSome states' athletic commissions require mixed martial arts events to modify rules to match the \"Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Combat\", as introduced by the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board, and adopted by the Nevada State Athletic Commission in order to receive state sanctioning.\n\nPride's rules differed from the \"Unified Rules of Combat\" in the following ways:\n\nAt the announcement on March 27, 2007, that the Fertittas were purchasing Pride, it was stated that all future Pride events (after Pride 34) would be held under unified rules, eliminating 10-minute opening rounds, ground knees, stomps and more, though there were no more Pride events held to use these rules.\n\nEvents typically begin with the theme music entitled \"Pride\", composed by Yasuharu Takanashi. In addition to their main, \"numbered\" events, Pride have staged other series of events for different purposes.\n\nThe Pride GP (Grand Prix) is the name of a series of tournaments held by Pride. In addition to a money prize, a championship belt was given to the winner of each tournament, though this belt only denoted the tournament winner and would never be defended. However, Pride's Shockwave 2005 event crowned not only the welterweight and lightweight tournament champions, but also Pride's inaugural welterweight and lightweight champions. Of note is the amount of past and future champions that would participate in these tournaments.\n\nIn 2000, Pride held their first Grand Prix. With no weight limits, it is now considered to be their first openweight grand prix. Held across two events, Pride Grand Prix 2000 Opening Round featured first round bouts and Pride Grand Prix 2000 Finals featured the quarter finals, semi finals and final.\n\nThe concept was brought back in 2003, with a middleweight grand prix. Held across two cards, Pride Total Elimination 2003 featured the first round of the Grand Prix and Final Conflict 2003 featured the semi finals and final. Subsequent middleweight, heavyweight and openweight grands prix had taken place across three events when, in 2004, Critical Countdown was introduced for second round bouts. Both Critical Countdown and Final Conflict had a mix of Grand Prix and non-Grand Prix matches.\n\nIn 2007, it was announced that Pride would hold only one Grand Prix a year and it would rotate between each of their four established weight classes.\n\nExcept for the inaugural 2000 Grand Prix, tournament dates with only one round would adhere to normal Pride or Pride Bushido rules. For tournament dates that held two rounds, a fight had a 10-minute first round, followed by a two-minute rest period for the fighters, and then a five-minute last round.\n\nThe 2000 Finals held a 90-minute contest between Kazushi Sakuraba and Royce Gracie. Gracie had requested that there be no judging and no limit to the number of rounds. Sakuraba agreed to fight under these rules, and the contest went to a total of 90 minutes of fighting, after which Gracie's corner threw in the towel due to damage to Gracie's legs. Sakuraba advanced to the next round, fighting a fifteen-minute first round against eventual runner up Igor Vovchanchyn, after which Sakuraba's corner threw in the towel citing his exhaustion.\n\nWith Pride's numbered shows and Grands Prix focused on heavier fighters, in October 2003, Pride started a series of events entitled \"Bushido\". With the focus on lighter combatants, two weight classes, lightweight and welterweight, were formed at 73 and 83 kg respectively. After Pride Bushido 13, it was announced that the series would end and these weight classes would transfer to main Pride shows.\n\nIn 2005, Pride Bushido staged welterweight and lightweight Grands Prix. Two eight-man brackets were set up and the quarter finals and semi finals were held at Pride Bushido 9, along with an alternate bout in each bracket. The finals were held at Pride Shockwave 2005, with the winners subsequently being crowned as champions for their division. A sixteen-man welterweight grand prix was held in 2006.\n\nIn 2002, Pride launched \"The Best\", a series of shows featuring up-and-coming fighters, using an eight-sided roped ring. However, after the third show in October 2002, the series was discontinued. The concept was later refined into the Pride Bushido events.\n\nWhen Zuffa LLC bought Pride, it moved to unify the Pride middleweight and welterweight titles with its own light-heavyweight (205 lbs) and middleweight (185 lbs) titles. Dan Henderson, who held both the Pride middleweight and welterweight belts at the time of the Zuffa buy-out, was beaten in two unification bouts, first to Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson in September 2007 and then to middleweight Anderson Silva in March 2008.\n\nThe titleholders below were those who held the titles on April 8, 2007, the date of the last Pride FC promoted show.\n\n\"An asterisk (*) indicates that the tournament was also a title fight.\"\nThe following fighters have won a tournament or championship titles or were high contenders in Pride. Some have competed in different weight classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1439939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1439939", "title": "Pub names", "text": "Pub names\n\nPub names are used to identify and differentiate pubs. Many pubs are centuries old, from a time when their customers were often illiterate, but could recognise pictorial signs. Pub names have a variety of origins, from objects used as simple identification marks to the coats of arms of kings or local aristocrats and landowners. Other names come from historic events, livery companies, and occupations or craftsmen's guilds.\n\nUnlike Ireland, where the names of pubs tend to be based on the name of the owner, or a former owner, in mainland Britain this has been unusual, probably because pubs wanted names that could be related to an image on their pub sign, a key means of identifying them in an age of restricted literacy. In Australia a high proportion of older pubs have names ending in \"hotel\", and generally their names reflect hotel naming conventions. \n\nAlthough the word \"The\" appears on much pub signage, it is not considered to be an important part of the name, and is therefore ignored in the following examples. The word \"Ye\" is likewise ignored as it is only an archaic spelling of \"The\". Y represents an obsolete character (þ, the letter Thorn, which is nowadays used only in Icelandic) for the \"th\" sound and its later forms looked rather like a blackletter \"y\". It was never pronounced with a y sound. Similarly, other archaic spellings such as \"olde worlde\" are not distinguished below.\n\nNames like \"Fox and Hounds\", \"Dog and Duck\", \"Dog and Gun\", etc., refer to hunting. Animal names coupled with colours, such as \"White Hart\" and \"Red Lion\", are often heraldic. A white hart featured as the badge of King Richard II, while a red lion was the badge of John of Gaunt and a blue boar of the Earls of Oxford.\nSome pub chains in the UK adopt the same or similar names for many pubs as a means of brand expression. The principal examples of this are \"The Moon Under Water\", commonly used by the JD Wetherspoon chain, and inspired by George Orwell's 1946 essay in the \"Evening Standard\", \"The Moon Under Water\".) and the \"Tap and Spile\" brand name used by the now defunct Century Inns chain. The \"Slug and Lettuce\" is another example of a chain of food-based pubs with a prominent brand—founder Hugh Corbett had owned a small number of pubs, which he rechristened with humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors.\nBefore painted inn signs became commonplace, medieval publicans often identify their establishment by hanging or standing a distinctive object outside the pub. This tradition dates back to Roman times, when the owners of tabernae used to hang some vine leaves outside their property to show where wine was sold.\n\nSometimes the object was coloured, such as \"Blue Post\" or \"Blue Door\".\n\nThe ubiquity of the naming element \"arms\" shows how important heraldry has been in the naming of pubs. The simpler symbols of the heraldic badges of royalty or local nobility give rise to many of the most common pub names.\n\nNames starting with the word \"Three\" are often based on the arms of a London Livery company or trade guild :\nMany coats of arms appear as pub signs, usually honouring a local landowner.\nSome \"Arms\" signs refer to working occupations. These may show people undertaking such work or the arms of the appropriate London livery company. This class of name may be only just a name but there are stories behind some of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nImages from myths and legends are evocative and memorable.\n\nCommon enough today, the pairing of words in the name of an inn or tavern was rare before the mid-17th century, but by 1708 had become frequent enough for a pamphlet to complain of 'the variety and contradictory language of the signs', citing absurdities such as 'Bull and Mouth', 'Whale and Cow', and 'Shovel and Boot'. Two years later an essay in the \"Spectator\" echoed this complaint, deriding among others such contemporary paired names as 'Bell and Neat's Tongue', though accepting 'Cat and Fiddle'. A possible explanation for doubling of names is the combining of businesses, for example when a landlord of one pub moved to another premises. Fashion, as in the rise of intentionally amusing paired names like 'Slug and Lettuce' and 'Frog and Firkin' (see \"Puns, Jokes and Corruptions\" below) in the late 20th century, is responsible for many more recent pub names.\n\nSome pubs are known by the names of former landlords and landladies, for instance Nellie's (originally the White Horse) in Beverley, and Ma Pardoe's (officially the Olde Swan) in Netherton, West Midlands. The Baron of Beef, Welwyn, Hertfordshire is named after a nineteenth-century landlord, George Baron, listed in Kelly's Directory for 1890 as \"Butcher and Beer Retailer\". Others are named after various people.\n\nAn \"arms\" name, too, can derive from a pub's town.\nThe most common tree-based pub name is the Royal Oak, which refers to a Historical event.\n\nMany traditional pub names refer to the drinks available inside, most often beer.\n\nOther pub names refer to items of food to tempt the hungry traveller. For example, The Baron of Beef in Cambridge refers to a double sirloin joined at the backbone.\nAlthough puns became increasingly popular through the twentieth century, they should be considered with care. Supposed corruptions of foreign phrases usually have much simpler explanations. Many old names for pubs that appear nonsensical are often alleged to have come from corruptions of slogans or phrases, such as \"The Bag o'Nails\" (Bacchanals), \"The Cat and the Fiddle\" (Caton Fidele) and \"The Bull and Bush\", which purportedly celebrates the victory of Henry VIII at \"Boulogne Bouche\" or Boulogne-sur-Mer Harbour. Often, these corruptions evoke a visual image which comes to signify the pub; these images had particular importance for identifying a pub on signs and other media before literacy became widespread. Sometimes the basis of a nickname is not the name, but its pictorial representation on the sign that becomes corrupt, through weathering, or unskillful paintwork by an amateur artist. Apparently, many pubs called the Cat or Cat and Custard Pot were originally Tigers or Red Lions with signs that \"looked more like a cat\" in the opinion of locals.\n\n\nThe amount of religious symbolism in pub names decreased after Henry VIII's break from the church of Rome. For instance, many pubs now called the King's Head were originally called the Pope's Head.\n\nRoyal names have always been popular (except under the Commonwealth). It demonstrated the landlord's loyalty to authority (whether he was loyal or not), especially after the restoration of the monarchy.\n\nFootball club nicknames include:\n\nA large number of pubs called the Railway, the Station, the Railway Hotel, etc. are situated near current or defunct rail stations.\nFive stations on the London Underground system are named after pubs: Royal Oak, Elephant & Castle, Angel, Manor House, Swiss Cottage. The area of Maida Vale, which has a Bakerloo line station, is named after a pub called the \"Heroes of Maida\" after the Battle of Maida in 1806.\n\nMainline stations named after pubs include Bat & Ball in Sevenoaks.\n\nAn authoritative list of the most common pub names in Great Britain is hard to establish, owing to ambiguity in what classifies as a pub as opposed to a licensed restaurant or nightclub, and so lists of this form tend to vary hugely. The two surveys most often cited, both taken in 2007, are by the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) and CAMRA.\n\nAccording to BBPA, the most common names are:\n\n\nand according to CAMRA they are:\n\n\nA more current listing can be found on the Pubs Galore site, updated daily as pubs open/close and change names. As of January 30, 2018, the top 10 were:\n\nThe number of each is given in brackets.\n\nThe pubs with the shortest and longest names in Britain are both in Stalybridge: \"Q\" and \"The Old Thirteenth Cheshire Astley Volunteer Rifleman Corps Inn\". The longest name of a London pub, \"I am the Only Running Footman\", was used as the title of a mystery novel by Martha Grimes.\n\nThere is a \"pub with no name\" in Southover Street, Brighton.\n\n\"The Case is Altered\", an early comedy by Ben Jonson, gives its name to several pubs.\n\nThe Salley Pussey's Inn at Royal Wootton Bassett is said to have been named after Sarah Purse, whose family owned The Wheatsheaf pub in the 19th century. In the 1970s the name was changed to the Salley Pussey's.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19151214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19151214", "title": "Stage hypnosis", "text": "Stage hypnosis\n\nStage hypnosis is hypnosis performed in front of an audience for the purposes of entertainment, usually in a theatre or club. A modern stage hypnosis performance typically delivers a comedic show rather than simply a demonstration to impress an audience with powers of persuasion. Apparent effects of amnesia, mood altering and hallucination may be demonstrated in a normal presentation. Stage hypnosis performances often encourage audience members to look further into the benefits of hypnotism.\n\nThe causes of behaviour exhibited by volunteers in stage hypnosis shows is an area of dispute. Some claim it illustrates altered states of consciousness (i.e., \"hypnotic trance\"). Others maintain that it can be explained by a combination of psychological factors observed in group settings such as disorientation, compliance, peer pressure, and ordinary suggestion. Others yet allege that deception plays a part.\n\nStage hypnosis evolved out of much older shows conducted by Mesmerists and other performers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Scottish surgeon James Braid developed his technique of hypnosis after witnessing a stage performance by the travelling Swiss magnetic demonstrator Charles Lafontaine (1803–1892) in November 1841.\n\nBraid was well aware of similar performances by \"electro-biologists\" in his day; e.g., Braid published the contents of an advertising hand-bill for an \"electro-biology\" performance by a visiting American, George W. Stone, on 12 March 1851, which, as well as clearly emphasising that Stone was claiming to use volunteers from the audience, rather than his own stooges/assistants, details some of the phenomena that Stone's audience might have expected to have displayed to them.\nPersons in a perfectly wakeful state, of well-known character and standing in society, who come forward voluntarily from among the audience, will be experimented upon. They will be deprived of the power of speech, hearing, sight. Their voluntary motions will be completely controlled, so that, they can neither rise up nor sit down, except at the will of the operator; their memory will be taken away, so that they will forget their own name and that of their most intimate friends; they will be made to stammer, and to feel pain in any part of their body at the option of the operator – a walking stick will be made to appear a snake, the taste of water will be changed to vinegar, honey, coffee, milk, brandy, wormwood, lemonade, etc., etc., etc. These extraordinary experiments are really and truly performed without the aid of trick, collusion, or deception, in the slightest possible degree.\nThese are identical to many of the demonstrations which became central to subsequent \"stage hypnosis\", in fact it seems that little changes except the name and the introduction of the hypnotic induction, etc. Likewise, the novelist Mark Twain similarly recounts a Mesmeric performance which clearly resembles 20th century stage hypnosis, in his autobiography.\n\nThe absence of any reference to \"hypnotism\" in these early performances, indeed before the term was coined, and the fact that they often lacked anything resembling a modern hypnotic induction is consistent with the skeptical view, that stage hypnosis is primarily the result of ordinary suggestion rather than hypnotic trance. Indeed, early performers often claimed that they were influencing their subjects by means of telepathy and other supernatural powers.\n\nOthers, however, were delivering performances that displayed the wide range of hypnotic manifestations to their audiences. In the United States, for example, in the 1890s, there was a small group of highly skilled stage hypnotists, all whom were managed by Thomas F. Adkin, who toured country-wide, playing to packed houses. Adkin's group included Sylvain A. Lee,\nMr. and Mrs. Herbert L. Flint, and Professor Xenophon LaMotte Sage.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, despite adopting the term \"hypnotism\", stage hypnotists continued to explain their performances to audiences by reference to supernatural powers and animal magnetism. Ormond McGill, e.g., in his Encyclopedia of the subject wrote in 1996 that:\nSome have called this powerful transmission of thought from one person to another \"thought projection\". The mental energy used appears to be of two types: magnetic energy ... generated within the body and telepathic energy generated within the mind. ... The two work together as a unit in applying Power Hypnosis. The operation of the two energies in combination is what Mesmer referred to as \"animal magnetism\".\nHowever, this is not what Braid meant by \"hypnotism\", a term coined in opposition to theories of Mesmerism, to stress the fact that the results were due to ordinary psychological and physiological processes, such as suggestion and focused attention, rather than telepathy or animal magnetism. Indeed, after meeting with Mr. Stone, experimenting with his own subjects, and presenting his findings on such performances to the Royal Institution, Braid concludes,\nThere is, therefore, both positive and negative proof in favour of my mental and suggestive theory, and in opposition to the magnetic, occult, or electric theories of the Mesmerists and electro-biologists. My theory, moreover, has this additional recommendation, that it is level to our comprehension, and adequate to account for all which is demonstrably true, without offering any violence to reason and common sense, or being at variance with generally admitted physiological and psychological principles.\nHowever, modern stage performers often continue to misuse the word \"hypnosis\" in describing their shows and encourage misconceptions about hypnotism by confusing it with Mesmerism for dramatic effect.\n\nMesmeric and other stage performances changed their names to \"stage hypnotist\" in the 19th century. They had originally claimed to produce the same effects by means of telepathy and animal magnetism, and only later began to explain their shows in terms of hypnotic trance and suggestion. Hence, many of the precursors of stage hypnosis did not employ hypnotic induction techniques. Moreover, several modern stage performers have themselves published criticisms which suggest that stage hypnosis is largely the result of sleight of hand, ordinary suggestion, and social compliance, etc., rather than hypnotic trance. Most notably, the well-known American magician and performer, Kreskin, has frequently carried out typical stage hypnosis demonstrations without using any hypnotic induction. After working as a stage hypnotist and magician for nearly two decades, Kreskin became a skeptic and a whistleblower from within the stage hypnosis field.\nFor nineteen years I had believed in ... the sleeplike \"hypnotic trance,\" practicing it constantly. Though I had nagging doubts at times, I wanted to believe in it. There was an overpowering mystique about putting someone to sleep, something that set me and all other \"hypnotists\" apart. We were marvellous Svengalis or Dr. Mesmers, engaged in a supernatural practice of sorts. Then it all collapsed. For me anyway.\nAfter experimenting with his own subjects for several years until he was satisfied he could perform \"stage hypnosis\" without any hypnotic induction or trance, he concluded, \"The battle of semantics may be waged for years, but I firmly believe that what is termed 'hypnosis' is, again, a completely normal, not abnormal, response to simple suggestion.\" An outspoken skeptic regarding stage hypnosis, Kreskin not only actively debunked stage hypnotists' claims, but went so far as to offer a substantial monetary reward, $25,000, to anyone who could prove the existence of hypnotic trance. The reward has been unsuccessfully challenged three times. While debunking the \"sleep-trance\" concept, Kreskin, like other skeptics adopting the nonstate position, was keen to emphasise that he felt the value of hypnotic suggestion had been frequently underestimated.\n\nBritish stage hypnotist Alex Tsander has made a rejection of belief in a \"state of hypnosis\" a central feature of his career. Tsander, who was among 39 parties consulted by the UK Home Office during their 1995-96 review of the regulation of performance, whilst continuing to perform, since 1993, also promoted a sceptical, social psychological view in a series of books. In \"The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism\" he stressed a terminological distinction between \"hypnotism\" and \"hypnosis\", stating that \"hypnotism is the art of creating the illusion of hypnosis\". Tsander calls his show \"I Can't Believe It's NOT Hypnosis\", a title since adopted by others. Tsander boldly states in publicity that no participant is ever in a \"state of hypnosis\". He argues, in \"Beyond Hypnosis\", that all activities that use hypnotic protocols, such as in hypnotherapy, are based in the cultural influence of roles and schemas of what it is to be hypnotised, ultimately created and sustained through the impressions made by stage hypnotists, manipulating social psychological factors. As an extreme illustration of this, Tsander has used the example of Milton Erickson. Whilst Erickson objected to stage hypnotism, Tsander argued, in \"Beyond Erickson\" that the therapists reputation largely depended upon live demonstrations and that he was in effect a stage hypnotist. He takes Erickson's own accounts of his demonstrations and explains them in terms of normal, social psychological processes and interactions, requiring no special phenomenon or hypnosis to explain.\n\nDue to stage hypnotists' showmanship, many people believe that hypnosis is a form of mind control. However, the effects of stage hypnosis are probably due to a combination of relatively ordinary social psychological factors such as peer pressure, social compliance, participant selection, ordinary suggestibility, and some amount of physical manipulation, stagecraft, and trickery. The desire to be the centre of attention, having an excuse to violate their own inner fear suppressors and the pressure to please are thought to convince subjects to \"play along\". Books written by stage hypnotists sometimes explicitly describe the use of deception in their acts. For example, Ormond McGill's \"New Encyclopedia of Stage Hypnosis\" describes an entire \"fake hypnosis\" act which depends upon the use of private whispers throughout:\n\n[The hypnotist whispers off-microphone:] \"We are going to have some good laughs on the audience and fool them ... so when I tell you to do some funny things, do exactly as I secretly tell you. Okay? Swell.\" (Then deliberately wink at the spectator in a friendly fashion.)\n\nAccording to experts such as Theodore X. Barber and André Muller Weitzenhoffer, stage hypnosis traditionally employs three fundamental strategies:\n\nThe strategies of deception employed in traditional stage hypnosis can be categorised as follows:\n\nWeitzenhoffer writes:\n\nHaving not only had a chance to watch famous stage hypnotists of the 1940s and 50s such as [Ralph] Slater and Polgar at work but having also had a chance to have fairly extensive personal contact with other stage hypnotists, I believe I can throw some light upon the situation. To begin with, one should be aware that many stage hypnotists use stooges or plants.\nHowever, Alex Tsander argues that use of a stooge has in modern times been for all practical purposes inconceivable because of the frequency of their reappearance in different performances (sometimes repeatedly at the same venue) and the dire consequences of being discovered. A likelihood increased by the Internet, social media and camera-phones in the audience.\n\nWhilst denying the existence of a \"state of hypnosis\", Tsander has since the early 1990s presented \"close up\" sessions in which volunteers sit with him at a table whilst the audience sit or stand adjacent. An audience in close proximity makes the kind of subterfuge mentioned above, such as stage whispers, impossible. For Tsander, coupled with his denying a state of hypnosis, this demonstrates that social psychology and suggestion offer sufficient explanation for all hypnotic effects. Under favourable circumstances neither \"hypnosis\" nor deception is necessary to obtain even the most theatrical behaviour from suitable volunteers.\n\nOn the other hand, those who argue for a substantial \"state\" of hypnosis cite clinical claims (not actually evidenced in any case of stage performance, one hopes) such as the following:\n\n\"...editorial implying most subjects have no will or interest in not following the suggestion of the hypnotist, conveniently omit the primary interest in hypnotism came in the early 1800's before ether and morphine were widely available. Thousands of extremely painful operations were performed through the use of hypnosis. Patients awoke without memory of the surgery and even healed much faster than those who endured the extreme pain without hypnosis. Sigmund Freud was directly responsible for removing hypnosis from psychotherapy because of so many reports that patients also had intuitions about conditions of patients they had never met while in the trance state.\"\n\nSuch arguments originate in the work of James Esdaile at a medical mission in India, recounted in his book of 1847. This was before the concept of \"hypnotism\" (only recently promoted by Braidin 1843) had spread and Esdailes work was still referred to as \"Mesmerism\". Whilst Esdaile claimed his patients felt no pain observers on behalf of an independent commission of enquiry for the Bengal government reported scenes of those undergoing such operations writhing in agony. Regarding more recent claims of painless surgery, Barber, among others, has pointed out that detail in accounts of such surgery admit that patients are, even though not unconscious, rendered stuporous by cocktails of anxiolytics. Moreover, the proportion of patients capable of undergoing such procedures (attaining sufficiently \"deep\" \"hypnosis\") is as small as the percentage of the population who are capable of undergoing surgery with neither chemical nor hypnotic assistance, inviting the suspicion that these groups of \"special\" patients overlap. Moreover, Barber also points out that invariably, cases of hypnotic surgery do use local anaesthetic at the area of incision, whilst internal organs are not capable of registering pain in response to a skilled cut rendering many such operations feasible without general anaesthetic, the role of hypnotic influence being essentially at an emotional or anxiolytic level. Furthermore, far from there being \"thousands\" of such cases of hypno-anaesthesia in surgery it remains sufficiently rare as to warrant the attention of news reports when it occurs. As rare, indeed, as the exceptional individuals able to undergo such surgery.\n\nHowever, none of the foregoing debate about hypnotic procedures in a clinical setting has any bearing upon stage hypnosis.\n\nDue to stage hypnotists' showmanship and their perpetuating the illusion of possessing mysterious abilities, the appearance of a trance state is often interpreted as an \"effect\" of the hypnotist's \"power\". The real power of stage hypnosis comes from the trust the \"hypnotist\" can instill in their subjects. Subjects have to cooperate and be willing to follow instructions and the hypnotist will employ several tests to choose the best subjects. Some people are very trusting, or even looking for an excuse to abdicate their responsibilities and are apparently able to be \"hypnotised\" within seconds, while others take more time to counter their fears.\n\nSuggestion is very powerful and a good hypnotist will know how to deliver suggestions that can create better entertainment for the audience. In his book \"Deeper and Deeper\" by Jonathan Chase, he talks about delivering suggestion, more importantly, The Super Suggestion a phrase he coined in his first published book in 1999:\n\n\"From this moment everything I say to you. Every single thing I say, no matter how silly or stupid it seems will instantly become your reality. Everything I say will instantly become your reality.\"\n\nHe emphasises the use of repetition but warns that when they have accepted the suggestion then everything that the hypnotist says to them after this point will become an irresistible suggestion.\n\nHistorically, stage hypnotists often made claims for hypnotically induced enhancements to volunteer abilities beyond normal limits. One such routine that persists is that of \"The Human Bridge\". The English hypnotist Alex Tsander has made a particular theme of taking this cliché routine, which is still touted by many hypnotists as a uniquely hypnotic \"feat\", and de-bunking it by demonstrating that no hypnosis is required. He does this in studio videos with non-hypnotised volunteers, both models and himself, talking to camera. Whilst emphasising that no weight should ever be placed on a person in that situation (which is specifically forbidden in public UK performances under the Model Conditions) he explains in \"The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism\" how performers elsewhere deceive audiences when doing so. At the Kit Kat club, Berlin, in 2012, whilst appearing as himself, Tsander also performed as \"Erektor The Bridgebuilder\" presenting \"Bridgeward Bound\", an erotic bondage version of the Human Bridge with a female co-performer, that dramatically fore-grounded the fact that the \"feat\" requires no hypnosis, which was neither induced nor pretended.\n\nIn a stage hypnosis situation the \"hypnotist\" chooses their participants carefully. First they give the entire audience a few exercises to perform and plant ideas in their minds, such as:\n\nIt has been alleged that these suggestions are designed to overcome the natural fear of trusting a stranger with the greater fear of becoming an object of ridicule as one who is unintelligent, unsociable, and joyless. However, whilst a self-proclaimed \"sceptic\", British stage hypnotist Alex Tsander argues that a more important reason for such admonitions is to filter out \"pseudo-volunteers\": those who only offer to participate in order to prove that they are as they see it \"too intelligent\" to respond, or who want to show that they can resist becoming hypnotised, with no intention to genuinely cooperate in achieving a positive result. Tsander advises that a hypnotist should state clearly at the outset that \"anyone can resist being hypnotised, so to do so will prove nothing.\"\n\nOut of the crowd the hypnotist will spot people who appear trusting, extroverted and willing to put on a show. The hypnotist starts them off by having them imagine ordinary situations that they have likely encountered, like being cold or hot, hungry or thirsty then gradually builds to giving them a suggestion to do something that is totally out of character, such as tap dancing, singing like Elvis or clucking like a chicken.\n\nThe desire to be the centre of attention, having an excuse to violate their own inner fear suppressors and the pressure to please, plus the expectation of the audience wanting them to provide some entertainment is usually enough to persuade an extrovert to do almost anything. In other words, the participants are persuaded to 'play along'. Yet, whilst this accounts for some situations, it does not accord with those where hecklers, uncooperative audiences and those who wish to \"disprove\" the hypnotist create a set of negative expectations, uncooperative atmosphere and opposition which the performer must use skill to overcome.\n\nIn some countries, there are laws and guidelines regarding stage hypnosis.\n\nIn the UK, the Hypnotism Act 1952 governs the use of hypnosis in public. The original Act was amended in 1976 and again in 2003. In 1996 the government released \"model conditions\" which were refined and revised after consultation with FESH and with medical and academic psychologists. Note that these have no legal force: they are suggested conditions which local authorities may or may not feel appropriate to impose or modify when regulating hypnosis. If stage hypnosis is performed at a public venue a permit (permission) must be acquired from the local authority and the local authority is advised to monitor the performance to ensure that all guidelines are followed. It is illegal to hold any form of stage hypnosis in a public venue (amongst other venues) unless the local authority has issued their consent for this.\n\nIn the accompanying circular announcing the revised model conditions in 1996 it was conceded that, as asserted by skeptical stage hypnotist Alex Tsander during the consultation process:\n\n\"In practice volunteers do not react as if they truly believe that there is, for example, a giant spider behind them or a bomb under their chair.\"\n\nThis was a critical point of distinction and represents a formal recognition of the \"as if\" nature of behaviour in stage hypnotism in contradistinction to claims for its supposed subjective reality.\n\nIn the past, stage hypnosis has been banned in several countries in the world including Denmark and some states in the USA. Most of these countries have revoked these laws or don't enforce them. In Israel, it remains illegal to perform any kind of hypnosis without a license given to doctors, dentists and psychologists.\nIn Belgium, stage hypnosis has been forbidden since 1892; the law was mentioned in 2017 to force the cancellation of a spectacle by Messmer.\n\n"}

Founded in May 2010, the company's debut game was the browser game \"Gunshine.net\", and after its release in 2011, Supercell started developing games for mobile devices. Since then, the company has fully released four mobile games: \"Hay Day\", \"Clash of Clans\", \"Boom Beach\", and \"Clash Royale\", which are freemium games and have been very successful for the company, the first two generating revenue of $2.4 million a day in 2013.\n\nAccel Partners and Index Ventures invested $12 million in the Series A of Supercell in 2011, Atomico led the Series B investment, and in October 2013 it was announced that the Japanese company GungHo Online Entertainment and its parent SoftBank had acquired 51% of the company for a reported $1.51 billion. On 1 June 2015, SoftBank acquired an additional 22.7% stake in Supercell, which brought their total stake to 73.2% of the company and made them the sole external shareholder. In 2016, Supercell reported annual revenues of around €2.11 billion. In three years, the company's revenues have grown a total of 800 percent, from 78.4 million (2012).\n\nOn 21 June 2016, Tencent acquired 84.3% of Supercell with USD 8.6 billion. Japan's SoftBank values Supercell at $10.2 billion.\n\nSupercell is part of the Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank, which owned 73.2% of the company. Ilkka Paananen owns 6% and Mikko Kodisoja 5.4% of the shares. Originally, SoftBank bought 51% of the company together with the game company GungHo for 1.1 billion euros in 2013. In the sale, all Supercell's employees sold the same amount of their shares. One condition for the sale was that the main office would stay in Finland. SoftBank and GungHo founded the Kahon 3 Inc in Finland. The company's articles of incorporation state that the company will remain Finnish. Kahon bought Supercell, and later GungHo sold its shares to SoftBank. In May 2015, SoftBank finally bought the rest of the investors out of the company and increased its shares to 73.2%. At that time the technology magazine VentureBeat estimated the value of Supercell to be 4.9 billion euros. In March 2016, SoftBank owned over 75% of Supercell's shares. On 21 June 2016 Tencent announced a deal to acquire 84.3% of Supercell with USD 8.6 billion. Supercell's main office is located in the former facilities of the Nokia research center in Helsinki's Ruoholahti district.\n\nThe company has offices also in Tokyo, Beijing, San Francisco, and Seoul.\n\nSupercell focuses on the development of free-to-play games that yield profits through the in-game micropayments. The company's objective is to focus on the successful games that stay popular for years. The focus has not been on revenue, but on the principle \"just design something great, something that users love.\" Game development focuses around \"cells\" of five to seven people which start with idea generation and an initial review by CEO Paananen. The team subsequently develops the idea into a game, which the rest of the company's employees get to play-test, followed by play-testing in Canada's iTunes App store; if the Canada reception is good, the next step is global rollout (via iTunes). Supercell has discontinued a total of 14 game projects it did not deem promising enough, successful failures which are celebrated by employees. One of the games that was cancelled well into development was \"Battle Buddies\", which had also been rated well in the test market, but the number of players was still too small. The final decision for cancelling a project is done by the development team themselves.\n\nThe employees of Supercell donated 3.4 million euros to the Finnish New Children's Hospital project. It is presumably the largest charity donation done by company employees in the history of Finland. Supercell has also given donations to the American charity organisation Watsi.\n\nThe company founders Mikko Kodisoja and Ilkka Paananen have founded the ME foundation that supports different kinds of charity projects. In November 2015, the ME foundation donated 2.5 million euros to the Helsinki youth department for the support of young immigrants. Supercell also organised a fundraising that collected old computers and tablets from game companies to donate to poor families with children through the Finnish Tukikummit Foundation, a registered non-profit organisation. Supercell was also the biggest individual investor in the crowdfunding campaign for the Finnish Game Museum in 2015.\n\nBefore founding Supercell, two of the founders Mikko Kodisoja and Ilkka Paananen worked at the mobile game company Sumea. Kodisoja was one of the founders of Sumea in 1999, and Paananen was hired as the company's CEO in 2000. In 2003, Sumea gained 1.2 million euros of profit. In the following year, the American Digital Chocolate bought Sumea and made the company its Finnish headquarters and Paananen the European manager. With the new owner, the business activity increased, but at the same time the business culture took a more problematic direction according to Kodisoja, who was the creative director at the time. He left the company in 2010, and soon after Paananen did so as well.\n\nAt first, Paananen worked at the financier company Lifeline Ventures, but soon wanted to become an entrepreneur himself. He planned to found a game company where executives would not disturb the work of the game developers. Together, Paananen, Kodisoja, Petri Styrman, Lassi Leppinen, Visa Forstén, and Niko Derome who had known each other through work connections, founded Supercell in 2010. The company started its business in a cramped office in the Niittykumpu district of Espoo.\n\nKodisoja and Paananen invested 250,000 euros from their savings from their time at Sumea in the company. In addition, the Finnish funding agency for technology innovation Tekes gave them a loan of 400,000 euros. Lifeline Ventures also became an investor. In the following October, Supercell raised 750,000 euros through seed funding from for example London Venture Partners and Initial Capital. The first game Supercell started to develop was the massive multiplayer online game \"Gunshine\" that could be played on Facebook with a browser or on mobile platforms, and the game's prototype was ready in eight months. After \"Gunshine's\" completion, Accel Partners also invested 8 million euros in the company in May 2011, and shareholder Kevin Comolli became a member of Supercell's board of directors. Accel has also invested in Rovio, among others.\n\nIn November 2011, Supercell abandoned \"Gunshine\" for three reasons: it did not interest players for long enough, it was too difficult to play, and the mobile version did not work as well as the browser version. At best, the game had approximately half a million players. Supercell noticed the company could not catch up to the current leader of Facebook games, the Zynga company, and decided to focus on iPad games. Another Facebook game on development was left unfinished as well. The change of direction did not drive away the investors, but the pressure to succeed became worse, and Paananen had to make more detailed reports of progress for the investors.\n\nThe company simultaneously developed five games, and the first one to be released for test market was \"Pets vs Orcs\". This game, as well as another concept, \"Tower\", were abandoned. In May 2012, \"Hay Day\" was published and eventually became Supercell's first internationally released game. \"Hay Day\" was Supercell's version of Zynga's successful Facebook game \"FarmVille\", an easy-to-play farm simulator. Supercell added to their farming simulator the ability to refine products, a production chain, and touch screen properties. The social aspect of the game was emphasised as well. In four months, the game became one of the most profitable games in Apple's App Store in the US, and was one of the most profitable in the world for two and a half years. The game receives regular updates and is maintained by a team of 14 people.\n\nLasse Louhento had started at Bloodhouse, and Lassi Leppinen was the chief programmer at Sumea and Digital Chocolate. Their team had spent months on a fantasy themed Facebook game when Supercell changed strategies. Leppinen and Louhento wanted to make a strategy game that would use a touch screen so playing would be as simple and pleasant as possible. The development of \"Clash of Clans\" took six months, and the game was released on August 2, 2012. In three months, it became the most profitable app in the US. According to App Annie, in the years 2013 and 2014 \"Clash of Clans\" was the most profitable mobile game in the world. The eponymous battle between the clans was added to the game as late as in 2014.\n\nIn summer 2013, Supercell started marketing collaboration with the Japanese GungHo: the companies cross-marketed each other's games in their own games in their own markets. As a result, \"Clash of Clans\" became one of the most downloaded apps in Japan. GungHo's chairman of the board Taizo Son flew to Finland to thank Paananen and later introduced him to his brother Masayoshi Son, the CEO of the SoftBank Corporation. Soon, they proposed a corporate acquisition which indeed happened on October 7th 2013. SoftBank and GungHo bought 51% of Supercell's shares for 1.1 billion euros which is the largest price for a Finnish private company in history. In six months, Supercell's value had tripled, since in spring 2013 the company had sold 16.7% of its shares for 100 million euros.\n\nBoth \"Clash of Clans\" and \"Hay Day\" were released in the summer 2012, and Supercell did not release a new game in almost two years. The designing of the third game \"Boom Beach\" started in the autumn of 2012, and it was released in 2014. The new strategy game was released to the test market at the end of 2013, after which it went through large changes. The game was very successful in the US right after its release in March, but it did not stay at the top of the download charts for very long. However, it rose to the top 30 of the most downloaded iPhone apps after Supercell started an expensive marketing campaign in December 2014. In 2015, the game surpassed \"Hay Day\" in the charts.\n\nIn March 2016, Supercell released its fourth supported game, \"Clash Royale\", which uses similar characters from \"Clash of Clans\". Between the releases of \"Boom Beach\" and \"Clash Royale\", Supercell had discontinued nine game projects, two in their test release phase. One of them was \"Smash Land\" which had been developed by 4 to 5 people for 10 months.\n\nDuring Super Bowl XLIX in February 2015, Supercell spent $9 million for a 60-second runtime in front of 118.5 million viewers. According to \"The Guardian\", the \"Clash of Clans\" advertisement was one of the most popular advertisements of the 61 spots aired on NBC. The commercial, dubbed \"Revenge\", featured Liam Neeson parodying his character from the \"Taken\" film series by seeking revenge in a coffee shop for a random player destroying his village. The commercial has reached a total of 165 million views on the game's official YouTube channel so far, and it was the most watched commercial on YouTube in 2015. Despite the success of the commercial, Supercell has seen only a marginal increase in downloads following the advertisement.\n\nIn 2012, Supercell was awarded as the best Nordic start-up company and chosen as the Finnish game developer of the year. The following year, Supercell won the Finnish Teknologiakasvattaja 2013 (Technology Educator 2013) contest, and the company was chosen as the software entrepreneur of the year. In 2014, the research and consultancy agency T-Media chose Supercell as Finland's most reputable company in their Luottamus&Maine (Trust&Reputation) report.\n"}

{"id": "13513963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13513963", "title": "Television in Colombia", "text": "Television in Colombia\n\nTelevision in Colombia or Colombian television () is a media of Colombia. It is characterized for broadcasting telenovelas, series, game shows and TV news. Until 1998 it was a state monopoly (though there was a short-lived local private channel from 1966 to 1971, known as Teletigre). There are two privately owned TV networks and three state-owned TV networks with national coverage, as well as six regional TV networks and dozens of local TV stations. There are numerous cable TV companies operating in Colombia under each Colombian department statutes. These cable companies also develop their own channels, in addition to a variety of international channels. Television in Colombia has always relied on technological advancements from developed countries importing almost all the equipment.\n\nTelevision in Colombia was inaugurated on 13 June 1954 during the government of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, who became impressed with the new invention during a visit to Nazi Germany as a military attaché. Rojas imported Siemens and DuMont equipment and hired Cuban technicians to set up a TV station in time for the commemoration of Rojas's first year in office. A test broadcast was made 1 May 1954 covering Bogotá and Manizales.\n\nInitially television in Colombia was public, with emphasis on education and cultural topics until, in 1955, the government developed a system of concessions, in which the State was in charge of the television infrastructure and gave programming slots in the channels to private companies known as \"programadoras\". These companies bid for timeslots on the national channel to show their programs. The first of these companies to be founded was Producciones PUNCH, followed quickly by RTI Colombia. In 1963 Inravisión, the public broadcaster, was created. Before that, it was operated by the Televisora Nacional, part of the Radiodifusora Nacional de Colombia. In 1966 the government then tried to privatize the sector, opening bidding for a private license in Bogotá. Caracol, RTI and Punch would bid on the license, but the winner was Consuelo Salgar de Montejo and her Teletigre. Teletigre was a huge success. Mrs. Montejo made an alliance with ABC and brought many of the US shows translated into Spanish to the local viewers. Her programming was so good, that it eclipsed the government owned channel by taking most of the audience. This created envy among many local business men whom felt threatened by an emerging business woman, in a totalitarian male chauvinistic society. The government recognized the power of the media and therefore did not renew the broadcast license for Teletigre. Teletigre would return to state hands and become Tele 9 Corazón and, in 1972 Segunda Cadena, with national coverage. Mrs. Montejo attempted on many occasions to get back in broadcasting TV, but the government controlled monopoly would never give her a slot. \n\nOn 11 December 1979, regular color television broadcasts started in Colombia using the NTSC standard. Colour television had already been introduced in October 1973, when \"programadora\" Cenpro Televisión made a colour broadcast during an education seminar with Japanese-made equipment. The inauguration and the first match of the 1974 FIFA World Cup were broadcast live in colour, but they could be seen in colour only on big screens in Bogotá and Cali. \n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the Colombian national television system had three national networks: Cadena Uno, Cadena Dos and Cadena Tres. The first two worked under the concessions system while the Cadena Tres (later renamed to Señal Colombia) remained under complete government control and focused on cultural and educational programming.\n\nIn 1984, the first of the regional networks in the country was created, Teleantioquia which signed on the next year. Other regional networks, such as Telecaribe and Telepacífico, were created by the then-Minister of Communications Noemí Sanín. In the 1990s Teveandina, Telecafé, and Teleislas would join them.\n1987 saw the introduction of cable television to the country after bidding in 1985. TV Cable began operations at the end of December 1987.\n\nThe 1991 bid (for the 1992-1997 period) triggered competitiveness as a first step toward privatization. Cadena Dos became Canal A, and the programming companies, which numbered 24 at the time, received from that point slots on one channel to compete among each other for ratings. Cadena Uno would be rebranded Canal Uno in January 1998.\n\nThe Colombian Constitution of 1991 and a law in 1995 created the Comisión Nacional de Television (CNTV, \"National Television Commission\"), an autonomous entity in charge of policies for public television and regulation of television contents. The CNTV started working in 1995.\nIn March 1993, more ratings information came to Colombian screens. A court decision forced Inravisión to ban sexual and violent scenes from the \"franja familiar\" (family block). \"Programadoras\" were now required to state if the program was appropriate for minors to view. In addition, \"programadoras\" had to submit their material to Inravisión 72 hours in advance to determine its suitability; television was classified in two types of \"franjas\", including the \"franja infantil\" and \"franja familiar\" (which determined the content rating of the programs to be aired in that block) as well as ratings for the profitability and value of the timeslots, ranging from AAA (prime time) to D (overnight hours).\n\nIn 1997, the government through the CNTV gave away licences to set up privately owned television networks. These licences were granted to \"Cadena radial colombiana\" (Caracol TV) and \"Radio Cadena Nacional\" (RCN TV), which had started as radio networks and were in the hands of the main economic groups of Colombia. Both private stations began functioning as TV networks on 10 July 1998. \n\nThe recession of the Colombian economy during the late 1990s weakened the state-run networks and the \"programadoras\". But the companies that produced the networks' shows also had to face a new landscape of Colombian television, as Caracol and RCN now dominated. Ratings fell steadily as the \"programadoras\" became merely production companies for Caracol or RCN or disappeared outright. Names famous in Colombian television, like PUNCH, Cenpro, Producciones JES (named for its founder Julio E. Sánchez Venegas), the famous Noticiero 24 Horas, and TeVecine, left the public airwaves. Others required financial intervention to stay afloat. The \"programadoras\" had continued working independently and never collaborated to establish a better program service against the newly organized privately owned networks.\n\nBy 2003, Canal A was almost entirely filled with cultural and educational programs produced by the government-run \"programadora\" (Audiovisuales). In 2003, the only production company left on Canal A was transferred to Canal Uno, which left four \"programadoras\" there to receive an equal share of the channel's program slots. Canal A then was turned into the \"Canal Institucional\" and became under total control of the government. Later in 2004, Inravisión would be liquidated and Radio Televisión Nacional de Colombia was created.\n\nIn 2009 a licence for a third national private television network was to be granted by the Colombian government. Spanish groups PRISA and Planeta, and Venezuelan tycoon Gustavo Cisneros were bidding, each of them allied with Colombian shareholders, for the licence. As of November 2017, there is still no third private channel in Colombia.\n\nSatellite and Cable\n\nHDTV-ready television sets (DVB-C) have been available in Colombia since 2003. Ten years later cable companies started to broadcast HD content to their subscribers. Satellite television, like DirecTV Colombia, offer HD channels.\n\nTerrestrial\n\nSeñal Colombia —a state-owned channel— first made digital terrestrial television broadcast tests in 2006, in northwest Bogotá and downtown Cartagena. Transmissions were made in the three DTV formats (ATSC, DVB-T, and ISDB-T). Also the Chinese standard DMB-T/H, was considered, but couldn't be tested.\n\nOn August 28, 2008, Colombia adopted the European digital terrestrial television standard, DVB-T using MPEG4 H.264 and a channel bandwidth of 6 MHz.\n\nOn December 28, 2010, Caracol TV and RCN TV officially started digital broadcasts for Bogotá, Medellín and surrounding areas on channels 14 and 15 UHF using DVB-T h264. Señal Colombia and Canal Institucional started test digital broadcasts earlier in 2010.\n\nOn January 9, 2012 Colombia adopted the latest European digital terrestrial television standard, DVB-T2, using a channel bandwidth of 6 MHz. The reneging on their earlier decision to use DVB-T meant that many early adopters were left with incompatible set top boxes and televisions.\n\nThe transmitters in Bogotá and Medellín transmitted DVB-T2 and DVB-T in parallel (T2 started on 1 August 2012) for three years. DVB-T from these two masts was switched off in August 2015. The TV transmitters in Barranquilla and Cali were the first T2 only enabled transmitters; these started in May 2012. As with Barranquilla and Cali, all other masts will be DVB-T2 only.\nAs of September 2016, there are 22 state owned DVB-T2 masts (RTVC) and 32 private DVB-T2 masts (CCNP: 31, Citytv: 1). RTVC plan to add 16 more DVB-T2 masts in 2017.\n\n"}

It first aired on February 15, 2015, as part of the second episode of the series' second season. During the eighteen-minute segment, comedian John Oliver discusses tobacco industry trends and practices.\n\nToward the end of the segment, Oliver introduces Jeff the Diseased Lung, a mascot he created for the American global cigarette and tobacco company Philip Morris International, the makers of Marlboro cigarettes. The anthropomorphic diseased lung, who smokes and coughs, has been compared to Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man. Oliver and his team promoted the cartoon character by sending shirts with Jeff's image to Togo and displaying billboards in Uruguay, and by encouraging use of the hashtag #JeffWeCan, which trended on Twitter following the broadcast.\n\nAfter the segment, Philip Morris issued a response that received some criticism. The \"Tobacco\" segment received widespread media coverage, with several outlets praising Oliver's ability to launch successful marketing campaigns and change perceptions about smoking through the creation of the mascot. The Jeff caricature was later used at a May 2015 protest organized by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in New York City.\n\n\"Tobacco\", an eighteen-minute segment about the tobacco industry, was delivered by John Oliver on February 15, 2015, during the second episode of \"Last Week Tonight\" second season. Oliver introduces the topic of tobacco smoking by showing video clips of \"trusted newsmen, cartoon characters, and cowboys in TV commercials\" who are smoking cigarettes. He says that the cowboy in the clip is Marlboro Man, a figure used in advertising campaigns for Marlboro cigarettes, and notes that four of the actors portraying Marlboro Man have died from lung cancer or smoking-related illnesses. Oliver says that cigarette smoking is no longer as prevalent in the United States because of, among other things, mandatory warnings on all cigarette boxes and a ban on TV advertisements for cigarettes. The comedian says that tobacco executives adamantly refused to acknowledge the potential drawbacks to smoking, despite strong evidence to prove these drawbacks. He shows a video of Joseph Cullman, the former CEO of the tobacco company Philip Morris International (PMI), saying that \"some women would prefer having smaller babies\" in response to a reporter's comment that pregnant women who smoke will give birth to smaller babies as a result. Even so, the restrictions on smoking advertisements contributed to a decline in smoking rates among American adults, as only 18% of adults smoked in 2014, compared to 43% of adults in 1965.\n\nOliver then shows a clip of a tobacco farmer saying, \"This is the best time ever to be a tobacco farmer.\" The comedian says that while American smoking rates have gone down, smoking rates in the rest of the world have gone up. He displays a viral video of a chain smoking baby in Indonesia who reportedly threw tantrums when he did not get to smoke. Oliver then states that the baby's favorite brand of cigarettes is owned by PMI, one of the tobacco companies that has \"flocked\" Indonesia and contributed to its smoking epidemic. He cites the World Health Organization's report on the prevalence of tobacco consumption, which stated that 67% of Indonesian males smoked in 2013. and shows an ABC News video of Indonesian schoolboys lighting cigarettes at a kiosk outside their school. He also says that PMI, by its own count, sells \"seven of the world's top 15 international brands\" of tobacco, including Marlboro.\n\nAfterward, Oliver tells his viewers about tobacco companies' worldwide actions to \"attack laws intended to protect public health\". One of these laws was in Australia, where the federal government replaced all branding on tobacco boxes with \"plain packaging\" photographs that showed the effects of smoking, including \"the toe tag on the corpse, the cancerous mouth, the nightmarish eyeball, [and] the diseased lung\". He references the Department of Health, which states that smoking consumption had declined to historically low levels after the law was passed. Following the passage of this legislation, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco unsuccessfully sued the Australian federal government in the High Court of Australia and, in the process, were forced to pay the government's legal fees. PMI then transferred the ownership of its Australian division to one of its other businesses located in Hong Kong, taking advantage of a treaty that prevented Australia from seizing the property of businesses located in Hong Kong. PMI Hong Kong then sued Australia's government in international court, claiming that Australia was stealing the brands on its boxes by adding the photographs of the effects of smoking. (PMI would lose this lawsuit as well in July 2017.)\n\nOliver says that Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic had also filed complaints with the World Trade Organization over Australia's tobacco-box law. He points out that according to Ukrainian MP Lesya Orobets, Ukraine and Australia did not trade any tobacco products with each other, so Ukraine's complaint was unwarranted. The comedian says that according to Bloomberg.com, these nations' complaints to the WTO have been funded by PMI, British American, and other tobacco companies.\n\nOliver next describes tobacco companies' lawsuits against smaller nations. He says that PMI has sued Uruguay for including obligatory health warnings on tobacco boxes, and that Uruguay's legal fees had become so costly that the billionaire Michael Bloomberg donated $500,000 to help pay these fees. According to the International Tobacco Control Project, the law helped reduce smoking rates between 2006 and 2012, and the rate of smokers who supported federal regulation of smoking had also risen. Additionally, PMI had also sued Togo, which had mandated that each tobacco box sold in the country contain health warnings written in French, a language many of the nations' residents did not read. Oliver compares PMI's US$80 billion revenue in 2013 to Togo's $4.3 billion GDP during the same year. He then reads a cease-and-desist letter from PMI to the Togolese government and says that PMI had cherry-picked a quote from the one dissenting judge in the Australia lawsuit who had ruled in favor of the tobacco industry. The comedian states that British American and its affiliates had sent similar letters to the governments of Namibia and the Solomon Islands.\n\nToward the end of the segment, Oliver offers the mascot Jeff the Diseased Lung for Philip Morris International's use, free of charge. Jeff, whose full name \"Jeff the Diseased Lung in a Cowboy Hat\", is a fictional anthropomorphic cartoon character who smokes and coughs. He has been compared to the Marlboro Man and described as Oliver's version of Joe Camel.\n\nJeff has been described as a \"cartoon-like, diseased lung cowboy created by crossing the diseased lung pictured on cigarette packs in Australia with the Marlboro Man\". Similarly, \"Rolling Stone\" Daniel Kreps said Jeff helps to \"bridge the gap between the Marlboro Man ... and a 'lung that looks like you're breathing through baked ziti'\". Alicia Lu of \"Bustle\" wrote: Sure, he may be an anthropomorphic lung that's decaying from being exposed to years of cigarette smoke, which might not be Big Tobacco's first choice for branding, but he's a \"cowboy\". Look at his regal cowboy hat, his spiffy red cowboy boots, and the way that cigarette nonchalantly dangles from his lips – doesn't Jeff remind you of a figure from days of yore? If you squint, I swear you'll see the Marlboro Man.\n\nOliver and his team promoted the character by sending shirts with his image to Togo and displaying billboards with his likeness in Uruguay. During the segment, Oliver encouraged viewers to use the hashtag \"#JeffWeCan\", which later trended on Twitter. He also called on viewers to upload images of the mascot to Google+ accounts so Jeff would be displayed on Google Images searches for \"Marlboro\". A live version of Jeff appears at the end of the \"Tobacco\" segment. Sarene Leeds of \"The Wall Street Journal\" called Jeff's appearance \"a full-on Disneyland-ish nightmare\" and wrote: \"there is nothing more disturbing – or awesome – that you will see today than the sight of John Oliver dancing around a guy dressed up as a smoking, infected lung surrounded by more than a dozen children\". After the segment, the HBO Shop started selling T-shirts that depicted the mascot.\n\nA performer in a Jeff costume appeared at Kick Butts Day, a protest organized by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and youth advocates, which was held outside Philip Morris' annual shareholders' meeting in New York City on May 6, 2015. The protests featured a flash mob with fifty dancers performing a choreographed dance to a song with the lyrics, \"We don't want your cigarettes. Jeff we can!\" The performance ended with the mascot: \"rolling around on the floor in a coughing fit and loss of breath\". Shana Narula, the campaign's coordinator, said: The whole concept is to use Jeff and the hashtag #JeffWeCan and #StopMarlboro to show that these marketing tactics are not allowed and tobacco is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the world. And the fact is it's the only consumer product that when used as intended, it kills its user. This is very, very unique — no other consumer product does this. Most people think that tobacco is not really an issue in this country anymore and that's completely not true. That's what we want to shed light on today, in a fashion where people will take notice.\n\nBy the morning of February 16, the \"Tobacco\" segment had been viewed more than two million times. The segment received widespread media coverage, with several outlets praising Oliver's ability to launch successful marketing campaigns and \"alter perceptions about smoking\" through the creation of the mascot Jeff. \"Her Campus\"s Kelly Tierney noted the enthusiasm displayed by Oliver's fans during the segment and wrote: While John Oliver simply considers himself a comedian, it is apparent that he is doing much more than comedy. He informs us of real issues we otherwise wouldn't hear or think deeply about, which in and of itself is brilliant, but what really sets him apart is his way of calling his audience to action about these issues. He shows us that there really is something we can do and helps us to see how we can enact change.\n\nMediaPost Communications' \"Marketing Daily\" published an article called \"What Marketers Can Learn from John Oliver\", in which James G. Brooks, Jr. complimented Oliver's ability to encourage audience participation. He wrote, \"Jeff trended worldwide. This kind of reaction is ideal for any marketing campaign.\" Alex Frail of \"The Massachusetts Daily Collegian\" said, \"One of his funnier bits, Jeff the Diseased Lung, took aim at the tobacco industry; landed on cigarette packs throughout Australia and on billboards throughout Uruguay; and delivered t-shirts to Togo. The power to spark a movement like Jeff the Diseased Lung isn't shared by Oliver's contemporaries.\" Jeffrey Wasserman, vice president and director of RAND Health, opined: \"John Oliver's 'Jeff' character is of course a mockery of an iconic figure, the Marlboro Man, whose legacy turned out to be cruelly ironic. As Oliver noted in his show, four former Marlboro men died of smoking-related causes. Let's hope that 'Jeff' going viral causes current and prospective smokers—mainly teens and preteens—to recognize cigarette smoking for what it is: the most deadly habit.\"\n\nIn July 2015, \"Slant Magazine\" Julia Pressman describes the \"Tobacco\" segment in her article \"The British Dude Who Is Winning America's War on Bullshit\", in which she features five ways Oliver \"has owned 2015 thus far\". The website Inverse included the February 15 segment, the second most effective from the show's second season, saying it \"may be the most lasting of the entire year\". Furthermore, the website's Matthew Strauss wrote, \"Jeff shows up when you Google Image-search 'Marlboro'; he's on bus stops in Uruguay; and he's on t-shirts in Togo. Jeff is an icon. Oliver hasn't taken down Big Tobacco, but he sure didn't make them look too good.\" In August, the \"Los Angeles Times\" named Oliver, and costume designer Mikaela Wohl, winners in the \"Costume designer's quietest cry for help\" category for the paper's 2015 Envy Awards, a parody of the annual Emmy Awards. Randee Dawn complimented both for their hard work and humor, but said Wohl's work on \"amazing\" costumes, such as Jeff and Russian Space Sex Gecko, distracted her from using her \"creative energies\" for dressing Oliver.\n\nPhilip Morris International issued a statement which read in part: On February 15, 2015, the 'Last Week Tonight with John Oliver' show dedicated a significant portion of its program to our company [...] \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" is a parody show, known for getting a laugh through exaggeration and presenting partial views in the name of humor. The segment includes many mischaracterizations of our company, including our approach to marketing and regulation, which have been embellished in the spirit of comedic license [...] While we recognize the tobacco industry is an easy target for comedians, we take seriously the responsibility that comes with selling a product that is an adult choice and is harmful to health [...] We support and comply with thousands of regulations worldwide – including advertising restrictions, penalties for selling tobacco products to minors, and substantial health warnings on packaging. We're investing billions into developing and scientifically assessing a portfolio of products that have the potential to be less harmful and that are satisfying so smokers will switch to them. And, like any other company with a responsibility to its business partners, shareholders and employees, we ask only that laws protecting investments, including trademarks, be equally applied to us.\n\nThe statement also provided readers with a \"balanced view\", and facts about the issues raised by Oliver, including the company's marketing practices and \"approach to regulation\". Philip Morris included links to its \"Be Marlboro\" campaign, which is \"aimed at competing for existing adult smoker market share\", reasons why the company is challenging Australia and Uruguay's censorship of their trademarks, and \"facts about smoking prevalence in Australia after the introduction of plain packaging\".\n\nChris Morran of \"Consumerist\" said Philip Morris did a \"really poor job of trying to defend its actions\". He wrote, \"[...] this should be where the very serious folks at Philip Morris go point by point and explain where Oliver exaggerated and embellished, but they don't. It's a classic non-response in which the accused tried to undercut the accuser's argument by claiming he can't possibly be providing the truth.\" He noted that Philip Morris does not deny making legal threats to suppress regulations on cigarette packaging and questions how the company: \"[expects] to be taken seriously when it readily admits that the products it sells are 'harmful to health'\". Furthermore, Chris Morran takes aim at the company's claim that it \"[supports] and [complies] with thousands of regulations worldwide\", writing: [...] the tobacco industry doesn't support these regulations. It only supports the ones it can't fight in a courtroom. Once it loses a battle – or realizes a battle can't be won – then suddenly Big Tobacco, just like every other heavily regulated industry, claims to support and abide by the rules.\n\nFinally, he said of the statement's final sentence: \"That's honestly the best Philip Morris and Big Tobacco can come up with – We've spent a lot of money and have a lot of investors so please don't mess with our packaging because it might cause us to earn smaller profits [...] It's an argument that might be tenable if cigarettes did anything other than poison the people who buy them – or live in the same house with them.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48235", "title": "Vaudeville", "text": "Vaudeville\n\nVaudeville (; ) is a theatrical genre of variety entertainment born in France at the end of the 1700s. A vaudeville is a comedy without psychological or moral intentions, based on a comical situation. It was originally a kind of dramatic composition or light poetry, usually a comedy, interspersed with songs or ballets. It became popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1880s until the early 1930s, but the idea of Vaudeville's theatre changed radically from its French antecedent.\n\nIn some ways analogous to music hall from Victorian Britain, a typical American vaudeville performance was made up of a series of separate, unrelated acts grouped together on a common bill. Types of acts have included popular and classical musicians, singers, dancers, comedians, trained animals, magicians, ventriloquists, strongmen, female and male impersonators, acrobats, illustrated songs, jugglers, one-act plays or scenes from plays, athletes, lecturing celebrities, minstrels, and movies. A vaudeville performer is often referred to as a \"vaudevillian\".\n\nVaudeville developed from many sources, including the concert saloon, minstrelsy, freak shows, dime museums, and literary American burlesque. Called \"the heart of American show business\", vaudeville was one of the most popular types of entertainment in North America for several decades.\n\nThe origin of this term is obscure, but is often explained as being derived from the French expression \"voix de ville\" (\"voice of the city\"). A second speculation is that it comes from the 15th-century songs on satire by poet Olivier Basselin, \"Vaux de Vire\". In his \"Connections\" television series, science historian James Burke argues that the term is a corruption of the French \"Vau de Vire\" (\"Vire River Valley\", in English), an area known for its bawdy drinking songs and where Basselin lived; Jean le Houx circa 1610 collected these works as \"\", which is probably the direct origin of the word. Some, however, preferred the earlier term \"variety\" to what manager Tony Pastor called its \"sissy and Frenchified\" successor. Thus, vaudeville was marketed as \"variety\" well into the 20th century.\n\nWith its first subtle appearances within the early 1860s, vaudeville was not initially a common form of entertainment. The form gradually evolved from the concert saloon and variety hall into its mature form throughout the 1870s and 1880s. This more gentle form was known as \"Polite Vaudeville\".\n\nIn the years before the American Civil War, entertainment existed on a different scale. Certainly, variety theatre existed before 1860 in Europe and elsewhere. In the US, as early as the first decades of the 19th century, theatregoers could enjoy a performance consisting of Shakespeare plays, acrobatics, singing, dancing, and comedy. As the years progressed, people seeking diversified amusement found an increasing number of ways to be entertained. Vaudeville was characterized by traveling companies touring through cities and towns. A handful of circuses regularly toured the country; dime museums appealed to the curious; amusement parks, riverboats, and town halls often featured \"cleaner\" presentations of variety entertainment; compared to saloons, music halls, and burlesque houses, which catered to those with a taste for the \"risqué\". In the 1840s, the minstrel show, another type of variety performance, and \"the first emanation of a pervasive and purely American mass culture\", grew to enormous popularity and formed what Nick Tosches called \"the heart of 19th-century show business\". A significant influence also came from Dutch minstrels and comedians. Medicine shows traveled the countryside offering programs of comedy, music, jugglers, and other novelties along with displays of tonics, salves, and miracle elixirs, while \"Wild West\" shows provided romantic vistas of the disappearing frontier, complete with trick riding, music and drama. Vaudeville incorporated these various itinerant amusements into a stable, institutionalized form centered in America's growing urban hubs.\n\nIn the early 1880s, impresario Tony Pastor, a circus ringmaster turned theatre manager, capitalized on middle class sensibilities and spending power when he began to feature \"polite\" variety programs in several of his New York City theatres. The usual date given for the \"birth\" of vaudeville is October 24, 1881 at New York's Fourteenth Street Theatre, when Pastor famously staged the first bill of self-proclaimed \"clean\" vaudeville in New York City. Hoping to draw a potential audience from female and family-based shopping traffic uptown, Pastor barred the sale of liquor in his theatres, eliminated bawdy material from his shows, and offered gifts of coal and hams to attendees. Pastor's experiment proved successful, and other managers soon followed suit.\n\nB. F. Keith took the next step, starting in Boston, where he built an empire of theatres and brought vaudeville to the US and Canada. Later, E. F. Albee, adoptive grandfather of the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Edward Albee, managed the chain to its greatest success. Circuits such as those managed by Keith-Albee provided vaudeville's greatest economic innovation and the principal source of its industrial strength. They enabled a chain of allied vaudeville houses that remedied the chaos of the single-theatre booking system by contracting acts for regional and national tours. These could easily be lengthened from a few weeks to two years.\n\nAlbee also gave national prominence to vaudeville's trumpeting \"polite\" entertainment, a commitment to entertainment equally inoffensive to men, women and children. Acts that violated this ethos (e.g., those that used words such as \"hell\") were admonished and threatened with expulsion from the week's remaining performances or were canceled altogether. In spite of such threats, performers routinely flouted this censorship, often to the delight of the very audience members whose sensibilities were supposedly endangered. He eventually instituted a set of guidelines to be an audience member at his show, and these were reinforced by the ushers working in the theatre.\n\nThis \"polite entertainment\" also extended to Keith's company members. He went to extreme measures to maintain this level of modesty. Keith even went as far as posting warnings backstage such as this: \"Don't say 'slob' or 'son of a gun' or 'hully gee' on the stage unless you want to be canceled peremptorily ... if you are guilty of uttering anything sacrilegious or even suggestive you will be immediately closed and will never again be allowed in a theatre where Mr. Keith is in authority.\" Along these same lines of discipline, Keith's theatre managers would occasionally send out blue envelopes with orders to omit certain suggestive lines of songs and possible substitutions for those words. If actors chose to ignore these orders or quit, they would get \"a black mark\" on their name and would never again be allowed to work on the Keith Circuit. Thus, actors learned to follow the instructions given them by B. F. Keith for fear of losing their careers forever.\n\nBy the late 1890s, vaudeville had large circuits, houses (small and large) in almost every sizable location, standardized booking, broad pools of skilled acts, and a loyal national following. One of the biggest circuits was Martin Beck's Orpheum Circuit. It incorporated in 1919 and brought together 45 vaudeville theatres in 36 cities throughout the US and Canada and a large interest in two vaudeville circuits. Another major circuit was that of Alexander Pantages. In his heyday, Pantages owned more than 30 vaudeville theatres and controlled, through management contracts, perhaps 60 more in both the US and Canada.\n\nAt its height, vaudeville played across multiple strata of economic class and auditorium size. On the vaudeville circuit, it was said that if an act would succeed in Peoria, Illinois, it would work anywhere. The question \"Will it play in Peoria?\" has now become a metaphor for whether something appeals to the American mainstream public. The three most common levels were the \"small time\" (lower-paying contracts for more frequent performances in rougher, often converted theatres), the \"medium time\" (moderate wages for two performances each day in purpose-built theatres), and the \"big time\" (possible remuneration of several thousand dollars per week in large, urban theatres largely patronized by the middle and upper-middle classes). As performers rose in renown and established regional and national followings, they worked their way into the less arduous working conditions and better pay of the big time. The capital of the big time was New York City's Palace Theatre (or just \"The Palace\" in the slang of vaudevillians), built by Martin Beck in 1913 and operated by Keith. Featuring a bill stocked with inventive novelty acts, national celebrities, and acknowledged masters of vaudeville performance (such as comedian and trick roper Will Rogers), the Palace provided what many vaudevillians considered the apotheosis of remarkable careers. A standard show bill would begin with a sketch, follow with a single (an individual male or female performer); next would be an alley oop (an acrobatic act); then another single, followed by yet another sketch such as a blackface comedy. The acts that followed these for the rest of the show would vary from musicals to jugglers to song-and-dance singles and end with a final extravaganza – either musical or drama – with the full company. These shows would feature such stars as ragtime and jazz pianist Eubie Blake, the famous and magical Harry Houdini, and child star Baby Rose Marie, adds Gilbert. In the \"New-York Tribune\"s article about Vaudeville, it is said that at any given time, Vaudeville was employing over twelve thousand different people throughout its entire industry. Each entertainer would be on the road 42 weeks at a time while working a particular \"Circuit\" – or an individual theatre chain of a major company.\nWhile the neighborhood character of vaudeville attendance had always promoted a tendency to tailor fare to specific audiences, mature vaudeville grew to feature houses and circuits specifically aimed at certain demographic groups. Black patrons, often segregated into the rear of the second gallery in white-oriented theatres, had their own smaller circuits, as did speakers of Italian and Yiddish. (For a brief discussion of Black vaudeville, see Theatre Owners Booking Association.) This foreign addition combined with comedy produced such acts as \"minstrel shows of antebellum America\" and Yiddish theatre. PBS adds that many of these ethnic families joined in on this entertainment business, and for them, this traveling lifestyle was simply a continuation of the adventures that brought them to America. Through these acts, they were able to assimilate themselves into their new home while also bringing bits of their own culture into this new world. White-oriented regional circuits, such as New England's \"Peanut Circuit\", also provided essential training grounds for new artists while allowing established acts to experiment with and polish new material. At its height, vaudeville was rivaled only by churches and public schools among the nation's premiere public gathering places.\n\nAnother slightly different aspect of Vaudeville was an increasing intrigue with the female figure. The previously mentioned ominous idea of \"the blue envelopes\" led to the phrase \"blue\" material, which described the provocative subject matter present in many Vaudeville acts of the time. Many managers even saw this scandalous material as a marketing strategy to attract many different audiences. As stated in Andrew Erdman's book \"Blue Vaudeville\", the Vaudeville stage was even marked with descriptions like, \"a highly sexualized space ... where unclad bodies, provocative dancers, and singers of 'blue' lyrics all vied for attention.\" Such performances highlighted and objectified the female body as a \"sexual delight\", a phenomenon that historians believe emerged in the mid-19th century. But more than that, these historians think that Vaudeville marked a time in which the female body became its own \"sexual spectacle\" more than it ever had before. This sexual image began sprouting everywhere an American went: the shops, a restaurant, the grocery store, etc. The more this image brought in the highest revenue, the more Vaudeville focused on acts involving women. Even acts that were as innocent as a sister act were higher sellers than a good brother act. Consequently, Erdman adds that female Vaudeville performers such as Julie Mackey and Gibson's Bathing Girls began to focus less on talent and more on physical appeal through their figure, tight gowns, and other revealing attire. It eventually came as a surprise to audience members when such beautiful women actually possessed talent in addition to their appealing looks. This element of surprise colored much of the reaction to the female entertainment of this time.\n\nIn addition to vaudeville's prominence as a form of American entertainment, it reflected the newly evolving urban inner city culture and interaction of its operators and audience. Making up a large portion of immigration to the United States in the mid-19th century, Irish Americans interacted with established Americans, with the Irish becoming subject to discrimination due to their ethnic physical and cultural characteristics. The ethnic stereotypes of Irish through their greenhorn depiction alluded to their newly arrived status as immigrant Americans, with the stereotype portrayed in avenues of entertainment.\n\nFollowing the Irish immigration wave, several waves followed in which new immigrants from different backgrounds came in contact with the Irish in America's urban centers. Already settled and being native English speakers, Irish Americans took hold of these advantages and began to assert their positions in the immigrant racial hierarchy based on skin tone and assimilation status, cementing job positions that were previously unavailable to them as recently arrived immigrants. As a result, Irish Americans became prominent in vaudeville entertainment as curators and actors, creating a unique ethnic interplay between Irish American use of self-deprecation as humor and their diverse inner city surroundings.\n\nThe interactions between newly arrived immigrants and settled immigrants within the backdrop of the unknown American urban landscape allowed vaudeville to be utilized as an avenue for expression and understanding. The often hostile immigrant experience in their new country was now used for comic relief on the vaudeville stage, where stereotypes of different ethnic groups were perpetuated. The crude stereotypes that emerged were easily identifiable not only by their distinct ethnic cultural attributes, but how those attributes differed from the mainstream established American culture and identity.\nCoupled with their historical presence on the English stage for comic relief, and as operators and actors of the vaudeville stage, Irish Americans became interpreters of immigrant cultural images in American popular culture. New arrivals found their ethnic group status defined within the immigrant population and in their new country as a whole by the Irish on stage. Unfortunately, the same interactions between ethnic groups within the close living conditions of cities also created racial tensions which were reflected in vaudeville. Conflict between Irish and African Americans saw the promotion of black-face minstrelsy on the stage, purposefully used to place African Americans beneath the Irish in the racial and social urban hierarchy.\n\nAlthough the Irish had a strong Celtic presence in vaudeville and in the promotion of ethnic stereotypes, the ethnic groups that they were characterizing also utilized the same humor. As the Irish donned their ethnic costumes, groups such as the Chinese, Italians, Germans and Jews utilized ethnic caricatures to understand themselves as well as the Irish. The urban diversity within the vaudeville stage and audience also reflected their societal status, with the working class constituting two-thirds of the typical vaudeville audience.\n\nThe ethnic caricatures that now comprised American humor reflected the positive and negative interactions between ethnic groups in America's cities. The caricatures served as a method of understanding different groups and their societal positions within their cities. The use of the greenhorn immigrant for comedic effect showcased how immigrants were viewed as new arrivals, but also what they could aspire to be. In addition to interpreting visual ethnic caricatures, the Irish American ideal of transitioning from the shanty to the lace curtain became a model of economic upward mobility for immigrant groups.\n\nThe continued growth of the lower-priced cinema in the early 1910s dealt the heaviest blow to vaudeville. This was similar to the advent of free broadcast television's diminishing the cultural and economic strength of the cinema. Cinema was first regularly commercially presented in the US in vaudeville halls. The first public showing of movies projected on a screen took place at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in 1896. Lured by greater salaries and less arduous working conditions, many performers and personalities, such as Al Jolson, W. C. Fields, Mae West, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers, Jimmy Durante, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, Edgar Bergen, Fanny Brice, Burns and Allen, and Eddie Cantor, used the prominence gained in live variety performance to vault into the new medium of cinema. In doing so, such performers often exhausted in a few moments of screen time the novelty of an act that might have kept them on tour for several years. Other performers who entered in vaudeville's later years, including Jack Benny, Abbott and Costello, Kate Smith, Cary Grant, Bob Hope, Milton Berle, Judy Garland, Rose Marie, Sammy Davis, Jr., Red Skelton, and The Three Stooges, used vaudeville only as a launching pad for later careers. They left live performance before achieving the national celebrity of earlier vaudeville stars, and found fame in new venues.\n\nThe line between live and filmed performances was blurred by the number of vaudeville entrepreneurs who made more or less successful forays into the movie business. For example, Alexander Pantages quickly realized the importance of motion pictures as a form of entertainment. He incorporated them in his shows as early as 1902. Later, he entered into partnership with the Famous Players-Lasky, a major Hollywood production company and an affiliate of Paramount Pictures.\n\nBy the late 1920s, most vaudeville shows included a healthy selection of cinema. Earlier in the century, many vaudevillians, cognizant of the threat represented by cinema, held out hope that the silent nature of the \"flickering shadow sweethearts\" would preclude their usurpation of the paramount place in the public's affection. With the introduction of talking pictures in 1926, the burgeoning film studios removed what had remained the chief difference in favor of live theatrical performance: spoken dialogue. Historian John Kenrick wrote: Top vaudeville stars filmed their acts for one-time pay-offs, inadvertently helping to speed the death of vaudeville. After all, when \"small time\" theatres could offer \"big time\" performers on screen at a nickel a seat, who could ask audiences to pay higher amounts for less impressive live talent? The RKO studios took over the famed Orpheum vaudeville circuit and swiftly turned it into a chain of full-time movie theatres. The half-century tradition of vaudeville was effectively wiped out within less than four years.\n\nInevitably, managers further trimmed costs by eliminating the last of the live performances. Vaudeville also suffered due to the rise of broadcast radio following the greater availability of inexpensive receiver sets later in the decade. Even the hardiest in the vaudeville industry realized the form was in decline; the perceptive understood the condition to be terminal. The standardized film distribution and talking pictures of the 1930s confirmed the end of vaudeville. By 1930, the vast majority of formerly live theatres had been wired for sound, and none of the major studios were producing silent pictures. For a time, the most luxurious theatres continued to offer live entertainment, but most theatres were forced by the Great Depression to economize.\n\nSome in the industry blamed cinema's drain of talent from the vaudeville circuits for the medium's demise. Others argued that vaudeville had allowed its performances to become too familiar to its famously loyal, now seemingly fickle audiences.\n\nThere was no abrupt end to vaudeville, though the form was clearly sagging by the late 1920s. Joseph Kennedy, Sr. in a hostile buyout, acquired the Keith-Albee-Orpheum Theatres Corporation (KAO), which had more than 700 vaudeville theatres across the United States which had begun showing movies. The shift of New York City's Palace Theatre, vaudeville's epicenter, to an exclusively cinema presentation on November 16, 1932 is often considered to have been the death knell of vaudeville. No single event is more reflective of its gradual withering.\n\nThough talk of its resurrection was heard during the 1930s and later, the demise of the supporting apparatus of the circuits and the higher cost of live performance made any large-scale renewal of vaudeville unrealistic.\n\nThe most striking examples of Gilded Age theatre architecture were commissioned by the big time vaudeville magnates and stood as monuments of their wealth and ambition. Examples of such architecture are the theatres built by impresario Alexander Pantages. Pantages often used architect B. Marcus Priteca (1881–1971), who in turn regularly worked with muralist Anthony Heinsbergen. Priteca devised an exotic, neo-classical style that his employer called \"Pantages Greek\".\n\nThough classic vaudeville reached a zenith of capitalization and sophistication in urban areas dominated by national chains and commodious theatres, small-time vaudeville included countless more intimate and locally controlled houses. Small-time houses were often converted saloons, rough-hewn theatres, or multi-purpose halls, together catering to a wide range of clientele. Many small towns had purpose-built theatres.\n\nSome of the most prominent vaudevillians successfully made the transition to cinema, though others were not as successful. Some performers such as Bert Lahr fashioned careers out of combining live performance with radio and film roles. Many others later appeared in the Catskill resorts that constituted the \"Borscht Belt\".\n\nVaudeville was instrumental in the success of the newer media of film, radio, and television. Comedies of the new era adopted many of the dramatic and musical tropes of classic vaudeville acts. Film comedies of the 1920s through the 1940s used talent from the vaudeville stage and followed a vaudeville aesthetic of variety entertainment, both in Hollywood and in Asia, including China.\n\nThe rich repertoire of the vaudeville tradition was mined for prominent prime-time radio variety shows such as \"The Rudy Vallée Show\". The structure of a single host introducing a series of acts became a popular television style and can be seen consistently in the development of television, from \"The Milton Berle Show\" in 1948 to \"Late Night With David Letterman\" in the 1980s. The multi-act format had renewed success in shows such as \"Your Show of Shows\" with Sid Caesar and \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". Today, performers such as Bill Irwin, a MacArthur Fellow and Tony Award-winning actor, are frequently lauded as \"New Vaudevillians\".\n\nReferences to vaudeville and the use of its distinctive argot continue throughout Western popular culture. Words such as \"flop\" and \"gag\" were terms created from the vaudeville era and have entered the American idiom. Though not credited often, vaudevillian techniques can commonly be witnessed on television and in movies.\n\nIn professional wrestling, there was a noted tag team, based in WWE, called The Vaudevillains.\n\nIn 2018, noted film director Christopher Annino, maker of a new silent feature film, \"Silent Times\", founded Vaudeville Con, a gathering to celebrate the history of vaudeville. The first meeting was held in Pawcatuck, Connecticut.\n\nThe records of the Tivoli Theatre are housed at the State Library of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia, with additional personal papers of vaudevillian performers from the Tivoli Theatre, including extensive costume and set design holdings, held by the Performing Arts Collection, Arts Centre Melbourne.\n\nThe American Vaudeville Museum, one of the largest collection of vaudeville memorabilia, is located at the University of Arizona.\n\nThe Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres in Toronto houses the world's largest collection of vaudeville props and scenery.\n\nThe Benjamin Franklin Keith and Edward F. Albee Collection housed at the University of Iowa includes a large collection of managers' report books recording and commenting on the lineup and quality of the acts each night.\n\n\n"}

Named Đài Truyền hình Việt Nam (Vietnam Television), the network operated until the fall of Saigon.\n\nVTV was established with technical assistance and training from Cuba on 6 September 1970, in Hanoi, as a department of Voice of Vietnam. During the Vietnam War it broadcast intermittently from a mountainous region.\n\nAfter reunification in 1975, the former US-run stations in the south became part of the national network, and broadcasting was extended to the entire country.\n\nColor television was experimented in 1978 and adopted the French SECAM standard and fully implemented in 1986. Vietnam Television became an official name on 30 April 1987. And by 1990, VTV viewers had two national TV channels to choose from as VTV2 was launched and that year switched to PAL.\n\nVTV's regional broadcasting centres are located in Ho Chi Minh City, Huế, Da Nang, Phu Yen, Nha Trang, and Cần Thơ. Programming is relayed nationwide via a network of provincial and municipal television stations. There are transmitters in most outlying areas of the country. By 2003, more than 80% of all urban households owned a television set. The percentage was considerably less in rural areas, but even the most remote village cafe has a TV and video or DVD player.\n\nIn addition, each major city and most of the 51 provinces have their own television stations.\n\nVTV today has the following channels:\n\n\n\nSince 2003, all the above channels are also available via satellite, digital terrestrial and digital cable networks across Vietnam. The VTV itself offers 15 pay TV channels through satellite television and digital cable which are called K+ and VTVCab, respectively, with channels such as Reuters, ESPN, Disney Channel, Discovery Channel, BBC, HBO plus about 40 original channels.\n\nChanges to VTV regional channels were made on January 1, 2016. VTV Huế, VTV Đà Nẵng, and VTV Phú Yên ceased programming and became VTV8, a specific channel for Central and Highland Regions of Vietnam. Both the \"old\" VTV9 (which was only for Ho Chi Minh City and Southeast Vietnam regions) and VTV Cần Thơ 1 (which was only for Cần Thơ City and Hậu Giang Province) merged to form the \"new\" VTV9 for both southeast and southwest of Vietnam, while VTV Cần Thơ 2 was renamed VTV5 Tây Nam Bộ, a bilingual Khmer-Vietnamese channel and the first regional variation of VTV5. \n\nOn October 17 2016, VTV5 Tây Nguyên, a channel for ethnic minorities in Central Highlands of Vietnam and another regional variation of VTV5, was also launched.\n\n\nThere are also other VTV channels on VTVCab, which are not shown here.\n\nVTV has its own film production company, the Vietnam Television Film Centre (formerly Vietnam Television Film Company), or VFC, which makes made-for-television movies and miniseries. However, only about 30% of the entertainment programming shown on VTV is made locally. The rest is imported and dubbed in Vietnamese. Shows include Korean and Chinese serial melodramas, which are the mainstay of nightly programming on VTV3.\n\nAside from news and current affairs programming, VTV1 devotes itself to orchestral concerts, ballets, traditional theatre, ethnic minority culture shows and films.\n\nAlso, on Vietnamese New Year's Eve, VTV broadcasts some programmes and comedy show like Year's Last Afternoon, News Special, Gặp nhau cuối năm, music concerts, and firework shows, until 2 or 1 am.\n\nAs of 2018, VTV has 14 bureaux with stationed staff and correspondents at:\n\n\nVTV4 has been criticised by Vietnamese emigrees who find the channel's one-sided support of the one-party Communist state distressing and offensive.\n\nAccording to Thanh Niên News, on 28 February 2016, VTV admitted that it had used copyrighted content without permission in some of its programs, confirming that the violation has caused its YouTube channel to be blocked. On this day, VTV, was notified by YouTube that the video sharing website had received multiple third-party claims of copyright infringement regarding videos on its official YouTube page. The page was blocked the following morning. VTV then told local press that some of its editors used some footage they found online in their news and current affairs programs without asking permission of the copyright holders. The programs were then uploaded on the YouTube page. The case was exposed after Bui Minh Tuan, 35, reported to Google that VTV had repeatedly used his flycam videos, posted on his YouTube page named Yamaha Trung Ta, without seeking his permission. Tuan, who runs a motorcycle trading company in the central province of Quang Tri, told news website ICTNews he had spent a lot of time and money to produce the aerial videos capturing beautiful scenes across the country. He claimed that over the previous year he had sent many complaints to VTV, the Department of Copyright and the Ministry of Information and Communications to report around 20 copyright violations by VTV, but no response was received. Tuan decided to report the case to Google, the owner of YouTube. Since September he has reportedly filed three complaints. He told ICTNews he is not trying to seek damages and that he wants VTV to respect copyright laws. Tuan said VTV needs to make a public apology to him in a news program and hold a press conference on the matter.\n\n\n"}

In the separate vegetarian contest, the pies were 10 cm (4 in) by 3 cm (1.2 in). In December 2007, in the competition, entries included a competitor's dog, Charlie, who had eaten twenty pies and damaged a further ten the night before the competition, nearly jeopardizing the event.\n\nDave Smyth, a painter from Hindley, won the inaugural contest in 1992, when he ate four pies in three minutes.\n\nDave Williams of Preston, Lancashire.\n\nScott Ormrod of Aspull, Wigan, Greater Manchester, eleven pies in thirty minutes.\n\nAnthony \"The Anaconda\" Danson, a weight trainer from Lancashire, managed to eat seven pies in three minutes, setting a new record.\n\nMatt Dunning (Australian Rugby Union).\n\nAdrian Frost (42) from Wigan who downed his pie in an record breaking 35.86 seconds \n\nFred Wyatt, a sixty one year old warehouse packer won the 2008 Championship, which was broadcast live on the internet by pie per view.\n\nBarry Rigby, a warehouseman won, eating a pie in forty five seconds.\n\nNeil Collier, aged 42, won this contest, with a new World Record of 23.91 seconds.\n\nJames Robinson, aged just 24, won, with a time of 23.49 seconds.

In December 2009, a similar situation arose, with pies being sourced from Adlington.\n\nIn November 2006, more controversy was caused, when the competition was changed (to meet government \"healthy eating\" guidelines) from the number of pies consumed in a given time, to the fastest time to consume a single pie.\n\nIn December 2007, controversy struck again for the third year running, when the competition actually ran out of pies before the competition had finished.\n\nIn December 2014, pies of the wrong size were delivered to the event, while the intended pies were sent to a nearby divorce party. The contestants competed with halved pies, but the results were nullified. The head of the \"World Pie Eating Championship\" went to court on the television show \"Judge Rinder\" because of this, against the pie maker of the wrongly sized pies, but was awarded nothing.\n\nThis very article was featured as evidence in the episode, referred to as \"an online encyclopaedia website\" by Robert Rinder. Last names were removed however, to protect identities and possibly copyright issues.\n\nWiganers are proud to be called pie eaters, but the nickname is not thought to be because of their appetite for the delicacy.
