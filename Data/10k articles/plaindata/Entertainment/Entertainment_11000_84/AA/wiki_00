It was founded in 1999, and released its first game, \"Arx Fatalis\", in 2002. Arkane Studios opened a second studio, Arkane Studios Austin, in Austin, Texas, in July 2006.\n\nRaphaël Colantonio had been part of the French offices of Electronic Arts (EA) during the 1990s, as part of the quality assurance and localisation team for some of Origin Systems' titles including \"System Shock\". In the late 1990s, Colantonio noted there had been a change in EA as with the release of the PlayStation, the company had shown more interest in sports titles and eschewing non-sports titles from companies like Origin. Colantonio left the company, and after a brief time at Infogrames, was able to co-found Arkane in 1999 with financial help from his uncle, with their first goal to make a second sequel to \"\".\n\nWhile Colantonio had support from Paul Neurath, one of the original developers of \"Ultima Underworld\", EA, who owned the rights, would not allow Arkane to make a sequel with their intellectual property unless he accepted some of their provisions. Colantonio refused to accept this and instead had Arkane set out on a game in the spirit of \"Ultima Underworld\", \"Arx Fatalis\". Colantonio had difficulty in getting a publisher; with finances nearly exhausted, they had signed one small publisher who had gone bankrupt within the month, but later secured JoWooD Productions for publication, eventually releasing in 2002. While the game was well received, it was considered a commercial failure.\n\n\"Arx Fatalis\" critical praise gave Arkane the opportunity for them to work with Valve Corporation to develop a new title on their Source engine, and Colantonio opted to make a sequel, \"Arx Fatalis 2\". However, the poor sales of the first game made it difficult to find a publisher; They were approached by Ubisoft and asked to apply the \"Arx Fatalis\" game engine to their \"Might and Magic\". This became \"Dark Messiah of Might and Magic\", released in October 2006. It refined the first-person melee combat of \"Arx Fatalis\" with a lesser emphasis on role-playing elements. During this time, Colantonio moved from France to Austin, Texas leaving the main studio in the hands of his colleagues while he set up Arkane Austin in June 2006.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2007, the company was working in conjunction with Valve Corporation to develop a game in the \"Half-Life\" series called \"Return to Ravenholm\". The project has since been cancelled and its existence has been confirmed by then-Valve Corporation employee Marc Laidlaw. On completion of \"Dark Messiah\", Arkane started development of a new first-person shooter title, \"The Crossing\" using the Source engine. Colantonio described \"The Crossing\" as \"crossplayer\", having principally single-player gameplay but influenced by online multiplayer elements. The title had a budget of around $15 million, which made it difficult to find a publisher that did not include strict rules and requirements in the contract. While Colantonio had finally found one offer that was satisfactory to him, the studio was approached by EA to help work on \"LMNO\", a game it was developing with Steven Spielberg; as EA's offer was more valuable and more stable, Colantonio decided to cancel \"The Crossing\" to focus the studio on \"LMNO\". However, about two years after this, EA opted to cancel \"LMNO\" as well, forcing Arkane to take up assisting roles for a few years. This including developing the multiplayer component of Activision's \"\", and helping with \"design, animation, and art\" for 2K Marin's \"BioShock 2\".\n\nWhile trying to grow the Austin studio, Colantonio met with Harvey Smith, a game developer that he had met earlier in his career and kept in contact with. Colantonio and Smith recognised they had several similar talents and initially felt that the two of them working in the same studio would be too troublesome, but they then considered if they were working on the same game together how their talents would mesh well. They quickly devised a \"ninja pitch\" that set the basis for \"Dishonored\", and worked out how they would share responsibilities at the studio. Smith formally came on board Arkane in 2008.\n\nIn August 2010, the company was acquired by ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks. According to Colantonio, Bethesda's vice-president of development Todd Vaughn had seen Arkane's work in \"Arx Fatalis\" and its sequel, and while Bethesda had been interested in these, they did not react fast enough before Arkane had taken another route. With Arkane's announcement of \"Dishonored\", Vaughn told Arkane that they were interested in publishing a first-person immersive game, and Arkane was the only option they had. Colantonio recognised Bethesda was the best fit for Arkane, considering the similarities between \"Arx Fatalis\" and \"The Elder Scrolls\" games.\n\nThe studio most recently worked on \"Dishonored 2\", a first-person stealth-action game with role-playing elements that was released in November 2016, and received critical acclaim. They also developed \"Prey\", released in May 2017.\n\nIn June 2017, about two months following \"Prey\"s release, Colantonio announced he was stepping down as President of Arkane. He said in a statement: \"It is time for me to step out to spend some time with my son and reflect on what is important to me and my future.\" Smith took over management of the Austin studio, while Colantonio will stay with the Lyon studio to help transition it to new management.\n"}

{"id": "22447967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22447967", "title": "Bel-imperia", "text": "Bel-imperia\n\nBel-imperia is a character in Thomas Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\". She is the daughter of the Duke of Castile, the sister of Lorenzo, and the lover of the dead Don Andrea. Throughout the play, Bel-imperia attempts to avenge the death of Don Andrea. She begins by feigning a relationship with Horatio to \"spite the prince that wrought his end\", then joins forces with Hieronimo to eventually murder Balthazar and complete her revenge mission. However, critics view Bel-imperia in various roles based on her actions throughout the play.\n\nBel-imperia in Thomas Kyd's \"Spanish Tragedy\" has been viewed in numerous ways. As one can see in Richard Madelaines' article on the transgression and its punishment on the modern English stage, one can see Bel-imperia as a sexual temptress. His essay discusses how Bel-imperia breaks free of traditional feminine roles to exact her revenge. Early dialogue in this essay suggests that Bel-imperia exemplifies the ancient feministic model; as she mourns the loss of the Andrea. Her later actions undermine the role of feminine passivity. Madelaines' interpretation focuses on her relationship with Horatio. \"A bold Bel-imperia leading Horatio on (partly by necessity, since her social rank is so much higher than his) and the love talk animated by gesture, in ways that the dialogue makes explicit. Here, and in other scenes of the kind where there is less textual sexual explicitness.\" As we see here, a brave Bel-imperia leads Horatio away, and tells her of her love for him. Madelaines' essay delves into how Bel-imperia uses Horatio to revenge her lost love. She uses her class and beauty to seduce Horatio, in an effort to make Balthazar jealous. Her seduction of Horatio will eventually lead to his brutal execution. \"The would-be lover is stabbed at the height of his sexual ambition; the fruits of desire are wounds, a bloodletting that cools what is overheated, purges what is infected\". Classical women were passive, and they were supposed to helpless. As we know Bel-imperia exacts her revenge, and successfully revenges Andrea. Thus we see that Richard Madelaine views Bel-imperia as a protagonist, because of her active role in the plot.\n\nMichael Henry Levin's view of Bel-imperia as a revenger is similar to Madelaine's. However Levin focuses on Bel-imperia's passion as her driving force, instead of her class and sexual appeal. He believes \"Bel-imperia is as imperious as her brother—she chooses her lovers, woos them, and sleeps with them regardless of their social position—but she reveals a depth of feeling that Lorenzo never shows.\" Levin states that Bel-imperia adds depth to the play with the devotion and passion she ascribes to all activities, whether loving or avenging. \"When she loves, she will not relinquish love (the secret meetings with Andrea, Induction 5–11), and when she avenges, she is dedicated to vengeance with an intensity that refuses to be denied.\" Bel-imperia's dedication to avenge is first hinted at in Act I, Scene II, when she begins the Horatio affair, and \"she finishes with a passion so strong that we are forced to give her the benefit of the doubt.\" Even though she is under surveillance, she still continues to avenge Don Andrea's death by sending the letter to Hieronimo \"immediately, instinctively, without hesitation, doubt, or fear.\" And, she completes her revenge quite successfully; \"[i]t is Bel-imperia who scorns Andrea's slayer… and whose second love prompts the chain of events that enables her to avenge her first.\" Therefore, it is Bel-imperia who drives the plot, assumes the role of revenger, and successfully completes her mission. Even though revenge qualities are typically attributed the male characters, Levin believes that Bel-imperia's revenging techniques create her femininity: \"mercurial and melancholic, amorous, clever, coy, and scornful by turns, she is the eternal female—and her femininity has iron in its soul.\"\n\nIn contrast, Katharine Eisaman Maus portrays Bel-imperia as a victim of the various revenge plots, but also as a character defined by her social class. Due to Lorenzo's Machiavellian revenge plot against Horatio, Bel-imperia \"is forced into a dynastically advantageous wedding to a man she abhors.\" Bel-imperia is further victimized when Lorenzo refuses to acknowledge her loyalty to Don Andrea when forming his Machiavellian revenge plots. Eisaman Maus argues that Lorenzo continues to underestimate Bel-imperia's loyalty and desire for revenge, \"once Bel-imperia is hustled out of the way, Lorenzo assumes they need no longer be feared.\" The male protagonists not only underestimate characteristics inherent to Bel-imperia, but they little trust in her abilities. Maus discuses that Bel-imperia's intelligence and honesty are belittled when Hieronimo does not believe her letter is truthful, and instead of taking immediate action, lets the revenge plots continue to progress. Hieronimo continues to repress Bel-imperia, even as she completes her revenge, by \"violently\" silencing her in his revenge production. Eisaman Maus abandons the victim idea to encompass one of the main ideas of the play: the social class of the characters. Throughout \"The Spanish Tragedy\", Kyd identifies the class differences in the characters and creates class conflict. Bel-imperia, an aristocrat, upholds the class conflict because she wants to avenge the death of Don Andrea, a middle-class man. Despite Bel-imperia's willingness to cross the barriers for love, Eisaman Maus declares that Bel-imperia maintains her aristocratic status with her revenge techniques: \"both her boldness and her calculating use of inferiors are thoroughly aristocratic qualities.\" Despite victimization by the male protagonists, Bel-imperia victimizes those of the lower classes to complete her revenge mission.\n\nLike Eisaman Maus, Steven Justice views Bel-imperia as a victim of the male protagonists, but does not focus on her social class. In his critique of the \"Spanish Tragedy\", he points out that mercy is a word which is not used once throughout the play. Bel-imperia is viewed in Justices' work as much more of a victim. The play begins with the murder of her lover Andrea. She is again seen as a victim when she is left out of Lorenzo's revenge plots. Though we know of her love and loyalty to Andrea, others doubt it. She is forced to marry Balthazar, her lover's murderer by her father, the duke of Castile. Though Justice points out that she isn't seen as particularly weak, just unfortunate. \"Once Horatio is dead Bel-imperia cannot use romance as a form of retaliation. Imprisoned by Lorenzo in her father's house, all she can do is write a letter with her blood to Hieronimo. She has been confined to a role like Andrea's, urging others to act on her behalf.\" He believes this is because she is seen as cold and calculating throughout the plot, in seeking revenge on Balthazar. He also points out how she is spurned by Hieronimo, as he doesn't believer her letter and fails to take immediate action. Bel-imperia becomes the victim yet again, as the justice system fails her. She is forced to taker Balthazar's life, and then her own. Justice believes that Bel-imperia is the ultimate victim, as she loses both of her lovers (Andrea, and Horatio), and eventually her own life.\n\nDuncan Salkeld believes that Bel-imperia is not a victim, but rather the female protagonist who uses sex appeal to tempt the male protagonists into her revenge plot. He, like Levin, believes she is a revenger; however Salkeld believes Bel-imperia's weapon is her sex appeal, not her passion and determination. His views are also supported by Madelaine, as both focus on her use of sexual powers to complete the revenge. Salkeld supports other editors who have focused on \"the foxiness of her character, as though she were a female Machiavel.\" Salkeld cites Act II, Scene IV to further his argument: \"Horatio is mildly surprised yet pleased to discover that Bel-imperia is not only acquainted with the arts of enticement, but can take the initiative too.\" He continues, \"Bel-imperia's lead in these stichomythic courtesies, taking Horatio in her embrace, accords with the eroticism of the metaphor of a vine entwined around an elm.\" However, the audience is well aware that Bel-imperia has no interest in Horatio, and is simply using him to complete her revenge plot because she is still loyal to Don Andrea. After Horatio is murdered, \"her sexual vitality becomes a joke between the Viceroy and Castile\" as they insinuate that Lorenzo is victim to Bel-imperia's powerful allure. When Bel-imperia commits suicide, her various roles as temptress, \"from Andrea's secret mistress and Horatio's Venus, to her role in Hieronimo's tragedy as the 'chaste and resolute' Perseda, lover to Erasto\", terminate abruptly. Yet, \"throughout each of these representations, her sensuality has proved compelling for the male protagonists of the Spanish court.\" Salkeld defines Bel-imperia as a sexual, female temptress who entices the male characters of the play in order to successfully execute her revenge plot.\n\nBel-imperia's role in Thomas Kyd's, \"The Spanish Tragedy\", is important socially as well as politically. Her femininity proves important as well, as a female character has a very different impact on her surrounding events than a male. Both her advantages and disadvantages from being a female are essential in Kyd's revenge tragedy. Some critics have chosen to focus on the disadvantages she has, and present Bel-imperia mainly as a victim. Some of the many other effects that her femininity has are pointed out by Sharon D. Voros in her article, \"Feminine Symbols of Empire in Thomas Kyd and Pedro Calderon: \"The Spanish Tragedy\" and De un Castigo Tres Venganzas.\" Bel-imperia defends the Empire, which is defined by Voros as a political subsystem. Her name is fitting to her role which means \"the beauty of empire or conquest\". She is also a defender of peace and political harmony against the threats it may face, and represents beauty and femininity. Voros says that it is Bel-imperia who gets the actions of the revenge plot started, and her character's presence is essential to the understanding of the play's political concepts.\n\nIn spite of the view that Bel-imperia is the savior of the Empire, Voros state that she can also be seen as \"destructive and dangerous.\" This view differs from that taken by another critics. While Bel-imperia is described by Maus and Justice as a victim, Voros approaches the subject from a different angle. There is a connection between seduction, women, and Bel-imperia in particular that supports the view of this darker purpose that the female role has in the play. In connection to this Voros says, \"The violence directed toward women ends up eliminating the male character.\" This shows how the female role have a deep impact and can completely turn the play around. Voros makes a point about the suppression of feminine discourse. She points out that in order to get the proper and desired revenge, Bel-imperia keeps silent when necessary. There are different ways of interpreting Bel-imperia's silence. While some have claimed that it demeans and victimizes her, it can also be seen as the contrary. Keeping quiet shows that Bel-imperia is not only a self-disciplined character, but also hints of intelligence as she plans and conspires the plot.\n\nVoros concludes that the role of women in revenge plays is complicated, and intertwines multiple factors of society. She claims that Bel-imperia uses her beauty to manipulate those around her, turning the suppressed female role to her own advantage. In contrast, her presence is also associated with the good government and the common good. Throughout the play she shows these qualities on several occasions. One of the most powerful times she does this is at the very end of the play. In the play-within-a-play, Bel-imperia is playing the character Perseda. She bravely stabs herself rather than having to act immoral and ignoble. Since this portion of the play is a reflection of the plot of the entire play, and the stabbing is real, Bel-imperia is not merely playing a character who possesses these qualities. The character she plays is a reflection of herself and Bel-imperia has the same traits that Perseda has, namely courage and faithfulness to her principles.\n\nThe wording and literal effects used in any play clearly impacts how we perceive the play in general. It may also impact how we view the various characters in the play and alter the perception we have of them. An analysis of these effects and methods has been done by Carol McGinnis Kay in, \"Deception Through Words: A Reading of \"The Spanish Tragedy\".\" One of Kay's main focuses is how Bel-imperia's words do not seem to have much credibility. Lorenzo and the Spanish King both agree that Bel-imperia is lying to them, and that she \"does not mean what she says.\" This mistrust in Bel-imperia is interpreted by critics to be demeaning. The impression given by Kay on the other hand, is that Bel-imperia expects and accepts the response she gets. It is part of her plan to be deceiving. Being mistrusted does not pose any major threat to her integrity as her goal is to get the desired revenge, not to acquire external praise and glory.\n\nBel-imperia manipulates the truth on several occasions, one of them being the first scene with Horatio. During this scene she tells Horatio one thing and the audience another, as pointed out by Kay. In this particular scene (Act I, Scene IV) Bel-imperia says, \"She [referring to herself] will be Don Horatio's thankful friend,\" directly to Horatio. Then when Horatio has left she reveals that \"I'll love Horatio…the more to spite the prince.\" Clearly she leads Horatio to believe that their relationship is based on other values than what it actually is to her.\n\nBel-imperia not only lies directly, but also pretends to believe things she does not. Kay claims that there is only a single scene where Bel-imperia communicates genuinely, and that everything else is pretend, lies and hypocrisy. She refers to Bel-imperia as being, \"hidden behind a verbal mask.\" The expression is well fitting to Bel-imperia and her lack of proper communication.\n\n"}

{"id": "26331461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26331461", "title": "Brumm", "text": "Brumm\n\nBrumm is a collectible model company that makes diecast metal automobiles and horse-drawn carriages. It is based in Oltrona di San Mamette, southwest of Lake Como, Italy - about 25 miles northwest of Milan (Johnson 1998, 32–33). Models are almost exclusively produced in 1:43 scale.\n\nVeteran collector and U.S. importer David Sinclair reports that Brumm was started in 1972 by Reno Tattarletti of the family concern that started RIO Models (other sources say it was a brother-in-law of the Tattarlettis; see Levine 2009; Sinclair 1979, p. 389; Sinclair's 1975 and 1978). Rio Models, in turn, had earlier begat Dugu Miniautotoys to produce models for the Turin auto museum.\n\nThe new company was formed with the help of a couple of associates who had already been making miniature horse-drawn carriages (Force 1992, p. 106). Brumm thus started producing miniature vehicles in Oltrona di San Mamette about seven miles from where RIO was located in Cernobbio. Oddly, neither the RIO nor the Dugu connection is discussed in the company history on the official Brumm website.\n\nThe name Brumm was derived from the Italian for 'Brougham' (Force 1992, 106). As quoted from Brumm's official 1995 catalog, with a silly dark drama partly arising from a sloppy translation of Italian into English – \"It was a dark and stormy night...a dense fog screen wound the city of Milan. Nobody dared get out of the house, and in the desert[ed] streets you only heard the squeaking of a black carriage – the Brumm [of] Milan\" (Brumm, 1995).\n\nCarriages then (with horses available), made up the first Brumm line. In 1976, the \"Old Fire\" series followed, and then the Revival series of motorcars. The Old Fire series at first focused on steam fire engines and other fairly well known pre-gas engine vehicles such as Richard Trevithick's 1803 steam carriage. Soon, the line was expanded into a unique set of steam-powered vehicles – something no toy manufacturer had ever done before. This included Cugnot's 1769 steam tractor from France, proposed for pulling military cannon, and later, two fantastical steam cars: one supposedly made by Ferdinand Verbiest in 1681, and another proposed by Newton in 1680 – neither confirmed to have ever been actually constructed. Such novel choices for steam propulsion did not stop with European concoctions; for example Oliver Evans' 'Oruktor Amphibolos' was a steam dredge demonstrated in Philadelphia in 1804 (Sinclair's 1981).\n\nThe Carriage and Old Fire series were produced in detailed plastic very similar to Minialuxe of France or some Cursor Models of Germany. The Revival series of more modern automobiles, however, were produced in zamac – the first of the series being the cute and classic Morgan Sport 3-wheeler with the V-Twin engine hanging off of the front, which no one had ever produced before in miniature.\n\nAnother unique model choice was Henry Ford's 1902 model 999 land speed record car (see Force 1992, pp. 107–110 for models produced up to about 1980). This model caused a legal row with Rio, who had produced their own version of the 999. Thus the two sides of the Tattarletti family fought over whose model was first and more authentic. Sinclair reports that Rio won that battle, thus Brumm perhaps has made fewer of the 999 than Rio (Sinclair 1979, p. 389).\n\nBrumm Models were advertised as \"not toys and unsuitable for children\" – a fact emphasized on the packaging which recommends that models are only suitable for ages \"14 and up\". Most Brumm models, similar to RIO and Dugu, were offered in top up or top down versions and these versions were offered in distinct colors. Unlike RIO, however, Brumm models rarely had opening features which made RIO seem the better value for the price. RIO chassis were better detailed and also, at times, Brumm paint applications could be rather thick.\n\nFor RIO, diecast cars were once a sideline to a tool and die business. In comparison to RIO, however, Brumm produced a larger range of different models from the 1970s forward. It continues as one of the most prolific European collector oriented diecast firms today, though some of its offerings and approach are similar to Vitesse or Eligor which also offer interesting mixes of vintage with newer vehicles. According to a stock sheet from 2003 on the official website, throughout its existence the company had produced over a hundred models consisting of 353 different liveries. By comparison, RIO Models though fewer in number carried a more refined and pristine feel. RIO often surpassed Brumm in creativity, but not in sheer production numbers, Brumm is the leader.\n\nWhile RIO focused on classic as well as newer production cars, Brumm focused on period racing vehicles (Castellarin 2002). Brumm's later models expanded to 1930s to 1950s race cars, accurately copying the real cars, down to varied numbering, striping, and nationalistic color schemes according to driver or to particular race. Early FIATs, Ferraris, and Alfa Romeos were common, but German and British cars also were in the line-up. For example, the 1938 Mercedes W125 Grand Prix no. 15 model accurately portrayed all kinds of intricate details including tiny rear-view mirror, low profile windscreen, suspension detail, authentic looking wire wheels, brown 'leather' hood strap, and disc brakes. This car raced in the United States and the model even portrays the Nazi flag on the rear of the body.\n\nLater, racing Ferraris and Alfa Romeos from the 1970s and 1980s were offered. Examination of company catalogs easily shows that European diecast manufacturers favored the 'patria', so naturally, Italian brands were prevalent in the Brumm line, though British Jaguars, the Vanwall, and Mercedes-Benzes were also represented in miniature. Different liveries were offered for promotional purposes, like Jägermeister racing FIATs, AGIP, Campari rum, or Amaro liqueur vans, or an Olio FIAT 600 multipla. At least some of these offerings Brumm referred to as its \"Serie Commerciale\". Other nationalistic themes were seen in examples such as the Porsche Speedster with Eva Perón markings.\n\nStarting in 1986, an annual series of limited production models was begun and in 1987 the beginning Revival line was discontinued (though still proudly shown in catalogs a decade later. Brumm 1995; Johnson 1998, 33). Pride in the models produced was evident and the traditional Brumm carriage became the company logo for most packaging.\n\nContinuing the quote from the 1995 Brumm catalog, \"Suddenly the indefinite profiles...were lit by blinding lightning and a freezing discharge of thunder awoke the city...a furtive shadow...comes out of the carriage and started narrating the history of automobile thought...a storm of miniature models...the Brumm Tempest.\" Again, the image is dramatically goofy, but the point is valid – especially in comparison with stepfather RIO, Brumm has been industrious indeed (Castellarin 2002). Brumm even announces models sometimes years before they actually appear (Force 1992, 107).\n\nInto the new millennium, Brumm continues with most of its traditional models while occasionally producing a new Ferrari, Lotus or Alfa Romeo, but since about 1990 fewer models have been produced – about one new model annually. A new sales angle appeared when semi-promotional models appeared, such as FIAT 500s with names of European political candidates on their sides (and yes, even one with 'Obama'). Also like RIO, models, often racing vehicles, are often sold in lifelike dioramas (see Autostory collection website).\n\n\n"}

The cumbia villera's characteristic sound was born taking influences from Colombian and Peruvian cumbia, \"cumbia sonidera\" and \"cumbia santafesina\" in the realm of cumbia, and from reggae, ska, Argentine folklore, and electronic music in other music genres. Lastly, the creator of cumbia villera, Pablo Lescano, admitted that his lyrics were influenced by bands from Argentine punk rock like 2 Minutos and Argentine rock rolinga like Viejas Locas. This overview is not definitive, as time went on and the genre evolved, many bands started to explore different sounds, so new fusions were born, like \"cumbia rapera\" with Bajo Palabra (\"«Parole»\") mixing cumbia villera with hip hop, and \"tropipunk\" with Kumbia Queers mixing cumbia villera with punk.\n\nFor its characteristics, cumbia villera has been compared to gangsta rap, reggaeton, punk rock, tango, Argentine foklore, rock rolinga, protest song, raggamuffin, baile funk, outlaw country, and narcocorrido, among other music genres.\n\nCumbia villera was born in the late 1990s, amid an economic and social decline in Argentina. The introduction of neoliberal economics in Argentina in the early '90s gave a quick boost to the nation's economy but progressively marginalized large areas of the society, and by the late '90s, Argentina was in a total and implacable depression. Some of the most affected by this crisis were the worker and lower classes, and among them were the inhabitant and dwellers of the \"villas miseria\" (slums or shantytowns) in Buenos Aires and its metropolitan area, which favoured cumbia and other tropical music genres. However, through the '90s, Argentine cumbia bands such as Grupo Sombras (\"«Group Shadows»\") or Grupo Green didn't touch social issues and in fact their lyrics were limited to themes such as love or partying. It was in this situation that in 1999 the first cumbia villera band was born in the depths of \"Villa La Esperanza\" (\"«Villa The Hope»\"), a slum in San Fernando, Buenos Aires (north side of the Buenos Aires metropolitan area). Pablo Lescano, then keytarist from one of these cumbia bands, named Amar Azul (\"«To Love Blue»\", but a play on words with \"mar azul\", \"blue sea\"), started to pen new songs with more aggressive lyrics but his band rejected them, so he started saving from the royalties of the songs he penned for Amar Azul to buy instruments and equipment for producing an independent record, and created a new group with a different aesthetic, different lyrics and a different sound, Flor de Piedra (\"«Stone Flower»\", a name that also has a double-entendre, meaning roughly \"«hell of a rock»\"). However, Pablo Lescano decided not to play any instrument in the band because he stayed in Amar Azul, and he just limited himself to songwriting, composing and managing. Flor de Piedra released the first cumbia villera's album (\"La Vanda Más Loca\", \"«The Craziest Vand»\") by sending the master to a \"pirate\" broadcaster due to lack of interest in major record companies, and when the song used as the promotional single and first cumbia villera song \"Vos Sos Un Botón\" (\"«You're A Snitch»\") started to dominate the airwaves, the Leader Music label finally was interested in the band.\n\nThe records began to get heavy airplay, and soon the poor, the marginalized and the unemployed identified themselves with the new musical genre, and cumbia villera spread out to other large urban settlements, eventually rising to popularity in all Argentina. By 2000 there were dozens of cumbia villera bands starting, playing and recording their albums, one of these bands was in fact the second created by Pablo Lescano (this time definitely with the role of singer and keytarist), Damas Gratis (\"«Ladies Night»\" but also \"«Ladies For Free»\"), which he created after a motorbike accident that cost him his place in Amar Azul. New bands also went beyond the original foundations of Flor de Piedra and started to explore new sounds and themes, borrowing elements from rock (Los Gedes, \"«The Annoying»\") or classical (Mala Fama, \"«Bad Reputation»\"), and making the lyrics more socially conscious (Guachín, \"«Homie»\") or radically aggressive (Pibes Chorros, \"«Robber Boys»\"). The crisis that exploded in 2001 in Argentina strongly boosted cumbia villera's popularity and symbolized it for the posterity as an icon of an era in the history of Argentina. It was at this point that some of the finest albums in the history of cumbia villera were released, like \"100% Villero\" from Yerba Brava (2001) and \"Sólo Le Pido A Dios\" from Pibes Chorros (2002). The genre and its repercussions were widely discussed in the mainstream media, with debates in major newspapers, magazines, TV shows, and radio shows, and the phenomenon even reached the television with \"Tumberos\" (2002) and the cinema with \"El bonaerense\" (2002) and \"El polaquito\" (2003). Cumbia villera bands even started touring in neighbouring countries, North America and Europe, spreading the genre beyond the boundaries. This \"Argentine invasion\" greatly influenced the peoples from the Latin American countries were the bands toured, and soon there were cumbia villera bands formed in countries like Uruguay (La Clave), Paraguay (Los Rebeldes), Bolivia (Diego Soria), Chile (Buena Huacho), and Mexico (Cumbia Zero), contributing musically to the genre by using the different styles and influences from all the music genres of those nations, and contributing lyrically by using the vocabulary and slang used in the everyday life in their respective countries.\n\nBut trends in Argentine cumbia started to change by 2003, owing to the election of Argentine president Néstor Kirchner and the subsequent improvement in the nation's economy, some new measures in the Argentine music industry that affected the original cumbia villera's theme like pressure from the managers of the bands to quit singing controversial lyrics and censorship from broadcasters and the COMFER that forbade cumbia villera, though at what extent the censorship diminished cumbia villera's predominance or, on the contrary, further invigorated the musical genre, is discussed. The advocacy in the \"villas\" of christian groups (both catholic and evangelical) also contributed. Other causes include changes in cumbia villera's bands like breakups (Guachín), switching singers and/or other members (Yerba Brava) and downfalls in drugs or other addictions (Damas Gratis), and the rise of new cumbia bands that differed in both sound and lyrics and even aesthetics like La Base and El Original that, for the most part, avoided controversial lyrics and instead sang about love, and named their style as \"cumbia base\" or other monikers to avoid the implicancies of being labeled as cumbia villera and subsequently being forbidden to play in venues or receive promotion, due to the censorship of COMFER.\n\nThrough the decade of the 2000s, cumbia villera continued to have a stronghold in the worker and poor communities all over Latin America, with even new bands being formed every year all over Latin America and continuing with the evolution of the genre, along with the usual constant tours around the Americas by the most representative bands like Damas Gratis and Pibes Chorros. As late as 2007, 30% of total sales in the Argentine music industry were still from cumbia villera records. But its predominance and influence in Latin America was somewhat decreased with the rise of reggaeton that started in the mid 2000s, and bachata and \"cumbia wachiturra\" in the 2010s. However, other authors have different opinions, like Pablo Semán, an Argentine sociologist, anthropologist, investigator in the CONICET and professor in the \"Instituto de Altos Estudios Sociales\" and the \"Escuela de Humanidades\" of the Universidad Nacional de San Martín, who also studied the phenomenon of rock \"rolinga\" and the decadence in Argentine culture in the '90s; Pablo Semán argues that cumbia villera is at last being vindicated in the decade of 2010s in circles of culture, philosophy and thought like universities and government secretaries as a genuine representative of speech by the forgotten peoples. The rising promotion in the 2010s of cumbia villera bands by mainstream rock and pop publications like the Rolling Stone of Argentina magazine, the organization of gigs and concerts of cumbia villera in venues were mainstream rock and pop bands use to play, outside the \"circuito de bailantas tropicales\" (the conglomerate of the tropical and cumbia discothèques), and lastly, the close collaboration and financial production of cumbia villera bands by mainstream musicians like Andrés Calamaro, Vicentico and Fidel Nadal, is also a phenomenon of the 2010s decade seen as a sign of good health in the genre. Nevertheless, cumbia villera remains in the memory of the collective imaginary as the most aggressive, the most defiant and the most socially conscious style of cumbia ever made, and one of the last genres made with true social commitment in the music in recent times.\n\nEver since the 1930s there has been a strong migration from the provinces (as well as from neighboring countries like Peru, Paraguay, and Bolivia) to the Greater Buenos Aires area where factory jobs beckoned. Migrants brought along their culture; the musical mix and the dynamic sounds of big-city life eventually gave birth to new styles. Notably, chamamé from Corrientes was cross-pollinated with Andean music and cuarteto from Córdoba province. Peruvian cumbia bands such as Los Mirlos were much in demand in the Buenos Aires suburbs. During the 1970s and 1980s, \"tropical\" was used as a catch-all term for this hybrid.\n\nIn the 1990s, commercial interests started promoting local cumbia numbers such as Amar Azul and Ráfaga with a more sophisticated image and an emphasis on attracting wider audiences. Traditional cumbia lovers looked for \"authentic\" acts, and many bands obliged by settling on a square cumbia beat, and writing lyrics that delved ever deeper into themes of crime and drug abuse. A pioneering act was \"Los Pibes Chorros\" (\"The Thieving Kids\"). Other bands in this vein are \"Yerba Brava\" (\"Tough Weed\", a play on words referring both to yerba mate and marijuana) and \"Damas Gratis\" (\"Ladies' Night\", literally \"Ladies for Free\"), widely acknowledged as the genre's leading act, that was started by Amar Azul's former keyboardist Pablo Lescano after a serious car accident made him reconsider the message he wanted to convey through music.\n\nThe pauperization of vast segments of the population due to the economic slowdown that started in 1998 enlarged the social substrate that sustained the genre. The term \"cumbia villera\" took hold in the media, and many bands were propelled into fame when emerging football stars from the shantytowns, such as Carlos Tevez, proclaimed their allegiance. When his schedule allows, Tevez is lead singer for Piola Vago (loose translation: \"savvy bum\").\n\nCumbia villera may be musically related to other local cumbia scenes such as Mexican cumbia sonidera and chicha from Peru. Reggaeton and hip-hop are less frequent influences.\n\nSome radio and TV shows had incorporated \"cumbia villera\" into their offerings, notably on weekend \"omnibus\" variety shows, where music runs the gamut from folklore to \"tropical\". The more provocative lyrics were seldom broadcast. Some of the bands gained audiences outside of Argentina, notably in Uruguay and Chile. Due to pressure from broadcasters and (allegedly) influence from Evangelical preachers active in the shantytowns, bands with less aggressive lyrics have enjoyed some success.\n\nWhilst traditional cumbia dancing bands often use a full brass section, cumbia villera recordings are often made at the lowest possible expense. As this usually entails the use of synthesizers, Argentine cumbia can be described, like Algerian raï, Romanian manele or Brazilian baile funk, as a \"low-fidelity, high-tech\" genre.\n\n"}

The result of a \"double or nothing\" bet is either the cancellation of a debt \"or\" the doubling of a debt.\n\nIt refers to the potential outcome in a betting situation where the winner risks what has been won for a chance to double their winnings. The loser of the first game decides on a double or nothing. If the loser of the second bet loses, then they owe double. For example, if one owes somebody a bottle of Coke from a bet and then places a \"double or nothing\" bet with the same opponent, they will owe two bottles of Coke if they lose and will owe nothing if they win.\n\n\"Double or Nothing\" may refer to an initial bet being totally cancelled out by a larger wager on a second bet with a chance to win first amount agreed on by both betters. Ex. Player A: Bets 20 dollars and loses first bet to Player B. Player A: Calls \"Double or Nothing\" (IF Player B Accepts) The new bet is in the amount of 40 dollars (20x2). If Player A wins the initial bet will be canceled. Player B either wins double or Player A wins nothing.\n\nIn poker, a double or nothing tournament is a sit'n'go tournament where half of the surviving players get double the buy-in and the eliminated half does not receive any prizes. Double or nothing tournaments are mostly played by ten players (five players win) or six players (three win), although multi-table versions, such as for 20 players, exist. The rake in these tournaments is usually smaller than in standard sit'n'go tournaments. Some poker rooms also offer triple or nothing tournaments, where one third of the playing field gets paid.\n\n"}

{"id": "381800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=381800", "title": "Hollywood North", "text": "Hollywood North\n\nHollywood North is a colloquialism used to describe film production industries and/or film locations north of its namesake, Hollywood, California. The term has been applied principally to the film industry in Canada, specifically Toronto and Vancouver. The level of Canadian production has increased since the ratification of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement in 1988.\n\nThe term \"Hollywood North\" has been used to describe aspects of Vancouver film and television production since the late 1970s, even appearing in the titles of books (i.e. \"Hollywood North: The Feature Film Industry in British Columbia\") and films (\"Hollywood North\"). The title has been claimed for both Vancouver, British Columbia, and Toronto, Ontario\n\nOne of the earliest Hollywood television series to shoot in Toronto was the 1957 production \"Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans\". The city has been associated with the nickname 'Hollywood North' since the late 1970s, due to its role as a production centre for both domestic and international film projects. In 1979 Toronto mayor John Sewell announced that Canada had become the third largest movie production centre after Los Angeles and New York.\n\nThe actors and crew members central database is operated by The Toronto Film Industry Arts & Entertainment Foundation\n\nIn 2002 the year Toronto's Film and Television industry accounted for $1.16 billion towards the city's economy, former Toronto Mayor Mel Lastman proclaimed \"Toronto is Hollywood North\". In 2003 the Toronto Ontario Film Office was established in Los Angeles to promote the benefits of filming in the city of Toronto and the province of Ontario. With the TOFO Ontario is the only Canadian province to have an office in Hollywood. The province of Ontario had 230 film projects with $946 million in production spending in 2010.\n\nOntario ranks as the largest film and television production centre in Canada, and third overall in North America behind California and New York. A decline in BC's domestic production and an increase of $300 million or 31% over the previous year, allowed Ontario to surpass British Columbia for the largest production centre in Canada in 2011. The province recorded $1.26 billion in production activity in 2011, its largest year ever. By 2017, Toronto itself grew to $2 billion.\n\nToronto ranks second as an exporter of television programming in North America and behind only Los Angeles and New York City among North American cities in total industry production, $903.5 million were spent by production companies on 209 major production film and television projects in 2010 in Toronto. In 2011, the film industry contributed $1.13 billion from 244 on location film and television projects to Toronto the largest figure since the year 2002, this increase in revenue over the past years was attributed to a film tax credit offered by the provincial government in 2009. A 47% increase in Hollywood productions in 2011 over 2010 was mostly attributed to this tax credit among others. In 2012 on location film and television production increased again to $1.2 billion generated.\n\nToronto is the home base for Alliance Atlantis, the largest distribution company in Canada, and the 12th largest film and TV distribution company in the world, which distributes films and television across all of North America and parts of Europe. Toronto is also the headquarters of Nelvana, the largest animation company in Canada and one of the largest animation/children's entertainment studios in the world.\n\nPinewood Toronto Studios located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada is Canada's largest film and television production complex, with more than of production space. It contains the largest purpose-built sound stage in North America, capable of accommodating large blockbuster movies. Some have credited the completion of Pinewood Studios along with provincial tax credits as being responsible for the late 2000s/early 2010s surge in in-province Hollywood productions. Due to its ability to handle film productions on a scale not previously possible.\n\nThe Toronto Film and Television Office reported that in 2005 some 200 productions were completed in Toronto: 39 features, and 44 movies made for television, 84 television series, 11 television specials, and 22 MOW's (movies of the week). The Toronto Film and Television Office issued 4,154 location filming permits for 1,258 projects totalling 7,319 days of shooting. Toronto's domestic production industry benefits greatly financially from large treaty coproductions with international partners.\n\nAs with Vancouver, government tax incentives at both the provincial and federal level promote Toronto as a destination for many US film productions. The city is often used as a stand in for New York City and Chicago in film.\n\nIn addition to being a productions centre, Toronto is the home to the Toronto International Film Festival, which is considered by many in the film industry to be second only to Cannes in terms of influence or in instances actually rivaling it. It attracts numerous high-profile actors and film makers from around the globe to premiere their Films in Toronto and is generally considered the tip-off point to which the Oscar races begin.\n\nToronto is home to Canada's Walk of Fame, similar in appearance to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, honouring notable Canadians.\n\nToronto is the headquarters to the majority of Canada's national media outlets including: CBC Television, CTV, Global Television Network, MuchMusic, YTV, and entertainment programs ETalk and \"Entertainment Tonight\". The city is the traditional host for the Gemini Awards, honouring the Canadian television industry.\n\nVancouver has been used as a filmmaking location for over a century, beginning with \"The Cowpuncher's Glove\" and \"The Ship's Husband\", both shot in 1910 by the Edison Manufacturing Company. Isolated by distance from the domestic film production communities in Toronto and Montreal, it became known as \"Hollywood North\" for its role as a production centre for US feature films shot in British Columbia. The provincial government first established a film development office in 1977 to market the province to the Hollywood community. In 2000, BC crossed the billion-dollar mark in production for the first time, and in 2002, 75% of all Canadian foreign productions were based in British Columbia and Ontario. That same year British Columbia led the country in foreign film production receiving 44% of the Canadian total.\n\nBritish Columbia held the ranking of third largest production centre for film and television in North America for years, after Los Angeles and New York City, with over 246 motion picture projects and $1.02 billion on production spending in 2010. However, declining domestic production in the province through 2011 and less competitive tax rates left BC ranked fourth in overall production after Ontario for a few years. However, it recently, it has regained its position as the third largest production center in North America.\n\nNorth Shore Studios - formally Lionsgate Studios - and Vancouver Film Studios are among the two largest special effects stages in Canada. VFS being one of the largest production facility outside of Los Angeles; Bridge Studios, in Burnaby, British Columbia, has one of the largest special effects stages in North America. Mammoth Studios, a subsidiary of North Shore studios holds the largest film stages in the world, their largest at .\n\nThe BC Film Commission reported that in 2005, more than 200 productions were completed in B.C.: 63 feature films, 31 television series, 37 movies-of-the-week, 15 television pilots, 5 miniseries, 20 documentaries, 16 short films and 24 animation projects. In 2006, spending on film and TV production in B.C. was $1.228 billion. The Great Recession of the late 2000s hit the film industry financially on all levels. By March 2008, the British Columbia film industry dramatically recovered with film spending at $1.2 billion, with foreign-film production increasing 146 percent and domestic animation by 79 percent. In total, 86 foreign productions including 40 feature-length films, were completed in 2008. The city is also host to the Vancouver International Film Festival and the Vancouver Film and Television Forum.\n\nOver the last few years, many states and provinces have increased their tax incentives matching and even exceeding the ones offered in British Columbia which has made it more competitive for the province. These states include Georgia (30% based on a minimum investment of $500,000), New Mexico (20% Refundable Tax Credit), and North Carolina (25% Refundable Tax Credit).\n\nVancouver is from Hollywood, a three-hour airplane flight or a 21-hour drive. It is also in the same time zone as Los Angeles. This relative proximity coupled with government subsidies is a major factor in the growth of Vancouver's production industry. Proximity reduces issues over operating hours, accessibility, travel time for principals, access to filmmaking infrastructure, and experience of crews. Another reason why foreign producers choose Vancouver to film is because of the consistent cloud cover as this weather naturally diffuses natural sunlight which makes it easier for technicians to add additional light.\n\n\n\n"}

Darling was shot by an unknown assailant in the second to last strip. The murder stayed unsolved until a 1997 \"Funky Winkerbean\" storyline celebrating that strip's 25th anniversary. Over the course of the storyline, Winkerbean character Les Moore wrote a book on Darling's murder (\"Fallen Star\") and solved the case.

It is an encyclopedic work covering topics such as polity, governance, ethics, economics, astronomy, astrology, rhetoric, veterinary medicine, horticulture, perfumes, food, architecture, sports, painting, poetry and music. The text is a valuable source of socio-cultural information on 11th- and 12th-century India.\n\nThe encyclopedic treatise is structured as five sub-books with a cumulative total of 100 chapters. It is notable for its extensive discussion of arts, particularly music and dance. It is also notable for including chapters on food recipes and festivals, many of which are a part of modern Indian culture.\n\nAnother medieval era Sanskrit text with the title \"Mānasollāsa\" also exists, consisting of devotional praise hymns (\"stotra\"), and it is different from the encyclopedic treatise.\n\nThe title \"Manasollasa\" (मानसोल्लास) is a compound Sanskrit word, consisting of \"manas\" ( मनस्) or \"mind\" and \"ullasa\" (उल्लास) or \"rejoicing, delighting\". It means \"the joy, delighter or entertainer of the mind\". Alternatively, the compound word can be broken as \"manasa\" and \"ullasa\", which mean \"happiness of mind\".\n\nThe work is divided into five sub-books suffixed as Viṁśati (vinshati, विंशति) which means 20 and refers to the 20 chapters in the sub-book. In modern scholarship, it is referred by IAST spellings \"Manasollāsa\", and \"Mānasollāsa\".\n\nIt is also known as the \"Abhilashitartha Chintamani\" () (literally, the precious gem that fulfills wish). This text title is spelled \"Manasollāsa\", and there is another medieval era Indian text with the title, \"Mānasollāsa\" (), written in Stotra (poetry of praise) style related to Dakshinamurti, very different in scope and attributed to Adi Shankara or Suresvara.\n\nThe text was completed in 1129 CE by Someshvara III. He became the king in 1127, was part of the Kalyani Chalukya dynasty, and the third king in this dynasty. The year when he succeeded to the throne is approximate, and some scholars state it to be 1125 CE. The author hailed from the medieval Deccan region consisting of large parts of modern Karnataka, Telangana, western Andhra Pradesh and southern Maharashtra.\n\nEpigraphical evidence suggests that the dynasty made numerous land grants and financial awards to the causes of Shaivism and monastic scholarship. These monasteries in the Indian peninsula became centers of the study of the Vedas and Hindu philosophies such as the Nyaya school. Someshvara III composed this text in the initial years of his kingship.\n\nThe \"Manasollasa\" encyclopedic treatise was written in Sanskrit in Kannada speaking region of India. The encyclopedia is in poetic verse style.\n\nIt is structured into five sub-books and cumulatively contains 100 chapters. The five \"Vinshatis\" (sub-book of 20s) are \"Rājyaprāptikāraṇa\", \"Rājyasya Sthairyakāraṇa\", \"Bhartur Upabhogakāraṇa\", \"Pramoda kāraṇa\" and the \"Krīḍā viṁśati.\" Each chapter deals with a specific topic, ranging from gaining a kingdom, its governance, economics, infrastructure, architecture, medicine, cuisine, ornaments, perfumery and love-games, sports, jewelry, painting, music and dance. A major part of the text is dedicated to music and musical instruments, with 2500 verses dedicated to it.\n\nThe number of \"s\" in this work are:\n\nThe \"Rajyapraptikarana\" sub-book describes the qualifications of a king and ministers, their duties and moral characteristics that enable the king to rule a stable, prosperous kingdom.\n\nThe chapter asserts that the king should be truthful, avoid anger, be virtuous and lead by example. The king, ministers and citizens should, states the \"Manasollasa's\" first sub-book, refrain from injury to others, practice self-restraint and generosity, have faith in gods, feed and support the poor and helpless, and be friendly. The king, according to the text, should honour his ancestors and all guests.\n\nThe second sub-book \"Rajyasya Sthairyakaraṇa Vimshati\" is dedicated to governance and economic matters to help a king retain the kingdom. It describes the ministers and their qualifications, the maintenance, equipment and training of an army with a \"Senapati\" (general) to command the army, the priests and astrologer as advisors to the king, the treasury and methods of taxation.\n\nJ Duncan M Derrett, a professor of Oriental Laws, states that chapter 2.8 of the text discusses three kinds of constitutions and recommends that the king should delegate large responsibilities to their ministers, a system that implied that the kingdom was virtually ruled through the ministers. The \"Manasollasa\" gives a significant role to an astrologer in the council of advisors to the king who would forecast the auspicious time to respond to an attack, which Hartmut Scharfe, a professor of Indo-European Studies, states proved disastrous during Muslim and foreign invasion of the Deccan peninsula.\n\nThe delegated form of governance in the existing or acquired provinces is recommended by the text, with the qualification that the province should be ruled by someone born there. However, all ministers in immediate vicinity of the king must be born in the long established state. The king, states the text, must watch out and act against bureaucrats and officials who torment his subjects. The text cautions that the king should prevent abuse of his subjects from officials, robbers, enemies, king's favorites and his own greed.\n\nThis sub-book also describes types of \"shulka\" (taxation). In the fourth chapter, it explains the tax collected at port of entry on goods that arrive at the border.\n\nThe second sub-book includes chapters on veterinary care of animals such as horses and elephants who served the army. Many veterinary ailments are described, ranging from fever to injury to stomach upsets, and the proper nourishment, care of the animals as well as formulations of medicines are outlined in the verses of chapter 2.6, for example. The text includes the names of over 40 herbs used for recipes of veterinary care.\n\nThe \"Manasollasa\" contains recipes of vegetarian and non-vegetarian cuisines, which according to Mary Ellen Snodgrass, the editor of \"Encyclopedia of Kitchen History\", preceded the cookbook writing history in Europe by a century. While the text is not the first among Indian books to describe fermented foods, it contains a range of cuisines based on fermentation of cereals and flours. Among meat dishes, the text does not include the meat of cow, horse, elephant, parrot, peacock or eggs. It describes cuisines based on pork, venison, goat meat, and fish among others.\n\nThe text asserts that fresh water is \"Amrita\" (nectar) of cuisine, and \"Visha\" (poison) otherwise. Someshvara III recommends fresh water from rains (autumn), springs (summer), rivers and lakes (winter) for daily use, after it has been filtered with a clean cloth. The text recommends boiling the water before use and using the water so in a day. For drinking, if boiling is not possible, the text recommends alternate purification method based on \"Triphala\", and then adding a piece of mango, \"patala\" or \"champaka\" flower or powder of camphor for flavor and delight. The text mentions fresh coconut water and drinks called \"Panakas\".\n\nThe art of preparing wine is described in \"Manasollasa\" from grape and sugarcane, with unusual sources being based on brewing of \"Talimadya\" (palm), \"Narikelasava\" (coconut) and \"Khajurasava\" (date).\n\nThe fourth sub-book of \"Manasollasa\" deals with entertainment such as music, dance, songs and competitive sports. The text covers dance and music in exclusive chapters, dedicating far more verses to these two topics than first two sub-books combined. This may reflect the importance of performance arts in 12th-century India, since Someshvara III's son and successor to the throne king Jagadekamalla II also wrote a famed treatise \"Sangita-chudamani\", literally \"crown jewel of music\".\nThe text describes types of songs and music, instruments and dances along with occasions of their performance. The \"Tripadi\", states the text in chapter 4.16, was performed during harvesting and husking season, the \"Shatpadi\" was performed by folk story tellers, the \"Dhavala\" sung at marriages, while festivals such as Holi were celebrated with \"Mangala\" and \"Caccari\" genre of songs and music. The \"Charya\", asserts the text, were songs of meditation. The text claims \"Gana\" (गान) to be a form of \"popular music\" and that \"Geet\" that is neither fast nor slow, but contains both high and low notes, where the words and musical meter are equally important to be preferred by spiritual teachers.\n\nRhetoric is discussed in chapter 4.17 of \"Manasollasa\". The text dedicates over 450 verses in chapter 4.18 to dance and describes types of dance forms, musical instruments that go with dance performances, and the occasions when dances were celebrated. The text discusses six types of performers, their characteristics and their roles — \"Nata\" (actor), \"Nartaka\" (dancer), \"Nartaki\" (danseuse), \"Vaitalika\" (bard), \"Charana\" (wandering performer) and \"Kollatika\" (acrobat). Their body movements (6 \"Anga\", 8 \"Upanga\" and 6 \"Pratyanga\") are explained with their significance. This discussion is similar to that found in \"Natya Shastra\", a Sanskrit text composed around 1st-century BCE. The text thereafter presents the 21 \"Sthanas\" and 26 \"Charis\" of the dance tradition.\n\nThe discussion on dance movements is compiled by six categories — mimetic (\"natya\"), delicate (\"lasya\"), vigorous (\"tandava\"), acrobatic (\"visama\"), ludicrious (\"vikata\") and graceful (\"laghu\").\n\nThe fourth sub-book also describes sports, such as fishing, dog (greyhound-type) racing, horse racing, elephant racing as well as archery, wrestling and athletics. The text describes some unique team sports, such as a form of Indian polo involving two teams of eight members each.\n\nThe last sub-book of the text discusses recreation through horticulture and the art of creating gardens, painting, perfumery, architecture and the training and breeding of horses, elephants, lavakki (a type of quail), and other wildlife. A chapter is devoted to the royal sport of hunting deer or other wild game. It deals with 35 ways of game hunting of deer, in addition to hunting with dogs, falconry and fishing.\n\nThe garden design, asserts the text, should include rocks and raised mounds of summits, manicured with plants and trees of diverse varieties, artificial ponds and flowing brooks. It describes the arrangement, the soils, the seeds, the distance between types of plants and trees, the methods of preparing manure, proper fertilizing and maintaining the garden, which plants and trees are best planted first, when to plant others, watering, signs of overwatering and underwatering, weeds, means of protecting the garden and other details. Both public parks and woodland gardens are described, with about 40 types of trees recommended for the park in the \"Vana-krida\" chapter.\n\nOther arts and leisure activities described in the fifth sub-book include activities such as garland making and perfumery, wherein the flowers are arranged in patterns of pleasing colors and ones that delight the senses. The text lists types of aromatic woods, such as sandalwood and their qualities. The text describes the art of painting as three types — \"Viddha\" (representational), \"Aviddha\" (sketch, outline) and \"Bhava\" (narrative). The text includes a recipe for making various types of paints, as well as crayons for drawing, and then recommends the steps in making a drawing.\n\nThe 12th-century text describes jewelry and make up of women including those applied to their eyelids, lashes, cheeks and forearms, mentioning styles and colors of \"Tilak\" on their foreheads. In jewelry, those for hair and earrings are notable.\n\nThe \"Manasollasa\" has been called an important source on socio-cultural history of medieval India, particularly for the history of food, drinks and cuisines and of sports. Mandakranta Bose, a professor on South Asian studies, describes the text to be of great interest because it is the earliest known text with details on dance genres in India. A team consisting of Bruno Nettl, a professor of music and anthropology, has called \"Manasollasa\" an enormous treatise with large sections on music, dance and other performance arts.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "270918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=270918", "title": "Martingale (betting system)", "text": "Martingale (betting system)\n\nA martingale is any of a class of betting strategies that originated from and were popular in 18th century France. The simplest of these strategies was designed for a game in which the gambler wins his stake if a coin comes up heads and loses it if the coin comes up tails. The strategy had the gambler double his bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. The martingale strategy has been applied to roulette as well, as the probability of hitting either red or black is close to 50%.\n\nSince a gambler with infinite wealth will, almost surely, eventually flip heads, the martingale betting strategy was seen as a sure thing by those who advocated it. None of the gamblers possessed infinite wealth, and the exponential growth of the bets would eventually bankrupt \"unlucky\" gamblers who chose to use the martingale. The gambler usually wins a small net reward, thus appearing to have a sound strategy. However, the gambler's expected value does indeed remain zero (or less than zero) because the small probability that he will suffer a catastrophic loss exactly balances with his expected gain. (In a casino, the expected value is \"negative\", due to the house's edge.) The likelihood of catastrophic loss may not even be very small. The bet size rises exponentially. This, combined with the fact that strings of consecutive losses actually occur more often than common intuition suggests, can bankrupt a gambler quickly.\n\nThe fundamental reason why all martingale-type betting systems fail is that no amount of information about the results of past bets can be used to predict the results of a future bet with accuracy better than chance. In mathematical terminology, this corresponds to the assumption that the win-loss outcomes of each bet are independent and identically distributed random variables, an assumption which is valid in many realistic situations. It follows from this assumption that the expected value of a series of bets is equal to the sum, over all bets that could potentially occur in the series, of the expected value of a potential bet times the probability that the player will make that bet. In most casino games, the expected value of any individual bet is negative, so the sum of lots of negative numbers is also always going to be negative.\n\nThe martingale strategy fails even with unbounded stopping time, as long as there is a limit on earnings or on the bets (which is also true in practice). It is only with unbounded wealth, bets \"and\" time that it could be argued that the martingale becomes a winning strategy.\n\nThe impossibility of winning over the long run, given a limit of the size of bets or a limit in the size of one's bankroll or line of credit, is proven by the optional stopping theorem.\n\nLet one round be defined as a sequence of consecutive losses followed by either a win, or bankruptcy of the gambler. After a win, the gambler \"resets\" and is considered to have started a new round. A continuous sequence of martingale bets can thus be partitioned into a sequence of independent rounds. Following is an analysis of the expected value of one round.\n\nLet \"q\" be the probability of losing (e.g. for American double-zero roulette, it is 10/19 for a bet on black or red). Let \"B\" be the amount of the initial bet. Let \"n\" be the finite number of bets the gambler can afford to lose.\n\nThe probability that the gambler will lose all \"n\" bets is \"q\". When all bets lose, the total loss is\n\nThe probability the gambler does not lose all \"n\" bets is 1 − \"q\". In all other cases, the gambler wins the initial bet (\"B\".) Thus, the expected profit per round is\n\nWhenever \"q\" > 1/2, the expression 1 − (2\"q\") < 0 for all \"n\" > 0. Thus, for all games where a gambler is more likely to lose than to win any given bet, that gambler is expected to lose money, on average, each round. Increasing the size of wager for each round per the martingale system only serves to increase the average loss.\n\nSuppose a gambler has a 63 unit gambling bankroll. The gambler might bet 1 unit on the first spin. On each loss, the bet is doubled. Thus, taking \"k\" as the number of preceding consecutive losses, the player will always bet 2 units.\n\nWith a win on any given spin, the gambler will net 1 unit over the total amount wagered to that point. Once this win is achieved, the gambler restarts the system with a 1 unit bet.\n\nWith losses on all of the first six spins, the gambler loses a total of 63 units. This exhausts the bankroll and the martingale cannot be continued.\n\nIn this example, the probability of losing the entire bankroll and being unable to continue the martingale is equal to the probability of 6 consecutive losses: (10/19) = 2.1256%. The probability of winning is equal to 1 minus the probability of losing 6 times: 1 − (10/19) = 97.8744%.\n\nThe expected amount won is (1 × 0.978744) = 0.978744.<br>\nThe expected amount lost is (63 × 0.021256)= 1.339118.<br>\nThus, the total expected value for each application of the betting system is (0.978744 − 1.339118) = −0.360374 .\n\nIn a unique circumstance, this strategy can make sense. Suppose the gambler possesses exactly 63 units but desperately needs a total of 64. Assuming \"q\" > 1/2 (it is a real casino) and he may only place bets at even odds, his best strategy is bold play: at each spin, he should bet the smallest amount such that if he wins he reaches his target immediately, and if he doesn't have enough for this, he should simply bet everything. Eventually he either goes bust or reaches his target. This strategy gives him a probability of 97.8744% of achieving the goal of winning one unit vs. a 2.1256% chance of losing all 63 units, and that is the best probability possible in this circumstance. However, bold play is not always the optimal strategy for having the biggest possible chance to increase an initial capital to some desired higher amount. If the gambler can bet arbitrarily small amounts at arbitrarily long odds (but still with the same expected loss of 1/19 of the stake at each bet), and can only place one bet at each spin, then there are strategies with above 98% chance of attaining his goal, and these use very timid play unless the gambler is close to losing all his capital, in which case he does switch to extremely bold play.\n\nThe previous analysis calculates \"expected value\", but we can ask another question: what is the chance that one can play a casino game using the martingale strategy, and avoid the losing streak long enough to double one's bankroll.\n\nAs before, this depends on the likelihood of losing 6 roulette spins in a row assuming we are betting red/black or even/odd. Many gamblers believe that the chances of losing 6 in a row are remote, and that with a patient adherence to the strategy they will slowly increase their bankroll.\n\nIn reality, the odds of a streak of 6 losses in a row are much higher than many people intuitively believe. Psychological studies have shown that since people know that the odds of losing 6 times in a row out of 6 plays are low, they incorrectly assume that in a longer string of plays the odds are also very low. When people are asked to invent data representing 200 coin tosses, they often do not add streaks of more than 5 because they believe that these streaks are very unlikely. This intuitive belief is sometimes referred to as the representativeness heuristic.\n\nThis is also known as the reverse martingale. In a classic martingale betting style, gamblers increase bets after each loss in hopes that an eventual win will recover all previous losses. The anti-martingale approach instead increases bets after wins, while reducing them after a loss. The perception is that the gambler will benefit from a winning streak or a \"hot hand\", while reducing losses while \"cold\" or otherwise having a losing streak. As the single bets are independent from each other (and from the gambler's expectations), the concept of winning \"streaks\" is merely an example of gambler's fallacy, and the anti-martingale strategy fails to make any money. If on the other hand, real-life stock returns are serially correlated (for instance due to economic cycles and delayed reaction to news of larger market participants), \"streaks\" of wins or losses do happen more often and are longer than those under a purely random process, the anti-martingale strategy could theoretically apply and can be used in trading systems (as trend-following or \"doubling up\"). (But see also dollar cost averaging.)\n"}
{"id": "404289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=404289", "title": "Menippean satire", "text": "Menippean satire\n\nThe genre of Menippean satire is a form of satire, usually in prose, which has a length and structure similar to a novel and is characterized by attacking mental attitudes rather than specific individuals or entities. Other features found in Menippean satire are different forms of parody and mythological burlesque, a critique of the myths inherited from traditional culture, a rhapsodic nature, a fragmented narrative, the combination of many different targets, and the rapid moving between styles and points of view.\n\nThe term is used by classical grammarians and by philologists mostly to refer to satires in prose (cf. the verse Satires of Juvenal and his imitators). Typical mental attitudes attacked and ridiculed by Menippean satires are \"pedants, bigots, cranks, parvenus, virtuosi, enthusiasts, rapacious and incompetent professional men of all kinds,\" which are treated as diseases of the intellect. The term \"Menippean satire\" distinguishes it from the earlier satire pioneered by Aristophanes, which was based on personal attacks.\n\nThe form is named after the Greek cynic parodist and polemicist Menippus (third century BC). His works, now lost, influenced the works of Lucian and Marcus Terentius Varro; such satires are sometimes also termed Varronian satire. M. H. Abrams classifies Menippean satire as one form of indirect satire, the category opposed to the formal satire of direct criticism in the first person.\n\nPaul Salzman, taking Menippean satire as a genre as \"rather ill-defined\", describes it as a mixture of allegory, picaresque narrative and satirical commentary. Northrop Frye found the term \"cumbersome and in modern terms rather misleading\", and proposed as replacement the term 'anatomy' (taken from Burton's \"Anatomy of Melancholy\"). In his theory of prose fiction it occupies the fourth place with the novel, romance and confession.\n\nVarro's own 150 books of Menippean satires survive only through quotations. The genre continued with Seneca the Younger, whose \"Apocolocyntosis\", or \"Pumpkinification\", is the only near-complete classical Menippean satire to survive. It consisted in an irreverent parody of the deification of Emperor Claudius. The Menippean tradition is also evident in Petronius' \"Satyricon\", especially in the banquet scene \"Cena Trimalchionis\", which combines epic form, tragedy, and philosophy with verse and prose; and in Apuleius' \"Golden Ass\", the form is combined with the comic novel. Elements of the Menippean satire have also been pointed out in the Gospels.\n\nLater examples include \"The Consolation of Philosophy\" of Boethius and \"The Caesars\" of Julian the apostate.\n\nThe form was revived during the Renaissance by Erasmus, Burton, and Laurence Sterne, while 19th-century examples include the \"John Buncle\" of Thomas Amory and \"The Doctor\" of Robert Southey. The 20th century saw renewed critical interest in the form, with Menippean satire significantly influencing postmodern literature. Contemporary scholars including Frye classify the following works as Menippean satires:\n\nAccording to P. Adams Sitney in \"Visionary Film,\" Mennipea became the dominant new genre in avant-garde cinema at the turn of the century. Filmmakers he cited include Yvonne Rainer, Sidney Peterson, Michael Snow, and Hollis Frampton.\n\nMarshall McLuhan also made extensive use of Menippean satire, as he himself suggested: “Most of my writing is Menippean satire, presenting the actual surface of the world we live in as a ludicrous image.”\n\nMenippean satire plays a special role in Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of the novel. In \"Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics\", Bakhtin treats Menippean satire as one of the classical \"serio-comic\" genres, alongside Socratic dialogue and other forms that Bakhtin claims are united by a \"carnival sense of the world\", wherein \"carnival is the past millennia's way of sensing the world as one great communal performance\" and is \"permeated with the pathos of change and the joyful relativity of all things\". The folk-carnival sense of the world, in which forms like the Socratic dialogue and Menippean satire are based, \"did not permit thought to stop and congeal in one-sided seriousness or in a stupid fetish for definition or singleness of meaning.\" Modern authors of \"Menippea\" in Bakhtin's sense include Voltaire, Diderot, and E.T.A. Hoffmann. For Bakhtin, the novels of Dostoevsky represent the highest point in the development of the genre.\nIn a series of articles, Edward Milowicki and Robert Rawdon Wilson, building upon Bakhtin’s theory, have argued that Menippean is not a period-specific term, as many Classicists have claimed, but a term for discursive analysis that instructively applies to many kinds of writing from many historical periods including the modern. As a type of discourse, “Menippean” signifies a mixed, often discontinuous way of writing that draws upon distinct, multiple traditions. It is normally highly intellectual and typically embodies an idea, an ideology or a mind-set in the figure of a grotesque, even disgusting, comic character. The power of very physical images to satirize, or otherwise comment upon, ideas lies at the heart of Menippean satire.\n\nCritic Northrop Frye said that Menippean satire moves rapidly between styles and points of view. Such satires deal less with human characters than with the single-minded mental attitudes, or \"humours\", that they represent: the pedant, the braggart, the bigot, the miser, the quack, the seducer, etc. Frye observed,\n\nHe illustrated this distinction by positing Squire Western (from \"Tom Jones\") as a character rooted in novelistic realism, but the tutors Thwackum and Square as figures of Menippean satire.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53827366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53827366", "title": "Ngesti Pandawa", "text": "Ngesti Pandawa\n\nNgesti Pandawa is a professional wayang wong or wayang orang art company located in Semarang. The Ngesti Pandawa wayang orang is housed in the Ki Narto Sabdho Hall in Taman Budaya Raden Saleh or the Taman Raden Saleh Cultural Complex at Jalan Sriwijaya 29, Semarang City, Central Java Province, Indonesia. Ngesti Pandawa is one of three surviving wayang orang troupes in Indonesia, besides Wayang Orang Sriwedari in Taman Sriwedari Solo and Wayang Orang Bharata in Jakarta. It is hoped that wayang orang will again be able to entertain generations of audiences while sending a timeless moral message.\n\nNgesti Pandawa was founded in Madiun by Sastro Sabdo on July 1, 1937 with the aim of reviving the art of wayang orang panggung, wayang plays performed by human actors on a proscenium stage. Wayang orang panggung is a blend of court wayang orang (which was also called pendhapa wayang orang because it was performed in the pendhapa [the spacious open hall of Javanese stately mansions] instead on a stage) with western theater. The first wayang orang panggung troupe was first established in 1895 by Gan Kan, a Chinese entrepreneur from Surakarta (Solo).a The founding of wayang orang Ngesti Pandawa was intended to preserve the art of wayang orang, and inspire a sense of love in traditional arts. The wayang orang performances also provide entertainment to the public. Sastro Sabdo's mission was supported by Sastro Sudirdjo, Narto Sabdo, Darso Sabdo, and Kusni.\n\nSince its founding, wayang orang Ngesti Pandawa has been much liked by the public. Not only by the Javanese but also by the Dutch and Chinese population. Wayang orang, from its early beginning, was a performing art that was enjoyed by a diverse audience, indigenous and non-indigenous.\n\nNgesti Pandawa has gone through a long historical journey in the city of Semarang. During that time, Ngesti Pandawa has had to move several times. In 1954, Ngesti Pandawa occupied a new building in the Gedung Rakyat Indonesia Semarang (GRIS) building complex at Jalan Pemuda 116 (currently Paragon City Mall Semarang). From the 1960s to the 1970s, under the leadership of Sastro Sabdo and Narto Sabdo Ngesti Pandawa reached its peak of popularity and became an icon of Semarang. Ngesti Pandawa became a point of reference for other wayang orang groups in that era. Its theatrical scenery, musical accompaniment, costume, choreography, and stage tricks were emulated by other wayang orang groups.\n\nThe popularity of Ngesti Pandawa attracted the attention of President Sukarno. When Mount Merapi erupted 1953, Ngesti Pandawa was called to raise funds for the victims. President Soekarno invited Ngesti Pandawa to perform at the Istana Merdeka or Merdeka Palace in Jakarta and Istana Negara or the Palace in Bogor. This was certainly a proud moment for Ngesti Pandawa. For a wayang orang company, being invited to perform at the State Palace is certainly a great honour. Due to its achievements, Ngesti Pandawa in 1962 was again invited to the Presidential Palace to receive the Wijayakusuma Award from the President of the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nIn 1994, the GRIS complex was sold by the local government to a third party. Ngesti Pandawa had no home anymore, and had to move to the Taman Raden Saleh Cultural Complex and was housed in a theater building for two years. In 1996 it moved to the Majapahit Amusement Park and formed the Wayang Orang Ngesti Pandawa Foundation. In 2001 Ngesti Pandawa was again given the opportunity by the local government to use a hall at the Taman Raden Saleh cultural complex. Ngesti Pandawa reserves the right to use the hall every three days in a week. However, regular performances are only staged on Saturday evenings starting at 8 pm.\n\nDespite the ups and downs, the Wayang Orang Ngesti Pandawa continues to perform, keeping its mission to preserve Javanese culture and to entertain the people of Semarang and tourists visiting the city. Every Saturday at 8 pm Ngesti Pandawa is never fails to perform, presenting different lakons or stories from the vast wayang repertoire.\n\nSeveral social media such as his website, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube are used to get interest from the society and tourists.\n\nIn addition to regular performances at the Raden Saleh Cultural Park in Semarang, Ngesti Pandawa has also performed in other cities including Sukoharjo, Jepara, Solo, and Jakarta. Ngesti Pandawa even has performed for limited audiences such as students and government as well private institutions, as part of its effort to introduce wayang orang to the general public.\n\nThe head of Semarang City’s Culture and Tourism Office, Masdiana Safitri, has promised to renovate the venue of Ngesti Pandawa, to make it more attractive and comfortable for visitors. Hopefully, this will allow Ngesti Pandawa to regain its former glory, as an entertainment with a timeless moral message to all generations of people.\n\n"}
{"id": "21774604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21774604", "title": "Norev", "text": "Norev\n\nNorev is a French manufacturer of diecast metal model cars. traditionally based in Villeurbanne, a suburb of Lyon. It has normally produced modern and vintage European vehicles, especially those of French origin - though Italian, German, British, and American vehicles were also produced. Norev's closest competition was Solido, but that company had more pan-European influence, while Norev was more national in orientation.\n\nAccording to the official website, Norev was founded by the Veron brothers, in the suburb of Villeurbanne, near Lyon, France, in 1946 (Rixon 2005, p. 54). \"Norev\" is the family name spelled backwards. In 1953, after the first plastics toy fair in Oyonnax, Joseph Veron started using the new plastic 'Rhodialite' for a series of toys (Ralston 2008, p. 25). The company's first product was a small tin service garage with several plastic cars in about 1/87 scale. Other products at the company's start were toy watches, miniature sewing machines, a doll's feeding set and other plastic toys for infants (Ralston 2008, p. 25).\n\nAlso in 1953, was the watershed of the first Norev vehicles to appear. These were in 1:43 scale and manufactured in plastic.The plastic series consisted of 12 vehicles up through 1956, but then expanded rapidly to more than 96 models in 1964 (Ralston 2008, p. 26). Force's book (1991, pp. 164–235) shows that throughout the whole run of all Norev vehicles, without regard to scale or type, models were sequentially numbered from the first car as no. 1 in plastic (a Simca Aronde - 1953-1956) through no. 899 in zamac (a VW Golf Rally - 1984-1988) and beyond. The early models had colorful unpainted bodies which was a main selling point (Ralston 2008, 25-26). \n\nDuring this period, most of the models chosen were French marques such as the Simca Aronde (the first Norev model introduced), Renault 4CV, Ford Vedette, Peugeot 203, Citroen DS sedan, Renault Dauphine, Panhard Dyna, Renault 4 van, and the Renault Estafette van, among others (Ralston 2008, pp. 30-33). As time passed, more non-French makes appeared like the Lancia Aurelia or Land Rover Expedition. \n\nNorev plastic models were known for their bright body colors and their red (sometimes black) plastic hubs with white tires. Some of the attention to detail is notable, such as with the Citroen DS sedan, on the real car the roof section was separate and made of plastic. The Norev toy also made the roof a separate plastic section. Unfortunately, when that plastic came in contact with the body, a chemical reaction often caused discoloration (Ralston 2008, p. 32). Most models were available in both free-wheeling and friction motor versions (Ralston 2008, pp. 26, 31). Early bases were unpainted and shiny - later they were painted black (Ralston 2008, p. 30). Detail and proportion were very good and though the early models lacked windows (the Citroen DS was the first model to sport them), they were very successful and cheaper than the diecast metal competition (read that 'Dinky'; Ralston 2008, p. 25). \n\nMost models did not have many accessories, unlike the competitors Minialuxe, but a few items like roof skis did occasionally appear, like on the Panhard Dyna (Ralston 2008, p. 32). After about 1960, opening features began to appear on some - like the opening doors on the Renault 4 van or the Land Rover Expedition, which also featured a spare tire and roof luggage / equipment rack. Also, different companies would often be advertised on the sides of the model trucks and vans, like Locatel telephone, Cibie lights, or Fleury Michon, a provider of meat products (Ralston 2008, p. 33).\n\nThrough the 1950s the red hubs were replaced with more detailed chrome ones and tires gradually became black (though some white tires were used until the late 1950s) and windows were added. In 1957, a 1:87 scale '500' series appeared, mostly these were the same models that appeared in the 1:43 scale line.\n\nIn 1961, Emile Veron of the Veron family started Majorette, a separate company, also in the Lyon area. This new smaller line of cars would be competition for Matchbox and Siku Toys.\n\nThe first diecast metal Norev models appeared about 1965 (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, 64-65,86). Later, the famous 'Jet-Car' series, appeared in 1971. These were hierarchically labeled the '600', '700', and '800' series, sequentially as discussed above, according to cost. The '600' line was cheaply made and production soon stopped. The HO scale line was discontinued, but in the late 1970s, Force says that 1:66 scale Schucos appeared as a Norev line (the Mini-Jet series). The Mini-Jets were lauded for good castings while criticized for cheap plastic interiors and poor packaging (Rixon 2005, p. 55). Also, a Maxi-Jet line consisted mainly of trucks.\n\nNorev's main competition in the 1960s and 1970s was Solido, though Norev's offerings and approach to the market was somewhat more toy oriented, while Solido appealed more to older collectors. For example, Norev wheel designs were often simple, compared to the very accurate designs of Solido. Norev wheels were particularly generic and toy-like during the 'Jet Car' era when manufacturers everywhere were mimicking Mattel's thin axle Hot Wheels. Even early on Norev cars had cost-saving plastic bases while many others manufacturers were still making bases in diecast metal (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, 64-65). Nevertheless, Norev's cars were usually of excellent detail and proportion compared to real vehicles. One work that catalogs the extent and detail of Norev offerings was Le Monde Fantastique du Norev authored (in French) by Didier Beaujardin (2005).\n\nFrom the beginning, Norev used creative packaging and marketing. The early line glorified the benefits of plastic - early models came with an attached rectangular paper tag saying \"Rhodialite, Light, Solid and Strong\" (In French, \"Legerete, Solidite, Fidelite; see Ralston 2008, pp. 30-31). The company used successful advertising ploys like supplying toy shops with paper bags displaying the Norev line (Ralston 2008, pp. 25, 32). Norev boxes could be very intriguing (and sometimes rather fragile). For example the 1950s offerings came in cardboard boxes designed to mimic wooden packing crates with pictures of the cars on the sides (Ralston 2007, pp. 30-31). \n\nCars came with sweepstakes offers and lots of printed information. For example, the Jet-Car 800 series from 1974 had TWO sweepstakes offers. One was for the \"Great Norev Game\" (\"Grand Jeu Norev\") where one could collect the cartoon characters Norev, Jimmy, Tic, Costo, Comete, and Speed, color them and mail them back to the Norev 'Service Club' for prizes. Coloring had to be intricate though as the illustration of 'Tic' in the 1974 Renault 17 TS Coupe (no. 823) was only about two inches square. In the same package were coupons for the \"Great Norev Rally\" (\"Grand Rallye de Norev\"). Collect enough stamps, accumulating mileage in the rally, and you could win a Norev model car of your choice.\n\nThough Norev models could be ultra detailed, their packaging colors and offers seemed aimed at a younger clientele while Solido was more serious and rather stately in aiming its cars, more often in clear plastic display cases, at collectors - without sweepstakes and games.\n\nSometime around 1980, Norev either created or was taken over by LudOrev, which also issued other toys and doll playsets. Apart from the repeating of the last four letters \"-orev\", the origin of the name is unclear. Jet-Car packaging around the late 1980s said \"LudOrev locataire gerente de Norev\" (\"tenant manager of Norev\"). Possibly, the same old dies that were made and packaged in France were sold under the LudOrev name, distinguishing them from new offerings made in China.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Norev was acquired by daughter company Majorette just as Solido had been. Majorette was acquired by Smoby which in turn was taken over by the Simba Dickie Group. Today, Majorette remains part of Simba-Dickie, but Norev was spun off. In 1981 some of the earlier plastic models were reintroduced and then discontinued around 1984. Some of the lines were named \"Plastigam\" perhaps harking back to the plastic body days, but later the name was also used on diecast cars and their boxes.\n\nNorev has moved upscale with new collectible vehicles aimed more at adults. With the new millennium, Norev has taken several new directions while keeping its heritage. In 2005, a line of Japanese brand cars was inaugurated in addition to its 1:18 scale series. This approach mirrors that of other companies like Solido, Corgi Toys, and Schuco Modell where 1:43 scale cars are priced in the $30 to $40 range, while 1:18 scale lines sell for $60 to $70. Again, most of these newer models are made in China.\n\nIn 2006, Norev celebrated its 60th anniversary.\n\nNorev around 2010 has exhibited a couple of main trends. One is the relegation of certain models either sold by, or made under, other brand names. For example, several former Norev castings were made and sold as Atlas Editions collectors models, especially their series of French presidential limousines like the Citroen SM Presidentielle. Whether the cars are made by Norev for Atlas Editions or the castings sold off to Atlas and other companies is uncertain.\n\nAnother trend, as seen on the official website, is that Norev has acquired or re-introduced several venerable old diecast brands, including the French CIJ name and Provence Moulage. In 2008, Norev also reintroduced the Spot-On brand once made by Tri-Ang in Northern Ireland. This was a bit odd since Spot-On did not at all have a French flavor in its offerings. Whereas CIJ focuses on trucks and industrial models and Norev on more everyday French cars with some racing versions, the angle of Provence Moulage seems to be on French historical and concept vehicles of more upscale model pricing. Also in 2008, under the auspices of CIJ, it was announced that the historic brand of JRD would also be launched, but as of 2011, no new JRD models seem to have been produced.\n\nThus Norev, more than the more global Solido, has remained a very French entity traveling along a very nostalgic path reviving other lost French (and English) toy brands. Today, though much production has gone to China, the company is still headquartered near Villeurbanne, east of Lyon, in the municipality of Vaulx-en-Velin.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "623802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=623802", "title": "Reamker", "text": "Reamker\n\nReamker ( , also romanized as Ramakerti) is a Cambodian epic poem, based on the Sanskrit's Ramayana epic. The name means \"Glory of Rama\". It adapts the Hindu ideas to Buddhist themes and shows the balance of good and evil in the world. More than just a reordering of the epic tale, the Reamker is a mainstay of the royal ballet's repertoire. Like the Ramayana, it is a philosophical allegory, exploring the ideals of justice and fidelity as embodied by the protagonists, King Rama and Queen Sita. The epic is well known among the Khmer people for its portrayal in Khmer dance theatre, called the \"L'khaon\", in various festivals across Cambodia. Scenes from the Reamker are painted on the walls of the Royal Palace in Khmer style, and its predecessor is carved into the walls of the Angkor Wat and Banteay Srei temples. It is considered an integral part of Cambodian culture.\n\nThe Reamker differs from the original Ramayana in some ways, featuring additional scenes and emphasis on Hanuman and Sovanna Maccha.\n\nIn the Reamker, issues of trust, loyalty, love, and revenge play out in dramatic encounters among princes and giants, monkeys and mermaids, and a forlorn princess. Though it is understood that Preah Ream is an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, his characteristics and those of the others in the story are interpreted in Cambodia as those of mere mortals, not of the gods as is the case in India. The complex interplay of strengths and weaknesses, though couched in episodes lined with magic, nonetheless represents a decidedly human social behavior. \n\nAs in other Southeast Asian countries, the Rama story in Cambodia is not confined to the realm of literature but extends to all Cambodian art forms, from sculpture to dance drama, painting and art. Another epic, \"Lpoek Angkor Vat\" (“The Story of Angkor Wat”), which dates from the beginning of the 17th century, celebrates the magnificent temple complex at Angkor and describes the bas-reliefs in the temple galleries that portray the Rama story.\n\nThe original Ramayana arrived to Southeast Asia from South India along with Hinduism, but its retelling there suggests Buddhist influence. Intricate carvings on the walls of Angkor Wat depict a scene from the Ramayana dating back nearly a millennium. Statues of the poem's heroes were worshiped in temple sanctuaries, akin to the wall paintings at Cambodia's Royal Palace and Wat Bo. The Ramayana has been an important epic in India for at least two thousand years, and Reamker is its Khmer adaptation. The Cambodian version includes incidents and details not found in the Sanskrit original written by the poet Valmiki. An example of a story that does not appear in Indian texts and performance is that of the encounter between Hanuman, the monkey general, and Sovanna Maccha, the mermaid, a favorite of Cambodian audiences.\n\nThe Reamker plot begins with its protagonist, Phreah Ream or Rama, being sent into exile by one of the queen mothers who wanted her own son to inherit the throne. After being sent to the forest, Phreah Ream is joined by his beautiful and faithful wife Neang Seda (Sita), whom the prince won from her father by being the only Prince who successfully completed the father's challenge of firing arrows through a spinning wheel with spokes. Praeh Leak (Lakshmana), the younger brother of Phreah Ream, is concerned about his older brother and joins Neang Seda. \n\nWhile entering the forest, Neang Seda and Preah Leak meet the rakshasi Surpanakhar (Surphanakha) who first attempts to seduce Preah Ream, and then Preah Leak. Preah Leak, annoyed by the demon's action, cuts off her ear and nose. The butchered Surpanakhar thirsting for revenge went to her ten-headed brother Krong Reap (Ravana), invincible lord of the island of Lanka. Krong Reap secretly goes to the forest. When he first set eyes on Neang Seda, he was awed by her divine beauty. Krong Reap transforms himself as a golden deer and runs past the party of three. Preah Ream realizes that the deer is not a real deer, however, at Neang Seda's insistence Preah Ream chases it after telling his younger brother to stay and guard his wife. Krong Reap then mimics Preah Ream's voice and calls for his brother to come and save him. Although Preah Leak knows that it is not his brother calling out, he is forced to go at Neang Seda's insistence. However, before he leaves he draws a magical circle around his brother's wife in the dirt that will prevent anything from entering the circle. Krong Reap disguises himself as an old errant and easily tricks Neang Seda's to step outside the circle, after which he abducts her. Preah Ream and Preah Leak return and desperately search for Neang Seda and, in the meantime, they assist the monkey king Sukreep (Sugriva) to destroy his rival Pali Thirat (Vali) and regain his throne. Thanking the two, Sukreep sends the monkey warrior Hanuman to aid them in their search. Hanuman, the son of the wind god, flies out to discover that the demon Krong Reap held Neang Seda prisoner on the island of Lanka. \n\nHanuman order his soldiers to build a bridge of stone to connect the island Lanka to the mainland. While gathering stones, Hanuman realizes that mermaids were stealing stones to prevent the construction of the bridge. He was roused by this and decides to capture the mermaid princess Neang Machha but falls deeply in love with her. The mermaid likewise falls in love, and thus her mermaid army ceases to tamper in Hanuman's business. The bridge built, Preah Ream and Krong Reap face each other in combat. However, Krong Reap quickly regenerates and damage done to him or any body part that is cut off. It is not until one of Krong Reap's generals defects and discloses the secret to slaying the demon - an arrow in the belly button. With Hanuman's aid, they slay the demon. Preah Ream, victorious in his battles, returns to the capital of Ayuthya and ascends the throne. Preah Ream suspects infidelity as his wife was captive of a very smart and manipulative demon. Trust issues between him and his wife Neang Seda arise after his wife draws a picture of Krong Reap at the insistence of her maid servant (as the demon's true face was said to be the ugliest face there was). Fearing her husband's jealousy, Neang Seda puts the picture under the mattress when she is unexpectedly interrupted. Krong Reap's power extends to the picture and that night spikes grow from it and poke Preah Ream through the mattress. He discovers the picture and believes that it confirms his suspicion that his wife succumbed to Krong Reap's persistent attempts to bed her over the years that she was held prisoner. However, Neang Seda had resisted all Krong Reap's attempts, even that in which Krong Reap transformed himself into her husband. Only his scent had given his disguise away. Preah Ream forces his wife to take the trial of fire to prove she is still pure. Neang Seda passes the test. However, Neang Seda is deeply offended by her husband's lack of trust in her and his lack of belief in her word. She decides to leave and find refuge with Valmiki the wiseman, where she gives birth to twin boys. They met their father and he immediately recognizes who they are and takes them to his palace.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36377630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36377630", "title": "She Has a Name", "text": "She Has a Name\n\nShe Has a Name is a play about human trafficking written by Andrew Kooman in 2009 as a single act and expanded to full length in 2010. It is about the trafficking of children into sexual slavery and was inspired by the deaths of 54 people in the Ranong human-trafficking incident. Kooman had previously published literature, but this was his first full-length play. The stage premiere of \"She Has a Name\" was directed by Stephen Waldschmidt in Calgary, Alberta in February 2011. From May to October 2012, \"She Has a Name\" toured across Canada. In conjunction with the tour, A Better World raised money to help women and children who had been trafficked in Thailand as part of the country's prostitution industry. The first performances of \"She Has a Name\" in the United States took place in Folsom, California in 2014 under the direction of Emma Eldridge, who was a 23-year-old college student at the time.\n\nThe script calls for five actors to portray ten characters. The two main characters are Jason, a young Canadian lawyer; and Number 18, a young female prostitute who claims to be fifteen years old and has been a prostitute for six years. The drama centers on Jason's infiltration of a brothel ring that is trafficking girls into Bangkok. Jason comes to believe that Number 18 could be a key witness to a human trafficking incident and tries to gain her trust and persuade her to testify against the ring. The victimized child in the play is known only by the number 18 to reflect how traffickers often dehumanize their victims by giving them a new name or simply a number, which in some cases is branded onto the victim's body. Waldschmidt said he hoped that \"She Has a Name\" will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists.\n\n\"She Has a Name\" received strong endorsement from Canadian activists, including MP Joy Smith, Ratanak International's Brian McConaghy, and IJM Canada's Jamie McIntosh. The play's premiere and initial run were critically acclaimed. In the 2012 tour across Canada, \"She Has a Name\" was performed in several fringe theatre festivals, at which critics representing the \"Montreal Gazette\", the \"Winnipeg Free Press\", and CFEQ-FM said it stood out for its quality and moral content.\n\n\"She Has a Name\" was the first full-length play by Andrew Kooman, a playwright and author from Alberta in western Canada. He began work on it in 2008 and finished a one-act version by 2009, writing under the guidance of a dramaturge at a Scripts At Work workshop at Red Deer College. He drew on his experiences working with a Canadian film crew in Thailand in 2006. He intended to extend the script into a full-length play eventually. Kooman had previously written other literary works, including the young adult novel \"Ten Silver Coins: The Drylings of Acchora\", and two plays, \"Shelter\" and \"Joseph\", that had been selected for development at Scripts At Work workshops.\n\nKooman first became aware of human trafficking while he was working for the nonprofit organization Youth With A Mission (YWAM) in southeast Malaysia, where he met children who had been trafficked. Kooman later realized that people are also trafficked in Canada. Kooman wrote \"She Has a Name\" with the intention of bringing attention to this issue, specifically in connection with sexual exploitation.\n\nTo ground the play in reality, Kooman researched human trafficking and met with survivors. He read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident, in which 121 people were trafficked from Burma to Thailand and left in a locked water tank, which was then abandoned by its drivers and discovered only after 54 of the people had died from suffocation or hyperthermia. The truck carrying the water tank had been abandoned because it ran out of fuel. When the truck was discovered in April 2008, it contained men, women, and children. Knowing that many of the impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play.\n\nIn January 2010, there was a full reading of the one-act version of the play. Despite an unfinished script and a performance by amateur actors, it evoked a strong response from the audience. Later that year, Stephen Waldschmidt, an artistic associate of Burnt Thicket Theatre, asked to read the script of \"She Has a Name\", and later said he could not put it down. He was initially reluctant to attach himself to the play because of the immensity and ugliness of the issues therein, but he ultimately worked with Kooman to expand it into a full-length play with an extra hour of material by the end of 2010. The result is a play that can be performed in 90 minutes but may last up to two hours. Burnt Thicket Theatre served as the play's initial production company.\n\nThere are ten characters in \"She Has a Name\", but the script calls for only five actors, four female and one male. The main characters are Jason and Number 18. Jason is a young, Canadian lawyer with experience in corporate law. He found this work unsatisfying, so he started working in international human rights law for the United Nations and a non-governmental organization (NGO) that opposes sex trafficking. Number 18the play's heroineis a young, female prostitute who claims to be fifteen years old and has been a prostitute for six years. Ali is Jason's wife, and they have two young daughters. Marta is Jason's employer, who has become very tough from years of fighting for justice and who is now driven and stressed. The other characters are a pimp, who is unnamed, and his assistant, a cruel brothel keeper called Mama.\n\nThe script calls for one actor to play both male charactersJason and the pimp. Jason and Number 18 are haunted by four voices. As poetic and prophetic voices, these characters serve much the same purpose as a chorus in Greek tragedies, according to reviewer Lana Michelin of the \"Red Deer Advocate\". Variously considered angels or ghosts, the voices are written in the script to be played by the female actors who portray Number 18, Marta, Ali, and Mama. While these voices sometimes emphasize the horrors of the sex industry, at other times, they offer comfort to Number 18. It is only revealed at the play's conclusion that the chorus is made up of dead child prostitutes.\n\nA pimp rapes Number 18 in a bar, then enslaves her sexually. Number 18's father died when she was young and her family struggled to support her thereafter. Strangers took her from her home in Cambodia as a child, replaced her name with a number, and prostituted her in various countries. Number 18 ends up in the Thai child prostitution industry. Most of her clients are rich men, many of them foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 is kept in a dark room containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at her and beats her. Number 18 prays for a man to come and save her from these ordeals. At the same time she becomes the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and her pimp's favourite. She becomes very proficient in pleasing men sexually but also remains childlike—she dries her face with her skirt and plays with its hem.\n\nJason starts work with an NGO in Thailand, having left his wife and children in Canada and abandoned a lucrative job at his father-in-law's legal firm. He communicates with his wife Ali over Skype. Jason's first task is to find witnesses to or survivors from a human-trafficking incident and then to shut down the brothels into which they have been trafficked; his boss Marta sends him into the brothels as she cannot enter herself. His specific focus is an Asia-wide brothel ring's trafficking of girls into Bangkok for prostitution as part of the child sex tourism industry. An abandoned storage truck has been discovered containing the bodies of dead sex workers. Attempting to build a legal case against the brothel ring, Jason pays to see prostitutes in the hope that one of them witnessed the incident. The first prostitute he sees is Number 18, whose attempts to seduce him make him uneasy. Thinking Number 18 could be a key witness, he tries to persuade her to testify. The other prostitutes Jason encounters are too afraid to give evidence. Number 18 answers some of Jason's questions about where she is from, where she has worked, and how long she has been working, but only on the condition that Jason pay 100 baht for each response. She reveals that she has been prostituted in Thailand and Malaysia.\n\nIt is revealed that Number 18 was one of the girls in the storage truck, but that she escaped and ended up at The Pearl. Traumatized, she does not understand what Jason wants. She knows that every girl who has talked about the storage truck incident has been killed and is therefore reluctant to testify. One night Number 18 is injured in a party at the brothel and can barely walk when Jason visits. When he tells Ali about his experiences, she begs him to come home, but Jason believes he is in Bangkok by divine providence. Number 18 comes to understand that Jason is not like the other men who frequent The Pearl, and agrees to trust him and testify against the brothel ring if he can rescue her.\n\nJason pays Number 18's pimp enough money to take her out of the brothel for a weekend. Before he arrives to take her away, however, Mama finds and confiscates the money Jason has previously paid Number 18, and correctly guesses that he does not intend to bring her back. When Jason arrives to collect Number 18, Mama tells him she is dead and offers a refund. Believing Number 18 is still alive, Jason becomes violent. Mama mocks him, saying the Western culture he is part of is hedonistic and responsible for people in the Third World being sexually trafficked. Jason stops short of hurting Mama and leaves to report to Marta. Through her connections, Marta discovers that Number 18 is alive. Marta tries to save Number 18, posing as a lawyer protecting Number 18's rights. The pimp forces Marta off with a gun. When Jason makes another attempt to rescue Number 18, the pimp kills her. Number 18 joins the chorus of dead child prostitutes who have been watching over and commenting on events throughout the play.\n\nThe stage premiere of \"She Has a Name\" was directed by Waldschmidt, who was also the scenic designer. Aaron Krogman was selected to portray Jason and the unnamed pimp, Sienna Howell-Holden to portray Mama, Glenda Warkentin to portray Marta, Denise Wong to portray Number 18, and Cari Russell to portray Ali. Waldschmidt suggested that Warkentin audition for the play after seeing her perform at Rosebud Theatre in Rosebud, Alberta. Wong, Krogman, and Kooman spoke highly of Waldschmidt's directing, and Kooman praised Waldschmidt's work as scenic designer. Waldschmidt praised the cast's acting. He said he found the play's opening scene, in which a rape occurs, the most difficult to stage, despite having previously performed a similar rape scene as an actor. The premiere of \"She Has a Name\" was produced by Burnt Thicket Theatre in partnership with Raise Their Voice. The office of Joy Smith, MP for Kildonan—St. Paul, released a statement advertising the premiere of \"She Has a Name\".\n\nThe premiere took place at the EPCOR Centre for the Performing Arts in Calgary in February 2011. Performances were scheduled to run on the centre's Motel stage between February 23 and March 5. Tickets quickly sold out. Four days after the premiere, Burnt Thicket Theatre moved the play to the Scott Block Theatre in Red Deer, where the play was scheduled to be performed until March 12. All the performances in Red Deer were sold out. The play drew emotional reactions from the audience. Kooman learned that some audience members at the initial performances later responded to the play by talking with others about human trafficking, writing letters to their Members of Parliament, and doing other creative things on the subject. They also contacted Waldschmidt, sometimes up to a year later, with stories about how the play had continued to affect their lives. In conjunction with the initial run of \"She Has a Name\", Burnt Thicket Theatre provided the names of organizations that assist human-trafficking victims. There was also a panel discussion about human trafficking after the matinée on February 26.\n\nAfter the play's initial run, Kooman revised the script, making prominent changes in the scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in the new version, Marta makes real demands of Jason, making their interactions more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali more patient and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences from home and removed the intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the \"Red Deer Advocate\", Kooman's changes strengthened the emotional pull of the play. Because of the amount of interest in \"She Has a Name\" in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned for the end of 2011. To finance a tour of the play, Burnt Thicket Theatre raised money through fundraisers, which included the 2011 Calgary Ride for Refuge.\n\nIn August 2011, extracts from \"She Has a Name\" were read at a conference in Strathmore called Justice Tapestry. A reading of the play took place during an event at Mount Royal University on February 16, 2012, which also included a speech by Yvon Dandurand on the subject of human trafficking, and a book signing by John Winterdyk for his book \"Human Trafficking: Exploring the International Nature, Concerns, and Complexities\".\n\nThe 2012 tour of \"She Has a Name\" was a fringe theatre tour across Canada. The performances were co-produced by Burnt Thicket Theatre and Raise Their Voice and were directed by Waldschmidt. Carl Kennedy portrayed Jason, Evelyn Chew portrayed Number 18, Alysa van Haastert portrayed Ali, and Warkentin and Howell-Holden returned as Marta and Mama. To avoid giving the impression that human trafficking is limited to Asia, the producers deliberately cast actors who were not of Asian descent.\n\nThe tour started on May 23 in Lethbridge and went on to the other Canadian cities of Saskatoon, Ottawa, Montreal, Halifax, London, Winnipeg, Calgary, Victoria, Vancouver, Kelowna, Edmonton, and Red Deer. London was added mid-tour because of popular demand. The London performances were hosted by Men Against Sexual Trafficking and the London Anti-Human Trafficking Committee. The final performances of the tour were conducted at the Scott Block Theatre in Red Deer from October 2 to 6. After the Saturday matinée in each city, a panel discussion was held with both the audience and anyone else who wanted to attend, the purpose being to raise awareness about human trafficking in Canada and elsewhere. The final talkback panel in Red Deer was attended by about 70 people.\n\nA Better World partnered with Raise Their Voice to raise funds throughout the tour to help women and children who had been trafficked in Thailand as part of the country's prostitution industry. Kooman stated that he had \"a 'pinch me' sort of feeling that [the 2012 tour] has happened, and that there is interest beyond this tour\". Cynthia Foster, who attended one of the performances during the tour, went on to produce and direct the first school production, with students at Strathcona Christian Academy Secondary School acting in two performances at La Cite in Edmonton in November 2014. Kooman was scheduled to facilitate a discussion about sex trafficking with the audience after each performance.\n\nThe first performances of \"She Has a Name\" in the United States were produced by FreeFall Stage in a rented space at Victory Life Church in Folsom, California in 2014 under the direction of Emma Eldridge, who was a 23-year-old college student at the time. She and her sister had become passionate about the issue of human trafficking as a result of their involvement with the organization Run for Courage, and the two sisters considered writing a play about human trafficking in the United States. Because they were both college students, they did not find the time to write a play, so in 2013, their mother, Deedee Eldridge, began looking for a human-trafficking-related play that had already been written and she discovered \"She Has a Name\". It was the only play she was able to find on the subject of human trafficking. Emma Eldridge later said of \"She Has a Name\", \"I've never read something and been so compelled to do it.\" The family decided to stage the play, and Deedee Eldridge served as producer and executive director. To have the rights to produce the play, FreeFall Stage made a special arrangement with the Playwrights Guild of Canada.\n\nFor these initial performances in 2014, the characters of Jason and the pimp were portrayed by different actors; Chris Quandt portrayed Jason and Arturo Gonzalez portrayed the pimp. The role of Number 18 was taken on by Supatchaya \"Jazz\" Sunpanich, who was born in Thailand. Emma Eldridge attested to crying at the first rehearsal as a result of being moved by the intensity of Sunpanich's performance. In these performances, Ali was portrayed by Brianna Flynn and Adison Kingsley, Marta by Marybeth Moore and Janine Romney, and Mama by Sara Matsui-Colby. The voices were separately portrayed by Caitlyn Wardell, Bonnie Antignani, and Jeannette Baisch. These performances were staged in partnership with Run for Courage, which had representatives at each performance. Performances were scheduled to run from May 2 to June 22.\n\nFreeFall Stage discouraged people under the age of fifteen from attending because of the subject matter of the play, but encouraged older teenagers to attend because teenagers are at the greatest risk of being trafficked. Several human trafficking survivors attended the performances, and other survivors sent the Eldridges messages about their personal experiences with human trafficking. Quandt said that he encountered many audience members who, because of watching the play, became determined to do something to combat human trafficking.\n\nBy February 2012, Kooman was working on a screenplay version of \"She Has a Name\". The idea of a stage-to-film adaptation of \"She Has a Name\" was also independently suggested by Pat Donnelly of the \"Montreal Gazette\". In 2014, Kooman and his younger brothers, Daniel and Matthew, scouted locations in Cambodia in preparation for the film.\n\nKooman made justice the focus of \"She Has a Name\"; the social issues that interest him include poverty, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the effects of war. The central issues in \"She Has a Name\" are gender-based. The general topic of the play is human traffickingspecifically the trafficking of children into sexual slavery. Kooman has stated that \"She Has a Name\" \"suggests that justice can only be realized if real people know, care and take informed and decisive action.\" The victimized child in the play is known only by the number 18 to reflect that traffickers often dehumanize their victims by giving them a new name or simply a number, which in some cases is branded onto the victim's body. After his rape of Number 18, the pimp leaves the situation without adverse effect, but Number 18 is left bleeding from her crotch and mouth. The play invites viewers to feel sympathetic towards Number 18, and, although the world of human trafficking is depicted as horrific and ugly, both the victims and perpetrators of human trafficking are portrayed as relatable characters, suggesting that every individual has inherent value and dignity. In an interview with \"The Calgary Journal\" prior to the 2012 tour, Waldschmidt said that the sympathetic portrayal of the perpetrators prevents the play from becoming a simplistic story of good and evil. According to Liz Nicholls of the \"Edmonton Journal\", Number 18 is a nuanced character, better-developed than the stock damsel in distress.\n\nKooman said that the massive proportions of human trafficking often prevent people from dealing with it; he therefore chose to portray a single trafficked victim in the play so that audiences could approach the subject on a more workable level. He hoped that audiences would avoid getting stuck in the statistics of human trafficking and would connect with a personal story. The two questions that propel the story are: \"Can [Jason] convince [Number 18] to risk her life to testify for the sake of justice?\" and \"Can he save her from the unthinkable circumstances?\" Jason is weary and, although he never falls into self-pity, he comes to hate himself for his inability to save Number 18 from her slavery because he lacks the evidence he requires for his case to be successful in court.\n\nMuch of the play is concerned with demonstrating the immensity of the difficulties that face Jason in trying to rescue Number 18. For example, he finds it difficult to be away from his wife, and struggles with the decision of whether to continue his work or return to Canada. To depict this tension, Jason and Ali communicate via Skype, represented on stage by two laptop computers placed back-to-back with Jason and Ali standing on either side facing one another. The two argue, but their interactions demonstrate the kind of love that Number 18 can only dream of. In the 2012 cross-Canada tour, a torn picture of Number 18's family remained on stage as scenery to emphasize what the character has lost. This picture took the form of a painted curtain held over a geometric floor pattern and depicted the family as tired, poor, and living in a shack. Lana Michelin of the \"Red Deer Advocate\" said the most emotionally gripping scene was the one in which the voices cause Number 18 to recall the face of her dead father. Anna Borowiecki of the \"St. Albert Gazette\" called the play a story of \"fallible people who find strength in each other under the worst conditions.\"\n\nDenise Wong, the Calgarian actor who portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, said that the play was about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor who took over the role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in intensity to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls attention to the fact that poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage \"She Has a Name\" partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.\n\nThe \"Country Sunrise News\" stated that the drama has a fast pace. Mallory Clarkson of the London Community News reported that, while \"She Has a Name\" is an emotional play, there are lighter moments where audience members can laugh. Similarly, Lana Michelin of the \"Red Deer Advocate\" asserted that the play's sporadic humorous points maintain the audience's engagement with the story so they do not become numb to the play's emotional pulls. Kooman stated that he tried to write the play in a way that would shock audiences without disturbing them to the point that they would not recommend it to friends.\n\nMarlo Campbell, a writer for \"Uptown\", said that the play critiques masculine egotism and Western heroism through the character of Jason. Lana Michelin of the \"Red Deer Advocate\" disagreed, stating that Jason never lapses into self-importance. Aaron Krogman, who portrayed Jason and the pimp in the play's premiere, said, \"there is a thin line between Jason and the pimp ... both characters are struggling with power and how they use it.\" Waldschmidt stated that the doubling of this role is intended to remind audiences that there are Canadians who are perpetrators of human trafficking and that it \"is not just somebody else's problem over there ... but that it's us, and it's in our country and in our backyard and in our suburbs\". Jason has in this way been considered an everyman. Chris Quandt, who portrayed Jason at the United States premiere, said that he and his fellow cast members greatly appreciated the fact that Kooman incorporated into the play the facts that taking down one brothel often leaves space for another brothel to be established soon afterwards, and that child sex tourism exists because there is a demand for it.\n\nOne Canadian critic said that the play's Bangkok setting allows Canadians to easily dissociate from the issue. Liz Nicholls of the \"Edmonton Journal\" wrote that the pimp character \"represents the ruthless spirit of pure human greed.\" Stephen Pederson of \"The Chronicle Herald\" called the play a combination of idealism, realism, and lyricism. Dustin Wiebe of the \"Mennonite Brethren Herald\" wrote that the play shows \"the darker side of man's desire for control\" by presenting Number 18 as having been stripped of her humanity. The disaster that concludes the play is foreshadowed throughout. The play both starts and ends with a depiction of the reality of contemporary slavery.\n\nCritical response to \"She Has a Name\" began with initial readings of the play at the 2009 Scripts At Work workshop, where the script was given the Scripts At Work/Alberta Playwrights Network Award. The play has since become very successful and was endorsed by Canadian activists including MP Joy Smith, Ratanak International's Brian McConaghy, and IJM Canada's Jamie McIntosh. Lara Quarterman, director of the Calgary chapter of ACT Alberta, said she was concerned that \"She Has a Name\" suggests that human trafficking is limited to the sex trafficking of women and children in Thailand, but there is sexual-slavery-related human trafficking in Canada, and there is also human trafficking for the purposes of unfree labour. The chorus of dead human-trafficking victims has generally received negative reviews; one critic called it \"the play's least successful device\". Adrian Chamberlain of the Victoria \"Times Colonist\" criticised some of the script, charging that there were \"implausible plot twists\" and other \"fundamental flaws\", but concluded that it was well-intentioned and ambitious and \"has its heart in the right place.\"\n\nThe play's premiere and initial run were mostly critically acclaimed. The religious community's reviews of the initial run were also positive. After the first performances in 2011, Louis Hobson of the \"Calgary Sun\" said the character of Marta was an unrealistic caricature and didn't \"ring true\" because of how she was written. The character underwent a series of rewrites to make her more well-rounded and kind before the 2012 cross-Canada tour. In the 2012 tour, the play was performed in several fringe theatre festivals, at which critics representing the \"Montreal Gazette\", the \"Winnipeg Free Press\", and CFEQ-FM said it stood out for its quality and moral content. The writing was praised by one critic from the \"Victoria News\", who wrote that the play demonstrates that Kooman has a \"gift for creating powerful, believable dialogue that can draw an audience in\", but criticised by Chamberlain of the \"Times Colonist\", who attested to \"melodramatic—and just plain bad—cop-show dialogue\". Liz Nicholls of the \"Edmonton Journal\" called the performances compelling. Karen Nelson, also of the \"Edmonton Journal\", called the play \"sobering\" in such a way that she was caused \"to wonder what [she] could do about this global epidemic of abuse of children, women and the disenfranchised.\"\n\nDuring the 2012 tour, Kooman was awarded the Outstanding Alumnus Provincial Award Celebrating Excellence by the Alberta Association of Colleges & Technical Institutes and the Alberta Ministry of Enterprise. At the St-Ambroise Montreal Fringe Festival, \"She Has a Name\" was nominated for the 2012 Centaur Theatre Award for Best Anglophone Production. At the Victoria Fringe Theatre Festival, \"She Has a Name\" was selected for a \"Pick of the Fringe\" award. Later in the 2012 tour, Sienna Howell-Holden won a Spirit of the Fringe Award at the Vancouver Fringe Festival for her portrayal of Mama.\n\nWhen the play was staged in California in 2014, Gerry Camp of \"The Folsom Telegraph\" said that he had \"never been more emotionally drained than ... after seeing the riveting opening night performance.\" He praised all of the actors' performances, and particularly those of Quandt and Sunpanich. \"If you truly love theater, you must see this play,\" he concluded. \"And I promise you, it is a play you will carry with you long after the lights have gone up.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2238248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2238248", "title": "Singaporean Mahjong scoring rules", "text": "Singaporean Mahjong scoring rules\n\nThe Singaporean Mahjong scoring rules are similar to that of the Chinese Old Style / Hong Kong system, but accounts for the different set of tiles used.\n\nThe Singaporean Mahjong tile system consists of 148 tiles due to the additional Animal tile set, thus slightly different from that of other regional Mahjong tile-sets. Therefore, the rules of the game somewhat vary from other scoring systems in the region. The stacking of tiles will be 19 stacks for the dealer (East) and the player opposite (West), 18 stacks for the rest. The Dead Wall (王牌\"wáng-pái\") is 15 tiles. The tile set is described as follows:\n\nThese tiles run from One to Nine. There are 4 of each tile in every set.\n\nThe dots suit (筒子, pinyin \"tǒng zi\")\n\nThe bamboo suit (索子, pinyin \"suǒ zi\")\n\nThe character suit (万子, pinyin \"wàn zi\")\n\nHonour Tiles (字牌\"zì-pái\" / 大牌\"dà-pái\") consists of 4 Wind tiles & 3 Dragon tiles.\n\nWind tiles (四风牌, pinyin \"sì fēng pái\")\n\n<br>\nFrom left to right: East, South, West, North\n\nDragon tiles (三元牌, pinyin \"sān yuán pái\")\n\n<br>\nFrom left to right: Red Dragon, Green Dragon, White Dragon\n\nFlower set (花牌 \"huā pái\") and Season set (季牌 \"jì pái\")\n\n<br>\nFrom left to right: Plum, Orchid, Chrysanthemum, Bamboo, Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter\n\nAnimal Tiles(禽兽牌\"qín shòu pái\" / 动物牌\"dòng wù pái\")\n\nFrom left to right: Cat, Rat, Rooster, Centipede\n\nPoints (台) are scored from the difficulty of gathering the winning hand. If monetary rewards (and losses) are involved, it is common that playing parties will agree upon a monetary value awarded to a one-point winning hand. Subsequently, for each additional point scored, this value is accordingly doubled.\n\nThere is a typical maximum scoring limit of five points, though this has to be agreed among players. This point limit (simply known as the \"limit\"), and will be used to describe the points awarded by certain tile-combinations from now on. In other words, a certain tile combination that awards the \"limit\" means that it scores the maximum number of points, as agreed upon before the game.\n\nFor example, assume that players agree on a value of S$1 for a one-point winning hand. A two-point winning hand thus has a value of S$2, a three-point hand with a value of $4, up to a limit of $16 for a five-point winning hand.\n\nFurthermore, the party who is guilty of discarding the tile which another party then takes to complete a winning hand has to pay double the agreed payout. Another situation where the winning player receives double the agreed payout is when he draws the winning tile by himself/herself i.e. Self-Pick(自摸\"zì-mō\").\n\nThe following table summarizes the payouts, based on an assumed base payout of S$1 for a one-point winning hand.\nIn the event that the winning player draws the winning tile by himself/herself, Self-Pick(自摸\"zì-mō\"), the payout is as follows:\n\nAnother common mahjong payout among younger Singaporeans involves 'shooter pays all' whereby the person who discards the winning tile will have to compensate for the rest of the players. However for this rule, certain rules like 'Fresh Tile Mahjong Scenario (包生)' and '包满台' etc do not come in effect as the loser will have to pay for everyone when he/she discards the winning tile. Some Singaporeans have this particular rule whereby the person who 自摸 the winning tile shall be compensated an additional $2 on top of what everyone has to pay.\n\n1/2 Payout Chart\nHaving a triplet of any Dragon Tile(元yuán) scores 1 point. This triplet can be obtained by Pong(碰\"pèng\"), Kong(杠\"gàng\"), or simply having these 3 tiles in your hidden hand.\n\nHaving a triplet of the seat wind or the prevailing wind scores 1 point. This triplet can be obtained by Pung(碰\"pèng\"), Kong(杠\"gàng\" ), or simply having these three tiles in your hidden hand.\n\nIf the Prevailing Wind(圈风\"quān-fēng\") happens to coincide with your Seat Wind(门风\"mén-fēng\"), and you manage to obtain a triplet of that wind, you score 2 points. For example, if the prevailing wind is East and a player whose seat wind is East, a triplet of East by the player will score 2 points upon Mahjong.\n\nIf there is a triplet of both the Seat Wind(门风\"mén-fēng\") \"and\" the Prevailing Wind(圈风\"quān-fēng\"), you score 2 points. For example, if the Prevailing Wind(圈风\"quān-fēng\") is East and a player whose Seat Wind(门风\"mén-fēng\") is South, a triplet of East and a triplet of South by the player will score 2 points (1 point for each triplet) upon Mahjong.\n\nEach animal tile obtained scores 1 point. One extra point (for a total of 5) is awarded if all 4 animals are collected.\n\nIt is commonly accepted that there will be a one-time payout by all playing parties to the party who collects either\n\na) Both the cat tile and the mouse tile.\n\nb) Both the chicken tile and the centipede tile.\n\nThe above two events are known as \"yǎo-dào\" (咬到). Literally it means 'Bitten' in English.\n\nc) All the four animal tiles. This generally also earns double of the agreed one-time payout.\n\n咬到 has 2 different meanings in the game. When any player opens their tiles in the beginning of the game and sees the combination of a) and/or b) and c), he will be considered to have 暗咬, and compensation will usually be $4 for each combination of a), b) or c) (all these are cumulative). If after replenishment of tiles(补花\"bǔ-huā\") happened and any of the a), b) or c) happens, then compensation will usually be $2 for each combination of a), b) or c) (all these are cumulative).\n\n\"Note 1.1.1\": \"One-time\" refers to each instance whenever any player collects any of the above. In other words, if player A collects set(c) in the current game, he will receive the payout from all other parties immediately. In the event that player A collects the same set in the next game, he will again have to be compensated as well. This compensation will take place each time any set described above is collected.\n\n\"Note 1.1.2\": This payout is also one-time because the player who obtains the set combination(s) will not be re-compensated for these combinations at the end of the game, regardless of the result.\n\n\"Note 1.1.2.1\": However, pertaining to the above, the points scored by obtaining animal tiles will still be in effect. In other words, if player A collects set(c), he will be rewarded with an instant payout. In the event that he wins that same instance of the game as well, he will have scored 5 points by virtue of having 4 animal tiles, on top of any other points that he scores with his winning hand.\n\n\"Note 1.2\": The payout above is cumulative. This means that if a player collects set(c), he will have to be compensated for set(a), set(b) \"and\" set(c).\n\n\"Note 1.3\": A commonly agreed payout is, assuming a base payout of S$1 for a one-point winning hand, S$2 (which means collecting set(c) will earn a payout of $2+$2+$4). In other words, the payout can be pegged to that of a one-point 'Self-Pick'(自摸\"zì-mō\"). This must however be separately agreed-upon before the start of the game.\n\n\"Note 1.4\": In the special event that set (a) or set (b) is collected immediately at the start of the game (even before the 'Replacement Tile'(补花\"bǔ-huā\") event), the payout is again doubled. With reference to Note 1.3, if a player collects set (c) in this special case, he will receive a payout of $2*2 + $2*2 + $4.\n\nEach flower tile that matches a player's seat wind scores one point(正花\"zhèng-huā\"). Other flower tiles won't score any point.(偏花\"piān-huā\")\n\n\nIt is commonly accepted that there will be a one-time payout by all playing parties to the party who collects both flowers (red and blue) that match the player's Seat Wind. This is a 'Bitten'(咬到\"yǎo-dào\") event.\nThis payout is equivalent to obtaining a set of cat-and-mouse tile, or chicken-and-centipede tile. Refer to the discussion above. This will earn the payout agreed for a 'Bitten'(咬到\"yǎo-dào\") event.\nThe double payout scheme applies when the collection of both flowers occurs before the 'Replacement Tile'(补花\"bǔ-huā\") event. Refer to the discussion above. This will earn the payout agreed for an 'Concealed Kong'(暗杠\"àn-gàng\") event.\n\nNote: Not everybody plays with all these \"Bitten'(咬到\"yǎo-dào\") events so it is best to confirm with everybody before commencing your mahjong game. Some play with 'Bitten'(咬到\"yǎo-dào\") events only for the Animal tiles, and some do not play with any 'Bitten'(咬到\"yǎo-dào\") events at all.\n\nA complete group of 4 flower tiles of the same colour scores a total of 2 points, 1 for the flower tile that matches the player's seat wind, and 1 for collecting all four.\n\nIt is commonly accepted that there will be a one-time payout by all playing parties to the party who collects the complete set of flowers of the same colour. This is a 'Concealed Kong'(暗杠\"àn-gàng\") event.\n\nThis payout is equivalent to obtaining a set of cat-mouse-chicken-centipede tile. In other words, this will earn the payout agreed for a 'Concealed Kong'(暗杠\"àn-gàng\") event. Refer to the discussion above.\n\nAny player who collects 2 complete groups of 4 flower tiles (8 in total) either by 'Self-Pick'(自摸\"zì-mō\") or by 'robbing', has achieved a '8 Flower Tile-set'(花胡huā-hù) that scores the limit. Because of its rarity, there is a lack of agreement as to the number of points actually scored by this hand. However, in practice, this combination simply scores the maximum number of points.\n\nAny player who collects 2 complete groups of 4 flower tiles (8 in total) all by himself i.e. 'Self-Pick'(自摸\"zì-mō\") is called 'All Flowers & Seasons' or 'Eight Immortals'(八仙过海\"bā-xiān-guò-hǎi\"), a type of '8 Flower Tile-set'(花胡huā-hù). The combination of hidden cards held by the player does not matter at all, and the game is considered to have been won and game is ended as a win for the player.\n\nHowever, some players are notably particular regarding the above point. If any player collects the complete '8 Flower Tile-set', he wins the game, but he should never reveal his hidden cards to anyone. This follows from the fact that the player has not won the game by virtue of his hidden cards, which should be the case. If the player with the complete set of flowers display his hidden hand to the rest, and it is not a hand that fulfills any winning combination, he is considered to have cheated, or 'Fake Hand' (诈胡\"zhà-hú\") and must instead compensate the rest of the parties. The point to note is that the player who collects the complete '8 Flower Tile-set' should immediately close his hidden cards and declare himself to have won the game.\n\nThe player who completes the flower set has triggered 3 events, on top of winning the game. He has gathered \n\nAll 3 events above are liable for one-time compensation by the rest of the playing parties, if the event themselves are not compensated already. This is on top of the payout given to the winning party by winning the game.\n\nIf a player has already drawn 7 flower tiles, and \"any\" of the other three players draws the last flower tile, the player with the 7 tiles is considered to have won the game by \"robbing\" the last flower tile as a discard of the player that draws the last flower tile. This is called 'Robbing the Eighth'(七抢一 \"qī-qiǎng-yī\").\n\nThe player who drew the last flower tile, strictly speaking, did not discard the tile. However, due to the immense probabilistic difficulty of achieving a complete '8 Flower Tile-set'(花胡huā-hù), such a situation described above is considered a sufficient condition for a '8 Flower Tile-set'(花胡huā-hù) event.\n\n\"Note 1\": The player who drew the last flower tile, and thus causing the player with 7 flower tiles to win the game, will thus be the 'guilty' party, and is subjected to the same payout scheme described in Table 1.1.\n\n\"Note 2\": It is extremely important that, in the event that a player amasses 7 flower tiles, he \"must\" declare that he demands an inspection of everyone's hidden hand at the end of the game and describe the 'Pao'(包\"bāo\") condition in this scenario which is described below. In the event if the eighth flower did not appear in the course of the game, and the game ends:\n\n(i)in a stalemate(荒牌\"huāng pái\") with 15 un-drawn tiles remaining, the player who amasses the 7 flower tiles \"must\" just before the last tile (which is the 16th tile from the back) is drawn, declare that he will conduct an inspection of everyone's hidden hand.\n\n(ii) with some other player won the game, the player who amasses the 7 flower tiles \"must\" immediately declare that he will conduct an inspection of everyone's hidden hand, so to prevent anyone from dismantling their tiles away.\n\nAfter this declaration, the rest of the playing parties should reveal their hidden hand to the declaring player. If he discovers that one of the parties has been keeping the eighth flower within his hidden hand, he is considered to have won the game with a '8 Flower Tile-set'(花胡huā-hù), even if the game has already ended.\n\nThe 'guilty' party can either be made to pay for everyone's losses (known as 'Pao'(包\"bāo\")), or pay as if the game was won mid-way, as it should be. This will depend on the agreement between all playing parties. Any party who does not heed the declaration of card inspection and proceeds to dismantle the tiles upon the ending of the game (so that it will be impossible for the declaring player to inspect his cards) will also be deemed to be guilty of holding on the eight flower tile in secret, and the declaring player is considered to have won the game with a '8 Flower Tile-set'(花胡huā-hù).\n\n\"Note 3\": As described above, the winning party should not disclose his hidden hand, in the event of a '8 Flower Tile-set'(花胡huā-hù), if it does not fulfill the criteria of any winning combinations. If he does, some players may consider this to be cheating, or 'Fake Hand'(诈胡\"zhà-hú\"), and the winning-turned-losing party must compensate the rest of the playing parties.\n\nA 'Triplets Hand' (对对胡duì-duì-hú or 碰碰胡pèng-pèng-hù) scores 2 points.\n\nThe above is an example of a hand that satisfies a 碰碰胡\"pèng-pèng-hù\" combination that scores two points, that is, any 4 triplets and any pair of tiles (eyes) to fulfill this combination. It does not matter if your hand of tiles is a mixture of Exposed Pong(碰\"pèng\") tiles and triplets held within your hidden hand.\n\nHowever a special condition arises when this combination is held entirely within the winning party's hidden hand. That is, the winning party fulfills this combination with a Self-Pick(自摸\"zì-mō\"), and has no exposed 'Pong'(碰\"pèng\") tiles or 'Exposed Kong'(明杠\"mìng-gàng\"). In other words, the winning party drew and obtained every tile in this combination himself. This hand is refer to as 'Hidden Treasure'(四暗刻sì-àn-kè or 坎坎胡kǎn-kǎn-hù) is extremely rare and it is generally awarded the limit.\n\n\"Note 1\": To achieve the winning combination of \"Hidden Treasure\", the winning party can only perform 'Concealed Kong'(暗杠\"àn-gàng\") if he has 4-of-a-kind of a particular tile. He cannot perform an 'Exposed Kong'(明杠\"mìng-gàng\") on any discarded tile from the rest of the players. If he does, the winning hand can only be considered as a 'Triplets Hand'.\n\n\"Note 2\": To achieve a winning combination of \"Hidden Treasure\", the winning party \"must\" complete the game with a 'Self-Pick'(自摸\"zì-mō\"). It is immaterial whether he has already 4 hidden triplets, and is awaiting one single tile to complete the eye, or otherwise.\n\n\"Note 3\": In some playing circles, it is sufficient to have 4 hidden triplets and go mahjong with a single tile, and still be able to qualify for this hand as all the 4 triplets are still in the hand.\n\nA 'Half Flush Hand'(混一色\"hún-yī-sè\" or 半色\"bàn-sè\") scores 2 points.\n\nThe above are examples of combinations which fulfill the 'Half Flush' criteria. This combination simply requires\n\n1) a pure set of tiles from \"one single suit\" either from the 'Character'(万子), 'Dots'(筒子) or 'Bamboo'(索子) tile sets, plus\n\n2) any set of tiles from the 'Winds Tiles'(四风牌\"sì fēng pái\") or 'Dragon Tiles'(三元牌\"sān yuán pái\") suit.\n\nIf the set of tiles are entirely from \"one single suit only\" , then this combination is known as Full Flush Hand(清一色\"qīng-yī-sè\"). This combination is awarded 4 points.\n\nAgain, special conditions can arise from this.\n\nIf the set of tiles are entirely from \"one single suit\", and it also fulfill the Sequence Hand, then this special combination is known as Full Flush Sequence Hand(清一色平胡). Due to its extreme difficulty, in addition to the probabilistic difficulty of not drawing any animal or flower tiles, it is generally awarded 10 points, or the limit.\n\nAnother special condition can arise from having a hand of all triplets and a pair of eyes, either from the \"wàn-zǐ\" (万子), \"tòng-zǐ\" (筒子) or \"suò-zǐ\" (索子) tile sets. This Full Flush Triplets Hand(清一色碰碰胡) will score 8 points (2 for the hand itself, 2 for a Triplets Hand(碰碰胡) combination, and 4 for a Full Flush Hand(清一色) combination), or the limit.\n\n(iii)Another special condition can arise from amassing the 13 tiles as shown below, either from the Character(万子\"wàn-zǐ\"),the Dots (筒子\"tòng-zǐ\") or the Bamboo(索子\"suò-zǐ\") tile sets.\n\nNotice that these 13 tiles do not constitute a winning hand. However, any player, by virtue of having these 13 cards, can simply win the game with \"any\" discarded tile from that same suit. The player can chow to obtain the sequences, or pong to obtain the ones and nines triplets. As long as a player amasses these 13 cards, and wins the game with \"any\" tile of the same suit, he will have completed this rare 'Nine Gates Hand'(九连宝灯\"jǐu-lián-bǎo-dēng\"), which awards the limit.\n\nA \"Mixed Terminals Hand\" (混么九\"hún-yāo-jǐu\"/混老头\"hún-lǎo-tou\"), or commonly known as \"dà-pái-yī-jǐu\" (大牌一九) scores 4 points (2 for the combination itself, and 2 for the \"Triplets Hand\" (對對胡 or 碰碰胡)).\nThis is a mixture of\n\n1. ones or nines (thus, \"terminals\") from either of the \"wàn-zǐ\" (万子), \"tòng-zǐ\" (筒子) \"or\" \"suò-zǐ\" (索子)\n\nor\n\n2. either of the Winds tiles (风\"fēng\") \"or\" Dragon tiles (元\"yuán\").\n\nIt \"must\" also fulfill the Triplets Hand(碰碰胡\"pèng-pèng-hù\") criteria. However, special situations, as described below, can arise from this.\n\nThe 'Pure Terminals Hand'(清么九\"qīng-yāo-jǐu\"/清老头\"qīng- lǎo-tou\") is made up \"entirely\" of ones \"or\" nines from either of the \"wàn-zǐ\" (风子), \"tòng-zǐ\" (筒子) \"or\" \"suò zi\" (索子) tilesets. This condition is also known as 一九\"yī-jǐu\". Due to its extreme rarity, this is awarded the limit.\nThe All Honours Hand(字一色\"zì-yī-sè\") is made up \"entirely\" of tiles from either the Winds tiles(风\"fēng\") \"or\" Dragon tiles (元\"yuán\") tiles. This condition is also known as 大字\"dà-zì\". Due to its extreme rarity, this is awarded the limit.\n\nA Sequence Hand (平胡\"píng-hù\") scores 4 points. In addition, the winning player has to be waiting for at least 2 different tiles in order to win.\n\nA 'Sequence Hand' is one where a player obtains a winning hand of 4 sets of sequences (順子\"shùn zǐ\") and 1 pair of tiles, all from either the Character(万子\"wàn-zǐ\"), Dots(筒子\"tòng-zǐ\") or Bamboo(索子\"sùo-zǐ\") tile sets.(However, special allowance is given to the nature of the pair of tiles. These pair of tiles can be from the Character tiles, Dots tiles or the Bamboo tiles, or any Winds(风\"fēng\") which is \"neither\" the Prevailing Wind(圈风\"quān-fēng\") \"nor\" the Seat Wind(门风\"mén-fēng\") of the winning player.\n\nThe act of forming a melded sequence is called 'Chow'(吃\"chī\").\n\nA 'Sequence Hand' is considered difficult to amass because winning with this hand requires that (i)the player does not draw any animal or flower tiles. \n(ii)The player cannot win on a discarded tile by another player, if that discarded tile is an in-between tile(嵌张\"qiàn zhāng\"), edge tile(边张\"biān zhāng\"), or only one tile required to complete the pair(单钓\"dān diào\"), i.e. All Single Wait(一飞\"yī fēi\"/单听\"dān tīng\") is not acceptable for this hand.\nNote: 2-Sided Wait or more is acceptable for this hand in Singapore. For example, 6,7,8 & 9 of the Dots tiles, waiting for 6 & 9 of the Dots tiles to win by forming a pair.\n\nExample: A player has the seven of the Dots tiles and the nine of the Dots tiles, he requires the eight of the Dots tiles to complete the winning hand. He cannot declare his combination of tiles to be a 'Sequence Hand' if another player discards the eight of the Dots tiles. That is, the four point awarded to the Sequence Hand does not count. He can, however, still win the game by virtue of other points he has already scored, by drawing animals for example. But, if he manages to draws the eight of the Dots tiles by himself(自摸\"zì-mō\"), his winning combination is considered to be a 'Sequence Hand'.\n\nThe point here to note is that, a player waiting for either an in-between tile, edge tile (an eight and a nine, waiting for a seven) or a single tile to complete the required pair can only claim a 'Sequence Hand' if he Self-Pick(自摸\"zì-mō\") that particular tile. If he is waiting for any two tiles (a two and a three, waiting for either a one or a four) to complete the winning hand, he can claim these tiles from any party who discards it.\n\nA special situation exists where a player cannot claim a 'Sequence Hand' even if he Self-Pick(自摸\"zì-mō\") the last required tile. This situation happens when a player melded all 4 sequences required by discards from other player, and is left with a single tile. In this event it is clear that he is awaiting that single tile to complete his hand, therefore it cannot be considered a 'Sequence Hand'.\n\nIf a player manages to amass a combination of cards that adheres to the requirements set above, but has drawn flowers \"and/or\" animal tiles, then he can only claim a 'Lesser Sequence Hand'(小平胡\"xiǎo-píng-hù\"/臭平胡\"chòu-píng-hù\"), which awards only 1 point, on top of any points awarded to him by the flower \"and/or\" animal tiles.\n\nA special event known as 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Flower'(花上\"huā-shàng\") scores one point.\n\nThis event happens when a party, who is waiting for a tile to complete his winning hand (also known as the 'Ready Hand'(听牌\"tīng-pái\")), draws a flower \"and/or\" animal. This will require him to replace the drawn flower \"and/or\" animal by drawing a 'Replacement Tile For Flower'(补花\"bǔ-huā\") from the end of the wall. In the event that the tile drawn to replace the flower \"and/or\" animal is the tile needed to complete his winning hand, he is considered to score a 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Flower'(花上\"huā-shàng\"). This event itself is worth one point, as mentioned above, in addition to any points scored by the combination of his winning hand.\n\nThere exists a special event in which a player draws two flower \"and/or\" animal tiles in a row, and upon the second consecutive 'Replacement Tile For Flower'(补花\"bǔ-huā\"), he draws the tile which he requires to complete his winning hand. This event is known as 'Flower on Flower'(花上花\"huā-shàng-huā\"). Some players may choose to consider this as a special event which awards 5 points, but not others. There are also some players who consider each consecutive 'Replacement Tile For Flower'(补花\"bǔ-huā\" ), leading up to a final 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Flower'(花上\"huā-shàng\"), to contribute one additional point each. For example, Player A draws 3 consecutive flower \"and/or\" animal tiles before finally obtaining the tile required for a winning hand on the third 'Replacement Tile For Flower'(补花\"bǔ-huā\"), he will have gotten 3 additional points for 3 consecutive 'Replacement Tile For Flower'(补花\"bǔ-huā\") followed by a 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Flower'(花上\"huā-shàng\"). The point scored for the above special events will have to be agreed upon before the game.\n\nIn any of the above \"huā-shàng\" (花上) event, it is immaterial whether the drawn flower matches the seat number of the player's.\n\nAnother special event known as 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Kong'(杠上\"gàng-shàng\") scores one point.\n\nThis event happens when a party, who is waiting for a tile to complete his winning hand (also known as the 'Ready Hand'(听牌\"tīng-pái\")), either\n\n1) draws a tile which complete a 4-of-a-kind in his hidden hand, in which he can perform an 'Concealed Kong'(暗杠\"àn-gàng\"), or\n\n2) has a 3-of-a-kind in his hidden hand, and any other player discards the last tile of that kind, in which he can perform a 'Exposed Kong'(明杠\"mìng-gàng\"), or\n\n3) has a Pong(碰\"pèng\") triplet exposed, and draws the last tile of that kind himself, in which he can perform a 'Exposed Kong'(明杠\"mìng-gàng\")\n\nAny of the above 3 events will require him to replace the Kong(杠\"gàng\") by performing a by drawing a 'Replacement Tile For Kong'(补杠\"bǔ-gàng\"). In the event that the tile drawn to replace the 'Kong'(杠\"gàng\") is the tile needed to complete his winning hand, he is considered to score a 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Kong'(杠上\"gàng-shàng\"). This will event itself is worth one point, as mentioned above, in addition to any points scored by the combination of his winning hand.\n\n\"Instant payment\" \n\"Note 1\": It is common that an instant payout is given to the party who performs a 'Exposed Kong'(明杠\"mìng-gàng\"), and the payout follows that of a \"yǎo-dào\" (咬到) event. For the performance of an 'Concealed Kong'(暗杠\"àn-gàng\"), it will generally earn double that of the 'Exposed Kong'(明杠\"mìng-gàng\"), just like the event of drawing a cat-mouse-chicken-worm set of tiles.\n\n\"Note 1.1\": However, in the event of a 'Robbing the Kong'(抢杠\"qiǎng-gàng\"), the player who performs the 'Kong'(杠\"gàng\") \"need not\" be compensated, and instead will be the 'guilty' party who is considered to have discarded that tile for the player performing a 'Robbing the Kong'(抢杠\"qiǎng-gàng\"). This event is described in the next section.\n\nA special event can also be triggered from a 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Kong'(杠上\"gàng-shàng\"). The sequence of events is as follows\n\n1) Player A has a concealed triplet in his hand, and any other player discard the last of that tile, or\n\n2) Player A has a concealed triplet in his hand, and he draws the last of that tile himself, or\n\n3) Player A has an exposed triplet, and he draws the last of that tile himself\n\nIn all 3 scenarios above, he is able to perform a 'Kong'(杠\"gàng\") and must perform a 'Replacement Tile For Kong'(补杠\"bǔ-gàng\"). In the event that he draws a tile from this 'Replacement Tile For Kong'(补杠\"bǔ-gàng\"), in which he is already holding on to either\n\n4) a concealed triplet of that tile in his hand, or\n\n5) an exposed triplet of that tile,\n\nhe is then naturally able to perform another Kong(杠\"gàng\") and then another 'Replacement Tile For Kong'(补杠\"bǔ-gàng\"). \"If and only if\" Player A draws a replacement tile (from this particular second-in-a-row 'Replacement Tile For Kong'(补杠\"bǔ-gàng\")) which he is able to complete a winning hand, he is considered to have performed a 'Kong on Kong'(杠杠胡\"gàng-gàng-hú\"). Due to the immense probabilistic difficulty of such a feat, it is generally awarded 10 points, or the \"limit\", whichever is the smaller number.\n\nRobbing the Kong (抢杠\"qiǎng-gàng\") scores one point.\n\nThis event occurs when\n\n1) a playing party has a 'Pong'(碰\"pèng\") triplet exposed,\n\n2) and draws the last tile of that kind himself, and in which he\n\n3) perform an Exposed Kong(明杠\"mìng-gàng\"), and\n\n4) another player, who is waiting for that very last tile of that kind to complete his own winning hand,\n\n5) 'robs' the 'Kong'(杠\"gàng\") to complete his winning hand.\n\nThis exact sequence of events must occur for a 'Robbing the Kong'(抢杠\"qiǎng-gàng\") event to be triggered. Note that 抢杠 can be for any combination in the hand i.e. it does not have to only be 平胡 or 臭平胡) to win.\n\nHowever if there are already 3 same tiles that has been 碰\"pèng\" by player A and player B is waiting for that particular last tile to form his 平胡 hand and this happened to be an in between tile or corner tile (一万&二万 waiting for 三万 or 七筒&九筒 and waiting for 八筒) , 抢杠 will only give the winning player 1 point upon mahjong as the 平胡 rule is not in effect. However if player B is waiting for 2 tiles to form 平胡, a 抢杠 will give him 5 points (4 for 平胡 and 1 for 抢杠).\n\nNote that the other variant of 'Exposed Kong'(明杠\"mìng-gàng\") in which a player calls a \"Kong' from a discarded tile with a triplet in his hidden hand, does not count as 'Robbing the Kong'(抢杠\"qiǎng-gàng\"). The player who requires that last tile can still declare a win(胡\"hù\"), but will not have deemed to have performed a 'Robbing the Kong'(抢杠\"qiǎng-gàng\") event.\n\nThere is a special condition where 'Robbing the Kong' can be used to rob an 'Concealed Kong'(暗杠\"an-gang\"). The condition is that a particular player is waiting for his last tile to complete the \"Thirteen Wonders\"(十三么). This is the only condition where 'Robbing the Kong' can be used to rob an 'Concealed Kong'.\n\n'Winning on the Last Available Tile\" scores 1 point. This event is also known as \"hái-dǐ-lāo-yuè\" (海底捞月). The last available tile is the last 16th un-drawn tile from un-drawn stack.\n\n\"Note 1\": There is a special condition in which \"Winning on the Last Available Tile' \"does not\" trigger the \"hái-dǐ-lāo-yuè\" (海底捞月) event. This condition is fulfilled when the last 16th tile is drawn as a result of a 'Replacement Tile For Flower'(补花\"bǔ-huā\") or 'Replacement Tile For Kong'(补杠\"bǔ-gàng\") event.\n\nExample 1. Player A draws the last 17th tile, which turns out to be a flower. He turn proceeds to perform a 'Replacement Tile For Flower'(补花\"bǔ-huā\") by drawing the last 16th tile. In the event that he wins with that last tile, it will \"not\" be considered \"hái-dǐ-lāo-yuè\" (海底捞月).\n\nExample 2. Player A draws the last 17th tile, which he does not want, and discards it. Player D performs a \"gàng\" (杠), and 'Replacement Tile For Kong'(补杠\"bǔ-gàng\" ) by drawing the last 16th tile. If Player D wins on the last tile, it will \"not\" be considered \"hái-dǐ-lāo-yuè\" (海底捞月).\n\nExample 3. Player A draws the last 18th tile, which turns out to be a flower. He draws a replacement tile, the last 17th tile, and it turns out to be an animal. Finally, he draws the last 16th tile and completes his winning hand. This will \"not\" be considered \"hái-dǐ-lāo-yuè\" (海底捞月).\n\nHowever a special event may have been triggered, depending on the agreement of playing parties. Refer to the above discussions on 'Winning on Replacement Tile'(花上,杠上).\n\n\"Note 2\": In some playing circles, the game is considered a draw if the last 16th tile is a Bonus Tile. No one-time payout will be required, unless the player has gotten 8 flower tiles for the special hand.\n\n\"Note 3:\" In some playing circles, 海底捞月 will only be considered if that tile is 一筒.\n\nA 'Pure Green Suit Hand'(绿一色\"lǜ-yī-sè\") scores four points instead of just two points for Mixed One Suit, due to the increased difficulty. The hand only consist 2,3,4,6 or 8 of the bamboo suit(索子) plus the Green Dragon as a pair or triplet.(Note: As for why it is called Pure Green Suit is that in the early days, all the above tile carvings are painted green.)\n\nThe 'Three Lesser Scholars'(小三元\"xiǎo-sān-yuán\") scores three points (one for the eye pair, and two for the pong/kong of the other two Dragon tiles).\n\nExample 1: \n\nExample 2: \n\nExample 3: \n\nA 'Four Lesser Blessings'(小四喜\"xiǎo-sì-xǐ\") score three or four points (two for the hand itself, plus the bonus points for a pong/kong of the prevailing wind and/or player wind).\n\nExample 1: \n\nA 'Three Great Scholars\"(大三元\"dà-sān-yuán\") scores 10 points, or the \"limit\", whichever is the smaller number.\n\n\"Note 1\" : A common rule in Singapore dictates that any player who collects all 3 triplets of the 3 元 tiles, either by having them in your hidden hand, or by performing Pong(碰\"pèng\") to obtain exposed triplets, can declare himself to have fulfilled the 大三元 combination. The combination of the hidden hands, under this rule, does not matter. Invoking this rule when a player collects all 3 triplets earns that player 5 points, instead of 10.\n\n\"Note 1.1\" : Care must be taken by any player, who invokes the above rule, to conceal their hidden hand while declaring the game to be won. Otherwise, if the hidden hand is revealed, certain players consider this to be cheating, because the said party has not won the game by virtue of his entire hand of tiles, as it should be. If such a situation arise, the winning-turned-losing party must compensate the rest of the playing parties.\n\nA 'Four Great Blessings'(大四喜\"dà-sì-xǐ\") score the \"limit\" (Generally, there appears to be a lack of agreement as to the number of points actually scored by these hands. However, in practice, this combination simply scores the maximum number of points).\n\n\"Note 1\" : For 'Four Great Blessings', a common rule in Singapore dictates that any player who collects all 4 triplets of the 4 individual Wind(风\"fēng\") tiles, either by having them in your hidden hand, or by performing 'Pong'(碰\"pèng\" ) to obtain exposed triplets, can declare himself to have fulfilled the 大四喜 combination. The combination of the hidden hand (more specifically, the last required pair of any tile) under this rule, does not matter. Invoking this rule when a player collects all 4 triplets earns that player 10 points, instead of the \"limit\".\n\n\"Note 1.1\" : Care must be taken by any player, who invokes the above rule, to conceal their hidden hand while declaring the game to be won. Otherwise, if the hidden hand is revealed, certain players consider this to be cheating, because the said party has not won the game by virtue of his entire hand of tiles, as it should be. If such a situation arise, the winning-turned-losing party must compensate the rest of the playing parties.\n\n\n + any tile in the same set\n\nThis winning hand is considered to be one of the hardest to accomplish and therefore has priority to win from a tile from any player's discard, superseding players in front of you who could have gamed from that tile. Thirteen Wonders is the only hand that can snatch a 'Concealed Kong'(暗杠\"àn-gàng\"). Furthermore, it can supersede a self-made winning tile even if the practitioner is waiting for the same card as the self-made winning tile (This only applies to pure Thirteen Wonders). Due to the immense difficulty in assembling this hand, all players pay double that of the limit, regardless if the hand was won on a self-picked (自摸) tile or not.\n\nThis refers to the scenario where the player manages to 'Kong'(杠\"gàng\") four times. It results in the player having 18 tiles excluding flower and animal tiles, hence its name. The player does not need to complete the remaining 2 tiles as the eyes and will be declared winner of the round immediately. It also scores maximum points due to its rarity.\n\nThis refers to the scenario where the first player, as the dealer, wins the round on the first turn (i.e. with the tiles given after dealing and flower/animal/kong any and all etc... replacement needed without draw card). Because of its extreme rarity, this criterion is often awarded the limit.\n\nThis refers to the scenario where a non-dealer wins from the dealer's first discard. Scenario 2 whereby a non-dealer wins upon drawing the first card in the game. Because of its rarity, this criterion is often awarded the limit.\n\nThis refers to the scenario where a non-dealer wins by discard within the first go around of the game before his/her first draw & no exposed meld(except Concealed Kong) formed by anyone. Because of its rarity, this criterion is often awarded the limit.\n\nThis refers to the scenario where you do not eat or pong and draw all the tiles yourself, including the winning tile. This adds one point to your hand.\nNote: Not everybody plays with this rule so it is best to confirm with everybody before commencing your mahjong game.\n\nThis refer to the scenario where the Hand does not conform to any scoring pattern, no value Bonus tile and no value 'Pong'(碰pèng) etc. This Hand used to be played in Singapore but with the introduction of Minimum Point Requirement(起胡\"qǐ-hú\") of one point in Singapore, this Hand has become invalid in most playing circles, perhaps the elderly still play it.\n\nIs there any value in having this Hand at all in Mahjong?\nThis Hand is perhaps the best Defensive Strategy Play against high value hand of your opponent.\n\nEver since the introduction of Minimum Point Requirement(起胡\"qǐ-hú\") of one point in Singapore, the only low value hand is 'Lesser Sequence Hand'(小平胡), but due to many restrictions, it is not an easy hand as well. Perhaps the reason why some players in Singapore started to introduce other low value hand in their playing circle. For example, the Fully Concealed Hand(门清自摸) above.\n\nHigh-risk discards are also an element of Singapore-style scoring, with the player making such a discard paying for the other two losing players, in addition to their own (the other two losing players are vindicated - they do not pay anyone anything). High-risk scenarios only occur when a player is visibly near victory, with that player winning because of a high-risk discard.\n\nThe following is a typical list of high-risk scenarios:\n\nPlayer A has two Dragon Pongs or Kongs exposed. Player B discards a third Dragon and the Player A is able to Pong/Kong it or complete an eye with it (and thereby winning), forming a third set of Dragons. If Player A wins the game with Player B's discard or his own tile, Player B pays all winnings.\n\nExample:\n\nPlayer A's exposed melds:\nHigh-risk discard would be:\nSame as Dragon Tile Set Scenario, but requires three exposed Wind sets and completing a fourth with a discard.\n\nExample:\n\nPlayer A's exposed melds:\nHigh-risk discard would be:\nNOTE: Dragon tiles are also considered high-risk discard:\ndue to the possibility of a 'All Honours Hand'(字一色).\n\nPlayer A has one less than the maximum number of points (typically 4) exposed. Player B discards a Dragon tile, a Prevailing Wind(圈风\"quān-fēng\") or a Player's Seat Wind(门风\"mén-fēng\") that is taken by A, thereby making a total of the maximum number of points (typically 5). If Player A wins the game with Player B's discard or his own tile, Player B pays all winnings. Another unique scenario is where Player A has two less than the maximum number of points (typically 3) exposed. Player B discards the Wind tile that is both the Prevailing Wind and the Player's Seat Wind, that is taken by A, thereby making a total of the maximum number of points (typically 5). If Player A wins the game with Player B's discard or his own tile, Player B pays all winnings. However for the scenario of shooter pay, Player B will only need to pay for all the winnings if Player A 自摸. If Player B discarded Player A's tiles, he would only need to pay for 5 points (as per usual).\n\nExample:\n\nThe limit is 5 points. Player A already has 4 points on his exposed tiles. His seat wind is South and the prevailing Wind is East.\n\nPlayer A's exposed tiles:\nHigh-risk discards:\nPlayer A has 3 or 4 sets of the same suit (bamboo, dots, character or honour) exposed. If Player B discards a tile of the same suit and Player A uses it to win, Player B pays all winnings.\n\nExample:\n\nPlayer A's exposed melds: \n\nHigh-risk discards: Any tile from the same suit as player A's exposed melds.\n\nPlayer A has 3 or 4 sets of the green suit (namely 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 of the bamboo suit, and the Green Dragon) exposed. If Player B discards a tile of in this suit and Player A uses it to win, Player B pays all winnings.\n\nExample:\n\nPlayer A's exposed melds: \n\nHigh-risk discards:\nNote: Most Singaporean players do not recognise this hand as a higher-valued hand, and just treat it like a 'Half Flush Hand'(混一色). In this case, 包绿一色 does not come into effect.\n\nPlayer A has 3 or 4 triplets exposed, all of which are of the terminal number one or nine of any suit. If Player B discards a tile of the terminal number one or nine, and Player A uses it to win, Player B pays for all winnings.\n\nExample:\n\nPlayer A's exposed melds: \n\nHigh-risk discards: \n\nOf course, realistically, the high-risk discards are just since the rest have already appeared in Player A's exposed melds and can't form either the triplet or pair when he goes Mahjong.\n\nWhen Player A has 3 Kongs revealed, and Player B discards a tile that has not appeared anywhere on the table(Discard pool & exposed melds), and if Player A manage to perform the 4th Kong and goes Mahjong, Player B pays for all the winnings.\n\n'Fresh tiles' (生牌\"shēng-pái\") are tiles that have not been discarded.\n\nHowever, exposed tiles from 'Chow'(吃\"chī\") sets are not considered as 'discarded' tiles. For example, if Player C has a 'Chow' (吃\"chī\") set of one-two-three 'Character' (万子\"wàn-zǐ\") exposed, and none other of these three 'Character' (万子\"wàn-zǐ\") tiles are not found in the discard pool, then all these three 'Character' (万子\"wàn-zǐ\") tiles are considered to be 'Fresh' (生\"shēng\") tiles.\n\nAs for 'Pong' (碰\"pèng\") sets are not considered as 'Fresh' (生牌\"shēng-pái\") tile since someone did discard it to allow the set to be melded.\n\nThere appears to be variants of the \"Definition of Fresh\" tile among different players as opposed to the one already mentioned above.\n\nThe variants are:\n\nI.e. to say, if a certain tile is present in one of the melded sets of a player but absent from the discard pool, it will be considered \"fresh\" under the definition of the first variant but not under that of the second variant.\n\nAs mentioned, it will be wise to agree upon the rules with all playing parties before the below two scenarios are triggered.\n\nThere are fewer than 7 tiles remaining in the wall (excluding the last 15 tiles that are meant to be untouched). If Player B discards a 'Fresh'(生牌\"shēng-pái\") tile (one not previously discarded) and Player A performs any Kong(杠\"gàng\") with that discarded tile, Player B pays all the associated compensation that Player A should receive. This has no effect on the payout when the game is won. However, if Player A wins by a 'Winning on Replacement Tile For Kong' (杠上gàng-shàng) from that discard, Player B will be responsible to pay for all players.\n\nThere are fewer than 5 tiles remaining in the wall (excluding the last 15 tiles that are meant to be untouched). If Player B discards a 'Fresh' tile and Player A wins the game with that tile, Player B pays all winnings payable to Player A for the points he has scored. That is, if Player A wins with a 5-point Hand, Player B will compensate Player A with S$64. Players C and D will not be involved in any payment within this scenario. The description of 'Fresh'(生\"shēng\") tiles above applies here.\n\nA simple phrase to help remember the number of the tiles remaining for the 'Fresh' tile discard scenarios is simply \"7 tiles \"Pao Kong\",5 Tiles \"Pao Fresh\"\"(七张包杠,五张包生\"qī-zhang-bāo-gàng,wǔ-zhang-bāo-shēng\").\n\nThere appears to be a variant of the above rule where the number of tiles involved are switched. Thus, for some players, the 'Fresh' Tile Discard Kong Scenario' comes into play when there are less than 5 tiles remaining, while the 'Fresh Discard Scenario' comes into play when there are less than 7 tiles remaining. Thus, the phrase in Note 1 becomes \"7 tiles \"Pao Fresh\",5 Tiles \"Pao Kong\"\"(七张包生,五张包杠). It will be wise to agree upon the rules with all playing parties before the scenarios are triggered.\n\nNote: About the 2 'Fresh' tile discard variants above, which is the original version?\n\nPart of the rule: 5 Tiles 'Pao Fresh'(五张包生) in the first version, is also found in Hong Kong, Taiwanese, South African Mahjong variants etc. This means that it is probably very old and is probably originated from China. As for why the additional 7 tiles 'Pao Kong'(七张包杠) is added in Singapore Mahjong, that is because there is Instant Payment for Kong whereas the above other Mahjong variants don't.\n\nTherefore, \"7 tiles \"Pao Kong\",5 Tiles \"Pao Fresh\"\"(七张包杠, 五张包生) is probably the original version.\n\nIn an event of 'Thirteen Wonders'(十三么), the two above-mentioned 'Fresh' tile discard variants do not apply in the rules.\n\nA scenario where a player claims he has completed his winning hand but in fact, he has not done so or there is a mistake in his hand. This scenario is called Fake or Trick Hand(诈胡\"zhà-hú\").\n\nUsually he will be penalised to pay 5 points or the Limit to the other three players. The discarder will get double, whereas the other two players get the normal rate. If it is the offender that wrongly claim the \"winning tile\" which he drew it himself, i.e.Self-Pick (自摸\"zì-mō\"), then he will pays all the three players double.\n\n\"Note 1:\" Usually the penalty for this scenario is 5 points as most players set the Limit to 5 points, but it will be wise to confirm with all playing parties beforehand regarding the penalty when this scenario arises especially when the Limit is more than 5 points.\n\n\"Note 2:\" In the shooter pay scenario, a player who has wrongly claimed a winning hand will only need to compensate the player who discarded the \"winning\" tile. If he/has has 自摸 the wrong winning tile, he/she will have to compensate everyone the winnings equivalent to 5 points (plus $2).\n\nShort Hand is when the offending player has less than 13 tiles in hand, exposed or concealed (Kong is counted as 3 tiles) .\n\nThe penalty will be the offender has forfeited the right to win for the current hand. However, the offender is still allowed to claim Kong for instant payment because unlike Long Hand, Short Hand reduces the chance of Kong with instant payment.\n\nLong Hand is when the offending player (i) has more than 13 tiles in hand, exposed or concealed (Kong is counted as 3 tiles) and/or (ii) has drawn the wrong tile/s from the wall and/or (iii) melded the wrong discarded tile.\n\nWhen detected by other player, the penalties will be the offender has forfeited the rights to win and to claim any Kong for instant payment for the current hand.\n\nNote: For most Mahjong variants, there is no instant payment for Kong. Therefore, their penalty for Long Hand is only the forfeit of the right to win for the current hand. But for Singapore Mahjong, a mistake that causes Long Hand actually increase the chance of Kong with instant payment, that is why the forfeit of the right to claim any Kong is added here so that the offender will not benefit from his mistake.\n\nSingaporean Mahjong uses the Traditional Prohibition Rules concerning Sacred Discard & Missed Discard.\n\nWhen a player discard a certain tile, it will be the Sacred Discard for that player, because he cannot claim the same identical tile from other players' discards for the win or 'Pong'(碰\"pèng)\" during the very same go around.\n\nFor example, East player discarded a 3 Bamboo without realising that he had a winning hand with 4555 Bamboo. So when South, West or North players discard a 3 Bamboo, he cannot claim it for the win during the very same go around, otherwise it will be considered as a 'Fake Hand'(诈胡zhà-hú)!\n\nBut he can still claim 4 or 6 Bamboo for the win during the very same go around and when his turn comes, he can still 'Self-Pick'(自摸zì-mō) 3 Bamboo to win since in Singaporean Mahjong, one does not need to reveal the 'Self-Pick'(自摸zì-mō) tile.\n\nWhilst the above is the general position, there might be some dispute as to whether the East Player could really claim the 6 Bamboo, as by discarding 3 Bamboo, the other players may likely consider throwing 6 Bamboo as a safe tile. This problem is likely to arise when forming the Sequence Hand (平胡). Hence, it will be wise to agree upon the rules with all playing parties before the scenarios are triggered.\n\nWhen a player misses a chance to claim a certain tile when another player discards it, he cannot claim the same identical tile from the other players' discards for the win or 'Pong'(碰\"pèng)\" during the very same go around.\n\nFor example, East player has 4555 Bamboo in his hand, South player discarded a 3 Bamboo. East player did not claim it. So when West or North players discard the very same 3 Bamboo during the very same go around, East player is prohibited to claim for the win, otherwise it will be considered as a 'Fake Hand'(诈胡zhà-hú)!\n\nBut he can still claim 4 or 6 Bamboo for the win during the very same go around and when his turn comes, he can still 'Self-Pick'(自摸zì-mō) 3 Bamboo to win.\n\nNote: There might be some dispute with the Sacred & Missed Discards especially with \"the very same go around\". For example, East player misses the chance to claim it, that tile should be either the Sacred or Missed Discard for East player.\n\nSo when North player discard a tile that let South player or West Player to 'Pong'(碰\"pèng\") or when West player discard a tile that let South player to 'Pong'(碰\"pèng\"), both scenarios will skip the East player. It should then be a new go around for the East player, so East player could claim the former Sacred or Missed Discard when someone discard it after that.\n\nBut since East player did not draw any tile before that, some argue that the Sacred or Missed Discard should remain. The problem for this argument is that what if East Player was skipped more than one time, it would then be very confusing & argumentative.\n\nUnless the rule is change from \"Sacred & Missed Discards only valid within the very same go around\" to 'Only valid till his next turn\", then the above scenarios, East player is not allowed to claim it.\n\nAs mentioned, it will be wise to agree upon the rules with all playing parties before the scenarios are triggered.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42730079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42730079", "title": "Sonic: After the Sequel", "text": "Sonic: After the Sequel\n\nSonic: After the Sequel is a 2013 platform video game created by Brazilian student Felipe Daneluz (LakeFeperd). It is an unofficial game based on the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series and set between the official games \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog 3\". Daneluz's second \"Sonic\" game, it follows \"Sonic: Before the Sequel\", which set between the original \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2\". Like its predecessor, \"After the Sequel\" stars Sonic the Hedgehog and his sidekick Tails in a quest to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds from Doctor Eggman.\n\n\"After the Sequel\" was inspired by \"Sonic Heroes\" and other games both inside and outside the \"Sonic\" series, and it was developed with Sonic Worlds, an engine based in Multimedia Fusion 2 that reduces the amount of computer programming involved in game creation. It was released as a free download for Microsoft Windows personal computers on June 15, 2013. The game was very well received by video game journalists, who lauded its preservation of retro \"Sonic\" gameplay and its eclectic, 1990s-style soundtrack. The trilogy of \"Before the Sequel\", \"After the Sequel\", and their successor \"Sonic Chrono Adventure\" performed unusually well for fangames, having been downloaded 120,000 times by March 2014.\n\n\"After the Sequel\" is a 2D platformer in the style of the \"Sonic\" games for the Sega Genesis. As such, it lets the player control either the blue hedgehog Sonic or his orange fox friend Tails. Both characters can move left and right with the arrow keys and jump with the \"Z\" key; Tails can also fly to reach areas Sonic cannot. The game takes place in seven levels, known as zones, each divided into three acts followed by a boss fight with Doctor Eggman. These zones are designed for fast-paced gameplay, featuring typical \"Sonic\" obstacles such as bottomless pits and vertical loops. The zones are based on various themes, including haunted houses, cities, magma caverns, winter theme parks, and sugar processing plants.\n\nThe player collects rings in zones and boss fights as a form of health: upon being hit by an enemy or harmful obstacle, the player's rings will scatter and can be recollected. Being hit while carrying no rings, being crushed by an obstacle, or falling into a bottomless pit causes the player to lose a life; running out of lives results in a game over screen, after which the player must restart the zone from act one. Conversely, collecting 100 rings gets the player an extra life, and completing an act with 50 takes the player to a special stage, where they can collect rings for extra lives. The game also features power-ups throughout its zones, which are activated with the \"X\" key: these include typical \"Sonic\" power-ups such as shields and extra lives, as well as new ones. The \"Beam\" power-up for Sonic and the \"Mirror\" power-up for Tails are borrowed from and credited to Nintendo's \"Kirby\" series.\n\nAt the end of \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2\", Sonic and Tails fly over the ocean in Tails' biplane, the Tornado, after defeating Doctor Eggman. Beginning from this point, \"After the Sequel\" depicts Sonic and Tails noticing a forested island and deciding to make a landing and explore. After completing the first zone, Sonic finds a robot resembling Tails—a trap sprung by Eggman. The robot ensnares Sonic in a forcefield while Eggman steals Sonic's Chaos Emeralds. Sonic escapes and sets out with Tails to recover the Emeralds.\n\nThe two travel through more zones and fight Eggman at the end of each one. They follow Eggman to a forest, where he leads a massive logging operation. Together with Mighty the Armadillo, they destroy his machinery and stop the operation. They continue through the forest and find ghosts that frighten Tails. Destroying one of Eggman's robots lets Sonic see its internal architecture, including a screen that shows Eggman's plans to create an empire and drop a floating island into the sea.\n\nIn Parhelion Peak, the game's snow zone, Sonic and Tails notice a feather float down from the sky. They board another of Eggman's airships and complete another zone, whereupon they find another feather. They trace the feathers to Eggman's bird-like robot, which is guarding the Emeralds. Sonic retrieves the Emeralds and uses them to become Super Sonic. He fights the robot as the game's final boss. After its defeat, Sonic and Tails fly aboard the Tornado once more—the segue into the events of \"Sonic the Hedgehog 3\".\n\n\"After the Sequel\" was created by Felipe Daneluz (known on the Internet as \"LakeFeperd\"), a student from São Paulo, Brazil. Unlike many longtime \"Sonic\" fans, Daneluz remained supportive of the series through its \"dark age\" in the mid to late 2000s and enjoyed games such as \"Sonic Riders\". Because of his continued enthusiasm toward later \"Sonic\" games, Daneluz decided to create a retro-styled \"Sonic\" game. Not being well versed in computer programming, Daneluz took to the open-source, visual game engine Sonic Worlds, which is tailored to create \"Sonic\" zones within the program Multimedia Fusion 2. Determined to make his game stand out despite his limited technical proficiency, Daneluz decided to set his first game in the time between \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" and \"Sonic 2\", calling it \"Sonic: Before the Sequel\". He set the follow-up, entitled \"Sonic: After the Sequel\", between \"Sonic 2\" and \"Sonic 3, \"and a third installment, \"Sonic Chrono Adventure,\" between \"Sonic 3\" and \"Sonic CD\".\n\n\"After the Sequel\"s zones were inspired largely by those of \"Sonic Heroes\". One level called RedHot Ride Zone, however, was based mainly on a level of the same name in \"\". Ideas for other zones came from \"Sonic Riders\" and a \"Sonic\"-style song called \"Combat Night Zone\" by electronic artist MaxieDaMan. Daneluz imagined Sonic being high on sugar in the Sugar Splash Zone. Daneluz began creating each level by sketching out ideas on paper, then transferring them to Adobe Photoshop before working on the enemies and level design. Unlike the publishers of many other games on which fangames have been based, particularly Nintendo, \"Sonic\" series publisher Sega has not sent a cease and desist order or other indication of disapproval to Daneluz. He has speculated that the company does not want to upset its fanbase.\n\nThe music composition and recording were handled by underground musicians Falk Au Yeong, Funk Fiction, Andy Tunstall, James Landino, DJ Max-E, Mr. Lange, and Li Xiao'an. Daneluz had not made plans to incorporate original music until Falk approached him requesting collaboration on the game. Funk Fiction has claimed that the music spans more than twenty genres and was influenced by rock, jazz, disco, and trip hop and the soundtracks of game franchises like \"Sonic\", \"Donkey Kong\", and \"Kirby\". Due to the levels in \"After the Sequel\" generally taking longer to complete than those in \"Before the Sequel\", the music tracks are longer, estimated by Falk as ranging from one minute and 45 seconds to three minutes.\n\nIn August 2017, Daneluz re-released the game as \"Sonic: After the Sequel DX\". This version features improved pyhsics, the addition of the drop dash from \"Sonic Mania\", and a new final boss.\n\n\"After the Sequel\" has received positive coverage for its revitalization of retro \"Sonic\" gameplay. Tony Ponce of Destructoid summarized it as \"quite the fun little gem that keeps the Genesis-era Sonic spirit alive\". He contrasted the retro, fan-made \"After the Sequel\" with Sega's efforts to create high-quality 3D titles, lamenting that, fifteen years after the release of \"Sonic Adventure\", Sega was \"only \"now\" starting to get the hang of the third dimension.\" John Polson from IndieGames.com called the game \"fantastic\" and \"stunning\", while Kotaku's András Neltz stated that \"it looks amazing\" and advised readers not to let the game's status as a fan work turn them away from it. Nintendo Life writer Damien McFerran also called the game \"impressive\". The UK gaming staff for Red Bull's website stated that, despite Sega's continual releases of \"Sonic\" games, \"few have quite recaptured the thrill of blazing through a 2D labyrinth at lightspeed in the way that fan made \"Sonic After The Sequel\" has.\" A second Red Bull article, by author Ben Sillis, exclaimed that \"you have to play\" it.\n\nThe game's music has been particularly well received. Ponce called it \"the best music ever\" and \"simply indescribable\", opining that it raised an already high-quality product \"to god tier\". Ponce wrote an article dedicated to the game's music two days later, clarifying that it equals or surpasses the quality of any other \"Sonic\" game's soundtrack. The more reserved Polson claimed that the music \"definitely rocks\" and is clearer than that of Genesis games. Similarly, the Red Bull staff called the music \"absolutely stunning\", likening it to gaming soundtracks of the early 1990s. For McFerran, the soundtrack was \"just as noteworthy\" as the rest of the game.\n\nThe game is available as a free download for Windows personal computers. As of March 2014, the trilogy had been downloaded 120,000 times—an unusually high number for fangames—as compared to the 640,000 copies of the official game \"Sonic Lost World\" (also released in 2013) sold on the Wii U by the same time.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4865290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4865290", "title": "The Kransky Sisters", "text": "The Kransky Sisters\n\nThe Kransky Sisters are an Australian musical comedy trio created, written and performed by Annie Lee (Mourne) and Christine Johnston (Eve) initially with Michele Watt (Arva – 2000 til 2006) and later with Carolyn Johns (Dawn – 2007 onwards). They regularly appeared on \"In Siberia Tonight\" on SBS Television, \"The Sideshow\" with Paul McDermott on ABC Television and had guest appearances on \"Spicks and Specks\" and \"Adam Hills Tonight\".\n\nDuring their act, the Kransky Sisters tell off-beat, macabre stories accompanied by cover versions of popular songs. The fictional sisters live an old-fashioned life style and travel in a 1958 Morris Major between performances. The trio's members play tuba, guitar, musical saw and a 1960s reed keyboard, as well as bizarre instruments such as toilet brushes and kitchen pots.\n\nThe Kransky Sisters were created by Annie Lee and Christine Johnston in Brisbane in 2000. Johnston grew up in Geebung, she provides \"experimental vocals, including bird calls, and uses her voice as a medium by which visual objects and the subliminal or pedestrian aspects of human experience can be interpreted. In combination with this interest [she] brings to her performances a dramatic visual component and a strong sense of personal style and humour.\"\n\nLeah Mercer of \"RealTime Arts\" caught their performance of \"Baggage\" in November 2005, she described \"their earnest delivery and spot-on arrangements mean that the [trio] never descend into cheap parody; they play for laughs but never at their characters’ expense. Full of memorable moments (Talking Heads' 'Psycho Killer', complete with yodeling and some wild Salvation Army tambourine moves, tops my list) \"Baggage\" unfolds as a series of stories gathered during the Kransky’s recent tour of regional Queensland. Continuing that great Australian tradition of the misfit hero.\"\n\nThe Kransky sisters come from Esk, a real rural town in Queensland. The two eldest sisters, Mourne and Eve Kransky, are full biological sisters and have lived together all their lives. Mourne and Eve's father was a travelling salesman for the (fictional) Asbestos Cookware Company. Their mother left their father to be with his brother, who is Arva and Dawn's father. The two brothers have not spoken since and Mourne and Eve ostracise Arva and Dawn, using their guilt over the affair to dominate them.\n\nArva, who first toured with the family band, has now joined the Hornbell Military Marching Band. Dawn, the youngest sister, has taken leave from her job as trolley librarian at the Esk Hospital and now tours in Arva's place. The sisters wear the same clothes and Mourne and Eve speak with similar mannerisms. Mourne, the eldest, is clearly the matriarch, sternly keeping control of her younger sisters and doing most of the speaking during a concert, while Eve, a vegetarian who harbours secret passions, eerily echoes many of Mourne's phrases, though she has enough independence to occasionally add to Mourne's stories. Arva and Dawn almost never speak.\n\nThe songs they play are learnt from listening to the \"wireless\" and they drive to their concerts in a 1958 Morris Major. Sometimes the songs are incomplete thanks to an interruption in their reception and the sisters, lacking any normal cultural context, often seem not to fully understand what they are singing about.\n\nOne of their neighbours has a computer and has made their official website for them.\n\n\n\nNominations\n\n\n\nAnnie Lee and Christine Johnston had separate roles in a comedy, cabaret presentation, \"Women in Voice\" (WIV), in September 2007 at Brisbane's Playhouse. Lee was the MC, who according to Erin White of \"Australian Stage\" \"captures the audience with her expressive face and amazing large, bright eyes. Her intermittent songs about dreams and the vastness of the universe, evidently project the WIV desire for women (and men) to follow their dreams and make their own destiny.\" White observed that Johnston \"performs dressed as an old school teacher; sings the Latin word for Tomato; and breaks out to 'What I Like About You', before performing her signature act – playing the musical saw. The haunting and ringing sound of the saw compliments [her] obscure persona. Her performance is stilted and disjointed, yet suits the character she is playing.\"\n\nIn June 2013 Johnston and two assistants, Peter Nelson and Lisa O'Neill, performed in a side project, 'RRamp - the Collector, the Archivist & the Electrocrat' , at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival. Mick Searles of AussieTheatre.com described the show, \"Johnston sings skewed stories about chickens, tax receipts, scabs, kitchen utensils and her love of collecting and keeping things in jars (including skin from a suntan in 1978) in a wacky musical comedy.\" From 2002 the trio of Johnston, Nelson and O'Neill have worked as the Gingham Family to perform a children's musical comedy, \"Fluff: A Story of Lost Toys\".\n\nJohnston appeared as The Old Woman in Opera Queensland's (OQ) 2015 staged production of Leonard Bernstein's operetta \"Candide\", directed by Lindy Hume. In 2017, Johnston played Mad Margaret in OQ's production of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Ruddigore\".\n\nAnnie Lee performed a solo set of shows, \"Barefoot Cabaret\", in June 2015 providing \"a night of gorgeous European cabaret with classics by everyone from Kurt Weill to Bertolt Brecht.\" In another of Annie Lee's Cabaret shows 'Lighthouse Berlin' Lee performs a personal tribute to the extraordinary life of cabaret legend and friend Agnes Bernelle (1923-1999). In July 2015 Jack Beeby of Aussie Theatre writes \"this beautifully fond and personal tribute to one of the last direct links to Weimar Germany… Lee recounts the details of Bernelle’s extraordinary life.\"\nKransky Sisters collaborated with a five-piece classical music ensemble, Topology, in January 2016 to present a combined show which \"sees the assembled performers take on scores and songs, including well-known themes from \"Star Trek\", \"Harry Potter\" and \"Downton Abbey\".\"\n\n"}
{"id": "76630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76630", "title": "The Wild Bunch", "text": "The Wild Bunch\n\nThe Wild Bunch is a 1969 American epic Western film directed by Sam Peckinpah about an aging outlaw gang on the Mexico–United States border trying to adapt to the changing modern world of 1913. The film was controversial because of its graphic violence and its portrayal of crude men attempting to survive by any available means.\n\nThe screenplay was written by Peckinpah and Walon Green. It stars William Holden, Robert Ryan, Ernest Borgnine, Edmond O'Brien, Ben Johnson, and Warren Oates. It was filmed in Mexico, notably at the Hacienda Ciénaga del Carmen, deep in the desert between Torreón and Saltillo, Coahuila, and on the Rio Nazas. It was filmed in Technicolor and Panavision. \n\n\"The Wild Bunch\" is noted for intricate, multi-angle, quick-cut editing using normal and slow motion images, a revolutionary cinema technique in 1969. The writing of Green, Peckinpah, and Roy N. Sickner was nominated for a best-screenplay Academy Award, and the music by Jerry Fielding was nominated for Best Original Score. Additionally, Peckinpah was nominated for an Outstanding Directorial Achievement award by the Directors Guild of America, and cinematographer Lucien Ballard won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Cinematography.\n\nIn 1999, the U.S. National Film Registry selected it for preservation in the Library of Congress as culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant. The film was ranked 80th in the American Film Institute's 100 best American films and the 69th most thrilling film. In 2008, the AFI listed 10 best films in 10 genres, ranking \"The Wild Bunch\" as the sixth-best Western.\n\nIn Texas in 1913, Pike Bishop, the leader of a gang of aging outlaws, is seeking retirement with one final score: the robbery of a railroad office containing a cache of silver. They are ambushed by Pike's former partner, Deke Thornton, who is leading a posse of bounty hunters hired and deputized by the railroad. A bloody shootout kills several of the gang. Pike uses a serendipitous temperance union parade to shield their getaway, and many citizens are killed in the crossfire.\n\nPike rides off with Dutch Engstrom, brothers Lyle and Tector Gorch, and Angel, the only survivors. They are dismayed when the loot from the robbery turns out to be a decoy: steel washers instead of silver coin. The men reunite with old-timer Freddie Sykes and head for Mexico.\n\nPike's men cross the Rio Grande and take refuge that night in the village where Angel was born. The townsfolk are ruled by General Mapache, a corrupt, brutal officer in the Mexican Federal Army, who has been ravaging the area's villages to feed his troops, who have been losing to the forces of revolutionary Pancho Villa. Pike's gang makes contact with the general. A jealous Angel spots Teresa, his former lover, in Mapache's arms and shoots her dead, angering Mapache. Pike defuses the situation and offers to work for Mapache. Their task is to steal a weapons shipment from a U.S. Army train so that Mapache can resupply his troops and appease Commander Mohr, his German military adviser, who wishes to obtain samples of America's armaments. The reward will be a cache of gold coins.\n\nAngel gives up his share of the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and ammunition to a band of rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Deke's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed. The posse chases them to the Mexican border, only to be foiled again as the robbers blow up a trestle spanning the Rio Grande, dumping the entire posse into the river. The pursuers temporarily regroup at a riverside camp and then quickly take off again after the Bunch.\n\nPike and his men, knowing they risk being double-crossed by Mapache, devise a way of bringing him the stolen weapons without him double-crossing them. However, Mapache learns from the mother of Teresa that Angel stole a crate of guns and ammo, and reveals this as Angel and Engstrom deliver the last of the weapons. Surrounded by Mapache's army, Angel desperately tries to escape, only to be captured and tortured. Mapache lets Engstrom go, and he rejoins Pike's gang and tells them what happened.\n\nSykes is wounded by Deke's posse while securing spare horses. The rest of Pike's gang returns to Agua Verde for shelter, where a bacchanal celebrating the weapons transfer has commenced; they see Angel being dragged on the ground by a rope tied behind the general's car. After a brief frolic with prostitutes and a period of reflection, Pike and the gang try to forcibly persuade Mapache to release Angel, who by then was barely alive after the torture. The general appears to comply; however, as they watch, the general instead cuts Angel's throat. Pike and Engstrom angrily gun Mapache down in front of his men. For a moment, the \"federales\" are so shocked that they fail to return fire, causing Engstrom to laugh in surprise. Pike calmly takes aim at Mohr and kills him, too. This results in a violent, bloody shootout—dominated by the machine gun—in which Pike and his men are killed, along with most of Mapache's present troops and the remaining German adviser.\n\nDeke finally catches up. He allows the remaining members of the posse to take the bullet-riddled bodies of the gang members back and collect the reward, while electing to stay behind, knowing what awaits the posse. After a period, Sykes arrives with a band of the previously seen Mexican rebels, who have killed off what's left of the posse along the way. Sykes asks Deke to come along and join the revolution. Deke smiles and rides off with them.\n\nPeckinpah considered many actors for the Pike Bishop role before casting William Holden, including Richard Boone, Sterling Hayden, Charlton Heston, Burt Lancaster, Lee Marvin, Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck, and James Stewart. Marvin actually accepted the role but pulled out after he was offered more money to star in \"Paint Your Wagon\" (1969).\n\nPeckinpah's first two choices for the role of Deke Thornton were Richard Harris (who had co-starred in \"Major Dundee\") and Brian Keith (who had worked with Peckinpah on \"The Westerner\" (1960) and \"The Deadly Companions\" (1961)). Harris was never formally approached; Keith was asked, but he turned it down. Robert Ryan was ultimately cast in the part after Peckinpah saw him in the World War II action movie \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967). Other actors considered for the role were Henry Fonda, Glenn Ford, Van Heflin, Ben Johnson (later cast as Tector Gorch), and Arthur Kennedy.\n\nThe role of Mapache went to Emilio Fernández, the Mexican film director, writer, actor, and friend of Peckinpah. Among those considered to play Dutch Engstrom were Charles Bronson, Jim Brown, Alex Cord, Robert Culp, Sammy Davis Jr., Richard Jaeckel, Steve McQueen, and George Peppard. Ernest Borgnine was cast based on his performance in \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967). Robert Blake was the original choice to play Angel, but he asked for too much money. Peckinpah was impressed with Jaime Sánchez in Sidney Lumet's film adaptation of \"The Pawnbroker\" and demanded that he be cast as Angel.\n\nStage actor Albert Dekker was cast as Harrigan the railroad detective. \"The Wild Bunch\" was his last film, as he died just months after its final scenes were completed. Bo Hopkins had only a few television credits on his resume when he played the part of Clarence \"Crazy\" Lee. Warren Oates played Lyle Gorch, having previously worked with Peckinpah on the TV series \"The Rifleman\" and his previous films \"Ride the High Country\" (1962) and \"Major Dundee\" (1965).\n\nIn 1967, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts producers Kenneth Hyman and Phil Feldman were interested in having Sam Peckinpah rewrite and direct an adventure film called \"The Diamond Story\". A professional outcast due to the production difficulties of his previous film \"Major Dundee\" (1965) and his firing from the set of \"The Cincinnati Kid\" (1965), Peckinpah's stock had improved following his critically acclaimed work on the television film \"Noon Wine\" (1966). An alternative screenplay available at the studio was \"The Wild Bunch\", written by Roy Sickner and Walon Green. At the time, William Goldman's screenplay \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" had recently been purchased by 20th Century Fox. It was quickly decided that \"The Wild Bunch\", which had several similarities to Goldman's work, would be produced in order to beat \"Butch Cassidy\" to the theaters.\n\nBy the fall of 1967, Peckinpah was rewriting the screenplay and preparing for the production. The principal photography was shot entirely on location in Mexico, most notably at the Hacienda Ciénaga del Carmen (deep in the desert between Torreón and Saltillo, Coahuila) and on the Rio Nazas. Peckinpah's epic work was inspired by his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in Arthur Penn's \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (1967), and America's growing frustration with the Vietnam War and what he perceived to be the utter lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time. He set out to make a film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period, but as well the crude men attempting to survive the era. Multiple scenes attempted in \"Major Dundee\", including slow motion action sequences (inspired by Akira Kurosawa's work in \"Seven Samurai\" (1954)), characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, would become fully realized in \"The Wild Bunch\".\nThe film was shot with the anamorphic process. Peckinpah and his cinematographer, Lucien Ballard, also made use of telephoto lenses, that allowed for objects and people in both the background and foreground to be compressed in perspective. The effect is best seen in the shots where the Bunch makes the walk to Mapache's headquarters to free Angel. As they walk forward, a constant flow of people passes between them and the camera; most of the people in the foreground are as sharply focused as the Bunch. The editing of the film is notable in that shots from multiple angles were spliced together in rapid succession, often at different speeds, placing greater emphasis on the chaotic nature of the action and the gunfights.\n\nLou Lombardo, having previously worked with Peckinpah on \"Noon Wine\", was personally hired by the director to edit \"The Wild Bunch\". Peckinpah had wanted an editor who would be loyal to him. Lombardo's youth was also a plus, as he was not bound by traditional conventions. One of Lombardo's first contributions was to show Peckinpah an episode of the TV series \"Felony Squad\" he edited in 1967. The episode, entitled \"My Mommy Got Lost\", included a slow motion sequence where Joe Don Baker is shot by the police. The scene mixed slow motion with normal speed, having been filmed at 24 frames per second but triple printed optically at 72 frames per second. Peckinpah was reportedly thrilled and told Lombardo: \"Let's try some of that when we get down to Mexico!\" The director would film the major shootouts with six cameras, operating at various film rates, including 24 frames per second, 30 frames per second, 60 frames per second, 90 frames per second, and 120 frames per second. When the scenes were eventually cut together, the action would shift from slow to fast to slower still, giving time an elastic quality never before seen in motion pictures up to that time.\n\nBy the time filming wrapped, Peckinpah had shot of film with 1,288 camera setups. Lombardo and Peckinpah remained in Mexico for six months editing the picture. After initial cuts, the opening gunfight sequence ran 21 minutes. By cutting frames from specific scenes and intercutting others, they were able to fine-cut the opening robbery down to five minutes. The creative montage became the model for the rest of the film and would \"forever change the way movies would be made\". Further editing was done to secure a favorable rating from the MPAA which was in the process of establishing a new set of codes. Peckinpah and his editors cut the film to satisfy the new, expansive R-rating parameters which, for the first time, designated a film as being unsuitable for children. Without this new system in place, the film could not have been released with its explicit images of bloodshed.\n\nPeckinpah stated that one of his goals for this movie was to give the audience \"some idea of what it is to be gunned down\". A memorable incident occurred, to that end, as Peckinpah's crew were consulting him on the \"gunfire\" effects to be used in the film. Not satisfied with the results from the squibs his crew had brought for him, Peckinpah became exasperated; he finally hollered: \"That's not what I want! \"That's not what I want!\"\" He then grabbed a real revolver and fired it into a nearby wall. The gun empty, Peckinpah barked at his stunned crew: \"THAT'S the effect I want!!\" He also had the gunfire sound effects changed for the film. Before, all gunshots in Warner Bros. movies sounded identical, regardless of the type of weapon being fired. Peckinpah insisted on each different type of firearm having its own specific sound effect when fired.\n\nCritics of \"The Wild Bunch\" noted the theme of the end of the outlaw gunfighter era. Pike Bishop says, \"We've got to start thinking beyond our guns. Those days are closing fast.\" The Bunch live by an anachronistic code of honor without a place in 20th-century society. When they inspect Gen. Mapache's new automobile, they perceive it marks the end of horse travel, a symbol also in Peckinpah's \"Ride the High Country\" (1962) and \"The Ballad of Cable Hogue\" (1970).\n\nThe violence that was much criticized in 1969 remains controversial. Peckinpah noted it was allegoric of the American war in Vietnam, the violence of which was nightly televised to American homes at supper time. He tried showing the gun violence commonplace to the historic western frontier period, rebelling against sanitized, bloodless television Westerns and films glamorizing gunfights and murder: \"The point of the film is to take this façade of movie violence and open it up, get people involved in it so that they are starting to go in the Hollywood television predictable reaction syndrome, and then twist it so that it's not fun anymore, just a wave of sickness in the gut ... it's ugly, brutalizing, and bloody awful; it's not fun and games and cowboys and Indians. It's a terrible, ugly thing, and yet there's a certain response that you get from it, an excitement, because we're all violent people.\" Peckinpah used violence as a catharsis, believing his audience would be purged of violence by witnessing it explicitly on screen. He later admitted to being mistaken, that the audience came to enjoy rather than be horrified by his films' violence, something that troubled him.\n\nBetrayal is the secondary theme of \"The Wild Bunch\". The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate, thus violating their own honor code when it suits them (\"$10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties\"). However, Bishop says, \"When you side with a man, you stay with him, and if you can't do that you're like some animal.\" Such oppositional ideas lead to the film's violent conclusion, as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable. Bishop remembers his betrayals, most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton (in flashback) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery (ostensibly to guard the hostages). Critic David Weddle writes that \"like that of Conrad's \"Lord Jim\", Pike Bishop's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish.\"\n\nVincent Canby began his review by calling the film \"very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years. It's also so full of violence—of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story—that it's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence (as I do not) to write automatic condemnations of it.\" He said, \"Although the movie's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos, corruption, and defeat\". Among the actors, he commented particularly on William Holden: \"After years of giving bored performances in boring movies, Holden comes back gallantly in \"The Wild Bunch\". He looks older and tired, but he has style, both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he's always done, not because he really wants the money but because there's simply nothing else to do.\" \"Time\" also liked Holden's performance, describing it as his best since \"Stalag 17\" (a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar); said Robert Ryan gave \"the screen performance of his career\"; and concluded that \"\"The Wild Bunch\" contains faults and mistakes\" (such as flashbacks \"introduced with surprising clumsiness\"), but \"its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah, along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn, belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers.\"\n\nIn a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert, who \"saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969, during the golden age of the junket, when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters\", said that back then he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket's press conference, prompted by comments from \"a reporter from the \"Reader's Digest\" [who] got up to ask 'Why was this film ever made?'\" He compared the film to \"Pulp Fiction\": \"praised and condemned with equal vehemence.\"\n\n\"What \"Citizen Kane\" was to movie lovers in 1941, \"The Wild Bunch\" was to cineastes in 1969,\" wrote film critic Michael Sragow, adding that Peckinpah had \"produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa: the Gotterdammerung of Westerns\".\n\nProduced on a budget of $6 million, the film grossed $10.5 million at the US box office in 1970 and another $638,641 in the US on its 1995 restored box-office release, making a total of $11,138,641. It was the 17th highest-grossing film of 1969. Today, the film holds a 94% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 51 critics.\n\nSam Peckinpah and the making of \"The Wild Bunch\" were the subjects of the documentary \"\" (1996) directed and edited by Paul Seydor; the documentary was occasioned by the discovery of 72 minutes of silent, black-and-white film footage of Peckinpah and company on location in northern Mexico during the filming of \"The Wild Bunch\". Michael Sragow wrote in 2000 that the documentary was \"a wonderful introduction to Peckinpah’s radically detailed historical film about American outlaws in revolutionary Mexico--a masterpiece that’s part bullet-driven ballet, part requiem for Old West friendship and part existential explosion. Seydor’s movie is also a poetic flight on the myriad possibilities of movie directing.\" Seydor and his co-producer Nick Redman were nominated in 1997 for the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject).\n\nFollowing its release, Peckinpah was one of ten directors to receive a nomination for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film. The film received two Academy Award nominations, for Best Original Screenplay (Walon Green, Roy N. Sickner, Sam Peckinpah) and Best Original Music Score (Jerry Fielding). At the 42nd Academy Awards ceremony, both awards went to crew members of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (screenwriter William Goldman and composer Burt Bacharach). Cinematographer Lucien Ballard won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Cinematography.\n\nDecades later the American Film Institute placed the film in several of its \"100 Years\" lists:\n\nThe film is ranked #94 on \"Empire\" magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Films of All Time. In 1999, the U.S. National Film Registry selected it for preservation in the Library of Congress as culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant. In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed \"The Wild Bunch\" as the 23rd best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership.\n\nIn 1993, Warner Bros. resubmitted the film to the MPAA ratings board prior to an expected re-release. To the studio's surprise, the originally R-rated film was given an NC-17, delaying the release until the decision was appealed. The controversy was linked to 10 extra minutes added to the film, although none of this footage contained graphic violence. Warner Bros. trimmed some footage to decrease the running time to ensure additional daily screenings. When the restored film finally made it to the screen in March 1995, one reviewer noted:\n\nBy restoring 10 minutes to the film, the complex story now fits together in a seamless way, filling in those gaps found in the previous theatrical release, and proving that Peckinpah was firing on all cylinders for this, his grandest achievement. ... And the one overwhelming feature that the director's cut makes unforgettable are the many faces of the children, whether playing, singing, or cowering, much of the reaction to what happens on-screen is through the eyes, both innocent and imitative, of all the children.\n\nToday, almost all of the versions of the film include the missing scenes. Warner Bros. released a newly restored version in a two-disc special edition on January 10, 2006. It includes an audio commentary by Peckinpah scholars, two documentaries concerning the making of the film, and never-before-seen outtakes.\n\nThere have been several versions of the film:\n\nOn January 19, 2011, it was announced by Warner Bros. that a remake of \"The Wild Bunch\" was in the works. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland was hired to develop a new script. The 2012 suicide of Tony Scott, who was scheduled to direct, put the project in limbo.\n\nOn May 15, 2013, \"The Wrap\" reported that Will Smith was in talks to star in and produce the remake. The new version involves drug cartels and follows a disgraced DEA agent who assembles a team to go after a Mexican drug lord and his fortune. No director has been chosen, and a new screenwriter is being sought.\n\nIn 2015 a Hollywood insider website announced that Jonathan Jakubowicz was set to write and direct a remake. \"Our sources also tell us that the remake will update the story to a contemporary setting, revolving around the CIA, dangerous drug cartels, and a thrilling heist against the backdrop of the Southern California-Mexico border. Jakubowicz will be working from previous drafts submitted by David Ayer and Brian Helgeland.\"\n\nIn 2018, Mel Gibson was announced to co-write and direct a new version of \"The Wild Bunch\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "71470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71470", "title": "Two-up", "text": "Two-up\n\nTwo-up is a traditional Australian gambling game, involving a designated \"spinner\" throwing two coins or pennies into the air. Players bet on whether the coins will fall with both heads (obverse) up, both tails (reverse) up, or with one coin a head and one a tail (known as \"Ewan\"). It is traditionally played on Anzac Day in pubs and clubs throughout Australia, in part to mark a shared experience with Diggers through the ages.\n\nThe game is traditionally played with pennies – their weight, size, and surface design make them ideal for the game. Weight and size make them stable on the \"kip\" and easy to spin in the air. Decimal coins are generally considered to be too small and light and they don't fly so well. The design of pre-1939 pennies had the sovereign's head on the obverse (front) and the reverse was totally covered in writing making the result very easy and quick to see. Pennies now are marked with a white cross on the reverse (Tails) side. Pennies can often be observed being used at games on Anzac Day, as they are brought out specifically for this purpose each year.\n\nThe exact origins of two-up are obscure, but it seems to have evolved from pitch and toss, a gambling game involving tossing a single coin into the air and wagering on the result. Two-up was popular amongst poorer English and Irish citizens in the 18th century.\n\nThe predilection of the convicts for this game was noted as early as 1798 by New South Wales's first judge advocate, as well as the lack of skill involved and the large losses. By the 1850s, the two-coin form was being played on the goldfields of the eastern colonies, and it spread across the country following subsequent gold rushes. \n\nTwo-up was played extensively by Australia's soldiers during World War I. Gambling games, to which a blind eye was cast, became a regular part of Anzac Day celebrations for returned soldiers, although two-up was illegal at all other times.\n\nAs time passed, increasingly elaborate illegal \"two-up schools\" grew around Australia, to the consternation of authorities but with the backing of corrupt police. The legendary Thommo's Two-up School, which operated at various locations in Surry Hills, Sydney from the early years of the 20th century until at least 1979, was one of Australia's first major illegal gambling operations.\n\nThe popularity of two-up declined after the 1950s as more sophisticated forms of gambling like baccarat gained popularity in illegal gaming houses and poker machines (slot machines) were legalised in clubs.\n\nLegal two-up arrived with its introduction as a table game at the new casino in Hobart in 1973, but is now only offered at Crown Perth and Crown Melbourne. Two-up has also been legalised on Anzac Day, when it is played in Returned Servicemen's League (RSL) clubs and hotels. Several tourist \"two-up schools\" in the Outback have also been legalised. Under the NSW Gambling (Two-Up) Act 1998, playing two-up in NSW is not unlawful on Anzac Day.\n\nThe table below show the current bets that can be made at Crown Perth.\n\nA person is selected as the spinner (generally greeted to loud calls of \"Come in spinner!\" from the rest of the players). The spinner tosses the coins in the air using the kip until they win or lose.\n\nThe basic format of the game:\n\nThe spinner is required to place a bet (which must be on heads) before their first throw which must be covered (equalled) by another player. If the spinner wins they keep the bet and cover, otherwise it goes to the player who covered the bet. The boxer takes a commission out of this bet.\n\nThe other members of the group place side bets (bets against each other) on whether the spinner will win or lose and the result of the next throw.\n\nVariations revolve around the definition of \"win\" and \"lose\" for the spinner. Some variations include:\n\nWhen played in casinos the spinner's bet is covered by the house, as are the side-bets by the group of punters.\n\nSometimes three coins are used and the bet then is against the spinner who must head them \"I bet they tail 'em\" rather than \"odds em\".\n\nOn 17 November 2004, the Premier of New South Wales remarked in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly:\n\nIn 1978, the Australian group the Little River Band released \"Sleeper Catcher\", their fourth album. In the liner notes it says:\n\nThe Australian rock group AC/DC has a song called \"Two's Up\" on their 1988 Blow Up Your Video album that references the game.\n\nThe film \"The Sundowners\" contains a sequence in which a group of Australian drovers, including Robert Mitchum's character, play a game of two-up, with appropriate bets. One of the players calls out \"fair go\", which translates roughly as \"play fair\". Appropriately, the action in the game on-screen is rapid and without hesitations or false starts. A similar sequence can be found in the 1971 film \"Wake in Fright\". In the 1940 film \"Forty Thousand Horsemen\", the three leads, played by Grant Taylor, Chips Rafferty, and Pat Twohill, are introduced to us playing two-up in a market place.\n\nThe film \"Wake in Fright\" contains scenes where the main protagonist, a schoolteacher named John Grant, staying in a semi fictional mining town based on Broken Hill for one night, initially makes significant winnings in a game of two-up, before subsequently losing everything again.\n\nThe book \"Come in Spinner\" takes its name from the call. There is also a sequence in the film \"The Shiralee\" starring Bryan Brown which makes reference to the game.\n\nDuring the broadcast recording of the 'Tin Symphony' segment of the opening ceremony of the 2000 Olympic Games there are two scenes of settlers playing two-up outside a tin home.\n\nIn 2009, the television program \"\" shows men taking part in games of two-up. In one instance the police enter the establishment in which this is taking place and the contestants run and hide the equipment being used and money being gambled.\n\nIn 2014, the television program \"Peaky Blinders\" depicts a game of two-up, with a car and a horse used for betting.\n\nOn 20 February 2015, a game of two-up featured in \"The Doctor Blake Mysteries\", series 3, episode 2, titled \"My Brother's Keeper\".\n\n\n"}

He is currently ranked number 11 in Major League Eating’s list of competitive eaters.\n\nSalem is the Tour de Donut and the Donut Derby champion. He is also the former National Sweet Corn Eating champion and world record-holder (47 ears of corn in 12 minutes), and has competed in the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest five times.\n\nSalem frequently appears in the media to discuss his competitions and activities in outlets such as Runner's World magazine, Bicycling magazine, Triathlete magazine, Men's Health magazine, Men's Fitness magazine, ESPN, Muscle & Fitness, Women's Health, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, MSNBC, ABC.\n\nSalem was born in Houston, Texas. He is of Egyptian, Turkish and Armenian ancestry. He attended Clear Lake High School in Houston, Texas, and went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts in Economics at the University of Texas at Austin, as well as an MBA at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey.\n\nSalem’s first Major League Eating win was at the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest Qualifier in Concord, North Carolina in 2012. His first Major League Eating title came in September 2013, when he ate 31.75 cannoli at Little Italy’s Feast of San Gennaro Cannoli Eating Championship. Salem’s first Tour de Donut championship was the Tour de Donut Ohio in 2014.\n\nSalem has competed in several Tour de Donut road races across America. Each city’s annual bicycle race has cyclists race for 30 miles to earn the lowest times by eating donuts at two pit stops along the track. For each donut consumed, riders’ times are reduced by five minutes. Rather than award the first cyclist to cross the finish line, the champion with the lowest \"donut-adjusted time\" is named the winner of the race. Salem eats 12 donuts at a time during the races.\n\nCities and years competed:\n\nSalem competed in Pennsylvania’s Donut Derby bicycle race in 2015, 2016 and 2017, achieving his best \"donut style\" bicycle race by eating 61 donuts over 36 miles for a donut-adjusted time of -31 minutes.\n\nSalem’s entry into the competitive eating scene started as something of a joke. \"I was watching the Nathan’s contest in 2008, and I thought, ‘Wow, all I have to do is eat a bunch of hot dogs and I can be on ESPN?’\" he told Mental Floss. He trains by eating a 4 to 6 pounds salad everyday for lunch followed by a gallon of water. He credits enlisting the help of a hypnotherapist as a key turning point in his success as a competitive eater.\n\nSalem ran and completed his first marathon in the 2010 New York City Marathon. By June 2017, he had completed 20.\n\nHe competed in his first New York City Triathlon in 2012, having only learned to swim that same year. He then competed in his first Ironman in 2013, and would complete four total by 2015.\n\nSalem owns 3 bicycles, and is known to use a Quintana Roo PR6 Ultegra Di2 with Reynolds Strike wheels for triathlons.\n\nHe has stated his intent to run one marathon each month in 2017, and is currently training for the 2018 Race Across the West and the 2019 Race Across America ultra-endurance bicycle races, which are 900 and 3,000 miles, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalem resides in New York City with his wife, whom he also runs marathons with, and their two cats.\n\nHe currently serves as Director, Group Marketing at Hearst for \"Esquire,\" \"Popular Mechanics, Car and Driver, and Road &Track\".\n\nSalem’s hobbies include growing and eating his own supply of organic fruits, vegetables, microgreens, and sprouts in his NYC home.\n\nList of competitive eaters\n"}
