The strike involved theatres in the cities of Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim. The strike started on 21 May 1941, as a response to the revocation of working permits for six actors, after they had refused to perform in the Nazified radio. It lasted for five weeks.\n\nIn Norway there was a state monopoly on radio, which was broadcast by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK). When Norway was invaded by Germany on 9 April 1940, the Nazis seized control of NRK. A Norwegian Theatre Directorate was established, subordinate to the Ministry of Culture and Enlightenment.\n\nDuring the early period of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, cultural conflicts did not surface. But eventually, about the turn of the year 1940/1941, actors started to express unwillingness to participate in German festivities, and to perform on radio. The resistance movement also issued a parole against radio performance broadcasts. On 14 January 1941 Minister Lunde issued a bull of excommunication, which said that any actor who declined to perform publicly, either on theatre, in radio or at festivities organized by the authorities, should not be allowed to work as an actor in Norway. This prompted theatre directors to gather in Oslo, and contact was established between the directors and the Norwegian Actors' Equity Association (NSF). There was a general agreement that Lunde's document violated basic civil rights, and that such violations were unacceptable. On 23 January board members of NSF were summoned to Reichskommissar Terboven's office, where they were told that German authorities supported the Ministry, and that violations would be met by the strongest measures. To be held responsible were both the actor herself/himself, the theatre director, the union representative, and the entire board of the NSF. Schwenzen, acting chairman of NSF, published the directives on bulletin boards at the various theatres. A strike parole, formulated by Gerda Ring and August Lange, was secretly distributed among actors, signed and hidden. The parole text said that if an artist should lose their work for non-artistical reasons, the undersigned were willing to take the consequence and go on strike. Subsequent negotiations between theatre workers and authorities eventually resulted in a document that was mutually accepted. In particular the document emphasized that actors could freely dispose of their spare time.\n\nIn early May 1941, seven actors eventually received a letter from the Ministry, in which they were ordered to play for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation when requested. The seven selected actors were Aase Bye, Elisabeth Gording, Lillemor von Hanno, Georg Løkkeberg, Gerda Ring, Lasse Segelcke and Tore Segelcke. Aase Bye was playing in Stockholm at the time and could not respond to the letter. The other six declared that they would continue their work at the theatre, but claimed their right to freely dispose of their spare time. On 21 May, the six actors were called to meet at the police headquarters Victoria Terrasse for interrogation, and all six were revoked of their working permits as actors. On the same evening the theatre strike was effective on all stages in Oslo. From the next day, also the theatres in Bergen and Trondheim joined the strike. This was the first time during the occupation that a complete occupational group went on strike. The conflict quickly escalated, as the Nazi authorities did not accept such behavior. On 22 May the theatre directors were summoned to the Gestapo and instructed to order the actors to resume performing. The instructions were accompanied with threats of strongest reprisals. On a meeting between directors and actors in Oslo on 23 May, the German threats were communicated to the actors. The meeting decided to keep on striking, with 110 against 18 votes. On 24 May the Germans presented a new ultimatum, they also arrested union representatives at the theatres in Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim, and the next day also central members of the Norwegian Actors' Equity Association. At a meeting between all theatre directors and chairmen on 26 May, a letter of protest was signed and sent to Reichskommissar Terboven. The letter referred to Article 43 of the \"Laws and Customs of War on Land\" from the Hague Convention of 1907, which states that the occupant of a country shall respect the laws in force in the country. This letter was never answered. The strike continued. In June the Germans declared that the strike was regarded as a revolt against the Wehrmacht and der Führer. The strike was mentioned in Swiss newspapers, and Germans announced that this now had turned into a high political affair. Negotiations continued until 20 June, when the actors agreed it was time to end the strike. During the negotiations various threats had been mentioned, including death penalties. The strike had lasted five weeks.\n\nAfter the conflict the Ministry of Culture decided to take full control of the theatres. The board members of Nationaltheatret were replaced, and Harald Grieg, Francis Bull and Johannes Sejersted Bødtker were arrested and incarcerated at the Grini concentration camp for years. After the nazification of the theatres, a general boycott from the public became effective. Some actors continued to play during the war years, while others fled from the country after a while. Trøndelag Teater in Trondheim did try to carry on, with both subliminal and open satire against the Nazi authorities. Its director Henry Gleditsch was warned several times that there might be an imminent crackdown on his theatre, and advised to flee to the neutral country Sweden. Gleditsch did not do so. In October 1942, the authorities declared martial law in Trondheim following the Majavatn affair. The opportunity was seized to apprehend Gleditsch, and he was promptly executed. Trøndelag Teater was subsequently nazified and, similar to other such theatres, boycotted.\n"}
{"id": "511640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=511640", "title": "5.1 surround sound", "text": "5.1 surround sound\n\n5.1 surround sound (\"five-point one\") is the common name for six channel surround sound audio systems. 5.1 is the most commonly used layout in home cinema. It uses five full bandwidth channels and one low-frequency effects channel (the \"point one\"). Dolby Digital, Dolby Pro Logic II, DTS, SDDS, and THX are all common 5.1 systems. 5.1 is also the standard surround sound audio component of digital broadcast and music.\n\nAll 5.1 systems use the same speaker channels and configuration, having a front left and right, a center channel, two surround channels and the low-frequency effects channel designed for a subwoofer.\n\nA prototype for five-channel surround sound, then dubbed \"quintaphonic sound\", was used in the 1975 film \"Tommy\".\n\n5.1 dates back to 1976 when Dolby Labs modified the track usage of the six analogue magnetic soundtracks on Todd-AO 70 mm film prints. The Dolby application of optical matrix encoding in 1976 (released on the film, \"Logan's Run\") did not use split surrounds, and thus was not 5.1. Dolby's first use of split surrounds was with 70mm film, which received wide release in 1979 with \"Apocalypse Now\". Instead of the five screen channels and one surround channel of the Todd-AO format, Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track provided three screen channels, two high-passed surround channels and a low-frequency surround channel monophonically blended with the two surround channels.\n\nWhen digital sound was applied to 35 mm release prints, starting with \"Batman Returns\" in 1992, the 5.1 layout was adopted. The ability to provide 5.1 sound had been one of the key reasons for using 70 mm for prestige screenings. The provision of 5.1 digital sound on 35 mm significantly reduced the use of the very expensive 70 mm format. Digital sound and the 5.1 format were introduced in 1990, by KODAK and Optical Radiation Corporation, with releases of \"Days of Thunder\" and \"The Doors\" using the CDS (Cinema Digital Sound) format.\n\n5.1 digital surround, in the forms of Dolby Digital AC3 and DTS, started appearing on several mid 90s Laserdisc releases, with among the earliest being \"Clear and Present Danger\" and \"Jurassic Park\" (the latter having both AC3 and DTS versions). Many DVD releases have Dolby Digital tracks up to 5.1 channels, due to the implementation of Dolby Digital in the development of the DVD format. In addition, some DVDs have DTS tracks with most being 5.1 channel mixes (a few releases, however, have 6.1 “matrixed” tracks). Blu-ray and digital cinema both have eight-channel capability which can be used to provide either 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound. 7.1 is an extension of 5.1 that uses four surround zones: two at the sides and two at the back.\n\nA system of digital 5.1 surround sound has also been used in 1987 at the Parisian cabaret the Moulin Rouge, created by French engineer Dominique Bertrand. To achieve such a system in 1985 a dedicated mixing console had to be designed in cooperation with Solid State Logic, based on their 5000 series, and dedicated speakers in cooperation with APG. The console included ABCDEF channels. Respectively: A left, B right, C centre, D left rear, E right rear, F bass. The same engineer had already developed a similar 3.1 system in 1973, for use at the official International Summit of Francophone States in Dakar.\n\nThe order of channels in a 5.1 file is different across file formats. The order in WAV files is (not complete) Front Left, Front Right, Center, Low-frequency effects, Surround Left, Surround Right.\n\nRegarding music, the main goal of 5.1 surround sound is a proper localization and equability of all acoustic sources for a centered positioned audience. Therefore, ideally five matched speakers should be used.\n\nFor play-back of 5.1 music recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) have been released and propose the following configuration (ITU-R BS 775):\n\n"}

{"id": "28485759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28485759", "title": "Balloon fetish", "text": "Balloon fetish\n\nA balloon fetish is a sexual fetish that involves balloons. A balloon fetishist is also referred to as a \"looner\". Some balloon fetishists \"revel in the popping of balloons and [others] may become anxious and tearful at the very thought of popping balloons\". Others enjoy blowing up balloons or sitting and lying on them.\n\nLike many paraphilias, the origins of a balloon fetish are complex and vary between individuals, but may be explained as a form of sexual imprinting. Many \"looners\" attribute their fetish to early sexual or pre-sexual experiences with balloons, often involving their being burst by members of the desirable sex. These experiences frequently accompany or instigate a phobia of balloons in the individual, most often associated with the sudden loud noise when they burst, a form of phonophobia.\n\nDepending on the extent to which this phobia persists through and after puberty, balloon fetishists may regard balloons bursting as either essential to the sexual experience (and frequently refer to themselves as poppers), or to be avoided at all costs (as non-poppers). Even those who are not phobic of the act of a balloon popping may prefer not to pop due to an anthropomorphized emotional attachment to the balloon, which is perfectly normal to non-poppers. One hallmark of the distinction between poppers and non-poppers may be in seeing balloons' bursting either as a metaphor for orgasm, or as a metaphor for death.\n\nThat popping balloons is central to several popular party games suggests that enjoyment of the act, the challenge, and the anticipation of popping is not confined to fetishists. However, for fetishists the adrenaline rush associated with the \"danger\" that a balloon will pop produces a sexual response. This helps to explain why even non-poppers who have an intense phobia of balloons popping in non-sexual contexts may be aroused by the possibility within safe sexual contexts. It may even suggest that balloon fetish, for poppers and non-poppers alike, is part of the BDSM spectrum of fetishes in which a controlled amount of danger is used to elicit a pleasurable fight-or-flight response in participants.\n\nA true fetish is characterized in the DSM-IV by its social and occupational impedance. However, it is currently in the DSM-V (see Paraphilic Disorders) to where a fetish is no longer considered as a disorder (except for fetishistic disorder where if the fetish interferes with the person's life). Yet, fetishism is classified as code F65.0 in the ICD-10. Aside from these hazards, balloon fetishism carries with it the hazards of bursting balloons in close proximity to one's body. Eye and ear protection is recommended for such exposure to avoid eye damage or hearing loss. These hazards may be heightened since balloon fetishists often employ larger-than-average balloons and high-energy forms of popping them, such as overinflation.\n\nIn addition, those who sit, stomp, or lie on large balloons may be vulnerable to fall injuries when the balloons burst. Additional injuries may occur due to friction and static electricity during prolonged interactions with balloons. Choking is a potential risk for those \"looners\" for whom the fetish includes kissing or mouthing the balloon. Although largely hypothetical, a \"looner\" engaged in an orgy with multiple helium-filled balloons may sustain impact injuries such as pelvic fractures, falling from heights at the moment of climax.\n\nA different form of this fetish is the \"Bubblegum Balloon Fetish\" or \"Bubblegum Looning\", where, instead of latex balloons, Bubblegum is used to produce small to big balloons (depending on the size of the gum). In this case, the \"popper\" or \"non-popper\" difference is absent since balloons can be produced over and over (differently from latex ones, that, once burst, have to be discarded).\nBubblegum looners tend to like watching people produce balloons with bubblegum or producing balloons themselves.\n\nAs with balloon looning, Bubblegum Looning can be used in sexual activities to enhance sexual performances. In this case, bubblegum balloons may also be blown against some partner's body parts to enhance sexual excitement or as a form of game play.\n\nA number of looners also enjoy other variations, such as rubber glove balloons (mainly latex and nitrile medical gloves), condoms, beach balls, the Wubble Bubble Ball, inflatable PVC plastic toys (mainly blow up sharks, whales, and hammers), and inflating bin liners or garbage bags. The latter is often combined with a crush fetish where the looner is aroused the sight of glossy, polyethylene garbage sacks being compressed by the hydraulic compactor of a garbage truck or other similar apparatus to the point where they burst or explode - in its most extreme form this may even be combined with a form of vorarephilia, where the looner desires to be crushed and consumed by the machine itself along with the sacks.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7775853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7775853", "title": "Big Bumpin'", "text": "Big Bumpin'\n\nBig Bumpin' is an advergaming title from Burger King for the Xbox and Xbox 360 video game consoles. published by King Games and developed by Blitz Games. On November 19, 2006, Burger King started selling it with any value meal. It is one of three titles released by Burger King.\n\n\"Big Bumpin\"' is based on bumper cars, featuring characters familiar to Burger King, like the Subservient Chicken, Brooke Burke, and the Burger King himself. Obstacles in the arenas (\"theme parks\") include pits and saws. Players can gain power-ups which allow them to deal specific damages. The arenas include the Ice Box, Broiler, King's Court, The Deep, and Monsoon of Doom. The game supports up to four players, as well as up to eight using Xbox Live.\n\nPocketBike Racer, Sneak King, and Big Bumpin' were all created in just seven months and were considered to be of such high quality that they were pulled from Xbox Live Arcade to be sold as a 'box product' directly in Burger King stores (they are currently only available in America and Canada).\n\nThe origin of three Burger King-themed Xbox Games came about in Cannes when senior executives from Microsoft and Burger King met at the awards for the I Love Bees and Subservient Chicken advertising campaigns. Microsoft wanted the Xbox games to be fun for the players and that the environment would be a Burger King-themed context not be reduced to simply pushing its brand. In the fall of 2005, Blitz Games entered into talks with Burger King and the development team began work in February 2006. In an interview with Gamasutra, Philip Oliver stated that he was talking with Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade portfolio manager, Ross Erickson and had an interest in developing Xbox Live games, but lacked funding as an independent developer. During Oliver and Erickson's talks, Erickson agree to notify Oliver of any leads on advertisers looking for product placement in video games. A week or two after that, Oliver received a call from Erickson about Burger King's interest in creating three games. Gamasutra's interviewer, Brandon Sheffield, noted the odd choice of an American company using a British developer, but Oliver explained that Burger King was familiar with their first Xbox release \"Fuzion Frenzy\".\n\nThe development began as Xbox Live games, but Burger King wanted the games to also be playable on the Xbox, but the console platform was not able to access Xbox Live Arcade. Burger King decided that having them as boxed games which would require the customer to come into the store to obtain the game. When advised of the difficulty in the production, Burger King explained that it would be able to get approval from Microsoft and that both the Xbox and Xbox360 versions of the game should be available on the same disc.\n\nBlitz Games assigned two project managers for the games, Chris Swan and John Jarvis, who held daily conference calls with Burger King and Microsoft's Xbox division throughout the project. Blitz Games worked on increasing communication between the companies by showing the development process for a previous game, from \"first the black and white sketches, then the color concepts, environment blockouts, texturing and lighting, and finally the results on screen.\" By laying out a previous workflow process, Blitz Games helped to bridged the advertising presentation gap Burger King's marketers; a failure of which could have \"crippled the project.\" Burger King and Blitz Games held daily conference calls to review the designs and Burger King was most concerned with the positive portrayal of the characters.\n\nBlitz Games had staff of fifteen people working on the original Xbox360 games grew to nearly sixty persons after Burger King increased the contract and budget for the games. In total, 80 developers were involved in the project. The task of producing two different versions were made easier by Blitz Games' production toolchain that had built-in compatibility for Xbox and the developers able to adjust the game with appropriate hardware coding that had already been previously developed by the company. During the end of each month of the development, the builds of the games were provided to Microsoft as required of all developers. Both masters of the games are included on the discs, Oliver guesses that the Xbox and Xbox360 were able to launch the specific executable based on file name because each disc contains two separate masters and two separate sets of assets. Oliver judged that the Xbox 360's graphics were twice as good as the Xbox, but was far from utilizing the full performance of the Xbox360 hardware. Tasked with creating three games, Blitz Games managed to get an extra month to develop the game due to the challenges involved in the production and a second month after Microsoft agreed to \"fast track\" the games through the Quality Assurance process. Oliver summed it up by stating \"But we still had to effectively do three original games, two (Stock keeping units) of each, in seven months. Scary, but we did it! They're all mastered, they're all in production, and there’s going to be two million units of each disc.\"\n\n\"Big Bumpin\" was one of three promotional Burger King-themed releases for winter 2006, the other two games were \"Sneak King\" and \"Pocketbike Racer\". The Burger King-only marketing run was from November 19 through December 24, 2006. The games were available for $3.99 with any purchase of any Burger King value meal. Destructoid later noted that the cost of the games were later reduced to $0.99 in February 2007. In January 2007, the marketing firm Crispin Porter + Bogusky stated that more than 2.7 million games were sold in the promotion. It was reported that more than 3.2 million copies were sold, \"Big Bumpin\" sales by itself were not given, in \"Game Developer\"s April 2007 issue.\n\nBig Bumpin' was the most well received of the three games. It currently holds a 7/10 based on 14 reviews on GameSpot.\n\nThe immediate impact of the project on Blitz Games was the financial boost it provided, it allowed the company to improve its technology and it also partially funded Blitz Games' Blitz Arcade. Collectively, the games were enough to be ranked amongst the top 10 best selling games of 2006. Story wrote, \"Using Xbox data on game use, the Burger King game equates in time spent to more than 1.4 billion 30-second commercials[.]\" The success of the project, including \"Big Bumpin\" was noted as a key part of Burger King's 40% increase in sales during the quarter and it was affirmed by Russell Klein that Burger King attributed the majority of that success to the project.\n\n"}

{"id": "21481572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21481572", "title": "Chick flick", "text": "Chick flick\n\nChick flick is a slang term for the film genre dealing mainly with love and romance which is targeted to a female audience. It can be specifically defined as a genre in which a woman is the protagonist. Although many types of films may be directed toward the female gender, \"chick flick\" is typically used only in reference to films that contain emotion or themes that are relationship-based (although not necessarily romantic as films may focus on parent-child or friend relationships). Chick flicks often are released \"en masse\" around Valentine's Day. The equivalent for male audiences is the guy-cry film. Feminists such as Gloria Steinem have objected to terms such as \"chick flick\" and the related term \"chick lit\", and a film critic has called the term \"chick flick\" derogatory.\n\nGenerally, a chick flick is a film designed to have an innate appeal to women, typically young women. Defining a chick flick is, as \"The New York Times\" has stated, more of a parlor game than a science. These films are generally held in popular culture as having formulaic, paint-by-numbers plot lines and characters. This makes usage of the term \"problematic\" for implying \"frivolity, artlessness, and utter commercialism\", according to ReelzChannel. However, several chick flicks have received high critical acclaim for their stories and performances. For example, the 1983 film \"Terms of Endearment\" received Academy Awards for Best Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Actor in a Supporting Role. More recently, the film \"La La Land\" (called a chick flick in some circles), featuring both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, won Best Actress at the Academy Awards. Both of these actors were well known for their roles in chick flicks before jumping to the academy level.\n\nSome frequent elements of chick flicks include having a female protagonist, thematic use of the color pink (along with metaphorical allusions of the color), and romance and/or dating-based storylines. Longtime producer Jerry Bruckheimer has remarked about the plots, \"How do you cope with money and love?\"\n\nWomen are typically portrayed in chick flicks as sassy, noble victims, or klutzy twentysomethings. Romantic comedies are considered a subgenre of the chick flick. However, romantic comedies are typically respected more than chick flicks because they are designed to appeal to men and women.\n\nFemale MSN.com commentator Kim Morgan has written,\n\nThe term \"chick flick\" was not widely used until the 1980s and 1990s but is reported to have been coined by Brian Callaghan of Montreal, Canada in the mid-1970s while discussing movies with a friend in a schoolyard. It has its roots in the \"women's pictures\" of the early twentieth century, which portrays the woman as a victim and housewife, and later the \"film noir\" of the 1940s and early 1950s, which portrays the threat of sexualized women. In the 1950s, many women who were in the workforce during World War II faced the transition back into the home. Brandon French notes that the women's films of the 1950s \"shed light on a different cluster of issues and situations women faced in their transition from the forties to the sixties: romance, courtship, work, marriage, sex, motherhood, divorce, loneliness, adultery, alcoholism, widowhood, heroism, madness, and ambition.\"\n\nThe 1961 film \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", commonly known as one of the \"classic\" films from the golden age of cinema, is sometimes considered an early chick flick due to common elements such as dealing with loneliness, obsessive materialism, and happy endings. Author Molly Haskell has suggested that chick flicks are very different from the women's films of the 1940s and 1950s in that they now \"sing a different tune.\" She feels that they are \"more defiant and upbeat, post-modern and post-feminist.\"\n\nIn the U.S. in the 1980s, a succession of teenage drama pictures also labeled as chick flicks were released, many by director John Hughes. These often had a different and more realistic tone than previous chick flicks, with dramatic elements such as abortion and personal alienation being included.\n\nSeveral chick flicks have been patterned after the story of Cinderella and other fairy tales (e.g. \"A Cinderella Story\", \"Ever After\", and \"Pretty Woman\"), or even Shakespeare in the case of \"She's the Man\" and \"10 Things I Hate About You\". In addition, a large number are adapted from popular novels (e.g. \"The Princess Diaries\", \"The Devil Wears Prada\") and literary classics (e.g. \"Little Women\"). While most films that are considered chick flicks are lighthearted, some suspense films also fall under this category, such as \"What Lies Beneath\".\n\nAfter the blockbuster success of the 2008 drama/romance film \"Twilight\", Paul Dergarabedian of Media By Numbers remarked, \"[t]he word 'chick flick' is going to have to be replaced by big box-office girl-power flick\" and that \"[t]he box-office clout of the female audience is just astounding, and it's been an underserved audience for way too long\". He also said, \"they have no trouble finding money for the things they're passionate about.\" According to Fandango.com, more than 75% of \"Twilight\" opening-weekend audience was female.\n\nThe term “chick flick” has generated several negative responses from the modern feminist community. Most criticisms of the genre concentrate on the negative consequences that arise from gendering certain interests, in this case film. Author of \"The Chick Flick Paradox: Derogatory? Feminist? or Both?\", Natalia Thompson, states that chick flicks are “an attempt to lump together an entire gender’s interests into one genre.” While the tailoring of interests may seem helpful and natural, many critics argue that unnecessary gendering can have negative consequences on many different social groups. In fact, there is evidence from Russian social scientist Natal'ia Rimashevskaia that gender stereotypes further perpetuated by the media can lead to discrimination against women and limit their “human and intellectual potential.” More criticisms of the term arise from actual content of the films in the chick flick genre and how the content affects society's perception of women. Some say that chick flicks are micro-aggressions. Micro-aggressions are actions or exchanges that degrade a person based on his or her membership in a \"race, gender, age, and ability.\"\n\nDespite the genre's obvious success, some film critics take issue with the content most chick flicks have in common. Although the subcategories represent different plot lines, all five have several characteristics in common. Many chick flicks can have an \"ironic, self-deprecating tone\", claims film theorist Hilary Radner. This tone is one of the defining characteristics of the genre, and many feel that it lacks substance compared to other genres. Radner also goes on to say the genre is \"incredibly heteronormative and white-washed.\" These common characteristics of the genre can lead to criticism from minority groups and social justice activists. More issues with the genre emerge from the opinion that chick flicks play to every woman's \"patriarchal unconscious.\"\n\nIn her article \"Structural Integrity, Historical Reversion, and the Post-9/11 Chick Flick\", Diane Negra focuses on several romantic comedies, deemed to be chick flicks, set in New York City after the attacks on September 11th, 2001. She claims that the films \"centralize female subjectivity but more compellingly undertake political work to stabilize national identity post-9/11.\" The political and social upheaval following the attacks led to a need for films that show the importance of protecting gender and family norms, or \"ideological boundaries,\" as opposed to the emphasis on \"survivalism\" and \"homeland security,\" used to protect national boundaries, seen in the action films at the time. Juxtaposed with the \"politically innocent\" genre of the pre-9/11 period, the films are rife with political undertones that are meant \"to stabilize national identity post-9/11.\" \n\nWhile the plot of a chick flick is typically expected to be centered around a romantic conquest, Alison Winch (\"We Can Have It All\") writes about films she calls \"girlfriend flicks.\" These movies emphasize the relationships between friends instead of focusing on a love connection, and examples include \"Bride Wars\" and \"Baby Mama\".\n\nAccording to Winch, \n\nWinch also states that girlfriend flicks are meant to criticize \"second wave feminism’s superficial understanding of female solidarity\" by showing \"conflict, pain, and betrayal acted out between women.\" By emphasizing the \"complexities of women's relationships,\" the girlfriend flick breaks the mold for the usual chick flick and allows the genre to gain a bit of depth.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7148", "title": "Collective noun", "text": "Collective noun\n\nIn linguistics, a collective noun refers to a collection of things taken as a whole. Most collective nouns in everyday speech are mundane and \"not\" specific to just one kind, such as the word \"group\", which is applied to \"people\" in the phrase \"a group of people\", but is also applied to \"dogs\" in the phrase \"a group of dogs\". Other collective nouns \"are specific\" to one kind, especially terms of venery, which identify specific groups of animals. For example, \"pride\" as a term of venery always refers to lions, never to dogs or cows. Similarly, a group of owls is called a \"parliament\".\n\nDifferent forms of English handle verb agreement with collective count nouns differently; in particular, users of British English generally accept that collective nouns take either singular or plural verb forms depending on context and the metonymic shift that it implies.\n\nMorphological derivation accounts for many collective words and various languages have common affixes for denoting collective nouns. Because derivation is a slower and less productive word formation process than the more overtly syntactical morphological methods, there are fewer collectives formed this way. As with all derived words, derivational collectives often differ semantically from the original words, acquiring new connotations and even new denotations.\n\nEarly Proto-Indo-European used the suffix *eh2 to form collective nouns. From there we have, for example, the Latin neuter plural ending -a. Late Proto-Indo-European used the ending *t. From there we have the English ending -th, as in \"youth\".\n\nThe English endings \"-age\" and \"-ade\" often signify a collective. Sometimes, the relationship is easily recognizable: \"baggage, drainage, blockade.\" Though the etymology is plain to see, the derived words take on a distinct meaning. This is a productive ending, as evidenced in the recent coin, \"signage\".\n\nGerman uses the prefix \"ge-\" to create collectives. The root word often undergoes umlaut and suffixation as well as receiving the \"ge-\" prefix. Nearly all nouns created in that way are of neuter gender:\nThere are also several endings that can be used to create collectives, such as \"welt\" and \"masse\".\n\nDutch has a similar pattern but sometimes uses the (unproductive) circumfix \":\n\nThe following Swedish example has different words in the collective form and in the individual form:\n\nEsperanto uses the collective suffix -\"ar\" to produce a large number of derived words:\n\nTwo good examples of collective nouns are \"team\" and \"government\", which are both words referring to groups of (usually) people. Both \"team\" and \"government\" are count nouns (consider: \"one team\", \"two teams\", \"most teams\"; \"one government\", \"two governments\", \"many governments\").\n\nConfusion often stems from the way that different forms of English handle agreement with collective nouns—specifically, whether or not to use the collective singular: the singular verb form with a collective noun. The plural verb forms are often used in British English with the singular forms of these count nouns (e.g., \"The team \"have\" finished the project.\"). Conversely, in the English language as a whole, singular verb forms can often be used with nouns ending in \"-s\" that were once considered plural (e.g., \"Physics \"is\" my favorite academic subject\"). This apparent \"number mismatch\" is a natural and logical feature of human language, and its mechanism is a subtle metonymic shift in the concepts underlying the words.\n\nIn British English, it is generally accepted that collective nouns can take either singular or plural verb forms depending on the context and the metonymic shift that it implies. For example, \"the team \"is\" in the dressing room\" (\"formal agreement\") refers to \"the team\" as an ensemble, while \"the team \"are\" fighting among themselves\" (\"notional agreement\") refers to \"the team\" as individuals. That is also the British English practice with names of countries and cities in sports contexts (e.g., \"Newcastle \"have\" won the competition.\").\n\nIn American English, collective nouns almost always take singular verb forms (formal agreement). In cases that a metonymic shift would be revealed nearby, the whole sentence should be recast to avoid the metonymy. (For example, \"The team are fighting among themselves\" may become \"the team \"members\" are fighting among themselves\" or simply \"The team is infighting.\") Collective proper nouns are usually taken as singular (\"Apple is expected to release a new phone this year\"), unless the plural is explicit in the proper noun itself, in which case it is taken as plural (\"The Green Bay Packers are scheduled to play the Minnesota Vikings this weekend\").\nMore explicit examples of collective proper nouns include \"General Motors is once again the world's largest producer of vehicles,\" and \"Texas Instruments is a large producer of electronics here,\" and \"British Airways is an airline company in Europe.\" Furthermore, \"American Telephone & Telegraph\" is a telecommunications company in North America.\" Such phrases might look plural, but they are not.\n\nA good example of such a metonymic shift in the singular-to-plural direction (which, generally, occurs only in British English) is the following sentence: \"The team have finished the project.\" In that sentence, the underlying thought is of the individual members of the team working together to finish the project. Their accomplishment is collective, and the emphasis is not on their individual identities, but they are still discrete individuals; the word choice \"team have\" manages to convey both their collective and discrete identities simultaneously. A good example of such a metonymic shift in the plural-to-singular direction is the following sentence: \"Mathematics is my favorite academic subject.\" The word \"mathematics\" may have originally been plural in concept, referring to mathematic endeavors, but metonymic shift (the shift in concept from \"the endeavors\" to \"the whole set of endeavors\") produced the usage of \"mathematics\" as a singular entity taking singular verb forms. (A true mass-noun sense of \"mathematics\" followed naturally.)\n\nNominally singular pronouns can be collective nouns taking plural verbs, according to the same rules that apply to other collective nouns. For example, it is correct usage in both British English and American English usage to say: \"None are so fallible as those who are sure they're right.\" In that case, the plural verb is used because the context for \"none\" suggests more than one thing or person.\n\nOther examples include:\n\nThis does not, however, affect the tense later in the sentence:\n\nExceptions to the rule include singular group names preceded by an article:\n\nThis exception does not apply to artists whose name is preceded by an article, but ends in a singular:\n\nAbbreviations provide other \"exceptions\" in American usage concerning plurals:\n\nWhen only the name is plural but not the object, place, or person:\n\nThe tradition of using \"terms of venery\" or \"nouns of assembly\", collective nouns that are specific to certain kinds of animals, stems from an English hunting tradition of the Late Middle Ages. The fashion of a consciously developed hunting language came to England from France. It was marked by an extensive proliferation of specialist vocabulary, applying different names to the same feature in different animals. The elements can be shown to have already been part of French and English hunting terminology by the beginning of the 14th century. In the course of the 14th century, it became a courtly fashion to extend the vocabulary, and by the 15th century, the tendency had reached exaggerated proportions.\n\n\"The Treatise\", written by Walter of Bibbesworth in the mid-1200s, is the earliest source for collective nouns of animals in any European vernacular (and also the earliest source for animal noises). The \"Venerie\" of Twiti (early 14th century) distinguished three types of droppings of animals, and three different terms for herds of animals. Gaston Phoebus (14th century) had five terms for droppings of animals, which were extended to seven in the \"Master of the Game\" (early 15th century). The focus on collective terms for groups of animals emerged in the later 15th century. Thus, a list of collective nouns in Egerton MS 1995, dated to c. 1452 under the heading of \"termis of venery &c.\"\"\", extends to 70 items, and the list in the \"Book of Saint Albans\" (1486) runs to 165 items, many of which, even though introduced by \"the compaynys of beestys and fowlys\", relate not to venery but to human groups and professions and are clearly humorous, such as \"a Doctryne of doctoris\", \"a Sentence of Juges\", \"a Fightyng of beggers\", \"an uncredibilite of Cocoldis\", \"a Melody of harpers\", \"a Gagle of women\", \"a Disworship of Scottis\", etc.\n\nThe \"Book of Saint Albans\" became very popular during the 16th century and was reprinted frequently. Gervase Markham edited and commented on the list in his \"The Gentleman's Academic\", in 1595. The book's popularity had the effect of perpetuating many of these terms as part of the Standard English lexicon even if they have long ceased to have any practical application.\n\nEven in their original context of medieval venery, the terms were of the nature of kennings, intended as a mark of erudition of the gentlemen able to use them correctly rather than for practical communication. The popularity of the terms in the modern period has resulted in the addition of numerous lighthearted, humorous or facetious collective nouns.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The members wore distinctive hosiery which gave them their name (calza means sock in Italian) and met to arrange entertainments such as feasts and games.\n\nThey were founded around the mid 15th century in Venice where they organised the \"spettacoli cittadin\" (spectacles of the citizens). At the annual Carnival of Venice, they arranged a series of performances for the Venetian nobility for which famous jesters of the time were hired. They also produced plays by famous playwrights such as Angelo Beolco and Pietro Aretino. They subsequently divided into separate companies. Some were named after virtues, such as the \"Floridi\", the \"Uniti\" or the \"Concordi\" while others were named after guilds such as the \"Ortolani\" (greengrocers) and the \"Zardinieri\" (gardeners). They distinguished themselves by the colour of their stockings and embroidery with the name or initials of the company.\n\nAmong the principal spectacles promoted by the companies were the \"momaria\" — masked processions held along the canals — boat races, mock naval battles and theatrical performances held on floating theatres. During the \"festa della Sensa\", which celebrated the marriage of the city to the sea, elaborate rituals were performed with foreign ambassadors and dignitaries in attendance. \nAccounts of the companies appear in the diaries of Marino Sanuto the Younger.\n"}
{"id": "43011121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43011121", "title": "Cuphead", "text": "Cuphead\n\nCuphead is a run and gun indie video game developed and published by StudioMDHR. First announced in 2014, the game was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One in September 2017. A port for macOS followed in October 2018. The game was inspired by the rubber hose style of animation used in cartoons of the 1930s, such as the work of studios Fleischer and Walt Disney Animation, seeking to emulate their subversive and surrealist qualities. \n\n\"Cuphead\" features one or two players taking control of animated characters Cuphead and his brother Mugman to fight through several levels that culminate in boss fights as to repay their debt to the devil. The game was praised for its art style and noted for its challenging difficulty; it was both a critical and commercial success, selling over three million copies by August 2018. The game won several awards and accolades for its art, animation, and music.\n\n\"Cuphead\" gameplay is based around continual boss fights, with interspersed run and gun levels. The game also includes role-playing elements, and a branching level sequence. Cuphead has infinite lives, maintaining all equipment between deaths. The player can purchase weapons and \"Charms\" (special abilities) from the shop using coins collected from the run-and-gun levels. Player characters feature a parry attack that can be used on certain objects marked in pink, to various effects; the most important of them being increasing a \"super meter\" that enables more powerful attacks.\n\nAfter completing a level, the player will be ranked with a grade based on their performance, through factors such as the time taken to defeat a boss, damage taken/avoided, and number of parried attacks. The levels are accessible through a top-down perspective overworld with its own secret areas. The game also has a two-player local cooperative mode that allows another player to play as Mugman.\n\nOn the fictional Inkwell Isles, Cuphead and his brother Mugman are two fun-loving kids who live under the watchful eye of Elder Kettle. Against the elder's warnings, the brothers enter the Devil's Casino and begin playing craps. When they go on a winning streak, the Devil himself offers to raise the stakes. If Cuphead and Mugman can win one more roll, they will receive all the money in the casino; if not, the Devil will take their souls. Cuphead loses by rolling snake eyes, and he and Mugman beg for mercy. The Devil makes a deal with them: collect the \"soul contracts\" that signify his ownership of the souls of his runaway debtors by midnight the next day, and he might let them keep theirs. They visit Elder Kettle, who gives them a potion that allows them to fire blasts from their fingers to aid in their quest, but also warns them the debtors may change themselves to different things in attempt to stop them.\n\nThe brothers travel around the Inkwell Isles, fighting the residents who have lost their souls to the Devil in order to obtain their contracts. On entering the second island, the Elder Kettle informs them about \"doing the right thing\" when they come up against the Devil again. Once they have the contracts, they return to the Devil's Casino, but its manager King Dice blocks their way. He has lost a bet with the Devil, presumably over whether Cuphead and Mugman would be able to complete their task, and forces them to fight his own henchmen before confronting them directly. After the brothers defeat King Dice, the Devil demands that they hand over the contracts in exchange for \"joining his team\". What happens next depends on the choice of the player. If the player decides to do so, the Devil turns Cuphead and Mugman into his demonic lackeys and the game ends. If the player declines, the Devil becomes furious at the brothers' refusal to honor their deal and fights them himself. Cuphead and Mugman triumph over him, burn the contracts, and race home. Learning that they no longer have anything to fear from the Devil, the former debtors honor the brothers for their heroic actions.\n\n\"Cuphead\" was the first game by StudioMDHR, a Canadian indie game development studio consisting of brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer. Additional animation work was contributed by Jake Clark, with programming lead by Eric Billingsley. Its development began in 2010 using the Unity game engine, and it was developed from the brother's homes in Oakville, Ontario and Regina, Saskatchewan, respectively. The game was inspired by cartoons produced by the Fleischer and Walt Disney animation studios, along with cartoonists Ub Iwerks, Grim Natwick, and Willard Bowsky. Chad Moldenhauer called Fleischer Studios \"the magnetic north of his art style\", who particularly sought to mimic their \"subversive and surrealist\" elements.\n\nThe Moldenhauers watched 1930s-era cartoons in their youth, which Chad Moldenhauer describes as happenstance, based on gifts and VHS compilations. Among other siblings in their Regina, Saskatchewan childhood home, the two shared aesthetic taste and interest in gameplay. They attempted a game in the style of \"Cuphead\" in 2000, but lacked the tools to continue. The brothers decided to try again following the success of the indie game \"Super Meat Boy\", which released in 2010. The character that became Cuphead descended from a 1936 Japanese propaganda animated film where a man with a teacup for a head morphs into a tank. The Moldenhauers emulated the animation because they found it strange, and \"right away it stuck\". Before settling on him as the main character, the brothers had created around 150 different character designs, including a kappa in a tophat and characters with a plate or fork for a head.\n\nThe animation techniques behind \"Cuphead\" are similar to that of the 1930s cartoons. Chad Moldenhauer, who had previously worked in graphic design, would hand-draw the animations and paint the backgrounds using watercolors, colorizing them in Photoshop. The gameplay runs at a framerate of 60, while the animation runs at 24, which is a film standard. Chad Moldenhauer also saw his process with its human imperfections as a reaction to the perfectionism of pixel art. Jared Moldenhauer worked on other aspects of the game, though they would discuss gameplay design together. Their studio hired a Romanian developer, a Brooklyn animator, and an Ontario jazz musician for the project. They sought to keep the recording processes of the time period as if the team were developing in that era.\n\nThe Moldenhauers described \"Cuphead\" as having a difficult, \"retro game\" core for its emphasis on gameplay over plot. \"Kill Screen\" described the developers as \"obsessed\" with run and gun fundamentals of \"animations and exploits and hitboxes\". Over the development process, they have made multiple revisions to many gameplay elements, including how gameplay actions feel at the edges of platforms and how long players are disabled after receiving damage. They planned multiple difficulty levels, and chose to abandon a typical damsel in distress plot for one where Cuphead perpetually creates trouble for himself. The developers planned to surpass the Guinness World Record for number of boss battles in a run and gun game by having over 30 to the record's 25. The game's implementation and visual design, combined with the limited number of people available to work on the game, proved to be StudioMDHR's biggest challenge, so the Moldenhauers had to go the extra mile to bring the game to life, even remortgaging their house in order to finance the project.\n\nThough the game was shown during the Xbox press event of Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 to audience approval, \"Cuphead\" was not available to play and was estimated to be 40 percent complete. \"Cuphead\" was expected to be extended via expansion packs with 10 to 15 bosses each, similar to how \"Sonic & Knuckles\" added atop the \"Sonic\" series formula. \"Cuphead\" was released on September 29, 2017 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One, with potential later releases for macOS and Linux. \"Cuphead\" is an Xbox console exclusive, and supports Xbox Play Anywhere. King Features Syndicate has the licensing rights to \"Cuphead\" merchandise and assorted paraphernalia. Downloadable content for the game, titled \"The Delicious Last Course\" and featuring a new playable character, levels, and bosses, was revealed at E3 2018 for release in 2019. A port of \"Cuphead\" for macOS was released on October 19, 2018, and advertised with an animated short titled \"Crisp Apples\".\n\nBen Kuchera of \"Polygon\" wrote that \"Cuphead\" was one of the five most interesting reveals at Microsoft's E3 2014 press conference, even though he knew little about the game apart from its aesthetic. He said it \"stood out immediately\" and that everyone in the website's press room viscerally reacted to the trailer. \"Cuphead\" won the \"IGN\" Best Xbox One game at E3 award in 2015, and also won the award for \"Best Indie Game\" at the Gamescom 2015 Awards. It was also nominated as \"Best Independent Game\" at the E3 2016 Game Critics Awards.\n\n\"Cuphead\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game has also been noted for its difficulty by several media outlets. Destructoid's Brett Makedonski welcomed the high difficulty, which he noted as \"tough but fair\". Based on \"exhaustive\" pattern recognition, he said it ultimately relied on muscle memory, rather than reaction. He thought structuring the game around boss battles was well executed, and that each boss encounter held \"different and special and memorable\" traits. Praising the 1930s aesthetics as cohesive, Makedonski found the jazz-based soundtrack to be \"similarly fabulous\". Despite dying 188 times in his playthrough, Ray Carsillo at EGMNow felt no frustration from the difficulty, but rather motivation to \"dig my heels in deeper\". Carsillo lauded the \"gorgeous\" hand-drawn visuals, asserting that the only thing surpassing the artwork was the gameplay, which he said went \"beyond pattern recognition\". Peter Brown of \"GameSpot\" opined that combatting enemies provided a considerably rewarding experience. He described the cartoon aesthetic as charming, adding that it infused \"color and expression\" to the game. Further, he saw \"Cuphead\" as a \"true recreation\" of hand-drawn cel animation. Brown also relished how quick loading times proved beneficial to trial and error tactics.\n\nLucas Sullivan at GamesRadar+ wrote that \"Cuphead\" \"stands tall among the best 2D shooters of all time\", and agreed the gameplay challenges demanded patient pattern recognition to be accomplished, from which he said players would be rewarded \"tenfold\". Sullivan called the animation adorable, noting the wealth of detail present in the watercolor backdrops, and said it worked well with the gameplay. Like Carsillo, Sullivan claimed never to be frustrated with the difficulty. Giant Bomb's Ben Pack remarked that playing the game yielded one of his most enjoyable experiences with video games, citing the combination of \"brutal\" platforming and an \"exceptionally well realized\" art style. Writing for IGN, Joe Skrebels declared every scene a \"masterwork\" and commended the sound work, calling it an \"ideal match\" to the aesthetics. Platforming battles were seen as the most imaginative part of the game, and having no health bars for enemies its \"smartest\" and \"most devilish\" addition. Like Brown and Sullivan, Skrebels found the battles to be rewarding as well as \"one of \"Cuphead\" greatest strengths\". Chris Schilling of \"PC Gamer\" expressed approval of the controls, saying that their \"reliable jump and dash\" led to more \"nimble and responsive\" handling. Disagreeing with Makedonski, Schilling explained that certain random elements meant \"you can't simply learn patterns by rote and rely entirely on muscle memory\". Chris Plante at \"Polygon\" commented that, at its best, the game serves to educate the player in strategy through trial and error. He enjoyed the parrying system more so than the various attacks, as it proved to be a \"crucial\" and \"relatively forgiving\" mechanic. Colm Ahern of VideoGamer.com wrote in his verdict, \"\"Cuphead\" will best most games in how it looks and sounds, and defeating that boss that you once deemed unbeatable is glorious\".\n\nConversely, Makedonski said the \"eight-direction firing radius\" was his least favorite system in the game, calling it \"clunky and awkward\". Even though Brown saw \"the fear of the unexpected\" as part of what made \"Cuphead\" thrilling, he disparaged the game's failure to identify progress and capability. Skrebels thought that the \"run 'n' gun, left-to-right platforming\" lacked inventiveness, while also subjecting the \"parry system\" and control scheme to criticism. Plante complained that the final bosses made \"Cuphead\" greatest features less effective, and mentioned that the difficulty \"eventually goes too far\". Ahern agreed with Plante in his reproval of the final bosses, also saying that the challenge was \"a step too far\".\n\n\"Unwinnable\" writer Yussef Cole wrote an essay titled \"Cuphead and the Racist Spectre of Fleischer Animation\", in which he thought that by using the rubber hose animation style, Studio MDHR also brought up the \"bigotry and prejudice\" which had a strong influence on early animation, thinking that Studio MDHR ignored the context and history of the aesthetic it \"so faithfully\" replicated. Cole identifies that much of the imagery that Studio MDHR took from the Fleischer style effectively carried the racial stereotypes of the 1930s Harlem and minstrel shows that the animation style was built on. Chad and Jared Moldenhauer had stated prior to release that they wanted to make an animation style that harkened back to 1930s cartoons without getting ties to racism or minstrel shows in them. Maja Moldenhauer further stated that all they wanted from the Fleischers was the animation style and visuals, and that anything else happening \"in that era we're not versed in it\". In response to Cole's essay, Brandon Orselli of \"Niche Gamer\" defended the game as a tribute to that art style, writing that it was not meant to deliver narratives, or \"go anywhere beyond where it needs to go in terms of its basic and child-like storytelling\".The creator of episodic horror survival game \"Bendy and the Ink Machine\", which also uses rubber hose animation, has discussed wanting to make a cross over with \"Cuphead\".\n\nIn the two first weeks of release, \"Cuphead\" sold over one million copies worldwide, which had risen to three million by August 2018.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" placed \"Cuphead\" fifth on the list of its \"Best Games of 2017\", while GamesRadar ranked it ninth on their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017\", and \"Polygon\" ranked it 14th on their list of the \"50 best games of 2017\". In \"Game Informer\" Reader's Choice Best of 2017 Awards, the game won the \"Best Microsoft Game\" and \"Best Co-op Multiplayer\" categories, while it came in third place for \"Best Action Game\". The website also gave it the awards for \"Best Microsoft Exclusive\" in their \"Best of 2017 Awards\", and for \"Best Bosses\" in their 2017 Action Game of the Year Awards. EGMNow ranked the game at #2 on their list of the 25 best games of 2017, while Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw of \"Zero Punctuation\" ranked it third on his list of the Best Games of 2017. \"The Verge\" named it one of their 15 best video games of 2017.\n\n\"Cuphead\" was nominated for \"Breakout Game of the Year\" in \"PC Gamer\" 2017 Game of the Year Awards, and won the award for \"Best Xbox One Game\" in \"Destructoid\" Game of the Year Awards 2017. It also won the award for \"Best Xbox One Game\" and \"Best Art Direction\" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards, whereas its other nominations were for \"Game of the Year\", \"Best PC Game\", \"Best Platformer\", \"Best Original Music\", and \"Best Multiplayer\". The game also won the award for \"Best Looking Game\" and \"Best Style\", in addition to being runner-up for \"Best Shopkeeper\" for the character Porkrind, \"Best Music\", \"Best Debut\", and \"Game of the Year\" at Giant Bomb's Game of the Year 2017 Awards.\n"}

It presents his conspiracy theory that U.S. President Barack Obama's biological father was Frank Marshall Davis, an American poet and labor activist in Chicago and Hawaii, rather than the Kenyan Barack Obama Sr. The film claims that Davis (who had been a closet member of the Communist Party USA) influenced the young Obama's ideology, a claim disputed by Obama biographer David Remnick. The title is derived from Obama's memoir about his early life, \"Dreams from My Father\" (1995). Reviews of the film were generally negative, noting that Gilbert had not proved any of his allegations, and the film was described as a \"pseudo-documentary\" and in \"bad taste\".\n\nThe film alleges that Frank Marshall Davis, an African-American journalist, poet and labor activist, met Obama's mother Ann Dunham through her father Stanley Dunham. Filmmaker Gilbert claims that the senior Dunham was not a furniture salesman, but rather a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent tasked with monitoring communists in Hawaii. His claim is unsupported. In his memoir, Obama had noted that his grandfather Stanley Dunham and Davis were friends in Hawaii, and both had grown up in Kansas.\n\nFilmmaker Gilbert said the film was the result of two years of research. He claims he found nude and fetish photos of Obama's late mother Ann Dunham, which he says were taken in late 1960 by Davis in Davis' Hawaii home. Gilbert compared these to Dunham's high school pictures and says he found the similarity to be \"obvious\". \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said, \"He did not use an expert, however, to support his finding.\"\n\nGilbert says that more than one million copies of his film were mailed to voters in Iowa, Ohio, Nevada, New Hampshire and Colorado prior to the 2012 United States presidential election. He refused to disclose who funded the film's wide mailings. \"The Daily Beast\" reported that there was no way to verify the numbers claimed by Gilbert.\n\nCritical reaction to the film was largely negative. David Maraniss, author of \",\" described the film as \"preposterous,\" saying that it is \"depressing to have so much fictional, unreported, conspiratorial, unhistorical stuff floating around.\" Among anti-Obama productions, Maraniss said \"This DVD is the worst of the bunch.\"\n\n\"The Daily Beast\" commentator Michelle Goldberg wrote, \"It's tempting to ignore \"Dreams from My Real Father\" because it's so preposterous ... What matters here is not that a lone crank made a vulgar conspiracy video, one that outdoes even birther propaganda in its lunacy and bad taste. It’s that the video is finding an audience on the right.\" Steve Murphy, a Democratic consultant, said, \"It's about the lowest thing you can do to accuse, with no evidence, the opposition candidate's mother of being a porn star ... There are two motives behind this — racism and money. It's a cynical attempt to make some coin and exploit the views of the fringes of mainstream views.\"\n\n\"Slate\" said that the film \"peddles a conspiracy theory so convoluted that more traditional birthers must be envious of its creativity\".\n\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\" stated that the film makes unsubstantiated allegations that President Barack Obama lied about being the son of Barack Obama Sr.. Its reviewer also wrote, \"It's about the lowest thing you can do to accuse, with no evidence, the opposition candidate's mother of being a porn star\".\n\nOrly Taitz, who has said she believes that Obama was not born in the United States (the birther theory), disliked the film, as it claims Obama's father was an American, albeit a Communist. Neither allegation was supported.\n\nGilbert rejected this position: \"... 'birthers' are barking up the wrong tree. It's not a question of where Obama was born — but rather, one of paternity.\"\n\nBill Armistead, the chairman of the Alabama Republican Party, called the film's theory \"absolutely terrifying.\"\n\nBarack Obama’s estranged half-brother Malik Obama gave an interview to Gilbert and expressed interest in his theory.\n\nGilbert's claim that Obama's mother posted nude, allegedly by Davis, was proven false after blogger Loren Collins found that most of the photos Gilbert presented as evidence of his claim came from a magazine that ceased publication two years before Obama's mother arrived in Hawaii. Gilbert altered promotion of this claim on the website for his film in response to Collins' debunking, but he has never admitted his claim has been proven false or provided evidence to counter the debunking.\n\nIn 2014 activist Loren Collins filed a complaint against Gilbert with the Federal Election Commission, saying that the filmmaker was required to disclose his donors who financed the pre-election mailing of millions of unsolicited DVDs of the film to voters in several swing states. \"The Washington Post\" reported that in March 2016, the FEC, split evenly between Republican and Democratic members, ruled that Gilbert’s DVD mailing was considered “press”, and therefore not subject to donor disclosure as the mass-mailing could be argued to be a \"marketing effort\".\n\n"}

Within this enclosed area, customers can view movies from the privacy and comfort of their cars. Some drive-ins have small playgrounds for children and a few picnic tables or benches.\n\nThe screen can be as simple as a wall that is painted white, or it can be a steel truss structure with a complex finish. Originally, the movie's sound was provided by speakers on the screen and later by individual speakers hung from the window of each car, which were attached by wire. These systems were superseded by the more economical and easier to maintain method of broadcasting the soundtrack at a low output power on AM or FM radio to be picked up by a car radio. This also allows the soundtrack to be picked up in stereo by the audience on an in-car stereo system which is typically higher quality and fidelity than the simple speakers used in the old systems.\n\nA partial drive-in theater – Theatre de Guadalupe – was opened in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on April 23, 1915:\nSeven hundred people may be comfortably seated in the auditorium. Automobile entrances and places for 40 or more cars within the theater grounds and in-line position to see the pictures and witness all performances on the stage is a feature of the place that will please car owners.\n\nThe first movie shown by the Theatre de Guadalupe was \"Bags of Gold\", produced by Siegmund Lubin. Theatre de Guadalupe soon was renamed \"De Lux Theater\" before closing in July 1916.\nIn 1921, a drive-in was opened by Claude V. Caver in Comanche, Texas. Caver obtained a permit from the city to project films downtown. With cars parked bumper-to-bumper, patrons witnessed the screening of silent films from their vehicles. In the 1920s, \"outdoor movies\" became a popular summer entertainment, but relatively few \"drive-in\" experiments were made due to logistical difficulties.\n\nThe drive-in theater was patented in Camden, New Jersey by chemical company magnate Richard M. Hollingshead, Jr., whose family owned and operated the R.M. Hollingshead Corporation chemical plant in Camden. In 1932, Hollingshead conducted outdoor theater tests in his driveway at 212 Thomas Avenue in Riverton. After nailing a screen to trees in his backyard, he set a 1928 Kodak projector on the hood of his car and put a radio behind the screen, testing different sound levels with his car windows down and up. Blocks under vehicles in the driveway enabled him to determine the size and spacing of ramps so all automobiles could have a clear view of the screen. Hollingshead applied for a patent of his invention on August 6, 1932, and he was given on May 16, 1933.\n\nHollingshead's drive-in opened in New Jersey June 6, 1933, on Admiral Wilson Boulevard in Pennsauken Township, a short distance from Cooper River Park. Rosemont Avenue now runs through where the theater was. It offered 400 slots and a screen. He advertised his drive-in theater with the slogan, \"The whole family is welcome, regardless of how noisy the children are.\" The first film shown was the Adolphe Menjou film \"Wife Beware\". Failing to make a profit, Hollingshead sold the theater after three years to a Union, New Jersey theater owner who moved the infrastructure to that city, but the concept caught on nationwide.\n\nThe April 15, 1934, opening of Shankweiler's Auto Park in Orefield, Pennsylvania, was followed by Galveston's Drive-In Short Reel Theater (July 5, 1934), the Pico Drive-In Theater at Pico and Westwood boulevards in Los Angeles (September 9, 1934) and the Weymouth Drive-In Theatre in Weymouth, Massachusetts (May 6, 1936). In 1937, three more opened in Ohio, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, with another 12 during 1938 and 1939 in California, Florida, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Texas and Virginia.\n\nEarly drive-in theaters had to deal with sound issues. The original Hollingshead drive-in had speakers installed on the tower itself which caused a sound delay affecting patrons at the rear of the drive-in's field. In 1935, the Pico Drive-in Theater attempted to solve this problem by having a row of speakers in front of the cars. In 1941, RCA introduced in-car speakers with individual volume controls which solved the noise pollution issue and provided satisfactory sound to drive-in patrons. Just before World War II, 9 of the 15 drive-in movie theaters open in the United States were operated by Philip Smith, who promoted a family-friendly environment by allowing children to enter free and built playgrounds.\n\nThe drive-in's peak popularity came in the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly in rural areas, with some 4,000 drive-ins spread across the United States. Among its advantages was the fact that older adults with children could take care of their infant while watching a movie, while youth found drive-ins ideal for a first date. Revenue is more limited than regular theaters since showings can only begin at twilight. There were abortive attempts to create suitable conditions for daylight viewing such as large tent structures, but nothing viable was developed.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the greater privacy afforded to patrons gave drive-ins a reputation as immoral, and they were labeled \"passion pits\" in the media. Beginning in the 1970s, many drive-ins changed from family fare to exploitation films, as a way to offset declining patronage and revenue. Also, during the 1970s, some drive-ins began to show pornographic movies in less family-centered time slots to bring in extra income. This allowed censored materials to be viewed by a wide audience, some for whom viewing was still illegal in many states, and it was reliant upon the whims of local ordinances controlling such material. It also required a relatively remote location distant from populated areas such as towns and cities.\nDuring their height, some drive-ins used attention-grabbing gimmicks to boost attendance. They ranged from drawings for prizes and free admission, small airplane runways, unusual attractions such as a small petting zoo or cage of monkeys, personal appearances by actors to open their movies, or musical groups to play before the show. Some drive-ins held Sunday religious services, or charged a flat price per car on slow nights like Wednesdays or Sundays. On \"buck\" nights during the 1950s and 1960s, the admission price was one dollar per car.\n\nOne of the largest drive-in theaters was the Johnny All-Weather Drive-In in Copiague, New York. Covering over 29 acres, it could park 2,500 vehicles. It had a full-service restaurant with seating on the roof, and a trolley system to take children and adults to a playground and a large indoor theater for bad weather or for those who wanted to watch in air-conditioned comfort.\n\nThe shift in content of drive-ins was less of an issue than competition from home entertainment, from color television to VCRs and video rentals. As well, the 1970s energy crisis led to a sharp decline of attendance, combined with the widespread adoption of daylight saving time (which made the shows start an hour later). These changes made it harder for drive-ins to operate successfully. Real estate interest rate hikes in the eighties made the large land tracts increasingly expensive, and thus far too valuable for businesses such as drive-ins, which were often open only in the summer months. Drive-ins were also subject to the whim of nature as inclement weather often caused poor attendance or cancellations. Fewer than two hundred drive-ins were in operation in the U.S. and Canada by the late eighties. Since the nineties they have lapsed into a quasi-novelty status with the remaining handful catering to a generally nostalgic audience, with many drive-ins continuing to successfully operate in some areas, mostly on the West Coast. By 2013, drive-ins comprised only 1.5 percent of movie screens in the United States, with 389 theaters in operation. At the industry's height, about 25 percent of the nation's movie screens were found at a drive-in.\n\nMany drive-in movie sites remain, but re-purposed as storage or flea market sites, often after residential housing or other higher value uses came to the lightly populated or unpopulated areas where the drive-ins were located. The largest drive-in theater in the world, the Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop, doubles as the world's largest daily flea market. Former drive-in properties in Michigan have become industrial parks, shopping centers, indoor theaters, and even churches (as with the Former Woodland Drive-In in Grand Rapids, MI). In Philadelphia, the South City Drive In became the location of the original Spectrum in the late 1960s, with a small portion of its old property line extending into what would become the (now demolished) Veterans Stadium complex. (Today that small portion, combined with the original Spectrum location, is part of Xfinity Live! Philadelphia.) Another example of a drive in-turned-flea market is Spotlight 88 in North Sewickley Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, which ended business as a drive-in after an F3 tornado destroyed much of the property on May 31, 1985. As a joke after the tornado hit, the owners put up in the \"now-showing\" sign \"Gone with the Wind\". It was most likely copied from a Taylor, Michigan Drive in called Ecorse Drive-In. On July 16, 1980, a freak derecho storm with 150 mph straight line winds swept the Drive-In away leaving only the \"now-showing\" sign with the letters \"Now Playing Gone with the Wind\". They rebuilt the screen, but it never recovered; by 1989, it was sold and now is a Kroger grocery store.\n\nThe resurgence of the industry of the late 1990s led to the inception of the \"do-it-yourself\" drive-in beginning in 2001, which utilized contemporary tools such as LCD projectors and micro-radio transmitters. The first was the Liberation Drive-In in Oakland, California, which sought to reclaim under-utilized urban spaces such as vacant parking lots in the downtown area. The following years have seen the rise of the \"guerrilla drive-in\" movement, in which groups of dedicated individuals orchestrate similar outdoor film and video screenings. Showings are often organized online, and participants meet at specified locations to watch films projected on bridge pillars or warehouses. The content featured at these screenings has frequently been independent or experimental films, cult movies, or otherwise alternative programming. The best known \"guerrilla\" drive-ins include the Santa Cruz Guerilla Drive-In in Santa Cruz, California, North Bay Mobile Drive-In in Novato, California, MobMov in San Francisco, California and Hollywood, and most recently Guerilla Drive-In Victoria in Victoria, British Columbia.\n\nFaced with the closure of Hull's Drive In in Lexington, Virginia, in 1999, the non-profit group Hull's Angels formed to raise funds, buy the property and operate the theater as a non-profit venture specializing in family-friendly films. Hull's continues to be the nation's only non-profit drive-in.\n\n, a figure of 348 drive-ins has been published for the United States. In fall 2014, the burger chain Johnny Rockets announced that it would team up with USA Drive-Ins to open 200 drive-ins by 2018 serving Johnny Rocket's food at the concession stands.\n\nThe ongoing conversion of the film distribution network to be exclusively digital distribution is also putting additional pressure on drive-in theaters. Most small drive-ins lack the finances (beginning at $70,000 per screen) needed to convert to digital projection. The lack of multiple screens with many daily showings means the low volume of ticket sales will make it hard for many drive-ins to justify the cost of installing digital projection.\n\nConversion of the projection booth to digital is more complex for drive-in theaters. The projector needs a more powerful bulb due to an increased screen size and light pollution. In addition, digital projection equipment may require an Internet connection, and the booth must be retrofitted with special glass, more vents and stronger air conditioning as well as heat in northern climates.\n\nWith installation of Jumbotrons or similar digital display equipment in drive-in theatres, restrictions of the projector booth can be avoided; that is, no projector is needed.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "301456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301456", "title": "Happy ending", "text": "Happy ending\n\nA happy ending is an ending of the plot of a work of fiction in which almost everything turns out for the best for the protagonists, their sidekicks, and almost everyone except the villains.\n\nIn storylines where the protagonists are in physical danger, a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the quest or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers consummating their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In Steven Spielberg's version of \"War of the Worlds\", the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; \"and\" the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience's feeling of satisfaction in the end. \n\nA happy ending is epitomized in the standard fairy tale ending phrase, \"happily ever after\" or \"and they lived happily ever after\". (\"One Thousand and One Nights\" has the more restrained formula \"they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness\" (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with \"they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day\".) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film \"Star Wars\", Luke Skywalker defeats the Galactic Empire by destroying the Death Star; however, the story's happy ending has consequences that follow in \"The Empire Strikes Back\". The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the Stephen King fantasy/fairy tale novel \"The Eyes of the Dragon\" which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that \"there were good days and bad days\" afterwards.\n\nA happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. Roger Ebert comments in his review of Roland Emmerich's \"The Day After Tomorrow\": \"Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and lots of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall's little cancer patient.\"\n\nThe presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish melodrama from tragedy. In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as \"Macbeth\" or \"Oedipus Rex\", in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked. In the Seventeenth Century, the Irish author Nahum Tate sought to improve William Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" in his own heavily modified version in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate's version dominated performances for a century and a half, Shakespeare's original nearly forgotten. Both David Garrick and John Philip Kemble, while taking up some of Shakespeare's original text, kept Tate's happy ending. Edmund Kean played \"King Lear\" with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did William Macready at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare's original tragic end – Helen Faucit's final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play's tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate's amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare's original. Happy endings have also been fastened – equally, with no lasting success – to \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Othello\". \n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of what a happy ending is; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of \"The Merchant of Venice\"s forced conversion of Shylock to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. Romans 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience's prejudices.\n\nMost interpretations of the legend of Don Juan end with the protagonist rake being dragged off to Hell, in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\"). However, José Zorrilla - whose 1844 play \"Don Juan Tenorio\" is the version most well-known in the Spanish-speaking world - believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla's depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Doña Inés, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan's - thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to Paradise.\n\nA \"Times\" review of \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\" strongly criticized John le Carré for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: \"The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as Jack must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.\"\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his \"Pygmalion\" have a happy ending, i.e. that Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolitle would ultimately get married. To Shaw's great chagrin, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] who presented the play in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1914 had sweetened the ending and told Shaw: \"My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful. Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot.\" The irritated Shaw added a postscript essay, \"'What Happened Afterwards\", to the 1916 print edition, for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why in his view it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married. Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film \"[[My Fair Lady]]\".\n\nIn numerous cases, [[Hollywood]] studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. \n\n\n[[Category:Endings]]\n[[Category:Narratology]]\n[[Category:Fiction]]\n[[Category:Plot (narrative)]]\n[[Category:Recurrent elements in fairy tales]]"}
{"id": "18718287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18718287", "title": "Irish Radio Transmitters Society", "text": "Irish Radio Transmitters Society\n\nThe Irish Radio Transmitters Society (IRTS) is a national non-profit organization for amateur radio enthusiasts in Ireland. Key missions of the IRTS include promoting amateur radio experimentation and representing the interests of Irish amateur radio operators before Irish and international telecommunications regulatory authorities. In particular, since 2005 in agreement with Communications Regulator (Comreg), the IRTS supports the entire examination process for the Experimenter's Licence including setting, organising, and correcting examinations for the Irish amateur radio license. The organization has no paid employees, and all tasks are performed by volunteers. IRTS is the national member society representing Ireland in the International Amateur Radio Union.\n\nRadio in Ireland can be traced back to the 1800s with Professor George Francis Fitzgerald of TCD who in conjunction with Heinrich Hertz clarified and confirmed James Clerk Maxwell's mathematical theories of the electromagnetic field. This work led Fitzgerald to conclude in 1883 that an oscillating electric current would produce electromagnetic waves, which was experimentally confirmed by Heinrich Hertz in 1888 and used in the development of wireless telegraphy. Fitzgerald was the first to suggest a method of producing radio frequency waves which forms the basis for modern radio. An early pioneer of experimental radio in Ireland was Colonel M.J.B. Dennis who in 1898 at his home in Baltinglass, Co. Wicklow carried out experiments into radio transmissions. In 1913 he was one of the founding members of the Dublin Wireless Club. In 1922 the Radio Society of Ireland was founded as a National Society. The National Society and the Dublin Wireless club merged into the Wireless Society of Ireland in 1925, by this time broadcast radio was becoming popular, and a year later the first National Station 2RN started broadcasting. The original \"Irish Radio Transmitters Society\" was formed in 1926 by members of the WSI who were more interested in the construction of amateur transmitters and receivers rather than broadcast equipment.  The IRTS that exists today consists of an amalgamation in 1932 of this group with the Wireless Society of Ireland. The first president of IRTS was Colonel Dennis, who by then had the call sign EI2B. He held office for many years and was active in amateur affairs until the war brought a stop to these in 1939. Colonel Dennis died in 1945 in his early eighties.\n\nThe IRTS produces a magazine \"Echo Ireland\", detailing activities and information about Amateur Radio in Ireland, which is available to all members by post or online. A weekly news service is also broadcast on amateur radio frequencies. Members may use the QSL card service and avail of the technical panel for help in with aspects of amateur radio. Throughout the year the society organises amateur radio contests on frequencies from 70 cm to 80m.\n\nSince 2005 the IRTS supports the entire examination process for the Experimenter's Licence. The society provides a course guide for the CEPT Class B exam and examinations are held twice yearly. A separate morse code test can be arranged for those wanting to obtain a CEPT Class A license, which allows the operator to apply for a two letter callsign and may allow the operator to operate equipment in countries where morse code is still a requirement. Membership of the IRTS is not required to sit these exams.\n\n"}

Cooper\n\nJohn Walcott Cooper, Jr. (February 17, 1873 – 1966) was an African-American ventriloquist, entertainer, and singer with the Southern Jubilee Singers. He was known as the \"Black Napoleon of Ventriloquism\" and also performed under the pseudonym Hezekiah Jones. Over the course of his lifetime Cooper was a member of the Negro Actors Guild of America, the Colored Vaudeville Benevolent Association, and the International Brotherhood of Ventriloquists. \n\nHe was born in 1873 in Brooklyn to John Walcott Cooper, Sr. and Annie Morris. His parents originally lived in the southern part of the United States; John Cooper Sr. was originally from Beaufort, South Carolina, and Annie Morris was originally from Georgia. In 1871, the family moved North.\n\nHe dropped out of school in the third grade at age 8, in 1881.\n\nBefore his 13th birthday, in 1886, both of Cooper's parents died. Cooper took on a job as an exercise boy at Sheepshead Bay Race Track in Brooklyn. While working at Sheepshead Bay Race Track, Cooper met an unidentified white ventriloquist who introduced him to his first exposure of this form of entertainment. The ventriloquist attempted to convince and frighten Cooper into believing that the horses he was working with could talk. This was one of the various examples that many speculate prompted Cooper to become a ventriloquist.\n\nJohn W. Cooper began his career in 1886 with the Southern Jubilee Singers, touring parts of New England, Canada, and the Mid-Atlantic States for four years. While he toured with the Southern Jubilee Singers, he began to formulate his ventriloquism act. Cooper wrote and performed his pieces in front of predominantly white audiences.\n\nIn 1900-01, Cooper joined Richards and Pringles Georgia Minstrels. Unlike the other minstrel performers in the group, Cooper performed as a ventriloquist and did not wear blackface as part of their act. The minstrels, an act that got its start in the 1830s before vaudeville and burlesque, typically participated in an overtly racist style of performance known as blackfacing in which the singers and dancers would paint their faces with black cosmetics that mocked African Americans. Cooper essentially performed in minstrel shows but was not a minstrel himself and introduced a performance style that contrasted blackfacing. After touring with Richards and Pringles Georgia Minstrels, he became known as “the Black Napoleon of ventriloquism.” He then joined Rusco and Holland's Big Minstrel Festival at the end of 1901.\n\nIn 1902, Cooper participated in independent performances. One of his most famous acts was \"Fun in a Barber Shop.\" This act involved five different puppet characters where Cooper portrayed each one in different voices. It was a scene that took place in a barbershop for whites with black employees. Cooper operated all five dummies and the projection of six voices. The extra voice was his, as he also had a role in the performance. In this scene, he multitasked by one of the dummies \"cut the customer's hair\" with his hands while using his feet to operate the other dummies. Two of the dummies were customers who talked while waiting their turn as well as a manicurist who sang while doing the fifth dummy’s nails.\n\nCooper's break into the vaudeville circuit came as a result of a white vaudeville union's strike in 1901. The White Rats, the notorious name for the white vaudeville union, was facing administrative issues where performers could not reach any sort of negotiation with their managers in the heavily monopolized business.\n\nIn the meantime, Cooper ignored the strike and in the desperate need for talent during the strike, he became a fixture on the vaudeville circuit. This led to performances on many radio shows throughout the rest of his life including a weekly performances while touring with the troupe \"The Major Bowes Original Amateur Hour.\"\n\nDuring the 1920s, Cooper was the lead performer in a group of five performers called “Father Quinn’s Entertainers.” Throughout this decade, they toured the Catholic Churches in the United States. By the 1930s, a decline in the popularity of Vaudeville occurred. After twenty years of performing in clubs, halls, and theaters, Cooper began to tour alone with his dummy named Sam Jackson. For the rest of his career, he and Sam provided entertainment to children in the homes of wealthy patrons and in the hospitals of New York City. In 1960, at the age of 86, Cooper retired from show business.\n\nThrough the later part of his vaudeville days in the 1930s, parts of Cooper's act featured his dummy Sam Jackson. Often claiming Sam was a \"cousin\" of Charlie McCarthy, the famous dummy of Edgar Bergen, background research performed as part of a PBS series discovered that both McCarthy and Jackson were made by Theodore Mack, a prominent puppet maker from Chicago.\n\nThe puppet also had a variety of fairly large features such as enlarged eyes. Dummies featured large features because audiences would be packed into large theaters and the enlarged features allowed audiences from as far back as the balcony to enjoy the show.\n\nJohn W. Cooper, now under the alias Hezikiah Jones, and Sam toured the country with The Major Bowes Original Amateur Hour. A few years later during World War II, Cooper and Sam independently performed in veterans hospitals as well as in the USO camp shows across the country. Alongside this, they made appearances at private parties and nightclubs including the well-known Kit-Kat and El Morocco clubs in New York City.\n\nHe died in April 1966 in Brooklyn.\n\nBecause dummies like Sam Jackson were used so often, it was not uncommon that performers would replace them with new figures. Presently, John W. Cooper's daughter, Joan Maynard, is the custodian of Sam Jackson. It is widely speculated that the Sam Jackson she has today is the same one that Cooper used many years ago. In order to promote his legacy, Maynard set up exhibits about her father at the Brooklyn Historical Society. A series of documents and files containing genealogical information as well as letters sent to John W. Cooper during his career are parts of the exhibits. There are also various scripts and writings by cooper relaying a dialogue between him and Sam.\n\nCurrent speculations about Sam Jackson are verified in the televised program by Alan Semok, a recognized expert in the field of puppets and particularly ventriloquial figures (in addition to being an actor and voice artist, Semok is well known within the profession as \"The Dummy Doctor\"). It has been determined that Sam in fact predates Charlie McCarthy, possibly by as much as ten years, although the exact span of time remains unclear.\n\n"}

It was formed by Kazuko Hillyer in 1970. It arranged tours for a variety of clients, including the Tokyo String Quartet, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Grand Kabuki, the Jewish Theater of Romania and the Zambia National Folk and Music Ensemble.\n\nThe business was at first run out of the apartment Kazuko Hillyer shared with her husband, Juilliard String Quartet co-founder Raphael Hillyer. An early success was a successful arrangement in 1972 with musicians in East Germany, which was before that time closed to cultural exchanges with the West. By 1975 the Hillyer organization represented 50 conductors and soloists and 20 orchestras worldwide.\n\nThe company was notably responsible for organizing the Metropolitan Opera's first tour to Japan in May–June 1975. Hillyer successfully brokered a sponsorship deal for the tour with the Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting Company. The Met, which at the time was experiencing financial difficulties, jumped at a chance for three weeks of opera performances that had all costs covered and generated income for the company. The company toured Japan for three weeks, giving performances in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya.\n\nGeneral director Schuyler Chapin and Hillyer were able to secure many of the world's leading opera singers for the tour. Their production of \"La traviata\" starred Joan Sutherland as Violetta and Robert Merrill as Germont with Sutherland's husband, Richard Bonynge, conducting. Marilyn Horne portrayed the title role in \"Carmen\" for the tour with conductor Henry Lewis, Lucine Amara is Micaela, and James McCracken as Don José. The role of Rodolfo in the tour's \"La bohème\" was alternated in performances between tenors Franco Corelli and Luciano Pavarotti with Dorothy Kirsten as Mimi.\n\nIn 1992, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which was soon converted to Chapter 7.\n"}
{"id": "30792823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30792823", "title": "Liberature", "text": "Liberature\n\nLiberature is literature in which the material form is considered an important part of the whole and essential to understanding the work.\n\nLiberature refers to a new kind of literature, a trans-genre, in which the text and the material form of a book constitute an inseparable whole. The term itself is derived from the word ‘literature’, but draws from the Latin \"liber\", meaning \"a book\" and \"the free one\", as well as libra meaning \"measurement\" or \"writing as a measurement of words.\" In a work of liberature, text does not serve as the sole source of meaning; the shape and the construction of the book, its format, the number of pages, its typographical layout, the size and type of the font applied, pictures and photographs integrated with the text, and type of paper or other material used in the process of creation of the book are all taken into consideration. The reader confronts a work of liberature as a total package, which often assumes a non-traditional shape, the quality of which, in practice, sometime involves a radical separation from the traditional design of the book. Its textual message dictates the physical shape that the work finally assumes. All of this lends a level of intent and control to the creator of liberature that surpasses that of other genres.\n\nThe demands posed by liberature shape a new kind of reader. In traditional texts, the reader empirically processes the text of a work in order to attain a desired level of understanding; one follows the steps of a model reader, whose purpose is to bring oneself closer to one’s virtual model. Certain works diverge from this concept of linear, textual reading such as those by Umberto Eco or Roland Barthes. Such works introduce uncertainty into these structured expectations and programs of behavior. Neither the works of Eco nor Barthes constitute liberature, but they exemplify a difference in the quality of the programming of the reader’s experience.\n\nThe printed works of liberature, although diverse in the application, share the following variables of the traversal function:\n\nOnly in several instances the work may breach the above-mentioned scheme of characteristic variables of liberature. In all other cases, readers are responsible for configuring their reading of the text.\nTexts of liberature that generate multiple statements are not limited to literary works, and definitely not to electronic texts – the category embraces computer games and other forms of both ergodic and non‐ergodic literature. The former requires a non‐trivial effort to traverse the text. In a classical, non-ergodic literary work, such as The Odyssey, the reader is required only to turn the pages and to interpret the text.\nIn permutative works – those in which the order of text is inconsequential - instead of static function defining the dynamics, something else occurs. An intratextonic dynamic, one that guides the reader throughout the text, occurs. The text is also not determinate, meaning that it lacks a specificity which would hinder interpretation and different readings. The ergodic character of the work is usually determined by the exploratory function of the reader.\nThe parallel character of the works is written into the very core of liberature; the order in which the reader perceives the text governs the way the work is rendered. The interactive capacity of the work becomes, if not an aesthetic category, a way of the reader’s behavior that is written into the text. The work of liberature disrupts the structure of expectations based on a syntagmatic order as well as the strategies characteristic of a linear text. The works of liberature refer to the experience of simultaneousness. Furthermore, liberature as a hybrid genre incorporating the features of numerous media at the same time, including the arts, assumes a quality of simultaneousness as a dominating one.\n\nIn 1999, Zenon Fajfer postulated the genre of liberature to describe the yet-undefinable work \"Oka-leczenie\" that he and Katarzyna Bazarnik had been working on. In a translated explanation of the concept, Fajfer describes liberature as “a type or genre of literature in which the text is integrated with the physical space of the book into a meaningful whole and in which all elements (from the graphic ones to the kinds of paper (or other material) and the physical shape of the book) may contribute to its meaning.” Fajfer specifically cites the necessity of creating the genre because he too often sees non-traditional literary works judged only as works of art, but not as literature. After conception, the idea was developed by Katarzyna Bazarnik who, basing her reflections on the analysis of the works by James Joyce, demonstrated that the similarity of the text and the form creates iconicity. By exploring and dynamically developing the study of iconicity, a common feature of liberature, Bazarnik contributed to the consideration of liberature in the literary community at large.\n\nFajfer's ‘liberature’ is in no immediate denotational relation with various earlier uses of the word, including the English legal synonym for “livery”, the name of a program of Czech Radio, and the term coined by Julián Ríos for the novel \"Larva\" (1983).\n\nConsidering liberature anachronistically, it is noteworthy that writers began experimenting with literary forms as early as in the Baroque period. The unusual structure of the works forces the readers to focus their attention, to choose the beginning and the end of the text, and – most importantly – form another level of signification. It is an invitation to play, act, and interact with the text; this enables the text to transcend the boundaries of a given work. Its form “does not only consider a literary text a symbolic expression of a person’s subjectivity but also considered a text as determined by the level of programming and processing of signs.”\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, word‐games (such as rebuses, palindromes, and anagrams), all of which date back to antiquity, were employed. There were also text‐machines, texts that after being programmed were able to generate new texts. The similarity of various literary works from this period was a result of fashion, but also of using the same Latin books on poetry and rhetoric in which creating elaborate poetry, and later, prose, was one of the practice exercises.\n\nThe works that may be considered liberature \"avant la lettre\" were penned by such writers as William Blake, Blaise Cendrars, B.S. Johnson, James Joyce, Stéphane Mallarmé, Raymond Queneau, Laurence Sterne, or Stanisław Wyspiański. In the case of American postmodernist writers, Raymond Federman, Robert Gass and Ronald Sukenick come to the fore of what can be called liberature.\n\nIn Poland, some of Radosław Nowakowski's works predated the coinage of the term. Owing to discussions with Fajfer, Nowakowski found the term useful and started considering himself a writer of liberature.\n\nOne of Nowakowski’s most prominent works is \"Ulica Sienkiewicza w Kielcach\" (\"Sienkiewicz Street in Kielce\") published in 2002. \nAnother of Nowakowski’s books, \"Nieposkładana teoria sztuki\" (\"Noncompleted Theory of Art\"), first published in 1994, is composed of a pile of separate pages placed in a box which, according to the author, mirrors the “theory of puzzle[...] [w]ith the exception that not all of the elements fit[...]”.\nIn the works where Nowakowski provides the reader with three versions of the text – Polish, English and Esperanto – one could observe certain differences in the rendition of the same topic, the technique which contributes to the further differentiation of the book’s meaning.\n\nIn an organized manner, liberature in Poland, including both Polish texts and translated work, has been presented in the Liberatura series published by Korporacja Ha!art seated in Kraków. The first publications are:\n\n(1) Katarzyna Bazarnik and Zenon Fajfer. \"(O)patrzenie.\" 2003.\n\n(2) Zenon Fajfer. \"Spoglądając przez ozonową dziurę.\" 2004.

Foer's hybrid, postmodern novel \"Tree of Codes\" (2010) is an example of visual writing, utilizing typesetting, images, spaces and blank pages to give the book a visual dimension beyond the prose narrative. Foer has taken his favorite book, \"The Street of Crocodiles\" by Bruno Schulz, and used it as a canvas, cutting into and out of the pages, to arrive at an original new story. In one interview the author emphasises that, although the originality of the story brought to life in such an innovative way is a very compelling feature, it was the form of the book that captivated him the most: “[…] I was more interested in subtracting than adding, and also in creating a book with a three-dimensional life. On the brink of the end of paper, I was attracted to the idea of a book that can’t forget it has a body.”\n\nAlthough the authors creating liberature frequently apply the traditional ways of publication (chiefly paper books), they also appreciate other possibilities. Liberatic texts whose primary medium is the Internet are representative of ‘e-liberature’.\nOther examples include Radosław Nowakowski's works, such as the transformation of the hypertext model of the book by Nowakowski into Hala 1000 Ton, set in the old Norblin’s factory (Warsaw) (2005). The project called Libro 2N, was defined as a \"journey into BLIN concept\", which was enacted inside a book represented by the old workshop.\n\n"}

The phrase \"Lions, tigers and bears\" is from Dorothy in \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939).\n\nThe story features the adventures of a young boy named \"Joey Price\" who discovers that his stuffed animals can come to life to protect him from The Beasties, monsters who come out of his closet to get him in the middle of the night.\n\n\"A child’s instinctual need for the comfort of a stuffed animal is rooted in a reality long forgotten by the adult world. The hidden truth is that these companions have been defending children since the dawn of time. Follow young Joey on the adventure of a lifetime as he travels through the Stuffed Animal Kingdom, a journey that puts the fate of all the world's children in his hands and brings him face to face with his destiny.\"\n\nJoey Price. The main protagonist Joey is an eight-year-old boy who lives with his single mother. Joey is very daring and adventurous, but like most eight-year-olds, can be easily frightened by the larger world around him. After moving away from the house he grew up in, his Grandmother gives him the boxed Night Pride, a set of four stuffed animals, who will later come to life to protect him from the evil Beasties. \n\nCourtney Donlolley. Courtney is the nine-year-old daughter of Abner Donlolley, maker of the Stuffed Animal Kingdom stuffed animals. As such, she's often the target of Beastie schemes. Courtney and Joey have rapidly become close friends and are often found together.\n\nAres, the Bengal tiger . Ares is the muscle of the Night Pride. His personality is more dynamic than Pallo’s, as he lets his semi-sarcastic sense of humor seep into his dealings. Regardless of his seemingly, less serious outlook, Ares is just as duty bound as Pallo and will stand beside Pallo until the very end, no matter the cost. By the end of volume I, Ares is Joey's new best friend.\n\nVenus, the Bengal tigress. Venus is second-in-command of the Night Pride. Her strong will and sense of purpose are tempered by her caring heart and empathic nature. Her affection can be seen when she is with another member of the Pride or one of her many friends in the Stuffed Animal Kingdom. Her strength shines through when dealing with the Beasties or other threats to her charges. Every animal in the Kingdom knows of her kind heart and every Beastie fears her name. \n\nPallo, the lion. Pallo is the leader of the Night Pride. He is fearless, commanding, decisive and intelligent. His no-nonsense approach to leading the Night Pride has rapidly made him one of the most revered commanders in the Stuffed Animal Militia. His sense of duty is unerring and his dedication to his tasks unyielding. \n\nMinerva, the black leopardess. Minerva is the stealth agent of the Pride, spending most of her time gliding through the shadows. This makes her something of a loner; however, she is still an essential member of the Night Pride. While her strength and ferocity are legendary, so too is her compassion and the only thing more renowned is her sarcasm. Don’t fear the shadows when you sleep, for Minerva guards them making sure no Beastie will tread there.\n\nKing Bear. The ruler of the Stuffed Animal Kingdom\n\nGrumble. Grumble is the older brother of Mumbler. He gets his name from his temperament, always unhappy, always complaining about this and that. He loves nothing more than to devour small children, but if he’s not doing that, his favorite thing to do is complain. \n\nMumbler. Mumbler is more reserved than Grumble, but has his own sense of mean-ness that he exhibits in his twisted sense of humor. Mumbler derives great pleasure from the discomfort of others, especially Grumble. Mumbler is hard to understand, however, as his giant front teeth muffle his voice terribly, thus making it very hard to figure out what he’s saying. \n\nGrok. Grok is second in command of the Beasties. His terrible temper suits the needs of his boss, Valthraax. The only thing more ferocious than Grok’s anger is his hunger for children. \n\nValthraax The main antagonist Valthraax is a humanoid spider dressed in Victorian clothes and the leader of the Beasties whose role is very similar to that of the boogeyman, some say, a relative of Abner Donlolley who was cursed to walk the Kingdom as Lord of the Beasties. His only desire is to rid the Kingdom of Stuffed Animals so that he can harvest the children of our world for his own selfish appetite.\n\nThe first volume, a four-issue mini series, was released by Image Comics from February 2005 to May 2005, with each issue selling out in weeks to days to hours.

{"id": "23297339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23297339", "title": "Martoys", "text": "Martoys\n\nMartoys was a diecast toy car company founded close to Milan, Italy, in 1974. It specialized in a series of 1:24 scale metal cars with many opening.features After only two years, the brand name was changed to Bburago, thus Martoys models are rather rare today. \n\nMartoys was founded by the Besana brothers, Ugo, Martino, and Mario, who sold their first well-known brand Mebetoys to Mattel (Gran Toros website). For this brand new line, only models in 1:24 scale were produced. In 1976, after only two years, the Besanas renamed the brand Bburago (with two 'B's at the beginning of the name). It is said that the change came because of possible confusion with the classic toy maker Marx Toys, where the 'X' in the logo was often not noticed, thus Marx sometimes being referred to as 'Mar Toys' (Gran Toros website; MarXToys website).\n\nAccording to the 1975 catalog, there were only nine basic models in the Martoys line-up, though most of these were offered in at least a couple of versions (Martoys 1975). These models were: Renault Alpine (and Alpine rally), Porsche 911 (S, Carrera RS, and \"Polizei\"), FIAT 127 (plain, \"vigili urbani\", and rally), Lancia Stratos (Marlboro or Alitalia), Range Rover (plain and airport fire), Renault 5, BMW 3.0 CS, Lancia Beta, and Audi 80GT (Martoys 1975; Sinclair's 1976). \n\nIn that catalog, the Audi, BMW, Lancia Beta, Renault 5 and Range Rover were portrayed with photographs of real vehicles, not the models, so there is some doubt about whether all the proposed line was produced as Martoys, or if some were as yet under development - to be later introduced after the name change to Bburago. A FIAT 131 (plain and Carabinieri) was also apparently produced, but it was not shown in the 1975 catalog. A newsletter/flyer from David Sinclair, perhaps the earliest importer of Martoys to the United States, reported all of the above were available except the Lancia Beta (listed as available later) and the FIAT 131 (not listed at all, see Sinclairs 1976; Levine 2009). The 131 appears to have been the last model to reach production under the Martoys label. \nModels were attractive and well-done but this was when larger scales were just becoming (along with Polistil) popular as toys for easier rending of details - yet before collector and consumer demand for near perfect rendition occurred through the 1990s (Sinclair's 1976). So, some of the Martoys line simply did not look right. The frames on the opening doors of the FIAT 127 were thick, unrefined and appeared toy-like. The BMW 3.0 CS simply could not capture the delicate fender curves of the real car and grille proportions were squarish. The subtle lines that defined the beauty of the real machine that Alexander Calder went on to decorate were lost on the Martoys model. \n\nThe Porsche 911 was very nicely done, both in engine, body, lights and script and logo detail. With a little bit of trim paint the model was stunning (Sinclair's 1976). Nevertheless, the Porsche's roof line and rear quarters do not appear perfectly captured.\n\nMartoys boxes had two different card-box designs. The older one featured accentuated rounded graphic letters popular in the 1970s. The lettering was overlapped and staggered on top of itself four times, starting with a dark purple blue in the background and fading to lighter and lighter green on top, the 'O' in Martoys formed a three-ring red bulls eye that looked like the Target store symbol. The design was colorful and not subtle - it was more toy-like than collector-like. \n\nThe boxes featured a picture of the \"model\" and not usually the real car (in contrast to fellow Italian manufacturer Polistil's S series which had actual photos of the real automobile). Later, all models had a white box with less flamboyant graphics. As with Polistil's S-series, box designs did not have the transparent plastic window to see the real model inside that became the standard for all larger scale toys later on. Printed on the bottom panel of the box were specifications of the real car, and if you were lucky the catalog came inside.\n\nA couple of years after Mebetoys was sold to Mattel, the Besana brothers made plans to form the new company. Martoys, however, never had the chance to develop a firm image for itself. When the name was changed, none of the graphics or signage was kept. All was abandoned for the new Bburago look. Bburago's trek, even under an onslaught of larger scale toys and collectibles has lasted since 1976, though it was finally acquired by the Asian company Maisto in 2008. A perusal of the company history and vision on the official Bburago website says nothing about Martoys (Bburago website), though one could say Martoys was in many ways responsible for the big trend in larger scale diecast that was to become the rage in the 1980s and 1990s. \n\nThe Gran Toros website reports that Martino Besana died around 1993. As of 2008, Mario was suffering from cancer, but Ugo was in good health. Ugo (now in his 80s) and his wife had founded Vivien Company making toy irons and ironing boards - products similar to those made in the early days of Mebetoys (Gran Toros website).\n\nBburago Website. http://www.bburago.com/index.php\n\nGran Toros Website. http://www.grantoros.com\n\nLevine, R.

However, whereas the Muppets characterize positivity, naïve folly and innocence, the Feebles largely present negativity, vice and other misanthropic characteristics.

Meanwhile, Robert (a hedgehog), the newest member of the team, arrives at the theatre and immediately falls in love with another newcomer, Lucille (a poodle). Samantha confronts Heidi, insults her, and reveals her relationship with Bletch. Robert confesses his love to Lucille, and the two become engaged. Sid (an elephant) receives a visit from his ex-girlfriend Sandy (a chicken) with his alleged son Seymour (an improbable-looking elephant/chicken hybrid). Sandy informs him she will be preparing a paternity case against him.\n\nAt the toilet, the second most important star of the show, Harry (a hare), is suffering from a mystery disease, given only twelve hours to live. Meanwhile, drug-addicted knife thrower Wynyard (a frog) tells Robert his story of Vietnam, and convinces Robert to give him $50 to buy drugs from Trevor. After seeing Trevor's latest porno film, Bletch decides they need a new porn star, and Trevor chooses Lucille; he drugs her and tries to rape her as an audition but is caught by Robert. When he walks in on the scene Robert thinks that Lucille was drinking and throwing herself at Trevor, and tells her he never wants to see her again.\n\nAfter a good beginning – the Feebles sign with a TV chain to appear in a prime-time television show – Bletch confesses to Heidi that he actually hates her and wants to give the main role to Samantha. After trying unsuccessfully to commit suicide, Heidi goes on a shooting spree and kills many of the cast, including Harry who was told by his doctor that he was indeed going to recover.\n\nThe epilogue reveals the fates of only six survivors: Sid gets extensive repair on his kneecaps after being shot by Heidi and works in an orchard as a struggling horticulturist with Seymour. Arthur received an OBE for his lifelong service at the theater and retires to the country. Sebastian recovers from his injuries and achieved worldwide fame for his best seller \"The Feeble Variety Massacre: One Man's Act of Heroism!\" and is negotiating film rights. Robert, now an award-winning fashion photographer for a women's magazine, and Lucille are married with two children. Finally, Heidi, whose killing spree resulted in her imprisonment in a women's penitentiary for ten years (implying that, although released in 1989, the film's events occurred in the 1970s), has been rehabilitated under the community and now works under a new identity on the check-out counter of a large supermarket.\n\n\nThe film was originally conceived as part of a television series, and only belatedly became a feature after Japanese investors proposed expanding it; as such, the script was hastily re-written. The dialogue was recorded before shooting began. Made on an extremely low budget considering the time-consuming process of working with puppets, the film went over budget and schedule. Some scenes, including the Vietnam flashback, were funded by members of the film crew, and filmed secretly under the title \"The Frogs of War\". The Vietnam flashback includes a game of Russian roulette as a parody of \"The Deer Hunter\". An initial application for Film Commission money was rejected by executive director Jim Booth, who a short time later became Jackson's producer. The Commission eventually granted the production two-thirds of its $750,000 budget, though relationships between the funders and the production soured and the Film Commission removed its credit from the film. It is often mistakenly stated that there are no human characters in the film; the character Abi is a human. However, there are no \"real-life\" human characters in the film. Director Jackson has a cameo as an audience member dressed as an alien from \"Bad Taste\". Every vehicle seen in the film is a variation on the Morris Minor, including a specially constructed limousine. Morris Minors also appear in Jackson's \"Bad Taste\" and \"Braindead\". By presumed coincidence, one of the characters, Harry the Hare, shares a name with the title character of James B. Hemesath's short story \"Harry the Hare\" (himself a Bugs Bunny pastiche), written for Harlan Ellison's anthology \"Again, Dangerous Visions\" in 1972.\n\nThe film's music was composed by Peter Dasent. The soundtrack was released in 1991 by Q.D.K. Media.\n\nThe film was marketed in some countries with the tagline: \"From the creators of \"Bad Taste\", comes a film with no taste at all!\"\n\n\"Meet the Feebles\" was given its public premiere at a fantasy film festival in Hamburg, in April 1990.\n\nFrom then on, the film was released theatrically in Japan (7 December 1990); Portugal (February 1991); Australia (March 1991); Sweden (April 1991); Germany (May 1991); France (July 1991); United Kingdom (April 1992); and the United States (February 1995 in New York and September 1995 nationwide).\n\nThe film was met with generally positive reviews, and holds a 71% \"Fresh\" rating on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 reviews. The site's consensus reads \"Dark and vulgar, \"Meet the Feebles\" is a backstage comedy featuring puppets that offers proof of Peter Jackson's taste for sheer outrageousness, even if it often lapses into pure juvenilia.\"\n\nDuring a limited theatrical release in North America in 2002, critic James Berardinelli touched on aspects of the film which likely helped ensure it limited release in cinemas. \"The stories of these ... characters are told in a disgustingly graphic, obscenely offbeat, and caustically funny manner. \"Meet the Feebles\" is for those with a strong stomach and a seriously warped sense of humor. The film is so off the beaten track that it makes Monty Python seem mainstream.\"\n\n\n"}

Danny Coogan (Levi Fiehler) is making wooden chairs for a wedding reception for his Uncle Len, who owns the Inn. Danny tells his uncle that if it was not for his limp, he would be able to go to war, along with his brother Don, and tells his Uncle that he's going to help André Toulon. Toulon is guest at the inn, whose wife was killed by the Nazis because they wanted a formula, a formula that allows his puppets to come alive. After escaping from Berlin to Geneva, Toulon came to America to hide from the Nazis. As Danny's heading over to Toulon's room, he hears a gunshot and goes to see what happened. Two men dressed in black leaving Toulon's room push Danny aside, and as they leave, he manages to get a glimpse at one of their faces. He enters the room and finds Toulon dead with a gun in his hand. Danny, to whom Toulon showed his puppets, grabs them out of a wall panel and finds that all the puppets are still there, along with unanimated Six Shooter and another puppet, named Ninja.\n\nThe next day, Danny goes to visit his mother, Elma and his brother Don. Don is being shipped off to war the following week. Meanwhile, the two Nazi assassins, Klaus and Max, are heading to an Opera House in Chinatown, under orders from \"The Führer\", where they meet a Japanese saboteur named Ozu (Ada Zhou Fang). She tells them that she's under orders from \"The Emperor\", which are for her and the Nazis to work together to take out an American bomb manufacturing plant, destroying America's war efforts. To obtain this goal, it requires Max to go undercover and pretend to be of American descent and work at the plant, and to get close to the girl who runs the plant's office, Beth (Jenna Gallagher), who is coincidentally Danny's girlfriend. The next day, after bringing the puppets to life, Danny walks into the plant to show them to Beth, and sees Max there. Recognizing him as one of the assassins, he tries to warn Beth away from him, but she doesn't believe him.\n\nAfter Max leaves the plant, Danny follows him back to the Opera House, and uncovers their plan. Danny is seen by Max, and quickly leaves. Max calls the Bodega Bay Inn to find out where he lives and sends Klaus to Danny's mother's place where Elma and Beth are planning a bon voyage party for Don. Klaus shoots Elma, and kidnaps Beth, and also shoots Don when he unexpectedly comes home. Danny comes home to find Don bleeding to death, and after telling him what happened, thanks to Toulon's diary, puts his brother's soul into Ninja's body. Danny and the puppets head out to the opera house to get Beth. Tunneler and Leech Woman kill Ozu's men and Ninja and Pinhead kill Klaus. Danny saves Beth, but Ozu badly hurts Ninja, so Danny and Blade threaten Ozu with the active bomb to back off, which is taken by Max, and supposedly disables it. Ninja, with what little left of life he has, stabs Ozu's sword into back killing him. Ozu takes off with Tunneler and supposedly Jester and Leech Woman inside the bag, leaving behind Blade, Pinhead, and the mortally wounded Ninja. Danny swears that Ozu has a war coming to her.\n\n\nIn late 2009, a teaser trailer was released.\n\n\"Puppet Master: Axis of Evil\" was released on July 27, 2010. Upon its release, Full Moon also released \"Puppet Master: Axis of Evil\" in a collector's set with the original \"Puppet Master\" in its original widescreen format on June 15. The set includes packaging resembling Toulon's trunk, a poster for \"Axis of Evil\", mini-poster cards for all of the films in the series, and stickers featuring each puppet. The set is available on DVD and Blu-ray, marking Full Moon's first foray into the Blu-ray market, including both the original \"Puppet Master\" and \"Axis of Evil\".\n"}

The film tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Al Pacino) who arrives in 1980s Miami with nothing and rises to become a powerful drug kingpin. The cast also features Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, F. Murray Abraham and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.\n\n\"Scarface\" was released on December 9, 1983 and was a box office success, grossing $44 million. Initial critical reception was negative, with criticism over excessive violence and profanity and graphic drug usage. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers.\n\nIn the years that followed, the film has received reappraisal from critics, considered by some to be one of the best films in the crime genre. Screenwriters and directors such as Martin Scorsese have praised the film, which has been referenced extensively in pop culture, especially in rap and hip hop music as well as comic books, TV and video games. The film has long since become a cult classic.\n\nIn 1980, Cuban refugee and ex-convict Antonio \"Tony\" Montana arrives in Miami, Florida as part of the Mariel boatlift, where he is sent to a refugee camp with his best friends, Manny Ribera, Angel and Chi-Chi. The four are released and given green cards in exchange for murdering a former Cuban general at the request of Miami drug dealer Frank Lopez. They become dishwashers in a diner, to Tony's disgust, proclaiming he is meant for bigger things.\n\nFrank's right-hand man, Omar Suarez, gives them a job: purchase cocaine from Colombian dealers, but the deal goes bad. Angel is dismembered with a chainsaw, while Manny and Chi-Chi rescue Tony and kill the Colombians. Suspecting that Omar set them up, Tony and Manny insist on personally delivering the recovered drugs and money to Frank. During their meeting, Tony is attracted to Frank's trophy wife, Elvira Hancock. Frank hires and befriends Tony and Manny.\n\nMonths later, Tony is reunited with his mother Georgina and younger sister Gina, of whom he is fiercely protective. Disgusted by his life of crime, Georgina throws Tony out. Manny is attracted to Gina, but Tony tells him to stay away from her.\n\nFrank sends Tony and Omar to Cochabamba to meet with cocaine kingpin Alejandro Sosa. Tony negotiates a deal without Frank's approval, angering Omar, who leaves to contact Frank. Sosa claims that Omar is a police informant and that Frank is weak; Tony witnesses a beaten Omar hanged from a helicopter. Tony vouches for Frank's organization and Sosa, taking a liking to Tony, agrees to the deal, but not before warning Tony to never betray him.\n\nBack in Miami, Frank is infuriated by Omar's demise and the unauthorized deal struck by Tony. At a nightclub, corrupt detective Mel Bernstein attempts to extort money from Tony in return for police protection and information. Tony angers Frank further by openly pursuing Elvira in the club. Spotting Gina with her boyfriend, Tony angrily beats the two of them. Hitmen attempt to assassinate Tony, but he escapes. Tony, certain that his boss sent both Bernstein and the assassins, confronts Frank, with Manny and Chi-Chi in tow. At gunpoint, Frank confesses to the attempted hit and begs for his life, but he and Bernstein are killed.\n\nTony marries Elvira and becomes the distributor of Sosa's product. He builds a multimillion-dollar empire, living in a vast, heavily guarded estate. By 1983, however, Tony becomes dissatisfied with his lifestyle and cocaine addiction. His money launderer demands a greater percentage, while Manny resents Tony's growing paranoia and abusive treatment of Elvira. A sting by Federal agents results in Tony being charged with tax evasion, with an inevitable prison sentence. Sosa offers to use his government connections to keep a desperate Tony out of prison, but only if Tony assassinates a journalist intending to expose Sosa. Later, Tony, during a public dinner, accuses Manny of causing his arrest and Elvira of being an infertile junkie, causing Elvira to leave him. He travels to New York City to carry out the assassination with Sosa's henchman, Alberto, who plants a radio-controlled bomb under the journalist's car. However, the journalist is unexpectedly accompanied by his wife and children. Disgusted, Tony kills Alberto before he can detonate the bomb and returns to Miami.\n\nAn enraged Sosa calls Tony to promise retribution. Tony, at his mother's behest, tracks down Gina. Tony finds Manny with Gina; in a fit of rage, Tony kills Manny, after which Gina tearfully tells Tony that she and Manny had just gotten married the day before and wanted to surprise him. A stunned Tony returns to his mansion, bringing Gina along, and begins a massive cocaine binge by himself in his office. While Sosa's men begin attacking the mansion, a drugged Gina appears and accuses Tony of wanting her for himself and attempts to kill him, but is slain by one of Sosa's men, who is in turn killed by Tony. With Tony's men all dead and assassins outside, Tony turns a grenade launcher-equipped M16A1 on Sosa's men, mowing down many. Tony is repeatedly shot by the remaining attackers, but continues to taunt them until he is fatally shot from behind by the shotgun-wielding assassin known as The Skull. His limp body falls into a fountain below, in front of a statue reading \"The World is Yours\".\n\n\nRichard Belzer portrays the Babylon Club M.C. De Palma regulars Charles Durning and Dennis Franz provided uncredited voiceover dubbing of the Immigration and Naturalization Service officers who interrogate Montana in the opening scene. Lana Clarkson appears as Manny's dance partner at the Babylon Club.\n\n\"Scarface\" began development after Al Pacino saw the 1932 film of the same name at the Tiffany Theater while in Los Angeles. He later called his manager, producer Martin Bregman, and informed him of his belief in the potential for a remake of that film. Pacino originally wanted to retain the period piece aspect, but realized that because of its melodramatic nature it would be difficult to accomplish. Sidney Lumet became attached as the director, developing the idea for Montana to be Cuban arriving in America during the Mariel boatlift.\n\nBregman and Lumet's creative differences saw Lumet drop out of the project. Lumet had wanted to make a more political story that focused on blaming the current Presidential administration for the influx of cocaine into the United States, and Bregman disagreed with Lumet's views. Bregman replaced him with Brian De Palma, and hired writer Oliver Stone, later stating that it took only four phone calls to secure their involvement. Stone had seen the original 1932 \"Scarface\" and didn't enjoy the film so he initially rejected the offer. Only after he talked to Lumet was he convinced to accept the offer since they agreed on transforming the film from a period piece to a contemporary film, saying, \"Sidney had a great idea to take the 1930's American prohibition gangster movie and make it into a modern immigrant gangster movie dealing with the same problems that we had then, that we're prohibiting drugs instead of alcohol. There's a prohibition against drugs that's created the same criminal class as (prohibition of alcohol) created the Mafia.\" Stone researched the script while battling his own cocaine addiction. He and Bregman performed their own research, travelling to Miami, Florida where they were given access to records from the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Organized Crime Bureau. Stone moved to Paris to write the script, believing he could not break his addiction while in the United States, stating in a 2003 interview that he was completely off drugs at the time \"because I don't think cocaine helps writing. It's very destructive to the brain cells.\"\n\nPacino insisted on taking the lead role as Tony Montana, although Robert De Niro had been offered it and had turned it down. Pacino worked with experts in knife combat, trainers, and boxer Roberto Duran to attain the body type that he wanted for the role. Duran also helped inspire the character, who had \"a certain lion in him\", according to Pacino. Meryl Streep's immigrant character in \"Sophie's Choice\" (1982) also influenced Pacino's portrayal of Tony Montana. Bauer and a dialect coach helped him learn aspects of the Cuban Spanish language and pronunciation.\n\nPfeiffer was an unknown actress at the time, and both Pacino and De Palma had argued against her casting, but Bregman fought for her inclusion. Glenn Close was the original choice for the role, while others were also considered, including Geena Davis, Carrie Fisher, Kelly McGillis, Sharon Stone, and Sigourney Weaver.\n\nBauer got his role without even auditioning. During the audition process, casting director Alixe Gordin saw Bauer and instantly noted that he was right for the role of Manny, a judgment with which both De Palma and Bregman agreed. He was the only actual Cuban in the principal cast. John Travolta was considered for the role.\n\nPacino was injured during rehearsals for a gunfight after he grabbed the barrel of a prop gun which had just been used to fire several dummy bullets. His hand stuck to the hot barrel and he was unable to remove it immediately; the injury sidelined him for two weeks. The gunfight scene also includes a single camera shot directed by Steven Spielberg, who was visiting the set at the time. During filming, some Cuban-Americans objected to the film's Cuban-American characters being portrayed as criminals by non-Cuban-American actors. To counter this, the film features a disclaimer during its credits stating that the film characters were not representative of the Cuban-American community. The entertainment industry initially hated the film, with actress Liza Minnelli asking Pacino what he had done to leave the insiders subdued at a post-screening meal. (Minnelli had not seen the film at the time.) However, during the meal, actor Eddie Murphy told Pacino that he loved the film.\n\nDespite its Miami setting, much of the film was actually shot in Louisville and Los Angeles, as the Miami Tourist board was afraid that the film would deter tourism with its depiction of the state as a haven for drugs and gangsters. Tony's opulent Miami mansion was portrayed by El Fureidis, a Roman-styled mansion in Santa Barbara, California.\n\nThe picture was shot for 24 weeks from November 22, 1982 to May 6, 1983.\n\nThe special effects were performed by Ken Pepiot and Stan Parks.\n\n\"Scarface\" was given an X rating in North America three times for extreme violence, frequent strong language, and hard drug usage. The restrictive rating was more associated with pornography at the time, and it both limited the number of cinemas willing to screen such a film and restricted promotional advertising, which would potentially adversely affect any box office takings. An early scene was singled out as the cause of the X rating, where Montana's associate Angel is dismembered with a chainsaw off screen. De Palma made edits to the scene and resubmitted it to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), but was again given an X rating. He made further edits and resubmitted it from three to five times before refusing to further edit the film, telling Universal to either release it in its current form or fire and replace him with someone who would edit it. Universal opted to appeal the MPAA's decision. Studio president Robert Rehme attended the hearing which was presided over by his friend MPAA President Jack Valenti. Among those speaking on behalf of the film during the appeal were film critic Roger Ebert, the head of Florida's Broward County organized crime division, and the head of a major theater chain named Alan Friedberg. MPAA member Richard Heffner later admitted that he could have fought harder to retain the X rating, but he believed that Valenti did not support the decision, as he did not want to alienate the big film studios. The decision was overwhelmingly in favor of releasing the film with a less restrictive R rating.\n\nIn response, De Palma argued that, if the latest version of the film was now considered an R, then his original version would also be rated R, rationalizing that the edits which he made were minor. The MPAA told De Palma that only his latest edit would be certified as an R. De Palma believed that the changes were so slight that no one would notice if he released his original version anyway, which he ultimately did.\n\n\"Scarface\" premiered on December 1, 1983 in New York City, where it was initially greeted with mixed reaction. The film's two stars, Al Pacino and Steven Bauer, were joined in attendance by Burt and Diane Lane, Melanie Griffith, Raquel Welch, Joan Collins, her boyfriend Peter Holm, and Eddie Murphy, among others. The limited, 20th anniversary theatrical re-release in 2003 boasted a remastered soundtrack with enhanced sound effects and music.\n\nThe initial release of \"Scarface\" was met with a negative critical response, and drew controversy regarding the violence and graphic language in the film. \"The New York Magazine\" defined it as an empty, bullying, and overblown B movie.\n\nIt has been reported that Cher loved the film; Lucille Ball saw the film with her family and hated it because of its strong language and graphic violence; and Dustin Hoffman was said to have fallen asleep. Writers Kurt Vonnegut and John Irving were among those who allegedly walked out in disgust after the notorious chainsaw scene.\nAt the middle of the film, Scorsese turned to Bauer and told him, \"You guys are great – but be prepared, because they're going to hate it in Hollywood... because it's about them.\"\n\nRoger Ebert rated it four stars out of four in his 1983 review, and he later added it to his \"Great Movies\" list. Ebert wrote, \"DePalma and his writer, Oliver Stone, have created a gallery of specific individuals, and one of the fascinations of the movie is that we aren't watching crime-movie clichés, we're watching people who are criminals.\" Vincent Canby praised the film in \"The New York Times\": \"The dominant mood of the film is... bleak and futile: what goes up must always come down. When it comes down in \"Scarface,\" the crash is as terrifying as it is vivid and arresting.\"\n\nLeonard Maltin was among those critics who held a negative opinion of \"Scarface\". He gave the film 1½ stars out of four, stating that \"Scarface\" \"wallows in excess and unpleasantness for nearly \"three hours\", and offers no new insights except that crime doesn't pay. At least the 1932 movie \"moved\".\" Maltin included an addendum to his review in later editions of his annual movie guide, stating his surprise with the film's newfound popularity as a cult-classic.\n\nIn his review for \"Newsweek\", David Ansen wrote, \"If \"Scarface\" makes you shudder, it's from what you \"think\" you see and from the accumulated tension of this feral landscape. It's a grand, shallow, decadent entertainment, which like all good Hollywood gangster movies delivers the punch and counterpunch of glamour and disgust\". Jay Scott writes in his review for \"The Globe and Mail\", \"For a while, Al Pacino is hypnotic as Montana. But the effort expended on the flawless Cuban accent and the attempts to flesh out a character cut from inch-thick cardboard are hopeless.\" In his review for \"The Washington Post\", Gary Arnold wrote, \"A movie that appeared intent on revealing an alarmingly contemporary criminal subculture gradually reverts to underworld cliche, covering its derivative tracks with outrageous decor and an apocalyptic, production number finale, ingeniously choreographed to leave the antihero floating face down in a literal bloodbath.\"\n\nThe review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes offers a contemporary interpretation of the film's reception, providing an 82% approval rating from 67 critics – an average rating of 7.4/10 – with the following consensus: \"Director Brian De Palma and star Al Pacino take it to the limit in this stylized, ultra-violent and eminently quotable gangster epic that walks a thin white line between moral drama and celebratory excess.\" Metacritic gives it an average score of 65/100.\n\n\"Scarface\" was released theatrically in North America on December 9, 1983. The film earned $4.5 million from 996 theaters during its opening weekend, an average of $4,616 per theater, and ranking as the second-highest-grossing film of the weekend behind \"Sudden Impact\" ($9.6 million), which debuted the same weekend. It went on to earn $45.4 million in North America and $20.4 million from other markets, for a total of $65.8 million. This figure made \"Scarface\" the 16th highest-grossing film of 1983, and seventh highest grossing R-rated film in North America for 1983.\n\n\"Scarface\" was initially released by MCA Home Video on VHS, CED Videodisc, Laserdisc, and Beta in the summer of 1984 – a two-tape set in 1.33:1 pan and scan ratio – and quickly became a bestseller, preluding its cult status. A 2.35:1 Widescreen VHS would follow years later in 1998 to coincide with the special edition DVD release. The last VHS release was in 2003 to counterpart the 20th anniversary edition DVD.\n\nThe television version of \"Scarface\" premiered on ABC on January 7, 1989. 32 minutes of violence, profanity and sex were edited out, and much of the dialogue, including the constant use of the word \"fuck\", which was muted after the beginning of \"f-\" or replaced with less offensive alternatives.\n\nThe film received a North American DVD release on the film's fifteenth anniversary in 1998 featuring a non-anamorphic widescreen transfer, a \"Making of\" documentary, outtakes, production notes, and cast and crew biographies. This release was not successful, and many fans and reviewers complained about its unwatchable video transfer and muddled sound, describing it as \"one of the worst big studio releases out there\". In 2003, a 20th anniversary re-release, featured two documentaries — including a new interview with Steven Bauer and another produced by Def Jam Recordings featuring interviews with various rappers on the film's cult status in the hip hop world.\n\n\"Scarface\" was released on Blu-ray Disc on September 6, 2011 in a two-disc, limited edition, steelbox package. The set contains a remastered, 1080p widescreen transfer of the film in 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround sound, as well as a digital copy. Disc two is a DVD of the 1932 \"Scarface\", featuring a TMC-produced introduction by Robert Osborne and an alternate ending. Bonus features include \"The Making of Scarface\" documentary, and a new retrospective documentary: \"The Scarface Phenomenon\".\n\nA special gift set, limited to 1,000 copies, features the Blu-ray set housed in a cigar humidor, designed by humidor craftsman Daniel Marshall. The humidor box set retailed at $999.99.\n\nUniversal also launched a \"National Fan Art Contest\" via Facebook. The top 25 submissions selected by Universal were entered in a poll where fans voted on their 10 favorite works to be featured as art cards in the Blu-ray set. The Grand-Prize winner had their artwork featured on a billboard in a major US city in order to promote the release. To celebrate the release of \"Scarface\" on Blu-ray, Universal Studios and Fathom Events teamed up to make a \"Scarface\" Special Event. The event included \"Scarface\" coming back to select theaters nationwide for one night only on Wednesday, August 31, 2011. A twenty-minute documentary on how the film impacted the world today also featured.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nInstead of using music from the period in which the film was set, the generic music in \"Scarface\" was produced by Academy Award-winning Italian record producer Giorgio Moroder. Reflecting Moroder's style, the soundtrack consists mostly of muzak-like synthesized new wave, electronic music. De Palma says that he has repeatedly denied Universal's requests to release the film with a \"pop\" score because he feels that Moroder's score is adequate.\n\nPacino was already an established successful actor, but \"Scarface\" helped launch Pfeiffer's and Mastrantonio's careers, both of whom were relatively unknown beforehand, and both went on to individual successes. \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked the film #8 on their list of \"The Top 50 Cult Films,\" and Empire Magazine placed it among the top 500 films of all time, at #284. In 2010, VH1 rated the movie at number 5 in its list of 100 greatest movies of all time. In 2009, \"Total Film\" listed it at number 9 on their list of the 30 Greatest Gangster movies. \"Scarface\" was among the earliest films in which the expletive \"fuck\" is used persistently, 226 times in total. The company set up by former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to launder money was named Montana Management after Pacino's character.\n\nThe release of \"Scarface\" coincided with the rise of hip hop music, and the film has had a lasting influence on hip hop artists. American rapper Nas compared himself to Tony Montana and compared rapper Jay-Z to Manolo, both characters from \"Scarface\", on Nas' track \"Last Real Nigga Alive\" from his album \"God's Son\", during the time of the high-profile feud between the two.\n\nIn 2010, artist James Georgopoulos included the screen-used guns from Scarface in his popular \"Guns of Cinema\" series. Dark Horse Comics' imprint DH Press released a novel called \"Scarface: The Beginning\" by L. A. Banks. IDW publishing released a limited series called \"Scarface: Scarred For Life\". It starts with corrupt police officers finding that Tony has survived the final mansion showdown. Tony works at rebuilding his criminal empire, similar to the game \"The World Is Yours\".\n\nAmong other films, \"Scarface\" served as a major inspiration for the 2002 video game \"\", which took place in a representation of 1980s' Miami and featured music from the film's soundtrack, as well as a recreation of Montana's mansion. \"Scarface\" got its own direct tie-in with the 2006 video games \"\" and \"\".\n\nThe quote \"Say hello to my little friend!\" from the film's climactic scene has become a pop culture staple, and ranked 61 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes list.\n\nWWE Hall of Famer Scott Hall described the characters Tony Montana and Manny Ribera were an inspiration for his gimmick Razor Ramon. Ramon's nickname (The Bad Guy) and catchphrase (\"Say hello to The Bad Guy\") derive from Montana's quotes: \"Say hello to my little friend\" and \"Say goodnight to the bad guy\".\n\nIn 2016, South Korean rapper Agust D released a mixtape with one of the tracks titled \"Tony Montana\" after Pacino's character.\n\nIn 2001, plans were made for hip hop artist Cuban Link to write and star in a sequel to \"Scarface\" titled \"Son of Tony\". The plans drew both praise and criticism and, after several years, Cuban Link indicated that he may no longer be involved with the project as the result of movie rights issues and creative control.\n\nUniversal announced in 2011 that the studio is developing a new version of \"Scarface\". The studio stated that the new film is neither a sequel nor a remake, but will take elements from both this version and its 1932 predecessor, including the basic premise: a man who becomes a kingpin in his quest for the American Dream. Martin Bregman produced the 1983 remake and would produce this version also, with a screenplay by David Ayer, and David Yates in talks to direct the film.\n\nOn March 24, 2014, \"TheWrap\" reported that Pablo Larraín was in negotiations to direct the film, along with Paul Attanasio writing the film's script. The film's update will be an original story set in modern-day Los Angeles that follows a Mexican immigrant's rise in the criminal underworld as he strives for the American Dream. Jonathan Herman was set in March 2015 to rewrite both drafts of the script.\n\nOn August 10, 2016, Deadline Hollywood reported that Antoine Fuqua was in talks to direct the film. On September 28, 2016, \"Variety\" reported that Terence Winter would be penning the script for the film. In January 2017, Fuqua left the project and Diego Luna was cast in the lead role. On February 10, 2017, it was announced that the film would be released in theaters on August 10, 2018, with the film's script being written by the Coen brothers.\n\nOn March 30, 2018, it was announced that Fuqua will direct the new film with Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer writing the screenplay.\n\nOn August 9, 2018, the film had not been released in theaters as originally planned and filming had been announced to start in October 2018. Filming would take place in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Mexico.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21634758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21634758", "title": "Slum tourism", "text": "Slum tourism\n\nSlum tourism, or ghetto tourism is a type of tourism that involves visiting impoverished areas. Originally focused on the slums of London and Manhattan in the 19th century, slum tourism is now becoming increasingly prominent in many places, including South Africa, India, Brazil, Poland, Kenya, Philippines, United States, and others.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" dates the first use of the word slumming to 1884. In London, people visited slum neighborhoods such as Whitechapel or Shoreditch in order to observe life in this situation. By 1884 wealthier people in New York City began to visit the Bowery and the Five Points area of the Lower East Side, neighborhoods of poor immigrants, to see \"how the other half lives\".\n\nIn the 1980s in South Africa, black residents organized township tours to educate the whites in local governments on how the black population lived. Such tours attracted international tourists, who wanted to learn more about apartheid.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, international tours began to be organized with destinations in the most disadvantaged areas of developing nations, often known as slums. They have grown in popularity, and are often run and advertised by professional companies. In Cape Town, for example, upwards of 300,000 tourists visit the city each year to view the slums.\n\nPrior to the release of \"Slumdog Millionaire\" in 2008, Mumbai was a slum tourist destination.\nThe concept of slum tourism has recently started to gain more attention from media and academia alike. In December 2010 the first international conference on slum tourism was held in Bristol. A social network of people working in or with slum tourism has been set up.\n\nSlum tourism is mainly performed in urban areas of developing countries, most often named after the type of areas that are visited:\n\nGhetto tourism focuses on slums known as ghettoes, especially in developed countries. Ghetto tourism was first studied in 2005 by Michael Stephens in the cultural-criticism journal, \"PopMatters\". Ghetto tourism includes all forms of entertainment — gangsta rap, video games, movies, TV, and other forms that allow consumers to traffic in the inner city without leaving home. As Stevens says, \"digital media achieves more detailed simulations of reality. The quest for thrills mutates into a desire, not just to see bigger and better explosions, but to cross class and racial boundaries and experience other lifestyles.\" International tourists to New York City in the 1980s led to a successful tourism boom in Harlem. By 2002, Philadelphia began offering tours of blighted inner-city neighborhoods. After Hurricane Katrina, tours were offered in flood-ravaged Lower Ninth Ward, a notoriously violent and poor section of New Orleans. \n\nGhetto or \"urban tourism\" often encompasses travel to destinations made famous by direct or indirect mention by popular artists. Travel to certain parts of Detroit that include 8 Mile Road, known for the role the travel route played in the similarly titled \"8 Mile\" film starring Eminem, or to Crenshaw Boulevard in South Central Los Angeles, a metropolitan area that inspired an entire generation of pioneering musical influence, could potentially be included as urban tourism. The Jane-Finch area of Toronto, Ontario, Canada is gaining notoriety as another area in transition.\n\nCharleroi, in Belgium, is another example of this phenomenon in a developed country.\n\nA 2010 study by the University of Pennsylvania showed that tourists in Mumbai's Dharavi slum were motivated primarily by curiosity, as opposed to several competing push factors such as social comparison, entertainment, education, or self-actualization. In addition, the study found that most slum residents were ambivalent about the tours, while the majority of tourists reported positive feelings during the tour, with interest and intrigue as the most commonly cited \nfeelings. Many tourists often come to the slums to put their life in perspective.\n\nSlum tourism has been the subject of much controversy, with critics labelling the voyeuristic aspects of slum tourism as poverty porn. Both critiques and defenses of the practice have been made in the editorial pages of prominent newspapers, such as the \"New York Times\", \"Wall Street Journal\", London \"Times\", and others. A primary accusation that the advocates against slum tourism make is that it \"turns poverty into entertainment, something that can be momentarily experienced and then escaped from\". Kennedy Odede, a Kenyan, wrote in the \"New York Times\" Op-Ed section, \"They get photos; we lose a piece of our dignity.\" Similar critics call the tours voyeuristic and exploitative. Slum tourism critics have also cited the fact that Christmas and Valentine's Day as common times for slum tourism further supporting the belief that Westerners often visit slums just to \"feel better about themselves\" during those holidays when most people are with families and significant others.\n\nThe tours provide employment and income for tour guides from the slums, an opportunity for craft-workers to sell souvenirs, and may invest back in the community with profit that is earned. Similarly, the argument has been raised that well-off tourists may be more motivated to help as a result.\n\nIn 2013 controversy arose when a company called \"Real Bronx Tours\" was discovered offering tours of The Bronx, North America, advertised as \"a ride through a real New York City 'ghetto'...[the borough] was notorious for drugs, gangs, crime and murders\". Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. and councilwoman Melissa Mark-Viverito condemned the tours stating \"Using the Bronx to sell a so-called 'ghetto' experience to tourists is completely unacceptable and the highest insult to the communities we represent.\" The tours were soon discontinued.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46732184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46732184", "title": "Sports Federation of India", "text": "Sports Federation of India\n\nThe Sports Federation of India (SFI) is an autonomous entity registered under Trust Act 1950 (INDIA), aspiring to promote professionalism in sports and establishment of quality standards in educational organizations preferably in rural and semi-urban regions of India.\n\nThe objectives for which the Trust is founded are:\n\n\nIn tandem with the prime objective of defining sports as a viable career option, the Federation started establishing sports academies. In the meantime, it was realized that the timing of formal schools and coaching classes incorporated with the lack of resources are the major stumbling blocks. It is to this context in reaching the desirous goal of promoting professional sports amongst children. Considering the assessed scenario, a social model of development for sustainable growth is being proposed (model- 1) by the federation. SFI is ready to take a lead through opening Schools and thus imparting quality standards and professional sports training thereon. So far, three schools and one sports academy in rural India have already been set up and the training of around 1000 student is been done. Considering the socio-economic profile of targeted populace the facilities are kept almost free, in turn causing severe fund crisis to run the existing institutions and replicating a new one.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federation anyhow manages the affiliates so far by organizing different events related to adventure sporting, professional sporting, events of cultural significance as well as voluntary contributions. The federation has successfully established organizations i.e. Schools and sports academies, but in respect of the level of demand it is just a start and there is much potential envisage to take it to the larger scale. It is to this context to benefit those incumbents who are far behind in approaching such facilities. Otherwise they would be denied of making their dream come true. \nConsidering the demand for affordable schools and sports facilities in rural and semi-urban areas where there is limited access to quality education and sports opportunities. It is ensured that the students in these institutions get sufficient opportunity to assess their talents and pursue them. Sports academies are run in conjunction with schools for professional training right from the very beginning. Apart from sports and education, developing other talents in the students is also among the concerns of the organization. Training and education of around 1000 student is being done in the institutions developed so far. \nBasis on above mentioned scenario following are the major concern emerges for the organization\n\nTo maintain and run a sustainable development scheme or project, quality checks and assessments are found to be mandatory. Sustainability is solely dependent on the quality of output a system provides. Quality of education and training provided in the institutions run under or in association with the trust is vital, and has become the prime concern of the organization to achieve its goals.\n\nSpots have been a successful career for many, but still there is a negative general perception of sports being a career. This may be because of lack of professional sports training in rural and under developed areas. Census 2011 has documented that the total population that lives in rural India, is 83.3 cr. that is 70% of the total Indian population. Further there are regions in urban India that has not yet been developed to its full extent and are termed semi urban regions. These underdeveloped regions do also host a large population. Such a vast scope of opportunity placed professional sports training amongst the prime concerns of the trust undisputedly.\n\nExpansion of the objectives of trust solely depends upon the procurement of fund. The trust anyhow managed the pilot projects by different means. For expansion and maximization of the reach of federation fund raising has proved to be a big challenge.\n\nIn pursuit of achieving its goals the federation found that sport trainers and educators often work individually and could not utilize their full potential. Due to lack of awareness regarding available opportunities and procedures many talents can’t find their way to success. This analysis gave way to the need of building support base network to help trainers, educators and trainees to move out to new places. This is to use the skills of trainers and educators to train potential talents on one hand and showcase the polished talents on the other.\n"}

{"id": "32330027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32330027", "title": "The Lone Ranger (2013 film)", "text": "The Lone Ranger (2013 film)\n\nThe Lone Ranger is a 2013 American western action film directed by Gore Verbinski and written by Justin Haythe, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. Based on the radio series of the same name, the film stars Johnny Depp as Tonto, the narrator of the events and Armie Hammer as John Reid, the Lone Ranger. The film is told through Tonto's memories of the duo's earliest efforts to subdue local villainy and bring justice to the American Old West. William Fichtner, Barry Pepper, Ruth Wilson, James Badge Dale, Tom Wilkinson and Helena Bonham Carter also are featured in supporting roles. It is the first theatrical film featuring the Lone Ranger and Tonto characters in the more than 32 years following William A. Fraker's 1981 film, \"The Legend of the Lone Ranger\".\n\nProduced by Walt Disney Pictures, Jerry Bruckheimer Films and Depp's Infinitum Nihil, filming was plagued with production problems and budgetary concerns which at one point led to the film's premature cancellation. The film was released theatrically in the United States on July 3, 2013 and was a box office bomb, grossing only $260.5 million worldwide against an estimated $225–250 million production budget and an additional $150 million in marketing costs. The film received two Academy Award nominations for Best Visual Effects and Best Makeup and Hairstyling.\n\nIn 1933, a boy named Will who idolizes the legendary Lone Ranger encounters the elderly Comanche Tonto in a sideshow at a San Francisco fair. Tonto proceeds to recount his experiences with that Old West adventurer.\n\nIn 1869, lawyer John Reid returns home to Colby, Texas, via the uncompleted Transcontinental Railroad, managed by railroad tycoon Latham Cole. Unknown to Reid, the train is also carrying Tonto and outlaw Butch Cavendish, who is being transported for his hanging after being captured by Dan Reid, John's Texas Ranger brother. Cavendish's gang rescues Butch and derails the train. Tonto is subsequently jailed. Dan deputizes John as a Texas Ranger, and with six others they go after the Cavendish gang.\n\nCavendish's men ambush and kill their pursuers. Cavendish slays Dan with his dagger and devours his heart as revenge for his imprisonment. Tonto, who has escaped from jail, comes across the dead men and buries them. However, a white spirit horse awakens John as a \"spirit walker\", and Tonto explains John cannot be killed in battle. Tonto also tells him Collins, one of the Rangers, betrayed Dan and is working with Cavendish. As John is thought to be dead, he wears a mask to protect his identity from enemies. Tonto gives John a silver bullet made from the fallen Rangers' badges and tells him to use it on Cavendish, whom he believes to be a mystical beast called a wendigo.\n\nAt a brothel Collins recently visited, Red Harrington informs the two about Dan and Collins' fight over a cursed silver rock. Meanwhile, Cavendish's men, disguised as Comanches, raid frontier settlements. John and Tonto arrive after raiders abduct Dan's widow and son, Rebecca and Danny. Regretting his earlier actions, Collins attempts to help the mother and child escape, but is shot dead by Cole, who rescues them. Claiming the raiders are hostile Comanches, Cole announces the continued construction of the railroad and dispatches US Cavalry Captain Jay Fuller to wipe out the Comanches.\n\nA Comanche tribe captures John and Tonto after the pair finds railroad tracks in Native territory. The leader tells John of Tonto's past: As a boy, Tonto had rescued Cavendish and another man from near-death and later showed them a mountain full of silver ore in exchange for a pocket watch. The men murdered the tribe to keep the location a secret, leaving Tonto with great guilt which led to him believing the two were wendigos.\n\nTonto and John escape as the cavalry attack the Comanche. At the silver mine, the duo captures Cavendish. Tonto demands John use the silver bullet to kill Cavendish, but John refuses. Upon returning Cavendish to Cole and Fuller's custody, Cole is revealed to be Cavendish's partner and brother. Fuller, fearful of being labeled a war criminal for slaughtering the tribe, sides with Cole. Rebecca is held hostage, and John is returned to the mine to be executed. Tonto rescues him and the two flee. Realizing Cole is too powerful to be taken down lawfully and regretful since his arrogance in ignoring Tonto led to the mass slaughter of the Comanches and the kidnapping of his loved ones, John dons the mask again.\n\nAt Promontory Summit, during the railroad's union ceremony, Cole reveals his true plan: to take control of the railroad company and use the mined silver to gain more power. John and Tonto steal nitroglycerin and use it to destroy a railroad bridge. With Red's help, Tonto steals the train with the silver, and Cole, Cavendish and Fuller pursue him in a second train on which Rebecca and Dan Jr. are being held captive. On horseback, John pursues both trains. After a furious chase and fights on both trains, Cavendish and Fuller are killed, Rebecca and Dan Jr. are rescued, and Cole drowns while being buried beneath the silver ore after the train plunges off the severed bridge and into the river below, killing him.\n\nThe town recognize John as a hero and offers him a law-enforcement position. John declines, and he and Tonto ride off. Back in 1933, Will questions the truth of the story. Tonto gives him a silver bullet and tells him to decide for himself, and then departs.\n\n\nIn March 2002, Columbia Pictures announced their intention to make a \"Lone Ranger\" film with Classic Media, who owned the film rights at the time. Husband and wife producers Douglas Wick and Lucy Fisher joined the project. The tone was to be similar to \"The Mask of Zorro\", and Columbia suggested that Tonto be re-written as a female love interest. The projected budget was set at $70 million. David and Janet Peoples were hired to write the script the following year, which was rewritten by Laeta Kalogridis. Jonathan Mostow was attached to direct by early 2005, but Columbia placed the film in turnaround. The Weinstein Company was interested in purchasing the film rights from Classic Media in 2007 but the deal fell apart when Entertainment Rights eventually optioned the property. They teamed with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and brought \"The Lone Ranger\" to Walt Disney Pictures. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, who worked with Bruckheimer and Disney on the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" film series, were being courted to write the script. In late March 2008, Elliott and Rossio were in final negotiations.\n\nDisney then announced in September 2008 that Johnny Depp would be portraying Tonto while the Elliot-Rossio script was rewritten by Justin Haythe. The Elliot and Rossio script reportedly had a supernatural plot element involving coyotes. In May 2009, Mike Newell, who was then directing \"\" for Bruckheimer and Disney, entered negotiations to direct \"Lone Ranger\". Bruckheimer explained the following June that he wanted to wait before hiring a director, until Newell completed \"Prince of Persia,\" and until Depp finished filming \".\" \"The priority is most definitely \"Pirates 4,\"\" Bruckheimer commented. \"They are going to cast the title role once they get a director and Disney greenlights. We don't have a director yet.\" In September of 2010, Gore Verbinski was hired to direct. Verbinski had suggested giving the role of Tonto to Depp while filming the film. Filming was slated to begin after Depp finished work on \"Dark Shadows\". Actor Armie Hammer was selected to play the Lone Ranger, a role that Bruckheimer described as being written for \"a young Jimmy Stewart character\".\n\nOn August 12, 2011, Disney announced that production on \"The Lone Ranger\" would be delayed due to budget concerns expressed by CEO Bob Iger and then Walt Disney Studios chairman Rich Ross. The studio and production team constrained the film's allocated budget, with Verbinski, Bruckheimer, Depp, and Hammer, equally deferring 20% of their salaries to minimize the overall cost. After addressing the project's production problems in October 2011, Disney confirmed that the film was back on track after the budget was reworked to give the studio a chance to recoup its costs. Initially, filming was reported to begin on February 6, 2012, for a projected release date of May 31, 2013, which subsequently was moved to the Fourth of July weekend of that same year.\n\nAfter Alan F. Horn replaced Rich Ross as chairman of the Walt Disney Studios in 2012, he began working right away on the film, and insisted on trimming most of the scene where Cavendish eats Dan Reid's heart. Horn later explained: \"I like heart in my movies ... but not that much heart.\"\n\nPrincipal photography began on March 8, 2012, and, soon after, the first photograph of Depp as Tonto and Hammer as the Lone Ranger was released. Filming locations extended throughout six states: Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, and California. Some filming occurred specifically near Creede, Colorado, in June 2012; Moab, Utah, in July 2012; and Cimarron Canyon State Park, New Mexico in August. Second unit (stunt and blue screen) work commenced in late September 2012 in the parking lot of Santa Anita Racetrack, Arcadia, California.\n\nThe film was shot in the anamorphic format, with cinematographer Bojan Bazelli using Panavision C- and G-Series lenses. Daytime exteriors—about 70 percent of the film—were shot on Kodak VISION3 50D 5203 35 mm film with Panavision Panaflex Platinum and Arriflex 435 cameras; interiors and nighttime exteriors were shot digitally with Arri Alexa Studio cameras.\n\nThe shoot met with several problems including inclement weather, wildfires, a chickenpox outbreak and the death of crew member Michael Andrew Bridger on September 21, 2012. Bridger, a water safety expert, died while working inside a large water tank. Several cast members had to receive formal training on horseback riding, gunslinging, and lassoing.\n\nIndustrial Light & Magic created the visual effects for \"The Lone Ranger\", including a CGI-rendering of the Golden Gate Bridge as it looked while under construction during 1936 - although the film's opening is set in 1933.\n\nBeginning in November 2013, the Autry National Center exhibited the costumes Hammer and Depp wore in the film through a loan from the Walt Disney Archives.\n\nIn April 2012, it was announced that Jack White was hired to compose the score for the film. White later declined to work on the film's music, citing scheduling conflicts, and he was replaced with Hans Zimmer in December 2012. In March 2013, Michael Einziger tweeted that he was working with Zimmer on the score. The film's soundtrack was issued by Walt Disney Records in two releases: Zimmer's film score and the \"inspired by\" concept album on July 2, 2013.\n\nAs a result of the production setbacks, \"The Lone Ranger\" faced numerous release date changes. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures initially scheduled the film for a mid-2011 release date, but \"\" replaced it because the latter was considered a priority for the studio and that \"The Lone Ranger\" did not have a director. After Gore Verbinski signed for director, \"The Lone Ranger\"'s release date was moved to December 21, 2012. Budget concerns and negotiations resulted in a production delay so the release date was pushed to May 31, 2013. By mid-2012, DreamWorks Pictures' \"Robopocalypse\" was facing its own production delays and could not meet its July 3, 2013 release date and therefore Disney had \"The Lone Ranger\" assume its place for the Fourth of July holiday weekend.\n\nThe first trailer debuted at San Diego Comic-Con before being released theatrically on October 3, 2012. Television promotions for the film aired during Super Bowl XLVII. Disney used the film's production connection to the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" series as the main tagline in the film's marketing, as well as featuring the film's two main characters in promotional materials for \"Disney Infinity\".\n\n\"The Lone Ranger\" was selected as the closing film for the Taormina Film Festival. Its world premiere was held on June 22 at the Hyperion Theater in the Hollywood Land district of Disney California Adventure, with proceeds being donated to the American Indian College Fund.\n\nThe film was remastered and released in IMAX theaters on August 7, 2013 in several international territories including the United Kingdom and Japan.\n\n\"The Lone Ranger\" was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Blu-ray and DVD on December 17, 2013. It was released in Australia on October 31.\n\nThe film grossed $89,302,115 in the United States and $171,200,000 in other countries for a worldwide total of $260,502,115.\n\nPreliminary reports had the film tracking for a $60–$70 million debut in North America. The film earned $2 million from late showings on Tuesday, July 2, 2013 and $9.67 million on its opening day, July 4. During its opening weekend, the film debuted in second place with $29.3 million over three days and $48.9 million over the five-day frame.\n\nAfter under-performing during its opening weekend, the film was characterized by numerous media sources as a box office flop with many observers comparing it unfavorably to \"John Carter\", another big-budgeted Disney film that failed commercially the year before. \"The New York Times\" estimated that the film cost $375 million to produce and market, and would need to earn an estimated $650 million worldwide to break even, after accounting for revenue splits with theater owners. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noted that the losses from the film could surpass $150 million, with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures vice-president Dave Hollis calling these results \"very disappointing\".\n\nCompared to \"Despicable Me 2\", a film that opened the same weekend to $142.1 million on a $76 million budget, \"The Wall Street Journal\" noted that \"The Lone Ranger\" made just under a third of that ($48.9 million) and had more than three times the budget ($215 million). Nearly 68% of ticket buyers were over 25 years old and nearly 25% over 50 years old, a much higher percentage than is typical for the studio. Disney viewed the film's international performance ($24.3 million from 24 markets), including that of Russia and Australia, as \"softer than we would have liked.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" and \"USA Today\" reported that \"The Lone Ranger\" joined a string of high-concept western films that failed at the box office, such as 1999's \"Wild Wild West\", which cost $170 million but grossed $222 million, 2011's \"Cowboys & Aliens\", which cost $160 million but grossed $100 million and 2010's \"Jonah Hex\", which cost $47 million but grossed less than $11 million. Chief analyst for \"Boxoffice\" Phil Contrino described the film's box office performance as \"the kind of bomb that people discuss for years to come\" due to its use of otherwise successful director, producer and stars. Alan Horn, current Walt Disney Studios chairman, admitted the financial risk the studio faced with the film. Jay Rasulo, Disney CFO, expects to attribute a loss of $160–190 million in the company's Studio Entertainment division during the fourth fiscal quarter.\n\nIn September 2014, studio president Alan Bergman was asked at a conference if Disney had been able to partially recoup its losses on \"The Lone Ranger\" and \"John Carter\" through subsequent release windows or other monetization methods, and he responded: \"I'm going to answer that question honestly and tell you no, it didn't get that much better. We did lose that much money on those movies.\"\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 31% based on 229 reviews with an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp make for an appealing pair of leads, but they're not enough to make up for \"The Lone Ranger\"'s bland script, bloated length, and blaring action overkill.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 37 out of 100, based on reviews from 45 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nMick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" gave the film a negative review, calling the film \"a jumbled botch that is so confused in its purpose and so charmless in its effect that it must be seen to be believed, but better yet, no. Don't see it, don't believe it.\" Lou Lumenick of the \"New York Post\" was equally scathing, calling it a \"bloated, misshapen mess, a stillborn franchise loaded with metaphors for its feeble attempts to amuse, excite and entertain.\" Charlie McCollum of the \"San Jose Mercury News\" wrote, \"In the end, \"The Lone Ranger\" is one hot mess—an entertaining one, to be sure, but still a mess.\" Tim Walker of \"The Independent\" gave a mixed review, praising Gore Verbinski for \"employ[ing] the Old West to good effect, with gorgeous widescreen vistas that owe everything to Sergio Leone and John Ford.\" However, he added, \"it takes a full hour for Reid to don his mask, and then there’s another 80 unremarkable minutes to go.\"\n\nAmong some of the positive reviews, James Verniere of the \"Boston Herald\" wrote, \"The film, part spoof, part pastiche, is chockablock with violent incident, spectacular settings, Buster Keaton-esque action and colorful characters out of spaghetti Westerns of yore.\" Andrew O'Hehir of Salon.com called it \"an ambitious and inventive film that’s always trying to tweak formula and play with audience expectations. If anything, it’s overstuffed with imagination and ideas...\" Jon Niccum of the \"Kansas City Star\" stated, \"The movie takes a more old-fashioned approach to thrills. It appears to showcase as many stuntmen as it does digital compositors.\"\n\nAmong British critics, the reception was more positive. Angie Errigo of the British film magazine \"Empire\" gave it four of five stars, finding \"[r]eal storytelling, well thought-out and beautifully, at times insanely, executed, with excitement, laughs and fun to make you feel seven years old again.\" Robbie Collin of \"The Daily Telegraph\" gave the film three stars out of five, writing, \"Verbinski shows more ambition here than he did in \"Pirates of the Caribbean\".\" He added, \"[I]n a sane world this would never have been made, although I’m really rather glad someone did.\" Frank Lovece, writing for \"Film Journal International\", addressed critics' concerns over the film's tone by pointing out, \"[T]he movie is told in flashback from the perspective of a wizened, quite eccentric character—the working definition of the film-school trope 'the unreliable narrator.' ... Whatever really happened out on the frontier, this is the story as Tonto remembers it, animist mysticism and all.\"\n\nGore Verbinski, Jerry Bruckheimer, Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp openly criticized the American critical reception of the film, arguing that the negative coverage surrounding the project was influenced by reports of production troubles, with Bruckheimer accusing critics of \"reviewing the budget,\" instead of the film itself. Hammer added, \"If you go back and read the negative reviews, most of them aren't about the content of the movie, but more what's behind it. They tried to do the same thing to \"World War Z\"; it didn't work, the movie was successful. Instead they decided to slit the jugular of our movie.\"\n\nFilmmaker Quentin Tarantino called the film one of the ten best films of 2013 through October: \"The first forty-five minutes are excellent…the next forty-five minutes are a little soporific. It was a bad idea to split the bad guys in two groups; it takes hours to explain and nobody cares. Then comes the train scene—incredible! When I saw it, I kept thinking, ‘What, that’s the film that everybody says is crap? Seriously?’\"\n\nFilm critic Scout Tafoya included the film in his video series \"The Unloved\" in 2015, likening the film's unfortunate circumstances to what the 1980 Western film \"Heaven's Gate\" similarly went through. Tafoya considers \"The Lone Ranger\" to be a masterpiece, praising the film's deconstruction of American myths which erased the tragedies experienced by Native Americans, stating: \"There's a melancholy that runs through even the most frenetic, kinetic action sequence in \"The Lone Ranger\". No matter how big a grin it puts in your face, it's still about the deaths of thousands, not to mention our ideals, of the stain on our legacy as a united people.\" Film critic Matt Zoller Seitz of \"RogerEbert.com\" gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, stating that \"for all its miscalculations, this is a personal picture, violent and sweet, clever and goofy. It's as obsessive and overbearing as Steven Spielberg's \"1941\" — and, I'll bet, as likely to be re-evaluated twenty years from now, and described as 'misunderstood.'\"\n\nDespite the producers citing the presence of an adviser from the Comanche Nation, some debated the advisability of casting of Depp as a Native American and whether the film would present a positive and accurate representation of the Comanche. Depp has stated he believes he has Native American ancestry, possibly from a great-grandmother. He has said that he considered the role a personal attempt \"to try to right the wrongs of the past\", in reference to portrayals of Native American culture in the media.\n\nTodd McDaniels, a linguist at the Comanche Nation College, commented on Depp's attempts to speak the Comanche language, which has 25 to 30 living native speakers. \"The words were there, the pronunciation was shaky, but adequate.\"\n\n\n"}

He spreads a newspaper on the floor (thus demonstrating that no trap door is hidden there) and places a chair on top of it. He has his assistant sit in the chair, and spreads a blanket over her. When he removes the blanket, she has disappeared. He then waves his arms in the air and conjures up a skeleton. He places the blanket over the skeleton and removes it to reveal his assistant, alive and well.\n\nMéliès himself is the magician in the film; his assistant is Jehanne d'Alcy.\n\nThe film is based on a magic act developed by the French magician Buatier de Kolta. When the illusion was produced onstage, a trapdoor was used to create the appearances and disappearances; for the film, however, Méliès needed no trapdoor, using instead an editing technique called the substitution splice. \"The Vanishing Lady\" marks Méliès's first known use of the effect.\n\n\"The Vanishing Lady\" was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 70 in its catalogues. Though the surviving print of the film is in black-and-white, hand-colored prints of Méliès's films were also sold; the Méliès expert Jacques Malthête reconstructed a hand-colored version of the film in 1979, using authentic materials.\n\n"}

And for a flick with this many characters, remarkably few of them wind up charred corpses.\" Jules Faber from \"DVD.net\" gave the film 7 out of 10 stars, concluding: \"Trapped is perhaps one of this new breed of film with some decent performances and clever, well-executed special effects.

There are many virtual zoos that have been created; most are small and unremarkable, while some have hundreds of exhibits.\n\nMany of these projects focus on photos of animals or the sale of animal products. Some virtual zoos are strictly educational. Zoos on the web are good sources of animal information.\n\nThe first virtual zoo was created in 1994 by Ken Boschert, DVM. Boschert created his site as a way of informing people about animals and how to care for them. His site has been recognized by Education World and \"Web 100\".\n\nThe validity of virtual zoos have met with some resistance. However, many view virtual zoos as the way of the future for conservation. Zoos have faced ethical issues surrounding the capture and keeping of wild animals. Virtual zoos can provide information and experience without any disturbance to habits or ecosystems.

{"id": "54231982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54231982", "title": "Wakayama Marina City", "text": "Wakayama Marina City\n\nWakayama Marina City is a resort town built on an artificial island of 49 hectares (121 acres) in size, in Wakaura Bay, part of the larger Osaka Bay. It is also part of Wakayama-shi (City) Wakayama-ken (Prefecture) on the Kansai Peninsula, about a forty-minute train ride south of the Kansai International Airport, which is itself built on an artificial island. The nearest large city is Osaka, Japan, about an hour by train to the north.\n\nWakayama Marina City is one of ten artificial islands in Wakaura Bay, a feature of the larger Osaka Bay. It was built from fill removed from a nearby mountain, and is disconnected from the coastline, except for two bridges to the mainland. There are also two saltwater canals crossing the island. Construction of the island began in April, 1989. It opened to the public in 1994. Marina City was originally developed by Matsushita Investment and Development Company, Ltd. (MID) and Wakayama Prefecture. It now supports a large marina, run by the Wakayama Marina City Yacht Club, the Wakayama Marina City Hotel (sometimes called the Royal Pines Hotel), the Kuroshio Ichiba (fish market), the Kuroshio Onsen (spa) and Porto Europa, a theme park created by MCA (Universal Studios). At that time, both MID and MCA were owned by Matsushita Electric Industrial Company (MEI), which has been rebranded to Panasonic since 2008. MEI bought MCA in 1989.\n\nThe Porto Europa theme park was created by MCA Planning and Development (P&D), which was Universal Studios' creative arm prior to its renaming as Universal Creative in 1997. The park was built using American specialty vendors and Japanese construction companies, and opened in July 1994. With a footprint of 4.5 acres (1.82109 hectare), Porto Europa consists of three themed areas: a French, an Italian and a Spanish town. There are three major attractions, a flume ride/dark ride combination, a motion simulator/film ride, and an indoor stunt show which is now closed, with the theater space empty. The smaller attractions at opening included a jazz club, disco, cinema, laser tag, and virtual reality installation. There are also retail outlets, restaurants, and street shows.\n\nThe High Dive ride is located in the Spanish Castle portion of the park. The load platform and splashdown pool are located outdoors, below the castle, with an observation deck/splash zone overhead. The ride vehicles ascend into the building, through an automated guillotine door, and into a spiraling fog vortex. Once at the top, the vehicle splashes down into a flume, which curves through the upper story of the building. This is the dark ride portion, which features a number of special effects including fog, blacklight effects, wind, animated figures and a 20 foot high parting waterfall. The vehicles then exit the building and curve around the rear of the castle before being released down the 65 foot slide into the splash pool. The ride system is by Arrow Dynamics. The ride is shown in the photograph reproduced to the right.\n\nThe Seafari simulator ride is in the French-themed village, and occupies the majority of the space in the main building. It features an extensive preshow, including a moon pool with a 29-foot submarine hanging over it, as if it has been launched and recovered from the deep below. Guests move from the moon pool area to the Aqualab where they meet Sammy, a CGI dolphin who appears to be swimming in a 13-foot tank at guests' eye level. From this space, guests move into a 15-passenger themed submarine, which is in the actual motion base theater. The Seafari motion bases are by Hughes Training.\nThe ride film is a 3.5 minute Computer-generated imagery (CGI) short, in color, produced by Rhythm & Hues. At the time, it was considered one of the best CGI animated films ever made. The film was later used at PortAventura Park in Spain, renamed WorldSea Odyssey 4D. It opened there in 1999. Universal Studios owned PortAventura World at the time.\n\nThe Viking Adventure Stunt Show is also located inside the Spanish Castle, occupying four floors, from the basement to the third level, the same level as the dark ride portion of the High Dive. The theatre space is an indoor amphitheater, featuring curved, steeply raked seating. Immediately opposite is a 110 foot wide curved plaster cyclorama approximately three stories high. The stage and set sits between the two. The rendering in the center left of the opening program gives some sense of the scale. The show itself is actually an adaptation of the Western Stunt Show, formerly at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida. Some of the recycled stunts include the 8.5 ton falling wall, a rotating swaypole which swings an actor over the audience, an exploding well, a slide-for-life, again over the audience, and a high fall onto a wood pile. In the case of Viking Adventure, each stunt is larger and more extreme-looking than their predecessors. New are the moving iceberg, fast elevator, high bridge, and the pool and diving well. The action is supported by massive lighting, sound, pyrotechnic and special effects systems. The lighting, sound and show control systems were advanced state-of-the-art installations at the time. While theme park show control systems have long made use of industrial automation, such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs), Viking Adventure was the first to make full use of MIDI Show Control to completely synchronize the mechanical effects, atmospheric effects, lighting console, pyrotechnic controller, and audio system.\n\nThe smaller attractions in the French-themed area include Laser Tech, a laser tag installation, the International Cinema, which featured a 20-minute custom-produced cartoon at opening, and a large French restaurant. The Italian village, located between the French and Spanish buildings, contains the bulk of the retail, an Italian restaurant, Virtuality, a virtual reality gaming space, Monte Carlo, an arcade, Club Coyote, a western-themed discothèque, and Blue Tone, a live jazz venue. The Spanish castle, with two major attractions, houses only an American casual restaurant on the deck above High Dive.\n\nAt the time Porto Europa was completed, the area immediately behind the site and across the canal, was empty. During the grand opening, the Japan Expo was held on this site for 72 days. The owner has since installed a non-themed ride park, which is often confused with Porto Europa proper. This newer area has more in common with an American state fair and carnival than a theme park. This area features iron rides, including two coasters, merry-go-rounds, water slides, and a Ferris wheel. The coasters are \"Round and Round\" (Meisho) and \"Pinestar\" (Vekoma).\n\nAn ichiba is a market, of which there are two in Marina City. The larger is a \"fisherman's wharf\"-style fish market, which sells both fresh-caught fish and cooked fish dishes. There are small fire pits available both inside and outside to allow guests to cook their purchases on site. Aside from the food, the principal attraction is a whole tuna filleting show. The building itself features 6,767.08 square meters of floor space on four levels. The smaller market is an outdoor farmers market, featuring fruit and vegetables from the local farmers.\n\nAn onsen is a Japanese hot spring bathing facility that can have freestanding facilities or be associated with a nearby inn or hotel. The facility at Marina City (sometimes referred to as Kishu Kuroshio Onsen) is a large stand-alone attraction which can be used independent of the island's hotel and theme park. It features both indoor and outdoor facilities, which includes a sauna and rock bath. The hot spring water comes from a 1500-meter-deep well.\n\nThe marina consists of approximately 1,100 in-water berths for craft up to 80 feet in length, and on-shore storage for smaller craft on trailers. The usual marina facilities are available, along with amenities including water, fuel, waste disposal and a powered boat lift. The marina opened in July, 1995. The harbor, and island generally, is protected by an extensive breakwater of approximately 920 meters in length. This breakwater is unique in Japan, as public access is permitted on extensive walkways and other public spaces, including a fishing pier. The design is called a \"water-affinity\" breakwater by the designer, and features vertical slit caissons and other safety features to allow safe access.\n"}

Helmut Damerius led the two groups from 1931 to 1933.\n\nAdrian Piotrovsky was the theatre's principle ideologue, and Dmitri Shostakovich composed some incidental music for a number of its productions.
