Abbey Home Media also are a producer of their own franchises, which includes the likes of \"Bump the Elephant\", \"Fun Song Factory\" and \"Baby Bright\".\n\nThe precessor of Abbey Home Media was Abbey Home Entertainment Group Limited (AHE) Abbey Home Entertainment was founded in 1989 by Ian and Anne Miles. AHE would acquire the Tempo Video brand name from WM Collins Video in 1990 and also later introduced other brand names:\n\n\nA subsidiary called Abbey Broadcast Communications was also founded during this time, which produced original content for AHE. According to Companieshouse, ABC is still in operation, even though they haven't made anything since 1999.\n\nIn Early 2000, Abbey Home Entertainment was acquired by \"Just Group PLC\". after a while, all of AHE's sub-brands except for Tempo Pre-School were folded into Just Group's home media subsidiary Just Entertainment. Newer releases would be released under ether 2 names.\n\nAnother predecessor of Abbey Home Media was Tempo Video, which was originally launched by video distributor MSD Video in 1987 as a kids-focused video label. After 2 years MSD transitioned the distribution of Tempo to Collins Video and then transitioned the label off to Abbey Home Entertainment within 1990, a year after the company was founded. The label was folded a short while after Abbey Home Entertainment was bought by Just Group in 2000.\n\nIn 2002, co-founder Ian Miles resigned from Just Group PLC, and he formed a new company under the Abbey name called Abbey Home Media Almost all of Just Group's properties were also taken by Abbey Home Media in the process. Abbey Home Media retained the Tempo Pre-School brand that Just Entertainment kept during their ownership of the Abbey brands and would later introduce the Tempo and Tempo TV Classics (Previously Tempo Classics) brands. Nowadays all of the releases are released under the single Abbey Home Media brand name.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2130", "title": "Aesthetics", "text": "Aesthetics\n\nAesthetics () is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature of art, beauty, and taste, with the creation and appreciation of beauty.\n\nIn its more technical epistemological perspective, it is defined as the study of subjective and sensori-emotional values, sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste. Aesthetics studies how artists imagine, create and perform works of art; how people use, enjoy, and criticize art; and what happens in their minds when they look at paintings, listen to music, or read poetry, and understand what they see and hear. It also studies how they feel about art—why they like some works and not others, and how art can affect their moods, beliefs, and attitude toward life.\n\nMore broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as \"critical reflection on art, culture and nature\". In modern English, the term aesthetic can also refer to a set of principles underlying the works of a particular art movement or theory: one speaks, for example, of the Cubist aesthetic.\n\nThe word \"aesthetic\" is derived from the Greek (\"aisthetikos\", meaning \"esthetic, sensitive, sentient, pertaining to sense perception\"), which in turn was derived from αἰσθάνομαι (\"aisthanomai\", meaning \"I perceive, feel, sense\" and related to (\"aisthēsis\", \"sensation\"). The term \"aesthetics\" was appropriated and coined with new meaning by the German philosopher Alexander Baumgarten in his dissertation \"Meditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus\" (\"Philosophical considerations of some matters pertaining the poem\") in 1735;\nBaumgarten chose \"aesthetics\" because he wished to emphasize the experience of art as a means of knowing. Aesthetics, a not very tidy intellectual discipline, is a heterogeneous collection of problems that concern the arts primarily but also relate to nature. even though his later definition in the fragment \"Aesthetica\" (1750) is more often referred to as the first definition of modern aesthetics.\n\nFor some, aesthetics is considered a synonym for the philosophy of art since Hegel, while others insist that there is a significant distinction between these closely related fields. In practice, aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily an art object), while artistic judgement refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an art work.\n\nPhilosophical aesthetics has not only to speak about art and to produce judgments about art works, but also has to give a definition of what art is. Art is an autonomous entity for philosophy, because art deals with the senses (i. e. the etymology of aesthetics) and art is as such free of any moral or political purpose. Hence, there are two different conceptions of art in aesthetics: art as knowledge or art as action, but aesthetics is neither epistemology nor ethics.\n\nAestheticians compare historical developments with theoretical approaches to the arts of many periods. They study the varieties of art in relation to their physical, social, and culture environments. Aestheticians also use psychology to understand how people see, hear, imagine, think, learn, and act in relation to the materials and problems of art. Aesthetic psychology studies the creative process and the aesthetic experience.\n\nAesthetics examines our affective domain response to an object or phenomenon Judgments of aesthetic value rely on our ability to discriminate at a sensory level. However, aesthetic judgments usually go beyond sensory discrimination.\n\nFor David Hume, delicacy of taste is not merely \"the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition\", but also our sensitivity \"to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind.\" Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for pleasure.\n\nFor Immanuel Kant (\"Critique of Judgment\", 1790), \"enjoyment\" is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but judging something to be \"beautiful\" has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation. Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once. Kant (1790) observed of a man \"If he says that canary wine is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and reminds him to say instead: It is agreeable to \"me\",\" because \"Everyone has his own (sense of) taste\". The case of \"beauty\" is different from mere \"agreeableness\" because, \"If he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he requires the same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things.\" Roger Scruton has argued similarly.\n\nViewer interpretations of beauty may on occasion be observed to possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and taste. Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty. Taste is a result of an education process and awareness of elite cultural values learned through exposure to mass culture. Bourdieu examined how the elite in society define the aesthetic values like taste and how varying levels of exposure to these values can result in variations by class, cultural background, and education. According to Kant, beauty is subjective and universal; thus certain things are beautiful to everyone. In the opinion of Władysław Tatarkiewicz, there are six conditions for the presentation of art: beauty, form, representation, reproduction of reality, artistic expression and innovation. However, one may not be able to pin down these qualities in a work of art.\n\nJudgments of aesthetical values seem often to involve many other kinds of issues as well. Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in instinctual ways to facial expressions, and even behaviours like the gag reflex. Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man's beard is disgusting even though neither soup nor beards are themselves disgusting. Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our physical reactions. For example, the awe inspired by a sublime landscape might physically manifest with an increased heart-rate or pupil dilation; physiological reaction may express or even cause the initial awe. As seen, emotions are conformed to 'cultural' reactions, therefore aesthetics is always characterized by 'regional responses', as Francis Grose was the first to affirm in his ‘Rules for Drawing Caricaturas: With an Essay on Comic Painting’ (1788), published in W. Hogarth, The Analysis of Beauty, Bagster, London s.d. (1791? [1753]), pp. 1–24. Grose can therefore be claimed to be the first critical 'aesthetic regionalist' in proclaiming the anti-universality of aesthetics in contrast to the perilous and always resurgent dictatorship of beauty.\n\nLikewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent. Victorians in Britain often saw African sculpture as ugly, but just a few decades later, Edwardian audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful. Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to sexual desirability. Thus, judgments of aesthetic value can become linked to judgments of economic, political, or moral value. In a current context, one might judge a Lamborghini to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values.\n\nAesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory. Likewise aesthetic judgments seem often to be at least partly intellectual and interpretative. It is what a thing means or symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging. Modern aestheticians have asserted that will and desire were almost dormant in aesthetic experience, yet preference and choice have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th-century thinkers. The point is already made by Hume, but see Mary Mothersill, \"Beauty and the Critic's Judgment\", in The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics, 2004. Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behaviour, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory one employs.\n\nA third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgments is how they are unified across art forms. For instance, the source of a painting's beauty has a different character to that of beautiful music, suggesting their aesthetics differ in kind. The distinct inability of language to express aesthetic judgment and the role of Social construction further cloud this issue.\n\nThe philosopher Denis Dutton identified six universal signatures in human aesthetics:\n\n\nArtists such as Hirschhorn have indicated that there are too many exceptions to Dutton's categories. For example, the installations of the contemporary artist Thomas Hirschhorn deliberately eschew technical virtuosity. People can appreciate a Renaissance Madonna for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions. \"Rules of composition\" that might be read into Duchamp's \"Fountain\" or John Cage's \"4′33″\" do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style recognizable at the time of the works' realization). Moreover, some of Dutton's categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory. Another problem is that Dutton's categories seek to universalize traditional European notions of aesthetics and art forgetting that, as André Malraux and others have pointed out, there have been large numbers of cultures in which such ideas (including the idea \"art\" itself) were non-existent.\n\nAesthetic ethics refers to the idea that human conduct and behaviour ought to be governed by that which is beautiful and attractive. John Dewey has pointed out that the unity of aesthetics and ethics is in fact reflected in our understanding of behaviour being \"fair\"—the word having a double meaning of attractive and morally acceptable. More recently, James Page has suggested that aesthetic ethics might be taken to form a philosophical rationale for peace education.\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the New Criticism school and debate concerning \"the intentional fallacy\". At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.\n\nIn 1946, William K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled \"The Intentional Fallacy\", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author's intention, or \"intended meaning\" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.\n\nIn another essay, \"The Affective Fallacy,\" which served as a kind of sister essay to \"The Intentional Fallacy\" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the reader-response school of literary theory. One of the leading theorists from this school, Stanley Fish, was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay \"Literature in the Reader\" (1970).\n\nAs summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay \"The Creation of Art\": \"Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms' assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic.\" These authors contend that: \"Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work.\"\n\nGaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: \"Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works.\" They quote Richard Wollheim as stating that, \"The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself.\"\n\nA large number of derivative forms of aesthetics have developed as contemporary and transitory forms of inquiry associated with the field of aesthetics which include the post-modern, psychoanalytic, scientific, and mathematical among others.\n\nEarly-twentieth-century artists, poets and composers challenged existing notions of beauty, broadening the scope of art and aesthetics. In 1941, Eli Siegel, American philosopher and poet, founded Aesthetic Realism, the philosophy that reality itself is aesthetic, and that \"The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites.\"\n\nVarious attempts have been made to define Post-Modern Aesthetics. The challenge to the assumption that beauty was central to art and aesthetics, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify \"beauty\" into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction between beauty and the sublime. What was new was a refusal to credit the higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the Rococo.\n\nCroce suggested that \"expression\" is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central. George Dickie suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities. Marshall McLuhan suggested that art always functions as a \"counter-environment\" designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society. Theodor Adorno felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience. Hal Foster attempted to portray the reaction against beauty and Modernist art in \"The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture\". Arthur Danto has described this reaction as \"kalliphobia\" (after the Greek word for beauty, κάλλος \"kallos\"). André Malraux explains that the notion of beauty was connected to a particular conception of art that arose with the Renaissance and was still dominant in the eighteenth century (but was supplanted later). The discipline of aesthetics, which originated in the eighteenth century, mistook this transient state of affairs for a revelation of the permanent nature of art. Brian Massumi suggests to reconsider beauty following the aesthetical thought in the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari. Walter Benjamin echoed Malraux in believing aesthetics was a comparatively recent invention, a view proven wrong in the late 1970s, when Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake analyzed links between beauty, information processing, and information theory. Denis Dutton in \"The Art Instinct\" also proposed that an aesthetic sense was a vital evolutionary factor.\n\nJean-François Lyotard re-invokes the Kantian distinction between taste and the sublime. Sublime painting, unlike kitsch realism, \"... will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see; it will please only by causing pain.\"\n\nSigmund Freud inaugurated aesthetical thinking in Psychoanalysis mainly via the \"Uncanny\" as aesthetical affect. Following Freud and Merleau-Ponty, Jacques Lacan theorized aesthetics in terms of sublimation and the Thing.\n\nThe relation of Marxist aesthetics to post-modern aesthetics is still a contentious area of debate.\n\nGuy Sircello has pioneered efforts in analytic philosophy to develop a rigorous theory of aesthetics, focusing on the concepts of beauty, love and sublimity. In contrast to romantic theorists Sircello argued for the objectivity of beauty and formulated a theory of love on that basis.\n\nBritish philosopher and theorist of conceptual art aesthetics, Peter Osborne, makes the point that \"'post-conceptual art' aesthetic does not concern a particular type of contemporary art so much as the historical-ontological condition for the production of contemporary art in general ...\". Osborne noted that contemporary art is 'post-conceptual in a public lecture delivered in 2010.\n\nGary Tedman has put forward a theory of a subjectless aesthetics derived from Karl Marx's concept of alienation, and Louis Althusser's antihumanism, using elements of Freud's group psychology, defining a concept of the 'aesthetic level of practice'.\n\nGregory Loewen has suggested that the subject is key in the interaction with the aesthetic object. The work of art serves as a vehicle for the projection of the individual's identity into the world of objects, as well as being the irruptive source of much of what is uncanny in modern life. As well, art is used to memorialize individuated biographies in a manner that allows persons to imagine that they are part of something greater than themselves.\n\nThe field of experimental aesthetics was founded by Gustav Theodor Fechner in the 19th century. Experimental aesthetics in these times had been characterized by a subject-based, inductive approach. The analysis of individual experience and behaviour based on experimental methods is a central part of experimental aesthetics. In particular, the perception of works of art, music, or modern items such as websites or other IT products is studied. Experimental aesthetics is strongly oriented towards the natural sciences. Modern approaches mostly come from the fields of cognitive psychology or neuroscience (neuroaesthetics).\n\nIn the 1970s, Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake were among the first to analyze links between aesthetics, information processing, and information theory.\n\nIn the 1990s, Jürgen Schmidhuber described an algorithmic theory of beauty which takes the subjectivity of the observer into account and postulates: among several observations classified as comparable by a given subjective observer, the aesthetically most pleasing one is the one with the shortest description, given the observer's previous knowledge and his particular method for encoding the data. This is closely related to the principles of algorithmic information theory and minimum description length. One of his examples: mathematicians enjoy simple proofs with a short description in their formal language. Another very concrete example describes an aesthetically pleasing human face whose proportions can be described by very few bits of information, drawing inspiration from less detailed 15th century proportion studies by Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer. Schmidhuber's theory explicitly distinguishes between what's beautiful and what's interesting, stating that interestingness corresponds to the first derivative of subjectively perceived beauty. Here the premise is that any observer continually tries to improve the predictability and compressibility of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and symmetries and fractal self-similarity. Whenever the observer's learning process (which may be a predictive artificial neural network; see also Neuroesthetics) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer bits than before, the temporary interestingness of the data corresponds to the number of saved bits. This compression progress is proportional to the observer's internal reward, also called curiosity reward. A reinforcement learning algorithm is used to maximize future expected reward by learning to execute action sequences that cause additional interesting input data with yet unknown but learnable predictability or regularity. The principles can be implemented on artificial agents which then exhibit a form of artificial curiosity.\n\nMathematical considerations, such as symmetry and complexity, are used for analysis in theoretical aesthetics. This is different from the aesthetic considerations of applied aesthetics used in the study of mathematical beauty. Aesthetic considerations such as symmetry and simplicity are used in areas of philosophy, such as ethics and theoretical physics and cosmology to define truth, outside of empirical considerations. Beauty and Truth have been argued to be nearly synonymous, as reflected in the statement \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty\" in the poem Ode on a Grecian Urn by John Keats, or by the Hindu motto \"Satyam Shivam Sundaram\" (Satya (Truth) is Shiva (God), and Shiva is Sundaram (Beautiful)). The fact that judgments of beauty and judgments of truth both are influenced by processing fluency, which is the ease with which information can be processed, has been presented as an explanation for why beauty is sometimes equated with truth. Indeed, recent research found that people use beauty as an indication for truth in mathematical pattern tasks. However, scientists including the mathematician David Orrell and physicist Marcelo Gleiser have argued that the emphasis on aesthetic criteria such as symmetry is equally capable of leading scientists astray.\n\nIn 1928, the mathematician George David Birkhoff created an aesthetic measure \"M = O/C\" as the ratio of order to complexity.\n\nSince about 2005, computer scientists have attempted to develop automated methods to infer aesthetic quality of images. Typically, these approaches follow a machine learning approach, where large numbers of manually rated photographs are used to \"teach\" a computer about what visual properties are of relevance to aesthetic quality. The Acquine engine, developed at Penn State University, rates natural photographs uploaded by users.\n\nThere have also been relatively successful attempts with regard to chess and music. A relation between Max Bense's mathematical formulation of aesthetics in terms of \"redundancy\" and \"complexity\" and theories of musical anticipation was offered using the notion of Information Rate.\n\nEvolutionary aesthetics refers to evolutionary psychology theories in which the basic aesthetic preferences of \"Homo sapiens\" are argued to have evolved in order to enhance survival and reproductive success. One example being that humans are argued to find beautiful and prefer landscapes which were good habitats in the ancestral environment. Another example is that body symmetry and proportion are important aspects of physical attractiveness which may be due to this indicating good health during body growth. Evolutionary explanations for aesthetical preferences are important parts of evolutionary musicology, Darwinian literary studies, and the study of the evolution of emotion.\n\nAs well as being applied to art, aesthetics can also be applied to cultural objects, such as crosses or tools. For example, aesthetic coupling between art-objects and medical topics was made by speakers working for the US Information Agency Art slides were linked to slides of pharmacological data, which improved attention and retention by simultaneous activation of intuitive right brain with rational left. It can also be used in topics as diverse as mathematics, gastronomy, fashion and website design.\n\nThe philosophy of aesthetics as a practice has been criticized by some sociologists and writers of art and society. Raymond Williams argues that there is no unique and or individual aesthetic object which can be extrapolated from the art world, but that there is a continuum of cultural forms and experience of which ordinary speech and experiences may signal as art. By \"art\" we may frame several artistic \"works\" or \"creations\" as so though this reference remains within the institution or special event which creates it and this leaves some works or other possible \"art\" outside of the frame work, or other interpretations such as other phenomenon which may not be considered as \"art\".\n\nPierre Bourdieu disagrees with Kant's idea of the \"aesthetic\". He argues that Kant's \"aesthetic\" merely represents an experience that is the product of an elevated class habitus and scholarly leisure as opposed to other possible and equally valid \"aesthetic\" experiences which lay outside Kant's narrow definition.\n\nTimothy Laurie argues that theories of musical aesthetics \"framed entirely in terms of appreciation, contemplation or reflection risk idealizing an implausibly unmotivated listener defined solely through musical objects, rather than seeing them as a person for whom complex intentions and motivations produce variable attractions to cultural objects and practices\".\n\n\n"}

Hence, Alias is similar to Taboo, but the only forbidden word in the explanations is the word to be explained. The game is played in teams of varying size, and fits well as a party game for larger crowds. The game is very competitive.\n\n\"Alias\" has been developed in Finland and is produced by Nelostuote Oy under the brand name Tactic. The game has been on the market since the early 1990s and is one of the most popular party games in Finland. Along the years, many different versions of the board game have appeared: As well as the \"New Alias\", the \"Alias\" family currently also includes the \"Junior Alias\" for children, the \"Alias\" travel game, and as the newest introduction, DVD \"Alias\".\n\nThe name \"Alias\" comes from the word \"alias\", meaning \"also known as\".\n\nThe board in \"Alias\" is a \"path\" consisting of sequential curving numbers on a red background. The game contains 8 numbered groups. The game is divided into turns of about one minute of length. The teams play in turns, and on each team's turn, one of the team members has to explain words on word cards to the other team members. The other team members take guesses at the word, and words that have been correctly guessed earn the team one point per word. Explanation mistakes (meaning the explainer uses the word to be explained, part of it, or a derivative of it), and words passed over without being guessed take points away. The players move on the board as many places as they have earned points on their turn. If, for example, the team lands on the number 7, the word to be explained from the cards is word number 7. The first team to reach the goal wins. The game is recommended for players over 7 years.\n\nThe \"New Alias\" is a version of \"Alias\", where the words are divided into 8 classes: 1. Things and Concepts, 2. People and Professions, 3. Adjectives, 4. Verbs. The numbered classes can include anything whatsoever. The game board's base colour is red and the squares of each category are played in turns.\n\nOn the flip side of the \"New Alias\" board is the \"Special Alias\" version of the board game: the rules are otherwise the same as in \"New Alias\", but the game has different classes: The world around us, Sports and exercise, Entertainment and culture, and Sayings and quotes. The classes Entertainment and culture and Sayings and quotes have special explanations, meaning that the first card contains a hint related to the word, and in the second card, the word to be explained is part of a saying or quote and the word to be explained is replaced, for example, with the word \"beep\". Both classes also contain normal explanations.\n\nOn the third game winner takes all on the party Alias version\n\n\"Junior Alias\" is otherwise like the normal \"Alias\", except there are also pictures to be explained and the words have been chosen to fit for children. The red colour of the board has been replaced with yellow, and the appearance is more child-friendly. This game is recommended for players over 5 years.\n\nThe DVD version of \"Alias\" is hosted by Marco Bjurström, and as well as word explanations, the game includes exercise. The game takes over an hour. A television and a DVD player are needed to play the DVD version of \"Alias\".\n\n"}

The marriage is cancelled, and Suprapto – seeing a vision of Wenangish, beckoning him – commits suicide by jumping into the river.\n\n\"Bengawan Solo\" was directed by Jo An Djan for Tan & Wong Bros., a company established by the Tan brothers, Khoen Yauw and Khoen Hian, and Wong brothers, Joshua and Othniel, in 1948. Jo had been a director for Populer Films before the Japanese occupation essentially shut down film production. The story was written by Tan Tjoei Hock and Fred Young. Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that the film was meant to draw as many tears as possible, using a formula reminiscent of most domestic productions since \"Terang Boelan\" in 1937: action, love, music, and beautiful scenery.\n\nThe black-and-white film starred Sofia WD, Rd Mochtar, Mohamad Mochtar, Dadang Ismail, S Waldy, Ratna Ruthinah, Churiani, Sukarsih, Sadijah, and Komariah. The film's theme song was the 1940 composition by Gesang Martohartono of the same name, \"Bengawan Solo\".\n\n\"Bengawan Solo\" was released by July 1949, one of eight domestic films produced that year. The film is likely lost, as are all Indonesian films from before 1950 according to American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider. However, JB Kristanto's \"Katalog Film Indonesia\" (\"Indonesian Film Catalogue\") records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.\n\nTwo years later Young wrote another film regarding the Solo River, \"Ditepi Bengawan Solo\". This work had a different plot and different cast. \"Bengawan Solo\" was remade in 1971, with Sofia WD, Willy Wilianto (Joshua Wong's son), and Bay Isbahi directing. In this remake, Wenangish (played by Rima Melati) died after being hit by a train.\n\n"}

Since then, the Andean country took part in the contest util the last edition in 2000 which was held again in Acapulco.\n\nEcuador's history in the Latin American song contest did not yield any victories. Teleamazonas and Ecuavisa, however, achieved a number of top 5 finishes.\n\nThe Ecuatorian debut in the OTI Festival was successful because of Hilda Murillo's fifth place. After that, the country didn't repeat that success, and in the following two years, the delegation ended in the bottom five of the scoreboard. However, in 1977 the female singer Marielisa with her song \"Sonreir cuando quiero llorar\" (To smile when I want to cry) took the Ecuadorian broadcasters back to fifth place. In contrast, in 1978, 1979 and 1980, Ecuador registered its worst placings ever with two last places with zero points.\n\nAfter some unsuccessful participations, in 1985 in Seville, the indigenous Quechua singer Jesús Fichamba recorded a second-place finish for Ecuador for the first time with his song \"La pinta, la niña y la Santa María\" in a reference to the three boats led by Christopher Colombus, who discovered America.

It is written, directed, edited, and scored by Jerrold Tarog, and is a sequel to the critically and commercially successful 2015 film \"Heneral Luna\", which chronicled Antonio Luna's life. Additional members of the ensemble cast include Carlo Aquino, Mon Confiado, Epy Quizon, Gwen Zamora, Empress Schuck, Alvin Anson, and Rafa Siguion-Reyna. It was released on September 5, 2018.\n\nFollowing the assassination of General Antonio Luna, the task of purging Luna's loyalists in the Philippine Army falls to General Gregorio \"Goyo\" del Pilar, a young, brash general and a favorite of President Emilio Aguinaldo. During a five-month break from combat, del Pilar and his unit, including his older brother Julian and his best friend Vicente Enriquez, capture Angel Bernal, the younger brother of Luna's former aides-de-camp, Manuel and José. They soon locate Manuel hiding with merchant Don Mariano Nable José and torture him into joining del Pilar's military personnel. When Manuel refuses, they kill him. Meanwhile, Joven Hernando, who now works for his uncle, is assigned to be del Pilar's photographer. \n\nWhile the Philippine Army relaxes and the American forces prepare for a second attack, General José Alejandrino, a Luna ally spared from the purge, meets with Apolinario Mabini, who has since resigned from Aguinaldo's cabinet after the death of Luna. Mabini implores Alejandrino to find out the real cause of Luna's death. Meanwhile, Aguinaldo joins del Pilar in Bulacan and promotes him to Major-General of Pangasinan, while del Pilar begins to court Remedios, the elusive daughter of Don Mariano. During his time, Aguinaldo meets Mabini and offers him the post of Chief Justice, to which Mabini reluctantly accepts. \n\nAlejandrino travels to Manila to negotiate with General Elwell Otis and General Arthur MacArthur Jr., who reject his proposal. Soon after, hostilities resume and the Filipino side is caught off-guard. Aguinaldo orders the march of the Army to Pozorrubio to meet with General Manuel Tinio and organize a fighting force. However, Tinio was defeated by the Americans, forcing Aguinaldo to retreat further north. The hard march, coupled with daily American attacks, the pressure of having to escort Aguinaldo's family and tensions between soldiers of Luna's old unit take a toll on del Pilar, leading him to ignore an American attack that wipes out their rearguard and captures Aguinaldo's mother and son. \n\nThe group soon arrive at Mount Tirad, where del Pilar devises a delaying strategy to buy Aguinaldo time to escape. Together with former Luna Sharpshooter Lieutenant García, fortified trenches were dug along the route of the mountain. The following day, the Americans quickly capture a town at the foot of the mountain but are initially unable to penetrate the defenses. They soon find a route around the mountain, appearing behind the trenches, and the Filipinos are quickly overrun. Del Pilar, inspired by a vision induced by his PTSD, resolves to finish the fight, but is shot and killed by an American sniper. As a result, his army's morale breaks and the defenders quickly surrender, with Aguinaldo being forced to flee. Joven and Kiko, Garcia's son, also flee, but Joven falls off a cliff after an encounter with an American soldier. The Americans strip del Pilar of his uniform and belongings and crudely bury him at Mount Tirad. \n\nAguinaldo is captured by the Americans in Palanan, Isabela on March 23, 1901, effectively ending the war. Held as a prisoner of war in Malacañang Palace, he is visited by his former aide-de-camp Manuel Quezon. Quezon surrendered to the Americans upon orders of his superior, General Tomás Mascardo, to be able to visit Aguinaldo to verify his capture and consult whether Mascardo should surrender. Aguinaldo instructed Quezon that the decision for Mascardo to surrender is up to Mascardo himself.\n\nMabini is also captured by the Americans and exiled to Guam where he pens his own narrative of the war entitled \"La Revolución Filipina\" (The Philippine Revolution). General Alejandrino's position is also overrun. Remedios receives a letter from del Pilar. \n\nIn a series of mid-credit scenes, Joven is rescued by Kiko and Eduardo Rusca, Luna's former aide; Aguinaldo in 1935 and his running mate, Raymundo Melliza, watch as his presidential campaign posters are replaced by those of Quezon.\n\nOther members of the ensemble cast are Christopher Aronson, RK Bagatsing, Carlo Cruz, Jason Dewey, Bret Jackson, Ethan Salvador, Lorenz Martinez, Karl Medina, Stephanie Sol, and Markki Stroem.\n\nPlans for a sequel to Jerrold Tarog's \"Heneral Luna\" went underway after its critical and commercial success. Tarog envisioned the sequel as being about Gregorio del Pilar, a young General who, like \"Heneral Luna\"s titular protagonist Antonio Luna, was among the Filipino historical figures during the Philippine–American War. Accordingly, Paulo Avelino, who played Del Pilar in \"Luna\", came aboard to reprise his role. \n\nTarog's research for \"Goyo\" involved studying biographies authored by Teodoro Kalaw as well as crossing the Tirad Pass. Tarog again incorporated several prominent Filipino figures including the likes of Apolinario Mabini and Emilio Aguinaldo, aiming for a scope larger than what was present in \"Heneral Luna\". Tarog co-wrote the film's screenplay with Rody Vera, who has said he had thoroughly studied \"Luna\" \"to understand the flow of the conversations and other details unique to each character\".\n\n\"Goyo\" entered pre-production in January 2017. To prepare his scenes, Avelino underwent horseback riding lessons in March 2017. Tarog projected a 50-day film shoot, which began in May 2017. The complete ensemble cast was also revealed in a photo taken during the May shoot, including the likes of Mon Confiado as Emilio Aguinaldo, Epy Quizon as Apolinario Mabini, Benjamin Alves as Manuel L. Quezon, Leo Martinez as Pedro Paterno, and Alvin Anson as José Alejandrino, reprising their roles from \"Heneral Luna\". Filming wrapped on November 27, 2017, lasting 60 days. The production cost for the film is said to be triple the budget of \"Luna\".\n\nOn February 15, 2017, a 20-minute short film entitled \"Angelito\" was exclusively released during the theatrical premiere of \"I'm Drunk, I Love You\" to serve as a prelude to \"Goyo\" and to intertwine both the sequel and \"Heneral Luna\". The film's teaser trailer was released on September 9, 2017. In May 2018, it was announced that the film would be released on September 5, 2018.\n\nThe film received praise for its acting, cinematography, music, and set design, which Zach Yonzon in Spot.PH highlighted as \"some of the best in Philippine cinema\". Yonzon also gave it a score of 3 out of 5, considering \"Goyo\" to be \"masterfully done\" though somewhat preposterously made. Writing for the Philippine edition of \"Esquire\", Miguel Escobar called the film captivating: \"It's a slow burn through the first half, but it's never boring and always beautiful.\" Fred Hawson of ABS-CBN News called it \"subdued but powerful\" and gave a score of 9 out of 10.\n\nIt was reported that the sequel to \"Goyo\" would revolve around President Manuel L. Quezon; as such, Benjamin Alves is set to reprise his role as Quezon.\n\n"}

Based on the book \"Cheer: Inside the Secret World of College Cheerleaders\" by journalist Kate Torgovnick, the series focuses in the lives of college cheerleaders, mainly Marti Perkins (Aly Michalka), a pre-law college student who has to join the cheerleading team, the Hellcats, in order to get the athletic scholarship she needs. The main cast also includes Ashley Tisdale, Robbie Jones, Heather Hemmens, Matt Barr, Gail O'Grady, and Sharon Leal.\n\nIn May 2010, \"Hellcats\" had been picked by The CW for the fall 2010–11 season. Initially with a 13-episode order, The CW aired the series after \"America's Next Top Model\" on Wednesday nights. The pilot episode aired on September 8, 2010, and became the first premiere to ever match or build on an \"America's Next Top Model\" lead-in since The CW began in 2006. The CW later gave a full season order for the series, with executives saying they were \"thrilled that it paid off for us\". On May 17, 2011, The CW announced that \"Hellcats\" would not be renewed for the 2011 fall schedule.\n\n\"Hellcats\" has been described as \"\"Election\" meets \"Bring It On\"\" by critics. It received mixed reviews during its first season, obtaining a Metacritic weighted average score of 51 percent, based on the impression of 22 critics. The series also earned a nomination in the 2011 People's Choice Awards.\n\n\"Hellcats\" follows Marti Perkins, a pre-law college student at Lancer University, who lost her scholarship and has no other choice but to join the college's cheer squad, the Hellcats, in order to obtain a new one. There she meets her new roommate and team captain Savannah Monroe, the injured flyer Alice Verdura, her new partner Lewis Flynn and the Hellcats coach Vanessa Lodge who hopes to win nationals, otherwise the cheer leading program will be cut. All the while, Marti also has to deal with her financially unstable and sometimes irresponsible mother, Wanda Perkins, whom she often has to bail out of difficult situations, and her best friend Dan Patch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hellcats\" is based on the book \"Cheer: Inside the Secret World of College Cheerleaders\" by journalist Kate Torgovnick and the series has been described as \"\"Election\" meets \"Bring It On\"\". Actor Tom Welling teamed with Kevin Murphy to executive produce the series, which was initially given the name \"Cheer\". The pilot episode was written by Murphy and directed by Allan Arkush. On May 18, 2010, \"The Hollywood Reporter\", \"Variety\" and \"Entertainment Weekly\" reported that The CW had picked up the series for the 2010–2011 television season and confirmed that Paul Becker would be the head choreographer for the series. Tisdale's character was originally named Sierra Sloan but was renamed Savannah Monroe in the press release.\n\nWhile presenting its 2010–11 season schedule on May 21, 2010, The CW officially confirmed the pick up of the series and announced its intention to air \"Hellcats\" after \"America's Next Top Model\" on Wednesday nights. \"TV Guide\" reported that Ashley Tisdale is the best paid of the cast, earning $30,000 per episode during the first season of the series.\n\nDuring the 2010 Television Critics Association press tour in Los Angeles on July 29, 2010, producer Murphy said the series \"was inspired by aspirational sports movies of the 1980s like \"Breaking Away\", \"Vision Quest\", and Pittsburgh-set \"Flashdance\", and also added that \"Hellcats\" is a show either for optimists or for people who are interested in learning the trade\". Producer Welling said he was attracted to the series mainly because of the script, and he also felt the cheerleaders' world had not yet been tapped into on television. When asked why it picked up \"Hellcats\", The CW replied saying the series is \"one of the underdogs\" and it liked the big production numbers.\n\nThe filming of the pilot episode took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada between April 13–21, 2010. The filming of the next episodes of the first season began on July 14 in Vancouver. The cast had two weeks of rehearsal for the pilot episode but after the series' fall season pick up, they will only have a week to rehearse the dance numbers for each episode. Former \"Fame\" actress and choreographer Debbie Allen directed the episode \"Pledging My Love\".\n\nThe CW Network attempted to break the Guinness World Records mark for the \"Largest Cheerleading Dance\" at a single venue by inviting cheerleading squads to participate in a five-minute choreographed \"Hellcats\" dance in September 2010. The mark was not broken as there were not enough cheerleaders present.\n\nOn March 8, 2010, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" announced that Aly Michalka and Gail O'Grady were the first actresses to be cast in the series. Michalka would play the lead role of Marti Perkins, a college girl who decided to join the \"Hellcats\", and O'Grady was to portray Wanda Perkins, Marti's mother. The site later announced that actress Ashley Tisdale was cast as Savannah Monroe (then known as Sierra Sloane), the fiercely intense captain of the Hellcats.\n\nMatt Barr was cast as Dan Patch, a womanizer who quietly pines for Marti. On April 5, 2010, it was reported that actors Robbie Jones and Heather Hemmens were cast. Jones would portray the male lead, a cheerleading \"base\" who falls for Marti, and Hemmens to play a cheerleader sidelined with a wrist injury. On April 8, 2010, it was reported that actress Sharon Leal was cast as Vanessa Lodge, a former Hellcat star who now serves as the squad's coach. Elena Esovolva was cast as Patty \"The Wedge\" Wedgerman, a lesbian cheerleader and a base for the squad.\n\nOn April 14, 2010, it was announced that Ben Browder was cast as Red Raymond, Lancer University's football coach. On May 21, 2010, it was announced that the role was being recast and possibly retooled as well, although Browder had already shot scenes for the pilot episode. Raymond's role was later given to Jeff Hephner. On July 13, one day before the beginning of filming, D. B. Woodside was cast as Derrick Altman, a \"handsome young physician who takes care of the Hellcats cheerleaders\".\n\nProducer Kevin Murphy confirmed that Gale Harold would guest star in the series as one of Marti's law professors. Michalka added that Harold would appear in the third episode of the first season and had a multiple-episode arc. In late November 2010, AJ Michalka was cast in a recurring role as a girl who works at a record store near Lancer University and befriends Marti. Camille Sullivan was added to the supporting cast in February 2011 to portray Red Reymond's ex-wife.\n\nOn January 18, 2011, it was announced that Esovolova would not be returning to the show. Michalka has said that it was difficult for the writers to incorporate her storylines with the others.\n\nDuring the 2010 Television Critics Association press tour held in Los Angeles on July 29, 2010, lead actresses Michalka and Tisdale were asked about the idea of singing on the show. They stated that they plan to keep their music careers separate from the series, although Michalka advised that she would sing in the fourth episode. In addition to that, Michalka's band 78violet recorded \"Belong Here\", which served as the theme song for \"Hellcats\". It was later released into digital stores.\n\nExecutive producer Kevin Murphy confirmed in an interview that a soundtrack would be released for the series, which would include the theme song and other songs recorded for the series. He later added \"So we are building a library of material. Once we have enough, we're gonna put it on iTunes and definitely do a soundtrack album.\"\nSongs covered for the series include \"The Letter\" originally by The Box Tops, Sting's \"Brand New Day\", Squeeze's \"Tempted\" and The Go-Go's hit \"We Got the Beat\". Canadian singer Fefe Dobson recorded \"Rockstar\", an exclusive song for the series that was played during the \"A World Full of Strangers\" episode. \"Rockstar\" was ultimately released on the iTunes Deluxe Edition of Dobson's album \"Joy\". As previously promised by Murphy, a digital EP featuring five of the songs recorded for the series was released on November 30, 2010, via Warner Bros. Records.\n\nThe first season of \"Hellcats\" also included live performances by guest musicians, including Hey Monday, Faber Drive, Fefe Dobson, 3OH!3 featuring Ashley Tisdale, Elise Estrada and Ciara.\n\nThe first and only season of \"Hellcats\" consisted of 22 episodes. The pilot episode was broadcast on September 8, 2010. The initial order for the series was thirteen episodes. On September 23, 2010, due to successful ratings, The CW ordered six more scripts for the first season, although its production order was still at thirteen. On October 22, 2010, \"Variety\" announced that The CW had given a full season order for the series. The network said they took risks this year but they were \"thrilled that they've paid off for us\".\n\n\"Hellcats\" aired on Wednesdays at 9–10 pm until December 1, 2010, when the eleventh episode aired. Starting January 25, 2011, The CW moved \"Hellcats\" to Tuesday nights at 9–10 pm, following \"One Tree Hill\".\n\nThe show has received mixed reviews, with Metacritic giving it a score of 51 percent, based on reviews from 22 critics. It was praised and criticized by critics in several round-up reviews of 2010 in television. \"Los Angeles Times\" had a good first impression of the pilot episode, saying \"Hellcats\" has a predictable story but, on the other hand, Michalka and Tisdale seem perfect for their roles. The newspaper also wrote the cheerleading world portrayed in the series is a \"fun and deep world to explore\". The journal later gave a complete review of the series, comparing it to 1983's film \"Flashdance\" aimed squarely at audiences too young for \"Gossip Girl\" but too old for \"Hannah Montana\".\n\nVerne Gay of \"Newsday\" praised Michalka's performance in the series, while \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised the series itself and said it has \"multilayered characters that defy expectations\".\nMara Reinstein of \"Us Weekly\" gave an early review of the first episode of the series, saying \"Hellcats\" has \"plenty of winning elements\" but added that the series lacks spirit. She also praised the performance and Marti's relationship with her mother.\nABC News listed \"Hellcats\" as one of the ten best new shows of 2010's fall season and described the series as \"almost laughably formulaic\" and added it \"works like a charm\".\nBrian Lowry of \"Variety\" praised the series' promise, and said that the series has a \"Glee\"-like element in the script, while also criticizing Michalka and acclaiming O'Grady's performance. Lowry also added \"Hellcats\" premiere \"isn't quite unabashedly trashy enough to completely qualify as a guilty pleasure\".\n\nCurt Wagner of \"ChicagoNow\" said the series is predictable and has unrealistic situations, and criticized the lack of fun in the jokes. The journal also praised Tisdale's performance, claiming she was the one who made him laugh the most. \nAlessandra Stanley of \"The New York Times\" criticized Michalka's performance and called the series a \"soft-porn music video for teenagers\". \"Washington Post\"'s Hank Stuever was critical about the pilot episode, describing it as \"mean-spirited, painfully dumb and badly acted\". He also wrote \"Hellcats\" is the opposite to Fox's \"Glee\".\n\nThe pilot episode \"A World Full of Strangers\" averaged a total of 3.0 million viewers and scored a 2.0 rating in the network's target audience of women 18–34, which marks the first premiere to ever match or build on an \"America's Next Top Model\" lead-in since The CW began. \"Hellcats\" also delivered the largest non-\"Top Model\" performance in The CW's Wednesday 9–10 pm time period in 3 years since the \"Gossip Girl\" series premiere. On September 10, the network aired an encore of the pilot episode which averaged a total of 2.42 million viewers and won the hour with adults 18–49.\n\n\"Hellcats\" delivered The CW's most watched Tuesday of the season with 2.2 million viewers watching \"Papa, Oh Papa\", its 12th episode and the first in its new Tuesday 9–10 pm timeslot. Ratings fell rapidly as the series progressed, with the nineteenth episode, \"Before I Was Caught\", hitting a series low, with less than a million viewers watching it on April 27, 2011. The finale was watched by 1.16 million viewers.\n\nThe series averaged 2.11 million viewers with live +7 day DVR viewing.\n\nWhile presenting its 2010–11 season schedule on May 21, 2010, The CW announced its intention to air \"Hellcats\" in the United States after \"America's Next Top Model\" on Wednesday nights starting September 8, 2010, at 9 pm.

{"id": "201056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201056", "title": "Ideograph (rhetoric)", "text": "Ideograph (rhetoric)\n\nAn ideograph or virtue word is a word frequently used in political discourse that uses an abstract concept to develop support for political positions. Such words are usually terms that do not have a clear definition but are used to give the impression of a clear meaning. An ideograph in rhetoric often exists as a building block or simply one term or short phrase that summarizes the orientation or attitude of an ideology. Such examples notably include <liberty>, <freedom>, <democracy> and <rights>. Rhetorical critics use chevrons or angle brackets (<>) to mark off ideographs.\n\nThe term ideograph was coined by rhetorical scholar and critic Michael Calvin McGee (1980) describing the use of particular words and phrases as political language in a way that captures (as well as creates or reinforces) particular ideological positions. McGee sees the ideograph as a way of understanding of how specific, concrete instances of political discourse relate to the more abstract idea of political ideology. Robertson defines ideographs as “political slogans or labels that encapsulate ideology in political discourse.” Meanwhile, Celeste Condit and John Lucaites, influenced by McGee, explain, “Ideographs represent in condensed form the normative, collective commitments of the members of a public, and they typically appear in public argumentation as the necessary motivations or justifications for action performed in the name of the public.” Ideographs are common in advertising and political discourse.\n\nMcGee uses the term in his seminal article “The ‘Ideograph’: A Link Between Rhetoric and Ideology” which appeared in the \"Quarterly Journal of Speech\" in 1980. He begins his essay by defining the practice of ideology as practice of political language in specific contexts—actual discursive acts by individual speakers and writers. The question this raises is how does this practice of ideology create social control.\n\nMcGee’s answer to this is to say that “political language which manifests ideology seems characterized by slogans, a vocabulary of ‘ideographs’ easily mistaken for the technical terminology of political philosophy.” He goes on to offer his definition of “ideograph”: “an ideograph is an ordinary-language term found in political discourse. It is a high order abstraction representing commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal.”\n\nAn ideograph, then, is not just any particular word or phrase used in political discourse, but one of a particular subset of terms that are often invoked in political discourse but which does not have a clear, univocal definition. Despite this, in their use, ideographs are often invoked precisely to give the sense of a clearly understood and shared meaning. This potency makes them the primary tools for shaping public decisions. It is in this role as the vocabulary for public values and decision-making that they are linked to ideology.\n\nThere is no absolute litmus test for what terms are or are not ideographs. Rather, this is a judgment that must be made through the study of specific examples of discourse. However, McGee (and others who have followed him) have identified several examples of ideographs or virtue words in Western liberal political discourse, such as <liberty>, <property>, <freedom of speech>, <religion>, and <equality>. In each case, the term does not have a specific referent. Rather, each term refers to an abstraction which may have many different meanings depending on its context. It is in their mutability between circumstances that give the terms such rhetorical power. If the definition of a term such as <equality> can be stretched to include a particular act or condition, then public support for that act or condition is likely to be stronger than it was previously.\n\nBy encapsulating values which are perceived to be widely shared by the community, but which are in fact highly abstract and defined in very different ways by individuals, ideographs provide a potent persuasive tool for the political speaker. McGee offers the example of Richard Nixon’s attempt to defend his decision not to turn over documents to Congress during the Watergate scandal by invoking “the principle of confidentiality.” Recognizing that his refusal to submit to Congress could be seen as a violation of the \"rule of law\", Nixon pitted \"the principle of confidentiality” against the “rule of law,” despite the fact that these two ideographs would, in the abstract, not likely be seen as in conflict with one another. Nixon, in an attempt to expand the understanding of “the principle of confidentiality” to cover his own specific refusal to cooperate with Congress, used the abstractness of the term to his benefit, claiming that right to confidentiality was the more central term.\n\nWhile the term has remained mostly in this sphere of academic rhetorical criticism, some political consultants and practitioners are becoming savvy to this art.\n\nIdeographs appear in advertising and political campaigns regularly, and are crucial to helping the public understand what is really being asked of them. For example, “equality” is a term commonly used in political discourse and rarely defined. It can refer to a situation in which all people have the same opportunities, or a condition in which social resources are distributed uniformly to different individuals and groups. The former is the more commonly used definition in US history, according to Condit & Lucaites, although in a socialist or left-leaning political state, the term may refer foremost to the distribution of social resources. Condit and Lucaites depict the racial facet of equality as the dominant meaning in an American context of political discourse, since 1865.\n\nAnother important ideograph used specifically by U.S. presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush after the 9/11 attacks is <terrorism>. The term does not have a clear or specific definition, but when applied to the context in the fear-stricken country after the devastating attacks in 2001, this term held significant weight and meaning to Americans all across the country. Kelly Long explores Obama’s discourse on the <War on Terror> and states that “by developing an ideological justification for the conflicts that the United States was involved in at the time, Obama remedied much of the damage done by the Bush administration”. Obama justified the <War on Terror> by addressing the nation and saying that in order to protect the <rule of law> and <democratic values>, we must fight against <terrorism>. Obama used this term to his advantage and made <terrorism> appear to be a common enemy and fighting back was the common cause. This use of the ideograph unified the country creating a sense of identity for American citizens, “defining what the nation stands for and against. The term divides those who are civilized from those who are uncivilized, those who defend economic freedom from those who would attack America’s way of life and those who support democracy from those who would disrupt it”.\n\nMarouf Hasian discusses how key ideographs representative of a society’s commitments change over time, particularly in the name of <liberty>, <equality>, or <privacy> epitomized in eugenics. From the 1900s-1930s, Americans justified the restriction of reproductive rights based on medical, social, economic, and political considerations, but were appalled when the Nazis used some of the same arguments in their creation of the “perfect race\".\n\nWhile rhetorical critics identify these terms as ideographs, political leaders viewed each other’s terms as \"glittering generalities,” as Lincoln first identified his opponent's words.\n\nIn addition to practitioners, corporate marketing and political consulting use key terms in this way, concentrating on the image and branding of terms. For example, Frank Luntz tests audience reaction to certain words or phrases using dial technology, a mechanism which instantaneously shows moment by moment reactions to speeches or presentations. This research has been extremely beneficial to his clients, as they can utilize ideographs as \"trigger words\" in an advertising campaign.\n\nThere are three primary ways in which the concept of the ideograph is important to rhetorical critics. First, it suggests a way of studying political ideology using concrete instances of language use. By showing how looking at specific uses of key words and phrases in political language reveal underlying ideological commitments, McGee offers a concrete method for understanding the highly abstract concept of ideology.\n\nSecond, the definition of the ideograph makes clear that the rhetorical study of a term is different from a legal, historical, or etymological study of a term. Unlike other perspectives that focus on how a term has changed over time, a rhetorical study of a term focuses on the forces involved in the creation of these meanings. In short, a rhetorical study of a term is the study of the use of that term in practice.\n\nThis leads to a third key aspect of what the concept of the ideograph offers to rhetorical critics. McGee notes that the study of a term must not, and should not, be limited to its use in “formal discourse.” Instead, the critic is much more likely to gain a better understanding of an ideograph by looking at how it is used and depicted in movies, plays, and songs, as well as how it is presented in educational texts aimed at children. This moves the study of ideology beyond the limits of social philosophy or even political discourse as traditionally conceived (i.e., “great speeches by great men”).\n\n\"An ideograph is a culturally biased, abstract word or phrase drawn from ordinary language, which serves a constitutional value for a historically situated collectivity.\"\nThere exists a culturally-specific understanding in each culture about what an ideograph means. Ideographs in rhetoric are culturally specific but recur inter-culturally; meaning the understanding of one ideograph can be used and interpreted differently across cultures. The idea may be different from culture to culture, but this doesn’t mean some aspects won’t be the same in one or more cultures. Such as the concept of femininity that exists cross-culturally to define ideas about women, yet one can expect these ideas from culture to culture.\n\nAt the end of his essay defining the ideograph, McGee says that\n“A complete description of an ideology . . . will consist of (1) the isolation of a society’s ideographs, (2) the exposure and analysis of the diachronic structure of every ideography, and (3) characterization of synchronic relationships among all the ideographs in a particular context.”\nSuch an exhaustive study of any ideology has yet to materialize, but many scholars have made use of the ideograph as a tool of understanding both specific rhetorical situations as well as a broader scope of ideological history. As a teacher, McGee himself made use of the ideograph as a tool for structuring the study of the rise of liberalism in British public address, focusing on ideographs such as <property>, <patriarchy>, <religion>, <liberty>. Other scholars have made a study of specific uses of ideographs such as <family values> and <equality>. Some critics have gone beyond the idea that an ideograph must be a verbal symbol and have expanded the notion to include photographs. and objects represented in mass media.\n\n\n"}

It is often abbreviated to the acronym CIRT as in French the group is called the Centre International de Recherche Théâtrale. The centre is a multicultural theatrical research and production company based out of the Bouffes du Nord theatre in Paris since 1974. The first three years of the company were taken up by exploring a fundamental theatrical question (see below)\n\nBrook had previously been sponsored for limited periods by Jean-Louis Barrault or the RSC (at the Roundhouse). Brook and Rozan acquired sufficient funding to sustain Brook's work for three years. Working with a core company and several visiting collaborators. \nA budget of $1 million was established: $100,000 to set up the organization, and $300,000 for each year from 1971-1973. Money was raised from the French government and various international foundations (Ford Foundation, Gulbenkian Foundation and Anderson Foundations)\nMoney also came from the government of Iran in the form of a commission for a work at the Shiraz/Persepolis festival in 1971. Work was begun even though the full three-year budget was not secured at the outset.\n\nThis multinational assembly of actors, dancers, musicians and other performers travelled widely in the Middle East and Africa in the early 1970s. This was as a three-year 'pilgrimage' to answer the question \"What were the common stories, the recognizable shorthands, the instant abstractions, the shared outlines of story and character with which an international group could work?\"\nOn this three-year sojourn, they produced two major works \"Orghast\" I & II, performed in 1971 at the Shiraz Arts Festival in Iran in the Achaemenid ruins of Persepolis and Naqsh-e Rostam, and \"The Conference of Birds\" developed in West Africa and completed in 1974 at BAM in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n\n\n"}

It was written and produced by rapper-producer Missy Elliott and commissioned following the delay and subsequent reconstruction of Monica's 2002 album, \"All Eyez on Me\". One out of a handful of tracks which Elliott contributed, the song incorporates elements of 1970s-style soul, as well as hip hop, and is built around excerpts of the record \"It's a Terrible Thing to Waste Your Love\" as written by Lee Hatim and released by The Masqueraders in 1976. Rapper-producer Kanye West, whose 2005 \"Freshmen Adjustment\" mixtape recording \"Apologize\" the track is based on, is listed as the song's co-producer.\n\nJ Records released \"Knock Knock\", alongside fellow Elliott production \"Get It Off,\" as one of two singles following leading single \"So Gone\" during the third quarter of 2003. The song was lauded by critics, who praised its streetwise production and Monica's rap part on the track. A moderate success at the charts, it peaked at number 75 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 24 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Its accompanying music video, directed by Chris Robinson, was filmed as a two-part story with \"So Gone\".\n\n\"Knock Knock\" was written and produced by Missy Elliott for Mass Confusion Productions, with additional production by Kanye West. Lee Hatim is also credited in the song because it contains excerpts from The Masquerader' 1975 single, \"It's a Terrible Thing to Waste Your Love.\" West previously sampled the track in his own demo recording, \"Apologize\", which was later released on his 2005 mixtape \"Freshmen Adjustment\". \"Knock Knock\" was recorded by Carlos Bedoya at The Hit Factory Criteria in Miami, Florida with further assistance from Marcella Araica. Scott Kieklak mixed the song, while mastering was overseen by Tom Coyne. Elliott also provided additional vocals.\n\nThe song is one out of three Elliott-produced records on \"After the Storm\", commissioned by J Records head and executive producer Clive Davis after the release of Elliott's acclaimed studio album \"Under Construction\" (2002) and the delay of Monica's original third studio album \"All Eyez on Me\" the year before. It was conceived during a studio session week in Miami in early 2003, and was produced as a sequel to \"So Gone,\" another Elliott track. In an interview with \"MTV News\" at the 2003 BET Awards, Monica stated that \"'Knock Knock' is [...] like a follow-up to 'So Gone,' just saying that, 'All right, we went through all that stuff, now it's time for you to get lost. This is the end of the road for you.' So, it's kind of like a 'get back' record.\" Commenting on the recording process, she added: \"She [Elliott] doesn't have any fear [...] When she goes in the studio, her goal is to be creative and to give something new and she could care less what else is current. And she creates new trends by doing that.\"\n\n\"Knock Knock\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Allmusic editor Andy Kellman felt that the song, along with Elliott's other contributions on the album, provides \"a bulk of the most exciting material, with just the right amount of swagger added to the singer's more wide-eyed personality of the '90s.\" Melisa Tang from \"The Situation\" called Monica's vocals \"exceptional\" and felt that she \"does a pretty decent job\" at emceeing on the track. \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Vanessa Jones declared \"Knock Knock\" a \"streetwise party anthem.\" \"Billboard\" ranked the song among the album's highlights.\n\nFirst released in the United States, \"Knock Knock\" debuted at number 89 on the national \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in the week of October 2, 2003, the fifth-highest debut of the week. The single remained eighteen weeks on the chart, but as it failed to climb any higher during its runwith peak positions at number 75, the song eventually became Monica's lowest-charting, video-accompanied single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 since 1999's \"Street Symphony\". Just as predecessor, \"So Gone,\" the track was more successful on \"Billboard\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s component charts: \"Knock Knock\" reached number 24 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number 37 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart. The remix of the single featured producer Kanye West.\n\nThe music video for \"Knock Knock\" was shot by director Chris Robinson, and produced by Dawn Rose for Partizan Entertainment. It was filmed in various locations throughout Miami, Florida on in mid-late July 2003, and widely serves as the sequel (\"Part II\") to the video for \"So Gone\", the first single released from \"After the Storm\". The video features a second appearance by actor Derek Luke (Antwone Fisher), who plays Monica's boyfriend, and intercuts a clip of simultaneously released club single \"Get It Off\" with a dance scene.\n\nThe \"Knock Knock\" video premiered worldwide in July 2003.

His father was of Persian descent and his mother of Polish descent. Etta Benjamin (1924–2009) was his wife, his business partner, his stage audio and lighting expert, and a fellow accomplished modern artist. She was born in St. Louis to Ida and Nat Perkins who come from Polish/Russian descent.\n\nAt fourteen years old, Le Roy began working at an ice cream shop during the Depression to help his family. He always liked to work with hands. He began performing his own puppet shows for children in a Chicago candy shop. His first stage act experience began in 1939 at the New York World's Fair when he helped a marionette act. Then he went on the road with his own marionette act.\n\nHis Le Roy Brothers Marionette act required two people on the stage to manipulate the marionettes, initially included his brother, Melvin Benjamin, as the other marionettist and later his brother-in- law, Earl Perkins, who replaced Melvin. He married his wife, Etta Perkins in 1946, who managed the behind-the-scenes audio and lights production.\n\nThe Le Roy Brothers Marionettes (1939–1955) was one of the most celebrated and requested vaudeville acts in America, showcasing the top vaudeville stars. The marionettes which astounded audiences in disbelief included lifelike comedians and actors: humorous Danny Thomas, Jimmy Durante performing with piano, Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis; and drummer Gene Krupa whose drums would explode from being played with .38 caliber blanks going off, amongst other favorite characters such as the original woman on the moon, breakaway detaching fluorescent skeletons and jitterbug dancers, and a clown blowing up balloons. They would often break the \"third wall\" and bring the marionettes into the audience as part of their unique routine. This is one example why most consider Le Roy the master in his craft. He is considered the best marionettist of all time.\n\nThe Le Roy Brothers Marionettes performed at all of the popular state of the art theatres of their time including: Chez Paree, 5100 Club, Club Royale, Club Carnival, Roxy Theatre New York, RKO Palace Theatre, the Olympia, and The Normandie Roof. Their act opened for Danny Thomas, Rosemary Clooney, amongst others; while Joan Blondell occasionally participated with the marionette routine. Not very many vaudeville acts made the transition from live stage to television. The Le Roy Brothers Marionettes was one of the acts that did from television's \"The Toast of the Town\" (aka: The Ed Sullivan Show) Season 2 Episode 47 aired on August 6, 1950, had their own network TV show \"Sandy Strong\" sponsored by Ovaltine, and was on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" Season 1 in 1955 With the transition to TV, some vaudeville performers became even more popular to become household names and segue onward to film. Those performers include Danny Thomas, Jimmy Durante, Rosemary Clooney, Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis…the very same people who were perhaps first immortalized by the Le Roy Brothers Marionettes.\n\nDanny Thomas and Le Roy created the closest relationship. In the early years, when Danny was in vaudeville as a stand-up comedian, Danny would always ask Le Roy to be his opening act. Le Roy opened for Danny for two years in a row at the Chez Paree in Chicago. Then Danny went on to be a famous television actor/producer. Later, he founded the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Every time at the hospital's annual fundraising event, Danny would immediately seek out Le Roy in the audience as a true testament to their enduring friendship that lasted decades. Danny wrote a musical interlude about Le Roy's act singing \"I'm just a marionette tied to the strings of your heart\". Le Roy also fostered close friendships with Broadway/TV actor Jack Soo and singer Nat King Cole and amongst others.\n\nThe most respectable agent would often reach out to Le Roy to pitch new projects. Reporters of that time stated the Le Roy Brother Marionettes performance was \"the best marionette act in show business\".\n\nAfter vaudeville, LeRoy and Etta continued their creative entrepreneurial success as a framing and fine art business called the Hillside House of Originals, and then they leased out their production space to BET (Black Entertainment Television) for several years.\n"}

Interactive Entertainment, released on September 14, 2010. It is based on the , and includes some elements from the books. The game is available for PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 as well as Nintendo DS. The game takes place during the events of the movie.\n\nThe story of the game follows the tale of Shard and his friends. The story coincides with the plot of the movie.\nIn the Canyonlands, The Glauxian Monks worshiped the owl god Glaux, hidden away from the strifes of life. Surtr and the Pure Ones had been defeated years ago by Lyze of Kiel and the land had been returned to peace. However, during the watch of a young guard named Grettir, the Monastery was attacked by Hagsfiends. After losing most of what he knew as his family, he was plagued of guilt and many others who had heard the story branded him a traitor and a coward. After many years of isolation, Grettir took a mate named Lygeia and had an egg together. On the night that the owlet was to hatch, the nest of Grettir was attacked by owls and they killed the Grettir and his mate, but the owlet, now named Shard, survived.\n\nShard charges into battle, at the side of Allomere, destroying catapults and defeating hagsfiends. But as the battle continues, Shard gets surrounded by hagsfiends and as they collapse in for the kill, Shard wakes up from his dream and we are introduced to our two main characters, Shard and Parzival. Allomere, a character from the Legends of the Guardians movie is the ryb for both of the students. As Shard takes offense to Parzival insulting his father, it escalates into a fight between the two owls and Allomere gives the flint mops, or work for punishment. Ezylryb asks to take care of flint mops. The flint mop is lighting torches for the Great Tree and just as Shard and Parzival finish their job, the Search and Rescue chaw comes in with a band of owlets, later revealed to be Soren, Gylfie, Twilight and Digger, and they are being attacked by a murder of crows. After Shard and Parvizal had cleared away the crows, the owlets went to parliament to tell them the story St. Aegolius and what the Pure Ones were doing. Parliament came to the decision that Allomere would go to the canyonlands to verify the truth of Soren's claim. After the decision, Ezylryb gave Shard the task of secret missions as a Guardian and set off to the Desert Kingdom of Kuneer.\n\nShard is tasked with finding an eagle named Streak and finding out the cause for the disappearance of young owlets in the area. Shard and Parzival find Streak imprisoned by bats allied with the Pure Ones and free him. Streak becomes Shard's wingman along with Parzival and they go on missions for the rest of the story. Streak reveals that the owlet snatching is true and that the bats are being rewarded for their loyalty by being given some Non-Tyto owlets. Shard and his band go on a mission to find the hideout by destroying bat sanctuaries to make them reveal the location of the hideout. After one of the bats told Streak it was east of the sanctuary to find the secret hideout filled with bats and Pure Ones. After they defeat the defenses of the hideout, reinforcements come to defend the hideout, which guarantees the rumors of the owlets being held there. The group finds some bats still taking owlets from nests and after rescuing them, the group realizes that these problems aren't going to stop unless they take the fight to the bats. After a small attack on the Streak's Nest, the band goes and devises a plan to force the bats out of the hiding places within the compound by forcing them out with fire. The battle becomes more intense as the hideouts are burnt out and the band defeats the defenses. After what seemed like a victory, the Bat Chieftain comes out of hiding to fight with the protagonists. After vanquishing both the Chieftain and what remained of the bats, they free a wandering hermit named Uriah, who tells them that the Pure Ones are working with the bats to gain control of a mysterious substance called flecks. He asks to be part of Shard's band and becomes one of his wingmen and the band returns to the Great Tree to inform them about what was happening in the Desert of Kuneer.\n\nShard is tasked with finding the activities of the Pure Ones have in the Forest of Tyto and finding locals who could know what they are doing. Shard and Parzival follow a squadron of Pure Ones who lead them to a prison with resistance fighters locked up in them.\n\nAccording to \"GameSpot\", the gameplay is airborne combat. The player locks on to enemy owls or structures, and the player has the option to attack. If the player chooses to do so, the player-controlled owl will \"go zooming toward your enemy and wallop it with your claws\" as stated in the review. \"GameSpot\" also stated that there are some parts where the player has to navigate through gates in a specific amount of time. The player can choose between four owl species to play as before the game starts, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. These include barn owl, spotted owl, great gray owl, and great horned owl.\n\nThe original musical soundtrack of the \"Legend of the Guardians\" video game was composed by Winifred Phillips and produced by Winnie Waldron. The soundtrack was released on iTunes by WaterTower Music, a division of Warner Bros. Entertainment. The second track on the album, \"With Hearts Sublime\", is a winner of the 2010 Hollywood Music in Media Award in the category \"Best Original Song: Video Game\".\n\n\"Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole\" received largely mixed and average reviews. According to Metacritic, the Xbox 360 version has an average critic score of 60 out of 100 based on 13 reviews. While acknowledging its gameplay and other elements as commendable, the majority of critics noted the game's short play time and replay value as a major pitfall. \"GameSpot\" gave the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions a 6/10 rating. \"Game Informer\" awarded it 7.25 out of 10 and said \"Though limited in scope and complexity, the game does everything it sets out to do and remains a fun family diversion throughout\".\n"}

It is Allen's 44th film. The film stars Emma Stone, Colin Firth, Hamish Linklater, Marcia Gay Harden, Jacki Weaver, Erica Leerhsen, Eileen Atkins, and Simon McBurney. Set in the 1920s on the French Riviera, the film was released on July 25, 2014, by Sony Pictures Classics. \"Magic in the Moonlight\" received a generally mixed reception. Critics praised the performances of Firth and Stone, but found its writing formulaic.\n\nIn 1928, a globally famous illusionist, Wei Ling Soo, performs in front of a crowd in Berlin with his world-class magic act. As he walks off stage the film audience sees that he is actually a British man named Stanley (Colin Firth). He berates his employees and is generally curmudgeonly towards his well-wishers. In his dressing-room, he is greeted by old friend and fellow illusionist Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney). Howard enlists Stanley to go with him to the Côte d'Azur where a rich American family, the Catledges, has apparently been taken in by a clairvoyant and mystic, Sophie (Emma Stone). In fact, the son of the family, Brice (Hamish Linklater), is smitten with Sophie, and his sister Caroline (Erica Leerhsen) and brother-in-law George (Jeremy Shamos) are concerned Brice is considering proposing marriage. Howard says that he has been unable to uncover the secrets behind her tricks and he admits that the more he watched her the more he believed she really has supernatural powers. So he would like Stanley, who has debunked charlatan mystics in the past, to help him prove she is a fraud.\n\nHoward and Stanley travel to the French Riviera, but Stanley is soon astonished by Sophie's ability to go into a fugue state and apparently pull out highly personal details about him and his family. Stanley witnesses a seance in which Sophie communicates with the deceased patriarch of the American family. A candle floats up from the table and Howard grabs it to try to discern what trickery is at play, but is astounded to find no apparent subterfuge. Stanley begins spending time with Sophie. He takes her to visit his aunt and they drive a convertible along the picturesque rocky corniches.\n\nWhen Stanley and Sophie visit his aunt Vanessa (Eileen Atkins), Sophie is seemingly able, after holding aunt Vanessa's pearls, to somehow relate secret details of Vanessa's one great love affair. This finally convinces Stanley of Sophie's authenticity and he has an emotional epiphany, feeling that his lifelong rationalism and cynicism have been misguided. When caught in a rain storm, they end up at an observatory that Stanley had visited as a child. After the rain subsides, they open the roof up and view the stars.\n\nAt a Gatsby-esque party, Stanley and Sophie dance. As they walk together later that night, Sophie asks him if he has felt any feelings for her \"as a woman\". Stanley, who has admired her talents as a mystic and is grateful to her for opening his eyes to a new worldview, is taken aback and admits that he has not thought of her that way. She leaves upset. The next day Stanley holds a press conference to tell the world that he, who spent his life debunking charlatan mystics, has finally come to find one who is the real deal. The reporters drill him with questions, but the grilling is interrupted when he receives news his aunt Vanessa has been in a car accident.\n\nStanley rushes to the hospital, and in an emotional scene in a waiting room considers turning to prayer for solace. That is, if he now has come to believe in divination and mysticism, perhaps he should believe in God and prayer. He begins to pray for a miracle to save his aunt, but is unable to go through with it. The rationality that has been his whole life comes back and he rejects prayer, the supernatural and by extension, Sophie and her powers. He decides once more to prove she is a fraud.\n\nUsing a trick seen earlier in his stage act, Stanley appears to leave the room but stays to overhear Sophie and Howard discuss their collusion in what has been an elaborate ruse. He discovers that Sophie was able to know so much about him and his aunt because she and Howard collaborated to fool Stanley. Sophie was indeed a charlatan tricking the rich American family and was quickly discovered by Howard. Rather than unmask her and stop the ruse, he enlisted Sophie to help him one-up his best friend and rival, Stanley.\n\nStanley is initially angry at Howard and Sophie but decides to forgive them. In a conversation with his aunt Vanessa, who has recovered from her car accident, Stanley admits and fully realizes that he is in love with Sophie. He finds her and asks her not to marry Brice, but marry him instead. Sophie is taken aback and finds his haughty, awkward proposal unsuitable. She tells him she still plans to marry the wealthy Brice. Returning dejected to his aunt Vanessa's, Stanley further admits that he fell in love with Sophie at first sight, and, saddened, is then surprised when Sophie, who had arrived before him, knocks a spirit knock. He proposes, she accepts with a spirit knock, and they kiss as the film ends.\n\n\nIn April 2013, Colin Firth and Emma Stone joined the cast of the film.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 52%, based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10.

Jordan Hoffman of Film.com also enjoyed the film, stating, \"This picture isn’t as showy or obvious as one of his (many) masterpieces, but it is quite good and deserves your time and respect.\" In \"The New Yorker\", David Denby agreed that Colin Firth \"carries [the film] through.\" In \"The Wall Street Journal\", Joe Morgenstern complimented Emma Stone and concluded, \"Think of it as a 97-minute séance that draws you in, spins you around, subverts your suppositions, levitates your spirits and leaves you giddy with delight\"\n\nHowever, in \"Vanity Fair\", Richard Lawson criticized Emma Stone's acting, arguing, \"her line delivery is too modern to really work convincingly in the period, and like many other nonetheless talented actors, she has trouble with Allen’s stilted, formal cadence.\" He added that the age gap between Stone and Firth was \"a little gross\" and \"icky\". Alan Scherstuhl of the \"Village Voice\" disliked the film, criticizing its familiarity to Allen's previous work and believing the writing was uninspired. Chris Nashawaty of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the movie a \"B-\" grade (from A+ to F), remarking that it was funny and \"pleasant\" but also forgettable.

Rarely, though, has he put a story on screen that manifests so little energy, so little curiosity about its own ideas and situations.\"\n\nIn 2016 film critics Robbie Collin and Tim Robey ranked it as one of the worst movies by Woody Allen.\n\nThe film opened in limited release in North America on July 25, 2014.

As its name implies, the magician uses sleight of hand to manipulate a number of billiard balls (the balls are often smaller than actual billiard balls), giving the impression that he is making them appear and vanish at his command.\n\nIn this presentation, the magician will hold a single ball in his hand. The ball suddenly becomes two balls, in plain view of the audience. He then proceeds to produce a third and fourth ball, all in the same hand. The magician will then vanish the balls, one at a time, until only one remains. Often, part of the routine involves the magician giving the impression that he is \"passing\" the balls through his body, in and out of his mouth, fingertips, and pockets.\n\nSets of multiplying billiard balls are available from magicians' supply stores. The quality, size, material, and price of the balls can vary greatly and are dependent on the magician's personal taste. The balls are most frequently made of wood, plastic, or metal.\n\nFrom an article by Tom Stone in the Swedish magazine \"Trollkarlen\" (No 152 - 2003):\n\n"}

They practice and often perform in huge square-compounds (\"quadras de samba\") devoted to practising and exhibiting samba, an African-Brazilian dance. The schools (which are structured more like a guild than a school in the usual sense) have a strong community basis and are traditionally associated with a particular neighborhood. They are often seen to affirm the cultural validity of the Afro-Brazilian heritage in contrast to the mainstream education system. and have evolved often in contrast to authoritarian development. The phrase \"escola de samba\" is popularly held to derive from the schoolyard location of the first group's early rehearsals. In Rio de Janeiro especially, they are mostly associated with particular shanty towns (\"favela\"). Samba and the samba school can be deeply interwoven with the daily lives of the shanty-town dwellers. Throughout the year the samba schools have various happenings and events, most important of which are rehearsals for the main event which is the yearly carnival parade. Each of the main schools spend many months each year designing the theme, holding a competition for their song, building the floats and rehearsing. It is overseen by a \"carnavalesco\" or carnival director. From 2005, some fourteen of the top samba schools in Rio have used a specially designed warehouse complex, the size of ten football pitches, called Samba City (Cidade do Samba) to build and house the elaborate floats. Each school's parade may consist of about 3,000 performers or more, and the preparations, especially producing the many different costumes, provide work for thousands of the poorest in Brazilian society. The resulting competition is a major economic and media event, with tens of thousands in the live audience and screened live to millions across South America.\n\nThe formal parades (\"desfiles\") during carnival, are a showcase of each main \"escola\" enhanced by the participation of celebrities, fans and guests who often pay large sums of money for their elaborate costumes. In Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Porto Alegre, the formal parades are held in specially constructed arenas called Sambadromes (Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí in Rio, the Anhembi Sambadrome in São Paulo) designed by influential architect, Oscar Niemeyer, the Sambadromo Complexo Cultural Porto Seco in Porto Alegre and the Sambadromo de Uruguaiana in Uruguaiana where participates \"escolas de samba\" from Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. Sambadromes are designed to accommodate all social classes, with VIP lounges, tourist sections, and various types of seating right down to cheapest seats for poorest sections of the community. Those who choose to only watch the parade may also be charged for the best seats. \n\nIn Uruguay, the major samba parades are in Artigas and in Montevideo. The Artigas Samba Parade and the Montevideo Samba Parade are the most importants in Uruguay.\n\nEach school displays glamour in colorful costumes and floats with special effects and is organized into different segments or \"alas\". The \"alas\" represent different components of the school's theme, or \"enredo\", as they act out a homage to a myth, historic event or figure, or express their view on a social, environmental or international issue. The \"alas\" display distinct costumes or \"fantasias\" and also reflect traditional samba school roles developed years ago. Thus, each samba school parade has the \"comissao de frente\"; individuals who open the parade by walking in social attires, saluting the crowds; the \"ala das Baianas\", or the traditional segment of Bahian African-Brazilian ladies with impressive round dresses spinning through the avenue; the \"puxadores\" (lead singers) singing the \"samba-enredo\" or theme-song while they play the \"cavaquinho\" or other string instruments; the \"velha guarda\", or veterans who made history in the school; the \"bateria\", or samba band with drums, \"cuicas\" and other instruments, preceded by the \"madrinha da bateria\", or band godmother who is often a sexy female celebrity. The \"porta-bandeira\", or the female flag holder, and the \"mestre-sala\", or male cortsy, display and salute the school's flag, as they dance and strive to show harmony and samba expertise, as their performance is carefully observed and scored by the judges.\n\n\"Cariocas\", the Rio natives, and \"Paulistanos\", São Paulo natives, are overtaken with emotion while performing or watching their favorite school, much more so in Rio, where a carnival samba school culture has been developed since the 1930s and samba rehearsals, costume making, and planning is a year-round event. It is often said that a samba school slum dweller may not have a job or food on the table the whole year, but they will make sure they have the money for their costume to show their \"samba no pe'\" or dancing skills expertise.\nAs samba schools originated in Rio de Janeiro, they are today the most famous ones and, arguably, produce the most spectacular parades or (as it is often said) the \"greatest show on Earth\". The city of São Paulo also has a number of samba schools with some tradition that is linked to an interesting mixture of African-Brazilian display of pride, immigrant or working class activism, and soccer team fondness, as schools such as \"Gavioes da Fiel\", \"Mancha Verde\" began as a singing/dancing group that cheered and rooted during matches in São Paulo stadiums. Nearly all Brazilian states have samba schools, but states such as Bahia and Pernambuco tend to have floats that lead a crowd composed of general people, without the need for membership, rehearsals or even a special attire. Some groups do charge a certain amount of money for the \"abadás\", or colorful T-shirts that display affiliation to a specific group, or \"bloco\".\n\nA significant majority of the samba schools, mainly in Rio de Janeiro, have in their name the words \"Grêmio Recreativo Escola de Samba\" (Recreative Guild Samba School), represented by the acronym GRES, before the name itself. In São Paulo there is a common variation \"Grêmio Recreativo Cultural e Escola de Samba\" (Recreative Cultural Guild and Samba School). There are exceptions, such as the \"Sociedade Rosas de Ouro\" (Golden Rose Society) and the traditional \"Agremiação Recreativa Cultural e Escola de Samba Vizinha Faladeira\" (\"grêmio\" and \"agremiação\" in Portuguese are synonyms). The standardization of the classifications of entities emerged in 1935 when the Rio carnival associations were required to take a charter to the \"Delegacia de Costumes e Diversões\" (Delegation of Customs and Entertainment) to be able to parade. In an effort to show a modicum of decency and organization, the delegate owner, Dulcídio Gonçalves, refused to grant the permit to associations with \"inappropriate\" names, which is why the GRES Portela had to change to the current name, instead of the previous \"Vai Como Pode\" (Come as You Will).\n\nThe samba school system seems to be unique to Brazil. Unlike parades such as the Rose Parade in California, for instance, the samba schools' organizations consist almost entirely of community volunteer work. More than just musical groups, the schools are the neighborhood associations that cover a variety of community needs, such as educational resources and medical care. There are often political and commercial interests involved as well, even from abroad, especially when the samba school honors the literature, music and dance, or a myth, historic figure or event from another country. Drug lords who control trafficking in the Rio favelas as well as illicit gambling (Jogo do Bicho) are also said to contribute financially to schools, as many of them are guardians and controllers of shanty town life.\n\nThe origins of samba schools are linked to the history of carnival in Rio itself, as well as the creation of the modern samba. The first parades, or \"cortumes\", as Luso-Brazilians called them, were more exclusive events and used to have white revelers, rather than mostly African-Brazilians like nowadays. The rhythms were often the \"marchinhas\", with a more Portuguese or European flair. Samba players from a group called Estácio were the pioneers of present-day samba schools, with the founding of \"Deixa Falar\", or Let Me Speak in 1928. Ismael Silva seems to have been the first to have come up with idea of creating \"blocos de Carnaval\" in which groups could dance and move to the samba rhythms and sounds.\n\nThe first samba school contests began in 1928 and were held at the home of Zé Espinguela, where his Conjunto Oswaldo Cruz won and Mangueira and Deixa Falar also competed for the title. Some consider this as the starting point leading to the development of present-day samba schools.\n\nHowever, between 1930 and 1932, these were only considered a variation of the \"blocos\", local street parade celebration, and in 1932 the owner of Mundo Sportivo, Mário Filho, decided to sponsor the first Parade of Samba Schools in Praça Onze. Composers such as Antônio Nassar, Armando Reis and Orestes Barbosa) had the idea of organizing a Carnival parade which was supported by local newspapers. Newspaper owners and journalists such as Mário Filho and his brother Nélson Rodrigues, who did not have much to write about after the end of the soccer season, joined journalist Carlos Pimentel, who was connected to samba personalities in holding a parade at Praca XI square.\n\nAt the invitation of \"Sports World\", 19 schools attended. The newspaper established the criteria for judging the participating schools and nowadays news networks still have some say on the parades as they strive for fairness and high quality, especially because so much money is invested on TV networks that have broadcasting rights for the parades. Newspapers and magazines also make huge profitsl. The traditional \"ala das Baianas\" was a prerequisite to compete, and the schools, all with more than one hundred members, should present sambas unpublished and not use pipe instruments, among other requirements.\n\nThe winning school was Mangueira, while the second group had the \"Conjunto Osvaldo Cruz\", or Portela. The officials assured the success of the contest remained up in Praca XI Square in 1941. Over time, the samba schools took many elements brought by ranches, such as the plot, the pair of mestre-sala cortsy and flag holder and the opening committee, elements with which Ismael Silva disagreed.\nWith the rise of populist dictator Getúlio Vargas and the foundation of the General Union of Samba Schools in 1934, the marginalization of samba persisted for some time. Then, it regained power and began to expand and gain importance in the Rio carnival, supplanting the ranches carnival. It did not take long for the samba schools to expand to other states, with the foundation in 1935 of the \"Primeira São Paulo\" (First of São Paulo), the first school of samba de São Paulo. The official competitions of the samba schools in São Paulo only started in 1950 with the victory of Lavapés, but before that there were other minor tournaments at the municipal and state levels. In the early 1960s some organized soccer support fan groups, like the Vai-Vai (Go-Go) and the Camisa Verde e Branco (Green and White Jersey) became samba schools.\n\nDue to the large number of schools, in 1952, the access league \"Grupo de Acesso\" was created in order to allow news schools in and promote them to the \"premier league\" only if they aboded by certain rules of excellence. That year, the parade of the access league (Group 2, current Group RJ-1) went seamlessly, but the parade of the main group (Group 1, currently the Special Group) was carried out under heavy rain. The judging results were canceled and all schools belonging to the access league were promoted to the \"premier league\".\n\nIn 1953 UGESB and FBES in AESCRJ, merged as LIESA, an association of samba schools from the premier league which became known in Portuguese as Grupo Especial. In 2008, LESGA was created, representing schools from the access league. LIESA inspired the creation of similar bodies in other cities, such as LIGA-SP.\n\nIn 1984, Rio de Janeiro governor Leonel Brizola dedicated the Sambadrome, a special space for the parading of samba schools. Years later, in São Paulo, Mayor Luiza Erundina did the same, creating the Anhembi Sambadrome.\n\nToday, many other cities throughout the country also have their Sambadromes, including Manaus and in 1993 its parade was broadcast for the first time.\n\nNatural associations are almost always local, largely from poor communities or the suburbs, forming samba schools that usually represent in a district, sub-district or set of districts. A parade which usually has local character, whereas the main schools of the city gather to compete among themselves for the best of the year. In this show, conducted over two nights, they are evaluated by a committee of judges chosen in advance by their leaders or by the representative.\n\nThe judges consider each of the judging categories, giving points to each. On the day that the results are announced, the final assessment of the panel can be affected by certain penalties for breaking certain rules, such as the requirement to parade within specific time limits, parading with the minimum components, and avoiding total nudity.\n\nIn major cities, the parade of each samba school currently takes about an hour, with some variations according to the rules imposed by the organization of the carnival in the city. For each of the Special Group in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the parade has a maximum time of one hour and twenty minutes, while in São Paulo is the maximum of 1 hour and five minutes. Along the parade ground, stop watches mark the period of time.\n\nThis is the time and place occupied by the schools while waiting their turn to enter the parade in the Sambadrome.\n\nAfter the end of a parade, the narrator announces the school next to perform, and the sounds from the microphone, restricted to only a part of sambadrome, are released so that people can hear in the bleachers. Then the opening cries are heard, after which the parade itself begins, and the timer starts to run.\n\nSeveral elements are part of the characterization of a parade of the samba school, and some areas to which the jury should assign notes. Others, like the wing of Bahia, however, are not considered as items, but can cause loss of points for the body anyway, if not shown.\n\nThis is the first group of parade participants to perform, and consists of about ten to fifteen people who execute a choreography to introduce the theme. Apart from the Front Commission, there is no other rule regarding the order of the elements during the parade of samba schools.\n\nFunctioning as a sort of master of ceremonies of the show by welcoming the public and presenting the school, the front commission of the samba schools has undergone many changes over time. In its early years, it was formed by a group of men, the general directors of the college, who came in front of the school wearing their best clothes and welcomed the public. Sometimes they carried sticks in their hands, whose prime objective was \"to defend the group against rivals\".\n\nThe Portela samba school developed a more refined front commission, where its performers paraded with elegant clothes, even occasionally with tails and top hat, a model which soon came to be copied by other schools. That was the policy of its most illustrious member, Paulo da Portela, which meant that Sambistas should always go well dressed, in order to dispel the negative image of them held by the upper class. In the less formal blocos, predecessors of the schools, they had a reputation of being supporters of street fights and street riot.\n\nOne of the judging categories is the allegorical floats, filled with sculptures of wood, plastic, Styrofoam and other materials, decorated to represent the elements of the plot. In the Special Group performance of Rio de Janeiro, floats currently may not exceed eight meters and fifty centimeters wide and nine meters and eighty centimeters tall.\n\nThe first float of the parade often includes a stylised depiction of the school. Some schools, such as Portela for example, always bring their winged eagle symbol, regardless of plot. The greatest floats can reach up to 13 meters high and 60 meters in length, which sometimes affects their entry into the parade ground. These floats are propelled by hand with people who are below or behind the float. No float can be moved by an engine (during the 1990s, it was to prevent the risk of fire.\n\nThe progression or evolution of the school's parade as it develops its story is of great importance to the judges. Anyone watching should have the impression that the school is a single body, a continuous row. There is no requirement that the components perform samba, but they must move with a degree of unison and good timing. Schools that suffer dramatic changes in its parade speed, parading sometimes very quickly, sometimes slowly, are usually penalized.\n\nSchools where the participants do not sing the samba, or sing badly, may receiving lower points.\n\nAs a feature of the parades, the plot, usually chosen some time after the previous carnival, will occupy the school for the following year. Meanwhile, from the main theme, a synopsis is drawn, which will guide the design and manufacture of costumes, floats and samba-song. Judges will decide whether the school explained the theme during the parade.\n\nJudges assess whether the samba has a good melody and lyrics with interesting features, musically rich, reflecting the theme, and without bias or errors of language. The samba of each school is chosen after an internal competition at the school, where Sambistas or groups create their sambas, based on the previously agreed theme. The competition takes place over several weekends, some entries are eliminated, until only there is a winning song which the school then adopts. In Rio de Janeiro, the competition usually takes place in August. In October, a CD of the Special Group is recorded with chosen sambas from each school\n\nUntil 2007, the Special Group schools of São Paulo, the samba song would be considered twice, once for lyrics and once for melody of music, with equal points for each.\n\nThe mestre-sala (literally, \"The Master of the Room\") and porta-bandeira (\"she who carries the flag\") display the flag of the school to the audience. The porta-bandeira carries the flag, and the mestre-sala pays tribute and draws attention to both the flag and the porta-bandeira. Her dance is not a samba, but she spins and swirls her way ahead. The mestre-sala dances around her. All their moves are regulated in a set of rules, and at one point during the parade they are evaluated by the judges. The slightest mistake may result in their scores being lowered. For example: it is forbidden that the two turn their backs to each other at the same time, and errors such as the drop of a hat or other slips will result in lower scores. Their costumes are similar to the gala costumes typical of the eighteenth century, but \"carnavalized\", i.e. with an exaggerated amount of colors and decorations.\n\nCurrently, at least since the 1990s, the schools of the Special Group of Rio and São Paulo parade usually with three or four pairs of mestre-salas and porta-bandeira, but only the first is evaluated, the other being merely decorative, and optional. Normally, they are there to represent the school in some events when the main couple is unable to.\n\nThe \"mestre-sala\" seems to reflect the carnival dances of the nineteenth century, in which there was a professional organization responsible for the hall that was called \"master of room\" or \"master-room.\" With respect to the porta-bandeira, the name was a natural adaptation of the old flag-bearer character, usually male, who carried the heavy banners of Brazilian carnival groups The visual aspect of the mestre-sala has also been compared to the Zé Pilintra of ethnic Afro-Brazilian traditions.\n\nThe drumming wing, or \"bateria\", is a kind of orchestra of percussion instruments. They accompany the singer and lead the pace of the parade. The faster and stronger the pace of the bateria, the faster members usually parade. Each school has, currently, an average 250 to 300 musicians. Every bateria is evaluated on \"the regular maintenance and support of the cadence ... in accordance with the Samba Theme: the perfect combination of sounds emitted by various tools, and the creativity and versatility of the bateria.\"\n\nThe following instruments usually form part of a bateria of the samba school: Surdo de primera, surdo de segunda, surdo de terceira, caixa de guerra, repinique, chocalho, tambourim, cuíca, agogô, reco-reco, and frigedeira. There are variations in composition, for example, the samba-school Mangueira, does not use the surdo de segunda, only surdo de primeira and terceira, while the samba-school Empire Serrano emphasizes the agogô.\n\nIn the 1960s came the \"Paradinha\" (\"little stop\") of Mestre André, a famous director of the Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel. André was the creator of the musical effect in which the bateria suddenly stop playing during a parade, leaving only the cavaquinho (a small string instrument) and voice components for a moment. When the music returns, the effect is of surprise and excitement. The expected effect, considered beautiful by the critics, is also risky because it increases the chances that the samba song can mistakenly be taken up again at the wrong moment.\n\nAs a whole orchestra, the percussionists of the samba school also has a conductor, also called master of bateria.\n\nThe queen of the drums section and related roles: godmother, muse, and princess are positions of honor occupied by distinguished members of the community and sometimes by celebrities. The queen of the drums section dances ahead of the drummers group and sometimes interacts with them.\n\nThe figure of the queen of the drums section appeared in the 1970s when the famous mulatto Adele Fatima led the Youth Independent Drums Section, an unprecedent fact, and gained popularity in the following decade. Today it is one of the most celebrated roles in samba schools. Monique Evans, in Mocidade, Luma de Oliveira, in Tradição and Soninha Capeta, in Beija-Flor, were some notable queens of drum sections. Some schools also introduced the figure of a King of the drums section.\n\nThe godmother of the drumming section is similar to the queen, and the two often get confused. Many schools use the two roles to pay tribute to more women. In the 1980s, many schools began to choose famous TV actresses instead of girls from the community, raising controversy in the media. In theory, the position of godmother should be offered to women of importance in the history of the school or in daily life, on a lifelong basis, which does not change every year, as the position of queen, but this is often not the case and the godmother only a queen with another name.\n\nThe \"ala das baianas\" is considered one of the most important wings of a samba school parade, and preferably composed of ladies dressed in clothes that refer to old aunts of the first groups of Bahia samba of the early twentieth century. It is mandatory for all competition parades of samba schools, although not official. In the years 1940 to 1950, it was common for men to parade dressed in this way.\n\nThe traditional clothing of Bahia consists of torso, coat, cloth and skirt round the coast. However, often we can see Bahia with the most unusual costumes, such as brides, statues of liberty, space beings, globe (pictured) or oil wells.\n\nThe old guard (in Portuguese \"Velha Guarda\") is a group of samba dancers older, often already quite old, often the founders of schools that no longer hold positions within the hierarchy of the party, but as a separate department, and occupy the Carnival parade in positions of honor, dressed in carnival costumes typical of samba, such zoot suits in school colors and Panama-style hats.\n\nThe singer, also known as the performer or puller is responsible for the professional performance of the samba-plot during the parade, and usually aided by a group of supporting singers. Using a microphone, and usually more powerful than the supporting singers, his voice stands out over the other members of the school, taking the lead on how fast the song is sung by the school's parade.\n\nThe samba during the parade should not be interpreted by one or just a few people, but sung by the entire school: the music should only be \"pulled\" (initiated) by the minority group. Moreover, many believe that the handle would be a special category of performer, able not only to interpret a samba, but also encourage and arouse the audience.\nFrom the 1990s, Jamelão, da Mangueira, has criticized the traditional term, seeking to replace it with a new terminology: Interpreter of samba-plot. In the words of Jamelão, one who would handle \"smoke pull, pull cart, pull-bag\" (in original \"puxa fuma fumo, puxa carro, puxa saco\"; in Rio de Janeiro's giria, \"smoke marijuana, steals veicule, yes-man\") which in his opinion, a derogatory term. From this, many commentators and TV stations began to replace the first by the second term, which however, still remains.\n\nAnother controversy that is still common for interpreters is the question whether or not it is unethical for the official interpreter at a school to participate in the internal dispute of their own college. Some schools prohibit this, but release their professionals to participate in tryouts for other schools.\n\nThis is the professional responsible for design and development of the plot to be submitted by a school of samba as well as the design, development and construction of floats and costumes related to the proposed plot. In some cases, the carnavalesco develops the plot from a topic proposed by the direction of the samba school. In others, he suggests the theme of an idea from its original. The carnavalesco is usually a single person, but the Beija-Flor school of Rio de Janeiro now use a team of carnavalescos. The carnavalescos may or may not be university-trained for the profession, and may even have a team of researchers working with them to develop the school's theme. Many have a strong carnaval connection or background in the visual arts, performing arts, theater or dance.\n\nThis is the name by which may be called the president, the president of honor and patron of the school. One can also use this to include carnival directors, producers and other crew members. A director of carnival is a director of the samba school that heads up the guidelines and philosophy of their carnival college, taking part in the selection of members of various sectors, even sometimes the plot, coordinating also the shed or warehouse where the floats are made, the purchase of equipment, payments and the development of the entire project of the school. It is not uncommon for directors of Carnival to be paid professionals. Many also include the executive directors of the samba school, such as Laíla, of Beija-Flor.\n\nThe results of the carnival competition are announced on the afternoon of Ash Wednesday in Rio, and on the afternoon of Tuesday of carnival in São Paulo. In both cities, there is a ceremony where long lines are set up in the Sambódromo site. Tents are set up where the representatives of each samba school will annotate the scores as they are being disseminated, making the calculations. The chairman of the league makes the final considerations about the carnival that year, reads the possible loss of points given to each samba school, and then reads the scores.\n\nThe bleachers are open to the public, and the charge for entry is typically one kilogram of non-perishable food. Both in Rio and in São Paulo the event is transmitted live on television; television cameras in real time are used to broadcast the movement of blocks within the main school, the title favorite, where members and fans that Sambódromo were not to gather to watch the event from there.\n\nThe scores typically range between 7 and 10 in Rio and São Paulo, and the points are further subdivided into decimal fractions in Rio and 25 hundredths in São Paulo. In Rio, all the marks given by all the jurors are valid, while in São Paulo the lowest note of each item is eliminated .\n\nThe scoring system has changed several times in both cities. In Rio and São Paulo, until the early 2000s, the division was more than half a point, and there have been years when there was also the elimination of major score given to each school, the very removal of the lower scores have also and has ceased to be part of the rule several times. In Rio de Janeiro, the lowest score in the same period was 5, and note the 0 (zero) allowed only in case of failure of the plot.\n\nOften the scores given by the jurors are questioned, both by fans, as by members of schools who are harmed, causing many complaints after the show. Some results have been controversial stop in court. In the case of the school of samba Acadêmicos de Santa Cruz that the dark parade carnival in 1991 because of a blackout and was not evaluated. However, in recent years in São Paulo has been the climate of acceptance of the outcome, when in 2007 the president of Tobias Go-Go Live congratulate the Youth Alegre, being greeted by members of the Lemon school the following year.\n\nStarted in the 1980s, the Parade of Champions is an event during which the top 5 schools of the Special Group and the winner of Group A repeat their parades in the Sambadrome. It takes place on the Saturday following Ash Wednesday. This parade has no competitive character; it is a celebratory festival to crown the year's best schools that gives the parade participants (AKA foliões) a chance to be more carefree and enjoy themselves.\n\nIn São Paulo, the parade of champions is the night between Friday night and after the carnival on Saturday. Already the parade in Rio is the night of Saturday to the early hours of Sunday. In Rio de Janeiro, until the 1990s, participated in the parade of champions also promoted the schools of the Group to access, something that remains in São Paulo. Tradition was considered also in the participation of society Rio carnival hundred Italian Carnevale D'Italia. In 1985, an event that is considered integral to the history of Nene de Vila Matilde, was when the school was invited to join the parade of champions Rio, in an era where the Carnival Paulistano was much less popular and have not had a proper space.\n\nNot always, however, the parade of champions was a moment of pure celebration: many schools have taken the day to protest against the outcome of the championship. Fifth-placed in 2005, the Vai-Vai had no parade that year. The Viradouro already the champions parade on Saturday with members using the clown nose and banners of protest.\n\n\n"}

Sivaji, with the help of his uncle Arivu, acquires evidence of 2 billion worth of illegal earnings in Adiseshan's possession and uses the documents to blackmail Adiseshan into giving him half the money. He further obtains details on people who have illegal earnings across Tamil Nadu and blackmails them to give him half of their illegal wealth. He then transfers the money to the bank accounts of his friends around the world by hawala forgery. They then deposit the money as donations to \"Sivaji Foundation\", making the money usable and legitimate.\n\nSivaji informs the Income Tax Investigation and Vigilance Department about the details of the illegal money held by the tax evaders (including Adiseshan) and gets them arrested. He reopens the foundation and soon is able to provide free, good quality education, infrastructure, services and employment to people in every district of Tamil Nadu. Led by Adiseshan, those who were blackmailed by Sivaji exploit Tamizhselvi's innocence to silence him. Fearing for Sivaji's life, she hands over Sivaji's laptop to the CBI and Income Tax officers hired by Adiseshan with all the information regarding the illegal money transactions. With presentable evidence, Sivaji is arrested.\n\nAdiseshan and the police order Sivaji to unlock his laptop. When Sivaji refuses, Adiseshan tortures him, leaving him for dead. To cover this up, Adiseshan and the police organise for thugs to shoot at the police van that will carry Sivaji's body, making it look like a murder by a third party. Sivaji, however, is faking; he was informed of the plans to kill him by a sympathetic police constable prior to the interrogation. Left alone in the room, he electrifies himself. Sivaji's friend Dr. Chezhian, Tamizhselvi and Arivu intercept the police van after being informed by Sivaji through a MMS and replace Sivaji's body with a dummy before the thugs open fire. While everyone thinks that Sivaji is dead, Chezhian revives him using a defibrillator. Following Sivaji's \"death\", Adiseshan and the CBI still try to open Sivaji's laptop by trying to fool the voice-detection program; they fail and all the data in the laptop is erased.\n\nA few days later, while everyone wonders about the future of \"Sivaji Foundation\", the revived Sivaji returns to take control of the foundation in the guise of an NRI friend, M. G. Ravichandran. Though Adiseshan immediately realises that Ravichandran is actually Sivaji, he is unable to prove this to the police due to the proof of Sivaji's \"death\" and Ravichandran's identity. Later, Sivaji confronts Adiseshan and the two fight atop the terrace of Adiseshan's medical college. During the fight, Adiseshan inadvertently strikes the campus's terrace roof causing money hidden in it to fly around the campus. The students spot the money and go after it, causing a stampede in which Adiseshan is killed. \"Sivaji Foundation\" soon becomes a frontier for India's economic and industrial rise.\n\nFollowing the success of his film \"Jeans\" (1998), S. Shankar wrote a script for his next film titled \"Mudhalvan\" (1999) having Rajinikanth in mind for the lead role. However, Rajinikanth could not act in the film due to schedule conflicts with \"Padayappa\" (1999). Hence the role went to Arjun Sarja. Post \"Anniyan\" (2005), Shankar decided to take a break before preparing for his next project.\n\nIn August 2005, Rajinikanth signed up for his next film which was to be produced by Chennai's oldest operative studio, AVM Productions, which was run by M. S. Guhan and M. Saravanan. This time Shankar was confirmed to be the film's director. After consulting Sivaji Ganesan's family to avoid any issues with the film's name, the project was subsequently announced on 24 August 2005. The film was titled \"Sivaji\", after Rajinikanth's name at birth – Sivaji Rao Gaekwad. A tagline, \"The Boss\", which stands for \"Bachelor of Social Service\", was suffixed to the title.\n\nIn addition to being AVM Productions' 168th film, \"Sivaji\" was also Rajinikanth's 154th film, his 100th Tamil film and his ninth film with AVM Productions. According to Rajinikanth's biographer Naman Ramachandran, the film was also made to commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of the production company's founder, A. V. Meiyappan. \"Sivaji\" was also noted for its change in the traditional yellow coloured Rajinikanth introductory text which made its debut with \"Annamalai\". Instead the text is displayed in Chrome.\n\nThe first choice for the role of the female lead was Aishwarya Rai. However, in October 2005, Shankar and Rajinikanth announced that actress Shriya Saran would play the female lead role. Saran's voice was dubbed by actress Kanika, who was selected after a successful voice test, thereby collaborating for the second time with Shankar. Actor Vivek was signed up for the role of Sivaji's maternal uncle, Arivu, in November 2005. Actress Sunaina made her acting debut through this film in a special appearance; the scene however was later removed from the final cut. Nayantara, who had earlier worked with Rajinikanth in \"Chandramukhi\", was signed up to perform alongside Rajinikanth in the song \"Baleilakka\".\n\nSuman was confirmed in March 2006 to play the role of Adiseshan after Amitabh Bachchan, Prakash Raj and Mohanlal were considered. Sathyaraj, who acted with Rajinikanth in \"Mr. Bharath\" (1986), said he declined the role because, \"After a film of the calibre of \"Mr. Bharath\" with Rajnikanth, I couldn't settle for anything less. So I didn't accept \"Sivaji\".\" For his role, Suman removed his moustache and used dentures to make his smile visible. Shankar instructed one of the costume designers to give the character a spotless white \"dhoti\", shirt, shoes, a Rolex watch and Ray-Ban sunglasses. Prior to this, Suman had acted with Rajinikanth in \"Thee\" (1981). Subbu Panchu Arunachalam, son of filmmaker Panchu Arunachalam, dubbed for Suman. Debate speakers Solomon Pappaiah and Pattimandram Raja were selected to play supporting roles, with the latter making his cinematic acting debut. Vadivukkarasi and Manivannan were selected to play Sivaji's parents. Raghuvaran appeared in a small role as Dr. Chezhian.\n\nShankar, who also wrote the film's story and screenplay, was paid a then record salary of 30 million (Indian rupees) for the project. A. R. Rahman, who was selected to compose the film's soundtrack and background score, was also paid 30 million. Sujatha Rangarajan was assigned to write the dialogues for \"Sivaji\". Tha. Prabhu Raja Cholan, who would later direct the film \"Karuppampatti\" (2013), worked as an assistant director in this film. Rajinikanth's daughter Soundarya worked as a graphics designer, creating the title for this film; she had earlier worked in the same position on two of her father's films – \"Baba\" (2002) and \"Chandramukhi\" (2005). K. V. Anand was hired as the cinematographer in August 2005. Manish Malhotra was responsible for designing the film's costumes, while Anthony and Thota Tharani were the editor and art director respectively. Additional make-up for Rajinikanth was done by make-up artist Banu.\n\nPrincipal photography commenced on 28 November 2005 with a puja at AVM Productions. The film's launch was a secret event, with only pivotal members of the cast and crew being called for the event's attendance. The first schedule of \"Sivaji\" began on 14 December 2005 with the song \"Vaaji Vaaji\" featuring Rajinikanth and Saran being shot at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. The idea of shooting at Ramoji Film City was suggested to Shankar by Tharani who felt that the place offered a lot of scope for him to utilise his skills and experience as an art director. \"Vaaji Vaaji\" was picturised with an intention to showcase a Babylonian palace setting when Shankar requested Tharani to show \"a palace with lots of colour\". Tharani created a four-storey Babylonian palace to accommodate 80 dancers and 100 junior artists for the number. Shooting of the number, which according to K. V. Anand was filmed in Super 35 motion picture film format, was completed in eight days. G. Dhananjayan mentions in his book \"The Best of Tamil Cinema\" that 35 million was spent on the song's making.\n\nTharani described the set designing for the song \"Sahana\", which was also shot at Ramoji Film City, as \"extremely challenging\". After listening to the lyrics of the song which speaks of the four traditional calendar seasons, Tharani thought of using a concept titled \"Living in Seasons\", which he used at a symposium held in Japan. For the set's design which depicted the four seasons, Tharani proposed three concepts – a traditional Japanese house, a contemporary house and a futuristic house. Shankar chose the futuristic house concept, which consisted of three domes in the shapes of a square, a circle and a pyramid adjacent to one another. The circular dome had a pathway around it and water falling from a 50 feet high rock, which would seep under the set. Tharani made use of acrylic glass and normal glass with the former being implemented on the floor to make the dance movements more easier to perform. Construction of the set for the number was completed in 30 days.\n\nIn addition to these two songs, Tharani contributed to similar creations for the music store where Tamizhselvi works as a saleswoman, the street surrounding the music store, the warehouse behind the music store, the interior portions of Thamizhselvi's house and Adiseshan's office room. The music shop was designed in the Victorian architecture style, while the warehouse was constructed at AVM Productions with the fight sequence being filmed there as well. Filming of another action sequence in an open-air theatre, which was also designed by Tharani, took place for approximately 15–20 days. K. V. Anand used balloon lights brought from a French company Airstar Space Lighting for the sequence. The interior portions of Thamizhselvi's house was designed using clippings of flats constructed by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board.\n\nThe \"Style\" segment was filmed in May 2006 at the Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, as well as the City of Arts and Sciences. The fair look of Rajinikanth's character in the segment was created using computer-generated imagery, which was performed by V. Srinivas Mohan, the head of the Chennai-based firm Indian Artists. K. V. Anand re-shot every single movement of Rajinikanth with a British woman named Jacky, who was also one of the song's background dancers. All the shots featuring Rajinikanth in the song and those featuring Jacky were scanned in 4K resolution to enhance their clarity after which Jacky's skin colour was digitally implemented onto Rajinikanth's skin. French hair-stylist Sandrin Veriar Seth designed two distinct hair-styles for the entire film and 13 hair-styles for the segment alone. To avoid disruptions that could occur at the shooting spot due to Rajinikanth's fan following in Tamil Nadu, Brinda choreographed \"Balleilakka\", Rajinikanth's introduction song sequence in Wai, a hill station near Pune with 500 people for eight days. To add more colour to the sequence, a 50-member team of Puli Kali artists from Thrissur were employed by Shankar as background dancers.\n\nIn November 2006, sequences featuring Rajinkanth, Saran and Vivek were shot at the Pune Junction railway station. Filming of a key portion involving Rajinikanth and Vivek took place in the Victoria Public Hall building in Chennai. A fight sequence and the song \"Athiradi\" were filmed at Binny Mills. The sets for the song were made bearing resemblance to the city of Venice. For the climax scenes, which were filmed at the Magarpatta city SEZ towers, Rajinikanth tonsured his head. The scenes where Sivaji gets the money he transferred to his friends by forgery were filmed in New York City. The completion of those scenes in February 2007 marked the end of the principal photography. The climactic fight between Sivaji and Adiseshan was filmed at Vels University. K. V. Anand told Shobha Warrier of Rediff that the portions other than the songs and action sequences were completed in 65 days. For the film's dubbed Telugu version, Rajinikanth reshot some scenes.\n\nMany critics stated that the theme of \"Sivaji\" has been inspired from Shankar's previous films \"Gentleman\" (1993) and \"Mudhalvan\" (1999). The film deals with the concept of corruption and money laundering and how the film's protagonist employs methods to get rid of those elements. Gopinath Rajendran of \"The New Indian Express\" compared the film's title character to Robin Hood for being a hero \"who takes from the rich and passes it on to the poor\".\n\nSivaji, who is a software engineer is frustrated with the corruption in India which is shown in the scene where he watches the pitiable condition of poor people stating that: \"The rich get richer, the poor get poorer\". Sivaji's love for his country is also illustrated in a scene where he is advised by his uncle to go back to abroad but he says \"Where else will I go? This is home.\"\n\nAfter some re-recording of the background score in Paraguay, A.R. Rahman had been to London for additional re-recording.\n\nA month and a half prior to the film's official soundtrack release, three songs from the soundtrack were leaked into the Internet. The songs, however, were only unofficial with low quality, where the official versions were composed slightly different and sung by different artists.\n\nThe television rights of the film were sold to Kalaignar TV for 40 million. The film's distribution rights, as distributed by AVM Productions to various companies are for the selling of rights to Kerala, for Andhra Pradesh and for the rights to Ayngaran, an international Tamil film distributor. The trailer was released by CNN-IBN on 30 May 2007 lasting for three minutes. The official trailer was released by AVM to \"Galatta.com\", the official online sponsor and Ayngaran International. The film was supposed to be released on the Tamil New Year's day, 14 April 2007, but due to post-production delays, the film was released worldwide on 15 June 2007. On 15 July 2007, AVM Productions, the producers of the film, announced their decision to dub the film into Hindi. That version was released on 14 January 2010.\n\nM. Satyamoorthy, on 9 July 2007, sought to stop the film being screened, claiming that it defamed the Indian National Congress, a political party, as well as its president, Sonia Gandhi, and the then Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh. Satyamoorthy cited a scene in which portraits of Gandhi and Singh are visible behind Adiseshan's chair, implying that Adiseshan was a member of the Indian National Congress. Satyamoorthy also claimed in damages from the film's producer, director and lead actor to be paid to the Tamil Nadu section of the party. Jaya Rajadevan, one of the film's assistant directors, sought an injunction in civil court to stop screening of the film for alleged plagiarism. Rajadevan claimed that he had written the film's story and had discussed it with Shankar's manager in 2005. Although the court sent notices to Shankar, among others, the screening of the film was not stopped.\n\nRajinikanth used his political affiliations to screen the film for several politicians. He went to Hyderabad to showcase the film for the former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister, Chandrababu Naidu, on 14 June 2007. At the screening, Rajinikanth told the media that he would invite the Chief Minister, Rajasekhara Reddy, for a special viewing as well. Rajinikanth said that he had screened the film to current and former Tamil Nadu Chief Ministers, Dr. Karunanidhi and Jayalalitha, respectively, and that India's Finance Minister, P Chidambaram, was also keen to watch the film. A private screening was also shown to Amitabh Bachchan.\n\nA 2012 re-release, also known as \"Sivaji 3D,\" was created by re-mastering the original to Dolby Atmos and post-converting to 3D format and cutting half an hour of running time. \"Sivaji 3D\" is the first Indian film to be launched with the new Dolby Atmos platform. The trailer of 3D version was launched on 13 August 2012 at Prasad Labs along with Rajinikanth. The 3D version released on 12 December 2012, coinciding with Rajinikanth's birthday. The runtime of 3D version was shorter than original, cut to two hours and thirty-five minutes.\n\nThe theatrical rights of the film were sold for in Kerala and in Andhra Pradesh. Worldwide, the film was estimated to have been released in about 750 screens. The film opened to virtually full cinemas. \"Sivaji\" was released in 303 screens in Tamil Nadu, 300 screens in Andhra Pradesh; 12 screens in North India and 145 screens across the rest of the world. It was released in 16 screens in Chennai and grossed within the first four days, at that point a new record for Tamil cinema. The film also debuted well in Kerala and in Bangalore. Despite protests from pro-Kannada groups, the film debuted in 13 screens. In the national capital, New Delhi, the film debuted on 4 screens in PVR Cinemas. Based on what the distributors claim, there was \"overwhelming response to the film\", with the number of screens increasing to 12 by the second week. The film made a good debut in the nation's other metros as well such as Mumbai and Kolkata, as well as in other non-traditional markets for Tamil films such as Pune and Baroda. The film grossed 40.7 million in two weeks; 85 million in five weeks, and 100 million in seven weeks in Chennai.\n\n\"Sivaji\" was also successful in international markets. The film had a wide release with over 145 prints and in 200 theatres (Tamil Version alone) in over 20 countries across South East Asia, Europe, North America, GCC and Australia and others, one of the widest release for an Indian film in the international markets. Internationally, \"Sivaji\" had good screenings in Malaysia. grossing over US$2 million in Malaysia, \"Sivaji\" made a debut with 150 shows in Singapore. In Sri Lanka, the film debuted across 70 screens with all 700 shows virtually sold out. In the Persian Gulf that contains a sizeably large Indian diaspora, the film opened to a good response. The film has collected over $8.5 Million from the overseas markets.\n\nIn Canada, the film released in 10 screens in 3 major cities along with special screenings for the Tamil diaspora in the smaller cities. In United Kingdom, the film debuted on the box-office list at No.9 with earnings of about £14,000 per screen and was the first Tamil film to enter UK Top 10. In United States, \"Sivaji\" was released in 24 screens with subsequent additions of 19 and 21 screens for the Tamil version and Telugu version respectively. The producers of the film claimed that the film was going to be dubbed in Chinese and Japanese by Ayngaran International, the holder of international rights of the film. The response in Cape Town was disappointing, while the box-office collections in Johannesburg and Durban allowed it to become the first Tamil film to feature in the South African box-office top 10. Singapore Airlines bought a 3-month exclusive in-flight screening rights to the film, a first for the airline for any Tamil film.\n\nIn the UK, 13 seconds of the film was cut. The original film showed Rajinikanth throwing a firecracker into his mouth, lighting it and then spitting it out at Pattimanram Raja, which was removed to give the film a 12A rating, The Ayngaran UK DVD release was uncut and given an 18 rating by the BBFC. It was also the first Tamil film to be officially released on a 1080p High Definition Blu-ray disc.\n\nThe overseas distributor Ayngaran International reported collections as follows: US$2,000,000, Canada $500,000, UK$750,000, Europe and Gulf $750,000, Malaysia $2,000,000, Singapore $750,000, Sri Lanka $1,250,000, Australia, New Zealand & Thailand $250,000. \"Sivaji\" was released in South Africa in late July 2007 after six weeks of its release by the leading South African distributor Ster Kinekor with four prints and released in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban.\n\nMalathi Rangarajan of \"The Hindu\", in a review about the story, said that the lead character carrying out a rebellion against corruption was something \"not be true to life\". She concluded by saying that \"the story sags towards the end\". She, however, appreciated the performances of the prominent actors, the soundtrack, art direction, photography and the animation. Ananth Krishnan, another review from \"The Hindu\", a month after the film's release, said that the film \"... presents an effective diagnosis of entrenched corruption but the rather disturbing remedy it offers is, good old vigilantism.\" It concluded by saying that, though the film did well at the box-office, the message of rejecting the corrupt system instead of reforming it was troubling. T. S. V. Hari of \"Hindustan Times\" said that the director, Shankar, was not creative enough for the film and added this by saying \"\"Sivaji\" turns out to be a rehash of all his previous jingoistic claptrap efforts\". It appreciated the other technical departments and suggested a good response at the box office. \"The Times of India\" had a similar review about the story saying that \"it had nothing new to offer\" but promised it to be entertaining and gave it four stars.\n\nR G Vijayasarathy of Rediff.com summed the film by saying, \"No logic, only Rajni's magic\". About the story, he said, \"Unfortunately, (the) message is lost in the maze of illogical and sometimes absurd sequences\". The review, however, praised the performances of Rajinikanth, Shriya and Vivek and the technical crew. Sify wrote: \"There is only one hero here, [..] – Rajni himself. Such is the overpowering screen presence of his cinematic charisma in every frame of the film. The film works big time as Shankar has made the film on a grand scale, [..] which is a visual treat with superbly choreographed action scenes. All this comes with top-of-the line techno-finesse, perhaps the best ever in Tamil cinema\" and also wrote that \"Technically, [..] a revelation [..] there are stunning visuals, which is paisa vasool. K.V.Anand's cinematography is top class. Art director Thotta Tharani work is enticing, especially the sets in songs\".\n\n\n\n\n2007 Tamil Nadu State Film Awards \n\n\n"}
{"id": "20853741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20853741", "title": "Star singers", "text": "Star singers\n\nStar singers also known as Epiphany singers, or Star boys' singing procession (England), are children and young people walking from house to house with a star on a rod and often wearing crowns and dressed in clothes to resemble the Three Magi (variously also known as Three Kings or Three Wise Man). The singing processions have their roots in an old medieval ecclesiastical play, centred on the Biblical Magi of the Christmas story in the Gospel of Matthew (Mt 2,1-28), appropriate to Epiphany. It is observed usually during the period between 27 December and 6 January (the feast of the Epiphany).\n\nIn Scandinavia and Central Europe a special set of songs, distinct from Christmas carols has developed in this context. In England, the liturgical drama developed from being performed by cathedral schoolboys in the 16th century to become a more secular mystery drama, containing also some ordinary Christmas songs and carols. Historically performed by boys and male adolescents only, it is nowadays performed by children and young people of both sexes in most regions where the tradition is alive.\nAt a synod in Konstanz in Germany at Christmas in 1417 the British clergies performed the Star boy drama for the rest of the participants at the meeting. They wore expensive costumes and had a large shining star. The performance was a huge success at the church conference and could have been one of the main reasons for growing popularity of the drama in post-medieval Europe.\n\nThe importance of the Twelfth Day and the feast of the Epiphany grew with the introduction of the Gregorian calendar as the day, according to the earlier Julian calendar, is also the Old Christmas Day.\n\nAfter the Reformation in the 16th century, pupils of the cathedral schools in Protestant nations conducted these processions to raise funds to replace the church support that had disappeared. The custom passed further on to the general populace as a kind of narrative folk drama, but seems to have declined in its original form since the late 19th century.\n\nSince then the singing procession has become common in many parts of Europe (both in Catholic and Protestant areas) and in Russia. In most countries it is no longer restricted to boys, but children or both sexes participate. In Germany, Austria and Belgium organisations centrally organise the processions, collecting money for charity or international aid projects, leading to a widespread support of the custom.\n\nIn Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria the Epiphany singing is performed at or close to Epiphany (January 6) and has developed into a nationwide custom, where the children of both sexes call on every door and are given sweets and money for charity projects - mostly in aid of poorer children in other countries.\n\nA tradition in most of Central Europe involves writing a blessing above the main door of the home. For instance if the year is 2014, it would be \"20 * C + M + B + 14\". The initials refer to the Latin phrase \"Christus mansionem benedicat\" (= May Christ bless this house); folkloristically the letters are often interpreted as the names of the Three Wise Men (Caspar, Melchior, Balthasar). In Catholic parts of Germany and in Austria, this is done by the \"Sternsinger\" (literally \"Star singers\"). After having sung their songs, recited a poem, and collected donations for children in poorer parts of the world, they will chalk the blessing on the top of the door frame or place a sticker with the blessing.\n\nAnnually around 300 000 people are active in collecting donations in Germany.\n\nIn Austria the biggest carol singing campaign is organized by the \"DKA\" (Dreikönigsaktion), an aid foundation founded by the youth organization Katholische Jungschar. Annually about 85,000 children and 30,000 adults take part in the \"Dreikönigsaktion\".\n\nThe biggest carol singing campaign in Slovakia is Dobrá Novina (English: \"Good News\"). It is also one of the biggest charity campaigns by young people in the country. Dobrá Novina is organized by the youth organization eRko.\n\nThe Star singers, aged about ten to fifteen, are dressed in long white shirts and pointed brown or white paper hats, in imitation of a well-known picture of the Biblical Magi as Babylonians Balthazar carries the star and Caspar and Melchior are armed with wooden swords. The other characters usually do not disguise themselves but also dress in long shirts, often in brown, green or grey colours and conical hats. Joseph has got a cylindrical paper hat and a wooden timber or broad axe. King Herod wears a crown and he and his soldiers carry wooden swords. In the crowd there may also be shepherds with long shirts and sticks and some angels with white shirts and wings.\n\nThe Star singers walk about from house to house \"singing at the doors, with a star on a pole\". The dramatic part is introduced by one of the Wise Men knocking on someone's door asking: \"May the star come in?\" If the offer is accepted, they are all invited inside. Then the whole procession will enter the home singing a special Christmas carol. Then the play begins.\n\nIn the performance, the Three Wise Men, Gaspar, Melchior and Balthazar, are first confronted by Joseph, who tries to protect the newborn baby Jesus (a doll) and his wife Mary from the intruders with a wooden axe. The three magi are however most welcome inside after saying that they have brought with them presents for the child. The Wise Men also have to mislead King Herod, who is also trying to find the new born 'prince' in the stable. Both Gaspar and Melchior fight the king and his men with swords, together with Joseph who uses his broad axe, while Mary nurses her son and Balthazar takes care of the shining star.\n\nAfter the performance Judas comes to collect money or other gifts from the audience in a large bag. The boys and girls are usually treated to drinks and cakes afterwards. Then the Star singers leave the house for their next visit to somewhere in the neighbourhood, singing a song containing a farewell and many thanks for the received gifts.\n\nThe star itself is made anew each year, using transparent paper on a constructed frame built of wooden lists and with one to three candles placed inside. The star on the rod has to be movable and turned around all the time, so that the paper does not get overheated and does not go up in flame.\n\nThe Star boys' singing procession in England seems later to have been mixed together with several other kinds of carol singers at Christmas. They do not go from house to house, but visit two or three local pubs to receive free beer. Nowadays they are not carrying the shining star anymore, but just a quadrangular paraffin wax on a long stick or even a candle lamp with an ordinary handle. Whereas religious folk plays are the norm in the rest of Europe, the British folk drama is absolutely secular, even if they are mostly taking place on the Christian festival days.\n\nIn the Nordic countries the Star boys' singing procession is known all along the coast, though not often in inland communities. At the end of the 1880s many objected to this Catholic form of organised begging, and officials began forbidding the practice. By the 1900s it had largely disappeared, and there are now just a few places where the original play of the Star boys can be counted as an unbroken linear tradition, for instance the islands Amager in Denmark, and Haram and Vigra on the west coast of Norway, but the most famous one is probably the Star boys' singing procession in the small town of Grimstad on the south coast of Norway.\n\nIn 19th century the Swedish Star boys started to join in with horse riding on St. Stephen's Day, 26 December. The tradition of Star boys (sometimes even with Judas Iscariot), singing and acting about Christmas, Saint Stephen and Epiphany, has traditionally been performed from St. Stephen's Day until Epiphany.\n\nToday they are only to be seen bringing up the rear together with bridesmaids and elves as a part of the Lucia procession on December 13. Recently school teachers, nursery nurses and Christian clergymen have tried to revitalize the play for small children, inviting their parents to come to the schools, the kindergartens or the churches to see it performed. But the popular and more humorous folkloristic elements of the play are often left out.\n\nIn Finland, a version of the Star boys' procession originating in the city of Oulu, a musical play known as \"Tiernapojat\", has become established as a cherished Christmas tradition nationwide. The \"Tiernapojat\" show is a staple of Christmas festivities in schools, kindergartens, and elsewhere, and it is broadcast every Christmas on radio and television. The Finnish version contains non-biblical elements such as king Herod vanquishing the \"king of the Moors\", and a short song of praise to Tsar Alexander.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is based on the manga memoir \"A Drifting Life\" and five earlier short stories by the Japanese manga artist Yoshihiro Tatsumi. The film is a Singaporean production with Japanese dialogue, and was animated in Indonesia.\n\nThe film premiered in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2011. It later made its box office debut in the Singapore box office on 15 September 2011. The film was selected as the Singaporean entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist.\n\nThe film follows the career of Yoshihiro Tatsumi, as he begins to work as a comics artist in post-war occupied Japan, meets his idol Osamu Tezuka, and invents the gekiga genre of Japanese comics for adults. Interwoven with the biographical material are segments based on Tatsumi's short stories \"Hell\", \"Beloved Monkey\", \"Just a Man\", \"Good-Bye\" and \"Occupied\".\n\n\nSingaporean director Eric Khoo, who previously exclusively made live-action films but has a past as a comics artist, was first introduced to the works of Yoshihiro Tatsumi during his military service, and says that he immediately was stricken by the sadness and beauty of the stories. When Tatsumi's 840-page autobiographical manga, \"A Drifting Life\", was published in Singapore in 2009, Khoo realised that Tatsumi still was alive and wanted to pay tribute to him. Khoo visited Tatsumi in Japan in October 2009 and received the permission to adapt the work to film. Production was led by Khoo's Singaporean company Zhao Wei Films. The budget of the film corresponded to 800,000 US dollars.\n\nThe visual style and storyboards of the film were kept tightly to Tatsumi's original drawings. Khoo said: \"You see, Tatsumi loves cinema, and when he created this new movement of comics using strips with real characters, rather than the four-panel manga convention, he produced works that are like storyboards for a film. All we need to do is stretch them out to a widescreen format. And give them multi-planes, like layers, so there is more depth and feel. I also tweaked certain things, changed some of the sequences of the stories, so for the cinema his stories got a new voice.\"\n\nTatsumi himself was involved in the project and oversaw details to secure authenticity, as well as provided the narration for the biographical segments. Other prominent voices were performed by the Japanese stage actor Tetsuya Bessho. Minor characters were played by amateurs from Singapore's Japanese minority. People with roots in Osaka were sought out specifically, and Tatsumi instructed the actors how to speak the Osaka dialect of the 1950s.\n\nAnimation work started in March 2010 at Infinite Frameworks Studios in Batam, Indonesia. It involved a team of 25 artists who previously had worked mainly on syndicated television shows.\n\nThe theme song of this film was composed by director Eric Khoo's then 13-year-old son Christopher. Christopher composed a total of 3 musical compositions for the film.\n\nIn a review written at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, the Hollywood Reporter said reviewed that the film \"evinces a mood that is unutterably sad, yet indescribably beautiful.\", but added that \"the sinister and decidedly adult subject matter may scale down its widespread marketability\". The reviewer also praised the three music compositions, which she felt \"lend the biographical segments a sweetly rueful timbre\". The reviewer also said that \"the uncompromising, shattering power of the stories, (made) the account of Tatsumi's life seem less engaging.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "759763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=759763", "title": "Tickle Me Elmo", "text": "Tickle Me Elmo\n\nTickle Me Elmo is a children's plush toy from Tyco Preschool, a division of Tyco Toys, of the Muppet character Elmo from the children's television show, Sesame Street. When squeezed, Elmo shakes, vibrates, and recites his trademark giggle, \"Uh-ha-ha-ha-hee-hee!\".\n\nThe toy was first produced in the United States in 1996 and slowly became a fad toy. Some instances of violence were reported over the limited supply amidst heavy consumer demand. \"People\" reported that the toy which retailed for $28.99 according to its MSRP, had been advertised in newspapers and on the Internet, with sellers asking up to $1,500 by the end of 1997.\n\n\"Tickles The Chimp\", the precursor to Tickle Me Elmo, was invented by Greg Hyman and Ron Dubren, who were known in the toy indusry for having had invented Alphie the Robot (a children's learning computer) several years prior. In 1995 it was presented to Tyco Preschool as \"Tickles The Chimp,\" which was a toy monkey with a computer chip which laughed when tickled. At the time Tyco didn't have rights to make \"Sesame Street\" plush, but did have \"Looney Tunes\" plush rights so it was worked on for several months as Tickle Me Tasmanian Devil, they also made Tickle Me versions of baby Bugs Bunny and Tweety, they successfully sold it at WB Studio Store in California. They are on Ebay and Amazon too. A short time later, Tyco lost rights to do \"Looney Tunes\" but gained the rights to \"Sesame Street,\" thus starting Tickle Me Elmo. The invention was originally introduced under Cabbage Patch at Hasbro Industries.\n\nNeil Friedman, who was then president of Tyco Preschool, recalled years later that, \"When you played with [Tickle Me Elmo] for the first time, it brought a smile to everyone's face. It was a magical surprise.\"\n\nTickle Me Elmo was released in July 1996, with a supply of 400,000 units. The dolls sold well and remained widely available in stores until the day after Thanksgiving, when they suddenly sold out. With the Christmas shopping season approaching, Tyco Preschool ordered 600,000 more dolls from their suppliers. Promotion was helped by Rosie O'Donnell, who had shown the toy on her popular TV show in early October. O'Donnell's \"surprise plug\" created unexpected demand for Elmo, resulting in shortages in the stores that sold it.\n\nThe scarcity of the new toy provoked a \"shopping frenzy\". Two women were arrested in Chicago for fighting over the doll, while in New York some people ran after delivery trucks hoping to get their hands on Elmo before it reached stores. Someone allegedly purchased a Tickle Me Elmo for $7,100 in Denver. A clerk working at a Wal-Mart store in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada was among those injured by \"Elmo-mania\". During a Midnight Madness sale on December 14, a crowd of 300 stampeded down the aisle after spotting him being handed a box of the toys by another employee. Trampled, he suffered \"a pulled hamstring, injuries to his back, jaw and knee, a broken rib and a concussion\".\n\nBy the end of December, the entire stock of one million \"Tickle Me Elmo\" toys had been sold.\n\nIn early 1997, Tyco released new \"Tickle Me\" toys based on other characters from \"Sesame Street\" – first \"Tickle Me Ernie\" and \"Tickle Me Big Bird\", then \"Tickle Me Cookie Monster\" – but despite good sales, none of these toys achieved as much fame as Tickle Me Elmo. With the re-release of Tickle Me Elmo, \"Mini Tickle Me Cookie Monster\" and \"Mini Tickle Me Ernie\" were also put on the market.\n\nThe \"Surprise Edition\" of Tickle Me Elmo, issued fall 2001, was an elaborate contest. Five of the \"Surprise Edition\" Elmos stopped laughing on January 9, 2002, and instead announced to the people squeezing them that they had won a prize. The grand prize was $200,000.\n\nIn 2006 for the tenth anniversary of Tickle Me Elmo, Fisher-Price released a new Elmo doll called \"TMX\", meaning \"Tickle Me (Elmo) Ten\" or \"Tickle Me eXtreme\". The toy, which was designed by Bruce Lund of Lund and Co. Invention (River Forest, Illinois), was first announced at the American International Toy Fair. Rather than simply vibrating like the original, the TMX rolls around on the floor, laughing and smashing his fist on the ground, begging for the tickler to stop.\n\nThe full look of the doll was not revealed until it debuted live on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" and arrived on store shelves on September 19, 2006. Toy experts said that the delay was unprecedented, with only a few people in the media allowed to preview the product, and only after signing confidentiality agreements. The packaging was designed so that the doll could not be seen without purchasing it. The box includes a preview flap, but upon opening, only the doll's eyes are visible. It requires six AA batteries, and costs approximately $40. In a promotional clip, Jim Silver, co-publisher of \"Toy Wishes\" magazine said, \"The first reaction I had was, 'Where are the wires?' Because I didn't think anything like that could move on its own.\".\nToy analyst Chris Byrne told \"USA Today\", \"This is a quantum leap forward, another breakthrough in the preschool plush category.\" Byrne believed sales would be high, but the reaction would not be as unprecedented. \"The culture has moved beyond that, the whole hot-toy phenomenon.\" He cited the fact there has not been such a craze since Furby in 1998. However, some members of the media expected a large response. Toys \"R\" Us stores and Amazon had a pre-sale program for the doll, the first included elaborate in-store displays with a digital countdown to the doll's launch. Amazon took more presale orders than it could fulfill. As with the original Tickle Me Elmo doll, demand for the new toy gave rise to some extreme acts. One person in Tampa, Florida was allegedly threatened with a gun to hand over a TMX toy. This was parodied on \"Saturday Night Live\", which said the man \"was subdued by the new 'Gimmie a Reason Bert'\".\n\nTMX and other toys helped Mattel's earnings for the third quarter of the 2006 financial year to grow by six percent and beat the expectations of financial analysts. TMX also helped increase sales of other Elmo toys.\n\nIn January 2007, Mattel announced it would release \"TMX Friends\", featuring Elmo, Ernie and Cookie Monster.\n\nFor the Christmas 2007 season, Fisher-Price released a version with hidden surprises. Mattel has provided a website with rhyming clues that can help find the special messages.\n\nPlayskool released the toy again as \"LOL Elmo\". Not a single image of the toy was revealed until the American International Toy Fair 2012; in the Hasbro showroom's Sesame Street section, there is a sign printed \"Laughter Unleashed! Fall 2012\". Above it was a video of kids giggling. The toy was released in September. It is also known as Tickle Time Elmo.\n\nPlayskool made a new version of this toy once again but they made it part of their Playskool Friends lineup. Its behavior is like the 1996 version but has more phrases like \"Elmo is one ticklish monster\". This toy released in August 2017. It can be found at Walmart, Books A Million, Best Buy, Target, Toys R Us before it closed and more. It can still be found\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1743443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1743443", "title": "Ventriloquist (comics)", "text": "Ventriloquist (comics)\n\nThe Ventriloquist is the name of three fictional characters, supervillains appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. All of the Ventriloquist's versions are enemies of Batman, belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up Batman's rogues gallery.\n\nThe original Ventriloquist, Arnold Wesker, first appeared in \"Detective Comics\" #583 (February 1988) and was created by John Wagner, Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle.\n\nIn \"Detective Comics\" #827 (March 2007), a new Ventriloquist (Peyton Riley) was introduced by Paul Dini and Don Kramer.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new Ventriloquist was introduced named Shauna Belzer, first appearing in \"Batgirl\" #20 (July 2013), as created by Gail Simone and Fernando Pasarin.\n\nA meek, quiet man named Arnold Wesker (the first Ventriloquist) plans and executes his crimes through a dummy named Scarface, with the dress and persona of a 1920s gangster (complete with pinstripe suit, cigar, and Tommy gun). His name comes from the nickname of Al Capone, after whom Scarface is modeled.\n\nBorn into a powerful Mafia family, Wesker develops dissociative identity disorder after seeing his mother assassinated by thugs from a rival family. Growing up, his only outlet is ventriloquism.\n\n\"Showcase '94\" #8-9 establishes an alternate origin story: after a barroom brawl in which he kills someone during a violent release of his repressed anger, Wesker is sent to Blackgate Penitentiary. He is introduced to \"Woody\" — a dummy carved from the remains of the former Blackgate gallows by his cellmate Donnegan — who convinces him to escape and kill Donnegan in a fight which scars the dummy, thus resulting in the birth of Scarface.\n\nWesker lets the Scarface personality do the dirty work, including robbery and murder. He is totally dominated by Scarface, who barks orders at him and degrades him with verbal (and even physical) abuse. Wesker is unable to enunciate the letter \"B\" in his words while throwing his voice and replaces them with the letter \"G\" instead (for example, Scarface often calls Batman and Robin \"Gatman and Rogin\").\n\nIn the 1995 Riddler story \"Riddler: The Riddle Factory\", it is revealed that a gangster named \"Scarface\" Scarelli had once been active in Gotham City, though he had apparently died long before Batman's era. A supernatural aspect to Scarface was hinted at in Wesker's alternate origin story in \"Showcase '94\" #8-9, when Wesker's cellmate creates the first Scarface dummy from pieces of wood from the remains of Blackgate Prison's gallows. 2001's \"Batman/Scarface: A Psychodrama\" reinforces this and shows the dummy to be indirectly responsible for two accidents while separated from Wesker (with at least one fatality). The dummy also retained his speech impediment while operated by a young boy and seemed to even show awareness of his name during this period.\n\nThe Ventriloquist is one of many villains in the Batman's rogues gallery to be confined to Arkham Asylum when Batman apprehends him. One particularly memorable series of events concerning him took place during the \"\" storyline, after Bane had destroyed Arkham and released its inmates. Unable to find Scarface, the Ventriloquist uses a sock puppet in his place for a short time (aptly named Socko). After an ill-fated team-up with fellow escapee Amygdala, he procures a number of other hand puppets to fill in for Scarface, including one of a police officer which he refers to as \"Chief O'Hara\". Later, when Wesker does indeed find Scarface, Scarface and Socko are set at odds until a standoff occurs, and the puppets shoot each other, leaving Wesker unconscious and bleeding from two wounded hands.\n\nDuring the events of the \"\" story arc, the stress caused by the earthquake apparently triggered the release of another personality within Wesker in the form of the 'Quakemaster', who claimed to have caused the earthquake himself over a video and threatened to trigger another unless he was paid $100 million. However, the seismologist Quakemaster had captured to provide him with information deliberately feeds him inaccurate scientific data to provide detectives looking for her with information as to her location. Robin subsequently deduces 'Quakemaster's' true identity, due to his speeches always taking great effort to avoid saying any words with the letter \"B\".\n\nIn one issue, Wesker is apparently killed, and in a bizarre twist, Scarface appears to still talk and act alive before he is destroyed. This death appears to have been retconned in \"One Year Later\" (presumably due to the events of the \"Infinite Crisis\" crossover). Wesker appears as one of the members of the Secret Society of Super Villains that faces the Jade Canary, who pitches Scarface off the top of a roof.\nIn \"Detective Comics\" #818, an issue later included in the trade paperback \"\", Wesker is murdered by an unseen assailant. The dummy Scarface is stepped on and its head crushed. The dying Wesker uses Scarface's hand to leave a clue regarding his murder: a street name. Later in the storyline, it is revealed that Tally Man, acting as an enforcer for the Great White Shark, is responsible for the murder.\n\nDuring the \"Blackest Night\" crossover, Wesker is among the many deceased villains that receive a black power ring and is reanimated into a Black Lantern. Using his power ring, Wesker creates a construct of Scarface made of black energy. He is shown murdering many police officers.\n\nIn September 2011, \"The New 52\" rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Arnold Wesker was never killed. He appears in \"\" #2. Implied to be in possession of the Venom steroid, he clashes briefly with Nightwing.\n\nDuring \"The War of Jokes and Riddles\", Wesker and Scarface are seen as part of the Joker's gang in his gang war against the Riddler's gang.\n\nIn \"Harley Quinn: Rebirth\", after turning on the Penguin, the Ventriloquist and Scarface join up with the few remaining crimelords of New York that managed to escape from the Penguin's giant penguins and they help Harley to fight back. Afterwards, he is put in charge of Coney Island's Mafia.\n\nA new female Ventriloquist, Peyton Riley, called \"Sugar\" by Scarface, soon surfaced in the pages of \"Detective Comics\". Batman responded to a police scanner call - witnesses said Catwoman had been shot. He got to the body, which had a note on it that read \"dummy.\" A counter started at four seconds - he got out as the place exploded. When he got back to his car, there was a dummy posing as Robin. He shot it with a grapple and it, too, exploded.\n\nBatman had the police exhume Arnold Wesker's body, but the coffin was empty. Bruce went out disguised as Lefty Knox to see what the underground was saying. Within a week, he heard the Ventriloquist was making a comeback at the Iceberg Lounge. \"Lefty\" attended the big show - as the curtains parted, Wesker sat with Scarface in his lap. A beautiful blonde whom Scarface calls \"Sugar\" knocked over the dead body, picked up the dummy, and continued on. When she was questioned by an audience member, she shot him. Scarface told the room he was working on a plan to take over the city, but would have to remove Batman from the equation first. He called Batman out, knowing that he would be in the audience. Bruce threw his voice and made it look like one of the other criminals was confessing. A batarang flew and took out the lights. Scarface opened fire. Batman swooped in and grabbed the woman and the dummy. He separated them and realized the dummy was a bomb. The woman escaped. Batman informed Gordon of what had happened.\n\nSugar is a more compatible partner than Wesker, since Scarface no longer substitutes \"B\" with \"G\", and she is far more willing to commit violent crime. When nearly captured by Batman and Harley Quinn (who had been close to Wesker after he tried to cheer her up when she was initially sent to Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose), Sugar has Scarface say, \"Save yourself.\" Unlike Wesker, who is horrified at any damage to Scarface, Sugar rigs her dummies to explode, using this to cover her escapes. She has numerous identical dummies at her hideout, one of which then becomes the \"real\" Scarface.\n\nDuring \"Gotham Underground\" #2 (January 2008), Sugar and Scarface, along with Lock-Up, the Firefly, and Killer Moth are told by the Scarecrow that the Penguin is working for the Suicide Squad. They attack him, but end up meeting a team of criminals working for the Penguin. While they try to escape, they are brought to a dead end by the Scarecrow. Tobias Whale shoots Scarface, but lets Sugar live, although he informs one of the men escorting her that she is to be \"hurt\".\n\nIn \"Detective Comics\" #843 (April 2008), Scarface kidnaps a rival gangster, Johnny Sabatino, and takes Bruce Wayne hostage. While alone, Sugar breaks away from Scarface and talks to Bruce in what appears to be her 'real' personality. She reveals that she was engaged to Wayne's friend, Matthew Atkins, \"years ago.\" Her real name is revealed to be Peyton Riley, and she expresses remorse for her crimes before the Scarface persona reappears and interrupts their conversation.\n\nIn the following issue, Riley reveals that her father, an Irish Mafia boss named Sean Riley, wanted to marry her off to Sabatino, forming a permanent alliance between Gotham's Irish and Italian gangs. Sean Riley therefore assaults Peyton's fiancé, leaving him in intensive care. He subsequently becomes an alcoholic, and Peyton was forced to marry Sabatino. This does not lead to the hoped-for gang alliance, as Sabatino proves to be an inept gangster. He and Peyton are eventually taken to see Scarface, as Sabatino had cheated him on a weapons deal. Both Scarface and Wesker were impressed by Peyton's intelligence, and give Sabatino a second chance, taking 30% of his profits.\n\nIn \"Detective Comics\" #850 (November 2008), she and Tommy Elliot bond over their mutual resentment of their families, and vow that they will escape together when Elliot comes into his fortune. However, Elliot's ailing mother does not approve of their relationship, and when Tommy refuses to stop seeing Peyton, she writes him out of her will. Peyton subsequently runs the departing family lawyer off of the road and kills him (calling in a favour from some of her father's men to \"take care of the details\"), while Elliot murders his mother. Peyton declares that they can finally be free together - only to be abandoned by Elliot, who later describes her as a \"sweet girl, but too needy.\"\n\nWhen Scarface's hold on the mob begins to crumble, Sabatino, now a crime boss in his own right, decides to cement his own position by wiping out the Rileys. After killing his father-in-law, he takes Peyton to a gangster's hide-out and shoots her in the head. She survives, however, and regains consciousness just as the Tally Man is killing Wesker nearby. Peyton finds the body of Wesker, and is shocked to hear Scarface talking to her. Although she suspects she may be hallucinating, she forms a partnership with him.\n\nScarface and Peyton plan to throw Sabatino over the side of his own yacht. Zatanna rescues Wayne from something, and, as Batman, he proceeds to rescue Sabatino while Zatanna tries to talk down Peyton, explaining that dolls and puppets have powerful magic. Before she can have any effect, a thug named Moose hits her with an oar. While Batman protects Zatanna from Moose, Peyton makes another attempt to throw Sabatino over the side, but gets too close, and he begins to strangle her with his own bonds. Scarface quietly says, \"Jump, Sugar\", and Peyton sends them both over the side. Before they hit the water, Scarface says \"G'bye, kiddo. I loved y...\" Riley has not appeared again ever since.\n\nIn \"The New 52\", a new Ventriloquist debuted in the pages of \"Batgirl\". Shauna Belzer grew up in the shadow of her twin brother Ferdie, whom their parents treated as a favorite while ignoring her; other children, meanwhile, idolized Ferdie while bullying her. When Shauna learned she could move things with her mind, she used her newfound powers to murder one of her tormentors. She would later use these powers to kill her hated brother and make it look like an accident.\n\nShauna was trying to find her place in the world when she first met Ferdie, the dummy. She saw him at a birthday party and killed the clown who was using him. Shauna would later go on to kill her parents and start doing ventriloquist acts that would usually end with a dead audience.\n\nShauna is one of six individuals who are kidnapped by a man identifying himself as the Mockingbird, and sealed inside a shipping container on the bottom of the ocean. Besides Shauna, the others are the Catman, Big Shot, Black Alice, Strix and Porcelain. After escaping, this group becomes known as the new Secret Six. The Mockingbird is eventually revealed to be the Riddler, who believes that one of the six stole a priceless diamond from him, but he does not know who. The thief is revealed to be the ventriloquist doll Ferdie, who had stolen the diamond and hidden it within his own wooden body, his persona being so separate from Shauna's that she did not even realize that her doll was the thief. In the final issue of the \"Secret Six\" series, Shauna betrays the team and abandons Ferdie when he insists that they remain loyal to the group. Shauna is incarcerated in Arkham Asylum, where she is now using a sock puppet as her new doll.\n\nThe first Ventriloquist has no superhuman powers and is not a good hand-to-hand combatant. He is a skilled ventriloquist and his Scarface persona is a skilled criminal strategist. However, he is unable to pronounce any word with a letter \"B\" in it accurately without moving his lips, giving Scarface a speech impediment in which he says every \"B\" in a word as a \"G\". Wesker usually carries a handgun of some kind, while Scarface carries a trademark Tommy gun. However, Wesker tends to show that he and Scarface hold two different personalities and he and Scarface can sometimes argue amongst each other, which tends to work as an advantage to Batman in several occasions.\n\nThe second Ventriloquist is much more skilled in ventriloquism than her predecessor and is capable of pronouncing all speech patterns with more proficiency when in her Scarface persona. Unlike the first one, the second Ventriloquist's personality does not contradict Scarface's and is much more willing to commit cruel acts, especially since she believes that the she and the dummy are in a romantic relationship. Coming from an elite Mafia family, she is also a brilliant criminal mastermind.\n\nThe third Ventriloquist is, possibly, a metahuman capable of controlling other beings. Her psychotic mind often leads those to gain their own personalities.\n\nIn the DCAU-continuity comic books, Scarface has his speech impediment from the mainstream DC Universe version. This was explained by Scarface claiming that, while \"in prison\" after one of Wesker's arrests, he was involved in a fight where a fellow inmate tore his lips off.\n\nIn \"\" #29-31, the Ventriloquist and Scarface are seen participating in Two-Face's trial against Joker as a juror, where he voted guilty due to Joker forcefully taking Scarface from him.\n\nIn the \"Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" crossover, Arnold Wesker's Ventriloquist appears mutated into a macaw by the Shredder and the Foot Clan to attack Batman and Robin. Batman is captured, but Robin manages to escape. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Splinter then arrive, where Splinter defeats the mutated villains, while Batman uses his new Intimidator Armor to defeat the Shredder and the Turtles defeat Ra's al Ghul. Later, Gordon tells Batman that the police scientists have managed to turn all of the Arkham inmates, including Wesker, back to normal and they are currently in A.R.G.U.S. custody.\n\nThe Arnold Wesker incarnation of the Ventriloquist has a minor appearance in \"\". Wesker, along with several other Batman villains, is tricked by Jack Napier (who in this reality was a Joker who had been force-fed an overdose of pills by Batman which temporarily cured him of his insanity) into drinking drinks that had been laced with particles from Clayface's body. This was done so that Napier, who was using the Mad Hatter’s technology to control Clayface, could control them by way of Clayface’s ability to control parts of his body that had been separated from him. Wesker and the other villains are then used to attack a library which Napier himself was instrumental in building in one of Gotham City’s poorer districts. Later on in the story, the control hat is stolen by the Neo-Joker (the second Harley Quinn, who felt that Jack Napier was a pathetic abnormality while the Joker was the true, beautiful personality) in an effort to get Napier to release the Joker persona.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The brand consists of fewer than 40 franchised stores within Australia and over 1200 kiosks. At its peak, Video Ezy had over 500 stores and in the 1980s and '90s, the company expanded into Asia. \n\nBetween 2011 and 2014, Video Ezy entered the online market and launched rental kiosks. Consumer prices to rent are much lower, no membership cards are required, and DVDs, Ultra HD Blu-rays and Blu-rays can be returned to any kiosk machine nationwide. \n\nThe now mostly defunct franchise's fall is attributed to the rise of online piracy and the local introduction of streaming services such as Netflix, Stan and Amazon Prime.\n\nVideo Ezy commenced trading in 1983, when Kevin Slater opened his first store in the Sydney suburb of Hurstville renting out a small selection of VHS and Betamax format movies. The first franchised store opened in September 1984 at Miranda. The franchisees at Miranda were Peter McLaughlin and Bill Coe. Other stores to open in quick succession were in the Sydney suburbs of Bankstown, Liverpool and Chatswood. In the majority of these stores, Kevin funded 50% of the capital required to open. By 1986, Video Ezy comprised 18 stores, and by August 1987, there were 34 stores located across New South Wales and Queensland. Expansion followed throughout other Australian states before opening its first international location in Auckland, New Zealand in 1988, with the Master Licence commencing in 1991 under Video Ezy International. In March 1999, Video Ezy Australasia Pty Ltd expanded into the Asian market with its first outlet opening in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nIn late 2000, Video Ezy introduced EzyRetail, a video store specific point of sale Windows-based system exclusively used by Video Ezy. The software was first developed by Radek Soucek and Robert Gongorra and allowed information to be centrally created and pushed down the line to stores, both as real-time and locally stored data. It provided comprehensive reporting capabilities, inventory management and collection abilities, giving the store network one of the most comprehensive databases in retail history. This new system replaced VideoMinder, a then DOS-based system once used by Blockbuster and some older Video Ezy franchisees.\n\nIn 2001, the first Video Ezy outlet opened in Singapore within the Jelita Shopping Centre. Since then, the Singapore network has comprised a mixture of corporate-owned and franchised stores located in either outdoor shopping strips like, Holland Village, residential towers such as, International Plaza, or large shopping centres such as, VivoCity. Unlike Australia, Video Ezy Singapore can operate in most shopping centres due to 7-day-week late night shopping hours and its population less reliant on private automobiles needing to park outside stores.\n\nIn 2003, Video Ezy sold its corporate-owned stores in Australia leaving only 2 stores–Narellan and Rosehill, some 10 minutes from its new Head Office at Rhodes–although in 2006 it had acquired additional corporate-owned stores. In 2003, Video Ezy also went on to market a subscription model with DVD Unlimited (not associated with the New Zealand company with the same name). Also in that year, Video Ezy commenced selling and renting 'Ezy Exclusive' TV series and movies on DVD such as, \"Dinotopia\", \"Kingpin\", \"Will & Grace\", \"Taken\", \"The Believer\" and other exclusive titles from Hallmark Entertainment and NBC. These titles were usually branded with Video Ezy's logo and carried slightly different artwork to DVDs sold outside the Region 4 market ('Ezy Exclusives' were phased out in 2006).\n\nIn August 2005, business partners, Paul Uniacke and Edward Nedelko - who between them owned 24 Video Ezy franchises in Victoria - purchased the shares held in Video Ezy Australasia Pty Ltd by Perpetual Trustees and Ivany Investments to become majority shareholders in the company. They replaced Robert Maidment as Executive Chairman. At that stage Video Ezy-branded outlets numbered, 560 in Australia, 156 in New Zealand, 128 in Thailand, 135 in Indonesia, 19 in Singapore, 9 in Malaysia, 1 in Fiji and 1 in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn February 2007, Blockbuster, seeking to rationalise its international operations and concentrate on its home United States market, sold its entire Australian store network to Video Ezy Australasia Pty Ltd. At the time, Blockbuster Australia comprised 370 outlets nationwide - 29 owned by the company and 341 owned by franchisees. Video Ezy had 518 Australian outlets, all of them being owned by franchisees, pushing the combined group's market share to 40% of the country's video rental sector. Video Ezy committed to the master franchise agreement with Blockbuster for 10 years operating the brand with the possibility of renewal for a further 10 years after that. As a consequence of the deal, the company changed its name from Video Ezy Australasia Pty Ltd to Franchise Entertainment Group.\n\nIn January 2009, Franchise Entertainment Group bought failed video retail (non-rental) chain, EzyDVD from receivers, Ferrier Hodgson, for an estimated $10 million. The transaction included, the EzyDVD brand and online business, the 25-store franchise network, in addition to stock, plant, equipment and the remaining 11 company-owned stores. FEG CEO Paul Uniacke said to the media after the deal, \"We don't have video rental stores in high-traffic areas such as the major malls because you can't rent a DVD and the next day just easily park your car and return to it. The EzyDVD stores are in all the major mall chains and this cements us well and truly in this market.\" Soon after, EzyDVD's head office, warehouse and distribution facility in Torrensville closed, and currently (as of October 2012), only 3 branded stores remain in Launceston, Browns Plains and Elizabeth. Most of its sales are now generated from the website.\n\nIn August 2010, Paul Uniacke and Edward Nedelko's other company, Surrealus, bought the failed entertainment group, Stomp Entertainment (which included the Australian operations of Play4Me and CD WOW!) for an undisclosed sum. By October that year, Surrealus had reorganised Stomp and given it a new name - Élan Media Partners. Uniacke and Nedelko also arranged for the transfer of the Video Ezy Australia, Blockbuster Australia and EzyDVD online businesses from FEG to Élan Media Partners, leaving FEG to manage the franchise relationships with individual Video Ezy/Blockbuster outlets and the three remaining EzyDVD-branded stores.\n\nIn May 2011, a new loyalty card branded as Flash Rewards was introduced by Video Ezy (superseding DVD Unlimited), offering customers who sign-up and pay a fee, discounts and extended services in all participating Video Ezy stores. This allows customers to upgrade their basic rental membership, with Paul Uniacke adding, \"when someone joins Flash Rewards, they can then rent from any participating Video Ezy store and access their Flash benefits without the need to sign up with each store every time.\" In addition, Flash Rewards offered discounts from partner companies such as, Donut King, Eagle Boys Pizza, AMF Bowling, Anytime Fitness, ACP Magazines, and 25% off cinema ticket prices at, Village Cinemas, Event Cinemas/Greater Union/Birch Carroll & Coyle, Hoyts, Reading Cinemas, Wallis Cinemas, Dendy, and Palace Cinemas. However, the deals involving outside partner companies ended in early 2013.\n\nIn June 2011, a select group of Video Ezy/Blockbuster franchises incorporated Metcash's Lucky 7 convenience stores stocking more than 500 different products including, newspapers, bread, milk and various snacks. If deemed successful, Lucky 7 could roll out nationally across Video Ezy and Blockbuster's 650 store network.\n\nIn October 2011, it was announced that former chief executive of Video Ezy and their largest franchisee, Daryl McCormack, would partner his 15 stores with Franchised Food Company's Cold Rock Ice Creamery to open smaller, Express oulets within stores becoming dual franchises. The first Video Ezy/Cold Rock Express outlet reopened in Kew, Melbourne, to dollar-for-dollar sales with the core business of video rental and retail. This concept has also extended to McCormack's co-owned chain, Souvlaki Hut (now Souv Hut), with point-of-sale systems being updated to combine sales from both video and ice cream, or souvlaki meals and ice cream. Like the Lucky 7 deal before it, Franchised Food Company is offering Cold Rock Express outlets to other Video Ezy/Blockbuster franchisees wishing to diversify their business.\n\nIn November 2011, Video Ezy found itself embroiled in a social media backlash when it refused to end its long-term sponsorship with Southern Cross Austereo's networked radio program, \"Take40 Australia\", after its co-host, Kyle Sandilands made sexist comments about a News Limited journalist on his 2Day FM breakfast program, \"The Kyle and Jackie O Show\". Even though the comments were made on another program and Video Ezy having the added complication of being a naming rights sponsor of Take40 Australia, complaints piled up on its Facebook page to such an extent that after a month the brand was forced to pull advertising from the show temporarily during the summer. Sandilands was removed as co-host of Take40 Australia during this period, and Video Ezy continues to sponsor the program.\n\nIn December 2011, Franchise Entertainment Group switched on its first Video Ezy Express DVD and Blu-ray rental kiosk after announcing their roll-out in May that year. FEG bought 1,000 DVD kiosks through US company, NCR Corporation for $2 million with Uniacke adding, \"we're looking to get to 3,000 within three years. I'm looking to own the market within a two-year period.\" Video Ezy Express kiosks can be leased from FEG by local Video Ezy/Blockbuster franchisees and located in high foot-traffic areas like shopping centres and supermarkets. For consumers, prices to rent are much lower, and no membership cards are required with the initial rental fee and extended fees being charged direct to the consumers credit card. Video Ezy/Blockbuster Express currently competes in Australia and New Zealand with the 300+ Hoyts Kiosk network. They also competed with approximately 100 RedRoom kiosks for the first month until FEG acquired the entire seven-year-old business, taking out a significant competitor while adding capacity.\n\nIn 1993, the \"Get it first time, or get it free\" was launched. Video Ezy re-launched their guarantee under the \"Movie Guarantee\" umbrella in April 2007. This includes Rental Guarantee, Price Guarantee and an Ex-Rental Guarantee.\n\nVideo Ezy utilises rent-only releases with the \"Rent It - The Only Way To Get It\" campaign. Another advertising campaign used by Video Ezy is \"Upsize Your Entertainment\" - when a consumer rents a specific title they have the opportunity to upsize by buying a specified similar title for only $4.95–in April 2007, Video Ezy had Charlotte's Web as the rental title & Paulie as the upsize title.\n\nSlogans include:\n\nIn 2000, Video Ezy launched its Fight Back campaign, using slogans such as \"Sick of low interest rates? - bank on cheap entertainment with Video Ezy. Due to the franchise nature of Video Ezy stores, each store runs their own promotions and set their own pricing.\n\nThe company established a training facility in 2006 to develop staff expertise. They had previously worked with a company called \"Rascals\" which promoted the use of Australian Workplace Agreements.\n\nIn its home market of Australia, Video Ezy's individual franchises compete with other rental chains such as, Blockbuster, Civic Video, Network Video, Video City, Movies 4U (also known as, Top Video, or Leading Edge Video) and many independently-branded stores throughout the country. Franchises also compete with rental-by-mail and instant streaming service, Quickflix. Video Ezy dominates the New South Wales market, however, in other Australian states like Queensland, it has a similar number of stores to rival, Civic Video, and in Tasmania, its chain of Video City oulets are more numerous and larger in floor space. Since February 2007, Video Ezy's parent company, Franchise Entertainment Group, no longer competes with Blockbuster having acquired it, yet all individual franchises still do.\n\nIn the area of video and gaming retail, Video Ezy also competes with many of the brands mentioned above, but primarily Australia's DVD, Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray and gaming disc market share is taken up by Kmart, Target, Big W, Sanity, JB Hi-Fi, EB Games, and Amazon.com. However, recent years have seen huge movements towards legal and illegal online entertainment in the form of legal services such as iTunes or illegal BitTorrent downloads that continue to challenge Video Ezy's established business model. This is reflected in Video Ezy/Blockbuster franchises closing 270 stores across Australia in the four years to August 2011, and Video Ezy's Indonesian franchises shutting 60 outlets in the two years to January 2013. Even some Australian regional centres such as Lithgow and Berri have recently lost their only full scale video libraries when Video Ezy/Blockbuster franchises have closed.\n\nIn March 2013, Franchise Entertainment Group's CEO, Paul Uniacke told \"Sunshine Coast Daily\" in response to a local Maroochydore outlet closing that, \"I'm not happy that Maroochydore has gone. It's not something we like to see, absolutely there is a human cost to what's happening here.\" He went on to add, \"the worst thing that happens in a rationalisation is losing stores and losing good people. We've been up on the Coast with Blockbuster for a number of years and with Video Ezy for about 20 years.\" Uniacke said that Video Ezy/Blockbuster was not alone in facing Australian post-Global Financial Crisis retail conditions, leaving Video Ezy Express rental kiosks to fill the void left by closed stores. He said, \"but mark my words, you will see us back in a short space of time. We don't want to leave that territory without the brand too long, we want to stay strong.\" Adding, \"and they are lined up out the door to run kiosks in there, so you will see Blockbuster, or maybe Video Ezy kiosks flowing through there.\" But in the same interview he admitted, \"absolutely we will have less stores, but I don't want to do away with them because they form a valuable part of the business.\"\n\nIn November 2013, responding to Blockbuster US announcing they will shut all their domestic stores, \"SmartCompany\" compared Australian Bureau of Statistics figures from financial year 1999–2000 stating there were 1166 individual video hire businesses operating within Australia; compared to a 2013 IBISWorld study finding just 255 DVD rental businesses still operating in the country (a drop of almost 80%). The same study found the overall industry has declined at an annual rate of 14.8% over the five years to 2013. In addition to the obvious competition and threats to rental businesses, it also blamed recent developments from Pay TV and free-to-air television, both radically increasing their channel selections. Another impact stems from the reduced cost of DVD and Blu-ray discs, seeing the average 2013 price of a DVD settle at $16, compared to $20 in the early-2000s. This has acted as a double-edged sword for the industry, boosting the numbers of DVD sales, but also turning renters into buyers.\n\nSome Video Ezy stores were re branded as Network Video shops such as Network Video in Sandringham.\n\nVideo Ezy has stores in the following countries outside Australia:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39730769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39730769", "title": "Wild Westing", "text": "Wild Westing\n\nWild Westing was the term used by Native Americans for their performing with Buffalo Bill's Wild West and similar shows. Between 1887 and World War I, over 1,000 Native Americans went \"Wild Westing.\" Most were Oglala Lakota (\"Oskate Wicasa\") from their reservation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, the first Lakota people to perform in these shows. During a time when the Bureau of Indian Affairs was intent on promoting Native assimilation, Col. William Frederick Cody (\"Buffalo Bill\") used his influence with U.S. government officials to secure Native American performers for his Wild West. Col. Cody treated Native American employees as equals with white cowboys.\n\nWild Westers received good wages, transportation, housing, abundant food, and gifts of cash and clothing at the end of each season. Wild Westing was very popular with the Lakota people and benefited their families and communities. Wild Westing offered opportunity and hope during time when people believed Native Americans were a vanishing race whose only hope for survival was rapid cultural transformation. Americans and Europeans continue to have a great interest in Native peoples and enjoy modern Pow-wow culture, traditional Native Americans skills; horse culture, ceremonial dancing and cooking; and buying Native American art, music and crafts. First begun in Wild West shows, Pow-wow culture is popular with Native Americans throughout the United States and a source of tribal enterprise. Wild Westers still perform in movies, pow-wows, pageants and rodeos. Some Oglala Lakota people carry on family show business traditions from ancestors who first worked for Buffalo Bill and other Wild West shows.\n\nDuring the Progressive Era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was an explosion of public interest in Native American culture and imagery. Newspapers, dime-store novels, Wild West shows, and public exhibitions portrayed Native Americans as a \"vanishing race.\" Their numbers had decreased since the Indian Wars, and survivors were struggling with poverty and constraints on Indian reservations. American and European anthropologists, who represented a new field, historians, linguists, journalists, photographers, portraitists and early movie-makers believed they had to study western Native American peoples. Many researchers and artists lived on government reservations for extended periods to study Native Americans before they \"vanished.\" Their inspired effort heralded the \"Golden Age of the Wild West.\" Photographers included Gertrude Käsebier, Frank A. Rinehart, Edward Curtis, Jo Mora and John Nicholas Choate, while portraitists included Elbridge Ayer Burbank, Charles M. Russell and John Hauser.\n\nDuring the Progressive Era, U.S. government policy focused upon acquiring Indian lands, restricting cultural and religious practices and sending Native American children to boarding schools. Progressives agreed that the situation was serious and that something needed to be done to educate and acculturate Native Americans to white society, but they differed as to education models and speed of assimilation. Reformist progressives, a coalition led by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Society of American Indians and Christian organizations, promoted rapid assimilation of children through off-reservation Indian boarding schools and immersion in white culture.\n\nThe Society of American Indians was opposed to Wild West shows, theatrical troupes, circuses and most motion picture firms. The Society believed that theatrical shows were demoralizing and degrading to Indians, and discouraged Indians from \"Wild Westing.\" Chauncey Yellow Robe wrote that \"Indians should be protected from the curse of the Wild West show schemes, wherein the Indians have been led to the white man's poison cup and have become drunkards.\" \n\nReformist progressives believed Wild West shows exploited Native Americans and vigorously opposed theatrical portrayals of Native Americans as savages and vulgar stereotypes. From 1886 to the onset of World War I, reformist progressives fought a war of images with Wild West shows before public exhibitions at world fairs, expositions and parades portraying the model Carlisle Indian Industrial School as a new generation of Native Americans embracing civilization, education and industry.\n\nWild West shows were exceptionally popular in the United States and Europe. Here, the American and European public could see and hear some of the first Americans, not as curiosities, but a people with vibrant culture. In 1893, over two million patrons saw Buffalo Bill's Wild West perform during the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody launched his Wild West traveling show in 1883, and was so successful there were fifty copies in two years. Buffalo Bill toured the United States and Europe until his death in 1917. Wild West shows were \"dime novels come alive.\" Millions of Americans and Europeans enjoyed the imagery and adventure of historic reenactments of the Battle of Little Big Horn; demonstrations of Lakota horse culture and equestrian skills; archery, ceremonial dancing, cooking and music. Visitors could stroll through model Indian tipi \"villages\" and meet performers; available for purchase were crafts from women artisans, and autographed postcards, photographs and memorabilia from famous Wild Westers.\n\nBetween 1887 and World War I, over 1,000 Native Americans went \"Wild Westing\" with Buffalo Bill's Wild West. Most Wild Westers were Oglala Lakota from Pine Ridge, South Dakota, the first Lakota people to go Wild Westing.\n\nDuring a time when the Bureau of Indian Affairs was intent on promoting Native assimilation, Col. Cody used his influence with U.S. government officials to secure Native American performers for his Wild West. Buffalo Bill treated Native American employees as equals with white cowboys. Wild Westers received good wages, transportation, housing, abundant food, and gifts of cash and clothing from Buffalo Bill at the end of each season. Wild Westers were employed as performers, interpreters and recruiters. Men had money in their pockets and for their families on the reservation. Female performers were paid extra for infants and children, and supplemented wages by making and selling Lakota crafts.\n\nSobriety and good conduct was required. Performers agreed to refrain from all drinking, gambling and fighting, and to return to his or her reservation at the end of each seasonal tour. Shows hired venerable elder male Indians to appear in the parades to ensure that young men acted with appropriate behavior when visiting host communities, and rules were self-policed by traditional Oglala Lakota chiefs and former U.S. Army Indian Scouts.\n\nMost performers spent one or two seasons on the road; some Wild Westers became cowboys, stuntmen for films, artisans, musicians, educators, authors, movie actors and entrepreneurs. Chief Flying Hawk was a veteran of Wild West shows over 30 years, from about 1898 to 1930.\n\nWild Westing was very popular with the Lakota people and beneficial to their families and communities. It offered a path of opportunity during a time when people believed Native Americans were a vanishing race, whose only hope for survival was rapid cultural transformation. It offered a safe haven for Lakota leadership after the Sioux Wars and for famous Native American prisoners of war. The touring also offered freedom six months each year from the degrading confines of government reservations. Wild Westing was an act of passive resistance to oppressive Bureau of Indian Affairs policies.\n\nWild Westing was a means for the Lakota to preserve their culture and religion. Shows generally toured from late spring to late autumn, paralleling the traditional buffalo hunt season. In performance, the Lakota performed dances banned at the time on reservations. Lakota dancers in the present day credit Cody and the Wild Westers for preserving dances that were otherwise suppressed. The Lakota easily adapted to historical reenactments of the traditional practice of continually reenacting their history in dance and rituals. By this means, the exploits of the warriors were indelibly inscribed upon the collective consciousness of the \"oyate\", or nation. Wild Westers at times performed programs that dramatized the very battles, raids and massacres in which the men had participated as warriors.\n\nWild Westing allowed individuals to draw their own conclusions and make decisions about their own lives. It improved self-esteem and provided pleasure from performing for appreciative audiences. It offered adventure; performers traveled to the great cities of the world and freely associated with new cultures. Inter-marriage was not uncommon and many performers settled in Europe, some traveling with other shows and circuses. Between daily performances, Wild Westers played games such as ping pong and dominoes, which they had adopted during European tours.\n\nTraveling and performing was hard work, and rest and relaxation was important. Performers were permitted to freely travel by automobile or by train, for shopping, sightseeing, visiting friends, attending parties and gala events.\n\nWild westers educated the American and European public about Native American history and culture. The Wild Wester community was a diverse group, including U.S. Army Indian Scouts from the Great Sioux War; famous prisoners of war such as Lakota Chief Sitting Bull, Ghost Dancers Kicking Bear and Short Bull; Apache Chief Geronimo; Carlisle Indian School students Luther Standing Bear and Frank C. Goings; and Chiefs Iron Tail and Red Shirt, who became international celebrities. Chief Iron Tail was the most famous Native American of his day; a popular subject for professional photographers, he had his image circulated across the continents. Chief Red Shirt was popular with journalists and newspapers and was the most quoted Wild Wester celebrity. Early dime novels, Wild West shows and Golden Age photographers, portraitists and movie-makers created the theatrical image and portrayal of the Lakota people as the iconic American Indian mounted warrior. This popular perception in the United States and Europe was created by Lakota performers in their historic reenactments of the Sioux Wars; demonstrations of Lakota horse culture and equestrian skills; and ceremonial dancing, cooking and music.\n\nThe Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, was the flagship Indian boarding school in the United States from 1879 through 1918. Carlisle was the first Indian boarding school located far from the reservation, in an Eastern environment free of the West's anti-Indian prejudices and free from the influences of native cultures.\n\nCarlisle set the bar for 26 Bureau of Indian Affairs boarding schools in 15 states and territories and hundreds of private boarding schools sponsored by religious denominations. Over 10,000 Native American children from 140 tribes attended Carlisle. Tribes with the largest number of students included the Sioux, Chippewa, Seneca, Oneida, Cherokee, Apache, Cheyenne and Alaskan. Carlisle offered a path of opportunity and hope at a time when people believed Native Americans were a vanishing race whose only hope for survival was rapid cultural transformation.\n\nCarlisle was founded on principle that Native Americans are the equals of whites and that Native American children immersed in white culture would learn skills to advance in society. Carlisle evolved beyond an industrial trade school. Nearby historic Dickinson College provided Carlisle Indian School students with visiting professors, access to the Dickinson Preparatory School (\"Conway Hall\") and college level education. The Dickinson School of Law was another resource to the Carlisle Indian School and a number of Carlisle students attended. Students excelled at music, debating, journalism and sports, and were offered internships and a summer outing program living with white families and earning wages. The Carlisle Indian Band, Carlisle Cadets and Carlisle Indians football team earned national reputations. The Carlisle Indian Band performed at world fairs, expositions, parades and every national presidential inaugural celebration until the school closed. The Carlisle Cadets at arms marched in parades. The Carlisle Indians were a national football powerhouse in the early 20th century and competed and won games against Harvard, Pennsylvania, Cornell, Dartmouth, Yale, Princeton, Brown, and Army and Navy. During the program's 25 years, the Carlisle Indians compiled a 167–88–13 record and 0.647 winning percentage, the most successful defunct major college football program. In 1911, the Indians posted an 11–1 record, which included one of the greatest upsets in college football history. Legendary athlete Jim Thorpe and coach Pop Warner led the Carlisle Indians to an 18–15 upset of Harvard before 25,000 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Thorpe scored all the points for Carlisle, a touchdown, extra point and four field goals. \nAttending Carlisle is considered by some Native Americans like going to Yale, Princeton or Cambridge, and the family tradition of Carlisle alumni as \"Harvard style\" is one of pride and stories of opportunity and success. Carlisle was a unique school and produced a new generation of Native American leadership in the United States.\n\n Wild Westing and the Carlisle Indian School were portals to education, opportunity and hope, and came at a time when the Lakota people were impoverished, harassed and confined. Most Wild Westers were Oglala Lakota from Pine Ridge, South Dakota, the first Lakota people to go Wild Westing. Known as \"Show Indians\", Oglala Wild Westers referred to themselves as \"Oskate Wicasa\" or \"Show Man\", a title of great honor and respect. On March 31, 1887, Chief Blue Horse, Chief American Horse and Chief Red Shirt and their families boarded the \"S.S. State of Nebraska\" in New York City, led a journey for the Lakota people when they crossed the sea to England on Buffalo Bill's first international tour to perform at the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria and in Birmingham, Salford and London over a five–month period. The entourage consisted of 97 Indians, 18 buffaloes, 2 deer, 10 elk, 10 mules, 5 Texas steers, 4 donkeys, and 108 horses.\n\nSince 1887, Wild Westing has been a family tradition with several hundred Pine Ridge families. Between 1906 and 1915, 570 individuals from Pine Ridge went Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill and other shows. Often entire families worked together, and the tradition of the Wild Wester community is not unlike that of circus communities. Frank C. Goings, the recruiting agent for Buffalo Bill and other Wild West shows at Pine Ridge, was a Carlisle alumnus and Wild Wester with experience as a performer, interpreter and chaperone. Goings carefully chose the famous chiefs, the best dancers, the best singers, and the best riders; screened for performers willing to be away from home for extended periods of time; and coordinated travel, room and board. Travelling with his wife and children, and for many years toured Europe and the United States with Buffalo Bill's Wild West, Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Real West and the Sells Floto Circus.\n\nMany Oglala Lakota Wild Westers from Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota attended Carlisle. Carlisle Wild Westers were attracted by the adventure, pay and opportunity and were hired as performers, chaperons, interpreters and recruiters. Wild Westers from Pine Ridge enrolled their children at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School from its beginning in 1879 until its closure in 1918. In 1879, Oglala Lakota leaders Chief Blue Horse, Chief American Horse and Chief Red Shirt enrolled their children in the first class at Carlisle. They wanted their children to learn English, trade skills and white customs. \"Those first Sioux children who came to Carlisle could not have been happy there. But it was their only chance for a future.\" Luther Standing Bear was taught to be brave and unafraid to die, and left the reservation to attend Carlisle and do some brave deed to bring honor to his family. Standing Bear's father celebrated his son's brave act by inviting his friends to a gathering and gave away seven horses and all the goods in his dry goods store.\n\nDuring the Progressive Era, from the late 19th century until the onset of World War I, Native American performers were major draws and money-makers. Millions of visitors at world fairs, exhibitions and parades throughout the United States and Europe observed Native Americans portrayed as the vanishing race, exotic peoples and objects of modern comparative anthropology. Reformists Progressives and the Society of American Indians fought a war of words and images against popular Wild West shows at world fairs, expositions and parades and opposed theatrical portrayals of Wild Westers as vulgar heathen stereotypes. In contrast, Carlisle students were portrayed as a new generation of Native American leadership embracing civilization, education and industry. The fight for the image of the Native American began when Reformist Progressives pressured organizers to deny Buffalo Bill a place at the Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, Illinois. Instead, a feature of the Exposition was a model Indian school and an ethnological Indian village supported by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In style, Buffalo Bill established a fourteen-acre swath of land near the main entrance of the fair for \"Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World\" where he erected stands around an arena large enough to seat eighteen thousand spectators.\nSeventy-four Wild Westers from Pine Ridge, South Dakota, who had recently returned from a tour of Europe, were contracted to perform in the show. Cody also brought in an additional one hundred Wild Westers directly from Pine Ridge, Standing Rock and Rosebud reservations, who visited the Exposition at his expense and participated in the opening ceremonies. Over two million patrons saw Buffalo Bill's Wild West outside the Columbian Exposition, often mistaking the show as an integral part to the World's Fair.\n\nThe \"vanishing race\" theme was dramatized at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition of 1898 at Omaha, Nebraska, and The Pan-American Exposition of 1901 in Buffalo, New York. Exposition organizers assembled Wild Westers representing different tribes who portrayed Native Americans as a \"vanishing race\" at \"The Last Great Congress of the Red Man\", brought together for the first and last time, apparently to commiserate before they all vanished.\n\nThe Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904, known as the St. Louis World's Fair, was the last of the great fairs in the United States before World War I. Organizers wanted their exotic people to be interpreted by anthropologists in a modern scientific manner portraying contrasting images of Native Americans. A Congress of Indian Educators was convened and Oglala Lakota Chief Red Cloud and Chief Blue Horse, both eighty-three years old, and the best-known Native America orators at the St. Louis World's Fair, spoke to audiences. A model Indian School was placed on top on a hill so Indians below could see their future as portrayed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. On one side of the school, \"blanket Indians\", men or women who refused to relinquish their native dress and customs, demonstrated their artistry inside the school on one side of the hall. On the other side, Indian boarding school students displayed their achievements in reading, writing, music, dancing, trades and arts. The Carlisle Indian Band performed at the Pennsylvania state pavilion, and the Haskell Indian Band performed a mixture of classical, popular music and Wheelock's \"Aboriginal Suite\" which included Native dances and war whoops by band members.\n\n On March 4, 1905, Wild Westers and Carlisle students portrayed contrasting images of Native Americans at the First Inaugural Parade of Theodore Roosevelt. Six famous Native American Chiefs, Geronimo (Apache), Quanah Parker (Comanche), Buckskin Charlie (Ute), American Horse (Oglala Lakota), Hollow Horn Bear (Sicangu Lakota) and Little Plume (Blackfeet), met in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, to rehearse the parade with the Carlisle Cadets and Band. Theodore Roosevelt sat in the presidential box with his wife, daughter and other guests, and watched West Point cadets and the famed 7th Cavalry, Gen. George A. Custer's former unit that fought at the Battle of Little Bighorn, march down Pennsylvania Avenue. When the contingent of Wild Westers and the Carlisle Cadets and Band came into view, President Roosevelt waved his hat and all in the President's box rose to their feet to see the six famous Native American Chiefs adorned with face paint and elaborate feather headdresses, riding on horseback, followed by the 46-piece Carlisle Indian School Band and a brigade of 350 Carlisle Cadets at arms. Leading the group was Geronimo, in full Apache regalia, riding a horse also in war paint. It was reported that: \"The Chiefs created a sensation, eclipsing the intended symbolism of a formation of 350 uniformed Carlisle students led by a marching band,\" and \"all eyes were on the six chiefs, the cadets received passing mention in the newspapers and nobody bothered to photograph them.\"\n\nWild Westers still perform in movies, pow-wows, pageants and rodeos. Some Oglala Lakota people carry on family show business traditions from Carlisle alumni who worked for Buffalo Bill and other Wild West shows. Americans and Europeans continue to have a great interest in Native peoples and enjoy modern Pow-wow culture. First began in Wild West shows, Pow-wow culture is popular with Native American throughout the United States and a source of tribal enterprise. Americans and Europeans continue to enjoy traditional Native Americans skills; horse culture, ceremonial dancing and cooking; and buying Native American art, music and crafts. There are several on-going national projects that celebrate Wild Westers and Wild Westing.\n\nThe National Museum of American History's Photographic History Collection at the Smithsonian Institution preserves and displays Gertrude Käsebier's photographs, as well as many others by photographers who captured the displays of Wild Westing.\n\n"}
