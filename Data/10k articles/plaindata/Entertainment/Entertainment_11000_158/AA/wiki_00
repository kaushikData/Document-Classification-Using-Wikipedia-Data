{"id": "12362700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12362700", "title": "ABBA: The Movie", "text": "ABBA: The Movie\n\nABBA: The Movie is a 1977 documentary film about the Swedish pop group ABBA's Australian tour. It was directed by Lasse Hallström, who directed most of the group's videos. The film has become a cult film among ABBA fans. Its release coincided with the release of \"\", the group's fifth studio album, and features many songs from that album as well as many of their earlier hits, and one, \"Get on the Carousel\", unavailable anywhere else.\n\nThe film has a very thin plot which is no more than a vehicle to link together the concert footage. It concerns the adventures of Ashley Wallace (Robert Hughes), a naïve DJ on Radio 2TW, who normally presents a through-the-night country and western-themed show. In spite of this, he is sent by the station's boss (Bruce Barry) to get an in-depth interview (\"Not an interview, a \"dialogue\"\", demands his boss) with the group, which is to be aired on the day ABBA leave Australia. Needless to say, Ashley, who has never done an interview before, singularly fails, mainly because he has forgotten to pack his press card, although the fact that he is unable to buy a concert ticket doesn't help matters either. Armed with his trusty reel-to-reel tape recorder, Ashley is forced to follow the group all over Australia, beginning in Sydney, and then travelling, in order, to Perth, Adelaide, and Melbourne, experiencing repeated run-ins with the group's very protective bodyguard (Tom Oliver), as well as his increasingly exasperated boss. Throughout the movie, we see Ashley interviewing members of the public, asking them if and why they like ABBA. Almost all the comments are positive, but he interviews a man who is driven mad by his ABBA-obsessed twelve-year-old, and another girl who thinks ABBA are over the top.\n\nEventually, Ashley has an unbelievably lucky chance encounter with Stig Anderson, the group's manager, in the foyer of ABBA's hotel, who agrees to arrange an interview, and gives him tickets to that evening's concert. But Ashley sleeps in and misses the appointed interview time. Just as Ashley has given up hope (by this time, he doesn't even care that his press card—which has been constantly forwarded by Australia Post—has finally arrived), a miracle occurs: he steps into an elevator and finds himself face-to-face with ABBA. They agree to give him an interview there and then, and he leaves Melbourne just in time to meet the deadline for the radio show to go out on-air. He puts together the final edit in the back of a taxi on the way back from the airport, as ABBA depart Australia for Europe. With only minutes to go, Ashley makes it back to the radio station where, having set the tape up on the studio's playback machine, he relaxes at his control desk to listen as the interview is broadcast.\n\n\n\nHallström indicated that the film's script and plot concept was \"conceived on the plane on the way to Australia\". Initially, 16 mm film was to be used but producers upgraded the project to 35 mm Panavision technology.\n\nMostly filmed in Australia some additional scenes were filmed in ABBA's native Sweden (but still set in Australia)—noticeably different from Australia are the street signs and the traffic flowing on the right-hand side.\n\nMargaret Geddes of Australian newspaper \"The Age\" concluded that the film was \"slick, competent and even for the non-convert entertaining.\"\n\n\"ABBA: The Movie\" was first released in December 1977. The film was also presented in several Eastern Bloc nations, including the Soviet Union where it was screened at two movie houses in Moscow.\n\nTo date four releases of the film have been made: a single-disc DVD, a two-disc, special-edition DVD, a single-disc Blu-ray, and a now-defunct single-disc HD DVD. All releases above feature a restored print with bonus material. The initial DVD, including digital restoration, was released by SBS in Australia on 2 October 2005.\n\nA theatrical re-release of the film occurred across Europe during July and August 2008 (the same period as the ABBA-themed movie musical \"Mamma Mia!\" first hit American theaters) in the UK, Ireland, The Netherlands, Norway, Germany, and Austria.\n\n"}

{"id": "3516971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3516971", "title": "Abraham Whistler", "text": "Abraham Whistler\n\nAbraham Whistler is a fictional character appearing in Blade II American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is a vampire and the mentor of Blade. Screenwriter David S. Goyer created him for the 1998 film \"Blade\" (in which the part was played by Kris Kristofferson), but he first appeared on screen in \"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" where he was voiced by Malcolm McDowell and later by Oliver Muirhead. In 2006, Abraham Whistler appeared in the television show \"\".\n\nAbraham Whistler is a vampire hunter and the mentor of Blade. Abraham Whistler was once a happily married man with two daughters and a beautiful wife. He lived a normal life, and his family lived comfortably, but all of that changed one night when a drifter came, seeking dinner and place to rest for a while before continuing on his way. Whistler let the man in, only to regret that decision for the rest of his life. The drifter was a vampire, and a sadistic one at that. After torturing the family - mainly Whistler - for a while, he then tried to force Whistler to decide in which order his family would die. Whistler refused, struggling to stop the vampire from killing his wife and daughters. He was unable, and a few hours before dawn, the vampire left him with a damaged leg, other injuries, and the drained corpses of his family.\n\nWhistler dedicated himself to hunting down vampires, learning about their ways and customs, and shut himself off from the world. A few years after his family's death, he went to a bar, got drunk, and ended up sleeping with one of the locals. The next morning, he explained to her that he was on the run from a powerful organization, and she would be in danger if they found out she'd been involved with him. He left her with a name and took her number and address, just in case he needed to get in touch with her should something happen. The one night stand had a big consequence: A daughter, whom Whistler learned about not long after her birth. He almost panicked, forcing his one-time lover and daughter to move somewhere else and change their names. He was determined not to lose this new family to the vampires. Certain they were safe, Whistler then left them to fend for themselves after giving them a substantial amount of money he'd earned from stealing from the vampires and their familiars. He checked in on his new family so often but kept them largely ignorant.\n\nSeveral years later, Whistler met up with a young boy who he'd almost mistaken for a vampire - Eric Brooks, a half-vampire, half-human miracle. He took the Daywalker in, teaching him to use his powers and was able to create a serum to sate the bloodlust Eric suffered. The two of them became a team, Eric taking on the name Blade, and since then they have stayed together and fought the vampires as partners. In the recent years though, Whistler was diagnosed with lung cancer from his smoking, and he realized that without him, Blade would be alone. Determined Blade wouldn't have to fight the war on his own, Whistler secretly began forming a team of vampire hunters. Around the same time, Abigail Whistler showed up, having tracked down her father, determined to know who had left her and her mother alone while occasionally supporting them. Whistler reluctantly told her everything, only to have an even more determined girl on his hands - one that wanted to follow in his footsteps. Seeing it was useless to convince her otherwise, he put her on the team, thankful that she would at least have others with her and he would be able to check up on her.\n\nLater, Whistler was nearly beaten to death by Deacon Frost's goons and shot himself in an attempt to prevent resurrecting as a vampire. His suicide was in vain, though. He came back, only to be kidnapped by the vampires working for Eli Damaskinos, who saw Whistler as a great advantage over the Daywalker and someone who could prove useful. Kept as a prisoner and tortured regularly, Whistler was eventually saved by Blade and given a cure for the vampirism. Whistler wasn't happy about the temporary alliance between Blade and the vampires, and he sensed something between Blade and Nyssa. He also resented Scud but went along with Blade's plan.\n\nAbraham Whistler's background in the animated series is the same as that in the films, although he appears younger and with a much more kempt appearance than the cinematic interpretation of the character. Whistler was a vampire hunter who took on a young Blade and trained him in martial arts and as a vampire hunter. Blade, who was half-vampire himself, was given a serum developed by Whistler that would stop him from craving human plasma. When Blade hunted Morbius the Living Vampire, a young human student who was accidentally mutated into a vampire-like creature, Blade discovered the Neogenic Recombinator, which could transform humans into vampires. Whistler told him not to destroy it, as it could also be used to cure Blade of his vampirism. Morbius was eventually driven into hibernation.\n\nWhile Blade was hunting a vampire in Europe, Whistler was visited by the Black Cat, who was looking for help to cure Morbius. Whistler told her that the only way he knew to cure him would be to destroy him and gave her a weapon to do so, but she couldn't bring herself to do it.\n\nIn the first Blade film it is revealed that Whistler lost his wife and two daughters to an attack by a vampire who had arrived at their home posing as a drifter. Whistler was beaten and tortured, being forced to choose which one of his family died first. These events shaped his hatred of vampires and his mission to destroy as many as he could. Whistler is a weapons expert and master of several martial arts, having a part in creating many of Blade's weapons. When he discovered a thirteen-year-old Blade on the streets preying on the homeless, he took him under his wing. Realizing that he was half human and lacked a vampire's normal weaknesses with the exception of their thirst, he developed a serum to suppress Blade's vampiric lust for blood.\n\nDeacon Frost, an ambitious vampire whom Whistler and Blade had been tracking, located their base and attacked Whistler, causing him to be infected with vampirism. After informing Blade of Frost's plan to resurrect an ancient vampire god, Whistler then seemingly commits suicide, considering death a better fate than becoming a vampire. However, his death is not seen on camera; only the sound of a gun firing is heard.\n\nIt is revealed in the second \"Blade\" film that Whistler survived his suicide attempt to be kidnapped by another gang of vampires and taken to the Czech Republic. After killing all but one of the vampires responsible for his imprisonment, Blade frees him from suspended animation, taking him to Prague and injecting him with the \"cure\". During his time with them, he was repeatedly tortured to the point of death, healed, and then tortured again.\n\nBlade, Whistler, and Scud were summoned by the Shadow Council, ruled by overlord Eli Damaskinos, to eradicate the reaper threat. Reinhardt and Chupa (played by Matt Schulze), a friend of Priest who now wishes to kill Whistler to even the score with Blade, corner Whistler, and Chupa proceeds to savagely beat him. Reinhardt leaves the two. Whistler, to save himself, releases the reaper pheromones into the air. As Chupa is about to finish him off with a gun, reapers swarm the sewers and feed on Chupa, allowing Whistler to slip away. During his escape, Whistler is confronted by Jared Nomak, the original Reaper, who lets Whistler live to reveal the truth about the Reaper strain to Blade. When Blade and Whistler are captured by Damaskinos thanks to Scud's betrayal, Whistler manages to escape after Reinhardt underestimates him, rescuing the injured Blade and taking him to a vat of blood so that Blade can be restored to full health to stop Damaskinos's forces and Nomak.\n\nIn the , Blade is framed for the murder of several humans (who were in fact familiars being used as bait). Blade, now in the public eye and wanted by the FBI, is hunted down. In a raid on their new hideout, Whistler set the self-destruct mechanism and seemingly died in an explosion. He is not seen or heard of afterwards (although Drake took the form of Whistler when he attacked the Nightstalkers).\n\nWhistler fathered a daughter out of wedlock or before marriage. This was Abigail Whistler, who eventually tracked down her natural father when she came of age, and asked to be trained as a vampire hunter. Whistler trained her, although he trained her separately from Blade, who was totally unaware that Whistler had any protégés other than himself. Whistler also set up Abigail as the leader of one of the many Nightstalker units he had secretly founded. It is assumed that these units were set up because one man (or half-vampire) is not enough to destroy an entire species. Also, since Blade is not immortal (he will eventually die from old age if he is not killed in action first), Whistler did not want the war to die with him.\n\nIn \"\", which takes place after \"Blade: Trinity\", the writers go further into Whistler's background. In the episode \"\", viewers learn that Whistler got his trademark limp from a young Blade, who escaped his father's house and broke Whistler's leg in an attempt to flee. Blade's father called Whistler in at the urging of a helpful policeman, and Whistler tested him to learn that he was not a regular vampire. He asked Blade's father to give him the boy to use as a weapon against vampires, but Blade ran away before a decision was made. After Blade joined and turned a street gang called the \"Bad Bloods\", Whistler found him and killed several members of the gang before taking Blade under his wing.\n"}

His fictional 1995 memoir, published in English as \"Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood\", was debunked by Swiss journalist and writer Daniel Ganzfried in August 1998. The subsequent disclosure of Wilkomirski's fabrications sparked heated debate in the German and English-speaking world. Many critics argued that \"Fragments\" no longer had any literary value. Swiss historian and anti-Semitism expert Stefan Maechler later wrote, \"Once the professed interrelationship between the first-person narrator, the death-camp story he narrates, and historical reality are proved palpably false, what was a masterpiece becomes kitsch.\"\n\nIn 1995, Wilkomirski, a professional clarinettist and instrument maker living in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, published a memoir entitled \"Bruchstücke. Aus einer Kindheit 1939–1948\" (later published in English as \"Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood)\". In the book, he described what he claimed were his experiences as a child survivor of the Holocaust. The supposed memories of World War II are presented in a fractured manner and using simple language from the point of view of the narrator, an overwhelmed, very young Jewish child. His first memory is of a man being crushed by uniformed men against the wall of a house; the narrator is seemingly too young for a more precise recollection, but the reader is led to infer that this is his father. Later on, the narrator and his brother hide out in a farmhouse in Poland before being arrested and interned in two Nazi concentration camps, where he meets his dying mother for the last time. After his liberation from the death camps, he is brought to an orphanage in Kraków and, finally, to Switzerland where he lives for decades before being able to reconstruct his fragmented past.\n\nFirst published in German in 1995 by the Jüdischer Verlag (part of the highly respected Suhrkamp Verlag publishing house), \"Bruchstücke\" was soon translated into nine languages; an English translation by Carol Brown Janeway with the title \"Fragments\" appeared in 1996, published by Schocken. The book earned widespread critical admiration, most particularly in Switzerland and in the English-speaking countries, and won several awards, including the National Jewish Book Award in the United States, the Prix Memoire de la Shoah in France, and the \"Jewish Quarterly\" literary prize in Britain. The book sold well, but in contradiction to common belief it was not a bestseller. (Maechler, 2001a, pp. 111–28; Oels, 2004, pp. 376–79)\n\nWilkomirski was invited to participate in radio and television programs as a witness and expert, and was interviewed and videotaped by reputable archives. In his oral statements Wilkomirski elaborated on many aspects which remained unclear or unexplained. For example, he provided the names of the concentration camps in which he claimed to have been interned (Majdanek and Auschwitz), and added that he had been the victim of unbearable medical experiments. (Maechler, 2001a, pp. 22–83)\n\nIn August 1998, a Swiss journalist and writer named Daniel Ganzfried questioned the veracity of \"Fragments\" in an article published in the Swiss newsweekly \"Weltwoche\". Ganzfried argued that Wilkomirski knew the concentration camps \"only as a tourist\", and that, far from being born in Latvia, he was actually born Bruno Grosjean, an illegitimate child of an unmarried mother named Yvonne Grosjean from Biel in Switzerland. The boy had been sent to an orphanage in Adelboden, Switzerland, from which he was taken in by the Dössekkers, a wealthy and childless couple in Zurich who finally adopted him.\n\nWilkomirski became a cause célèbre in the English-speaking world, appearing on \"60 Minutes\" and the BBC and in Granta and \"The New Yorker\". He insisted that he was an authentic Holocaust survivor who had been secretly switched as a young boy with Bruno Grosjean upon his arrival in Switzerland. His supporters condemned Ganzfried, who, however, presented further evidence to support his theory. Wilkomirski could not verify his claims, but Ganzfried was also unable to prove his arguments conclusively. (Maechler, 2001a, pp. 129–64; Eskin, 2002, pp. 104–53)\n\nIn April 1999, Wilkomirski's literary agency commissioned the Zurich historian Stefan Maechler to investigate the accusations. The historian presented his findings to his client and to the nine publishers of \"Fragments\" in the autumn of that year. Maechler concluded that Ganzfried's allegations were correct, and that Wilkomirski's alleged autobiography was a fraud.\n\nMaechler described in detail in his report how Grosjean-Wilkomirski had developed his fictional life story step by step and over decades. Most fascinating was his discovery that Wilkomirski's alleged experiences in German-occupied Poland closely corresponded with real events of his factual childhood in Switzerland, to the point that he suggested the author rewrote and reframed his own experience in a complex manner, turning the occurrences of his real life into that of a child surviving the Holocaust.\n\nIt remained unclear to Maechler whether Grosjean-Wilkomirski had done this deliberately or if the writer actually believed what he had written, but he was skeptical that the writer was a \"cold, calculating crook\", as Ganzfried assumed. (Maechler, 2001b, pp. 67–69) Amongst other things, Maechler revealed that a Holocaust survivor Wilkomirski claimed to have known in the camps, a woman named Laura Grabowski, had been earlier unearthed as a fraud, and had previously used the name Lauren Stratford to write about alleged satanic ritual abuse — a story which itself had been debunked nearly a decade earlier.\n\nMaechler's first report was published in German in March 2000; the English edition appeared one year later (Maechler, 2001a) and included the original English translation of \"Fragments\" which had been withdrawn by the publisher after Maechler's report. Subsequently, the historian published two essays with additional findings and analysis (Maechler, 2001b, 2002), while Ganzfried (2002) published his own controversial version of the case (s. Oels, 2004; Maechler, 2002). Journalist Blake Eskin (2002) covered the affair. Prior to the exposure, Eskin wrote and told the story of Wilkomirski's trip to the US to become reunited with people he claimed to be distant family, of which Eskin was a part. This story was aired in act two of \"This American Life\" episode 82, \"Haunted\". The writer Elena Lappin published an extensive report in May 1999. She had become acquainted with Wilkomirski two years before, when the Jewish Quarterly awarded him its prize for nonfiction. At the time, she was editor of that English magazine. In the course of her research, she identified a number of contradictions in Wilkomirski's story and came to believe that \"Fragments\" was fiction. (Lappin 1999)\n\nIn addition, she reported that Wilkomirski's uncle, Max Grosjean, said that as children he and his sister Yvonne (Wilkomirski's biological mother) had been \"Verdingkinder\" (or \"earning children\")—in other words, that they had been part of the old Swiss institution of orphaned children working for families, with overtones of child slavery. Eskin's interest in Wilkomirski had its origins in genealogy: his family had ancestors in Riga and, initially, they believed that the author of \"Fragments\" could perhaps be a long-lost relative. In the same year (2002) the public prosecutor of the canton of Zurich announced that she found no evidence of criminal fraud. She added that a DNA test she had ordered had confirmed that Wilkomirski and Grosjean were the same person.\n\nThe disclosure of Wilkomirski's fabrications altered the status of his book. Many critics argued that \"Fragments\" no longer had any literary value. “Once the professed interrelationship between the first-person narrator, the death-camp story he narrates, and historical reality are proved palpably false, what was a masterpiece becomes kitsch” (Maechler, 2000, p. 281). But for a few scholars, even as a pseudomemoir, the merits of the work still remain. “Those merits reside in a ferocious vision, a powerful narrative, an accumulation of indelible images, and the unforgettable way in which a small child's voice is deployed in an unfeeling adult world, during the war and thereafter” (Zeitlin, 2003, p. 177, see also Suleiman, 2006, p. 170).\n\nThe Wilkomirski case was heatedly debated in Germany and in Switzerland as a textbook example of the contemporary treatment of the Holocaust and of the perils of using it for one's own causes. However, the affair transcends the specific context of the Holocaust (see e.g. Chambers, 2002; Gabriel, 2004; Langer, 2006; Maechler, 2001b; Oels, 2004; Suleiman, 2006; Wickman, 2007). Wilkomirski's case raises questions about the literary genre of autobiography, the aesthetics of a literary work's reception, oral history, witness testimony, memory research, trauma therapies, and the like. The case is discussed in great detail by psychologists Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson as an interesting case of self-inflicted false memories (Tavris and Aronson, 2007, pp. 82ff.)\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3424494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3424494", "title": "Broadcasting in the Soviet Union", "text": "Broadcasting in the Soviet Union\n\nBroadcasting in the Soviet Union was owned by the Soviet state, and was under its tight control and Soviet censorship. Through the development of satellites and SECAM, controlled broadcasting was initialized as the main frequency for distributing information and entertainment. Under the control of the Soviet Union, censorship and limitation on information was filtered for the citizens to ensure the common culture and socialist ideals were maintained.\n\nThe USSR State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting (; abbreviated as Gosteleradio SSSR <nowiki>[</nowiki><nowiki>]</nowiki> or simply Gosteleradio <nowiki>[</nowiki><nowiki>]</nowiki>), Soviet Union's governing body of broadcasting, was in charge both of television networks and radio stations. During this time of political propaganda and war, controlling the large and spread out population meant censorship and lock downs on the freedoms of public speaking. Soviet Russia did not tolerate \"a slip of the tongue.\"\n\nSize, geography, time, and censorship attributed many issues to the development of broadcasting. The Soviet Union's \"size\" caused several problems to overcome. The first was \"geography\"; the European area of the Soviet Union was typical East European. At its peak, almost 8,650,000 square miles of land mass belonged to the U.S.S.R. Then there were the mountains such as the Urals. There were also the taiga and steppes of the east and the north. Another problem was \"time\"; the Soviet Union encompassed 11 different time zones, and thus what would be shown at 18:00 in Moscow would be different from 18:00 in Frunze, Kirghizia. The population too was unevenly spread out, the overwhelming majority being west of the Urals. In addition, the Soviet Union also relayed their programming to other Warsaw Pact states. Each population was then characterized by different economic and cultural elements. There was exclusively agricultural regions or industrial regions, needing their own satellite systems from broadcasting services.\n\nAs a result, Soviet television and Soviet radio required ingenuity to overcome the aforementioned problems as well as to transmit programming to the Eastern bloc.\n\n\"With the entire apparatus of cultural and artistic practice under centralized control, and production across all media generated by one officially endorsed methodology, the Soviet leadership was in an ideal position to saturate the marketplace with their product. The nature of this product was complex and all-encompassing, and was marketed as a new form of civilization. In order for fundamental changes in behavior and massive transformation of the landscape to occur, the population had to be engaged and mobilized to adopt the ideology (and goals and vision) of the leadership as their own\" Broadcasting owned by the governing body ensured the right information and propaganda would be distributed in order to keep that vision intact.\n\nSoviet domestic stations broadcast on shortwave, MW, LW and VHF wavebands, though the majority of stations were on medium and long wave. Neither the transmission sites nor the frequencies of domestic FM, MW, LW or SW stations were ever disclosed, thus leaving listeners having to memorize the frequencies.\n\nThe Soviet Union used SECAM D (VHF) and K (UHF) (also known as CIS-SECAM). The Soviet Union also used the OIRT VHF band (the \"R\" channels ranging from chs. R1 to R12) and the pan-European/African UHF band.\n\nSECAM (Sequential Color with Memory) was initiated in 1956. Soviets involvement began with the NIR which was covered by the Nautchno-Issledovatelski research institute. \"Non-linear\" in which a process analogous to gamma correction is used and \"SECAM IV\" that omits this process were the standards utilized initially.\n\nThere were four national radio channels. The first was the \"All-Union First Programme\". It broadcast items of national interest along with local opt-out programmes in each of the Republics. The second channel was called \"Radio Mayak\" (\"Radio Beacon\" in Russian) and was a music and speech entertainment channel intended to be the \"beacon\" of Soviet culture, similar to BBC Radio 2 in the UK or Radio National in Australia. And the \"All-Union Third Programme\" carried the programme strands \"Radio Yunost\" and \"Radio Orfey\".\n\nMost people who have listened to shortwave are familiar with Radio Moscow, the main Soviet shortwave radio station. However, that's only part of the picture. Soviet radio also had Radio Station Peace and Progress, officially called the \"Voice of Soviet Public Opinion\". Most republics also had an external service, relayed by Radio Moscow's transmitters. Radio Moscow also relayed other radio stations from their satellite states, such as Radio Afghanistan.\n\nGenerally there were five channels (called \"programmes\" in the typical European fashion then). The first channel (\"1st Programme\") was the main channel. It was also the most adaptable for the republics to utilize (see \"Regional services\" below). Other channels were the \"All Union Programme\" (the second channel), the \"Moscow Programme\" (the third channel aimed mostly at Moscow), the \"Fourth Programme\" (the fourth channel) and the \"Leningrad Programme\" (the 5th channel aimed at Leningrad viewers).\n\nSoap operas and TV series of original cast were rare until the last decade; a notable example is \"Seventeen Moments of Spring\" which quickly became a cult film. It involved the exploits of Stierlitz, a Soviet super-spy in Nazi Germany, who inspired many jokes (see Russian humour). However, in the later years quite a few of soap operas were brought in from the West (United States, Brazil, etc.), and a number of detective series were cast locally.\n\nDuring this period, the state used programs, films, and animations to redraw its citizens to the Soviet culture and away from the western ideas that were brought home during the war. Short animations were introduced that negatively portrayed western culture ans reiterated the ideas of old Russia, such as The Stranger's Voice, which aired in 1949. Specifically, this segment targeted American Jazz, comparing it to a magpie's call. Comparing jazz and a magpie's lack of musical ability meant there was no true art as there was in Soviet music, and that this American music was all for show with no actual talent required.\n\nWith the initial release of filming worldwide, exciting American movies had almost no competition, which citizens of all classes in the Soviet State flocked into. In this period, external influences began to shape the union. from its initial introduction, the Soviet take on films opposed western. In its creation, its prime focus was to maintain the socialist ideals and culture. In most of these cases the films encompassed these socialists values through fact-based films and documentary footage montage with exciting story lines and stunts.\n\nIn addition to the national radio and television channels, each SSR and ASSR had its own state radio and television company or state broadcasting committees, although other regions were allowed regional state broadcasting companies/committees. Taking the Chechen-Ingush ASSR as an example, one would see that there was a lot of flexibility in the Soviet radio and television system.\n\nLike other areas of the Soviet Union, the four national television channels, Radio Mayak, the All-Union First and Third Programmes, and (if equipped with appropriate transmitters) Radio Moscow would be broadcast by either a Television and Radio Company of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic or by a State Committee on Radio and Television Broadcasting. However, in the First Programme (TV) and in the All-Union First Programme (radio), the Company/Committee was allowed to broadcast regional programming alongside the official First Programme/All-Union First Programme schedule. Depending on the political status of an administrative division, the Company/Committee would broadcast the regional programming in either Russian or the local language. In the Chechen-Ingush ASSR's case, the regional programmes would be broadcast in Russian, Chechen, or Ingush.\n\nThe Company/Committee would also broadcast additional channels for their coverage area only. Such cases were usually a second programme, known by a special name, in the main language of the SSR/ASSR. Other districts had their own local programming, and cities such as Moscow and Leningrad had special programs, broadcasting only in the evening and on FM.\n\nAside from Canada's ANIK satellite system and the U.S.'s satellite system, the Soviet Union had the largest domestic satellite system in the world. The Soviet Union time-shifted programmes in order to cover its 11 time zones. This involved several solutions to the Soviet Union's geography and time zone problems:\n\n\nThere were two types of timeshifting in the Soviet Union. The first was used by both the All-Union First Programme and the First Programme (TV). For simplicity, this system is denoted as the \"Radio/TV Orbita\" system (named after the editions of these 1st programmes when they are time-shifted). All other national television channels (the All-Union, Moscow, Fourth, Leningrad and Sixth Programmes), including Radio Mayak and the Third Programme, used the \"Double program\" composite time-shifting format.\n\n\nThe \"double program\" system was the other system used for time-shifting programmes. Like the \"Radio/TV Orbita\" system, identical content would be broadcast on the time-shifted versions, and, in the case of the Third Programme (radio), followed the same type of editions as the All-Union First Programme. However, it was different in that, especially on TV, it was a composite time-shifting system. This means that multiple services could be broadcast on the same edition and thus reduce the cost of broadcasting several different editions of the channels.\n\nEditions of the Third Programme (radio):\n\nComposite editions of the All-Union, Moscow, and Fourth Programmes (TV):\n\nThe Soviet Union set up the great space race that would lead to international technological, political, cultural, and scientific exploration. The Soviet domestic satellite system was also known as Orbita - in 1990 there were 90 Orbita satellites, supplying programming to 900 main transmitters and over 4,000 relay stations. The most famous Soviet satellites were the Molniya satellites; other satellite groups were the Gorizont, Ekran, and Stasionar satellites. With the right equipment, people outside the Soviet Union who used TVRO satellite television could receive Soviet television programming.\n\nSince the 1970s, Russia has implemented the newer \"geostationary orbit \"Horizont\"\" satellites utilized by the Russian Space Television system. New satellites are released into orbit as older versions deteriorate and new technology becomes available. Operated by the State Enterprise \"Kosmicheskaya Svyaz\" there was constant maintenance of satellites as well as revision, censorship, and management performed through this main facility. At its peak, the Soviet Space program, in competition with the United States, pushed for newer advancements and technologies, leading to the Space race.\n\nThe Soviet Union's radio news and television news was provided almost entirely by the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union, commonly known as TASS until 1991. Under the rule of Emperor Nikolai II, the first broadcasting system began in 1904, and evolved into TASS in 1925.\n\nTASS still exists today, transformed into the Information Telegraph Agency of Russia (ITAR-TASS). It occupies a Joseph Stalin-era building in Moscow, characterised by a bas-relief sculpture above the main entrance. However, much like its counterparts in cinema and the press, it has suffered since the break-up of Soviet Union. ITAR now broadcasts domestic news, while TASS reports the world news and events abroad.\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Soviet broadcasting landscape also changed. Instead of one uniform system for radio and television broadcasting, there are now multiple systems, one for each country. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the republics themselves. Below is an incomplete list of the changes to the television system in the republics, in alphabetical order:\n\n\"Broadcasters\": Radio Yerevan (radio), Public Television company of Armenia (TV)\n\n\"Main broadcasters\": Hayastani Azgain Radio (Armenian National Radio), Armenian National Television, Armenia TV\n\nBroadcasters: Radio Baku (radio), AzTV (TV)\n\nMain broadcaster: Azärbaycan Dövlät Teleradio Verilisläri Sirkäti (State Radio and Television Company of Azerbaijan)\n\n\"Broadcasters\": Radio Minsk (radio), Minskaja studija televidenija (TV)\n\nMain broadcaster: Nacyjanalnaja Dzjarzaúnaja Teleradyjokampanija Respubliki Belarus (State Television and Radio Company of Belarus)\n\nBroadcasters: Eesti Raadio (radio), Eesti Televisioon (TV)\n\nMain broadcasters: Eesti Raadio, Eesti Televisioon, Kanal 2, TV3 ViaSat\n\nBroadcasters: Radio Tbilisi (radio), Tbiliskaja studija televidenija (TV)\n\nMain broadcaster: Saqartvelos Teleradio Korporacia (Georgian National Broadcasting Corporation)\n\n1990\nBroadcaster: State Committee for Broadcasting and Television of the Republic of Tajikistan\n\n2005\nMain broadcaster: Tajik Radio\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19067812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19067812", "title": "CFL Football '99", "text": "CFL Football '99\n\nCFL Football '99 is a gridiron football video game developed by Victoria, British Columbia-based entrepreneur David Winter. It is an officially licensed product of the Canadian Football League and the Canadian Football League Players Association. The title is best known for being the only video game based on the CFL to date.\n\nDesigner David Winter originally specialized in administrative and industrial applications, doing business through his private firm Wintervalley Software. He obtained the rights to the CFL brand in 1998 and launched a new company, CDE (Canadian Digital Entertainment Inc.), for the purpose of marketing CFL Football '99. Part of the game's development was outsourced to American middleware provider Phantom Reality.\n\nCFL Football '99 was not a fast-paced, console-style title; rather, it was a simulation in the mold of Sierra's Front Page Sports Football franchise. Similar to the contemporary Front Page Sports Football, it mostly used 2D graphics.\n\nReception of the game was mixed. Casual players were disappointed as they were hoping for a more mainstream take on Canadian football. Simulation veterans were eager to recognize the game's potential, but most accepted the fact that it could not rival established names in the same subgenre.\n\nWinter started working on a second installment in his CFL series, this time using a 3D graphics engine. But over the course of development, he decided to broaden the game's scope by putting the emphasis on customization instead of the CFL licence. Official CFL content was scrapped in favor of more options: the game allowed the player to pick his own ruleset and field size from various gridiron football codes. In 2001, the project was rechristened Maximum Football and it eventually secured U.S. distribution.\n\nMaximum Football was released in 2006 after a protracted development cycle. In earlier press releases, the developer hinted that Maximum Football would kick-start a franchise of sports games with a common focus on flexibility and management, such as Maximum Hockey, Maximum Baseball, and Maximum Lacrosse. For logistic reasons, none of the planned spin-offs were released. However, Maximum Football 2.0 shipped in 2007 and maintains a dedicated fanbase. The game can still be played using Canadian football rules.\n\nA 2012 Kotaku article revealed that a team of Electronic Arts developers had prototyped a CFL conversion of EA Sports NCAA Football for internal purposes. Despite talks between Canadian-born EA executive Cam Weber and then-CFL commissioner Mark Cohon, the CFL mode never made it to any actual release.\n\nIn March 2016 it was announced that work had begun on a console based game called \"Canadian Football 2017\". Development started in early December 2015 and is scheduled for release on the Xbox One in June 2017 with other platforms to follow. The game is being developed with the Unity 5.5 game engine via Microsoft's Indiependent Development Program (which provides development kits and software licenses) and is supported by the Peterborough Innovation Cluster and Cube. The game will focus on Canadian rules football but its underlying design allows for quickly developing versions that use other rule sets.\n"}
{"id": "2486903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2486903", "title": "Chinlone", "text": "Chinlone\n\nChinlone (Burmese: ခြင်းလုံး), also known as caneball, is the traditional, national sport of Myanmar (Burma). It is non-competitive, with typically six people playing together as one team. The ball used is normally made from handwoven rattan, which sounds like a basket when hit. Similar to the game of hacky-sack, chinlone is played by individuals passing the ball between each other within a circle, without using their hands. However, in chinlone, the players are walking while passing the ball, with one player in the center of the circle. The point of the game is to keep the ball from hitting the ground, all the while passing it back and forth as creatively as possible. The sport of chinlone is played by men, women, and children, often together, interchangeably. Although very fast, chinlone is meant to be entertaining and fluid, as if it were more of a performance or dance.\n\nChinlone has played a prominent role in Myanmar for about 1,500 years. Its style is so performance-based because it was first created as a means of entertaining Burmese royalty. Chinlone is heavily influenced by traditional Burmese martial arts and dance, another reason as to why so much importance is placed upon technique. As it is such an old game, many variations have been made to it, including hundreds of different ways or moves to use when maneuvering the ball. In addition to the original form of chinlone, there is a single performance style. This form of chinlone is called \"tapandaing\". While chinlone had been widely considered by Europeans to more of a game than a sport, international interest in chinlone grew rapidly. By 1911, chinlone teams were performing in parts of Europe and Asia. As spectators of chinlone, Europeans deemed it to be merely a game of indigenous people, too effeminate to be considered a sport.\n\nAfter Myanmar's independence from British colonial rule in 1948, many British influences and cultural practices lingered, including British sports such as polo. Past British colonialism still weighed heavily upon Burmese life. From the 1960s and onward, there was a big governmental push for traditional and historical preservation. The premise was for cultural pride to be renewed. Myanmar needed traditions that were unique to Burmese culture, free from any colonial influence. Chinlone fit this role perfectly, playing a key part in establishing Myanmar nationalism. Myanmar began implementing physical education in schools, teaching children from a young age about traditional sports like chinlone, as a way to educate and pride them on their culture. This was a small yet effective way in reestablishing Burmese life after colonial rule. With this new found nationalism, chinlone was finally considered a real sport.\n\nThe head of the Burma Athletic Association, U Ah Yein, was ordered by Burmese government to write a rulebook for chinlone (1953). These rules forced chinlone into being more competitive, and the first official chinlone competition was held in Yangon that same year. In addition to providing chinlone with an official set of rules, U Ah Yein's chinlone rulebook claimed chinlone to be unique to Myanmar only, as the birthplace of the game. While chinlone does distinctively go back far into Burmese tradition, there are many similar sports closely related to it across many other Southeast Asian countries. These ball games are as follows: da cau (Vietnam), kator (Laos), sepak raga (Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Indonesia), sipa (Philippines), and takraw (Thailand).\n\nAnother notable aspect of chinlone is its significance in the 2013 Southeast Asian Games, hosted in Naypyidaw, Myanmar. After 44 years since the last time Myanmar hosted the games, in 1969, the 2013 games was the perfect chance for Myanmar to show the rest of the region how much they progressed and modernized. While Naypyidaw was still lacking many amenities, with the help of funds from the Chinese government, Myanmar pulled off the highly anticipated event. The closing ceremony featured chinlone as the face of Burmese culture, and chinlone was even included as a separate sport within the competition. This was controversial, since other countries could not adequately compete in a sport that is unique to only Myanmar. By the end of the 2013 Southeast Asian Games, Myanmar had successfully showcased its new modernity, with chinlone at the forefront.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1678346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1678346", "title": "Cine film", "text": "Cine film\n\nCiné film (sometimes \"Cine\", no acute accent) is the term commonly used in the UK to refer to the 9.5 mm, 16 mm, 8 mm and Super 8 motion picture film formats used for home movies. It is not normally used to refer to professional formats such as 35 mm or 70 mm film, and is incorrect if applied to any video format. In the US, \"movie film\" is the common informal term for all formats and \"motion picture film\" the formal one.\n\n\"Cine film\" literally means \"moving\" film; deriving from the Greek \"kine\" for motion; it also has roots in the Anglo-French word \"cinematograph\", meaning \"moving picture\".\n\nAlthough there had been earlier attempts, typically employing larger formats, the introduction of the 9.5 mm and 16 mm formats in the early 1920s finally succeeded in introducing the practice of showing rented \"play-at-home\" copies of professionally made films, which, in the case of feature-length films, were usually much shortened from the originals.\n\nMore significantly, these new cine film gauges were the first truly practical formats for making casual amateur \"home movies\" of vacation trips, family gatherings, and important events such as weddings. Amateur dramas and comedies were sometimes filmed, usually just for fun and without any aspiration to artistic merit. On occasion, professional filmmakers employed cine film for cost-saving reasons or to evoke a particular aesthetic effect.\n\nAmateur 16 mm film-making was an expensive hobby limited to the affluent. The 9.5 mm format made more efficient use of film and was not quite so costly. The 8 mm format, introduced in 1932, consumed only one-quarter as much film as 16 mm and finally made home movies a reasonably affordable luxury for the many. Eventually, the 16 mm format came to be used mostly for commercial, educational and industrial purposes as a cost-cutting, compact alternative to 35 mm film that produced an acceptably sharp and bright image on smaller screens.\n\nCine film, being commonly available, was used to record scientific data, such as observations of animal behaviour and human gait. In some cases, such as studies of fluid dynamics, recording was done onto cine film at higher speeds than those used in home movies.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Betamax and VHS home videocassette recorders were introduced. Color video cameras, previously beyond the financial reach of all but the richest amateurs, gradually became cheaper and smaller. Battery-powered camcorders combined the recorder and the camera into one portable and increasingly compact and affordable unit. By the early 1980s an hour of blank videotape cost no more than a three-minute 50-foot roll of 8 mm film with processing. The writing was on the wall for cine film as a mass market item, though even in the early 2010s all the film formats mentioned above are still supported with new film stock and processing, albeit only from a very few specialist suppliers.\n\nSince cine film is now an obsolete format, some companies offer a service whereby these films are converted to modern formats such as DVD, and hobbyists have devised ways of performing the transfer with do-it-yourself equipment.\n\n"}
{"id": "44749281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44749281", "title": "Creed (film)", "text": "Creed (film)\n\nCreed is a 2015 American sports drama film directed by Ryan Coogler and written by Coogler and Aaron Covington. Both a spin-off and sequel in the \"Rocky\" film series, the film stars Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Johnson Creed, Apollo Creed's son, with Sylvester Stallone reprising the role of Rocky Balboa. It also features Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rashad, Tony Bellew and Graham McTavish. The film reunites Jordan with \"Fruitvale Station\" writer-director Coogler, as well as Wood Harris, with whom Jordan had worked on \"The Wire\".\n\nFilming began in Liverpool on January 19, 2015, and later also took place in Philadelphia, Rocky's hometown. \"Creed\" was released in the United States on November 25, 2015, the 40th anniversary of the date of the opening scene in 1976's \"Rocky\". The seventh installment of the series and sequel to 2006's \"Rocky Balboa\", the film received acclaim from critics, who called it the best \"Rocky\" film in many years, and was chosen by National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2015. For his performance, Stallone was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, his first Oscar nomination since the original film. He also won the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor, Critics' Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. A sequel, titled \"Creed II\", was released in November 2018, directed by Steven Caple Jr.\n\nIn 1998, Adonis \"Donnie\" Johnson, the son of an extramarital lover of former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, is serving time in a Los Angeles youth detention center when Creed's widow, Mary Anne, visits and offers to take him in.\nIn 2015, Donnie resigns from the Smith Boardley Financial Group to pursue his dream of becoming a professional boxer. Mary Anne vehemently opposes his aspiration, remembering how her husband was killed in the ring by Ivan Drago thirty years ago. Donnie auditions at Los Angeles' elite Delphi Boxing Academy, managed by family friend Tony \"Little Duke\" Evers Jr., the son of Rocky's trainer Tony \"Duke\" Evers, but is turned down. Undaunted, Donnie travels to Philadelphia in hopes of getting in touch with his father's old friend and rival, former heavyweight champion, Rocky Balboa.\n\nDonnie meets Rocky at Rocky's Italian restaurant, Adrian's, named in honor of his deceased wife, and asks Rocky to become his trainer. Rocky is reluctant to return to boxing, having already made a one-off comeback at a very advanced age despite having suffered brain trauma during his career as a fighter. However, he eventually agrees. Donnie asks him about the \"secret third fight\" between him and Apollo just after Apollo helped Rocky regain the heavyweight title, and Rocky reveals that Apollo won. Donnie trains at the Front Street Gym, with several of Rocky's longtime friends as cornermen. He also finds a love interest in Bianca, an up-and-coming singer and songwriter.\n\nDonnie, now known as \"Hollywood Donnie\", defeats a local fighter, and word gets out that he is Creed's illegitimate son. Rocky receives a call from the handlers of world light heavyweight champion \"Pretty\" Ricky Conlan, who is being forced into retirement by an impending prison term. He offers to make Donnie his final challenger—provided that he change his name to Adonis Creed. Donnie balks at first, wanting to forge his own legacy. However, he eventually agrees.\n\nWhile helping Donnie train, Rocky learns he has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He is unwilling to undergo chemotherapy, remembering that it was not enough to save Adrian when she had ovarian cancer. His diagnosis and the fact that his best friend and brother-in-law Paulie Pennino—Adrian's brother—has now died in addition to Adrian, Apollo, and his old trainer, Mickey Goldmill, further force him to confront his own mortality. Seeing Rocky shaken, Donnie urges him to seek treatment.\n\nDonnie fights Conlan at Goodison Park in Conlan's hometown of Liverpool, and many parallels emerge between the bout that ensues and Apollo and Rocky's first fight forty years earlier. First, before entering the ring, Donnie receives a present from Mary Anne — new American flag trunks similar to the ones Apollo and later Rocky wore. Additionally, to the surprise of nearly everyone, Donnie gives Conlan all he can handle. Conlan knocks Donnie down, but Donnie recovers to knock Conlan down for the first time in his career. Donnie goes the distance, but Conlan wins on a split decision (just as Apollo retained his title by split decision against Rocky). However, Donnie has won the respect of Conlan and the crowd; as Max Kellerman puts it while calling the fight for HBO, \"Conlan won the fight, but Creed won the night.\" Conlan tells Donnie that he is the future of the light heavyweight division.\n\nThe film ends with Donnie and a frail but improving Rocky climbing the 72 steps outside the entrance of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\n\nA number of figures (real-life fighters and trainers) from the sport of boxing play roles in the film:\n\nLiev Schreiber voices an \"HBO 24/7\" announcer, while Michael Buffer cameos as himself serving as ring announcer. Other sports media personalities who appear include ESPN's Tony Kornheiser, Michael Wilbon, Hannah Storm, and Max Kellerman, and HBO Sports' boxing announcer Jim Lampley.\n\nArchive footage of Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed is used multiple times in the film.\n\nOn July 24, 2013, it was announced that MGM had signed on with \"Fruitvale Station\" director Ryan Coogler to direct a spin-off of \"Rocky\", a seventh film in the \"Rocky\" series, which Coogler would also co-write with Aaron Covington. Sylvester Stallone also worked on the screenplay for the seventh film. The film would focus on a man following in the footsteps of his late father, Apollo Creed, and getting a mentor in the now-retired Rocky Balboa. Michael B. Jordan was set for the role of Creed's son, Adonis Creed, and Stallone was set to reprise his character of Rocky. Original producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff would produce, along with Stallone and Kevin King-Templeton. On April 25, 2014, while talking to \"THR\", Coogler stated that he had sent his latest draft to the studio, and confirmed the involvement of Jordan and Stallone.\n\nOn November 10, real-life boxers Tony Bellew and Andre Ward joined the film, with Bellew to play a fighter, \"Pretty\" Ricky Conlan, the main opponent for Creed. Shooting was set to begin in January 2015, in Las Vegas and Philadelphia. On December 16, Tessa Thompson was added to the cast as the female lead. On January 8, 2015, Phylicia Rashad reportedly joined the film to play Mary Anne Creed, Apollo's widow. On January 21, Graham McTavish tweeted about his involvement in the film.\n\nPrincipal photography began on January 19, 2015 on location at Goodison Park, with the first scene shot taking place during a Barclays Premier League football match between Everton (of which Stallone and native Evertonian Bellew are fans) and West Bromwich Albion. Goodison would later host both the climactic film fight between Donnie and Conlan and also Bellew's real-life title fight against Ilunga Makabu in May 2016, which was the first outdoor boxing match in Liverpool since 1949.\n\nFilming also took place in Philadelphia. In early February, an empty store in Philadelphia was converted into a boxing gym, where some training scenes were shot.\n\nOn February 13, the crew was spotted filming in the Victor Cafe in South Philadelphia. The cafe was transformed into the \"Adrian's Restaurant\", and crew were again spotted filming there on February 16. Stallone and Jordan were also spotted on the set of the film on February 18. From February 24–27 and then on March 3, filming took place at Sun Center Studios in Aston Township.\n\nThe musical score for \"Creed\" was written by Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson, who is only the third composer in the history of the \"Rocky\" series, following Bill Conti (\"Rocky\", \"II\", \"III\", \"V\", and \"Balboa\") and Vince DiCola (\"Rocky IV\"). \"Creed\" also features a soundtrack that consists mostly of music new to the series, including hip hop tracks by artists such as Future, Meek Mill, and White Dave. Both a score and a soundtrack album were released on November 20, 2015 by WaterTower Music and Atlantic Records, respectively. One tribute to Conti's original soundtrack is included – the track \"You're a Creed\" uses both \"Gonna Fly Now\" and \"Going the Distance\".\n\nOn February 3, 2015, Warner Bros. slated the film to be released domestically on November 25, 2015. This date coincides with the 40th anniversary of the opening scene in the original film, where Rocky fights Spider Rico.\n\nOn December 20, 2015, screeners of numerous prospective awards contenders, including \"Creed\", were uploaded to torrent sites. The FBI has linked the case to co-CEO Andrew Kosove of Alcon Entertainment. Kosove claimed that he had \"never seen this DVD\", and that \"it never touched his hands\".\n\n\"Creed\" grossed $109.8 million in North America and $63.8 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $173.6 million, against a budget of $35 million.\n\nIn North America, \"Creed\" opened on Wednesday, November 25, 2015, alongside \"The Good Dinosaur\" and \"Victor Frankenstein\", as well as the expanding wide releases of \"Brooklyn\", \"Spotlight\" and \"Trumbo\". The film was originally projected to gross $35 million from 3,404 theaters in its first five days, including $20 million in its opening weekend. However, after grossing $1.4 million from its Tuesday night previews (a record for a Thanksgiving week release) and $6 million on its opening day, five-day projections were increased to $39–42 million. The film ended up grossing $42.6 million in its first five days, including $30.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing third at the box office.\n\n\"Creed\" has received critical acclaim. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 95% based on 273 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Creed\" brings the \"Rocky\" franchise off the mat for a surprisingly effective seventh round that extends the boxer's saga in interesting new directions while staying true to its classic predecessors' roots.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an overall positive score of 85%.\n\n\"A.V. Wire\"s Herman Dhaliwal gave the film a very positive review, writing, \"I will say the film was everything I could have ever wanted and then some. It's a film that could have gone so wrong in so many ways so easily, but the results show something that is genuine and inspired. It takes the smartest possible routes with the story it wants to tell and delivers in basically every way it needed to. Ryan Coogler cements himself as one of the best rising filmmakers working today, as he crafts an emotional, funny, compelling and uplifting film that is full of strong performances.\" Andrew Barker of \"Variety\" stated that the film lives up to the expectation of its predecessors, while forging its own unique path. He also appreciated the performances of Stallone and Jordan, saying that Stallone deserved credit for taking a chance on young director Coogler, and that his trust had paid off. He concluded that the director \"offered a smart, kinetic, exhilaratingly well-crafted piece of mainstream filmmaking\". IGN reviewer John Lasser gave the film an 8.5 out of 10, saying, \"\"Creed\" is a mirror of Rocky's story and we have all been watching that unfold on the big screen for decades. Coogler's film does nothing to break the mold. Rather, it shows that the mold exists for a reason. Jordan delivers a knockout performance, and Stallone does as well. In the end, we can all only hope that we'll get to see Adonis on screen for just as long as we've seen Rocky.\"\n\nIn January 2016, Sylvester Stallone and MGM CEO Gary Barber confirmed that a sequel to \"Creed\" was in development. That same month, Stallone posed the possibility of seeing Milo Ventimiglia appear in the sequel, reprising his role as Rocky's son Robert Balboa from \"Rocky Balboa\". Ventimiglia previously revealed during the development of \"Creed\" that he was open to returning to the franchise, stating, \"I'll tell you what, if they invited me, I'd love to be there. If they didn't, I wouldn't be offended.\"\n\nAlso that month, it was reported that the sequel's release was tentatively set for November 2017, although it was later pushed back to an unconfirmed date. Development was seemingly delayed by the announcement Coogler had cast Michael B. Jordan in his next film, Marvel's \"Black Panther\", thus delaying production until both men's schedules permitted.\n\nA confrontation between Adonis Creed and Ivan Drago was hinted at on Instagram. Stallone later confirmed that he had finished writing the script for the sequel, which would see Dolph Lundgren reprising his role as Ivan Drago from \"Rocky IV\". By October 2017, Stallone stated on his social media page that he would direct the film, however, by December of the same year, Steven Caple Jr. was announced as the director of \"Creed II\". Boxer Florian Munteanu was cast as Drago's son. In an interview on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", Jordan confirmed that \"Creed II\" was his next project.\n\n\n"}

It is directed by Ramona de Sáa.\n\nThe school dates back to the Ballet School of the Sociedad Pro-Arte Musical de La Habana, founded in 1931, where the prima ballerina assoluta, Alicia Alonso her former husband Fernando Alonso and his brother Alberto received their earliest ballet classes. In 1961, state-sponsored education began with the creation of the Alejo Carpentier Provincial School of Ballet (\"Escuela Nacional de Ballet Alejo Carpentier\"). The following year, the National School of Ballet was created as part of the National School of Art. The fundamental characteristic of this teaching institution is in its formation, sustained in the methodology of the Cuban school of ballet. Like all the Cuban educational systems, the education of the ballet in the country is free.\n\nThe school was able to accommodate 900 students until the president Fidel Castro, who, in a visit to the school, suggested the idea of new studio space. After some proposals, he decided to raise the number of students from 900 to more than 4,000 children and adolescents. Director of the school, Ramona de Sáa recalls: \"quickly we started doing the study: how many students per classroom, how many professors... and in a few days we were delivering the project to the president for the new social order of the school.\"\n\nIn 2002 the expansion allowed the program to begin the work to select 4,050 students out of the 52,000 that were interested. Professionals from the \"National Ballet of Cuba\", the \"Superior Institute of Art\" and the \"Elementary School of Ballet\" divided into 35 teams to select the students that would attend the school.\n\nMany of the school's alumni are eminent professionals, recognized in Cuba and internationally.

{"id": "34360857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34360857", "title": "Dead Space (mobile game)", "text": "Dead Space (mobile game)\n\nDead Space is a science fiction survival horror third-person shooter video game developed by Australian company IronMonkey Studios and published by Electronic Arts for iOS, BlackBerry Tablet OS, Xperia Play, Android and BlackBerry 10 devices. The game was also scheduled for release on Windows Phone 8 as part of a deal with Nokia that saw several EA games released exclusively on Nokia branded Windows Phones, but it was cancelled prior to release.\n\nWithin the \"Dead Space\" series, the game is set after the events of the original \"Dead Space\", but prior to the events of \"Dead Space 2\" and shows how the Necromorph outbreak spread from the government to public sectors.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to that of the original \"Dead Space\" game, with most changes centering on adapting the game to play with touchscreen controls. Players slide their thumbs on either side of the screen to simulate the dual analog movement scheme of the original; movement on the left of the screen moves the character, movement on the right moves the camera. Players tilt the device to rotate the weapon's alignment. Players can move and explore freely, interact with objects, collect items and currency, and buy upgrades in much the same fashion as the original game. To reload, the player taps the weapon, and contextual swipes upwards or downwards are occasionally necessary. To fire, the player taps the screen to aim, and taps the screen again to shoot.\n\nThe Xperia Play version has slightly different controls insofar as it utilizes the slide-out game pad, complete with \"touch-pad\" controls, with the left and right triggers used for aiming and firing respectively.\n\nIn \"Dead Space\", the player controls a figure code-named Vandal, a newly converted Unitologist, on a mission in the mines of Titan Station, orbiting Saturn. Vandal is directed over a headset to destroy a series of power boxes, thus cutting off communications to certain parts of the station. After doing so, however, Vandal is attacked by a group of Necromorphs and forced to flee towards a tram system. On the way there, the head of Unitology, Daina Le Guin, tells Vandal that destroying the power boxes has released a Necromorph infestation onto the station and that Vandal's death, and the deaths of all the miners, will be a glorious event. Disgusted, Vandal decides to reveal the Unitologists' plans to the government, as they are quite clearly insane. Meanwhile, the station's director, Hans Tiedemann, contacts Vandal and orders the restoration of all quarantine seals. After doing so, Vandal is contacted by Tyler Radikov, a Unitologist contact, who swears that Le Guin duped him too, and that he had no idea what Vandal's real mission was. Radikov promises to guide Vandal in escaping.\n\nUnder the direction of Tiedemann and Radikov, Vandal sets out to lock down the doors to the Public Sector. Radikov says that in order to do so, Vandal must shut off the power to the seals, as this will trigger all emergency seals to engage. Vandal does so, but discovers that Radikov has been lying, and in fact has provided instructions that result in the opening of all Public Sector doors, leaving the section without any defense against the Necromorphs. A furious Tiedemann demands that Vandal try to shut down the core of the station, as it is overheating, and is in danger of destroying the entire station.\n\nWhen Vandal reaches the core, it becomes apparent that a large Necromorph is \"suffocating\" it. Vandal defeats the creature, but falls into the core with it. A badly injured Vandal manages to crawl out of the core, at which point it is revealed that Vandal is a female, Karrie Norton. She tries to radio Director Tiedemann for help, leaving an audio log relating what has happened. The game ends with Radikov telling Le Guin that the Necromorph outbreak was a success. Back at the core, a trail of blood leads off-screen, with only Vandal's helmet remaining; her fate is unknown.\n\nUpon release, \"Dead Space\" received very positive reviews. The iOS version holds aggregate scores of 88 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on twenty-two reviews, and 91.67% on GameRankings, based on six reviews. The game won \"Best Mobile Game\" (2011) at the Meffy Awards and \"iPad Game of the Year\" (2011) at the App Store Rewind.\n\nReviews emphasized the extent to which the title replicated the look and feel of the \"Dead Space\" series within the limitations of a mobile touchscreen device, whilst also praising the fact that the game was a new story, not simply a port of the original \"Dead Space\" game.\n\nAppSpy's Andrew Nesvadba was extremely impressed, scoring it 5 out of 5 and writing, \"\"Dead Space\" is a chilling experience that goes well beyond the normal expectations for mobile gaming.\" TouchArcade's Brad Nicholson also scored it 5 out of 5. He was critical of the controls and the combat system, but concluded that \"\"Dead Space\" is worth a download based on its production values alone. The team has successfully created a very, very dark title bolstered by a rich atmosphere that oozes everything you want out of a solid horror game.\" TouchGen's Matt Dunn also scored it 5 out of 5. He was slightly critical of the controls, but commented that \"literally the only negative aspect of the game involves some control inaccuracy.\" He praised the sound design and graphics and concluded that \"\"Dead Space\" is the best action game I've ever played on an iOS device. It's the first time I've felt like a mobile version of a game has had as much developer love put into it as its console counterpart. We've seen decent ports, and good mobile counterparts to console games, but never a game that looks and feels this close to the original [...] This isn't a cash grab or a cheap port, this is a brand new \"Dead Space\" experience.\"\n\nBlake Grundman of 148Apps was equally impressed, scoring the game 4.5 out of 5, and writing \"it is staggering to imagine that such a huge experience could be contained within the constraints of the iPhone, but not only does it succeed, it sets a benchmark that could be nigh impossible to match any time soon,\" and referring to the control scheme as \"shockingly well constructed.\" He concluded, \"To say that \"Dead Space\" is one of the best games that we have seen in 2011 doesn't do it justice. This is one of the most immersive experiences available on the platform. You owe it to yourself to discover that an iOS game can in fact make you shudder in fear and want to jump out of your skin. It isn't merely a game, it is an experience that all iOS gamers should partake in.\"\n\nIGN's Levi Buchanan, scoring the game 8.5 out of 10, made a similar point; \"\"Dead Space\" is not a cop-out, shoehorned experience – it's a real-deal chapter in the \"Dead Space\" franchise that fits right in with the console games even though it takes a slightly different tack by de-emphasizing shock-jumps and laying on action scene after action scene. But that just means EA understands the differences (and, yes, limitations) of the iDevices. \"Dead Space\" has good controls, great visuals, and a fun story. It may repeat itself a little too much, but the blood-soaked ride never feels bloated.\"\n\nDestructoid's Jim Sterling scored the game 8 out of 10. Although he was somewhat critical of the controls, he was impressed with how genuine a \"Dead Space\" experience the game offered; \"\"Dead Space\" for the iDevices is no mere cash-in. Rather than go the easy route with an on-rails shooter or a selection of banal minigames, Electronic Arts and IronMonkey Studios have instead opted to cram a genuine third-person \"Dead Space\" experience into your iPhone. The weird thing is it more or less \"works\" [...] it really is impressive just how authentic a \"Dead Space\" experience has been crafted, and the generally high caliber of the game could at least justify an XBLA/PSN port.\" Eurogamer's Kritan Reed also scored the game 8 out of 10, writing \"This all-new \"Dead Space\" is surprisingly faithful to the full-fat versions in every sense. Before you recoil in horror at the thought of another borked touch-screen attempt at twin-stick action-adventuring, \"Dead Space\" is far more entertaining than it has any right to be. It not only captures the intricate, moody visual signature of Visceral's originals with stunning efficiency, but manages to faithfully translate the gameplay.\" Pocket Gamer's Tracy Erickson also scored it 8 out of 10, giving it a \"Silver Award\". He was critical of the controls but concluded that \"its presentation, well-constructed levels, and tense combat situations are enough to see you through, even if the controls won't.\"\n"}

The concert was organised by Take That singer-songwriter Gary Barlow and was part of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.\n\nThe Diamond Jubilee Concert followed two concerts held at the palace for the Queen's Golden Jubilee a decade earlier – the classical themed Prom at the Palace and the pop/rock themed Party at the Palace.\n\nThe concert was partially attended by the Queen, who arrived at 9pm, but not by Prince Philip who had been taken to hospital with a bladder infection earlier in the day. Prince Charles and other members of the royal family attended the whole concert.\n\nGary Barlow and the BBC spent six months planning the concert and 10,000 free tickets for the concert were made available to the public, with applications possible, by post or online, between 7 February and 2 March 2012. After the application period closed, successful applicants were then drawn by random ballot. A total of 1.2 million applications were eventually received, 240 for every available pair. Non-ticketed attendees could watch the concert on giant TV screens in the Mall and local Parks. Estimates of these free attendees range from 250,000 to 500,000 people.\n\nThe concert took place on bank holiday Monday 4 June as part of the extended weekend celebrations for the Diamond Jubilee, which ran from 2 to 5 June. The acts performed on a specially constructed stage, with a canopy, around the Queen Victoria Memorial, in front of the palace. The stage was designed by Mark Fisher.\n\nThe house band, led by Mike Stevens, who was also the Musical Director of the concert, consisted largely of the Take That/Gary Barlow band, a few extra musicians and the BBC Concert Orchestra. Tom Jones, Elton John, Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney brought their own bands to the concert.\n\nGary Barlow and Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the jubilee entitled \"Sing\" which was performed for the first time at the concert by a choir from many Commonwealth countries. The song draws inspiration from the music and people of the Commonwealth. Its creation was the subject of a one-hour BBC documentary broadcast on 3 June 2012 by BBC One.\n\nConcert ticket holders were given access to the palace gardens for an afternoon picnic before the main event. They were served cold hampers with a British themed menu specially designed by Heston Blumenthal and the royal chef Mark Flanagan.\n\nThe running order was:\n\n\n\nThe concert was broadcast live on BBC One, BBC One HD and BBC Radio 2. American broadcaster ABC showed highlights the following day after as \"Concert For The Queen: A Diamond Jubilee Celebration With Katie Couric\" as well as an encore airing on 9 June. Broadcasting unions announced in April 2012 that they would ballot their members over taking strike action due to an ongoing pay dispute with the BBC, leading to media speculation that the BBC coverage of the concert could be affected. It was later confirmed that the BBC's coverage wouldn't be affected by any strikes. It aired on 5 June on CBC television in Canada. BBC Entertainment showed the concert on 8 June in Latin America.\n\nThe concert aired from 19:30 until approximately 23:00 UK time.

{"id": "3782069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3782069", "title": "Digital rhetoric", "text": "Digital rhetoric\n\nDigital rhetoric is a way of informing, persuading, and inspiring action in an audience through digital media. It is an advancing form of communication composed, created, and distributed through multimedia platforms. Rhetoric combines multiple methods such as persuasion, effective writing, and effective speaking to present information in inventive ways. The meaning of rhetoric has changed over time, developing with changes in technologies. Online media are increasingly used as communication and information platforms, and since more text is placed online, there is more opportunity for persuasion through innovative and creative means. Because of this shift in rhetoric, the relationship between writers and readers has changed in form, communication style, and effectiveness. Digital rhetoric is advancing and changing how people choose to communicate their ideas with broader audiences. Both rhetoric and digital rhetoric hold various meanings and definitions depending upon who is looking at it; for example, the online journal \"Harlot of the Arts\" holds a competition through Twitter for people to define rhetoric, and the submissions are extremely varied.\n\nThe term digital rhetoric was coined by rhetorician Richard A. Lanham in his 1993 essay collection, \"The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts\". In 2009, rhetorician Elizabeth Losh offered this four-part definition of digital rhetoric in her book, \"Virtualpolitik\":\n\n\nLosh's definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric is a heterodoxical field, one that relies on different methods to study various permutations of information: as code, as text, as visuals, as videos, and so on.\n\nThough influenced by Lanham and Losh, Douglas Eyman also offers a definition of digital rhetoric in his 2015 book \"Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice\": “... the application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or heuristic for production) to digital texts and performances”. Eyman’s definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric can be applied in two ways: 1) as an analytic method, digital rhetoric can be used to analyze a digital text, and 2) as a heuristic for production. It offers rhetorical questions that a composer can use to create digital texts.\n\nEyman locates the emerging field of digital rhetoric as interdisciplinary in nature, enriched by related fields such as, but not limited to: digital literacy, visual rhetoric, new media, human-computer interaction and critical code studies.\n\nAs the power of technology grows, so too do the uses and scope of digital rhetoric. This includes schools offering online classes and test-taking, online news sources including scholarly journals and online editions of newspapers, and people searching for information online rather than consult a more traditional means such as an encyclopedia. Teachers can use podcasts, YouTube videos, and social media sites like Facebook and LinkedIn to facilitate discussions and increase students' interest in a topic. In addition, they can make use of distance learning modules, as a form of online teaching. In academia, online journals allow for information to be more accessible due to the use of digital rhetoric. Writers also have more opportunities to write in various formats instead of a traditional linear format. In social media, people come into contact with digital rhetoric on a daily basis whether it be an updated Facebook status, a 140 character tweet, or even the use of visual rhetoric on websites such as Instagram. Social media is being used universally to allow for people to connect from all places. The choice of one's rhetoric can influence and alter other peoples opinions and thoughts on certain subjects impacting the ideology of collective identity vs. individual identities. This scope of influence that digital rhetoric obtains can also be seen in commercial branding and politics.\n\nThe urge for digital rhetoric to be introduced to classrooms is the fact that in the era of Web 2.0, quite a proportion of school managements and instructors stick to the traditional rhetoric and resist the pervasiveness of technology. For the first time, the knowledge taught at and the methods employed by the academia are far behind the social and cultural advancement, rather than leading it. As Clark (2010) argues, \"...the traditional essayistic literacy ... needs to be replaced by an intentional pedagogy of digital rhetoric that emphasizes the civic importance of education...\".\n\nIn universities, courses on digital rhetoric are taught at the graduate and undergraduate level as courses in English, Communication, and Media Studies departments. Courses in digital rhetoric study the interactions between users and digital texts, as well as how different backgrounds such as age, ethnicity, gender and more can affect these interactions. By studying digital rhetoric in this way, students are able to better understand the uses and purpose of digital rhetoric in the modern world.\n\nScholars like Jeff Grabill contribute to the use of digital rhetoric by pushing for its use in the classroom. Grabill embraces the age of technology and encourages his contemporaries to do so as well. His backgrounds in English, education, and technology and work in those fields make him a gateway between the scholarly field of digital rhetoric and its implementation. Another scholar, Cheryl Ball, specializes in areas that consist of multimodal composition and editing practices, digital media scholarship, and digital publishing. She also focuses on university writing pedagogy. Ball teaches people to write and compose multimodal texts by analyzing rhetorical options and choosing the most appropriate genres, technologies, media, and modes for a particular situation. During her own education, Ball made significant advances in the digital rhetoric field by completing her school's first electronic and interactive thesis. She also received tenure at another university using the first all-digital tenure portfolio. For her undergraduate course, Clark created and employed a set of practices, including ePortfolios, digital stories, online games, \"Second Life,\" and blogs. In doing so, she managed to \"engage(s) students in the interactivity, collaboration, ownership, authority, and malleability of texts\". In another approach, Douglas Eyman recommends a course in web authoring and design that provides undergraduates more practical instruction in the production and rhetorical understanding of digital texts. Moreover, he explains that web authoring and design for digital rhetoric instruction provides opportunities for students to learn fundamentals of web writing and design conventions, rules and procedures. Attention to multimodality has  also influenced \"Understanding Rhetoric: A Graphic Guide to Writing\" by Elizabeth Losh and Alexander Jonathan, which emphasized engaging the comic form of literacy.\n\nDigital rhetoric pedagogy has been further developed in the secondary level of education due to support at the university level. This allows for students to create and edit projects simultaneously through the internet. Collaboration is seen as one of the biggest advantages to digital rhetoric, as it gives students and teachers the ability to collaborate and critique anywhere anytime. By being educated in various forms of technology, students are exposed to a more multimodal world and teachers foster a more well-rounded learning environment. Through digital writing, students have a broader choice of composing to fit their needs. Students can have people see their work anywhere, which reflects the accessibility of social media that students are used to in their everyday lives.\n\nThe increase in digitalization of media has amplified the importance of digital rhetoric in politics as it has introduced a new relationship between politicians and the citizenry. Digital communication platforms and social networking sites (SNS) are means of allowing citizens to share information and engage in debate with other people of similar or distinct political ideologies. The topics and ideas communicated through digital rhetoric have been shown to influence and predict the political behavior of individuals outside the digital world. Politicians have been known to use digital rhetoric as a tool to communicate information to the citizens. Likewise, digital rhetoric has enabled increasing political participation. Theoretical political research on digital rhetoric has attributed to the increase of political participation to three models; these include the motivation model, learning model, and attitude model. In 2008, the first wide scale political campaign through Twitter was utilized by President Obama. This success is measured in the over half a billion dollars raised through the internet. This use of social media has become a large asset for all political candidates and is currently utilized by all. The 2016 elections brought social media to the forefront and all presidential candidates utilized different forms of persuasion in their 140 character tweets.\n\n\nSocial media incorporates numerous characteristics of interactions between people in the public sphere. Social media is not characterized as an ideal public sphere because it fails to provide equitable access to information and participation for women and minority groups. Nevertheless, social media has shown to be useful in the propagation of digital rhetoric for political campaigns as shown in Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns in which digital rhetoric made its first successful appearance at a U.S presidential election — which marked a guideline for future elections. The presence of digital media companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Twitter has been well established in the promotion of digital rhetoric for political purposes. These firms have influenced the political process by providing strategic information about people demographics, behaviors, attitudes, and interests, all of which have increased the efficiency of political discourse — especially for political campaigns. In 2013, Twitter released a manual targeted towards politicians that outlined the main features of their platform and how they can be used to increase political communications. In 2018, Facebook devoted $62,500 dollars to create a space for politicians to learn ways in which they can use digital rhetoric in Facebook to increase the impact of there campaigns. Steir conducted a study to analyze the different types of rhetoric that took place in social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter; during the 2013 election campaign for the German Bundestag, he found that the types of information that politicians share on both platforms varied — Facebook was found to be the preferred medium for campaign rhetoric while Twitter was mostly utilized for rhetoric regarding political debates, infrastructure discussions, and law and order.\n\nDonald Trump often lacks factual references and has bombastic language that leads to a heavy emphasis on emotional rhetoric. Majority of his tweets lack factual basis that can withstand empirical verification. If taken a position the language used is vague and abstract. Nearly a quarter of Trump's tweets are Ad Hominem. Mostly, utilizing pathos Trump's twitter is now a major play in the world of politics.\n\nBernie Sanders uses Twitter in response to political events, issues, or fact. 82% of Sanders tweets state a position. Through these position-based tweets he also makes claim of \"values\" of himself, his political party, or Americans. While values are not a truth, they are considered a pseudo-truth. These blend together the strong uses of logos as well as pathos.\n\nHillary Clinton's tweets are mainly driven by facts, logos. This increases the validation through empirical means. Her tweets are written with direct reference to evidence or concrete situation. However, can contain ambiguous language that makes the merit of degree of truth less clear. Clinton also lacks emotive language in her messages, sticking only to the facts.\n\nJeb Bush employs rhetoric that is mainly fact oriented, with occasional ambiguity. Bush mostly Tweets with ethos through pseudo-concepts. Unlike other candidates, he makes moral statements. Bush's rhetoric mixes logos, pathos, and ethos.\n\nDigital media has increased its domination of the political sphere, especially with social media. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have become a significant part of the political engagement process with regard to elections, campaigns, or elected officials trying to connect with their constituencies. Social media globalizes communication. Especially political communication, fostering discussions and connecting communities as it reaches a significant amount of people. Amidst all of these outlets, Twitter is the form of social media that’s primarily used by candidates running for public office, elected officials, and government agencies.\n\n\nMembers of Congress use Twitter, and other forms of social media, to connect with their constituency. Members use social media to convey their stances on important issues, bills they have sponsored or have positions on. They use it to post about events they are hosting and the work they do in Congress. This includes meetings with constituents in Washington and back in their districts. According to former Congressman George Miller, Twitter is a mechanism to answer questions from people in his district. Conversely, Representative John Culberson said he uses Twitter to assist people in engaging themselves in their government. Many of these sites provide features for people to connect with their elected officials. For example, on Facebook the Town Hall feature connects users with their federal, and state officials. According to PEW Research center 20% of people who use social media have taken advantage of the fact that they can connect very easily with their officials by a simple “like” or “follow.”\n\n\nSocial media has a significant influence on political campaigns. The use of social media helps both candidates and constituents connect with one another. During the 2016 election cycle, candidates would post 5-7 times and would tweet 11-12 times a day.\n\nFor candidates, Facebook brings publicity and enables them to communicate effectively to the voters. This information has become very valuable for candidates. One super Political Action Committee that was anti-Trump, spent $9.9 million dollars in digital media. For candidates, social media provides them with a platform to highlight their ideas, and curate what they would like voters to see. According to the PEW research center, 35% of users of social media have taken advantage of sites like Facebook, in getting out to vote. Therefore, it has become a valuable tool for candidates. In the 2012 reelection campaign for President Obama, the campaign used over 15 different methods of social media. This was to reach out to a broader audience. Social media provides a mechanism for candidates to directly engage with society and potential voters. In Romania, during the elections for Mayor in a town called Bacau only 3/10 candidates used Facebook in 2012. In 2016 all of the candidates engaged in the use of social media and Facebook.\n\nSocial media also provided candidates with an insight into predicting the outcome of votes, which are more accurate than normal polling methods. Social media is a tool for campaigns as it provides an analysis as to the political climate, as well as the levels of engagement.\n\nFor potential voters, social media is a way to get information. According to the PEW research center, 44% of the voting population surveyed used social media as a way to get information about the 2016 election. This was significantly more than print newspapers at the local and national level. Furthermore, 24% of those surveyed claimed that they directly got information about the election at the national level from the two candidates; Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton.\n\nRhetoric is defined as the art of discourse, and is the root of digital rhetoric. As technology has changed, so have rhetorical situations. While the five canons of rhetoric developed for oratory print still apply, they are reconfigured to work in new contextual forms like the database, the hypertext, the cybertext, and other born-digital texts. Invention, arrangement, and style take on new meanings while delivery is elevated to new importance, and memory comes to refer to textual forms like search engines, archives, and tags. Although the rhetorical canon of delivery once referred to the oral/aural and bodily aspects of delivery, in the age of digital rhetoric, it refers to \"Internet-based communication\", and the mediums that are used. While the study of digital rhetoric is not specific to any one technology or era of technology, ideas in digital rhetoric do evolve alongside new technologies such as smartphones, new and easy to use composing platforms like Storify, Pixorial and WeVideo, and techniques such as Ajax. Ideas evolve as technology evolves, because one way of studying digital rhetoric is to trace the ways that the affordances and constraints of technology \"support and enable the transformation of the old rhetoric of persuasion into a new digital rhetoric that encourages self-expression, participation, and creative collaboration\". Many trace the transformation of old rhetoric into digital rhetoric through the classical rhetorical canons.\n\nDennis Baron states, \"The first writing technology was writing itself.\" While previous writing technologies involved pencils and hieroglyphics, the evolution of communication technology now allows for online and immediate rhetorical conversations. The evolution of communicative technologies started with the chisel, then the book, the quill, the Greek alphabet, and the pencil, onto more modern technology such as the computer. The origins of modern computing are to be found in the techno-military context of World War II. Just as the pencil was originally intended as a marking utensil for builders and is now used for writing, the computer was originally intended to compute advanced math problems, but is now used for word-processing and a myriad of other tasks. Technology continues to modify itself to meet the needs of people; in the case of digital rhetoric, technology has become more prevalent to match people's usage of the Internet and computers, which creates a technoculture. \nAnother scholar who highlights the changing landscape from print to digital is Jay Bolter. He argues that the computer is the most significant development since the start of the alphabetic/print tradition and that digital texts will continue to move print to the \"margins of literate culture.\"\n\nIn the digital age most everything is considered appropriation. Scholars pull their information from a myriad of sources and are constantly redefining terms in order to apply them to the digital world. Appropriation carries both positive and negative connotations. In some ways appropriation is a tool that can be used for the reapplication of outdated ideas to make them better. In other ways appropriation is seen as a threat to creative and cultural identities. Social media receives the bulk of this scrutiny due to the lack of education of its users. Most \"contributors are often unaware of what they are contributing. which perpetuates the negative connotation. Many scholars in digital rhetoric explore this topic and its effects on society such as Jessica Reyman, Amy Hea, and Johndan Johnson-Eilola.\n\nJames E. Porter defines avatar as a \"virtual body\". With developments in technology, there are new ways to present oneself online. This online presentation of one's own identity is an avatar. While scholars such as Beth Kolko hoped for an online world without physical barriers, making it a \"realm of ideas\", there are still social issues, such as gender discrimination and racism. Beth E. Kolko believes that an idealistic online world would be a \"realm of ideas\", without definitive factors such as gender, race, or age. Kolko argues that a non-gendered online world would not garner enough attention, because individuals could not relate to each other without gender identity. Victoria Woolums found in a study of the video game World of Warcraft that the gender identity of the avatar affected behaviors of other characters, showing a bias even in a realm where gender identity of an avatar may not be physically accurate to its user.\n\nCirculation theorizes the ways that texts and discourses move through time and space. Any kind of media can be circulated. Henry Jenkins \"sticky vs. spreadable media\" applies to circulation. Essentially, \"sticky\" media is media that can be spread. \nA new form of communication is composed, created, and distributed through digital technologies. Explained by Henry Jenkins, there is a shift from distribution to circulation which signals a move toward an increasingly participatory model of culture in which people shape, share, reframe and remix media content in ways not previously possible within the traditional rhetorical elements like print.\n\n\"A number of scholars have seen delivery in networked systems as circulation of digital texts, following John Trimbur's (2000) argument that circulation should be re-introduced in writing instruction; however, his definition of circulation is as an element or result of delivery. Trimbur suggests that neglecting delivery has led writing teachers to equate the activity of composing with writing itself and to miss altogether the complex delivery systems through which writing circulates. By privileging composing as the main site of instruction, the teaching of writing has taken up what Karl Marx calls a \"one-sided\" view of production and thereby has largely erased the cycle that links the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of writing. This cycle of interlocked moments is what Marx calls circulation. (190)\"\n\nCollaboration in digital rhetoric does not mean a co-authorship directly, even though this could be constituted as that as well, but collaboration looks more like an outlet that scholars can share their work and receive feedback as well. Instead of using solely the individual and their work, scholars use each other to spur on each other's ideas and build their concepts upon another. Collaboration takes on a much more broad meaning in terms of content on the internet. Not only does it offer the opportunity for scholars to collaborate with each other, but it also gives readers the chance to share their reactions with creators of content on the internet. In this way, digital rhetoric allows the audience to interact and work with creators of content. In Braun's book \"Cultivating Ecologies for Digital Media Work: The case of English studies\", she suggests a collaborative work by interdisciplinary scholars. \"This is scholarship\", a digital article published in Kairos 12.3, is the example of collaborative multimedia text by Catherine Braun as a rhetorician and compositionist, and Kenneth Gilbert as an audio-technician. The shared authorship from this work is shown in the editorial process including writing, digital production, display, and design to produce a final piece of a scholarly article in the form of webtext.\n\nDaren Brabham defines Crowdsourcing as, \"using an online, ... model to leverage the collective intelligence of online communities to serve specific organizational goals.\" As a concept within digital rhetoric, it is a utilization of modern technology to collaborate and create collectively. Companies and organizations use crowdsourcing to build creativity, by acquiring information other than what their immediate employees know. However, there are several concerns that come up when crowdsourcing tactics are used. Issues relating to Intellectual Property and Copyright are some of the foremost problems when crowdsourced ideas are used for commercial problems. Because the business did not conceive the idea, terms of use must be clearly set while fielding responses. Ethical concerns have been raised as well when engaging in crowdsourcing without a clear set of compensation practices or protections in place to secure personal information.\n\nFor the general scholar, the term delivery means the way in which a form of information is conveyed to a particular audience or group of people. These ideas of delivery could mean hearing information spoken at a conference or reading the newspaper. The forms can range from podcasts to videos, pictures to text, or even songs and newspapers. Delivery is the modem in which information is given in order for the topic to be best understood and related to. The term \"delivery\" is often aligned with the term \"performance\". The Forest of Rhetoric states that delivery is not only the fifth canon of rhetoric, but it is also a translation of the word \"hypokrisis\", or \"acting\". This Greek word was translated into delivery in the standpoint of spoken or recited information rather than newspapers or essays. Performance of plays, speeches, skits, etc. turns into the delivery of information in the piece being performed or spoken. This is the same as a piece of literature or rhetoric delivering its information through word choice, layout, and structure.\n\nElectracy is a term developed by Gregory Ulmer describing the emerging digital age. Electracy is often discussed as being in transition, advancing along with digital rhetoric. Electracy explains the full communicative potentials of new electronic media. Electracy is embedded in the approach of digital rhetoric and covers a large paradigm of literacy which is enhanced through Ulmer's idea of 'electracy'. The recent decades observes a sound effect of 'electracy' in the field of digital media. According to Arrayo, \"Participatory Compositions begins by exploring the apparatus of electracy in many of its manifestation while focus on the participatory practices found in online video culture. As research suggests the concept of 'electracy' has changed through the very idea of Ulmer who once articulated in the orientation of analogue video that serves rhetorical dimension of  'Teletheory'. But his vision of 'electracy' changed by bringing in a more broader literary concept that enterprise writing—coding, hypertext etc.\n\n\"Kairos,\" in the traditional rhetorical canon, is defined as catching the opportune moment. Traditionally, Kairos relates to rhetorical time (versus Kronos, or chronological time). It relates to the occasion and context when a text is written or a speech is given. In other words, Kairos refers to the elements of a speech that acknowledge and draw support from the particular setting, time, and place when and where a speech occurs. It is imperative that the speaker knows when and where to place the argument and, if it is appropriate. However, in the digital age, this is changing. Although Aristotle considers Kairos as related to ethos, pathos, and logos, a more modern definition expands that view to include multimodal texts. Sheridan, Ridolfo, and Michel offer an expanded definition of Kairos that asks rhetors to consider the ramifications of circulation, production and re-production, and distribution of compositions. Kairos has been put on the rhetorical back burner, but has become more theorized in the digital age to discuss the ecology of multimodal texts. Digital scholars like Douglas Eyman, Jim Ridolfo, David Sheridan, Anthony Michel, Ellen Cushman, and Isabel Pedersen are on the forefront of reviving the concept of Kairos and applying its use in the classroom.\n\n\"At first, Memory seemed to have to do solely with mnemonics (memory aids) that would assist a budding orator in retaining his speech. However, it clearly had to do with more than simply learning how to memorize an already composed speech for re-presentation. The practice of storing up information or other material arrived at through the topics of invention can be called for in a given occasion in order to redistribute information that is already known or given. The canon of Memory also suggests that scholars consider the psychological aspects of preparing to communicate and the performance of communicating itself, especially in an oral or impromptu setting. Typically Memory has to do only with the orator, but invites consideration of how the audience will retain things in mind.\"\n\nMind sharing is a way to get collective intelligence—crowd wisdom that is comparable to expert wisdom. The methodology for this is simple. One would look for a consensus from the crowd—the answer that most minds are suggesting is the best answer. If it's a numeric question (like guessing the weight of an ox), it's a calculated average or median. If it's an open question (like \"what car should I buy?\"), it's the most common answer.\n\nMultimodality means having several modes, modalities, or maxima—in simpler terms, it is a form of communication that uses multiple methods (or modes) to inform audiences of an idea. It can involve a mix of written text, pictures, audio, or videos. Online journals often embrace multimodality in their issues and articles by publishing works that use more than just written text to communicate the message. While the digital turn in rhetoric and composition has encouraged more discussion, theorization, and pedagogical application of multimodality and multimodal texts, the history of the field demonstrates a continuous concern with multimodal communication beginning with classical rhetoric's concern with delivery, gesture, and memory. All writing and all communication is, theoretically, multimodal.\n\nRemix is a method of digital rhetoric that manipulates and transforms an original work to convey a new message. The usage of remix can help the creator make an argument by connecting seemingly unrelated ideas into a convincing whole. As modern technology develops, self-publication sites like YouTube, SoundCloud, and WordPress have stimulated remix culture, allowing for easier creation and dissemination of reworked content. Unlike appropriation, which is the use and potential recontextualization of existing material without significant modification, remix is defined in \"Kairos\" as \"the process of taking old pieces of text, images, sounds, and video and stitching them together to form a new product.\" A popular example of remixing is the creation and sharing of memes.\n\nRhetorical velocity is the concept of authors writing in a way in which they are able to predict how their work might be recomposed. With the advancement of technology, there is no limit to the speed and distance at which an author's work is able to travel. Therefore, it is important for them to be able to predict how their audience will recompose their works. Jim Ridolfo and Danielle DeVoss first coined this idea in 2009 when they describe rhetorical velocity as \"a conscious rhetorical concern for distance, travel, speed, and time, pertaining specifically to theorizing instances of strategic appropriation by a third party\".\n\nVisual rhetoric relates to digital rhetoric because they can act together to communicate ideas in a way that is not bound by a linear format. Mary Hocks, a visual rhetoric scholar, states \"the screen itself is a tablet that combines words, interfaces, icons, and pictures that invoke other modalities like touch and sound\". By manipulating the tools described by Hocks, a writer in the digital world has access to influence a broader audience, and an influx of modes to communicate their ideas. This in turn creates a way for writers to communicate The use of visual images in rhetoric allows for a writer to convey an idea that may be so abstract that the written linear word will not suffice. Abstract ideas in rhetorical images, as Charles Hill states, that not only are abstract ideas represented in images acceptable but they are prominent, images \"do not necessarily have to portray an object, or even a class of objects, that exists or ever did exist\". Images allow for the writer to depict the closest representation of their thought possible since they can blend abstract and tangible thoughts. Hill uses the peace sign, swastika, and the confederate flags as examples of abstract ideas represented by images. Ironically the image of a peace sign, which seems to be universally accepted as a call from the 1970s 'hippie' movement, originated as an anti-Christian symbol. The original graphic was used to show an upside down broken cross symbolizing the despair of man and the crucifixion of the Apostle Peter. This shows how visual images can change over time and be adapted in such powerful ways that it actually changes the meaning completely. Images are versatile, and coupled with the motive of the author can provide key components to an argument. By being informed on how visual rhetoric interacts with its different components a reader/viewer can reduce abstract ideas to a more tangible state.\n\nReferred to as the digital divide, issues of economic access and user-level access are recurring issues in digital rhetoric. These issues show up most prevalent in computers and writing circles. Access can refer to inequality in the access of information, access to a reading public, and access to means of communicating. For those that teach digital rhetoric in schools and universities, student access to technologies at home and in school is an operative concern. There is some debate about whether mobile computing devices like smartphones make technology access more equitable.\n\nCopyright controversies in online and digital texts affect the way digital rhetoric is utilized. Many of these arguments deal with the problem of cost for the publishers and consumers of scholarly text. Copyrighting materials is an expensive task, especially when the materials can be translated into many other forms of digital sources that are freely found by the public. Because of this ease of transformation, copyright laws are undermined as scholars lose predication in their online materials through maneuvers as simple as copy and paste or translating hyperlinks. In James P. Zappen's piece \"Digital Rhetoric: Toward an Integrated Theory\", he refers to transferring material in ways that create misapplication of a work that a scholar has written. \"A media database, for example, can produce an almost infinite variety of end-user objects, which can be customized for different users, manipulated through hyperlinks, periodically updated, and scaled upon demand.\" Zappen's statement of \"infinite\" is in no way subjective or an over statement. Many digital pieces are infringed upon, stolen, or misused by the avoidance of copyright. These many forms of copyright avoidance lend to the controversy of digital rhetoric and media as a whole. \n\nOne controversy that has been steady on the rise since the transition of utilizing digital rhetoric in social media is Cyberbullying. An example can be seen in the TLC television series, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. Viewers have the opportunity to post their opinions and responses on sites such as Twitter and Instagram. The trend that people posting about the characters and their lifestyles, it reinforces the iconography of stereotypes (such as \"hillbillies\") is successful because of the way in which the rhetoric of difference is a naturalized component of the ethnic and racial identity. The challenge with social media is that since there is a limited amount of characters to convey the message the digital rhetoric tends to be oversimplified and stereotypes flourish. Erika Sparby evaluated that due to the increase of social media users people have found this stronger sense of confidence from the ability from being anonymous and using pseudonymous in digital social media for them to address either someone or something in a negative light.\n\nThere is controversy regarding the innovative nature of digital rhetoric. Arguments opposed to legitimizing webtext are Platonically-based in that they reject the new form of scholarship, web text, and praise the old form, print, in the same way that oral communication was originally favored over written communication. Originally some traditionalists didn't regard online open-access journals with the same legitimacy as print journals for this reason; however, digital arenas have become the primary place for disseminating academic information in many areas of scholarship. Modern scholars struggle to \"claim academic legitimacy\" in these new media forms, as the tendency of pedagogy is to write about a subject rather than actively work in it. Within the past decade, more scholarly texts have been openly accessible, which provides an innovative way for students to gain access to textual materials online for free, in the way that many scholarly journals like \"Kairos\", \"Harlot of the Arts\", and \"Enculturation\" are already available through open access.\n\nOpen access has removed the barriers of fees associated with accessing a work and restrictions of copyright and licensing. The matter of eliminating fees is most prevalent to digital rhetoric, because it allows for more access to works. Open access and digital rhetoric do not eliminate copyright, but eliminates restrictions by giving authors the choice to maintain their right to copy and distribute their materials however they choose, or they may turn the rights over to a specific journal. Digital rhetoric involves works that are found online and open access is allowing more people to be able to reach these works.\n\n"}

These were cathode ray tubes (CRT) that stored information written to them using an analog technique inherent in the CRT and based upon the secondary emission of electrons from the phosphor screen itself. The resulting image was visible in the continuously glowing patterns on the face of the CRT.\n\nDVBST technology was anticipated by Andrew Haeff of the US Naval Research Laboratory, and by Williams and Kilburn in the late 1940s. Tek's (Tektronix) Robert H. Anderson refined Haeff's concepts in the late 1950s to produce a reliable and simple DVST.\n\nThe DVBST implements two electron guns: a \"flood gun\" and a \"writing gun\". The writing gun scans across a wire grid, charging the grid to create the negative image. The flood gun then floods the grid. Previously charged areas repel the incoming electrons so that electrons only pass through the grid to the phosphor in those areas not previously charged.\n\nThe technology offered several advantages and disadvantages.\n\n\n\nTektronix-made DVBSTs were used for analog oscilloscopes (first in the 564 oscilloscope, then the type 601 monitor (1968), the 611 monitor, the 7313 and 7514 plug-in mainframe oscilloscope, all from Tektronix) and for computer terminals such as the archetypal Tek 4010 and its several successors including the Tektronix 4014. Portions of the screen are individually written-to by a conventional electron beam gun, and \"flooded\" by a wide, low velocity electron gun. Erasure required erasing the entire screen in a bright flash of green light, leading to the nickname \"the mean green flashin' machine\".\n\nSome DVBST implementations also allowed the \"write-through\" of a small amount of dynamically refreshed, non-stored data. This allowed the display of cursors, graphic elements under construction, and the like on computer terminals.\n\nAnother version of a (non-Tekronix) DVBST was the \"dark trace\" CRT, also known as the Skiatron. This CRT replaced the conventional light-emitting \"phosphor\" layer on the face of the tube screen with a \"scotophor\" such as potassium chloride (KCl). KCl has the property that when a crystal is struck by an electron beam, that spot would change from translucent white to a dark magenta color. By backlighting such a CRT with a white or green circular fluorescent lamp, the resulting image would appear as black information against a green background or as magenta information against a white background. A benefit, aside from the semi-permanent storage of the displayed image, is that the brightness of the resultant display is only limited by the illumination source and optics.\n\nThe image would be retained until erased by flooding the scotophor with a high-intensity infrared light or by electro-thermal heating. Using conventional deflection and raster formation circuity, a bi-level image could be created on the membrane and retained even when power was removed from the CRT. By using an array of dots, say 8 × 8, a larger pixel could be formed to represent 64 gray levels. One such device, the D36 Image Display, was made by DICOMED Corporation and a technical paper was presented at the 1972 Electro-Optical Conference in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\n\n"}

In a career that spanned five decades, her final appearances were in 1923. Vernon also toured internationally, appearing in New York, Johannesburg and Berlin.\n\nBorn in Lambeth in London in 1858 as Harriet Maria Whitehouse, the daughter of George Hickman Whitehouse (1837–1908), a printer, and Caroline (\"née\" Newport, 1840–1887), she was one of the leading music hall stars of the 1880s and 1890s, also performing regularly as the principal boy in pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.

The film, which was written by Peter Baynham and Robert Smigel from a story by Todd Durham, Daniel Hageman and Kevin Hageman, stars the voices of Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, Fran Drescher, Steve Buscemi, Molly Shannon, David Spade, and CeeLo Green. The film tells a story of Count Dracula, the owner of a hotel called Hotel Transylvania where the world's monsters can take a rest from human civilization. Dracula invites some of the most famous monsters to celebrate the 118th birthday of his daughter Mavis. When the \"human-free hotel\" is unexpectedly visited by an ordinary 21-year-old traveler named Jonathan, Dracula must protect Mavis from falling in love with him before the hotel's guests learn that there is a human in the castle, which may jeopardize the hotel's future and his career.\n\nThe film was released on September 28, 2012, and was met with mixed critical reception, while the general public received it favorably. It earned a total of $358 million worldwide against a budget of $85 million at the box office, and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. It launched a franchise with a sequel titled \"Hotel Transylvania 2\", which takes place seven years after the first film, released in 2015, and a third film titled \"\" released in 2018. A premiered on Disney Channel in June 2017, focusing on the teenage years of Mavis and her friends at the Hotel Transylvania.\n\nIn 1895, in the aftermath of the death of his wife Martha (Jackie Sandler) at the hands of an angry human mob, Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) commissions and builds a massive five-star, monsters-only hotel in Transylvania in which he raises his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) and to serve as a safe-place getaway for the world's monsters from fear of human persecution. Famous monsters such as Frank (Kevin James) and his wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), Wayne and Wanda Werewolf (Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon) and their massive immediate family, Griffin The Invisible Man (David Spade), and Murray the Mummy (CeeLo Green) often come to stay at the hotel.\n\nIn the present day, on Mavis's 118th birthday, Dracula allows his daughter to leave the castle in order to explore the human world, but he sets up an elaborate plan using his zombie bellhops disguised as humans to make them seem intimidating, and frighten her home. The plan works, but the zombies inadvertently lead a 21-year-old human Jonathan Loughran (Andy Samberg) back to the hotel. Dracula frantically disguises him as a Frankensteinesque Monster and passes him off as Frank's cousin \"Johnnystein\". Johnny soon encounters Mavis and the two \"Zing\", in a form of romantic attraction. Unable to get Johnny out of the hotel without notice, Dracula quickly improvises that Johnny is a party planner, brought in to bring a fresher approach to his own traditional and boring parties. Johnny quickly becomes a hit to the other monsters, but this disgusts and worries Dracula greatly. Dracula orders Johnny to leave, but Johnny is brought back by Mavis. After being shown the beauty of a sunrise by Johnny, Mavis is inspired to give humans another chance.\n\nMeanwhile, the hotel chef Quasimodo (Jon Lovitz) with the help of his pet rat Esmeralda learns that Johnny is a human and kidnaps him in order to cook him. Dracula intervenes and magically freezes Quasimodo to keep him from telling anyone that Johnny is human. Dracula leads Johnny to his quarters and shows him a painting of Martha, allowing Johnny to realize why Dracula built the hotel and became overprotective of Mavis. Johnny then agrees to leave for good, but Dracula convinces him to stay for the time-being to avoid ruining Mavis's birthday.\n\nThe party is a great success the next night, and Mavis looks forward to opening a gift from Martha. However, when Johnny and Mavis share their first kiss, Dracula overreacts, and, in his outburst, inadvertently confesses to deceiving Mavis with the town. A still-frozen Quasimodo bursts in and Mr. Fly (Chris Parnell) reveals from his frozen speech that Johnny is a human disguised by Dracula. The guests are outraged by the deceit at play, but Mavis is undeterred and wants to be with Johnny. Johnny feigns disinterest in Mavis and rejects her out of respect for her father and leaves the hotel.\n\nMavis flies onto the roof with her mother's present, and Dracula follows her in hopes of comforting her. He learns the present is a book about how Martha and Dracula \"Zinged\" and fell in love. Dracula realizes he no longer knows humankind's true tolerance of monsters, and manages to convince Frank, Wayne, Griffin, and Murray to head out into the human world to help him find Johnny, and with the scent-tracking ability of Wayne's daughter, Winnie, they learn that he is about to catch a flight to the United States. The four head to the airport, but are held up in a town celebrating a Monster Festival along the way. Admiring the group, the humans agree to help, and a team of men dressed as vampires provide Dracula shelter from the sunlight while he rushes to the airport. Dracula arrives to see Johnny's plane taking off, and he gives chase in bat form, burning in the sunlight. After getting Johnny's attention, Dracula makes his way to the front of the plane and uses his mind-controlling power on the pilot (Brian Stack) to help him apologize, stating that Mavis has grown up and can make her own decisions. Jonathan accepts his apology, and Dracula manipulates the pilot to return to the Transylvanian airport.\n\nDracula returns Jonathan to Mavis, announcing that he approves of Johnny. Johnny confesses to Mavis that their 'Zing' was mutual and the two kiss. The monsters finish celebrating Mavis's party, impressing the hotel guests.\n\n\n\"Hotel Transylvania\" was originally created and developed by comedy writer Todd Durham, which he based on his book of the same name; after creating the bible for a franchise of several films, television series, video games, books, merchandising, hotel chain, and theme park, he took the package unsolicited to Columbia Pictures and set it up at Sony Pictures Animation where he became the first of several screenwriters on the project.\n\nThe development process ultimately went through six directors: in 2006 Anthony Stacchi and David Feiss became the first directors set to helm the film. They were replaced by Jill Culton in 2008, who was followed by Chris Jenkins, with Todd Wilderman in 2010. In February 2011, Genndy Tartakovsky took over as the sixth scheduled director, and made his feature directorial debut with the film. He reimagined the film to follow the energy, organic nature, and exaggeration of 2D animation, particularly as seen in the work of director Tex Avery. \"I took all the aesthetics I like from 2-D and applied them here,\" Tartakovsky said. \"I don't want to do animation to mimic reality. I want to push reality.\" \"I wanted to have an imprint so you'd go, 'Well, only Genndy can make this.' It's hard, especially with CG, but I feel there's a lot of moments that feel that they're very me, so hopefully it'll feel different enough that it has a signature to it.\"\n\nIn November 2011, it was announced that Miley Cyrus would voice Mavis, Dracula's teenage daughter, but in February 2012, Cyrus left the film to coordinate a musical comeback. It was later announced that Selena Gomez would replace Cyrus.\n\n\n\"Hotel Transylvania\" premiered on September 8, 2012, at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film received a wide release on September 28, 2012. On October 26, 2012, Regal Entertainment Group Cinemas began exclusively playing the traditionally animated short film \"Goodnight Mr. Foot\" before the film. Based on \"Hotel Transylvania\", the short was directed and animated by Genndy Tartakovsky.\n\n\"Hotel Transylvania\" was released on Blu-ray (2D and 3D) and DVD on January 29, 2013. It was accompanied by the short animated film, \"Goodnight Mr. Foot\".\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 44% of critics gave the film positive reviews; the average rating is 5.3/10, based on 140 reviews.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave \"Hotel Transylvania\" an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nIGN editor Geoff Chapman rated the film 9 out of 10 and wrote \"This is a fun film, full of quirky gags and lovable characters. There are a few songs that smack a bit like soundtrack marketing for the kids, and the story is of course fairly predictable, but this movie is about enjoying a fun journey with great characters. It's a romp that kids and families will all enjoy. \"Hotel Transylvania\" is definitely somewhere you'll want to check in.\"\n\n\"Hotel Transylvania\" earned $148.3 million in North America, and $210.1 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $358.4 million. The officially reported budget for the film was $85 million, although \"Deadline Hollywood\" claimed that the film actually cost $104 million.

The film also earned the highest-grossing domestic debut for Sony Pictures Animation (also later overtaken by \"Hotel Transylvania 2\"). According to Sony's president of worldwide distribution, Rory Bruer, Sony was very satisfied with the film's performance, which was \"beyond anyone's imagination, and the holds are ridiculous. It exceeds expectations in every new market it opens in.\" \"Hotel Transylvania\" was theatrically released in China on October 28, 2013, more than a year after the worldwide premiere, and contributed $11,180,000 to the overall gross.\n\nA social game based on the film, titled \"Hotel Transylvania Social Game\" and made by Sony Pictures Interactive, was released on August 15, 2012.

As Sony Pictures Animation's first traditionally animated film, it was written and directed by Genndy Tartakovsky himself, who also animated the short with the help of Rough Draft Studios. Animated in the style of Bob Clampett, Tex Avery and Chuck Jones, Tartakovsky created the short in four weeks during the final production stages of the main film. Bigfoot (who has a non-speaking role in \"Hotel Transylvania\") was voiced by Corey Burton while the Witch Maid was voiced by Rose Abdoo. Both voice actors provided additional voices in \"Hotel Transylvania\".\n\nTaking place before the events of \"Hotel Transylvania\", the short stars Bigfoot, whose rest in Hotel Transylvania is being constantly disturbed by an overly enthusiastic witch maid.\n\nA sequel, titled \"Hotel Transylvania 2\", was released on September 25, 2015. Its story takes place seven years after the first film, with the hotel now open to human guests, and its owner, Count Dracula, being more preoccupied with the fact that his 5-year-old grandson is not a pure-blood vampire.

The car accident that puts the surgeon into a coma has many unexplained explosions. For reasons that are never explained the surgeon goes on a murdering spree and manages to survive numerous attacks that would horribly injure any normal person. To top it all off the actor who played him before the accident (George Kennedy) is now obviously replaced by a different actor, covered in bandages. In one of the most infamous scenes the girl's boyfriend lies on the floor, bleeding due to stab wounds, which causes her to remark: \"\"Moet ik een pleister voor je halen?

Although similar in many respects to adventure travel, jungle tourism pertains specifically to the context of region, culture and activity. According to the \"Glossary of Tourism Terms\", jungle tours have become a major component of green tourism in tropical destinations and are a relatively recent phenomenon of Western international tourism. \n\nOf the regions that take part in tourism-driven sustainable development practices and eco tourism, Mexican, Central and South American practices are the most pervasive in the industry; notably Mayan jungle excursions. Other regions include jungle territories in Africa, Australia, and the South Pacific.\n\nThe majority of jungle tour operators are concentrated in what is known as the Mayan World or \"Ruta Maya\". The Mayan World encompasses five different countries that hosted the entirety of the Mayan Civilization: Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras and El Salvador. Most tours consist of visits to popular Mayan archaeological sites such as Tikal, Guatemala, Chichen Itza, and Copan. These day visits will usually consist of a guided tour of a heavily tourist-concentrated Mayan and archaeological site. Tikal and Chichen Itza are prime examples of popular day-visit sites. Such sites involve a tour guide, designated either by the state government or by a private company, for the tourists. These tour guides are predominantly trained professionals, certified to take large parties of fifty through heavily populated archaeological sites. Nicaragua and Costa Rica are also popular destinations for this type of adventure travel. \n\nAlthough most of the visits to these more prominent sites involve day trips, there are also many jungle tour operators that showcase less-known, remote Mayan jungle ruins such as Nakum, Yaxha, and El Mirador. These tours involve much more preparation, time and funding to explore as they are usually in very remote and generally inaccessible regions of the Mayan jungles. These ruins and sites are reached by alternative and physically taxing means of travel such as bicycle, canoe, horseback or hiking. This is what essentially differentiates jungle tourism from any other sort of adventure travel tours. There are several tour operators that will employ the use of machetes during tours.\n\nAnother difference is that the majority of tour operators that travel deep into the Central and South American jungle will cap the number of persons traveling in the group at ten to fifteen. This is done to minimize the impact on the jungle flora and fauna. Federal laws in some countries prohibit any given group large than fifteen people traveling through the Mayan jungle, a generally protected region, but limited resources for enforcing such laws have allowed such practices to occur under the radar.\n\nIn Guatemala it has become very popular to hike through the jungle of the Mayan Biosphere due to the discovery of El Mirador, also known as the Lost City of Maya. There are no roads. Many take a quick flight from Flores while others hike through the jungles of the department of Petén. Groups should be smaller than 15 people in order not to reduce the impact on the environment.\n\n\n"}

On their TV show for the week of August 13–17, 1990, the late film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert praised the decision to apply the A rating since it was a concept they had often discussed on \"At the Movies\" in the context of harshly criticizing the MPAA's standards of forcing serious films aimed at adult audiences to either undergo damaging edits to receive R ratings or be locked out of most theatrical and advertising outlets. Both critics, however, also said the film itself was not very good. However, for anyone who lived in Hong Kong during the preceding five years, the movie was incredibly funny, a series of Hong Kong insider jokes, as well as moving, with a big storyline about what families went through to get precious Western passports.\n\nA man is hired, by people he believes to be gangsters, to deliver a briefcase from America to Hong Kong.\n\n"}

Brottman's writings on film and film culture have appeared in \"Film Quarterly\", \"Literature Film Quarterly\" and \"indieWire\", where she regularly covers international film festivals. \"Meat is Murder!\" is the eighth volume in Creation Books' series on extreme cinema. The book deals not only with film portrayals of cannibalism, but also with societal and historical aspects of the phenomenon. One of Brottman's points in the study is that recounting stories of the horror of the cannibalism taboo—whether through myth, fairy tale, true crime or film—actually strengthens our communal ties.\n\"Meat is Murder!\" is broken into three sections dealing with different aspects of cannibalism. The first part deals with cultural cannibalism. This aspect of the subject is further broken down into sections dealing with dietary, symbolic, and hunger. Criminal and psychotic cannibalism make up the second part of the book, featuring descriptions of notorious real-life cannibals. Cannibalism as it is portrayed in popular culture finishes this section of the book. The last third of the book discusses the portrayal of cannibalism in film. The first part of this section covers documentaries and art-house films such as Paul Bartel's \"Eating Raoul\" (1982) and Peter Greenaway's \"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover\" (1989). The second chapter of this section of the book covers films on individuals who cannibalize, and the third chapter is on cannibal families or societies.\nTobe Hooper's \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" (1974) and Ruggero Deodato's \"Cannibal Holocaust\" (1980) are among the films given coverage in this chapter.\n\nIn the section on cannibal cinema, Mikita Brottman asserts that the subject is more widespread than is commonly assumed. She shows that cannibalism is a subject which has been portrayed in all time periods through film history, in films such as the 1908 silent comedy \"King of the Cannibal Islands\", through David F. Friedman's exploitation \"documentary\" \"Cannibal Island\" (1956), through \"Soylent Green\" (1973), \"Alive\" (1993), and Ridley Scott's \"Hannibal\" (2001).\n\n\"Humanities and Social Sciences Online\" calls the \"Meat is Murder!\" a \"gruesome but fascinating tour through the anthropological, criminological, literary, and cinematic history of cannibalism\".\nReviewer Philip Simpson judges that the book is \"compelling\" and takes a scholarly approach to its subject matter. \nThe \"Headpress Guide to the Counter Culture\" (2004) points out that Brottman is not condescending to her subject matter, but criticizes the book for its lengthy film synopses. The review also deems the illustrations in the book to be of a poor quality.\n\"The Journal of Popular Culture\" writes that Brottman's theories as to the communal ties created through the horror of the subject of cannibalism are \"argued persuasively\".\nReviews reprinted at the book's publisher's site include \"Total Film\", which calls Brottman's work, \"worryingly exhaustive, [and] hungrily informed,\" and \"Terrorizer\" which writes that the book is \"an informed study of both cultural and cinematic cannibalism... [which] combines meticulous research with a fascinating insight into the origins of cannibalism, infamous real-life perpetrators and the celluloid treatment of the subject.\" \"Film Review\" labeled the book, \"An excellent study of cannibal culture.\"\n\n\n"}

Founded in January 2001 by promoters Dan Mirade & Neil Manolian, the MWF is one of the top promotions in the Northeastern United States along with Chaotic Wrestling, New England Championship Wrestling and Yankee Pro Wrestling.\n\nAmong the wrestlers who have appeared in the promotion include independent wrestlers Abyss, A.J. Styles, Kofi Kingston, Joey Mercury, Antonio Thomas, Chris Sabin, Alex Shelley, Rick Fuller, Homicide, and \"Hurricane\" John Walters.\n\nDue to its close working relationship with World Wrestling Entertainment, the promotion is one of several on the independent circuit to regularly feature a large number of former World Wrestling Federation veterans including \"Road Dog\" Jesse James Armstrong, Scotty 2 Hotty, Al Snow, Kamala, Demolition (Ax and Smash) and MWF President Paul Bearer. Former WWF World Heavyweight Champion The Iron Sheik served as MWF Lt. Commissioner. Others who have also made appearances include The Missing Link, Bob Orton, Jr. and Ox Baker.\n\nJohn Cena, Sr., the father of multi-time World Heavyweight Champion John Cena, took control of the promotion in September 2007 after buying out Chairman Neil Manolian's partial stock in the company. Cena became MWF South President after a confrontation with Paul Bearer at Soul Survivor VIII.\n\nThe Millennium Wrestling Federation was founded by Dan Mirade & Neil Manolian in January 2001, partly founded in memory of longtime Boston promoter Tony Rumble, and held their first show on September 28 of that year. Based in Melrose, Massachusetts, the promotion regularly began running shows in the greater Boston area for over a year before the debut of its weekly half-hour television program \"MWF Xtra\" on Labor Day weekend. The show was hosted by Dan Mirade and MWF on-air personalities The Jackal & Dr. Brad Von Johnson as well as special guest Tiger Mulligan, who would later win the promotion's Heavyweight Championship defeating \"2Xtreme\" John Brooks in the tournament finals of the \"Soul Survivor\" competition at the \"Soul Survivor I\" supercard to crown the first MWF Heavyweight Champion and was presented the championship belt by Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan.\n\nOn October 5, 2002, Gary Michael Cappetta & Superstar Billy Graham appeared at a MWF benefit show at the America Civic Center in Wakefield, Massachusetts. The card also featured Road Dogg and the MWF debuts of \"Die Hard\" Eddie Edwards & Todd Hanson.\n\nA second show, \"MWF ULTRA\", was also introduced with its first episode on October 12, 2003 but eventually became a monthly, one-hour special in October 2004. Its guests have included Johnny Fabulous, Karl Lauer, Scotty 2 Hotty, Demolition Smash, The Iron Sheik, Percy Pringle and actress Brigitte Nielsen. In addition to its wide use of regional cable TV throughout the New England area, the promotion also began broadcasting its shows via internet broadcast and in-demand in May 2005 and became available in over 60 countries. That same year, the two more championships were created with \"Die Hard\" Eddie Edwards winning a tournament for the MWF Television Championship and, at \"MWF Iron Sheik Appreciation Night\", Todd Hanson and Beau Douglas won a Tag Team Royal Rumble eliminating The Islanders for the titles. The MWF Heavyweight Championship, which had since become vacant, was won by Dylan Kage when he defeated Slyck Wagner Brown on the first episode of \"MWF ULTRA\".\n\nOn November 11, 2005, the \"Soul Survivor III\" supercard featured MWF Heavyweight Champion Dylan Kage joining forces with Paul Bearer defeating Luis Ortiz, and MWF Television Champion Eddie Edwards defending his title against Fergal Devitt & John Walters in the main event in Lynn, Massachusetts. The show also featured Test, The Sandman, The Missing Link and Ox Baker . NWA Ireland wrestler Fergal Devitt appeared at several MWF events while in New England during his 2005-2006 US tour. Facing Eddie Edwards and John Walters in a triple treat for the MWF TV Title, the match ended after 15 minutes when Edwards pinned Walters for the title. This match, gained considerable attention on the US independent scene.\n\nInvolved in fundraising and other community projects, the Millennium Wrestling Federation's on-going \"Keep The Kids Off The Streets\" Campaign presents live wrestling events in inner city neighborhoods. Its efforts in fundraising activities has raised tens of thousands of dollars for a number of charities and non-profit organizations including the American Red Cross, the Special Olympics and has received extensive press coverage from The Boston Globe, The Howard Stern Show, KISS 108 FM, the Eddie Andelman Show, CN8 Sports Pulse and ESPN Radio. The promotion has also been involved in promoting other non-wrestling events in Boston such as hosting the Boston premiere of \"The Condemned\" (including a Q&A with \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin) and The Iron Sheik's appearance on Toronto's Hi-Fi Network and promoting the Wrestling's Living Legends reunion on the morning of WrestleMania 23 in Windsor, Ontario. The event also featured Demolition (Ax and Smash) in their first appearance in sixteen years.\n\nIn September 2007, MWF Chairman Neil Manolian sold his share of the promotion to John Cena, Sr., giving him majority control of the company, and as a result, was named MWF President three months later, replacing on-air personality The Jackal who had been appointed to the position at the beginning of the year. During the first half of 2008, a number of wrestlers from Total Nonstop Action Wrestling appeared for the promotion. On March 29, the promotion held its first show in Nashua, New Hampshire at \"Live Free or Die\".\n\nOn June 21, the MWF held the final professional wrestling event at the Good Time Emporium in Somerville, Massachusetts prior to its close at the end of the month. The \"Night of Champions\" supercard included MWF Heavyweight Champion Todd Hanson successfully defending his title against Abyss, Rick Fuller and Executioner Milonas in a Monster's Ball match. in the main event. The undercard featured a lumberjack match between MWF Television Champion Tommaso Ciampa and Jay Lethal, MWF Tag Team Champions The Canadian Superstars against Beau Douglas and a mystery partner. The event also had the debut of Homicide and the return of Chris Sabin. This was followed by a VIP Q&A session and an autograph/photo fanfest with Abyss, Jay Lethal, Homicide, Chris Sabin and Leticia Cline as well as a special appearance by MWF President John Cena, Sr. and the Iron Sheik. The promotion also held a raffle in which the winner would receive a free lunch with the Iron Sheik. The event was originally scheduled to be held on March 29, however the promotion was forced to reschedule the event when Total Nonstop Action Wrestling needed Jay Lethal, Chris Sabin and Homicide for an additional television taping of \"TNA Impact!\" during WrestleMania weekend in Orlando, Florida.\n\nA regular on the independent circuit since the early 1990s, the Iron Sheik became associated with the MWF soon after its establishment and was later named the MWF Lt. Commissioner. On August 5, 2005, the Iron Sheik, Dan Mirade and MWF Commissioner Dr. Brad Von Johnson were involved in a serious car accident when they were hit head on by a drunk driver following an event, \"Iron Sheik Appreciation Night\", in Blackstone, Massachusetts. The Iron Sheik caused a disturbance at the event earlier refusing to sign autographs or to actively participate in the show going on a drug induced episode in the parking lot locking himself in a wrestlers car. The three were later treated at a local hospital and the Iron Sheik later claimed he might never wrestle again.\n\nIn November 2004, during an MWF Studio Shoot Interview shoot interview with Dan Mirade, the Iron Sheik went on a tirade when asked about his appearance at WrestleMania III with Nikolai Volkoff and their match against The Killer Bees (B. Brian Blair and Jim Brunzell) making several controversial and derogatory statements in reference to Brian Blair. This interview was later released on a three-hour DVD and has since become popular on websites such as YouTube and led to his appearances on Howard Stern. The video has been seen by over one and a half million fans. In 2005, the Iron Sheik was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2008, the MWF conducted another shoot interview with the Iron Sheik. Similarly released on DVD, the Sheik verbally attacked Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior, making remarks about what he'd do to the Warrior's daughter if she was 18. He later made a Christmas challenge to Kramer, footage from the infamous \"Iron Sheik Appreciation Night\" and a \"drug induced\" telephone interview. The Sheik was attacked by the MWF Stalker, claiming he had gotten alcohol poisoning when an MWF cameraman had given him beer in his hotel room.\n\nOn December 28, 2001, the promotion held its second live event in Revere, Massachusetts which was to raise money for Butch Miller, better known as Bushwhacker Butch of The Bushwhackers, who was hospitalized from an untreated staph infection. Among those who headlined the show included Road Dogg and ECW wrestlers Little Guido, Super Nova and Chris Chetti. \"Tough Enough\" finalist Christopher Nowinski also made a surprise appearance.\n\nA few weeks prior to the event, Jim \"The Anvil\" Neidhart contacted the promotion via e-mail offering to appear at the show. Neidhart also said he would donate an official Hart Foundation leather jacket for the raffle being held. In exchange, the promotion agreed to provide transportation. When the company was unable to afford to fly him in from Calgary, which would cost at least $1,200 (more than the cost of the actual fundraiser), Neidhart offered to sell his frequent flyer miles for $500 which the promotion accepted.\n\nThe promotion received no contact from Neidhart after that point and, on the day of the fundraiser, Neidhart did not arrive. According to owner Dan Mirade, he was later told that Neidhart had been planning on coming to Boston to spend Christmas week with a \"ring rat\". When she decided to spend Christmas with her family down south, Neidhart stayed in Calgary and did not return the money he received from the promotion.\n\nReceiving no response to their e-mail and telephone messages, the promotion posted Neidhart's home phone number on the front page of the MWF website. The promotion, which had gotten a number of replies from fans asking for an explanation for Neidhart's absence, explained that they had not received word from Neidhart and suggested fans to confront Neidhart themselves.\n\nNeidhart got in contact with the promotion soon after this and claimed that he had intended to send the money back, but now refused because they had \"upset him\". Neidhart eventually claimed in a later e-mail that he had sent the $500 to Butch Miller, however this was denied by both Butch Miller and longtime tag team partner Luke Williams. Soon after seeing him on the Raw 15th anniversary show, Dan Mirade wrote about the incident on his website and challenged Neidhart for an explanation however Neidhart has not responded.\n\nMirade has been increasingly outspoken against both the increasing violence of \"hardcore wrestling\" as well as steroid and drug abuse which has resulted in the deaths of a high number of professional wrestlers.

It represents New Zealand amateur radio operators nationally and internationally. NZART is a founding member of the International Amateur Radio Union. It is an association of individual members, however those members are encouraged to form local branches.\n\nMembership of NZART is voluntary; it is estimated that approximately 35% of New Zealand's licensed amateur radio operators belong. Members are represented by Councillors to the NZART Council, the executive body tasked with the business management of the association.\n\nThe New Zealand Association of Radio Transmitters formed on 16 August 1926. In the same year, Gordon Smithson (Z1AF) made the first NZART broadcast. The first publication of \"Break-in\", the NZART journal, was in 1928. In 1929 NZART became a more powerful organisation, joining the International Amateur Radio Union and successfully lobbying the New Zealand Government for a reduction in the compulsory licensing fees.\n\nIn 1934 the Association became an incorporated society and in 1982 their membership numbers reached a high of 4,397. The first NZART written submission to the New Zealand government was in 1989 and related to the proposed \"Radicommunications Bill\". In 1998 the Association established the Radioscience Education Trust.\n\nThe NZART Council includes 12 executives. Three of these are the NZART President, Vice-President, and Immediate Past President. Regional councillors are elected to represent different geographic regions of New Zealand: three from the Northern District, three from the Central District, two from the Midland District, and one from the Southern District. The number of Councillors in each district is roughly representative of the number of licensed amateurs that they are directly accountable to in their respective geographic areas.\n\nThe NZART Council works with an appointed NZART Business Manager. The Business Manager is the only person employed by NZART (20 hrs per week) and is tasked with the day-to-day business operations of the association, including manning their office, located in Upper Hutt, near Wellington.\n\nAdditional officers reporting directly to NZART Council include the National Director Amateur Radio Emergency Communications, The Engineering Licensing Group (ELG) and the Administration Liaison Officer (ALO), who is charged with liaison with the Radio Spectrum Management Group of the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE).\n\nThe NZART has performed an advocacy function, commenting on policy and planning initiatives proposed by the New Zealand government in the areas of radio licences, spectrum allocations for broadband wireless, and the future of digital communication. The Association also contributed to the creation of EMF exposure standards in their role as member of the NZ RF Standard Committee.\n\nIn 2006, the Ministry of Economic Development's Radio Spectrum Management division was assisted by NZART and the local Coastguard Boating Education Service in the creation of an update to the Spectrum Management and Registration Technology (SMART) which allowed people to search online for radio operator information including callsigns. In 2008, it was noted that there were some discrepancies between the SMART system and the callsign book produced by NZART.\n\nThe official journal of the NZART is \"Break-In\", a bi-monthly publication containing articles of interest to the amateur radio community. Also, an annual publication known as the \"Call Book\" provides an index of licensed amateurs in New Zealand by call sign, providing addresses for the purpose of contact acknowledgement (QSL), as well as much other information useful to the New Zealand radio enthusiast. Other publications include \"Ham Shacks, Brass Pounders and Rag Chewers\", a history of amateur radio in New Zealand, published in 1997 with assistance from the New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs Historical Branch.\n\nIn 1980, NZART collaborated with author Jumbo Godfrey to produce a \"Basic radio training manual: a study course for the amateur radio operators\".\n\nThe Association provides some educational services, such as providing demonstrative lectures on electromagnetic wave theory. Another service offered by the Association is to provide trained personnel and radio communications systems to Amateur Radio Emergency Communications, a group which liaises with the New Zealand Police and Civil Defense services in emergency situations.\n\nBranches of NZART are generally radio clubs and related organisations, and are found across the country. The Branches facilitate the representation of individual members at a national level through the NZART National Conference. Most radio clubs are individually incorporated and operate on a day-to-day basis independently of the NZART.The number following the branch name is their NZART branch number.\n\nNumerous branches experienced membership decline (possibly proportionate to a national decline), and have been reduced to a status of \"recess\" for several years.\n\n\n"}

It is about a railroad worker who leads a team of freedom fighters to oppose the Japanese during the occupation in World War II\n\nIn December 1941, Japan expands the occupation of its neighbouring countries to Southeast Asia. The railway from Tianjin to Nanjing in East China became a key military transportation route, heavily guarded by Japanese soldiers. Railroad worker Ma Yuan (Jackie Chan) leads a team of freedom fighters. Using his deep knowledge of the train network, he and his men sabotage it, ambushing Japanese soldiers and stealing supplies to feed the starving Chinese. Although the freedom fighters have no weapons of their own, they employ whatever tools are at hand, including a hammer and shovels, loose railway track planks and diverted trains. The local Chinese call the unlikely heroes the “Railroad Tigers”. The freedom fighters find themselves on the wrong side of the tracks when the Japanese send reinforcements to Shandong. In an act of defiance, Ma Yuan launches his most dangerous mission yet, blowing up a heavily guarded railroad bridge.

{"id": "3829597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3829597", "title": "Real time (media)", "text": "Real time (media)\n\nReal time within the media is a method where events are portrayed at the same rate at which the characters experience them. For example, if a movie told in real time is two hours long, then the plot of that movie covers two hours of fictional time. If a daily real-time comic strip runs for six years, then the characters will be six years older at the end of the strip than they were at the beginning. This technique can be enforced with varying levels of precision. In some stories, every minute of screen time is a minute of fictional time. In other stories, such as the daily comic strip \"For Better or For Worse\", each day's strip does not necessarily correspond to a new day of fictional time, but each year of the strip does correspond to one year of fictional time.\n\nReal time fiction dates back to the climactic structure of classical Greek drama.\n\nOften, use of split screens or picture-in-pictures are used to show events occurring at the same time, or the context in which various subplots are affecting each other. Examples include the television series \"24\" and films \"Timecode\" and \"Phone Booth\". On-screen clocks are often used to remind the audience of the real-time presentation.\n\n\nIn a real-time computer game or simulation, events in the game occur at the same rate as the events which are being depicted. For instance, in a real-time combat game, in one hour of play the game depicts one hour of combat.\n\nIn comic books, the use of real time is made more complicated by the fact that most serial comics are released on a monthly basis and are traditionally 20 to 30 pages long, making it difficult to tell a story set in real time without overlooking important events from one month to the next. Another explanation is the prevalence of the super-hero genre in American comics, and the iconic status attached to such characters : it is often considered that such mythological, sometimes godlike heroes cannot age in real time without losing the characteristics that make them special. Hence the more common use of floating timelines in Marvel Comics or DC Comics. Exceptions include Marvel Comics' New Universe line of books, Erik Larsen's long-running \"Savage Dragon\" ongoing series, John Byrne's \"\" (three non-canon miniseries exploring the notion of \"what if Superman and Batman could age?\"), and Ben Dunn's \"Ninja High School\".\n\nComic strips which feature characters aging in real-time include:\n\n\nIn the Inspector Rebus series of detective novels (17 as of 2010) by the Scottish writer Ian Rankin, characters age in step with the publication date. Rebus is stated to have been born in 1947; in the 2007 novel \"Exit Music\" he reached 60, and retired.\n\nThe Mandie series of children's mystery novels by Lois Gladys Leppard are exactly one hundred years from the present real time and ended by the eighteenth year (or one hundred and eighteenth year) of the main protagonist in 2006 at the reader's end of childhood and adolescence.\n\nIn \"A Christmas Carol\" the entire story takes place in real time.\n"}
{"id": "25664778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25664778", "title": "Red Cotton Night-Cap Country", "text": "Red Cotton Night-Cap Country\n\nRed Cotton Night-Cap Country, or Turf and Towers (1873) is a poem in blank verse by Robert Browning. It tells a story of sexual intrigue, religious obsession and violent death in contemporary Paris and Normandy, closely based on the true story of the death, supposedly by suicide, of the jewellery heir Antoine Mellerio. \"Red Cotton Night-Cap Country\" has never been one of Browning's more popular poems, originally because of the perceived sordidness of the story, and later on grounds thus summarised by the critic C. H. Herford:\nThe poet followed on the heels of the journalist, and borrowed, it must be owned, not a little of his methods. If any poem of Browning's may be compared to versified special correspondence, it is this. He tells the story, in his own person, in blank verse of admirable ease and fluency, from which every pretence of poetry is usually remote.\n\nIt opens by setting the scene in the Norman village of Saint-Rambert amid countryside which the poet discusses with his friend Anne Thackeray, the dedicatee of the poem. Since she has jokingly named the locale \"White Cotton Night-Cap Country\", from the somnolence of the Calvados district and the white caps worn by the inhabitants, Browning changes the colour to red by way of pointing up the passion of the story he is about to tell, and alluding to the \"bonnet rouge\" worn by the revolutionaries of 1789 and again during the Paris Commune. The poem now turns to the story of Léonce Miranda, the heir to a jewellery business, who is raised on a luxurious estate in Saint-Rambert in the shadow of the church towers mentioned in the poem's subtitle, and who is torn between the opposing demands of religious devotion and the sensual, materialist side of his nature – \"turf\", as Browning calls it. Miranda takes a mistress called Clara de Millefleurs, and houses her in a luxuriously renovated priory. Miranda's scandalised mother exacerbates his sense of guilt over this affair to such good effect that he tries to commit suicide by drowning himself in the Seine. He fails in this attempt, but on the death of his mother Miranda is more riddled with guilt than ever, and so breaks off his relationship with Clara and, while trying to burn her letters, mutilates himself by burning off both his hands. However, he resumes the affair and tries to work off his guilt by making donations to the church of La Ravissante near his home. He dies by throwing himself from the belvedere of the priory as an act of faith, believing that he will be miraculously borne by the angels of the Virgin Mary to La Ravissante. His will, which divides his estate between the Church and Clara, is contested by his \"cousinry\", who believe Miranda to have been insane when he made it, but the courts uphold the will, declaring Miranda's death to have been an accident.\n\nHaving been originally told about the case of Antoine Mellerio in 1870 by his friend Joseph Milsand, Browning went on to research the facts with great thoroughness, reading newspaper reports and transcripts of the legal documents and interviewing residents of the district. Browning wrote \"Red Cotton Night-Cap Country\" during December 1872 and January 1873, while the lawsuit over Mellerio's will was still under appeal. He originally used the real names of the characters and places in the \"affaire Mellerio\", but on submitting the manuscript to his friend Lord Coleridge, then Attorney-General, he was advised that he might be sued for libel. All the names were accordingly changed: Antoine Mellerio to Léonce Miranda, Anna de Beaupré to Clara de Millefleurs, Saint-Aubin to Saint-Rambert, and so on. The poem was published during the first week of May 1873 by Smith, Elder & Co., but they did not need to reprint it until, in 1889, along with \"The Inn Album\", it formed volume 12 of his \"Poetical Works\".\n\nReviews were mixed. \"The Spectator\" spoke for many when it said that \"Mr. Browning has not succeeded in giving any true poetic excuse for telling a story so full of disagreeable elements.\" The anonymous reviewer in \"Harper's Magazine\" was undeterred by the fact that he had not read the poem through:\nIt is not necessary to traverse every square mile of the Great Desert to know that its scenery is tame. We have read enough to know both the story and the manner in which it is told, and to enter our strong protest against the endeavour to glorify an illicit love with one who had been in succession a profligate woman and an unfaithful wife…It can only be characterized as harmless because the class of people who would be liable to be harmed by it will not understand nor even read it.\nThomas Carlyle remarked in conversation that there were \"ingenious remarks here and there; but nobody out of bedlam ever before thought of choosing such a theme\". On the other hand, \"The Examiner\" thanked Browning for \"his brave and eloquent unfolding of some of the chief social abuses of the present day\". A few years later the poet Arthur Symons praised it for virtues not normally associated with Browning: \"No tale could be more straightforward, no language more lucid, no verse more free from harshness or irregularity\", while G. K. Chesterton wrote that \"Browning was one of those wise men who can perceive the terrible and impressive poetry of the police-news which is commonly treated as vulgarity\".\n\n"}

Rodolfo was interviewed as the inventor of the vibrator-guitar. The character rose to fame after he was later presented by the show's host, Andreu Buenafuente, with a song called \"Baila el Chiki-chiki\" (Dance the Chiki-chiki), a parody of reggaeton music filled with jokes and political references, and the show's host decided to enter the song into the Spanish selection process for the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. Rodolfo landed Spain's best placement since Eurovision Song Contest 2004.\n\nFor the Eurovision Song Contest 2008, the Spanish broadcaster RTVE decided to make the song selection process more democratic, so, in an agreement with MySpace, a webpage was created where the general public could vote for any of the artists who were interested in participating, possibly discovering new talents. Any aspiring singer could upload a video to enter the contest. The top 5 voted videos, along with 5 more entries selected by a jury, went to a televised final where the Spanish Eurovision Song Contest 2008 entry would be chosen.\n\nMore than 530 songs were submitted, the comedic act of Rodolfo Chikilicuatre and his \"Baila el Chiki-chiki\" song among them. The song was heavily promoted by late night show \"Buenafuente\" and television channel La Sexta that aired the show, and ended up being selected by a landslide, earning 56.28% of the votes, well ahead of the runner-up, which earned only 14.6%. The winner was chosen through text messaging.\n\nThis selection was met with a certain degree of controversy, as many considered it a gimmick song, and not worthy of representing Spain. It also met controversy because Rodolfo Chikilicuatre was a comedic act, with no prior songs, and was backed by a particular show (\"Buenafuente\") and a private broadcaster (LaSexta). RTVE stood by their choice of voting system.\n\nOn March 11, 2008, Rodolfo announced some changes to the lyrics of his song to comply with the rules of the Eurovision Song Contest, thus removing partially the names of the politicians included in the song (José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Hugo Chávez and Mariano Rajoy). Even if Chávez's name was completely removed, a reference to a previous incident with King Juan Carlos I of Spain was kept. A non-political reference to Serbia was added. The song was also made longer, as the original was considered too short, going from 1:20 to 2:56 minutes, and several verses in English were added. The new version was presented on March 14, 2008.\n\nRodolfo performed the \"Chiki-chiki\" theme with other singers: King Africa, Tata Golosa, Mojinos Escozios and Dustin the Turkey.\n\nDuring the final contest of the Eurovision 2008 on May 24, 2008, the song \"Baila el Chiki-chiki\" reached sixteenth place with 55 points, tied with Albania.\n\n\n"}

Snow forts are generally built by children as a playground game or winter pastime and are used as defensive structures in snowball fights. They are also built and used for make-believe games such as \"house\", \"store\", or \"community\", a game where multiple forts are built in a group. Along with the snowman, it is one of the two structures commonly built by children out of snow.\n\nSnow structures made for sleeping are called igloos when made from snow blocks and quinzhees when made by hollowing out a pile of snow.\n\nA snow fort consists of walls of piled and compacted snow. They may be \"open\" or \"closed\", that is, a person in the snow fort may be completely surrounded by the walls on all sides, there may be a \"door\", or the person may be completely exposed on one side. The latter variation is used for snowball fights where opponents have forts facing each other and attack exclusively from their own fort. Existing structures such as the walls or concave corners of a building can be used as part of the snow fort, allowing for faster and easier construction. A snow fort can also be a tunneled-out burrow built in a large snow drift.\n\nAlthough the most common way to pack snow for a fort is by piling, pressing, and/or carving out snow by hand, possibly with the aid of a snow shovel, other ways exist. One way is to roll out several large balls of snow - possibly weighing over 200 lbs. each - as if making a snowman, lining them up in a protective barrier, and using loose snow as mortar to hold them together. Another way is to create cylindrical snow blocks by shovelling snow into a five gallon bucket and then compacting it. If made out of wet snow and left to freeze overnight, these blocks become almost indestructible. They can be difficult to stack into a stable defensive structure, but they can double as unwieldy yet powerful missiles capable of punching holes in enemy snow forts, knocking over a grown man, etc.\n\nSnow forts are usually at least knee-height and one-roomed. Forts built for snowball fights may be higher, and ones built for \"house\" may have lower walls and multiple rooms. When used for snowball fights, snow forts often have sections where the wall is lower, through which the occupants throw snowballs.\n\nThe SnowCastle of Kemi is claimed to be the biggest snow castle in the world, first built in Kemi in 1996. Since then the world's largest snow castle has been rebuilt annually. The area has varied from 13,000 to over 20,000 square meters. Highest towers have been over 20 meters high and longest walls over 1,000 meters long. Sometimes there have been three-story buildings there. The SnowRestaurant has ice tables and seats covered with reindeer fur. The ecumenical SnowChapel decorated with ice sculptures has seen numerous weddings with some couples coming from Japan and Hong Kong. There is also a SnowHotel in the snow castle. The hotel has double rooms and a honeymoon suite with ice decorations.\n\nThere are also ice decorations in Lainio Snow Hotel (near Ylläs and Levi, Finland).\n\nIn Kingston, Ontario, the annual FebFest snow sculpture competition in Confederation Park features snow forts by the Royal Military College of Canada and Queen's University. The snow forts must not only be pleasing to look at but also safe for children to play on. In 2008, Royal Military College's snow fort was modelled after the MacKenzie Building in the Second Empire style with a Mansard roof, and a central tower incorporating a working clock, flanked by projecting end towers and a slide. Both teams worked through the night, filling rectangular recycling bins with snow.\n\nThe Snowking Winter Festival is an annual festival held each March in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. The festival is a major winter tourist draw to Yellowknife. It features a huge snow castle with window panes of ice built on Yellowknife Bay, on Great Slave Lake.

Quick pencil drawings and marker renderings are two of the most common traditional techniques, although nowadays Adobe Flash, Adobe Photoshop, Storyboard Pro, and other storyboard applications are often used. The digital camera is one of the latest techniques in creating storyboards. \n\nMost storyboard artists nowadays begin and finish their work on computers using software and digital pencils or a graphics tablet. Storyboard artists may use photos to create visuals where stock photos or photos taken specifically for the project are put together digitally to produce a photographic representation called a photovisual. \n\nFor motion pictures, some filmmakers, directors, and producers choose to use clip-art computer programs designed to create storyboards, or use a dedicated 3D storyboarding software, or a more multi-purpose 3D program which can also be used to create elements of the storyboards.\n\nStoryboard artists have different goals in different industries.\n\nIn advertising, the storyboard artist can be called upon to create a representation of what the finished TV commercial, or spot, will look like in order to persuade and engage the client to buy the concept being pitched. This can either be at the time the agency is trying to win the client's business or once the client has signed on with the agency. In either case, the important element is for the storyboards to visualize for the client what the agency's creative director or \"creatives\" are thinking will sell the client's product. A storyboard artist may also be asked to visually represent several versions of a campaign for print ads.\n\nIn live-action film, a storyboard artist is hired at the beginning of a project. When a storyboard artist is hired by a motion picture company, the artist must break down the scenes of the script into shots which can be filmed. This is done under the supervision of the film's director in order to ensure the director's vision from the start of the project. As the production proceeds, the storyboards are presented to the cinematographer who is then responsible for bringing that vision to the screen. \n\nFilm production companies may also hire a storyboard artist to create polished presentation-style storyboards (which might also include sound) which can be used by an executive producer to raise the money to create the film.\n\nIn animation, projects are often pitched on the basis of storyboards alone (that is, a screenplay may not be written until later), and storyboard artists continue to work throughout the production to develop particular sequences. After a sequence is edited the director and/or storyboard artist and team may need to rework the sequence as it becomes evident that changes need to be made for timing and story.\n"}

The application process required a web video to be submitted, available publicly for consideration for the position. The job duties listed were primarily publicity-related with web videos, blogging, and photo diaries. The submission web site crashed two days following the launch of the campaign, from excessive visits and application video uploading.\n\nInterest continued for months. On 11 February 2009, Christopher Grima jumped off the South Causeway Bridge in Fort Pierce in Florida. The police report said that he \"wanted to capture a video of himself jumping off the bridge, to gain attention of the recruiters\" for this job. He quickly received a summons for breach of the peace / disorderly conduct. More marketing-savvy applicants created blogs and established Facebook groups to create buzz about themselves. Two hoaxes also fueled interest. Tourism Queensland invested US$1m in the campaign and generated US$70m of global publicity just one month after the campaign's launch.\n\nOver 35,000 applications were received from over 200 countries, and whittled down to 16 finalists (including one chosen by an on-line vote). Finalists came from Australia (two), United States (two), United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Taiwan, India, China, Japan, France and South Korea. Ten were male and their ages ranged from 20 to 39. The candidates were interviewed on the island starting 3 May 2009. The United Kingdom finalist Ben Southall, 34, a charity fundraiser and ostrich-rider from Petersfield, Hampshire, UK, was appointed as the new caretaker of the island on 6 May 2009.\n\nBy the campaign's end, it has generated more than $200 million in global publicity value for Tourism Queensland. Brisbane advertising agency CumminsNitro was awarded three top awards at the Cannes International Advertising Festival. The campaign was acknowledged as very successful. BBC Television made a one-hour documentary about the final stages of the campaign which was directed by Agnieszka Piotrowska. Narrated by Toby Stephens, the film was broadcast on 2 July 2009 on BBC1 at 9pm, achieving the highest viewing figures for the whole week.\n\nThe winner was Ben Southall, from the United Kingdom. In the last week of his paradise job, he was stung by an Irukandji jellyfish. Although lethal cases are known, he made a full recovery.\n\nSouthall is now an Ambassador of Queensland Tourism and took residency in Queensland after the six-month period on the island had ended. Since then Ben has established himself as an adventure advocate in Australia taking on extreme adventures around the world including a 1600 km kayak along the Great Barrier Reef in 2011, running a number of marathons around the country. He set a world record to climb the tallest mountain in each Australian state (8) in the shortest ever time in April 2013 - the Aussie 8 expedition took 8 days. His website follows his adventures around the planet.\n\nIn 2008 Southall circumnavigated Africa in a Land Rover, known as Colonel Mustard, covering 65,000 km. He climbed the five highest mountains on the continent and ran five marathons in the year raising $50,000 (AUS) for charity.\n\nHe married Sophee McPhee in November 2012 back on Hamilton Island where he lived as the Caretaker of the Islands of the Great Barrier Reef\n\nIn 2010 the advertising campaign was awarded two prestigious D&AD Black Pencil Awards.\n\n"}
{"id": "857279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=857279", "title": "The Queers", "text": "The Queers\n\nThe Queers are an American punk rock band, formed in 1981 by the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, native Joe Queer, along with Scott Gildersleeve (a.k.a. Tulu), and Jack Hayes (a.k.a. Wimpy Rutherford). With the addition of Keith Hages in 1982 the band started playing their first live shows. The band originally broke up in late 1984, but reformed with Joe Queer and a new line-up in 1986. In 1990, the band signed with Shakin' Street Records and released their first album \"Grow Up\". The album earned the band notability within New England, but with the release of their next album 1993's \"Love Songs for the Retarded\", on Lookout! Records, their following grew larger.\n\nIn 2006, after releasing six albums on Lookout! Records, the band rescinded their master rights from the label, citing breach of contract over unpaid royalties. Later that year they signed with Asian Man Records.\n\nThe Queers' cover of \"Wipe Out\" was featured in the 2007 Columbia Pictures and ImageWorks Studios mockumentary film \"Surf's Up,\" produced by Sony Pictures Animation and National Geographic Films.\n\nThe Queers play a Ramones-derived style of pop punk. Much like The Ramones, common lyrical themes are of girls, love, drugs, alcohol and having fun. Musically the band deviates slightly from the driving rhythm guitar sound of the Ramones and augments their songs with harmony vocals and guitar solos. They have been described as \"The Ramones meets The Beach Boys\". Ben Weasel of Screeching Weasel infrequently collaborates on songwriting with Joe Queer. The band is well known for the variety of cover versions they include on their records and during live performances. Bands/artists covered by The Queers include The Beach Boys, Ramones (including a complete re-recording of the \"Rocket to Russia\" album), Unnatural Axe, The Nobodys, Angry Samoans, The Mr. T Experience, Skeeter Davis, The Fantastic Baggys, The Who, The Undertones, The Hobos, Tommy James and The Shondells, Helen Love, The Catalogs (from Hawaii, featuring Les Hernandez of The Quintessentials), The Banana Splits and many more.\n\nJoe Queer has been publicly outspoken against Nazism and white supremacy over the years as expressed in various interviews and in the song \"You're Tripping\" off of the 1993 Lookout Records release \"Love Songs for the Retarded\". The lyrics state \"I hate white power... Can't you see, this ain't Nazi Germany\".\n\nIn a 2014 open letter, Joe Steinhardt of Don Giovanni Records called on Asian Man Records and Recess Records to drop The Queers after Joe Queer made public statements in support of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Artist Mitch Clem, who had previously done work for the band, publicly broke ties as well. Steinhardt later apologized for the open letter, stating \"I remain personally appalled by Joe Queer's defense of Darren Wilson, his use of the term Obongo regarding the president...at the same time, I recognize that a better way to go about this would be more thoughtful discussion directly with the people involved.\" Joe Queer later called Steinhardt a 'gutless wimp' and challenged him to a face to face debate to be filmed and put online. Steinhardt has yet to respond.\n\nIn an interview with Noisey, after their February 2016 show was cancelled due to a call for a petition to boycott the show from a local collective, Babely Shades, Joe Queer voiced his opinion when asked if he \"supports racist, misogynistic or homophobic values?\" he replied \"Of course not. What normal minded person does? My closest pals here in Atlanta are Chris and Chester, two gay black guys. I was actually working a part time job. I was one of two white people on the whole job. If I was so racist, I wouldn't have worked there or be living in Atlanta! The whole city is predominantly black.\" He also voiced his opinion of the activist group Black Lives Matter, stating \n\"Black Lives Matter doesn't care about black people, they just want to cause trouble and hate white people. If they truly cared they'd be in the ghettos of America trying to help there instead of screaming about white America. That's where the murders of black people are happening, but according to BLM it's all white cops who are doing it! It's insane thinking and not getting to the root of the problem at all. All lives matter.\"\n\nIn a 2017 interview, Joe Queer stated \"“I get called a Nazi and racist because of our name, and then because I had an opinion about the Ferguson thing,” he says. “I’m liberal as hell, and I was taken aback by how quickly people attacked me. To this day, I’ll get snide comments. I was jumped by Nazis as a gay person, even though I’m not gay. I fought Nazis, so to be called a Nazi is lame by this alt-left.\" In the same interview he states that humor is a way to social change, we shouldn't take ourselves so seriously and that many people are looking for a reason to be offended, \"“In the old days of punk rock, all these bands were laughing at themselves, and they got their point across through humor,” King says. “The Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, the Circle Jerks, the Dickies, the Angry Samoans, Flipper, X — they were funny, but they had a message. They were laughing at themselves. I don’t think the new liberals are really offended. I think they’re just looking for a reason to say they’re offended. They completely take everything out of context. It’s so insincere, this faux outrage.\" \n\nSince its formation, the band has gone through a few line-up changes, with Joe Queer as the only constant member. The band currently consists of Joe Queer (Guitar/Vocals), Cheeto Bandito (Bass), and Hoglog Rehab (Drums). The first line-up was Joe Queer, Tulu, Keith Hages and Wimpy Rutherford. The mid-1980s line-up was Joe Queer, JJ Rassler, Hugh O'Neill with Kevin Kecy or Evan Shore. The best known line-up is from the 1990s Lookout Records era : Joe Queer, B-Face and Hugh O'Neill. After leaving Lookout Records, B-Face and Hugh O'Neill left and Dangerous Dave joined. The Queers continue to actively tour and a new record is in the works. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2093702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2093702", "title": "Toy balloon", "text": "Toy balloon\n\nA toy balloon or party balloon, is a small balloon mostly used for decoration, advertising and children's toys. Toy balloons are usually made of rubber or aluminized plastic, and inflated with air or helium. They come in a great variety of sizes and shapes, but are most commonly 10 to 30 centimetres in diameter. Toy balloons are not considered to include \"sky lanterns\" (hot-air paper balloons), although these too are or were used as child toys in some parts of the world.\n\nAccording to The Journal of the American Medical Association, out of 373 children who died in the US between 1972 and 1992 after choking on children's products, nearly a third choked on latex balloons. The Consumer Products Safety Commission found that children had inhaled latex balloons whole (often while trying to inflate them) or choked on fragments of broken balloons. \"Parents\", a monthly magazine about raising children, advised parents to buy Mylar balloons instead of latex balloons.\n\nEarly balloons were made from pig bladders and animal intestines. The Aztecs created the first balloon sculptures using cat intestines, which were then presented to the gods as a sacrifice. There are references to balloons made of whale intestine in \"Swiss Family Robinson\" (1813) and in \"Moby Dick\" (1851).\n\nThe first rubber balloons were made by Professor Michael Faraday in 1824 for use in his experiments with hydrogen at the Royal Institution in London. \"The caoutchouc is exceedingly elastic\", he wrote in the Quarterly Journal of Science the same year. \"Bags made of it...have been expanded by having air forced into them, until the caoutchouc was quite transparent, and when expanded by hydrogen they were so light as to form balloons with considerable ascending power...\" Faraday made his balloons by cutting round two sheets of rubber laid together and pressing the edges together. The tacky rubber welded automatically, and the inside of the balloon was rubbed with flour to prevent the opposing surfaces joining together.\n\nLatex rubber toy balloons were introduced by pioneer rubber manufacturer Thomas Hancock the following year in the form of a do-it-yourself kit consisting of a bottle of rubber solution and a condensing syringe. Vulcanized toy balloons, which unlike the earlier kind were unaffected by changes in temperature, were first manufactured by J.G. Ingram of London in 1847 and can be regarded as the prototype of modern toy balloons.\n\nIn the 1920s Neil Tillotson designed and produced a latex balloon with a cat's face and ears from a cardboard form which he cut by hand with a pair of scissors. He managed to make his first sale of these balloons with an order of 15 gross to be delivered for the annual Patriots Day Parade on April 19, 1931. The first colored balloons were sold at the 1933-34 Chicago World's Fair.\n\nInflatable foil balloons are made from plastics, such as aluminized PET film. Foil balloons are not elastic like rubber balloons, so that detailed and colorful pictures printed on their surfaces are not distorted when the balloon is inflated. Foil balloons are thus named because they sometimes have a metallic coating to make them shiny, however there have been concerns about metallic balloons causing short circuits when caught in overhead power lines. Because metallic balloons can cause power outages like on overhead catenary train lines , it is recommended that the metallic balloons not only be tied by a string or ribbon with no metal in it, but also securely tied down by a weight to prevent the balloon from floating away and some train operators either issue advisories on how to handle balloons or ban balloons altogether. When no longer required, it is recommended to cut the balloon to release the helium and dispose of in a garbage container.\n\nEvery toy balloon has an opening (or \"mouth\") through which gases are blown into it, followed by a connecting tube known as the \"neck\". Balloons are usually filled by using one's breath, a pump, or a pressurized gas tank. The opening can then be permanently tied off or clamped temporarily. Foil balloons are typically self-sealing. By filling a balloon with a gas lighter than air, such as helium, the balloon can be made to float. Helium is the preferred gas for floating balloons, because it is inert and will not catch fire (like hydrogen) or cause toxic effects when inhaled. Small, light objects (postcards, in balloon mail for example) are sometimes placed in balloons along with helium and released into the air and, when the balloon eventually falls, the object inside might be found by another person. Rubber balloons can also be filled with liquids (usually water) and can burst when they impact a solid object. Liquid-filled balloons are commonly referred to as water balloons or water bombs and used in playful fights, and sometimes vandalism.\n\nMost toy balloons are a simple oval-like shape. But balloon suppliers also offers other shapes for toy balloons. Some examples of other shapes are: \"zeppelins\" or \"airships,\" where balloons are usually longer than wide; \"espirals\" or \"rattlesnakes,\" similar to zeppelins, but much longer (not to be confused with balloons for twisting); \"hearts,\" balloons with the shape of a heart; \"dolls,\" two round shapes joined that represent a head and a body; \"mouseheads,\" composed of three round parts, one for the head and two for the ears; \"bunnyheads,\" similar to mouseheads but with long ears; \"bunny balloons,\" which resemble a stuffed toy bunny, having a big long shape for the body, a smaller shape for the head, and two long shapes for the ears; \"elephants,\" with two shapes for the body and the head, and a very long shape for the trunk; and \"ducks,\" with a big shape for the body, a smaller round shape for the head and smaller shape for the beak. There are many other possible shapes, depending on the manufacturers.\n\nThere are balloons that are longer and more cylindrical. These long balloons are often twisted and bent into simple, or intricate shapes which will hold their form when released. Balloon artists are people who quickly twist balloons into familiar or abstract shapes using the techniques of balloon modelling, usually for profit. Other names for balloon modeling include: balloon twisting, balloon bending, or simply twisting. \n\nArtists who practice balloon modeling are called: Balloon Twisters, Balloon Benders, Balloon Modeler and even have been referred to as a Latex Vessel Reconstruction Engineer.\n\nThe types of balloons used for this practice are pencil balloons and are called 160s, 260s, 350s, 360s, 660s or 646s. These number designations refer to the sizes of the balloons and roughly equate to the diameter and the length of the balloon when fully inflated. The 260, one of the most common animal balloon sizes, would be 2 inches in diameter and then 60 inches long when fully inflated. \n\nThe modeling balloons can be made into simple dogs, hearts, and swords or can be made into more intricate shapes such as dragons, cartoon characters, or even figments of the imaginations. More and more nearly anything is becoming possible with balloon twisting and it shows at major industry conventions such as Twist and Shout, the largest balloon twisting convention in the world.\n\nToy balloons are often characterized with its distinctive noises if manipulated in some ways. These noises include:\n\n\n\n\n\nToy balloons are used as decorations and/or advertising space. Balloons are usually purchased in deflated form, however, some party stores and vendors at special events will fill their balloons before selling them, this is called \"balloon stuffing\" where the balloons are filled with objects such as smaller balloons, teddy bears, etc.\n\nWhile toy balloons are primarily a toy, they are also sometimes used for demonstrations and experiments in classrooms. During the 19th century, it was thought that rubber balloons could be used to replace certain organs, but this was quickly disproved.\n\nToy balloons can be filled with water and used in a variety of ways, usually for fun. They can be thrown, or set up to drop on the head of an unsuspecting victim. Some Australians report using water balloons around their house during bushfires, as the heat of the flames breaks the balloon and causes the water to land on the fire.\n\nThere are water balloons which are balloons specifically designed to be filled with water.\n\n"}
{"id": "2446233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2446233", "title": "Traitté de l'origine des romans", "text": "Traitté de l'origine des romans\n\nPierre Daniel Huet's Trai[t]té de l'origine des Romans (\"Treatise on the Origin of Novels\", or \"Romances\") can claim to be the first history of fiction. It was originally published in 1670 as preface to Marie de la Fayette's novel \"Zayde\". The following will give extended excerpts from the English translation by Stephen Lewis published in 1715. The title page reads:\n\nPages i-xi gave a preface by Lewis, p.[xii] added “Corrigenda”, p. 1-149 offered the translation under the short title “Original of Romances”.\n\nThe excerpt is extensive and it will mainly serve students of literature interested in the scope of questions and the method of arguing the early historian of literature showed—Huet was a modern cultural historian, one could say. (The German parallel page offers a summary of the plot with selected quotes and might be more comprehensive):\n\nThe beginning of romances is to be searched for in a far distant past and of interest to “the Curious in Antiquity”\n\nThe treatise has found a wide audience in Latin and French translations. The new English translation is designed to attract a growing audience:\n\n\"Instruction\" is the next argument, yet Huet does not go into tedious details here. \"Virtue\" is placed against \"Vice\", \"Disgrace\" is to be avoided. The next step is the definition of \"Romance\" versus \"Epic Poem\". Both have one thing in common if one follows Aristotle's definition of Poesy: they are fictional:\n\nThe differences between histories and romances are connected with the fictional status—a problem is here caused by histories full of erroneous notions:\n\nHuet excludes Histories if the authors wanted to give rue accounts and just failed and he excludes \"fables\":\n\nThe following part of the treatise touches the origin of \"romances\". The peoples of Asia, especially those of Egypt had, so Huet claims, proven a tendency to decipher all kinds of information. The hieroglyphs prove that. Their whole religion and all their histories were deciphered, mostly to exclude the population from further knowledge. Initiations were afforded before one would gain access to the secret cultural knowledge Egypt stored. The Greeks | had been extremely eager to learn from Egypt:\n\nThe Arabs exploited the same cultural knowledge—their Koran is, so Huet says filled with knowledge one cannot understand without interpretation. The Arabs translated Greek fables into their language and via Arabia [p. 20] these materials finally reached Europe. This is proven by the fact that only after the occupation of Spain first romances appeared in southern France. Huet discusses Persias culture—as particularly obscure and full of secret knowledge, he mentions the Indians [p. 27] as particularly fond of poesy, before he speaks of the influence the \"Bible\" had on the western civilization and its love of fictions:\n\nHuet is extremely interested in changing tastes and in the relativity of judgments—he is far from any simple theory of cultural progress or decline. His concept is rather one of different functions knowledge and fictions can gain. Fables stood in the centre of his discussion so far. The next passages gain a wider perspective:\n\nThe ancient world developed a high cultural standard. Luxury commodities became important. Persia was the country of highest refinement, producing perfumes and dances before the Milesians imported much of that culture:\n\nOne does not have any material artefacts to prove this, yet the ancient historians help us here with their accounts. The Ionians influenced the Greeks. Alexander the Great did much to widen their cultural concepts. The \"Milesian Fables\" by Aristides of Miletus were finally translated into Latin. The book was criticized in Rome's Senate as hardly serving the purposes of a Rome involved in wars.\n\nHuet mentions names and develops a canon of texts and reaches Heliodorus who has to be compared with Jamblicus, the author of the Babylonics, which have only survived in fragments:\n\nAchilles Tatius' \"Leucippe and Clitophon\" enters the canon, and Huet is uncertain about the chronology of events:\n\nThen, referring to Longos and his \"Daphnis and Chloe:\"\n\nRome does not play more than a marginal role. Huet mentions \"Sybaritian Fables\" and the love fiction of Ovid, yet only Petronius wrote something like a \"romance\" in Latin. Ovid mentions a Roman esteem of romances, Huet's comment:\n\nThe ancient authors excelled with satires and texts which are no longer extant—a history which ended in darkness with the invasion of Germanic tribes causing the fall of the Roman empire:\n\nThe present age—the late 17th century—has learned to live with a differentiation between fiction and fact. The Middle Ages were marked by a completely different frame of mind. Huet reaches the stories written about king Arthur and Merlin:\n\nThe term romance was now invented—to denote the Spanish and French Language these texts were written in:\n\nThe idea of a tradition coming via Spain to Europe is thus balanced by a second option: [p. 108-09] Taliessin and Melkin were English heroes, Huet notes. The romances touching them must have been composed originally around 550.\n\nThe development into the 17th century gives the \"Amadis of Gaul\" a central position [p. 114-16] and leads to Cervantes \"Don Quixote\"—which is rather a critic of \"romances\" than a romance itself.\nThe following long passage gives Huet's picture of the intellectual network behind the rise of the modern novel—and of the traditions which now met:\n\nThe whole development of fiction is thus not one of continuities—but one of different traditions and complex reasons why fictions develop. Huet reaches the present age and passes through numerous titles:\n\nHuet has with this survey reached the end of his treatise. D'Urfee and Mademoiselle de Scudery become important here:\n\nThe last lines refer to the following \"history\" \"Zayde\"—which will, so Huet, deserve all praise:\n\n...which is the final sentence.\n\n"}
