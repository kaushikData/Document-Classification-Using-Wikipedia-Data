In the film voiceover actor Don LaFontaine picks up four other voiceover actors in his limo to travel to the awards. The actors talk about themselves and the awards, making humorous references to common phrases and techniques they use when voicing movie trailers. Besides LaFontaine, the other actors appearing in the film are John Leader, Nick Tate, Mark Elliot, and Al Chalk. Hal Douglas provides his voice for a telephone call, but does not appear.\n\nThe limousine in the film is LaFontaine's. The driver is Clinton Hendricks, LaFontaine's personal sound engineer and driver.\n\nThe film's original purpose was to serve as an introductory sketch for the 1997 \"The Hollywood Reporter\" Key Art Awards broadcast. According to John Leader, the sketch played to a packed house at the awards ceremony and was so well received that the next day, bootlegged copies began circulating around the Internet; to date, one copy of the film has nearly one million views on YouTube alone. In addition, the five voiceover artists, many of whom had few on-camera credits to their names prior to \"5 Men and a Limo\", had become instantly recognizable; LaFontaine went on to do on-screen appearances in commercials for GEICO as \"that announcer guy from the movies\", while Leader has done on-screen commercials for Burger King and Kudos granola bars.\n\nThe short film opens with the \"James Bond Theme,\" before transitioning into the theme from \"Back to the Future\" after the show's opening graphics. When Hal Douglas is heard phoning LaFontaine, the familiar intro to the \"Theme from New York, New York\" is heard on the music track as a subtle indication of Douglas' East Coast management. This is abruptly interrupted by a sample from the 1985 electronica song \"Oh Yeah\" by Swiss band Yello, once LaFontaine ignores Douglas and introduces Al Chalk. An excerpt from the score of \"Groundhog Day\" is heard when Mark Elliot enters the film. Otherwise the score from \"\" is heard in the background during many of the voiceovers provided by the limousine's passengers.\n\n"}

It was the first computer generated television station identification in the world.\n\nThe ident package was launched in June 1979. The ident was aired through a solid-state computer device, not unlike the one used later for BBC1's Computer Originated World, built by BBC engineers, and designed by Oliver Elmes. The concept of the double striped '2' had been around for a long time: following the two television channels dropping corporate branding, a similar look was adopted by both channels featuring double striped numbers and BBC letters. The doubled striped '2' had been in use on programme promotions since 1977 and on holding slides since 1978.\n\nThe ident itself featured a cream, double striped numeral 2, with two orange lines either side going off screen. The whole ident had the illusion of three dimensions, with orange shadows, all on a black background. The ident would either remain static, scroll in from the left hand side or scroll out to the right. The form up ident was accompanied by an electronic fanfare, which was dropped in 1983. A subtitled programme would be accompanied by the additional caption below the numeral stating 'Ceefax 270' and later following a change of page 'Ceefax 888'.\n\nThe clock which accompanied this new look was located in the BBC Two Noddy room and comprised an orange clock face with counters of ever increasing thickness and with a 'polo' mint centre upon a black background. A plain orange and white 2D striped '2' logo was placed below the clock. The use of this old clock was due to the fact that the technology did not exist for an electronic timepiece, and would not until 1980, when an electronic timepiece was finally obtained for BBC2. This new electronic clock had no second hand judder and had a changed design, featuring two dashes at the quarter hours and single dashes elsewhere. The polo mint centre was abandoned in favour of a simple centre dot, and the 3D striped '2' logo adorned the bottom of the screen, although it was unanimated.\n\nPromotional style wasn't uniform, but generally featured the striped '2' in the promotion in one form or another, whether at the beginning or appearing on the end slide. Programme slides featured a large white 2 with programme title overlaid the bottom of the image.\n\nA variation of the look was used during the Daytime on 2 strand showing schools programmes, which featured the ident with an orange gradient background. Regional variations of BBC2 featured the region name below the 2.\n\nThe variation in 2010 is this look recreated using 3D software.\n\nSome special versions were produced for public celebrations such as Christmas:\n\n\nThe ident was re-used in early 2005 for the opening continuity announcement in the second series of the period comedy \"Look Around You\".\n\nIt was recreated in May 2010, with a new soundtrack, as part of BBC Two's \"80's Season\", to celebrate events and features from the decade.\n\nIt was then brought back twice in October 2012, with no soundtrack. The first occasion was only shown in Northern Ireland on 10 October at 12:20am, to mark the start of their digital switchover, hence bringing BBC Two NI's time on analogue television to a close. The second was shown nationally on 22 October at 4:35am to lead into the final edition of \"Pages From Ceefax\". And on 7 October 2013, this (and its Christmas '79, '84 & '85 ident in NI), along with others was brought back for BBC Two's \"Afternoon Classics\" block.\n\n"}

Theo has a confusing relationship with school friend Simone, with fans vocally unsure whether there is more to them than just friends. Humble, likeable yet with a hint of naivety he provides a necessary balance to the four main friends.\n\nZephryn Taitte portrays Dorian Kerr an accountant who works with Theo at the same multimedia company. Intelligent and well-read he assumes the role of life analyst and often uses his interest in psychology and conspiracy theories to theorise on just about everything. His love for Arsenal rivals his hate for work, especially his boss Michael who he shares awkward competitive scenes with. Dorian dates a number of women despite being picky, yet his heart lies with childhood friend Lisa, who he subsequently fails to make his girlfriend for most of the series.\n\nDavid Avery plays Marcus Graham, a men’s fashion magazine intern turned content editor. Charismatic, Confident and Cocky with self-proclaimed good looks, he is the charmer of the friends. He likes his women to compliment his attempted lifestyle and often goes for the fashionable, high maintenance and trophy types. His necessity to lie about who he is to get women almost always backfires on him in the long run with his conquests in the series ranging from crazy to young.\n\nIsaac Sosanya plays Junior Casey Owusu, a freelance IT Consultant. He is funny, social but collected, making him both the quietest and joker of the group. Junior’s confidence is dealt a blow at the start of the series, as we find him still reeling off the break-up of his childhood sweetheart Vanessa. He subsequently dates Remy and builds a relationship with her until Vanessa comes back into his life. Junior spends the series contending with his choices and the effects they have on his life and those around him life.\n\nNatalie Duvall plays Lisa Bowman, a teacher and part-times events organiser. She is often referred to as the mother hen, as she loves to bring all her friends together to cook for them. She is a hopeless romantic, always trying to hook up the guys and longs for a relationship of her own.

She subsequently goes on to date Leon in the series.\n\nDani Moseley plays Simone Charles, a heralded youth worker in her community. Alongside Lisa she is a childhood friends of the guys.

She spends the series trying to win Junior back, after realising he may not be as over as her as he claims.\n\nSolomon Israel plays Darren Dickson, an old school friend of the guys. He is confident, a jokester and spontaneous, often wanting to go out on wild nights and trips. He is introduced to the series as Simone’s ex-boyfriend and we soon learn about his uncommitted dynamic with women. He represents the guy Marcus wants to be. The source of Darren’s regular income is unknown and despite his womanising ways, he takes great pride in having fun and making people happy.\n\nThe first season introduces the four main characters and three supporting characters. Theo is finding it hard to find the right woman, with his workmate Nicole taking advantage of his good nature and Simone making fun of his masculinity. He finds solace in Charlotte, a singer who he meets at a cashpoint and a relationship blossoms. Marcus begins dating Nia off of the back of a lie about his job role yet refuses to confess his commitment to her to his friends. A strange turn of events reveal that he’s not the only one lying in their rendezvous. Dorian is struggling with work, women and his feelings towards Lisa. He attempts and fails throughout the season to tell Lisa how he really feels until there is a threat to her singledom, when a man enters the fray. Junior spends most of the season unable to get over his ex-girlfriend Vanessa until he meets Remy at a speed dating event. A relationship blossoms between them but his ex-girlfriend shows up and gives him an ultimatum.\n\nThe second season begins with Junior making a decision between Remy and Vanessa. After telling Vanessa he chooses Remy, Vanessa presents him with an offer he can’t refuse. We spend the season wondering what happened between them until the finale when Vanessa confesses to Remy exactly what that something was. Marcus breaks up with Nia and finally gets a full-time role for his company. He befriends Michelle, a co-worker he eventually has feelings for but is thwarted by the return of Darren, who visits him and gets the attention of Michelle. Marcus goes to a club with Dorian and Darren and meets Sinitta, a sexy and voluptuous teacher who is potentially more of a threat to Marcus than a conquest. Theo flies to Jamaica for a family wedding after being given the boot by Charlotte, he delays his return to London after finding himself a suitable girlfriend finally. He returns to London for the season finale with his girlfriend Monique, but she may be having second thoughts on whether she wants to come back home for good. Dorian and Lisa reluctantly agree to be friends and he begins dating Shirene but it comes to an abrupt halt when they have an impromptu double date with Lisa and her new boyfriend Leon. Dorian befriends a new girl at Marcus’ surprise birthday party and they begin dating, but when Leon proposes to Lisa unexpectedly in the series finale, Dorian’s feelings come to the forefront.\n\nAccording to the production company BWNG Ltd website, Season 3 picks up where Season 2 left off, with Junior, Dorian and Theo having to answer tough questions about their current life situations…and fast. Joined by good old friend Darren, the season explores the challenges of being “actual adults” – since the past decade, has been filled with mediocrity and lack of commitment. The show is scheduled to be broadcast on TRACE Play, in the summer of 2017.\n\nElizabeth Pears of The Voice Newspaper celebrated the positive imagery of young males by describing the show as \"a voice that reflected a generation of young black men in their 20s – who weren’t locked in a cycle of gang rivalries.\" In 2012 the show was featured on US cable show 'The Attack Show' by Baratunde Thurston, with positive feedback from the panel consisting of Senior Writer of Entertainment Weekly Anthony Breznican and Editor In Chief of Birth.Movies.Death Devin Faraci. Devin Faraci commented that the show was 'actually good (I'd say it's the only \"good\" thing recommended in the segment).' Anthony Breznican goes on to respond ‘I think its great, but also it is very British. It’s not just about black culture, but it's also about being a young British guy…”\n\nAs the series progressed, Brothers With No Game received National press coverage in The Guardian, with the writer asking the question of why the show was not on UK television, despite its success online.\n\nIn 2014, the main cast of Brothers With No Game were featured on BBC Radio 1xtra with Nick Bright, where each actor speed dated with guest host Sian Anderson.\n\nIn May 2017, an academic research on screen comedy audiences featured a chapter on the shows and its audiencen in the context of 'the marginalisation of blackness on British television'. \"Screen Comedy and Online Audiences\", by Dr Inger-Lise Kalviknes Bore, also looks at how online distribution is providing alternative spaces for the development of black-centred narratives.\n\nThe Brothers With No Game received positive feedback from the industry whilst on YouTube, going on to win 6 awards at the LA Web Festival in 2012. The show went on to win more accolades, most notably winning Best Ensemble and Best Actor award for Zephryn Taitte, at the 2014 Screen Nation Digital-iS media award.\n\nSeason 1 and 2 of Brothers With No Game was aired on YouTube in June 2012, and as of May 2015 the channel has received 1.12m views.

It is performed in different styles.\n\nClassical Indian musical theatre theory can be traced back to the Natya Shastra of Bharata Muni (400 BC). The Sangeet Natak Akademi currently confers classical status on eight styles:\n\n\nClassical Indian musical theatre at its best is Natya Yoga, has the most powerful means to lead its worshipers, the artist, to the Divine. It is a sincere depiction of the Divine. It is a sincere depiction of the realities in life, an embodiment of the imagination and gracefulness, the very soul which thereby creates as it were the “Idol of the Beautiful”.\n\nWhile Bharatanatyam, Odissi and Kuchipudi are the orthodox styles that claim to preserve the knowledge of the Natya Shastra most faithfully, Kathak is different from other styles as it is a mixture of the Persian dance and the Indian folk dance movements. It derives its name from the community of Kathaks, who are custodians of the art. It is from this house (ghar) or family that this form has taken its origin. The words Kathak and Kathakali are derived from katha meaning storytelling and kali meaning play. The Kathak dance style was founded by the master Maharaj Binda Din. Kathak dancing performed by a dancer who stands and moves about and lasya (the aspect) in which the dancer kneels or remains immobile the whole time except for the (gat) a descriptive passage, performed in a gentle rhythm and tells stories with his expressive powers only, with his face and hands.\n\nOn the physical side the dancer must have perfect control of his body and limbs, which is achieved at least 12 years of study. Special massage is given to the feet. The Kathakali technique of using the face expression is a pure marvel of accomplishment. Some ancient masters of this dance have such control of their facial muscles that they can laugh with one side and cry with the other. Every Kathakali must be master of both tandava (vigorous masculine style at changing from one style to another). Lasya is divided into two categories; one suitable for men (for presenting love scenes, displays of sympathy and sentimed and so on) and the other for women who take female roles. Therefore, women may study Kathakali but do not take part in the pure dance drama which is too vigorous and difficult for them. Indian dancing is not just physical movements of hands and legs, it is a form of physical art with body and mind for both men and women alike as well as a form of worship to the Almighty Divine Gods.\n\nAn important feature of Indian classical dances is the use of Mudras or hand gestures. Mudras are used by the artists to express their feeling or even the whole story.\n\nAncient Sanskrit drama had a highly stylized nature with an emphasis on spectacle, where music, dance and gesture combined \"to create a vibrant artistic unit with dance and mime being central to the dramatic experience.\" Sanskrit dramas were known as \"natya\", derived from the root word \"nrit\" (dance), characterizing them as spectacular dance-dramas.\n\nTraditional folk theatre became popular from around the 10th century with the decline of Sanskrit theatre. These regional traditions include the \"Yatra\" of Bengal, the \"Ramlila\" of Uttar Pradesh, and the \"Terukkuttu\" of Tamil Nadu. In particular, Parsi theatre \"blended realism and fantasy, music and dance, narrative and spectacle, earthy dialogue and ingenuity of stage presentation, integrating them into a dramatic discourse of melodrama. The Parsi plays contained crude humour, melodious songs and music, sensationalism and dazzling stagecraft.\" These traditions in musical theatre have continued in modern Indian cinema, particularly in musical films produced by Bollywood.\n\nIn modern days, Kathakali is also learned and performed by women.\n\nClassical Indian musical theatre had a profound influence on shaping the conventions of Indian popular cinema, particularly in Bollywood and South Indian musical films:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22307021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22307021", "title": "French theatre of the late 18th century", "text": "French theatre of the late 18th century\n\nThe French theatre of the late 18th century functioned as a forum for political expression and debate; during this period, society and art became highly politicised. The French took great national pride in their theatres. A report commissioned by the Commune of Paris in 1789 declared Paris to be a centre for the \"foremost theatres of Europe\" that served as an \"exemplar for foreigners.\" An audience's response to the play was important to its success—if a play was received poorly (\"claques\"), rather than favourably (\"cabales\"), the play would not receive royalty payments.\n\nBefore the creation of the National Assembly in 1789, the monarchy supported only three theatres in Paris: the Académie Royale de Musique (Paris Opera), the Comédie-Italienne, and the Comédie-Française. Royal patronage resulted in a monopoly over the theatre and safeguarded the monarch from mockery and criticism. It was not until the late 1780s that this system was criticised for preventing the success and freedom enjoyed by theatres elsewhere.\n\nThe government of the \"Ancien Régime\" attempted to silence a growing political unrest. In an attempt to rid society of the disruption caused by \"\"honnêtes hommes\",\" the lieutenant-general of police, Marc-Pierre de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson, tried to control the behaviour of spectators in theatres. This resulted in a temporary lull in politicised drama. Nearly all of the top fifty plays of the decade had nothing to do with the Revolution and were uncritical and silent about the revolutionary ideals of liberty.\n\nWith the introduction of the Chapelier Law in 1791, the National Assembly instituted the freedom of theatres, which could now function without governmental interference or censorship. A dramatic increase in the number of theatres followed, from fourteen in Paris in 1791 to thirty-five in 1792. As a result of the law, the censor now expressed not the absolute will of the monarch but the more negotiable, democratic preferences of the nation.\n\nThe physical space of a theatre in France during the Enlightenment allowed a large number of people to attend. With capacities of up to two thousand audience members, the theatre was an important arena for the French community. During this time, nearly fifty new theatres opened, over one thousand plays were written, and approximately twenty-four plays were performed on a daily basis. Giving the working class access to the theatre meant opening it to their demands. Ravel calls the pit the \"parterre\", where the working class could participate in the performance by voicing their reactions in an unmediated, sometimes aggressive way, thus anticipating in some form the coming Revolution. This group embodied the revolutionary spirit for direct democracy and subsequently became an important political actor, confounding the hierarchies of royal authority.\n\nA Parisian citizen during the Enlightenment may have attended the theatre principally for two reasons: firstly, its aesthetic value as an awe-inspiring spectacle and secondly, because of its political suggestiveness. When drama lacked this latter aspect, it was criticised for distracting audiences from the pressing public political issues of the time. For example, a petition was sent to the National Assembly regarding Paisiello's flashy opera \"Nina, osia la pazza d’amore\", because it lacked political and educational meaning. This resulted in the opera's closure in 1792 and the National Assembly banned theatre that did not incorporate the events of the Revolution.\n\nFrench theatre became full of \"\"pieces de circonstance\",\" or \"works of social circumstances,\" particularly where the events of the military were concerned. For example, in December 1793, a member of the Committee for Public Safety, Bertrand Barère, demanded that playwrights create work about the French capture of Toulon. Seven new plays were subsequently written about the battle, including \"La prise de Toulon\", which made direct references to political leaders and philosophers. Aubin-Louis Millin de Grandmaison claimed that \"tragedy should teach great political truths and public virtues. If they want to express a powerful idea, tragic authors are therefore obliged to torment their genius, to cloak their idea with a veil of allegory\" \nWhile French theatre was praised for its ability to engage in the political debates of its time, it was also criticised by members of the aristocracy for corrupting the public sphere. A notable proponent of this notion was Jean Jacques Rousseau, who, in his \"Letter to M. D'Alembert on Spectacles\", argued that theatre could not improve the morality of the audience and instead could only re-inforce their existing beliefs. He was enraged by Molière's \"Le Misanthrope\" for the way it praised the hypocritical character Philinte at the expense of Alcest, the honest character in the play.\n\nThe worlds of politics and drama converged, since some leading playwrights of this period were also politicians. For example, tragedian Marie-Joseph Chenier belonged to the Paris Jacobins and was elected to the National Convention; Collot d'Herbois wrote both comedies and tragedies, while being an active member of the Committee for Public Safety; and interior minister François de Neufchâteau was also a popular playwright of the time.\n\nTheatrics also played a large role in politics, in terms of the way political speeches and campaigns were carried out. Politicians of the time, such as the Marquis de Mirabeau, used the public's ability to be captivated by the theatre to arouse support for their regimes. In fact, in a production called \"Assemblée fédérative\", citizens were allowed to pay to role-play as great speakers of the Enlightenment, re-enacting debates and speeches of propaganda. Inevitably, this situation resulted in a mockery of politics, and performances where actors played the parts of politicians were often controversial.\n\nAlong with the theatricality of politics, the role of drama in French society is reflected in the theatrical portrayal of the visions and beliefs of the National Convention regarding surveillance. The content of Revolutionary plays also reflected the beliefs of Jean Jacques Rousseau and the Age of Enlightenment. As described by Rousseau, surveillance provides the means through which the authenticity and goodness of the person can be constituted, recognized and affirmed. These ideas regarding surveillance resonated with Revolutionary culture, as there was a general push for complete visibility. The power of surveillance was thought to be shared by all citizens and was considered by many to be the single most important means to protect the Revolution from counter-revolutionary citizens and would-be usurpers.\n\nAlong with \"L’Époux républicain\", plays such as \"Plus de bâtards en France\", and \"La Veuve du républicain, ou, Le Calomniateur\" all reflected the Convention’s belief that surveillance in the private sphere was extremely important to the transparency of the Revolution. The Convention believed that citizens needed to police themselves and their peers, and then had a duty to report counterrevolutionaries. This was all encouraged in order to continue the safety and well-being of the Republic. Robespierre was particularly consumed with both the elimination of theatricality from the government and the elimination of the distance between the representatives and the people that they represented. Therefore, the aforementioned plays were encouraged and accepted.\n\"L'Époux républicain\" was one play in particular that was enormously popular and very effective at portraying the importance of the acceptance of surveillance. The main character’s wife, Mélisse, has an affair and is also revealed to be counter-revolutionary, showing the link between immoral activity and treason. There were also characters within these plays that questioned whether or not surveillance was ethical or warranted. However, the characters that endorsed this surveillance were the ones that the plays portrayed as the moral, just, and ultimately correct citizens. Revolutionary drama depicted domestic life as inherently connected to political life, which in turn linked the practice of surveillance to the protection of the Revolution. Theater was considered a machine for propaganda to further the beliefs and ideals of the Revolution and its leaders.\n\nAlternatively, there were plays that provided a critique of surveillance, such as \"La Chaste Suzanne\", a play which actually caused riots because of supposed counter-revolutionary messages. \"La Chaste Suzanne\" cast an unfavorable light on two elected officials engaged in the surveillance of the main character, Suzanne, during a private moment in a bath. The officials attempt to extort sexual favors from Suzanne and when she refuses, they denounce her and allege that she was having an affair with a young man. Suzanne is brought to trial for adultery and is almost stoned to death before a sympathetic lawyer comes to her rescue and reveals the nefarious plot. This play represented a rejection of the ideas of surveillance encouraged by the government and society (embodied by the spying officials invading Suzanne’s privacy), and was thus seen as counter-revolutionary. The play was staged in a very momentous time in Revolutionary history - King Louis XVI had recently been tried and executed and the lines separating the Jacobin and Girondin values began to widen and cause animosity.\n\nDue to the atmosphere of the Terror, and the subject matter of the play, riots began to break out condemning the performance. Even one of the actors in the play wrote a letter detailing citizens’ disgruntled reactions in the crowd upon hearing certain lines of the play they believed associated the play’s heroine, Suzanne, with Marie Antoinette. Patriots showed their discontent with the counter-revolutionary ideas in the play by storming the stage with drawn swords and threatening to turn the theatre into a hospital if they play continued. The Convention voted to ban \"La Chaste Suzanne\" after complaints that it disrupted the public order and was morally corrupt. Shortly after it was banned, on September 27, 1793, Pierre-Yves Barré, one of those responsible for the staging the performance and several actors and writers including the Radet and Desfontaines-Lavallée, were arrested for staging plays filled with \"perfidious allusions\".\n\nIn addressing the National Assembly in early 1791, the aforementioned Mirabeau declared that \"when the time comes for us to concern ourselves with the education of the masses, in which the theatre must play its part, it will be seen that drama can be transformed into a very active, very rigorous morality.\" \n\nAs Mirabeau’s declaration suggests, the revolutionary governments used theatre to promote republican ideology and morality. According to F.W.J. Hemmings, in the plays produced in Paris between 1793 and 1794, over two-thirds conveyed a political message. However, the question of what constituted a drama that espoused proper political messages and appropriate republican morals ultimately fell to the government. Consequently, in its efforts to utilize the theatre for political ends, the government became repressive, much in the same way that the monarchy had been. Because the theatre was viewed as a tool of political advancement, plays that did not purify public morals or politically align with the central government became censored in some way. Plays were either outright banned, or altered to remove any references to the defunct institutions of the \"Ancien Régime\" and to better promote republican morals, as was often the case with familiar classics such as Molière’s \"Tartuffe\". Prior to August 1793, the central government enforced such censorship through repressive means. Because of the Chapelier Law of 1791, passed under the National Assembly, abolishing the censorship of theatre, the government had to justify its censorship through claims that a particular dramatic performance caused a public disturbance.\n\nThis was the case with the play \"L’Ami des Lois\". As the controversial trial of the King was taking place in early 1793, Jean-Louis Laya created the play \"L’Ami des Lois\" as an attack on the growing Jacobin extremism of the time and as an expression of his desire for renewed moderation and liberty with order. This challenged the authority of the revolutionary power structures that were becoming increasingly dominated by Jacobin radicals. In the play, these radical Jacobins are depicted as self-interested and calculating villains, while the former aristocrats are portrayed as patriotic. Complaints arose, and under the pretext that the play was causing public disturbance, the Paris Commune, predominantly controlled by Jacobins, banned it. This occurred on January 10, 1793, only eight days after its first production. Playwright Laya protested what he considered an arbitrary censorship to his play. He criticized the new censorship undertaken by the revolutionary French government as more despotic than that of the institutions of the Ancien Régime. Although a supporter of the early stages of the Revolution, Laya’s \"L’Ami des Lois\", and subsequent criticisms of the government, resulted in his official denunciation by Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois, a member of the Committee of Public Safety. To avoid punishment, Laya went into hiding and did not reappear until after the radical Reign of Terror had come to an end.\n\nCensorship of the theatre only increased in the following months, paralleling the radicalization of the Revolution during the Reign of Terror. On August 2, 1793, the recently formed Committee of Public Safety passed a decree introducing penalties to theatres producing plays contrary to republican ideology by proclaiming that \"every theatre in which plays are performed that tend to lower public morale and to revive the shameful superstition of monarchy shall be closed, and the directors arrested and punished in accordance with the full rigor of the law.\" Furthermore, the following month, the Committee of Public Safety granted the Commune the task of preemptively previewing plays to ensure that they followed republican ideology and did not include any critiques of the current administration. This marked a shift from repressive censorship to that of preventive censorship, carried out in the name of the Republic. Even while undertaking preventive censorship measures, the National Convention continued to promote plays that aligned with its political and moral creed.\n\nThe play \"Guillaume Tell\" by Antoine-Marin Lemierre, which displayed popular themes of the struggle against tyranny, revolt, sacrifice and liberty, is an example of a play promoted by both the Convention and the Committee of Public Safety. Productions of \"Guillaume Tell\" were actually subsidized by the state, as it was one of several plays deemed by the government to best propagate revolutionary ideals. Following the precedent set by the earlier revolutionary governments, even the more moderate government that came to power during the Thermidorian Reaction continued to censor and support plays of its choosing.\n\nPaul Friedland suggests that actors in the time of the \"Ancien Régime\" were expected to experience the emotions that they were portrayed on-stage. In 1750, however, critics such as Denis Diderot and François Riccoboni argued that the emotions presented on-stage should be illusionary. Friedland argues that by the time of the creation of the National Assembly there was a metaphorical \"fourth wall\" that divided an awed audience from the actors who created illusions of reality. Friedland interprets this change as resulting from the emergence of revolutionary politics. He calls pre-revolutionary France a \"corpus mysticum,\" or a \"mystical body,\" that was subject only to the will of the monarchy, aristocracy, and clergy. During the Revolution, he continues, power shifted to the \"parlementaires\", who began to operate behind a political \"fourth wall\", still removed from the actual interests of citizens. Just as audiences in a theatre would suspend their disbelief for the spectacle of the show, so too did citizens begin to have blind faith in the National Assembly's representation of national will.\n\nFriedland uses Marie-Joseph Chénier's play \"Charles IX\", which expresses an anti-monarchical attitude, as an example of the controversy that the \"fourth wall\" created. When actors refused to participate in the play, the National Assembly and other political organizations intervened, defying the Chapelier law that outlawed government intervention in theatre.\n\nCritics of the theatre argued that the divide between spectators and performers not only reflected, but encouraged the separation between citizens and government. The remodelling of the Théâtre Feydeau in 1789, for example, removed audience boxes on-stage so that the audience was more confined to an area separate from the stage. This change, they argued, signified the lack of transparency of the \"Ancien Régime\". Maximilien Robespierre was an advocate for public vigilante surveillance over the government and so was against this counter-revolutionary form of theatre. Susan Maslan, utilising the theories of Michel Foucault, argues that the shift from the \"Ancien Régime\" to the post-revolutionary system signified a \"shift from a regime of spectacle to a regime of surveillance.\".\n\n\n"}

A prequel film, \"\", was released on June 5, 2015.\n\nIn 1986, Lorraine Lambert summons demonologist Elise Rainier to help her son Josh, who is being followed by the spirit of an old woman. After investigating the house and encountering paranormal phenomena, Elise tells Lorraine that they must suppress Josh's astral projection abilities for his own safety.\n\nTwenty-five years later, Renai Lambert is under questioning about the death of Elise. She is warned that if her husband Josh's fingerprints are found at the crime scene, he will be prosecuted for Elise's murder. The Lambert family relocate to Lorraine's house as the investigation continues. Renai and the others begin to experience strange, seemingly paranormal activity in the house.\n\nSpecs and Tucker visit Elise's house and discover a videotape of the 1986 investigation. Upon reviewing it, they find someone standing behind Josh in the video. The next morning, Dalton tells Renai that he has been having bad dreams involving a woman in a white dress; as well as hearing Josh talk to an unseen figure in the hallway. Renai receives a call from the police stating that the fingerprints do not match Josh. The woman in the white dress appears and attacks Renai. Josh hears a voice urging him to kill his family.\n\nLorraine visits Specs and Tucker and they show her the tape, enhanced to show an adult Josh as the figure standing behind the young Josh. They contact Elise's former colleague Carl, who attempts to contact Elise's spirit. They are told to find answers at an abandoned hospital where Lorraine used to work as a doctor. Upon arriving, Lorraine recounts the story of a patient named Parker Crane who was admitted for trying to castrate himself. Two days later, Lorraine saw Parker in an elevator. When Lorraine asked a nurse why Parker was out of his bed, the nurse explained that he had jumped to his death from the roof the day before.\n\nLorraine and the group go to the Crane family home where they find a secret room. Inside they discover numerous corpses, a black wedding gown and newspaper clippings revealing Parker to be a killer referred to as \"The Bride in Black\" - who kidnapped and murdered young women while dressed as a woman himself. Josh's body begins to slowly deteriorate and Renai realizes he is possessed. Lorraine insists that they all get away from Josh. Carl arrives to drug him, accompanied by Specs and Tucker, but Josh manages to subdue all three. Carl awakes in the spirit realm of \"The Further\", where he meets the spirit of the real Josh. Josh travels to his daughter Cali's room in \"The Further\", where an evil spirit is approaching her. He struggles with the spirit but is overpowered. Elise's spirit arrives and banishes the spirit from the house. It is revealed that these actions are what triggered some of the mysterious events in the first film, as time moves non-chronologically in the Further.\n\nIn the real world, Josh, who is possessed by Parker, ambushes Lorraine and Renai, locking Lorraine in a closet. Renai and the children escape to the basement. Dalton voluntarily enters The Further to help his father. In The Further, Josh, Carl, and Elise try to track Parker down by revisiting Josh in 1986, with the young Josh showing the adult Josh where to find him.

Carl and Josh escape, only to find Dalton, who leads them back to the living world, allowing Josh to finally regain control of his body. The Lambert family is finally reunited, with Josh and Dalton allowing themselves to once again have their memories suppressed by Carl.\n\nSome time later, Specs and Tucker arrive at the house of a family whose daughter, Allison, is in an unexplained coma. Unbeknownst to them, Elise's spirit enters. She hears a crackling sound and gasps as she sees something standing in the shadows.\n\nAfter the financial success of \"Insidious\" In April 2011, discussions for a sequel soon followed. With producer Jason Blum insisting on the return of director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell, a treatment script did not arrive until nearly a year later. \"As long as there was a chance that James and Leigh were gonna write the second movie and direct the second movie, I didn't want to do it with someone else,\" said Blum. \"They kept saying they might do it, they might not do it, which was why there's quite a bit of time between the two movies.\" On February 2, 2012, it was announced that director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell were in talks to return for the sequel.\n\nWhile promoting \"The Conjuring\" (2013) at New York Comic Con in October 2012, Wan described how he and Whannell were working closely on developing the story and the script for the follow up to \"Insidious\", explaining to ShockTilYouDrop.com, \"I think the sequel to \"Insidious\" is kind of my reaction to \"Saw\" where for my own reason I wasn't as involved in the sequels, and so I felt with \"Insidious\", think it would be good to shepherd it and keep it more in track to the version I had when I made the first film so that it doesn't detour too far.\"\n\nThe film was titled \"Insidious: Chapter 2\" because it is a direct continuation of the first installment. However, the tone of the film was to be more grounded than in the first film, with Wan citing his work on \"The Conjuring\" as an influence to how he and Whannell approached \"Insidious: Chapter 2\". \"I pulled things from \"Insidious\" that I applied to \"The Conjuring\", and what I learned from \"The Conjuring\" I applied to \"Insidious 2\",\" said Wan. \"So for me, I feel like it's a cumulative filmmaking experience that I've gathered over the years.\"\n\nOn November 19, 2012, it was officially announced that Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shaye, and Ty Simpkins would reprise their roles from the first film. The following month, it was announced that Barbara Hershey would also be returning. In February 2013, Jocelin Donahue and Lindsay Seim rounded out the cast as younger versions of Hershey and Shaye's characters, respectively. It was also confirmed that the film's screenwriter Leigh Whannell and actor Angus Sampson would reprise their roles as Specs and Tucker, respectively. When asked about the return of the two characters, Whannell explained, \"There was this hatred that spewed out from fans saying 'I hated those guys! They sucked! They ruined the movie!' so there will probably be a lot of people out there who will be disappointed to hear that the Specs and Tucker characters will be coming back.\"\n\nPrincipal photography for \"Insidious: Chapter 2\" began on January 15, 2013, in Los Angeles. Having a slightly higher production budget than its predecessor, the film was captured over the course of 25 shooting days. A bulk of the film was shot at a house in Highland Park, Los Angeles, which served as the location of Lorraine Lambert's house. Another location used for filming was the former Linda Vista Community Hospital, which was redressed as a hospital setting and used for the construction of interior sets (including recreations of sets from the first film). \"I've never shot in Linda Vista,\" said Wan about the location. \"It's kind of funny because Leigh and I have always heard so much about it. For research on the first one [Leigh] came here to do a bit of ghost-hunting. And I think a lot of that inspired us when we needed a hospital set.\"\n\nThe musical score to \"Insidious: Chapter 2\" is composed by Joseph Bishara, who previously collaborated with director James Wan on the first installment as well as \"The Conjuring\". \"Finding the right range and tone for the feeling is an important part,\" described Bishara on generating tension through sound. \"James is very particular with sting placement along with Kirk, our editor on both \"Insidious\" films and \"Conjuring\". Silence can create a listening space, where rather than give you something else to listen to it enables you to hear things.\"\n\nA soundtrack album for the film was released digitally on September 15 and in physical forms on October 8, 2013 by Void Recordings. Additional songs featured in the film include:\n\nPrior to being officially announced, Sony Pictures Entertainment registered various domain names on November 28, 2011, for \"Insidious: Chapter 2\". On January 30, 2013, the first picture from the set of the film was released via writer Leigh Whannell's Twitter account. Additional behind-the-scenes photos from the set of the film were released the following month. In April 2013, the first promotional poster for the film went on display at CinemaCon in Las Vegas. The first theatrical trailer for the film was screened to a live audience on location at the Linda Vista Community Hospital on June 4, 2013, with an online release the following day. On August 10, 2013, it was announced at the convention Scare L.A by producer Jason Blum and Universal's creative director John Murdy, that a maze attraction entitled \"Insidious: Into the Further\" will be featured at the 2013 Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood.\n\nWhile originally intended to be released on August 30, 2013, \"Insidious: Chapter 2\" was rescheduled for a September 20 release date. The film's release date was later moved again to September 13, 2013.\n\nOn the night prior to its theatrical wide release, the film was shown in select theatres as part of a double feature with the first installment. A red carpet premiere for the film was held in Los Angeles on September 10, 2013.\n\nPreliminary reports had the film tracking for a $32–$35 million debut in North America. The film earned $1.5 million from its Thursday night showings, and reached a $20 million Friday total, making it the biggest opening day in September box office history. It went on to be the number one film during its opening weekend, taking $41 million at the box office. The film grossed a worldwide total of $161,919,318 against a budget of $5 million.\n\nReview aggregate Rotten Tomatoes sampled 111 reviews and judged 39% of the reviews to be positive. The site's consensus reads: \"\"Insidious: Chapter 2\" is decidedly short on the tension and surprises that made its predecessor so chilling.\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 40 out of 100 based on 30 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nRobbie Collin of \"The Telegraph\" gave the film a positive review, stating that \"the scares are mostly very scary indeed, and that means the film does its job.\" Scott Foundas of \"Variety\" praised the \"artfully eerie\" cinematography work of John R. Leonetti and the \"pervasively unsettling atmosphere\" constructed by sound designer and editor Joe Dzuban. Foundas further wrote that \"where so many sequels seem like mere remakes of their predecessors, with bigger budgets and less imagination, \"Insidious: Chapter 2\" feels like a genuine continuation of characters we enjoyed getting to know the first time around, and wouldn't at all mind returning to again.\" Conversely, Robert Abele of the \"Los Angeles Times\" commented, \"After the pleasurable free fall into old-fashioned nightmare artistry that was last summer's \"The Conjuring\", this busy-yet-dull sequel feels like Wan robotically flexing his manipulation of fright-film signposts, an exercise more silly than sinister.\" Justin Lowe of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote, \"Setting aside the movie's tediously lame dialogue, self-conscious performances and frequently predictable scares, the narrative's compulsively shifting chronology intermittently manages to engage, although it does little to obscure the distracting shortcomings of both plot and character development.\"\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on December 10, 2013.\n\nOn September 16, 2013, a third film in the series was announced with Leigh Whannell signed on to return as writer while Jason Blum and Oren Peli are also set to produce. When asked about returning for another sequel, actor Patrick Wilson went on to say that he \"[doesn't] know where else it could go\", and that \"[Josh Lambert has] been through the wringer, and I think the movie sets it up well at the end ... And that's great, that's how it should end.\" On March 11, 2014, it was reported that the third film wouldn't focus on the Lambert family, but would focus on a new family and story, that it wouldn't connect to the last teaser scene in the second film, and that Whannell and Sampson wouldn't return as ghost hunters Specs and Tucker. On May 7, 2014, Wan tweeted that Whannell would be directing the third film, which would mark his directorial debut. Stefanie Scott and Dermot Mulroney starred in the film. Focus Features and Stage 6 Films released the follow-up on June 5, 2015.\n\n\n"}

Called a \"circus legend\" by sources such as the BBC, Bugrimova was the first woman in Russia and the then-Soviet Union to work with lions, tigers, and ligers in a variety of performing acts, and trained more than 70 big cats during her career.\n\nIrina Nikolajewna Bugrimova was born in Kharkiv, Russian Empire (now Ukraine) on March 13, 1910. The daughter of a veterinarian and a ballet dancer, she excelled in athletics as a child, including as a champion speed skater. She eventually parlayed her talent into a career as a motorcyclist and gymnast at circuses, among other things.\n\nShe died in Moscow.\n\nIn 1929, Bugrimova transferred to the Moscow State Circus, and it was there she met the animal trainers Nikolaj Gladilstchikow and Boris Eder, who taught her the practice. She made her debut ten years later in 1939, and designed many of her own tricks, such as lions tightrope walking, acts involving motorcycles, and a giant swing which she would leap from with a cat. In one stunt, a lion would run in front of her motorcycle as if in fear, while another would jump onto the back of her seat to ride along. She flirted with danger by swinging on a giant swing with a lion. At the end of the routine the two jumped off the swing together and she fed the animal a piece of meat with her teeth. Her act ended with the lions laying down as she cavorted on a carpet of cats. Later she worked with the Circus Humberto in Czechoslovakia and the East German Circus. \n\nBugrimova performed in circuses well into her 60s, and was decorated several times by the Soviet state. Today there is also an avenue named in her honor in her hometown of Kharkiv, in front of the city's circus.\n\n"}

She explains that she regards the mutant gene as a 'corruption' of healthy tissue, and justifies her research by looking at mutants who committed suicide or hurt others because of their powers, such as a female mutant with a butterfly-like appearance or Tildie Soames (a child whose nightmares can manifest into monsters).\n\nHundreds of mutants immediately signed up for the procedure at Benetech (the corporate backer of her research). The X-Men debated the merits of the cure and the significance of labelling the mutant condition a disease. The chance at shedding his \"beastly\" appearance and avoiding any further secondary mutations held significant appeal for Hank McCoy (aka Beast) and he considered taking the serum for a time, although Wolverine objected by saying that an X-Man taking the serum would be the equivalent of admitting that there was something to 'cure' in the first place.\n\nIt was later revealed that Rao had been working for the alien Ord of the Breakworld, who also had in his custody Colossus (who was, at that time, thought to be dead, but had been resurrected by Ord's technology). The X-Men defeated Ord and Benetech, and Ord was delivered into the hands of S.H.I.E.L.D.. Dr. Rao's work was destroyed by Wolverine, leaving Hank with the last sample of \"Hope\", although he remains uncertain whether or not he will use it at some point.\n\nKavita Rao was pictured alongside several super-villains to whom Beast offers to 'sell his soul' for a means to un-do the effects of M-Day. With her old research into 'curing' the mutant gene now irrelevant after so many mutants lost their powers, she agrees to aid Beast in his quest and is now looking for more info that might help him.\n\nAfter Beast has finished gathering his science squad, they head back to base where he introduces them to their final member, Kavita Rao. Together they hold a meeting where he explains everything about how the Decimation occurred. When Beast proposes they go back in time to obtain the DNA sample of the parents of a mutant, Kavita questions why they must all go when Beast says it's one of the perks of the job. She travels back with the rest of the X-Club and Psylocke to the year 1906. There she helps look over Catherine Bradley after injuring herself during the Hellfire Club's assassination attempt. During the events of Utopia, she helps raise Asteroid M from the bottom of the ocean and attends the funeral of Dr. Yuriko Takiguchi when he passes away.\n\nIn the aftermath of Utopia, Karma and Magik are requested to see Kavita Rao to inform her of their foray into Legion's mind. When Kavita mistakes Marci, a young girl who was absorbed into Legion's mind, for one of his personalities, Karma corrects her and reveals that Marci was a real person but that Legion revealed Marci doesn't have a body to return to and explains how his powers work.\n\nWhen Cable and Hope Summers return to the present, Bastion begins to set his plan in motion in exterminating the mutant race. Thanks to the New Mutants, they discover he has erected towers in certain points around San Francisco. Cyclops sends the X-Club to investigate. Upon arriving on one of his oil platforms where one of these towers is located, they come across a timer which goes off. \n\nKavita's life flashes before her eyes and when the timer hits zero they end up transported to a dystopian future where they meet a now human Hank McCoy, who warns them to keep Kavita safe at all costs. Hank reveals that Hope Summers powers grew out of control and he needs Kavita to recreate her Hope serum to stop her from creating the future they see before them. After some convincing, Kavita reveals she kept an encrypted copy of the formula on her Mala bracelet and they go to Utopia to take out Hope.\n\nArriving on Utopia it is revealed that the dystopian future is a lie created by Graydon Creed using holographic hard-light technology. Kavita revealing she knew of the deception, didn't recreate the Hope serum but instead an unstable pyrovirus instead which causes the oil platform to explode. The X-Club get out in time only to see the dome envelope Utopia and the citizens of San Francisco. Later they work with the Avengers and Fantastic Four in trying to bring the dome down.\n\nFollowing the events of Second Coming, Kavita is seen with Doctor Nemesis checking on Jubilee after a vampire suicide bomber infects her with a virus manufactured to turn her into a vampire. While the rest of the X-Men meet to discuss the vampire problem, Kavita goes to check on Jubilee only to be knocked unconscious. The X-Science team, in a later attempt to fight the encroaching threat of vampirism, get locked down in the labs with a vampire and five people infected at the same time as Jubilee. With the assistance of the White Queen, the Science Team and some of the infectees survive. Madison kills the vampire. \n\nIn the \"Age of X\" reality, Kavita Rao is branded as a traitor to humanity for allying with the mutants, helping Wolverine eliminate an anti-mutant toxin.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48445080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48445080", "title": "Kingdom (video game)", "text": "Kingdom (video game)\n\nKingdom is a kingdom-building simulation game developed by Thomas van den Berg and Marco Bancale with support from publisher Raw Fury. The title was released on 21 October 2015 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux systems. A port for Xbox One was released on 8 August 2016, the ports for iOS and Android were released on 31 January 2017, and the ports for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 were released on 14 September 2017 and 16 January 2018 simultaneously. A reworked version of the game, titled \"Kingdom: New Lands\", was released in August 2016, and a sequel, \"Kingdom: Two Crowns\", is set to release in 2018.\n\nThe game is played out on a pixel art-based 2 dimensional landscape; the player controls a king or queen that rides back and forth, collecting coins and using those coins to spend on various resources, such as hiring soldiers and weaponsmiths, building defenses against creatures that can attack and steal the king or queen's crown which will end the game, and otherwise expanding their kingdom. The player has otherwise little direct control of the game, and thus must use the coins they collect in judicious ways.\n\n\"Kingdom\" received generally positive reviews appreciating the game's art and music, and its approach that required the players to figure out what to do based on these elements, but felt that the tedious nature of some tasks in the game affected its end-game and replayability.\n\n\"Kingdom\" is presented to the player in a pixel art, two-dimensional screen, with the goal to build up and create a kingdom while surviving various foes that will attempt to capture the player-character's crown, effectively ending their rule. The player starts the game with a randomly generated king or queen on horseback. The player can move the character on horse to the left or right, including at a gallop, but has no other direct action. As the character passes landmarks, these will produce a few coins, from which the player can pick up by riding over them, and spend on various resources, which will be marked with open coin slots when the character passes near them; to purchase an upgrade, the player must be able to provide all the required coins at that time.\n\nInitially, such resources will include hiring wandering travelers to become part of the kingdom and creating smiths to craft weapons and tools. As the player gathers more resources, new options to spend coins will open up. For example, once the player has a citizen of the kingdom with a tool, they can build defensive walls. Many such resources include upgrades that can be purchased with coins. To get more coins, the player roams their kingdom; additional landmarks will grant more coins, while servants in the kingdom can also generate coins.\n\nWhile exploration of the kingdom can lead to finding more coins and potential resources, the areas away from the main kingdom center can become more dangerous for both the player-character and any followers; further, the game has a day-and-night cycle in which more harmful creatures can roam the kingdom at night, with subsequent nights becoming more and more dangerous. Other nights may have blood moons, which will cause much larger hordes of creatures to appear. These creatures will work to destroy existing resources that the player has created, steal gold from the player-character, and if the player-character has no gold, steal their crown, which represents failure in the game from which the player will need to restart the game. The player is encouraged to manage the construction of defenses and guards to manage those defenses against the need to expand and improve the kingdom. There is an ultimate goal to achieve victory, though the player must come to determine that for themselves.\n\n\"Kingdom\" was developed by the two-man team of Thomas van den Berg and Marco Bancale, who go by the aliases noio and Licorice, respectively. The game is an expanded, standalone version of a Flash game by noio. The development of the game was supported by Raw Fury, a Sweden-based publisher launched by former members of Paradox Interactive and EA DICE.\n\nIn mid-2016, Raw Fury announced \"Kingdom: New Lands\", an expansion to the original game. New content will be added to the game that will address some of the repetitive aspects critics found on the game's original release, such as adding new lands to be explored and a seasonal climate system that affects gameplay. The expansion released on 9 August 2016, with owners of the original game able to update for free.\n\nWithin one day of its Windows, OS X, and Linux release, Raw Fury announced that it had sold enough copies to pay for the game's development. As a result, they affirmed that they will be releasing the title for the Xbox One, and that all future improvements and expansions to the game will remain free to players on the forementioned platforms. The team also later announced planned for a port to the Nintendo Switch. Mobile versions of the game, including the \"New Lands\" additions, for iOS and NVIDIA Shield devices were released circa March 2017.\n\n\"Kingdom\" has received generally favorable reviews. Dan Stapleton of \"IGN\" gave the title a 7.7 out of 10, and felt the lack of instruction combined with the tension of the various random attacks created a great experience for the game. Robert Purchase of \"Eurogamer\" gave the game a \"Recommended\" rating, believing the game achieved the right balance between being fair to the player while the player learns the mechanics of the game. James Davenport of \"PC Gamer\", giving the game a 70 out of 100, was more critical of the lack of instruction, noting that a half-hour's worth of gameplay investment could be wiped away due to the player not being aware of how certain mechanics work, and that the game would be one to test a player's patience. Reviewers praised the game's retro pixel art look and its chiptune soundtrack, which created the appropriate atmosphere for the title and provided appropriate visual and audible clues as events in the game for the player to pick up on.\n\nReviewers commented that once the player understood the mechanics, the end-game and subsequent replays could become tedious. Stapleton found that the lack of information or means to manage the kingdom at the end-game made the end game more frustrating than difficult, and that once he had found a strategy to deal with the attacks, the game became too easy to play. Davenport commented that while the late game can be exciting on subsequent playthroughs, the early game of setting up the initial kingdom can become monotonous.\n\n\"Kingdom\" was nominated for the Excellence in Design award for the 2016 Independent Games Festival.\n"}
{"id": "330264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=330264", "title": "Lamar Hunt", "text": "Lamar Hunt\n\nLamar Hunt (August 2, 1932 – December 13, 2006) was an American businessman notable for his promotion of American football, soccer, basketball, tennis and ice hockey in the United States and for his efforts in conjunction with his brothers, William Herbert Hunt and Nelson Bunker Hunt, to corner the silver market in the late 1970s and early 1980s. \n\nHe was the principal founder of the American Football League (AFL) and Major League Soccer (MLS), as well as MLS's predecessor, the North American Soccer League (NASL), and co-founder of World Championship Tennis. He was also the founder and owner of the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL), the Kansas City Wizards of MLS, and at the time of his death owned two other MLS teams, Columbus Crew and FC Dallas. In Kansas City, Hunt also helped establish the Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun theme parks.\n\nThe oldest ongoing national soccer tournament in the United States, the U.S. Open Cup (founded 1914), now bears his name in honor of his pioneering role in that sport stateside. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1972; into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1982; and into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1993. The National Soccer Hall of Fame bestowed upon Hunt their Medal of Honor in 1999, an award given to only three recipients in history thus far. He was married for 42 years to his second wife Norma, and had four children, Sharron, Lamar Jr., Daniel, and Clark Hunt.\n\nHunt was born in El Dorado, Arkansas, the son of oil tycoon H. L. Hunt and younger brother of tycoons Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt. Lamar was raised in Dallas, Texas. He attended Culver Military Academy and graduated from The Hill School in Pennsylvania in 1951 and Southern Methodist University in Dallas in 1956, with a B.S. degree in geology. Hunt was a college football player who rode the bench but was still an avid sports enthusiast during his time in college and throughout his entire childhood. While attending SMU in 1952, Hunt joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity. In 1972, he was selected as Kappa Sigma's Man of the Year.\n\nOn the strength of his great inherited oil wealth, Hunt applied for a National Football League expansion franchise but was turned down. In 1959, professional football was a distant second to Major League Baseball in popularity, and the thinking among NFL executives was that the league must be careful not to \"oversaturate\" the market by expanding too quickly. Hunt also attempted to purchase the NFL's Chicago Cardinals franchise in 1959 with the intent to move them to Dallas, but was again turned down.\n\nIn response, Hunt approached several other businessmen who had also unsuccessfully sought NFL franchises, including fellow Texan and oil man K. S. \"Bud\" Adams of Houston, about forming a new football league, and the American Football League was established in August 1959. The group of the eight founders of the AFL teams was referred to as the \"Foolish Club.\" Hunt's goal was to bring professional football to Texas and to acquire an NFL team for the Hunt family. Hunt became owner of the Dallas Texans and hired future hall-of-famer Hank Stram as the team's first head coach.\n\nAs a response to the newly formed league and the presence of an AFL franchise in Dallas, the NFL quickly placed a new franchise of their own in Dallas, the Dallas Cowboys. As a result, the Dallas Texans, despite being one of the more successful AFL teams in the league's early days, failed to draw fans in large numbers, as the Texans had to compete with the Dallas Cowboys for fans. In one popular, though probably apocryphal, story, a reporter informed Hunt's father that the Texans had lost $1 million in their first season. In response, H.L. Hunt supposedly said, \"At that rate, he can only last another 100 years.\" Lamar himself later said that the numbers mentioned in the story were \"overly flattering.\" In 1963 Hunt began to consider moving the team. Kansas City became one of the contending cities for the franchise. In order to convince Hunt to move the team to Kansas City, mayor H. Roe Bartle promised Hunt home attendance of 25,000 people per game. Hunt finally agreed to move the team to Kansas City, and in 1963 the Dallas Texans became the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nIn the Chiefs' first two seasons attendance did not match the levels Mayor Bartle had promised, but in 1966 average home attendance at Chiefs games increased and reached 37,000. By 1969 Chiefs' average home attendance had reached 51,000. In 1966 the Chiefs won their first AFL Championship (after having previously won it as the Dallas Texans) and reached the first ever Super Bowl, which the Chiefs lost to the Green Bay Packers. The Chiefs remained successful through the 1960s, and in 1970 the Chiefs won the AFL Championship and Super Bowl IV (the last Super Bowl played when the AFL was a separate league prior to it being absorbed into the NFL as the American Football Conference) over the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings.\n\nHunt insisted that he be listed in the team media guide as the \"founder\" of the Chiefs rather than the \"owner\". He publicly listed his telephone number in the phone book until his death.\n\nIn 1966, the NFL and AFL agreed to merge, with a championship game between the two leagues to be played after that season. In a July 25, 1966, letter to NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, Hunt wrote, \"I have kiddingly called it the 'Super Bowl,' which obviously can be improved upon.\" Hunt would later say the name was likely in his head because his children had been playing with a Super Ball toy. Although the leagues' owners decided on the name \"AFL-NFL Championship Game\", the media immediately picked up on Hunt's \"Super Bowl\" name, which would become official beginning with the third annual game, which was won by the AFL's New York Jets over the NFL's Baltimore Colts.\n\nIn 1967 Hunt helped promote professional soccer in the United States. Hunt's interest in soccer began in 1962 when he accompanied his future wife, Norma, to a Shamrock Rovers game in Dublin, Ireland. In 1966, he viewed the FIFA World Cup in England, and then attended nine of the next 11 World Cup tournaments.\n\nIn 1967, Hunt founded the Dallas Tornado as members of the United Soccer Association. In 1968 the league merged with the National Professional Soccer League to form the North American Soccer League. Hunt was an active advocate for the sport and the league and the Dallas Tornado won the NASL championship in 1971 and were runners-up 1973.\n\nThe NFL owners were not happy with Hunt's ownership in and promotion of pro soccer. The NFL attempted to force legal requirements that would disallow team ownership in more than one sport for owners of NFL franchises. This strategy backfired on the NFL, and the NASL won an anti-trust case against the NFL. A primary benefactor of this outcome was Lamar Hunt.\n\nIn 1981, after 15 seasons and losses in the millions, Hunt and his Dallas Tornado partner Bill McNutt decided to merge their team with the Tampa Bay Rowdies franchise, while retaining a minority stake in the Florida club. Two years later, along with Rowdies principal George Strawbrige, they sold the Rowdies to local investors. The move effectively ended Hunt's ties to the NASL a year before the league itself finally collapsed.\n\nHunt returned to soccer as one of the original founding investors of Major League Soccer, which debuted in 1996. He originally owned two teams: the Columbus Crew and the Kansas City Wizards (now Sporting Kansas City). In 1999, Hunt financed the construction of the venue now known as Mapfre Stadium, the second, and first since 1913, of several large soccer-specific stadiums in the USA. In 2003, Hunt purchased a third team, the Dallas Burn (now FC Dallas), after announcing that he would partially finance the construction of their own soccer-specific stadium. On 31 August 2006, Hunt sold the Wizards to a six-man ownership group led by Cerner Corporation co-founders Neal Patterson and Cliff Illig.\n\nHunt was one of the founding investors of the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association. He remained a minority owner until his death.\n\nIn 1968, Hunt co-founded the World Championship Tennis circuit, which gave birth to the Open Era of tennis. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\nHunt and John H. McConnell formed Columbus Hockey Limited, L.L.C. (CHL) in an effort to obtain a National Hockey League franchise for Columbus, Ohio. Following disagreements over the financing for an arena, McConnell accepted an offer to lease a new arena from Nationwide Insurance Enterprise. McConnell froze out CHL and Hunt and was awarded the NHL Columbus Blue Jackets franchise. See \"McConnell v. Hunt Sports Enterprises\", 132 Ohio App.3d 657, 725 N.E.2d 1193 (1999), a lawsuit that Lamar Hunt lost and thus granted McConnel sole ownership of the Columbus Blue Jackets.\n\nHunt was the founder of two theme parks in Kansas City: Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun, which opened in 1973 and 1982 respectively. The two parks were an outgrowth and adjoined a vast industrial park he developed in the bluffs above the Missouri River in Clay County, Missouri.\n\nImmediately south of the Hunt-founded parks is the Hunt-developed SubTropolis, a 55,000,000 square foot (5,060,000 m), manmade limestone cave which is claimed to be the \"World's Largest Underground Business Complex (TM).\" Hunt's extensive business dealings in Clay County were to contribute to the Chiefs having their NFL Training Camp at William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri until 1991.\n\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, Hunt and his brothers Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt attempted to corner the silver market. They began buying silver in the early 1970s. By the end of 1979 their ownership of one-third of the silver market caused the price to rise from $11 an ounce in September 1979 to $50 an ounce in January 1980. In the last nine months of 1979, the brothers profited by an estimated $2 billion to $4 billion. However, on March 27, 1980, subsequently referred to within the precious-metals industry as Silver Thursday, the price collapsed. In September 1988, the Hunt brothers filed for bankruptcy under United States Bankruptcy Code Chapter 11.\n\nLamar Hunt had two brothers, Nelson Bunker and William Herbert. He was married twice. His first marriage to Rosemary Carr, ended in a divorce. He had two children from his first marriage. He remarried later to Norma Lynn Knobel, who he was married to until his death. He had three sons, Clark, Lamar Jr., and Daniel, as well as one daughter, Sharron Hunt.\n\nLamar Hunt died December 13, 2006, at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas of complications related to prostate cancer. Upon his death, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones called Hunt \"a founder of the NFL as we know it today,\" adding \"He's been an inspiration for me.\" Said Dan Rooney, chairman of the Pittsburgh Steelers: \"Lamar Hunt was one of the most influential owners in professional football over the past 40-plus years, He was instrumental in the formation of the American Football League and in the AFL-NFL merger, which helped the National Football League grow into America's passion.\" The Mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, Kay Waldo Barnes, requested that all city flags fly at half-staff the following Thursday and Friday after Hunt's death.\n\nUpon Hunt's death, his son Clark was named chairman of the Kansas City Chiefs and FC Dallas, having been elected by Hunt's other children, Lamar Hunt Jr., Sharron Munson, and Daniel Hunt. Though Hunt's wife and children share legal ownership of the Chiefs, Clark represents the team at all league owner meetings and handles the day-to-day responsibilities of the team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24970695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24970695", "title": "List of biggest box-office bombs", "text": "List of biggest box-office bombs\n\nIn the film and media industry, if a film released in theatres fails to break even by a large amount, it is considered a box office bomb or box office flop, thus losing money for the distributor, studio, and/or production company that invested in it. Due to the secrecy surrounding costs and profit margins in the film industry, figures of losses are usually rough estimates at best, and there are often conflicting estimates over how much a film has lost. To accommodate this uncertainty the losses are presented as ranges where this is the case and the list is ordered alphabetically in the absence of a definitive order. Because the films on the list have been released over a large span of time currency inflation is also a factor that must be considered, so the losses are adjusted for inflation using the United States Consumer Price Index to enable a fair comparison.\n\nSome films on this list grossed more than their production budgets yet are still regarded as flops. This can be due to Hollywood accounting practices that typically manipulate profits or keep costs secret to avoid profit-sharing agreements, but it is also possible for films to lose money legitimately even when the theatrical gross exceeds the budget. This is because a distributor does not collect the full gross, and the full cost of a film can substantially exceed its production budget once distribution and marketing is taken into account. For example, tax filings in 2010 for Cinemark Theatres show that only 54.5 percent of ticket revenues went to the distributor, with the exhibitor retaining the rest. While the distributor's cut will vary from film to film, a Hollywood studio will typically collect half the gross in the United States and less in other parts of the world. Marketing often represents a substantial share of the overall cost of the picture too: for a film with an average sized budget the promotion and advertising costs are typically half that of the production budget, and in the case of smaller films it is not unusual for the cost of the marketing to be higher than the production budget. In some cases, a company can make profits from a box office bomb when ancillary revenues are taken into account, such as home media sales and rentals, television broadcast rights, and licensing fees, so a film that loses money at the box office can still eventually break even.\n\nThe following list is limited to films that are potentially among the top one hundred box office losses, adjusted for inflation (approximately upper-bound losses of $70 million or higher).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "74909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74909", "title": "Masque", "text": "Masque\n\nThe masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully.\n\nThe masque tradition developed from the elaborate pageants and courtly shows of ducal Burgundy in the late Middle Ages. Masques were typically a complimentary offering to the prince among his guests and might combine pastoral settings, mythological fable, and the dramatic elements of ethical debate. There would invariably be some political and social application of the allegory. Such pageants often celebrated a birth, marriage, change of ruler or a Royal Entry and invariably ended with a tableau of bliss and concord. Masque imagery tended to be drawn from Classical rather than Christian sources, and the artifice was part of the Grand dance. Masque thus lent itself to Mannerist treatment in the hands of master designers like Giulio Romano or Inigo Jones. The New Historians, in works like the essays of Bevington and Holbrook's \"The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque\" (1998), have pointed out the political subtext of masques. At times, the political subtext was not far to seek: \"The Triumph of Peace\", put on with a large amount of parliament-raised money by Charles I, caused great offence to the Puritans. Catherine de' Medici's court festivals, often even more overtly political, were among the most spectacular entertainments of her day, although the \"intermezzi\" of the Medici court in Florence could rival them.\n\nIn English theatre tradition, a dumbshow is a masque-like interlude of silent mime usually with allegorical content that refers to the occasion of a play or its theme, the most famous being the dumbshow played out in \"Hamlet\" (III.ii). Dumbshows might be a moving spectacle, like a procession, as in Thomas Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\" (1580s), or they might form a pictorial tableau, as one in the Shakespeare collaboration, \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\" (III.i)—a tableau that is immediately explicated at some length by the poet-narrator, Gower. Dumbshows were a Medieval element that continued to be popular in early Elizabethan drama, but by the time \"Pericles\" (c. 1607–08) or \"Hamlet\" (c. 1600–02) were staged, they were perhaps quaintly old-fashioned: “What means this, my lord?” is Ophelia's reaction. In English masques, purely musical interludes might be accompanied by a dumbshow.\n\nThe masque has its origins in a folk tradition where masked players would unexpectedly call on a nobleman in his hall, dancing and bringing gifts on certain nights of the year, or celebrating dynastic occasions. The rustic presentation of \"Pyramus and Thisbe\" as a wedding entertainment in Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" offers a familiar example. Spectators were invited to join in the dancing. At the end, the players would take off their masks to reveal their identities.\n\nIn England, Tudor court masques developed from earlier \"guisings\", where a masked allegorical figure would appear and address the assembled company—providing a theme for the occasion—with musical accompaniment; masques at Elizabeth's court emphasized the concord and unity between Queen and Kingdom. A descriptive narrative of a processional masque is the masque of the Seven Deadly Sins in Edmund Spenser's \"The Faerie Queene\" (Book i, Canto IV). A particularly elaborate masque, performed over the course of two weeks for Queen Elizabeth, is described in the 1821 novel \"Kenilworth\", by Sir Walter Scott. Later, in the court of James I, narrative elements of the masque became more significant. Plots were often on classical or allegorical themes, glorifying the royal or noble sponsor. At the end, the audience would join with the actors in a final dance. Ben Jonson wrote a number of masques with stage design by Inigo Jones. Their works are usually thought of as the most significant in the form. Sir Philip Sidney also wrote masques.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare wrote a masque-like interlude in \"The Tempest,\" understood by modern scholars to have been heavily influenced by the masque texts of Ben Jonson and the stagecraft of Inigo Jones. There is also a masque sequence in his \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Henry VIII\". John Milton's \"Comus\" (with music by Henry Lawes) is described as a masque, though it is generally reckoned a pastoral play.\n\nReconstructions of Stuart masques have been few and far between. Part of the problem is that only texts survive complete; there is no complete music, only fragments, so no authoritative performance can be made without interpretive invention. \n\nThere is a detailed, humorous and malicious account by Sir John Harington of a 1606 masque of Solomon and Sheba: however he was not so much concerned with the masque itself as with the notoriously heavy drinking at the Court of King James I; \" the entertainment went forward, and most of the presenters went backward, or fell down, wine did so occupy their upper chambers\". As far as we can ascertain the details of the masque, the Queen of Sheba was to bring gifts to the King, representing Solomon, and was to be followed by the spirits of Faith, Hope, Charity, Victory and Peace. Unfortunately, as Harington gleefully reported, the actress playing the Queen tripped over the steps of the throne, sending her gifts flying; Hope and Faith were too drunk to speak a word, while Peace, annoyed at finding her way to the throne blocked, made good use of her symbolic olive branches to slap anyone who was in her way.\n\nBy the time of the English Restoration (1660), the masque was passé, but the English semi-opera which developed in the latter part of the 17th century, a form in which John Dryden and Henry Purcell collaborated, borrows some elements from the masque and further elements from the contemporary courtly French opera of Jean-Baptiste Lully.\n\nin the 18th-century, masques were even less frequently staged. \"Rule, Britannia!\" started out as part of \"Alfred\", a masque about Alfred the Great co-written by James Thomson and David Mallet with music by Thomas Arne which was first performed at Cliveden, country house of Frederick, Prince of Wales. Performed to celebrate the third birthday of Frederick's daughter Augusta, it remains among the best-known British patriotic songs up to the present, while the masque of which it was originally part is only remembered by specialist historians.\n\nThe most outstanding humanists, poets and artists of the day, in the full intensity of their creative powers, devoted themselves to producing masques; and until the Puritans closed the English theatres in 1642, the masque was the highest artform in England. But because of its ephemeral nature, not a lot of documentation related to masques remains, and much of what is said about the production and enjoyment of masques is still part speculation.\n\nWhile the masque was no longer as popular as it was at its height in the 17th Century, there are many later examples of the masque. During the late 17th century, English semi-operas by composers such as Henry Purcell had masque scenes inset between the acts of the play proper. In the 18th century, William Boyce and Thomas Arne, among other composers, continued to utilize the masque genre mostly as an occasional piece, and the genre became increasingly associated with patriotic topics. There are isolated examples throughout the first half of the 19th century.\n\nWith the renaissance of English musical composition during the late 19th and early 20th century (the so-called English Musical Renaissance), English composers turned to the masque as a way of connecting to a genuinely English musical-dramatic form in their attempts to build a historically-informed national musical style for England. Examples include those by Arthur Sullivan, George Macfarren, and even Edward Elgar, whose imperialistic \"Crown of India\" was the central feature at the London Coliseum in 1912. Masques also became common as scenes in operettas and musical theatre works set during the Elizabethan period.\n\nIn the 20th century, Ralph Vaughan Williams wrote several masques, including his masterpiece in the genre, \"Job, a masque for dancing\" which premiered in 1930, although the work is closer to a ballet than a masque as it was originally understood. His designating it a masque was to indicate that the modern choreography typical when he wrote the piece would not be suitable.\n\nConstant Lambert also wrote a piece he called a masque, \"Summer's Last Will and Testament\", for orchestra, chorus and baritone. His title he took from Thomas Nash, whose masque was probably first presented before the Archbishop of Canterbury, perhaps at his London seat, Lambeth Palace, in 1592.\n\n"}

The question of bias in South Asian media is also of great interest to people living outside of South Asia. Some accusations of media bias are motivated by a disinterested desire for truth, some are politically motivated. Media bias occurs in television, newspapers, school books and other media.\n\nIn British India, bias in the media coverage of the Bengal famine of 1943 has been highlighted by historians. Calcutta's two leading English-language newspapers were \"The Statesman\" (at that time a British-owned newspaper) and \"Amrita Bazar Patrika\". In the early months of the famine, the government applied pressure on newspapers to \"calm public fears about the food supply\" and follow the official stance that there was no rice shortage. This effort had some success; \"The Statesman\" published editorials asserting that the famine was due solely to speculation and hoarding, while \"berating local traders and producers, and praising ministerial efforts.\" News of the famine was also subject to strict war-time censorship – even use of the word \"famine\" was prohibited – leading \"The Statesman\" later to remark that the UK government \"seems virtually to have withheld from the British public knowledge that there was famine in Bengal at all\".\n\nArun Shourie and others have criticized \"biased Marxist influences\" in the media, as well as alleged corruption of Marxist historians, particularly during the time when they controlled the ICHR. These claims include the allegation that the history of the Islamic invasion has been whitewashed and censored in Indian school-books and in other media.\n\nReporters Without Borders said that India is at 133rd of 180 countries in the 2016 World Press Freedom Index, due to the number of journalists killed and the impunity for crimes of violence committed against journalists. Many media stations in India provided vast coverage of the Gujarat Riots in 2002 in which a large number of Muslims were murdered but have often failed to report on the persecution of Hindus in Muslim-dominated Jammu & Kashmir. There are also denials of the fact that Indians in general and Hindus in particular are being ethnically cleansed in Kashmir. With regard to the 2002 Gujarat violence, some commentators have pointed out a disregard for factual reporting on the part of what they term \"left-liberal\" newspapers.\n\nDuring the Radia tapes controversy there was an attempted blackout orchestrated by many prominent Indian TV channels and newspapers, however, the news gained prominence following sustained pressure on social networking sites Twitter and Facebook According to the \"Washington Post\", \"Twitter has played an important role in launching what has become an international conversation on the issue, with the Indian diaspora weighing in\". Initially, only a handful of the mainstream newspapers in India, like The \"Deccan Herald\", Indian Express had openly written about the tapes. Some newspapers like \"HT Media\", \"Mint\" (the business newspaper also owned by HT media) and NDTV said \"the authenticity of these transcripts cannot be ascertained\". CNN-IBN's Sagarika Ghose discussed with a panel of experts, if the corporate lobbying is undermining democracy, on the \"Face the Nation\" programme on the channel. The Radia tapes is seen to have also made a dent in the image of the media in the country. \"The complete blackout of the Nira Radia tapes by the entire broadcast media and most of the major English newspapers paints a truer picture of corruption in the country,\" wrote G Sampath, the deputy editor of the \"Daily News and Analysis\" (DNA) newspaper. After it became an international news, more and more media houses covered the story. The Deccan Chronicle commented, \"The 'Radia tapes' may have torn the veil off the nexus between information hungry journalists, lobbyists and industrialists, and opened everyone’s eyes to what has long been suspected — the ability of a small but powerful group to use their connections to influence policy.\" The largest circulated English newspaper in India and the world, \"The Times of India\" finally opened up on 25 November 2010, commenting \"The people are showing who the boss is. The weapon in their hands is the internet, ... has seen frantic activism against \"power brokering\" by journalists in collusion with corporate groups and top government politicians...\" \"OPEN\" and \"Outlook\" reported that journalists Barkha Dutt (editor of NDTV) and Vir Sanghvi (editorial director of the \"Hindustan Times\") knew that corporate lobbyist Nira Radia influenced Raja's appointment as telecom minister, publicising Radia's phone conversations with Dutt and Sanghvi when Radia's phone was tapped by the Income Tax Department. According to critics, Dutt and Sanghvi knew about the link between the government and the media industry but delayed reporting the corruption.\n\n\"Paid news\" is a phenomenon which has recently come to light, involving politicians paying newspapers to print favorable articles. Some groups have criticized paid news including Bloomberg, who claimed that \"\"paid news\" was rotting India's democracy.\" The \"Analytic Monthly Review\" has also criticized India's media problems to well known problems in the political economy after the adoption of neo-liberal policies. In 2010, a two person panel of the Press Council of India investigated the phenomenon of paid news in India. This resulted in a detailed 72 page report citing names and instances where information that had been paid for had been passed off as genuine news. However, the Press council rejected their findings and published a shorter watered down version of the report.\n\nThere are serious demographic issues regarding the minority non-Islam population in Pakistan. The Christian, Hindu, and Sikh populations have gone from 23% to 2% in the period 1947-1997. International rights groups, like the Center for Indian Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, call this ethnic cleansing and accuse the media of not informing the public about these issues.\n\nThere are also allegations by Amnesty International that the local media some times glosses over reports of persecution against the non-Islamic population in Pakistan.\n\nUsing oppressive laws the government has also banned or officially silenced popular television channels. The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) has been used to silence the broadcast media by either suspending licenses or by simply threatening to do so. In many cases these channels were shifted to obscure numbers in channel line-up. In addition, media is also exposed to propaganda from state agencies, pressured by powerful political elements and non-state actors involved in the current conflict. A number of channels have been shut down in the past with the latest such incident involving Geo TV and other channels in the Geo TV network after a Fatwa was issued against it. The shutdown came after the network attempted to air allegations on the involvement of Inter-Services Intelligence in the attempted assassination of its leading anchor Hamid Mir.\n\nThe press is also restricted in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), where independent radio is allowed only with permission from the government.\n\nA prevalent culture of self- and state-censorship in the media’s coverage of sensitive issues has also been criticized, particularly in matters related to religion, blasphemy laws, and the Pakistan Army.\n\nThe urban bias in Pakistani media has been criticized by Amir Rana, director of the Institute for Peace Studies: “There is little space [in our media] not only for alternative ideas or narratives but also for issues of a common citizen ... The narratives that we have seen in the mainstream media in Pakistan are basically controlled by three media centers in Pakistan: Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore. There is little space in the mainstream media for views, perspectives, and information from other parts of Pakistan.” \n\nThe government of Sri Lanka has been accused of controlling the media. Measures like the Public Security Ordinance and the Sixth Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution have been accused of limiting a reporters freedom.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment to Sri Lanka's constitution, inserted as Article 157A, has been accused of threatening civic disability and seizing of property by banning promotion of separatism. The Public Security Ordinance (PSO) law is often applied liberally when the government applies emergency regulations. This is quite often as Sri Lanka has been ruled under Emergency for a cumulative total of over 20 years since it gained independence from the British. The Saturday Review, the English paper published in Jaffna and the Aththa, the Communist Sinhala language daily were banned in the early eighties under the PSO. When the Aththa was banned its press was also sealed. In the seventies, the government sealed the printing press of the Independent Newspapers Ltd. (Davasa Group) by using the emergency regulations.\n\nUnder the Emergency Regulations (E.R), all material relating to a subject specified in a gazetted presidential proclamation, has to be submitted for censoring by a 'competent authority.' The 'competent authority' is usually politically favoured civil servant. Recently, the regime made history by appointing a military officer as the government censor. Material censored under such provisions has included comment on the high cost of living, on the dismissal of an employee of a state corporation, allegedly for an article he wrote for his trade union journal, on the marketing problems of passion fruit growers, criticism of a minister's statement in Parliament about a public corporation, and a reference to an alleged assault on two civilians.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5895726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5895726", "title": "Musique mesurée", "text": "Musique mesurée\n\nMusique mesurée à l'antique () was a style of vocal musical composition in France in the late 16th century. In \"musique mesurée\", longer syllables in the French language were set to longer note values, and shorter syllables to shorter, in a homophonic texture but in a situation of metric fluidity, in an attempt to imitate contemporary understanding of Ancient Greek music. Although this compositional method did not attain popularity at first, it attracted some of the most famous composers of the time. Its basis in a desire to re-create the artistic ethos of Ancient Greece, especially in respect to text declamation, had a strong similarity to contemporary movements in Italy, such as the work of the Florentine Camerata which engendered the first operas, and brought about the beginning of the Baroque era in music.\n\nPieces written as \"musique mesurée\" were settings of the poetical form known as \"vers mesurés\". Beginning in the late 1560s in Paris, under the direction of Jean-Antoine de Baïf, a group of poets known as the Pléiade attempted to recreate the metrical effect of ancient Greek and Latin poetry in French, using the quantitative principles of those languages. The attempt was more than an academic one: Baïf and his associates, horrified by the barbarity of the age, including the bloody religious wars which raged throughout the last decades of the century, sought to improve mankind by bringing back the ancient diction, which was believed to have had a positive ethical effect on its hearers. For this attempt they had the approval of the current king of France, Charles IX, and they met in secret to plan their musical revolution. Baïf, with the royal patent, founded the \"Académie de Poésie et de Musique\" in 1570, along with his intimate musical associate Joachim Thibault de Courville. Poet Pierre de Ronsard was also involved in the group.\n\nAs originally planned, the members of the \"Académie\" would be in a hierarchy of two grades: first, the composers and singers, known as the \"professionnels\", and after that, the gentleman listeners, known as the \"auditeurs\", who were also to provide financial backing for the enterprise. Aside from this small group of aristocrats, no one else was invited. The concerts took place at Baïf's house in Paris: Charles IX himself, who provided much of the patronage, was often present.\n\nSome of the house rules have been recorded. There was to be no talking, or disturbances of any kind, during the singing, and anyone who came in late had to wait until the end of a piece to be seated – rather like modern concert-hall etiquette. Musicians were to rehearse every day, and no music was to be copied or taken away from the area of performance. The music was so closely guarded, at least during the early years of the \"Académie\", that no music of the originating composer – Courville – is known to have survived.\n\nThe \"Académie\" was short-lived, and probably did not survive after 1573, the year of the death of Charles IX. Another similar group, the \"Académie du Palais\", which met at the Louvre after 1573 with the backing of the new king, Henri III, seemed to carry on some of the work of the previous group, but its aim seems to have been more to debate philosophical issues than to reform humanity through reviving Ancient Greek and Latin poetry and music. The activities, if any, of the original Académie after this time are poorly-documented: while the musicians continued to meet, it is not known if they met in a formal setting, as they had prior to the death of Charles IX. This was during a period of increasing religious turmoil, ending in the fighting in Paris in 1589, and the assassination of the king; associations of humanists such as the \"Académie\", which included both Catholics and Protestants, became increasingly difficult (Baïf, a Catholic, even wrote a sonnet in 1572 praising the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre; Claude Le Jeune, a Protestant, was nearly murdered during the siege of Paris in 1589).\n\nEven though the original \"Académie\" had faded away within a few years of its founding, several prominent composers found the concept of \"musique mesurée\" to be so attractive as to make it their primary compositional method. The most famous of these was Claude Le Jeune, followed by Jacques Mauduit, Eustache Du Caurroy, Nicolas de la Grotte, and Guillaume Costeley.\n\nWhen \"musique mesurée\" first appeared, it was used mainly in French secular songs known as chansons. Most of the chansons written in the style were for five voices, unaccompanied, although instruments began to be used as accompaniment before long. Typically they consisted of a strophe and a refrain; the refrain would have the same music each time it recurred. As composers realized the adaptability of the musical style to other forms, they began to employ it elsewhere, for example in sacred music, such as psalm settings.\n\nThe texture of the music was almost uniformly homophonic, with all the voices singing essentially the same rhythm. The repeating pattern of longs and shorts, following the poetry, was irregular, leading to the perception to a modern ear of irregular meters. Occasional short melismas – decorative passages to ease the monotonous rhythm – appeared in many of the parts, especially in the work of Claude Le Jeune.\n\nLong and short syllables were invariably set in a 2:1 relation, for example quarter-notes on the longs and eighth-notes on the shorts. This was in order to mirror long and short syllables used in classical poetry, which in contemporary poetry would be stress accents. In modern notation, the meters would be irregular; often music in the \"musique mesurée\" is left unbarred in modern transcription, or given bar lines only at the end of phrases.\n\nIn addition to their use of ancient metres, composers of \"musique mesurée\" also used later interpretations of classical musical modes in order to move the emotions of their listeners, as it was described in ancient Greek sources.\n\nWhile \"musique mesurée\" was created and sung by a small group of people for a limited audience, and for the most part in secret, it was to have a profound effect on French music for the next hundred years. The \"air de cour\", the secular style of song which dominated the musical scene in France beginning in the 1580s, used the principles of \"musique mesurée\" with the difference that it usually used rhyming verse. In addition, even in the late 17th century, the influence of \"musique mesurée\" can be seen in the style of French recitative, both in opera and in sacred music.\n\nComposers that continued using the methods of \"musique mesurée\" into the 17th century included Jacques Mauduit, who used it for creating large works for mixed vocal and instrumental forces, roughly in the Venetian style, and Eustache Du Caurroy, who used the method for psalm settings. Marin Mersenne, in his \"Harmonie universelle\" of 1636-7, praised Du Caurroy as the finest practitioner of the style.\n\n\n"}

The reward most often comes in the form of tickets, with more tickets being awarded for higher scores. These tickets can then be redeemed (hence the name) at a central location for prizes. The most inexpensive prizes (candy, small plastic or rubber toys) may only require a small number of tickets to acquire, while the most expensive ones (skateboards, low end electronics) may require several thousand. In general, the amount of money spent to win enough tickets for a given prize will exceed the value of the prize itself.\n\nSome redemption games, particularly electronic ones such as Flamin' Finger, involve elements of chance, which can be set by the operator.\n\nA variation on the ticket-based redemption game is the merchandiser, which directly displays and dispenses merchandise, rather than dispensing tickets which are then redeemed for prizes.\nRedemption games can be seen as the modern successor to carnival games, as the same general principles apply.\n"}
{"id": "39246927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39246927", "title": "Orator (Cicero)", "text": "Orator (Cicero)\n\nOrator was written by Marcus Tullius Cicero in the latter part of the year 46 B.C. It is his last work on rhetoric, three years before his death. Describing rhetoric, Cicero addresses previous comments on the five canons of rhetoric: Inventio, Dispositio, Elocutio, Memoria, and Pronuntiatio. In this text, Cicero attempts to describe the perfect orator, in response to Marcus Junius Brutus’ request. \"Orator\" is the continuation of a debate between Brutus and Cicero, which originated in his text \"Brutus\", written earlier in the same year. \n\nThe oldest partial text of \"Orator\" was recovered in the monastery of Mont Saint-Michel and now is located in the library at Avranches. Thirty-seven existing manuscripts have been discovered from this text. Another complete text was discovered in 1421, near Milan in the town of Lodi. These two texts vary considerably between the two manuscripts and modern translators rely on both. \n\nIn 46. B.C, when Cicero wrote \"Orator\", many young Roman men revolted against the stylistic paradigms put forward by Cicero, and from most Roman traditions in general. Cicero writes in a defensive posture to this hostile audience.\n\nIn \"Orator\", Cicero depicts several models for speakers. Cicero states to the Romans the importance of searching and discovering their own sense of rhetoric. “I am sure, the magnificence of Plato did not deter Aristotle from writing, nor did Aristotle with all his marvelous breadth of knowledge put an end to the studies of others” Cicero encouraged the plebeians through his writing, “Moreover, not only were outstanding men not deterred from undertaking liberal pursuits, but even craftsmen did not give up their arts because they were unable to equal the beauty of the picture of Ialysus . . . .” Cicero proposes that rhetoric cannot be confined to one specific group but rather outlines a guide that will lead to the creation of successful orators across Roman society.\n\nIn \"Orator\", Cicero also addressed the accusation lodged by his fellow senators, including Brutus, that he was an “Atticist.” Cicero addresses this claim by saying that he is too independent and bold to be associated with Atticism, producing his own unique style. Cicero claims the perfect orator creates his own “elocutio,” or diction and style, rather than following this movement.\n\nThe three aims of the orator, according to Cicero, are \"\"docere, delectare, et movere\".\" That is: to prove your thesis to the audience, to delight the audience, and to emotionally move the audience. The emotional vividness of poetic language becomes part of the rhetorical tools in service of persuading the audience to your point of view.\n\n"}

In the broadest sense, main characteristics of partisan films are that they are set in Yugoslavia during World War II and have Yugoslav Partisans as main protagonists, while antagonists are Axis forces and their collaborators.\n\nThere are disagreements, even among the film critics, about the exact definition of the genre. Partisan films are often equated solely with the populist, entertainment-oriented branch of the genre, characterized by epic scope, ensemble casts, expensive production, and emotionally intense scenes, all introduced into Yugoslav war films by Veljko Bulajić's \"Kozara\" (1962). The other branchmuch less interesting to the Communist establishmentwas represented by modernist films, ranging from the poetic naturalism of the Yugoslav Black Wave to experimental stream-of-consciousness films.\n\nBy the 1980s, economic hardship in the country, as well as change in the ideological landscape, particularly with the younger Yugoslav generation, caused a waning of interest in the genre, and the critical and commercial failure of Bulajić's \"Great Transport\" (1983) is usually seen as a symbolic end of the partisan film era.\n\nIn his analysis of Fadil Hadžić's \"The Raid on Drvar\" (1963), Croatian film critic Jurica Pavičić identifies seven key characteristics of what he calls \"super-Partisan films\":\nPavičić's analysis was criticized for not being universally applicable to Partisan films, and a number of notable exceptions to the above formula were provided.\n\n\n\n\n"}

All seven chapters were released on March 28, 2017. The podcast was downloaded a record-breaking 10 million times in four days, and it had been downloaded over 40 million times by May of 2017.\n\nIn 2012, antiquarian horologist John B. McLemore sent an email to the staff of the show \"This American Life\" asking them to investigate an alleged murder in his hometown of Woodstock, Alabama, a place McLemore claimed to despise. After a year of exchanging emails, and several months of conversation with McLemore, producer Brian Reed traveled to Woodstock to investigate.\n\nReed investigated the crime, and eventually found that no such murder took place, though he struck up a friendship with the depressed but colorful character of McLemore. He recorded conversations with McLemore and other people in Woodstock, which are played on the podcast.\n\nMcLemore killed himself by drinking potassium cyanide on June 22, 2015, while the podcast was still in production. In the narrative of the podcast, this occurs at the end of the second episode; subsequent episodes deal with the fallout from McLemore's death while exploring more of McLemore's life and character.\n\n\nThough the podcast was promoted under the name \"S-Town\", Reed reveals in the first episode that this is a euphemism for \"Shittown,\" John B. McLemore's derogatory term for his hometown of Woodstock, Alabama. Reed generally refers to the podcast by the non-euphemized name in the episodes themselves.\n\nAll episodes were released simultaneously on March 28, 2017. The podcast is available to stream or download for free on the official website, iTunes, Stitcher, Radiopublic, or through the RSS feed.\n\n\"S-Town\" incorporates various specially composed pieces of music throughout the episodes from composers Daniel Hart, Helado Negro, Trey Pollard, and Matt McGinley, including an \"S-Town\" theme produced by Hart. The show's closing music, used at the end of each episode, is \"A Rose for Emily\" by The Zombies.\n\nShortly after the release of the podcast, John's online obituary was flooded with support and shared reflections from around the world. In an April 2017 interview, Tyler Goodson said that he sometimes regrets \"ever speaking into that microphone because [he] was probably upset, or wasn't thinking clearly\" since he faced trial for the criminal actions that were described in the podcast. In October 2017, Goodson pleaded guilty to the burglaries that were described in the podcast, and he will serve five years on probation with a ten-year suspended sentence.\n\n\"S-Town\" was culturally popular and received mixed critical reviews. \"The Boston Globe\" Ty Burr thought the show was complex and voyeuristic. He asked the question \"is \"S-Town\" a freak show for the NPR crowd?\" and described the series as \"seven chapters of provocative red herrings that almost but never quite add up to a place, a people, or a man\". Jessica Goudeau from \"The Atlantic\" questioned the ethics of the series, asking \"is it okay to confess another person's pain for the sake of a good story?\". Goudeau also wondered how Flannery O'Connor, Robert Lowell, or Elizabeth Bishop would have reacted to the podcast and the exploration of poor, white, rural America. \"Slate\" Katy Waldman wrote that \"S-Town\" feels more like a new genre, \"something more like aural literature\". \"Vox\"'s Aja Romano called the podcast \"stunning\", but suggested the podcast was too invasive and should not have been made.\n\nThe podcast's critics claimed that the studio took advantage of John's death in order to gain publicity. \"Crixeo\", an online arts monthly, argues that Reed did not have the right to publicly out John as queer. At the same time, other views contend that \"S-Town\" was a way for them to take the story of John's death and shed light on mental health in the U.S. \"The Atlantic\"'s Spencer Kornhaber praised the series for its journalism, and humanism, as the series \"hints at the possibility of cultural reconciliation\" within the community. Rebecca Nicholson from \"The Guardian\" called the series \"a noble attempt at understanding life\", as the series showed \"the great hope that resides within\", by showing a person trying to survive within their surroundings.\n\n\"The Guardian\" gave \"S-Town\" a critical review. The opinion piece called S-town “a good story, but an indefensible one.” The article states that the podcast is supposed to leave you feeling positive, however instead it feels forced. The author feels that the podcast doesn’t fully addressed the main quandary at the center of S-town.\n\nBy May 2017, the podcast series was downloaded over 40 million times. \nIt retained a high ranking in the iTunes chart and continued to be analysed in the press well into 2017. Since then, the podcast remained popular and had been downloaded 77 million times by the anniversary of its release.\n\nS-Town podcast received the Peabody Award for 2017 in the category Radio/Podcast.\n\nGeorge Foster Peabody Award\n\n"}
{"id": "38877093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38877093", "title": "Seokjeon", "text": "Seokjeon\n\nSeokjeon (\"stone battle\") was an ancient Korean ritual game or pastime. Originating as a form of martial training, \"seokjeon\" involved two teams of combatants throwing stones at one another. Over time, it developed into a formalised game.\n\nAlthough similar pastimes to \"seokjeon\" probably date back to the Iron Age, the first known record of the stone battle game (in the \"Sui Shu\") describes it being played by the subjects of Goguryeo in the sixth century C.E. The king of Goguryeo was present at these contests, in which participants throw stones and shouted in an attempt to drive the opposing team into the Daedong River.\n\nBy the time of the Joseon period, the stone battle game had become more formulaic, and had spread to the general population. Players would gather into two lines and strike one another with light clubs or tiles. The activity was still popular with royalty; King U of Goryeo is recorded as being an aficionado of the game.\n\nDespite this development, the stone battle game retained strong ties to the military. Sejong the Great sponsored stone battles between military units, and volunteers for these events were granted numerous perks and privileges - it was even possible for commoners who signed up for such games to gain government posts as a result. Whilst still somewhat formalised, these fights were nevertheless a form of military training, as evidenced by the fact that Sejong deployed his stone battle teams against barbarian incursions in the north of Goryeo.\n\nAs a result of royal patronage and military appropriation, the stone battle game became increasingly popular in the capital Seoul, where it was a common pastime during the festival of \"Dano\". The high rate of injury caused the city's Correctional Tribunal to ban the game for a time, but it was still played in rural areas outside the city. A minor scandal was caused when three royal princes staged such an illicit stone battle in 1438, which led to numerous injuries and several deaths; as a result, King Sejong was obliged to banish them and tighten the ban on stone-fighting.\n\nThe prohibition was not lifted until 1469, by which time stone battles had again become a popular civilian game rather than a military training exercise. It was often played between neighbouring villages. Large crowds of spectators would gather for these events, which could last for hours or even days. In some areas the game was used as a tool for divination, with the outcome supposedly indicating how successful the year's harvest would be.\n\nStone battles could be enormous affairs, lasting for several days and involving large gangs of players. The cities of Gimhae, Seoul and Pyongyang staged particularly impressive stone battles, usually during the \"Damo\" festivities. Such events often came close to civil unrest, with \"seokjeon\" players in Pyeong-yang targeting the \"yangban\" who owned the land, stoning their houses and holdings. However, the stone-throwers were not always on the wrong side of the rioting; there are reports that the Japanese Riots In Three Ports of 1510 were quelled largely as a result of the skilled stone battle players who faced the Japanese.\n\nThe Japanese eventually suppressed the game during the early part of the twentieth century, blaming it for causing social instability. As a result, it has largely died out in modern Korea.\n"}

{"id": "33629639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33629639", "title": "Stop Online Piracy Act", "text": "Stop Online Piracy Act\n\nThe Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) was a controversial United States bill introduced by U.S. Representative Lamar S. Smith (R-TX) to expand the ability of U.S. law enforcement to combat online copyright infringement and online trafficking in counterfeit goods. Provisions included the requesting of court orders to bar advertising networks and payment facilities from conducting business with infringing websites, and web search engines from linking to the websites, and court orders requiring Internet service providers to block access to the websites. The proposed law would have expanded existing criminal laws to include unauthorized streaming of copyrighted content, imposing a maximum penalty of five years in prison.\n\nProponents of the legislation said it would protect the intellectual-property market and corresponding industry, jobs and revenue, and was necessary to bolster enforcement of copyright laws, especially against foreign-owned and operated websites. Claiming flaws in existing laws that do not cover foreign-owned and operated websites, and citing examples of active promotion of rogue websites by U.S. search engines, proponents asserted that stronger enforcement tools were needed. The bill received strong, bipartisan support in the House of Representatives and the Senate. It also received support from the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Governors Association, The National Conference of Legislatures, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Attorneys General, the Chamber of Commerce, the Better Business Bureau, the AFL–CIO and 22 trade unions, the National Consumers League, and over a hundred associations representing industries throughout the economy which claim that they are being harmed by online piracy. Opponents argued that the proposed legislation threatened free speech and innovation, and enabled law enforcement to block access to entire Internet domains due to infringing content posted on a single blog or webpage. They also stated that SOPA would bypass the \"safe harbor\" protections from liability presently afforded to websites by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Some library associations also claimed that the legislation's emphasis on stronger copyright enforcement would expose libraries to prosecution. Other opponents claimed that requiring search engines to delete domain names violated the First Amendment and could begin a worldwide arms race of unprecedented Internet censorship.\n\nOn January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia, Google, and an estimated 7,000 other smaller websites coordinated a service blackout, in protest against the bill. Wikipedia said more than 162 million people viewed its banner. Other protests against SOPA and PIPA included petition drives, with Google stating it collected over seven million signatures, boycotts of companies and organizations that support the legislation, and an opposition rally held in New York City. In response to the protest actions, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) stated, \"It's a dangerous and troubling development when the platforms that serve as gateways to information intentionally skew the facts to incite their users and arm them with misinformation\", and \"it's very difficult to counter the misinformation when the disseminators also own the platform.\" Access to websites of several pro-SOPA organizations and companies such as RIAA, CBS.com, and others was impeded or blocked with denial-of-service attacks which started on January 19, 2012. Self-proclaimed members of the \"hacktivist\" group Anonymous claimed responsibility and stated the attacks were a protest of both SOPA and the United States Department of Justice's shutdown of Megaupload on that same day.\n\nSome opponents of the bill support the Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act (OPEN) as an alternative. On January 20, 2012, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Smith postponed plans to draft the bill: \"The committee remains committed to finding a solution to the problem of online piracy that protects American intellectual property and innovation ... The House Judiciary Committee will postpone consideration of the legislation until there is wider agreement on a solution.\"\n\nBill 3261 or , was a proposed law that was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on October 26, 2011, by House Judiciary Committee Chair Representative Lamar S. Smith (R-TX) and a bipartisan group of 12 initial co-sponsors. Presented to the House Judiciary Committee, it builds on the similar PRO-IP Act of 2008 and the corresponding Senate bill, the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA).\n\nThe originally proposed bill would allow the United States Department of Justice, as well as copyright holders, to seek court orders against websites outside U.S. jurisdiction accused of enabling or facilitating copyright infringement. A court order requested by the DOJ could include barring online advertising networks and payment facilitators from conducting business with websites found to infringe on federal criminal intellectual-property laws, barring search engines from linking to such sites, and requiring Internet service providers to block access to such sites.\n\nThe bill establishes a two-step process for intellectual property-rights holders to seek relief if they have been harmed by a site dedicated to infringement. The rights holder must first notify, in writing, related payment facilitators and ad networks of the identity of the website, who, in turn, must then forward that notification and suspend services to that identified website, unless that site provides a counter notification explaining how it is not in violation. The rights holder can then sue for limited injunctive relief against the site operator, if such a counter notification is provided, or if the payment or advertising services fail to suspend service in the absence of a counter notification.\n\nThe second section covers penalties for streaming video and for selling counterfeit drugs, military materials, or consumer goods. The bill would increase penalties and expand copyright offenses to include unauthorized streaming of copyrighted content and other intellectual property offenses. The bill would criminalize unauthorized streaming of copyrighted content if they knowingly misrepresent the activity of the site, with a maximum penalty of five years in prison for ten such infringements within six months. The copyrighted content can be removed, and infringements can lead to the site being shut down. In July 2013, the Department of Commerce's Internet Policy Task Force issued a report endorsing \"[a]dopting the same range of penalties for criminal streaming of copyrighted works to the public as now exists for criminal reproduction and distribution.\"\n\nThe bill provides immunity from liability to the ad and payment networks that comply with this Act or that take voluntary action to sever ties to such sites. Any copyright holder who knowingly misrepresents that a website is involved in copyright infringement would be liable for damages.\n\nSupporters include the Motion Picture Association of America, pharmaceuticals makers, media businesses, and the United States Chamber of Commerce. They state it protects the intellectual-property market and corresponding industry, jobs and revenue, and is necessary to bolster enforcement of copyright laws, especially against foreign websites. They cite examples such as Google's $500 million settlement with the Department of Justice for its role in a scheme to target U.S. consumers with ads to illegally import prescription drugs from Canadian pharmacies.\n\nOpponents state that it violates the First Amendment, is Internet censorship, will cripple the Internet, and will threaten whistle-blowing and other free speech actions.\n\nIn October, 2011, co-sponsor Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's Intellectual Property sub-panel, told \"The Hill\" that SOPA is a rewrite of the Senate's bill that addresses some tech-industry concerns, noting that under the House version of the legislation copyright holders won't be able to directly sue intermediaries such as search engines to block infringing websites and would instead need a court's approval before taking action against third parties.\n\nOn December 12, 2011 a revised version of the bill was tabled. Titled the \"Manager's Amendment\", it contained a number of changes in response to criticism of the original. As part of the revisions, the definition of sites that might be subject to enforcement was narrowed: the amendment limited such actions to sites that are designed or operated with the intent to promote copyright infringement, and it now only applies to non-US sites.\n\nAccording to Rep. Goodlatte, \"Intellectual property is one of America's chief job creators and competitive advantages in the global marketplace, yet American inventors, authors, and entrepreneurs have been forced to stand by and watch as their works are stolen by foreign infringers beyond the reach of current U.S. laws. This legislation will update the laws to ensure that the economic incentives our Framers enshrined in the Constitution over 220 years ago—to encourage new writings, research, products, and services— remain effective in the 21st century's global marketplace, which will create more American jobs.\"\n\nRights holders see intermediaries—the companies who host, link to, and provide e-commerce around the content—as the only accessible defendants.\n\nSponsor Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) said, \"Millions of American jobs hang in the balance, and our efforts to protect America's intellectual property are critical to our economy's long-term success.\" Smith added, \"The Stop Online Piracy Act helps stop the flow of revenue to rogue websites and ensures that the profits from American innovations go to American innovators.\"\n\nThe Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) representative who testified before the committee said that the motion picture and film industry supported two million jobs and 95,000 small businesses.\n\nPfizer spokesman John Clark testified that patients could not always detect cleverly-forged websites selling drugs that were either misbranded or simply counterfeit.\n\nRxRights, a consumer-advocacy group, issued a statement saying that Clark failed \"to acknowledge that there are Canadian and other international pharmacies that do disclose where they are located, require a valid doctor's prescription and sell safe, brand-name medications produced by the same leading manufacturers as prescription medications sold in the U.S.\" They had earlier said that SOPA \"fails to distinguish between counterfeit and genuine pharmacies\" and would prevent American patients from ordering their medications from Canadian pharmacies online.\n\nBill sponsor Smith accused Google of obstructing the bill, citing its $500 million settlement with the DOJ on charges that it allowed ads from Canadian pharmacies, leading to illegal imports of prescription drugs. Shipment of prescription drugs from foreign pharmacies to customers in the US typically violates the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Controlled Substances Act.\n\nMentioned on the Texas Insider, President Obama \"will not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression\", said interviewer Jay Carney.\n\nOn \"TIME\"'s \"Techland blog\", Jerry Brito wrote, \"Imagine if the U.K. created a blacklist of American newspapers that its courts found violated celebrities' privacy? Or what if France blocked American sites it believed contained hate speech?\" Similarly, the Center for Democracy and Technology warned, \"If SOPA and PIPA are enacted, the US government must be prepared for other governments to follow suit, in service to whatever social policies they believe are important—whether restricting hate speech, insults to public officials, or political dissent.\"\n\nLaurence H. Tribe, a Harvard University professor of constitutional law, released an open letter on the web stating that SOPA would \"undermine the openness and free exchange of information at the heart of the Internet. And it would violate the First Amendment\".\n\nThe AFL–CIO's Paul Almeida, arguing in favor of SOPA, has stated that free speech was not a relevant consideration, because \"Freedom of speech is not the same as lawlessness on the Internet. There is no inconsistency between protecting an open Internet and safeguarding intellectual property. Protecting intellectual property is not the same as censorship; the First Amendment does not protect stealing goods off trucks.\"\n\nAccording to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, proxy servers, such as those used during the Arab Spring, can also be used to thwart copyright enforcement and therefore may be regulated by the act.\n\nJohn Palfrey, co-director of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society, expressed disagreement with the use of his research findings to support SOPA. He wrote that \"SOPA would make many DNS circumvention tools illegal,\" which could put \"dissident communities\" in autocratic countries \"at much greater risk than they already are.\" He added, \"The single biggest funder of circumvention tools has been and remains the U.S. government, precisely because of the role the tools play in online activism. It would be highly counter-productive for the U.S. government to both fund and outlaw the same set of tools.\"\n\nMarvin Ammori has stated the bill might make The Tor Project illegal. Initially sponsored by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, the Tor Project creates encryption technology used by dissidents in repressive regimes (that consequently outlaw it). Ammori says that the U.S. Supreme Court case of \"Lamont v. Postmaster General\" 381 U.S. 301 (1965) makes it clear that Americans have the First Amendment right to read and listen to such foreign dissident free speech, even if those foreigners themselves lack an equivalent free speech right (for example, under their constitution or through Optional Protocols under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights).\n\nOpponents have warned that SOPA could have a negative impact on online communities. Journalist Rebecca MacKinnon argued in an op-ed that making companies liable for users' actions could have a chilling effect on user-generated sites such as YouTube. \"The intention is not the same as China's Great Firewall, a nationwide system of Web censorship, but the practical effect could be similar,\" Mackinnon stated. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) warned that websites Etsy, Flickr and Vimeo all seemed likely to shut down if the bill becomes law. Policy analysts for New America Foundation say this legislation would enable law enforcement to take down an entire domain due to something posted on a single blog, arguing, \"an entire largely innocent online community could be punished for the actions of a tiny minority\".\n\nAdditional concerns include the possible impact on common Internet functions such as links from one site to another or accessing data from the cloud. EFF claimed the bill would ban linking to sites deemed offending, even in search results and on services such as Twitter. Christian Dawson, Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Virginia-based hosting company ServInt, predicted that the legislation would lead to many cloud computing and Web hosting services moving out of the US to avoid lawsuits. Even without SOPA, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) has already launched extradition proceedings against Richard O'Dwyer in the UK. O'Dwyer hosted the TVShack.net website which had links to material elsewhere and did not host any files. ICE has stated that it intends to pursue websites even if their only connection to the USA is a .com or .net web domain.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation has stated that the requirement that any site must self-police user generated content would impose significant liability costs and explains \"why venture capitalists have said en masse they won't invest in online startups if PIPA and SOPA pass\".\n\nProponents of the bill countered these claims, arguing that filtering is already common. Michael O'Leary of the MPAA testified on November 16 that the act's effect on business would be more minimal, noting that at least 16 countries already block websites and that the Internet still functions in those countries. MPAA Chairman Chris Dodd noted that Google figured out how to block sites when China requested it. Some ISPs in Denmark, Finland, Ireland and Italy blocked The Pirate Bay after courts ruled in favor of music and film industry litigation, and a coalition of film and record companies has threatened to sue British Telecom if it does not follow suit. Maria Pallante of the United States Copyright Office said that Congress had updated the Copyright Act before and should again, or \"the U.S. copyright system will ultimately fail.\" Asked for clarification, she said that the US currently lacks jurisdiction over websites in other countries.\n\nThe 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) includes the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act, that provides a \"safe harbor\" for websites that host content. Under that provision, copyright owners who felt that a site was hosting infringing content are required to request the site to remove the infringing material within a certain amount of time. SOPA would bypass this \"safe harbor\" provision by placing the responsibility for detecting and policing infringement onto the site itself, and allowing judges to block access to websites \"dedicated to theft of U.S. property\".\n\nAccording to critics of the bill such as the Center for Democracy and Technology and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the bill's wording is vague enough that a single complaint about a site could be enough to block it, with the burden of proof resting on the site. A provision in the bill states that any site would be blocked that \"is taking, or has taken deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability of the use of the U.S.-directed site to carry out acts that constitute a violation.\" Critics have read this to mean that a site must actively monitor its content and identify violations to avoid blocking, rather than relying on others to notify it of such violations.\n\nLaw professor Jason Mazzone wrote, \"Damages are also not available to the site owner unless a claimant 'knowingly materially' misrepresented that the law covers the targeted site, a difficult legal test to meet. The owner of the site can issue a counter-notice to restore payment processing and advertising, but services need not comply with the counter-notice.\"\n\nGoodlatte stated, \"We're open to working with them on language to narrow [the bill's provisions], but I think it is unrealistic to think we're going to continue to rely on the DMCA notice-and-takedown provision. Anybody who is involved in providing services on the Internet would be expected to do some things. But we are very open to tweaking the language to ensure we don't impose extraordinary burdens on legitimate companies as long as they aren't the primary purveyors [of pirated content].\"\n\nO'Leary submitted written testimony in favor of the bill that expressed guarded support of current DMCA provisions. \"Where these sites are legitimate and make good faith efforts to respond to our requests, this model works with varying degrees of effectiveness,\" O'Leary wrote. \"It does not, however, always work quickly, and it is not perfect, but it works.\"\n\nAn analysis in the information technology magazine \"eWeek\" stated, \"The language of SOPA is so broad, the rules so unconnected to the reality of Internet technology and the penalties so disconnected from the alleged crimes that this bill could effectively kill e-commerce or even normal Internet use. The bill also has grave implications for existing U.S., foreign and international laws and is sure to spend decades in court challenges.\"\n\nArt Bordsky of advocacy group Public Knowledge similarly stated, \"The definitions written in the bill are so broad that any US consumer who uses a website overseas immediately gives the US jurisdiction the power to take action against it potentially.\"\n\nOn October 28, 2011, the EFF called the bill a \"massive piece of job-killing Internet regulation,\" and said, \"This bill cannot be fixed; it must be killed.\"\n\nGary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, spoke out strongly against the bill, stating, \"The bill attempts a radical restructuring of the laws governing the Internet\", and that \"It would undo the legal, safe harbors that have allowed a world-leading Internet industry to flourish over the last decade. It would expose legitimate American businesses and innovators to broad and open-ended liability. The result will be more lawsuits, decreased venture capital investment, and fewer new jobs.\"\n\nLukas Biewald, founder of CrowdFlower, stated, \"It'll have a stifling effect on venture capital... No one would invest because of the legal liability.\"\n\nBooz & Company on November 16 published a Google-funded study finding that almost all of the 200 venture capitalists and angel investors interviewed would stop funding digital media intermediaries if the bill became law. More than 80 percent said they would rather invest in a risky, weak economy with the current laws than a strong economy with the proposed law in effect. If legal ambiguities were removed and good faith provisions in place, investing would increase by nearly 115 percent.\n\nAs reported by David Carr of \"The New York Times\" in an article critical of SOPA and PIPA, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other companies sent a joint letter to Congress, stating \"We support the bills' stated goals – providing additional enforcement tools to combat foreign 'rogue' Web sites that are dedicated to copyright infringement or counterfeiting. However, the bills as drafted would expose law-abiding U.S. Internet and technology companies to new uncertain liabilities, private rights of action and technology mandates that would require monitoring of Web sites. We are concerned that these measures pose a serious risk to our industry's continued track record of innovation and job creation, as well as to our nation's cybersecurity.\" Smith responded, saying, the article \"unfairly criticizes the Stop Online Piracy Act\", and, \"does not point to any language in the bill to back up the claims. SOPA targets only foreign Web sites that are primarily dedicated to illegal and infringing activity. Domestic Web sites, like blogs, are not covered by this legislation.\" Smith also said that Carr incorrectly framed the debate as between the entertainment industry and high-tech companies, noting support by more than \"120 groups and associations across diverse industries, including the United States Chamber of Commerce\".\n\nLateef Mtima, director of the Institute for Intellectual Property and Social Justice at Howard University School of Law, expressed concern that users who upload copyrighted content to sites could potentially be held criminally liable themselves, saying, \"Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of the bill is that the conduct it would criminalize is so poorly defined. While on its face the bill seems to attempt to distinguish between commercial and non-commercial conduct, purportedly criminalizing the former and permitting the latter, in actuality the bill not only fails to accomplish this but, because of its lack of concrete definitions, it potentially criminalizes conduct that is currently permitted under the law.\"\n\nAn aide to Rep. Smith said, \"This bill does not make it a felony for a person to post a video on YouTube of their children singing to a copyrighted song. The bill specifically targets websites dedicated to illegal or infringing activity. Sites that host user content—like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter—have nothing to be concerned about under this legislation.\"\n\nA paper by the Center for Democracy and Technology claimed that the bill \"targets an entire website even if only a small portion hosts or links to some infringing content.\" \n\nAccording to A. M. Reilly of \"Industry Leaders Magazine\", under SOPA, culpability for distributing copyright material is extended to those who aid the initial poster of the material. For companies that use virtual private networks (VPN) to create a network that appears to be internal but is spread across various offices and employees' homes, any of these offsite locations that initiate sharing of copyright material could put the entire VPN and hosting company at risk of violation.\n\nAnswering similar criticism in a CNET editorial, Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) head, Cary Sherman wrote, \"Actually, it's quite the opposite. By focusing on specific sites rather than entire domains, action can be targeted against only the illegal subdomain or Internet protocol address rather than taking action against the entire domain.\"\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation expressed concern that free and open source software (FLOSS) projects found to be aiding online piracy could experience serious problems under SOPA. Of special concern was the web browser Firefox, which has an optional extension, MAFIAAFire Redirector, that redirects users to a new location for domains that were seized by the U.S. government. In May 2011, Mozilla refused a request by the United States Department of Homeland Security to remove MAFIAAFire from its website, questioning whether the software had ever been declared illegal.\n\nEdward J. Black, president and CEO of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, wrote in the \"Huffington Post\" that \"Ironically, it would do little to stop actual pirate websites, which could simply reappear hours later under a different name, if their numeric web addresses aren't public even sooner. Anyone who knows or has that web address would still be able to reach the offending website.\"\n\nAn editorial in the \"San Jose Mercury-News\" stated, \"Imagine the resources required to parse through the millions of Google and Facebook offerings every day looking for pirates who, if found, can just toss up another site in no time.\"\n\nJohn Palfrey of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society commented, \"DNS filtering is by necessity either overbroad or underbroad; it either blocks too much or too little. Content on the Internet changes its place and nature rapidly, and DNS filtering is ineffective when it comes to keeping up with it.\"\n\nSOPA has largely been declared unconstitutional by the majority of Internet users. However, there are potential positive effects that could arise from passing the bill. A great number of jobs and industries are dependent on intellectual property, and many people could benefit from better control and enforcement of their IP rights. The bill is supported by many media and film production companies, as well as renowned brand names like Nike who could see great financial benefits from having their copyrighted materials better protected. The implementation of SOPA or a similar policy could even potentially turn stock price declines of companies like Zynga and Netflix around. Producers of Internet content would benefit from SOPA in that it makes targeting copyright violators easier and less costly. SOPA also encourages ISPs and website owners to be proactive and make sure that their sites, products, and services are not engaging in or facilitating high levels of copyright infringement – i.e., that their success does not depend on violating the rights of those who hold copyrighted material. SOPA may also be beneficial for preventing abuse of safe harbors. Some provisions within the bill would allow the US Attorney General to completely prohibit US internet users and servers from conducting business with sites that infringe upon IP rights, incentivizing careful self-monitoring. It essentially aims to encourage safer transactions and fair returns to the creators and owners of valuable IP. Those who do comply to IP legislation are currently at a competitive disadvantage, but bills like SOPA can reduce this disadvantage particularly against foreign sites.\n\nAccording to Markham Erickson, head of NetCoalition, which opposes SOPA, the section of the bill that would allow judges to order internet service providers to block access to infringing websites to customers located in the United States would also allow the checking of those customers' IP address, a method known as IP address blocking. Erickson has expressed concerns that such an order might require those providers to engage in \"deep packet inspection,\" which involves analyzing all of the content being transmitted to and from the user, raising new privacy concerns.\n\nPolicy analysts for New America Foundation say this legislation would \"instigate a data obfuscation arms race\" whereby by increasingly invasive practices would be required to monitor users' web traffic resulting in a \"counterproductive cat-and-mouse game of censorship and circumvention [that] would drive savvy scofflaws to darknets while increasing surveillance of less technically proficient Internet users\".\n\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) servers, sometimes likened to a telephone directory, translate browser requests for domain names into the IP address assigned to that computer or network. The original bill requires these servers to stop referring requests for infringing domains to their assigned IP addresses. DNS is robust by design against failure and requires that a lack of response is met by inquiries to other DNS servers.\n\nAndrew Lee, CEO of ESET North America, objected that since the bill would require internet service providers to filter DNS queries for the sites, this would undermine the integrity of the Domain Name System.\n\nAccording to David Ulevitch, the San Francisco-based head of OpenDNS, the passage of SOPA could cause Americans to switch to DNS providers located in other countries who offer encrypted links, and may cause U.S. providers, such as OpenDNS itself, to move to other countries, such as the Cayman Islands.\n\nIn November 2011, an anonymous top-level domain, .bit, was launched outside of ICANN control, as a response to the perceived threat from SOPA, although its effectiveness (as well as the effectiveness of other alternative DNS roots) remains unknown.\n\nOn January 12, 2012, House sponsor Lamar Smith announced that provisions related to DNS redirection would be pulled from the bill.\n\nA white paper by several internet security experts, including Steve Crocker and Dan Kaminsky, wrote, \"From an operational standpoint, a resolution failure from a nameserver subject to a court order and from a hacked nameserver would be indistinguishable. Users running secure applications need to distinguish between policy-based failures and failures caused, for example, by the presence of an attack or a hostile network, or else downgrade attacks would likely be prolific.\"\n\nStewart Baker, former first Assistant Secretary for Policy at the Department of Homeland Security and former General Counsel of the National Security Agency, stated that SOPA would do \"great damage to Internet security\" by undermining Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), a proposed security upgrade for DNS, since a browser must treat all redirects the same, and must continue to search until it finds a DNS server (possibly overseas) providing untampered results. On December 14, 2011 he wrote that SOPA was \"badly in need of a knockout punch\" due to its impact on security and DNS:\n\nDNSSEC is a set of protocols developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for ensuring internet security. A white paper by the Brookings Institution noted, \"The DNS system is based on trust\", adding that DNSSEC was developed to prevent malicious redirection of DNS traffic, and that \"other forms of redirection will break the assurances from this security tool\".\n\nOn November 17, Sandia National Laboratories, a research agency of the U.S. Department of Energy, released a technical assessment of the DNS filtering provisions in the House and Senate bills, in response to Representative Zoe Lofgren's (D-CA) request. The assessment stated that the proposed DNS filtering would be unlikely to be effective, would negatively impact internet security, and would delay full implementation of DNSSEC.\n\nOn November 18, House Cybersecurity Subcommittee chair Dan Lungren stated that he had \"very serious concerns\" about SOPA's impact on DNSSEC, adding, \"we don't have enough information, and if this is a serious problem as was suggested by some of the technical experts that got in touch with me, we have to address it\".\n\nBrooklyn Law School professor Jason Mazzone warned, \"Much of what will happen under SOPA will occur out of the public eye and without the possibility of holding anyone accountable. For when copyright law is made and enforced privately, it is hard for the public to know the shape that the law takes and harder still to complain about its operation.\"\n\nThe Stop Online Piracy Act was introduced by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) and was initially co-sponsored by Howard Berman (D-CA), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mary Bono Mack (R-CA), Steve Chabot (R-OH), John Conyers (D-MI), Ted Deutch (D-FL), Elton Gallegly (R-CA), Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), Timothy Griffin (R-AR), Dennis A. Ross (R-FL), Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Lee Terry (R-NE). As of January 16, 2012, there were 31 sponsors.\n\nThe legislation has broad support from organizations that rely on copyright, including the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America, Entertainment Software Association, Macmillan US, Viacom, and various other companies and unions in the cable, movie, and music industries. Supporters also include trademark-dependent companies such as Nike, L'Oréal, and Acushnet Company.\n\nBoth the AFL–CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce support H.R. 3261, and many trade unions and industry groups large and small, have also publicly praised the legislation. In a joint statement, the American Federation of Musicians (AFM), American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), Directors Guild of America (DGA), International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States, Its Territories and Canada (IATSE), International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) all showed support for SOPA. Smaller trade organizations, such as A2IM, which represents independent musicians, have also backed the bill.\n\nIn June 2011, former Bill Clinton press secretary Mike McCurry and former George W. Bush advisor Mark McKinnon, business partners in Public Strategies, Inc., started a campaign which echoed McCurry's earlier work in the network neutrality legislative fight. McCurry represented SOPA/PIPA in \"Politico\" as a way to combat theft online, drawing a favorable comment from the MPAA. On the 15th, McCurry and Arts + Labs co-chair McKinnon sponsored the \"CREATE – A Forum on Creativity, Commerce, Copyright, Counterfeiting and Policy\" conference with members of Congress, artists and information-business executives.\n\nOn September 22, 2011, a letter signed by over 350 businesses and organizations—including NBCUniversal, Pfizer, Ford Motor Company, Revlon, NBA, and Macmillan US—was sent to Congress encouraging the passage of the legislation. Fightonlinetheft.com, a website of The Coalition Against Counterfeiting and Piracy (a project of the United States Chamber of Commerce Global Intellectual Property Center,) cites a long list of supporters including these and the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Governors Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Attorneys General, the Better Business Bureau, and the National Consumers League.\n\nOn November 22 the CEO of the Business Software Alliance (BSA) said, \"valid and important questions have been raised about the bill.\" He said that definitions and remedies needed to be tightened and narrowed, but \"BSA stands ready to work with Chairman Smith and his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to resolve these issues\".\n\nOn December 5, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a non-partisan non-profit, published an article that blasted critics of SOPA and defended the bill. The report called opponents' claims about DNS filtering \"inaccurate,\" their warnings against censorship as \"unfounded\" and recommended that the legislation be revised and passed into law.\n\nOn December 22, Go Daddy, one of the world's largest domain name registrars, stated that it supported SOPA. Go Daddy then rescinded its support, its CEO saying, \"Fighting online piracy is of the utmost importance, which is why Go Daddy has been working to help craft revisions to this legislation—but we can clearly do better. It's very important that all Internet stakeholders work together on this. Getting it right is worth the wait. Go Daddy will support it when and if the Internet community supports it.\"\n\nIn January 2012, the Entertainment Software Association announced support for SOPA, although some association members expressed opposition. Creative America, a group representing television networks, movie studios, and entertainment unions, produced a \"fact vs. fiction\" flyer that aimed to correct misperceptions about rogue sites legislation.\n\nProfessor and Intellectual Property rights lawyer, Hillel I. Parness, a Partner of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi has reviewed the bill, stating in a legal analysis that \"There's a court involved here.\" In regards to \"safe harbors,\" he stated the safe harbor provisions created by the DMCA in 1998 would still apply. \"I think the proponents of the bill would say, what we're looking at today is a very different kind of Internet. The fact that the courts have said that entities like YouTube can be passive when it comes to copyright infringement, and just wait for notices rather than having to take any affirmative action, is also frustrating to them\", he said. Regarding censorship concerns, he explained that none of the criminal copyright statutes in the bill were new, and therefore, \"if there was a risk of abuse, that risk has always been there. And I have confidence in the structure of our court system, that the prosecutors and the courts are held to certain standards that should not allow a statute such as this to be manipulated in that way.\"\n\nConstitutional law expert Floyd Abrams, on behalf of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), the Directors Guild of America (DGA), the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees (IATSE), the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and others, reviewed the proposed legislation and concluded, \"The notion that adopting legislation to combat the theft of intellectual property on the Internet threatens freedom of expression and would facilitate, as one member of the House of Representatives recently put it, 'the end of the Internet as we know it,' is thus insupportable. Copyright violations have never been protected by the First Amendment and have been routinely punished wherever they occur; including the Internet. This proposed legislation is not inconsistent with the First Amendment; it would protect creators of speech, as Congress has done since this Nation was founded, by combating its theft.\"\n\nOn January 14, 2012, the Obama administration responded to a petition against the bill, stating that while it would not support legislation with provisions that could lead to Internet censorship, squelching of innovation, or reduced Internet security, it encouraged \"all sides to work together to pass sound legislation this year that provides prosecutors and rights holders new legal tools to combat online piracy originating beyond U.S. borders while staying true to the principles outlined above in this response.\" More than 100,000 people petitioned the White House in protest. Three officials from the Obama administration articulated the White House's position on proposed anti-piracy legislation, balancing the need for strong antipiracy measures while respecting both freedom of expression and the way information and ideas are shared on the Internet. \"While we believe that online piracy by foreign websites is a serious problem that requires a serious legislative response, we will not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global Internet.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) expressed opposition to the bill, as well as Representatives Darrell Issa (R-CA) and presidential candidate Ron Paul (R-TX), who joined nine Democrats to sign a letter to other House members warning that the bill would cause \"an explosion of innovation-killing lawsuits and litigation\". \"Issa said the legislation is beyond repair and must be rewritten from scratch\", reported \"The Hill\". Issa and Lofgren announced plans for legislation offering \"a copyright enforcement process modeled after the U.S. International Trade Commission's (ITC) patent infringement investigations\". Politico referred to support as an \"election liability\" for legislators. Subsequently, proponents began hinting that key provisions might be deferred with opponents stating this was inadequate. Representative Jared Polis (D-CO) has been known to lobby against SOPA in the game League of Legends, also making a post in the official game message boards.\n\nOpponents include Google, Yahoo!, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, AOL, LinkedIn, eBay, Mozilla Corporation, Mojang, Riot Games, Epic Games, Reddit,\nWikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation, in addition to human rights organizations such as Reporters Without Borders, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the ACLU, and Human Rights Watch.\n\nKaspersky Lab, a major computer security company, demonstrated its opposition to SOPA and \"decided to discontinue its membership in the BSA\".\n\nOn December 13, 2011, Julian Sanchez of the libertarian think tank Cato Institute came out in strong opposition to the bill saying that while the amended version \"trims or softens a few of the most egregious provisions of the original proposal... the fundamental problem with SOPA has never been these details; it's the core idea. The core idea is still to create an Internet blacklist...\"\n\nThe Library Copyright Alliance (including the American Library Association) objected to the broadened definition of \"willful infringement\" and the introduction of felony penalties for noncommercial streaming infringement, stating that these changes could encourage criminal prosecution of libraries. A Harvard law professor's analysis said that this provision was written so broadly that it could make mainstream musicians felons for uploading covers of other people's music to sites like YouTube.\n\nOn November 22, Mike Masnick of Techdirt called SOPA \"toxic\" and published a detailed criticism of the ideas underlying the bill, writing that \"one could argue that the entire Internet enables or facilitates infringement\", and saying that a list of sites compiled by the entertainment industry included the personal site of one of their own artists, 50 Cent, and legitimate internet companies. The article questioned the effect of the bill on $2 trillion in GDP and 3.1 million jobs, with a host of consequential problems on investment, liability and innovation. Paul Graham, the founder of venture capital company Y Combinator opposed the bill, and banned all SOPA-supporting companies from their \"demo day\" events. \"If these companies are so clueless about technology that they think SOPA is a good idea\", he asks, \"how could they be good investors?\" Prominent pro-democracy movement, Avaaz.org started a petition in protest over SOPA and so far has got over 3.4 million signatures worldwide.\n\nThe Center for Democracy and Technology maintains a list of SOPA and PIPA opponents consisting of the editorial boards of \"The New York Times\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", 34 other organizations and hundreds of prominent individuals.\n\nZynga Game Network, creator of Facebook games \"Texas HoldEm Poker\" and \"FarmVille\", wrote to the sponsors of both bills highlighting concerns over the effect on \"the DMCA's safe harbor provisions ... [which] ... have been a cornerstone of the U.S. Technology and industry's growth and success\", and opposing the bill due to its impact on \"innovation and dynamism\".\n\nComputer scientist Vint Cerf, one of the founders of the Internet, now Google vice president, wrote to Smith, saying \"Requiring search engines to delete a domain name begins a worldwide arms race of unprecedented 'censorship' of the Web\", in a letter published on CNet.\n\nOn December 15, 2011, a second hearing was scheduled to amend and vote on SOPA. Many opponents remained firm even after Smith proposed a 71-page amendment to the bill to address concerns. NetCoalition, which works with Google, Twitter, eBay, and Facebook, appreciated that Smith was listening, but says it nonetheless could not support the amendment. Issa stated that Smith's amendment, \"retains the fundamental flaws of its predecessor by blocking Americans' ability to access websites, imposing costly regulation on Web companies and giving Attorney General Eric Holder's Department of Justice broad new powers to police the Internet\".\n\nIn December 2011, screenwriter and comics writer Steve Niles spoke out against SOPA, commenting, \"I know folks are scared to speak out because a lot of us work for these companies, but we have to fight. Too much is at stake.\"\n\nIn January 2012, novelist, screenwriter and comics writer Peter David directed his ire at the intellectual property pirates whose activities he felt provoked the creation of SOPA. While expressing opposition to SOPA because of his view that the then-current language of the bill would go too far in its restriction of free expression, and would probably be scaled down, David argued that content pirates, such as the websites that had posted his novels online in their entirety for free downloads, as well as users who supported or took advantage of these activities, could have prevented SOPA by respecting copyright laws.\n\nTwenty one artists signed an open letter to Congress urging them to exercise extreme caution, including Comedian Aziz Ansari, The Lonely Island music parody band, MGMT, OK Go, Jason Mraz and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. The letter reads, \"As creative professionals, we experience copyright infringement on a very personal level. Commercial piracy is deeply unfair and pervasive leaks of unreleased films and music regularly interfere with the integrity of our creations. We are grateful for the measures policymakers have enacted to protect our works. [...] We fear that the broad new enforcement powers provided under SOPA and PIPA could be easily abused against legitimate services like those upon which we depend. These bills would allow entire websites to be blocked without due process, causing collateral damage to the legitimate users of the same services - artists and creators like us who would be censored as a result.\" Filmmaker Michael Moore also shut down his websites during the week of protest,\nwhile other celebrities, including Ashton Kutcher, Alec Baldwin, and rapper B.o.B expressed their opposition via Twitter. \"The Daily Show\"s Jon Stewart stated that SOPA will \"break the Internet\".\n\nAccording to an NYT report (February 8, 2012), Art Brodsky of Public Knowledge said, \"The movie business is fond of throwing out numbers about how many millions of dollars are at risk and how many thousands of jobs are lost ... We don't think it correlates to the state of the industry.\" The report also noted that \"some in the internet world, including Tim O'Reilly, ... go so far as to question whether illegitimate downloading and sharing is such a bad thing. In fact, some say that it could even be a boon to artists and other creators.\" Tim O'Reilly is quoted as saying, \"The losses due to piracy are far outweighed by the benefits of the free flow of information, which makes the world richer, and develops new markets for legitimate content ... Most of the people who are downloading unauthorized copies of O'Reilly books would never have paid us for them anyway.\"\n\nOrganizations in the international civil and human rights community expressed concerns that SOPA would cause the United States to lose its position as a global leader in supporting a free and open Internet for public good.\n\nOn November 18, 2011, the European Parliament adopted by a large majority a resolution that \"stresses the need to protect the integrity of the global Internet and freedom of communication by refraining from unilateral measures to revoke IP addresses or domain names\".\n\nPrivate individuals are petitioning the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, asking for the British government to condemn the bill.\n\nVice-President of the European Commission and European Commissioner for Digital Agenda Neelie Kroes said she is \"Glad [the] tide is turning on SOPA,\" explaining rather than having \"bad legislation\" there \"should be safeguarding benefits of open net\". \"Speeding is illegal too but you don't put speed bumps on the motorway\", she said.\n\nNonetheless, Ireland may have a law similar to SOPA passed soon - and \"without Parliamentary vote\". The Irish law is entitled, \"S.I. No. 337/2011 — European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Universal Service and Users' Rights) Regulations 2011\".\n\nOn November 16, 2011, Tumblr, Mozilla, Techdirt, the Center for Democracy and Technology were among many Internet companies that protested by participating in American Censorship Day. They displayed black banners over their site logos with the words \"STOP CENSORSHIP.\" \n\nGoogle linked an online petition to its site, and says it collected more than 7 million signatures from the United States.\n\nMarkham Erickson, executive director of NetCoalition, told Fox News that \"a number of companies have had discussions about [blacking out services]\" and discussion of the option spread to other media outlets.\n\nIn January 2012, Reddit announced plans to black out its site for twelve hours on January 18, as company co-founder Alexis Ohanian announced he was going to testify to Congress. \"He's of the firm position that SOPA could potentially 'obliterate' the entire tech industry\", Paul Tassi wrote in \"Forbes\". Tassi also opined that Google and Facebook would have to join the blackout to reach a sufficiently broad audience. Other prominent sites that planned to participate in the January 18 blackout were Cheezburger Sites, Mojang, Major League Gaming, Boing Boing, BoardGameGeek, xkcd, SMBC and The Oatmeal.\n\nWider protests were considered and in some cases committed to by major internet sites, with high-profile bodies such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, Amazon, AOL, Reddit, Mozilla, LinkedIn, IAC, eBay, PayPal, WordPress and Wikimedia being widely named as \"considering\" or committed to an \"unprecedented\" internet blackout on January 18, 2012. On January 17 a Republican aide on Capitol Hill said that the protests were making their mark, with SOPA having already become \"a dirty word beyond anything you can imagine\".\n\nA series of pickets against the bill were held at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Two picketers were arrested.\n\nOn January 21, 2012 RT news reported, \"Bill Killed: SOPA death celebrated as Congress recalls anti-piracy acts\". The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a rights advocacy non-profit group opposing the bill, said the protests were the biggest in Internet history, with over 115 thousand sites altering their webpages.\n\nSOPA supporters complained that the bill was being misrepresented amidst the protests. RIAA spokesman Jonathan Lamy said, \"It's a dangerous and troubling development when the platforms that serve as gateways to information intentionally skew the facts to incite their users and arm them with misinformation\", a sentiment echoed by RIAA CEO Cary Sherman who said \"it's very difficult to counter the misinformation when the disseminators also own the platform\". At the American Constitution Society's 2012 National Convention, the Democratic Party's chief counsel to the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet said that the protests were \"orchestrated by misinformation by a few actors,\" adding that \"activism is welcome on the Hill, but... There's this thing called 'mob rule', and it's not always right.\"\n\nThe English Wikipedia blackout occurred for 24 hours on January 18–19, 2012. In place of , (with the exception of those for SOPA and PIPA themselves) the site showed only a message in protest of SOPA and PIPA asking visitors to \"Imagine a world without free knowledge.\" It is estimated in excess of 160 million people saw the banner. A month earlier, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales initiated discussion with editors regarding a potential knowledge blackout, a protest inspired by a successful campaign by the Italian-language Wikipedia to block the Italian DDL intercettazioni bill, terms of which could have infringed the encyclopedia's editorial independence. Editors and others mulled interrupting service for one or more days as in the Italian protest, or presenting site visitors with a blanked page directing them to further information before permitting them to complete searches. On January 16, the Wikimedia Foundation announced that the English-language Wikipedia would be blacked out for 24 hours on January 18.\n\nThe \"Daily Mail\" estimated that 7,000 smaller websites either joined in the blackout for the day or posted some kind of protest at the proposed legislation.\n\nSOPA's sponsor in the House, Chairman Smith, called Wikipedia's blackout a \"publicity stunt\" saying: \"It is ironic that a website dedicated to providing information is spreading misinformation about the Stop Online Piracy Act.\" Smith went on to insist that SOPA \"will not harm Wikipedia, domestic blogs or social networking sites\".\n\nOn January 19, 2012, Megaupload, a Hong Kong–based company providing file sharing services, was shut down by the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Barrett Brown, described as a spokesperson for the group Anonymous by the Russian state-run news outlet RT, said the timing of the Megaupload raid \"couldn't have come at a worse time in terms of the government's standpoint\". Some commentators and observers have asserted that the FBI shut down of Megaupload proves that SOPA and PIPA are unnecessary.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee held hearings on November 16 and December 15, 2011. The Committee was scheduled to continue debate in January 2012, but on January 17 Chairman Smith said that \"Due to the Republican and Democratic retreats taking place over the next two weeks, markup of the Stop Online Piracy Act is expected to resume in February.\" However, in the wake of online protests held on January 18, 2012, Rep. Lamar Smith has stated, \"The House Judiciary Committee will postpone consideration of the legislation until there is wider agreement on a solution\", and Sen. Reid announced that the PIPA test vote scheduled for January 24 would also be postponed.\n\nAt the House Judiciary Committee hearing, there was concern among some observers that the set of speakers who testified lacked technical expertise. Technology news site CNET reported \"One by one, each witness—including a lobbyist for the Motion Picture Association of America—said they weren't qualified to discuss... DNSSEC.\" Adam Thierer, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center, similarly said, \"The techno-ignorance of Congress was on full display. Member after member admitted that they really didn't have any idea what impact SOPA's regulatory provisions would have on the DNS, online security, or much of anything else.\"\n\nLofgren stated, \"We have no technical expertise on this panel today.\" She also criticized the tone of the hearing, saying, \"It hasn't generally been the policy of this committee to dismiss the views of those we are going to regulate. Impugning the motives of the critics instead of the substance is a mistake.\"\n\nLungren told Politico's \"Morning Tech\" that he had \"very serious concerns\" about SOPA's impact on DNSSEC, adding \"we don't have enough information, and if this is a serious problem as was suggested by some of the technical experts that got in touch with me, we have to address it. I can't afford to let that go by without dealing with it.\"\n\nGary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, stated, \"The significant potential harms of this bill are reflected by the extraordinary coalition arrayed against it. Concerns about SOPA have been raised by Tea Partiers, progressives, computer scientists, human rights advocates, venture capitalists, law professors, independent musicians, and many more. Unfortunately, these voices were not heard at today's hearing.\"\n\nAn editorial in \"Fortune\" wrote, \"This is just another case of Congress doing the bidding of powerful lobbyists—in this case, Hollywood and the music industry, among others. It would be downright mundane if the legislation weren't so draconian and the rhetoric surrounding it weren't so transparently pandering.\"\n\nSince its introduction, a number of opponents to the bill have expressed concerns. The bill was presented for markup by the House Judiciary Committee on December 15.\n\nAn aide to Smith stated that \"He is open to changes but only legitimate changes. Some site[s] are totally capable of filtering illegal content, but they won't and are instead profiting from the traffic of illegal content.\"\n\nAfter the first day of the hearing, more than 20 amendments had been rejected, including one by Darrell Issa which would have stripped provisions targeting search engines and Internet providers. \"PC World\" reported that the 22–12 vote on the amendment could foreshadow strong support for the bill by the committee.\n\nThe Committee adjourned on the second day agreeing to continue debate early in 2012. Smith announced a plan to remove the provision that requires Internet service providers to block access to certain foreign websites. On January 15, 2012, Issa said he has received assurances from Rep. Eric Cantor that the bill would not come up for a vote until a consensus could be reached.\n\nThe 2014 Sony Pictures hack revealed that the MPAA had continued its efforts to enact SOPA-like blocking principles since the bill died in Congress. The emails indicated that the MPAA was actively exploring new strategies to implement SOPA-like regulations, such as using the All Writs Act to \"allow [the MPAA] to obtain court orders requiring site blocking without first having to sue and prove the target ISPs are liable for copyright infringement.\"\nThe MPAA has also allied itself with National Association of Attorneys General president Jim Hood, who supports SOPA principles and has stated that \"Google's not a government… they don't owe anyone a First Amendment right… [i]f you're an illegal site, you ought to clean up your act, instead of Google making money off it.\" On November 27, 2013, Hood sent a letter to Google outlining his grievances. It was later revealed that much of the letter was drafted by the law firm representing the MPAA.\n\nOn October 21, 2014, Hood issued a subpoena to Google for information about, among other items, its advertising partnerships and practices concerning illegal and sexual content. Google requested an injunction to quash the subpoena from the United States District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi, Northern Division. Google was granted such an injunction on March 2, 2015. The injunction also prevented Hood from bringing a charge against Google for making third-party content available to internet users. Effectively, the injunction protected Google from having Hood's claims enforced until after the conclusion of the case.\n\nAn MPAA spokesperson criticized Google's use of the First Amendment, accusing the company of using freedom of speech \"as a shield for unlawful activities.\" Leaders in the technology industry commended the federal court for issuing the injunction. In addition, one of Google's head lawyers noted that \"[w]e're pleased with the court's ruling, which recognizes that the MPAA's long-running campaign to censor the web — which started with SOPA — is contrary to federal law.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1478067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1478067", "title": "Television in Ukraine", "text": "Television in Ukraine\n\nTelevision has a long history in Ukraine, with regular television broadcasting started during the former USSR years in 1951. However the first ever TV broadcast took place on the 1st February 1939 in Kyiv. Since then TV broadcasting has expanded, particularly after the fall of Communism in 1989, and now there are many different channels and groups in the Ukrainian TV market.\n\nThe first official broadcast took place in Kiev on 1 February 1939. It was 40 minutes long and showed the portrait of Sergo Ordzhonikidze. After World War II, on 6 November 1951, a Kyiv tele-centre made a debut with a \"live broadcasting\" of the patriotic movie \"The Great Glow\". Next day the telecentre went on air again by broadcasting the solemn measures of celebrating the 34th anniversary of the October Revolution.\n\nOn 1 May 1952, a concert went on air (shot in the small and only pavilion of the telecentre known as \"Studio B\") of Ukrainian singers, soloists of the Kyiv Taras Shevchenko Opera Theater. The anchorwoman of the concert was the Kyiv Telecentre's first announcer - Novela Separionova. In 1953, the construction of the building of the Kyiv Telecentre on Khreshchatyk was completed, right after the finishing of the Moscow and Leningrad Telecentres. Regular programs started to go on air in 1956. Until that year, the Telecentre went on air twice a day showing feature films or documentaries. Live broadcasting was the only form of broadcasting. Recording video became usual in the mid-1960s.\n\nThe first regular national channel appeared on January 20, 1965 under the name UT-1 (Ukrainian television - 1, today - Pershyi National), while on March 6, 1972 a second channel, UT-2, was created. In 1983, the new telecenter started to be built at the 42 Melnyk Street, which was opened after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1993.\n\nAfter the Orange Revolution, Ukrainian television became more free. In February 2009 the National Council for Television and Radio Broadcasting claimed that \"political pressure on mass media increased in recent times through amending laws and other normative acts to strengthen influence on mass media and regulatory bodies in this sphere\".\n\nAs of January 2009, Ukrainian Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko refused to appear in Inter TV-programmes \"until journalists, management and owners of the TV channel stop destroying the freedom of speech and until they remember the essence of their profession - honesty, objectiveness, and unbiased stand\".\n\nIn early March 2014, Crimea removed Ukraine-based TV channels ahead of its Russian annexation referendum. Later that month, the Ukrainian National Council for TV and Radio Broadcasting ordered measures against some Russian TV channels which were accused of broadcasting misleading information about Ukraine. In February 2015 the law \"On protection information television and radio space of Ukraine,\" banned the showing (on Ukrainian television) of \"audiovisual works\" that contain \"popularization, propaganda, propaganda, any action of law enforcement agencies, armed forces, other military, military or security forces of an invader\" was enacted. One year later Russian productions (on Ukrainian television) had decreased by 3 to 4 (times). 15 more Russian TV channels were banned in March 2016.\n\nAccording to the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No.509 dated June 13, 2018, analogue broadcasting was disconnected on the territory of the Kirvograd region and Kyiv from July 31, 2018. The date of the switch-off of analogue broadcasting on the rest of Ukraine is August 31, 2018.\n\nSince September 1, 2018 for TV viewers of Ukraine only the following channels will be available:\n\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, experimental DVB-T broadcasts of few channels started in Kyiv and Odesa. Those turned out to be successful. Yet the DTT National Program is not approved by the government, thus the process is stuck. Because there are two versions of the program submitted: from the Ministry of Transport and Communications as well as from the State Committee of Television and Radio, there is no particular progress in 2008.\n\nOn 26 November 2008, the National Program of the Ministry was approved, but the final version and the public announcement of this fact is still on hold. Current version of the program does not take into notice any kind of Government financing, and the budget is to be private only, which will highly affect the TV industry and commercial broadcasters.\n\nBesides there are 3rd parties, such as Television Industry Committee and National Association of Broadcasters which represent the communities of National and regional broadcasters respectively. Both organizations help the switchover not to affect the business of over 20 National and over 150 regional broadcasters.\n\nThe International Forum 'Digital Broadcasting in Ukraine' is the annual event that takes place in Kyiv, Ukraine. Its mission is to gather the most of international consultants and Ukrainian specialists to solve industry's problems in the DTT field. In 2008 the 2nd International Forum took place in Kyiv also. BBC, Deloitte and the Ministry of Communications of Finland representatives share the vision of possible plan of DTT implementation in Ukraine, delivering the best experiences from UK, Finland, France and US. Still none was taken into notice yet. It is now confirmed that Ukraine's national terrestrial TV network, which is scheduled to be launched in September 2011, will use the DVB-T2 standard for all four nationwide FTA multiplexes, for both SD and HD broadcasts. Before settling for DVB-T2, Ukraine was testing both DVB-T/MPEG-2 and DVB-T/MPEG-4 options, and some experimental transmitters operating in those standards are still live.\n\nCommercial MMDS digital TV services work in Kyiv and some other cities.\n\nDVB-C services delivering premium channels (in addition to standard analogue channels) launched in cable networks of Kiev, Odesa, Kremenchuk, Poltava, Donetsk and some other cities.\n\nAudience share (age 4 and older, whole Ukraine), December 2017:\n\n\n\n\nSociety criticise Ukrainian television, mainly a number of central channels for the presence of a big amount of Russian origin content. According to calculations of \"Boycott Russian Films\" activists, in September 2014 amount of Russian TV-production on the leading Ukrainian channels (\"Ukrayina\", \"ICTV\", \"NTN\", \"Novyi Kanal\", \"Inter\", \"STB\", \"2+2\", \"TET\", \"K1\", \"1+1\") took approximately 40%. In October and December activists noticed increasing of amounts of Russian content on this channels.\n\nAlso activists criticise Ukrainian channels for their language policy. In October 2014 activists have published statistics of content's language of Ukrainian channels. According to it there are 29% of completely Ukrainian language content, 39.3% of completely Russian language content, 23.5% of Russian language content with Ukrainian subtitles and 8.2% of bilingual content (both Ukrainian and Russian).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40008080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40008080", "title": "The Simpsons Guy", "text": "The Simpsons Guy\n\n\"The Simpsons Guy\" is the first episode of the thirteenth season of the American animated television series \"Family Guy\", and the 232nd overall episode. \"The Simpsons Guy\" is a 44-minute-long crossover with \"The Simpsons\", and was written by Patrick Meighan and directed by Peter Shin. It originally aired in the United States on September 28, 2014, on Fox, where both \"The Simpsons\" and \"Family Guy\" have aired since their respective debuts.\n\nIn the episode, the Griffins stay with the Simpsons after the former family's car is stolen just outside Springfield. After the Griffins get their car back, Peter is taken to court as a representative of the Pawtucket Patriot brewery, his employer, when it is discovered that its ale is an unauthorized copy of Duff Beer.\n\nThe idea for a crossover episode was suggested by \"Family Guy\" executive producer and former \"Simpsons\" writer Richard Appel, and the episode was announced by Fox in July 2013. Five of the six main members of the voice cast of \"The Simpsons\"—the exception being Harry Shearer—voiced their characters in the episode. \"The Simpsons Guy\" was met with a mixed reception by critics, who had differing opinions on how well the two shows combined.\n\nPeter creates a controversial comic panel for the Quahog newspaper called \"For Pete's Sake,\" which angers local women for its sexist humor. Peter drives the Griffin family out of Quahog to escape the townspeople's ire. When they stop at a gas station, their car is stolen, leaving them stranded outside Springfield. At the Kwik-E-Mart, Homer Simpson introduces himself to the Griffins and takes them to the Springfield Police Department, where they are turned away by Chief Wiggum.\n\nThe Simpson family puts up the Griffin family in their home until things improve. Bart shows Stewie his slingshot, and teaches him how to skateboard, and they become good friends. When Nelson Muntz bullies Bart, Stewie retaliates by kidnapping and torturing Nelson. Meanwhile, Lisa tries to find a talent that Meg has. When she finds that Meg is a natural at the saxophone, she downplays the talent out of jealousy. Chris and Brian take the Simpsons' dog, Santa's Little Helper, for a walk. Brian tries to teach Santa's Little Helper independence, but the latter runs off when freed. Marge notices Santa's Little Helper is missing, and Chris and Brian fake his presence until he eventually returns. Homer and Peter try different plans to find Peter's car, each one backfiring, until they discover it in the possession of Hans Moleman when he accidentally runs Peter over.\n\nThe men celebrate at Moe's Tavern, but relationships sour when Peter tries to introduce Homer to Pawtucket Patriot ale. The drink is revealed to be an imitation of Duff Beer with a new label. This results in Duff, represented by the Blue Haired Lawyer, filing a lawsuit against Pawtucket Brewery for patent infringement, with Peter forced to defend the brewery to save Quahog. Fred Flintstone is the judge who presides over the case. During the trial, similar characters from both shows interact with each other including both shows' versions of James Woods. Fred rules in favor of Duff Beer, but declares that both Pawtucket Patriot Ale and Duff Beer are imitations of his own favorite beer Bud Rock.\n\nThe Griffins prepare to return to Quahog, where Peter faces the prospect of finding a new job. Lisa gives Meg her saxophone, but Peter throws it away, claiming there is no room for any more luggage. Stewie points out that he took revenge on not just Nelson, but all of Bart's enemies: Nelson, Jimbo Jones, Principal Skinner, Sideshow Bob, and (for the sake of making a scatological pun) Apu. Bart is sickened by Stewie's violent tendencies and ends their friendship. Homer tries to explain his actions, but Peter reacts angrily and the two fight (à la fighting between Peter and The Giant Chicken) through Springfield. The pair gain superpowers when they hit the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, then end up in Kang and Kodos' spaceship, where they lose their powers before landing in Springfield Gorge. Peter and Homer stop fighting and admit their respect and admiration for each other while agreeing to stay away in the future. Returning home, the Griffins find that the heat from Peter's comic has died down and the Pawtucket Brewery is safe when Lois doubts that the inhabitants of Springfield will visit Quahog to enforce the ruling. Stewie tries to pretend he is over Bart, but goes to his room crying while writing \"I will not think about Bart anymore\" several times on a chalkboard.\n\nThe idea of a crossover with \"The Simpsons\" was first suggested while the thirteenth season of \"Family Guy\" was being planned out. Executive producer Richard Appel received \"Family Guy\" creator Seth MacFarlane's approval and input after brainstorming ideas. Appel then asked for permission from \"Simpsons\" executive producers Matt Groening, James L. Brooks and Al Jean to use their characters. This was approved; Appel was previously a writer-producer on \"The Simpsons\" for four seasons, and retained his former colleagues' trust. Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith and Hank Azaria guest star as their \"Simpsons\" characters, but Harry Shearer, the final main cast member of \"The Simpsons\", was unavailable. Asked how he felt about the crossover, Shearer replied, \"Matter and anti-matter.\"\n\n\"Family Guy\" writers pitched several storylines for the crossover, including one in which the Griffins stay with Lenny and Carl and never meet the Simpsons, and another one in which their whole series is revealed to be a figment of Ralph Wiggum's imagination. When the final script was read to the show's staff, Appel expressed his concern about the length of the episode. MacFarlane said that Fox would be happy to make it an hour long. Supervising director Peter Shin, a former layout artist on \"The Simpsons\", spent time adjusting the Griffins to the specifications of Springfield—changes included dimming the whites of their eyeballs so they would not look too bright—and animating the eight-minute fight between Peter and Homer. Appel said there are no plans to do a sequel to the episode, but stated that \"by season 43 of \"The Simpsons\" and season 27 of \"Family Guy\", someone who's looking at a blank board is going to say, 'Well, the Griffins went to Springfield... what if the Simpsons went to Quahog?' And more heads will explode at Fox.\"\n\nThe episode was first announced by Fox in July 2013 to premiere in the fall of 2014. In May 2014, the network presented two clips from the episode at their annual upfront presentation. In an interview with \"Entertainment Weekly\" about the episode, MacFarlane stated that the key to a good crossover episode is \"really about the character interaction. People want to see Peter interact with Homer. They want to see Bart interact with Stewie. In a way, the story in a crossover episode, while it has to be there, is never quite as important as how the characters interact with each other.\" \"The Simpsons\" creator Groening added, \"In this case, it's two really vivid shows and seeing what they can do together. You want to see them having a good time and you want to see Peter and Homer duke it out\".\n\n\"The Simpsons Guy\" includes cameo appearances by Roger of \"American Dad!\", Bob Belcher of \"Bob's Burgers\" and Fred Flintstone of \"The Flintstones\". The episode also pokes fun at the different characters' skin colors; upon entering Springfield, Peter warns the family not to drink the water because all the citizens appear to have hepatitis, while Homer refers to the Griffin family as \"our albino visitors\". The Springfield Gorge scene in Homer and Peter's fight sequence is a reference to the finale of the season two episode \"Bart the Daredevil\" in which Homer inadvertently ends up jumping the Gorge on Bart's skateboard.\n\nThe episode was watched by 8.45 million people. This was slightly more than the second season premiere of \"Resurrection\" on ABC but less than \"The Good Wife\" on CBS, both shows in the same timeslot. \"Clown in the Dumps\", the earlier premiere of the twenty-sixth season of \"The Simpsons\" was watched by 8.53 million.\n\n\"The Simpsons Guy\" received mixed reviews. Writing in \"USA Today\", Mike Foss gave the episode a positive review, but criticized how the episode was written by \"Family Guy\" staff and thus lacked elements of \"The Simpsons\" humor. Jason Hughes of \"TheWrap\" was also generally in praise of the episode, but felt that certain scenes—including both Peter and Homer's fight and an erotic car wash sequence—were \"squeamish\" and out of place for \"The Simpsons\". He however acknowledged that Bart's disgust at Stewie's behavior was \"a good statement\" of the difference between the two shows. Positive reviews of the crossover also came from IGN, the \"International Business Times\", the \"Standard-Examiner\", and TVLine.\n\nOther critics responded negatively. Scott Meslow, of \"The Week\", pointed out his disappointment that the episode parodied a scene in \"Bart the Daredevil\", as that episode dealt with Homer and Bart's relationship, but \"The Simpsons Guy\" used it as a joke in a violent sequence. Todd VanDerWerff wrote on VOX that while he expected the episode to be mediocre, it actually ended up a \"blight on humanity itself\". He listed nine reasons for this statement, including his dissatisfaction with the car wash and fight scenes, and the use of sexist jokes which had lost their shock value. After the episode aired in the United Kingdom in July 2015, Ellen E. Jones, of \"The Independent\", criticized the episode's rape jokes and violence, and theorized that with the poor box-office performance of his latest film \"Ted 2\", audiences were growing tired of MacFarlane's humor. Ed Power of \"The Daily Telegraph\", however, wrote that \"Family Guy\"s usual objectionable content was restrained in the episode, as if it had been \"infected\" by recent seasons of \"The Simpsons\".\n\n\"The A.V. Club\" named the episode among \"The worst TV of 2014\" under \"Worst crossover\", writing that \"for no real reason, Homer and Peter find themselves in an interminable 'sexy car wash' montage, sudsing and squirting each other in tied-off tees and denim cutoffs. \"Family Guy\" prides itself on cutaway gags, but the car-wash scene... is its most successful look-away gag\".\n\n\"The Simpsons Guy\" attracted controversy before it had aired. Tim Winter, the President of the Parents Television Council, a socially conservative media monitoring organization and longtime critic of \"Family Guy\", wrote to Matt Groening, Seth MacFarlane and Fox about a joke seen in the trailer for the episode. In it, after Bart's prank call to Moe asking for a man with an innuendo name, Stewie makes his own call and tells Moe that his sister is being raped. Winter felt that jokes about rape make it \"less outrageous in real life\", and that people who watch \"The Simpsons\" but not \"Family Guy\" would be unfamiliar with the latter show's brand of humor. A Fox spokeswoman declined to comment on the joke, while MacFarlane, interviewed by \"Entertainment Weekly\", said that although he would be attacked for stating it as such, the joke was \"pretty funny... in context\". A spokeswoman from the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network said \"I think the show is making it clear that rape is not funny by how they are positioning the joke.\"\n\nThe Parents Television Council declared the episode worst show of the week, saying that it was significantly distasteful to involve \"The Simpsons\" because although that series is rated PG, \"Family Guy\" aims \"to reach the most extreme and outlandish conclusion of any joke, no matter how harsh the punchline may be. For subjecting viewers to jokes about rape, cartoon nudity, and disturbing acts of violence, Fox's \"Family Guy\" will remain the Worst TV Show of the Week\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "668760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=668760", "title": "Town crier", "text": "Town crier\n\nA town crier, also called a bellman, is an officer of the court who makes public pronouncements as required by the court (cf. Black's Law Dictionary).\n\nThe town crier can also be used to make public announcements in the streets. Criers often dress elaborately, by a tradition dating to the 18th century, in a red and gold coat, white breeches, black boots and a tricorne hat.\n\nThey carry a handbell to attract people's attention, as they shout the words \"Oyez, Oyez, Oyez!\" before making their announcements. The word \"Oyez\" means \"hear ye,\" which is a call for silence and attention. \"Oyez\" derives from the Anglo-Norman word for \"listen\" (modern French, \"oyez\", infinitive, \"ouïr\", but largely replaced by the verb \"écouter\"). The proclamations book in Chester from the early 19th century records this as \"O Yes, O Yes!\"\n\nPrior to widespread literacy, town criers were the means of communication with the people of the town since many people could not read or write. Proclamations, local bylaws, market days, adverts, were all proclaimed by a bellman or crier.\n\nIn ancient Rome, they typically proclaimed public business during the market days that formed a kind of weekend every 8 days (9 days inclusively).\n\nIn Goslar, Germany, a crier was employed to remind the local populace not to urinate or defecate in the river the day before water was drawn for brewing beer.\n\nCriers were not always men, many town criers were women. Bells were not the only attention-getting device—in the Netherlands, a gong was the instrument of choice for many, and in France a drum was used, or a hunting horn.\n\nIn the observance of Allhallowtide, \"it was customary for criers dressed in black to parade the streets, ringing a bell of mournful sound and calling on all good Christians to remember the poor souls.\"\n\nIn order to gain the attention of the crowd, the crier would yell, \"Hear ye\" – \"Oyez\".\n\nIn Medieval England, town criers were the chief means of news communication with the townspeople, since many were illiterate in a period before the moveable type was invented. Royal proclamations, local bylaws, market days, adverts, even selling loaves of sugar were all proclaimed by a bellman or crier throughout the centuries—at Christmas 1798, the Chester Canal Co. sold some sugar damaged in their packet boat and this was to be advertised by the bellman.\n\nThe crier also escorted the destitute to the workhouse, installed minor criminals in the stocks and administered floggings. During public hangings he read out why the person was being hanged, and helped to cut him or her down.\n\nChester records of 1540 show fees due to the bellman included \"of every worshipful gentyllman that goyth onye gounes at ther buryall ...one goune [at funerals gowns would be given to mourners]. when he gythe or aneything that is lost ...jd [one penny]. for every bote lode with powder mellwylle [salted fish] ...one fyshe, for every boute lode with fresh fyshe that he goeth for ...jd [one penny].\" In 1556, a record shows \"To ye belman for p'claimyng ye Founder's dyryge 27 Januarij ...ijd [two pence on Henry VIII's death, the founder of the King's School].\"\n\nIn 1620, there was a fight at the Chester cross between the butchers and the bakers where the \"Cryer brake his Mace in peeces Amonge them\". In 1607, one public notice read by George Tunnall, the bellman, forbade tipping rubbish in the river. In 1715, a local man recorded that the \"Belman at the Cross ... Reads publicly a proclamation in the Mayor's name, commanding all persons in the City to be of peaceable and civil behaviour, not to walk around the Streets or Rows at unreasonable hours of night\". Chester once had a crier, a day bellman and a night bellman, but in 1734, John Posnitt took over as \"Day and Night Bellman.\"\n\nA 1701 will of the vicar at Waverton stated that notice was to be given \"by the Belman to the People of Chester, of the time when, and the place where my Corpse is to be buried\".\n\nSalmon fishing season was also closed by the bellman.\n\nThe term \"Posting A Notice\" comes from the act of the town crier, who having read his message to the townspeople, would attach it to the door post of the local inn. Some newspapers took the name \"The Post\" for this reason.\n\nTown criers were protected by law, as they sometimes brought bad news such as tax increases. Anything done by the town crier was done in the name of the ruling monarch and harming a town crier was considered to be treason. The phrase \"don't shoot the messenger\" was a real command.\n\nThere are two organizations representing town criers including the Ancient and Honourable Guild of Town Criers and Loyal Company of Town Criers.\n\nBy tradition, a copy of the Royal Proclamation about the dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is delivered by hand from the Privy Council Office to Mansion House in the City of London. It is then read out by the Common Crier (\"aka\" Mace-bearer) of the City on the steps of the Royal Exchange in the heart of the City, having been handed to him by the Common Serjeant of the City, ahead of its being also read out in the London boroughs.\n\nThere have been town criers in North America ever since Europeans have been coming to the continent. There are records throughout the 16th century of town criers in Mexico, Peru, and Panama. During the 1830s and 40s Halifax, Nova Scotia had as many as four in the city. All through the American Colonies and beyond, such as Santa Fe, New Mexico; Boston, Massachusetts and Stamford, Connecticut had criers during the mid 17th century. In some places, the office of town crier persisted into the early 20th century. At least as recently as 1904, Los Angeles and several adjacent towns had official town criers.\n\nIn many parts of India, the village crier traditionally carried a rustic drum to call public attention, following up with the message. The message had a typical flow, starting with \"people of (...) village, the headman would like to announce that...\" followed by the message.\n\nIn Nepal, the town crier is called a \"katuwal\" which derives from local Tibetic, \"kat\" 'voice' + an Indic suffix \"-wal\" 'kind of person' (see TGTM *\"kat\" 'voice' in ). Similar to the European counterpart, the \"katuwal\" is responsible for news and other announcements in some rural villages ( ; . The town crier is paid traditionally in grain after each harvest, a portion from each family in the village. The town crier not only makes public announcements, but makes announcements in particular neighborhoods when more labor or help is needed for daily work by other families out in the fields. This ensures that labor demands are met during more intensive work activities such as harvests, weeding, and planting.\n\nTown criers were prominent in the precolonial and colonial eras of Igboland, a West African region in the present-day Nigeria. They served as the major means of information dissemination in their respective communities.\n\nWhen the need for a town crier disappeared, the position passed into local folklore. Informal and later formal town crier competitions were held from the early 20th century. Subsequently, some cities and towns reinstated the post purely for ceremonial purposes.\n\nMany local councils in England and Wales reinstated the post of town crier from the mid-1990s onwards (e.g. Chester). Many are honorary appointments or employed part-time by the council. In October 2010, there were 144 towns in England and Wales with town criers registered with the Ancient and Honourable Guild of Town Criers. They mainly perform ceremonial duties at civic functions. Local councils with a paid town crier often make them available for charity events.\n\nIn the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, the town crier is also appointed the Tipstaff, an appointment which exists in no other local council.\n\nIn the 2010s in England, town criers still announce the births of royal heirs and occasionally the arrival of the royal family. Tony Appleton, an octogenarian and self-proclaimed “royalist crier,” took it upon himself to announce, as loudly as he can, important news about the royal family. Appleton has served as town crier for the nearby city of Romford, but he does not represent the royal family. Appleton admitted as much in 2013, when news outlets were confused by his presence.\n\nThere are several town crier guilds in both Canada and the United States. These include the Ontario Guild of Town Criers, the Nova Scotia Guild of Town Criers and the American Guild of Town Criers. In 2016, the town of Burlingame, California added a town crier.\n\nIn Australia, as of October 2010, the City of Sydney, City of Hobart, City of Greater Geelong, City of Portland, City of Ipswich, City of Gosford, City of Salisbury, City of Gold Coast and 22 other local councils had an official town crier.\n\nEuropean, Canadian, American, North American and Australian championships are held in alternating years with the World Championships.\n\nThe best dressed town crier at the World Championships in 2008 was Daniel Richer dit La Flêche representing the cities of Ottawa and Gatineau, in Canada.\n\nThe Best Dressed Couple were Peter and Maureen Taunton from the county town of Stafford, in Staffordshire, England. Richard Riddell of Anacortes, in the state of Washington in the United States, was the 2008 American Champion and winner of the 2009 Bermuda International Town Crier Competition. He was awarded Best Dressed and tied for First Runner-up at the 2010 World Tournament at Chester in England and Overall Winner at the 2013 World Invitational Town Crier Competition held in Kingston, in Ontario, Canada.\n\nPeter Moore, the London Town Crier, held the position for more than 30 years. He was Town Crier to the Mayor of London, the City of Westminster, and London boroughs, and was also a Freeman and Liveryman of the City of London. He died on 20 December 2009.\n\nAlan Myatt holds two Guinness World Records. As well as being the loudest crier (recording a cry of 112.8 decibels), he also set the record for vocal endurance, issuing a one-hundred word proclamation every 15 minutes for a period of 48 hours.\n\nDaniel Richer dit La Flêche, who is a member of the First Nations Abenaki tribe, is a full-time bilingual town crier. David Hinde, Bridlington Town Crier, was measured at 114.8 decibels.\n\nTaking place from the 20th to 23 August 2014, Chris Whyman from Kingston, Ontario, Canada, was declared the winner of the 2014 World Town Crier Tournament in Chester.\n\nIn October 2015, Paddy-Ann Pemberton hosted an International World Town Crier Invitational Tournament over seven days in Central Otago. The three days of competition produced Ken Knowles of Lichfield, England as the winner, Jerry Praver (USA) was second, Daniel Richer Dit La Fleche (Ottawa) was third. Knowles won each of the daily competitions held at three different venues: Aleaxandra, Roxburgh and Cromwell, all in Central Otago, New Zealand.\n\nIn September 2017, Gary Long, with some assistance from Lloyd Smith and Peter Davies, hosted the same International Invitational Competition in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia, Canada. Nineteen top town criers came from Australia, New Zealand, California, Maryland, Ontario, Nova Scotia and England to compete in the three round event. The rounds were held in Windsor, Annapolis Royal and Grand Pre. Mark Molnar of St. Catharines Ontario won. Paul Gough of Nuneaton and Bedworth England came second and Daniel Richer dit LaFleche came third.\n\nThe 25th Annual National Town Crier Championships was hosted by Redland City Council and Redland Town Crier Maxwell Bissett in Redland City on 3 September 2016. The competition took place as part of the Redland Spring Festival, RedFest. Members of the Ancient and Honourable Guild of Australian Town Criers competed for champion titles. The 2016 theme of the competition is \"The History and Diversity of the Redlands.\"\n\n\n\nhttp://www.loyalcompanyoftowncriers.co.uk/The Loyal Company of Town Criers (UK)\n"}

At Laffan's Plain Cody wished to demonstrate how his Flying Cathedral biplanes had the greatest lateral stability even with a passenger away from the aircraft's center of gravity.\nThe first wing walker to perform daring stunts was 26-year-old Ormer Locklear. Legend has it that he first climbed out onto the lower wings during his pilot training in the Army Air Service during World War I. Undaunted, Ormer just climbed out of the cockpit onto the wings in flight whenever there was a mechanical issue and fixed the problem.\n\nOn , Locklear wowed the crowd at Barron Field, Texas, with the first public performance of his daredevil wing-walking stunts. Wing walking was seen as an extreme form of barnstorming, and wing walkers would constantly take up the challenge of outdoing one another. They themselves admitted (or rather proclaimed proudly) that the point of their trade was to make money on the audience's prospect of possibly watching someone die.\n\nAfter this initial demonstration, wing walkers continued to play an important part in the Army Air Corps (now the U.S. Air Force) and Navy in the advancement of aviation. They were instrumental in the first air-to-air refuelling, as well as long-distance flight records. In 1921, Wesley May strapped a fuel tank on his back and performed a plane-to-plane transfer. Additional tests were undertaken, and a hose with aid of a wing walker was the next exploration into aerial refuelling.\n\nOrmer Locklear led the charge with his plane-to-plane transfer, and many followed. His female equivalent, the first woman to switch planes in the air, was Ethal Dare.\n\nSome of the many aerialists to become popular were Tiny Broderick, Gladys Ingles, Eddie Angel, Virginia Angel, Mayme Carson, Clyde Pangborn, Lillian Boyer, Jack Shack, Al Wilson, Fronty Nichols, Spider Matlock, Gladys Roy, Ivan Unger, Jessie Woods, Bonnie Rowe, Charles Lindbergh, and Mabel Cody (niece of Buffalo Bill Cody).\n\nEight wing walkers died in a relatively short period during the infancy of wing walking and even the great Ormer Locklear himself perished in 1920 while performing a stunt for a film.\nVariations on wing walking became common, with such stunts as doing handstands, hanging by one's teeth, and transferring from one plane to another. A 1931 article on wing-walking on inverted aircraft touted the practical aspect of performing inflight landing-gear inspection or maintenance. Eventually wing walkers began making transfers between a ground vehicle, such as a car, a boat, or a train, to the plane. Other variations included free-falls ending with a last-minute parachute opening.\n\nCharles Lindbergh, whose career in flight began with wing walking, was well known for stunts involving parachutes.\nThe first African-American woman granted an international pilot license, Bessie Coleman, also engaged in stunts using parachutes. Another successful woman in this profession was Lillian Boyer, who performed hundreds of wing-walking exhibitions, automobile-to-plane changes, and parachute jumps.\n\nThen 18-year-old Elrey Borge Jeppesen, best known today for later having developed air navigation manuals and charts, joined Tex Rankin's Flying Circus around 1925; one of his jobs was wing walking.\n\nFlying circuses formed and they featured a variety of stunt performers. Promoters would herald the way with posters hyping up the danger of air walking and the new celebrities that would perform.\n\nSome famous early flying circuses or troops were The Gates Flying Circus, the Flying Aces Air Circus (Jimmy and Jessie Woods), The 13 Black Cats, The Five Blackbirds (an all African-American team), Mabel Cody's Flying Circus, Bugs McGowen's Flying Circus, and a troop run by Douglas Davis.\n\nThe Gates Flying Circus is perhaps the organization that made the most impression on the public. In one day alone, they gave 980 rides. This was done by pilot Bill Brooks at the Steubenville Air show in Ohio. Their one dollar joy ride was a sensation.\n\nWhen the stock market crash of 1929 occurred, many of the more prominent flying circuses such as The Gates Flying Circus folded. Smaller operations, such as the Flying Aces, with Jimmy and Jessie Woods, continued until the 1938 Air Commerce Act required them to wear a parachute.\nIn the 1970s, stunt men and women still had some restrictions. They had to be attached to the upper wing center section.\n\nIn the mid 1970s, Ron David, a pilot and gifted narrator, became the director of the Flying Circus in Bealeton, Virginia. Under his stewardship he returned the air show back to its barnstorming roots and included a wing-walking act. Since the Flying Circus aerodrome was a grass field, he asked the CAA to allow the wing walker out of cockpit during flight and return into the cockpit, so the wing walker could be strapped in for takeoff and landing. His concern was taking off or landing with a wing rider on the top wing and the chance of the plane flipping over if it hit a rut in the grass field. He was granted permission.\n\nHis first wing walker was Bill FitzSimons, a jumper with the Flying Circus. Bill left to continue his act around the country with pilot Ron Shelley. Jim Bradley, Bill's understudy, stepped in. Jim was a member of the Saint Michael's Angels there in the Flying Circus Aerodrome in Bealeton, Virginia. Jim tested and developed the fundamentals of their act.\n\nWhen his Army duty called him, he chose Hank Henry to continue wing walking with Ron. Hank wing walked a year and Ron advertised for a new wing walker. Nour Jorgensen responded to the ad. Jim Bradley, Hank Henry, and Nour Jurgenson busted the boundaries of wing walking. The stunt work they pioneered is still state of the art and continues to inspire wing walkers around the world.\n\nOn November 14, 1981, in an event organized by Martin Caidin, 19 skydivers set an unofficial wing-walking world record by standing on the left wing of a Junkers JU-52 aircraft in flight.\n\nOn October 20, 2018, Canadian rapper Jon \"Jon James\" McMurray died while attempting to wing walk, while filming a music video. McMurray fell off the wing too close to the ground to deploy his back up parachute.\n\nA wing walker, played by Susan Sarandon, falls to her death in the film \"The Great Waldo Pepper\" (1975).\n\nSonic the Hedgehog is frequently depicted Wing Walking on his plane, the Tornado, with Miles Tails Prower as his pilot.\n\n\n"}
