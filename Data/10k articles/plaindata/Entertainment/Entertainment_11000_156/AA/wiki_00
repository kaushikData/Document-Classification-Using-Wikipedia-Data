{"id": "2101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2101", "title": "Asterix", "text": "Asterix\n\nAsterix or The Adventures of Asterix ( or \"Astérix le Gaulois\" ) is a series of French comics. The series first appeared in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \"Pilote\" on 29 October 1959. It was written by René Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo until the death of Goscinny in 1977. Uderzo then took over the writing until 2009, when he sold the rights to publishing company Hachette. In 2013, a new team consisting of Jean-Yves Ferri (script) and Didier Conrad (artwork) took over. As of 2017, 37 volumes have been released.\n\nThe series follows the adventures of a village of Gauls as they resist Roman occupation in 50 BC. They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their druid Panoramix (named Getafix in the English translations), which temporarily gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonists, the title character Asterix and his friend Obelix, have various adventures. The \"ix\" ending of both names (as well as all the other pseudo-Gaulish \"ix\" names in the series) alludes to the \"rix\" suffix (meaning \"king\") present in the names of many real Gaulish chieftains such as Vercingetorix, Orgetorix and Dumnorix. In many of the stories, they travel to foreign countries, though others are set in and around their village. For much of the history of the series (Volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternated, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village.\n\nThe \"Asterix\" series is one of the most popular Franco-Belgian comics in the world, with the series being translated into 111 languages and dialects.\n\nThe success of the series has led to the adaptation of its books into 13 films: nine animated, and four live action (one of which, \"\", was a major box office success in France). There have also been a number of games based on the characters, and a theme park near Paris, Parc Astérix. The very first French satellite, Astérix, launched in 1965, was also named after the comics character. As of 2017, 370million copies of \"Asterix\" books have been sold worldwide, with co-creators René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo being France's best-selling authors abroad.\n\nPrior to creating the \"Asterix\" series, Goscinny and Uderzo had previously had success with their series \"Oumpah-pah\", which was published in \"Tintin\" magazine.\n\"Astérix\" was originally serialised in \"Pilote\" magazine, debuting in the first issue on 29 October 1959. In 1961 the first book was put together, titled \"Asterix the Gaul\". From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis. Their success was exponential; the first book sold 6,000 copies in its year of publication; a year later, the second sold 20,000. In 1963, the third sold 40,000; the fourth, released in 1964, sold 150,000. A year later, the fifth sold 300,000; 1966's \"Asterix and the Big Fight\" sold 400,000 upon initial publication. The ninth \"Asterix\" volume, when first released in 1967, sold 1.2 million copies in two days.\n\nUderzo's first sketches portrayed Asterix as a huge and strong traditional Gaulish warrior. But Goscinny had a different picture in his mind. He visualized Asterix as a shrewd small sized warrior who would prefer intelligence over strength. However, Uderzo felt that the small sized hero needed a strong but dim companion to which Goscinny agreed. Hence, Obelix was born. Despite the growing popularity of \"Asterix\" with the readers, the financial backing for \"Pilote\" ceased. \"Pilote\" was taken over by Georges Dargaud.\n\nWhen Goscinny died in 1977, Uderzo continued the series alone on the demand of the readers who implored him to continue. He continued the series but on a less frequent basis. Most critics and fans of the series prefer Goscinny's albums. Uderzo created his own publishing company, Les Editions Albert-René, which published every album drawn and written by Uderzo alone since then. However, Dargaud, the initial publisher of the series, kept the publishing rights on the 24 first albums made by both Uderzo and Goscinny. In 1990, the Uderzo and Goscinny families decided to sue Dargaud to take over the rights. In 1998, after a long trial, Dargaud lost the rights to publish and sell the albums. Uderzo decided to sell these rights to Hachette instead of Albert-René, but the publishing rights on new albums were still owned by Albert Uderzo (40%), Sylvie Uderzo (20%) and Anne Goscinny (40%).\n\nIn December 2008, Uderzo sold his stake to Hachette, which took over the company. In a letter published in the French newspaper \"Le Monde\" in 2009, Uderzo's daughter, Sylvie, attacked her father's decision to sell the family publishing firm and the rights to produce new \"Astérix\" adventures after his death. She said:\n\n[…] the co-creator of \"Astérix\", France’s comic strip hero, has betrayed the Gaulish warrior to the modern-day Romans – the men of industry and finance.\n\nHowever, René Goscinny's daughter, Anne, also gave her agreement to the continuation of the series and sold her rights at the same time. She is reported to have said that \"\"Asterix\" has already had two lives: one during my father's lifetime and one after it. Why not a third?\". A few months later, Uderzo appointed three illustrators, who had been his assistants for many years, to continue the series. In 2011, Uderzo announced that a new \"Asterix\" album was due out in 2013, with Jean-Yves Ferri writing the story and Frédéric Mébarki drawing it. A year later, in 2012, the publisher Albert-René announced that Frédéric Mébarki had withdrawn from drawing the new album, due to the pressure he felt in following in the steps of Uderzo. Comic artist Didier Conrad was officially announced to take over drawing duties from Mébarki, with the due date of the new album in 2013 unchanged.\n\nIn January 2015, after the murders of seven cartoonists at the satirical Paris weekly \"Charlie Hebdo\", \"Astérix\" creator Albert Uderzo came out of retirement to draw two \"Astérix\" pictures honouring the memories of the victims.\n\nNumbers 1–24, 32 and 34 are by Goscinny and Uderzo. Numbers 25–31 and 33 are by Uderzo alone. Years stated are for their initial album release. Numbers 35–37 are by Jean-Yves Ferri and Didier Conrad.\n\n\n\"Asterix Conquers Rome\" is a comics adaptation of the animated film \"The Twelve Tasks of Asterix\". It was released in 1976, and was the 23rd volume to be published, but it has been rarely reprinted and is not considered to be canonical to the series. The only English translations ever to be published were in the \"Asterix Annual 1980\" and never an English standalone volume. A picture-book version of the same story was published in English translation as \"The Twelve Tasks of Asterix\" by Hodder & Stoughton in 1978.\n\nIn 1996, a tribute album in honour of Albert Uderzo was released titled \"Uderzo Croqué par ses Amis\", a volume containing 21 short stories with Uderzo in Ancient Gaul. This volume was published by Soleil Productions and has not been translated into English\n\nIn 2007, Les Editions Albert René released a tribute volume titled \"Astérix et ses Amis\", a 60-page volume of one-to-four-page short stories. It was a tribute to Albert Uderzo on his 80th birthday by 34 European cartoonists. The volume was translated into nine languages. , it has not been translated into English.\n\nIn 2016, the publisher French Hachette along with Anne Goscinny and Albert Uderzo decided to make the special issue album \"The XII Tasks of Asterix\" for the 40th anniversary of the film \"The Twelve Tasks of Asterix\".\n\nThe main setting for the series is an unnamed coastal village (rumoured to be inspired by Erquy) in Armorica (present-day Brittany), a province of Gaul (modern France), in the year 50 BC. Julius Caesar has conquered nearly all of Gaul for the Roman Republic. The little Armorican village, however, has held out because the villagers can gain temporary superhuman strength by drinking a magic potion brewed by the local village druid, Getafix. His chief is Vitalstatistix.\n\nThe main protagonist and hero of the village is Asterix, who, because of his shrewdness, is usually entrusted with the most important affairs of the village. He is aided in his adventures by his rather fat and slower thinking friend, Obelix, who, because he fell into the druid's cauldron of the potion as a baby, has permanent superhuman strength (because of this, Getafix steadily refuses to allow Obelix to drink the potion, as doing so would have a dangerous and unpredictable result). Obelix is usually accompanied by Dogmatix, his little dog. (Except for Asterix and Obelix, the names of the characters change with the language. For example, Obelix's dog's name is \"Dogmatix\" in English, but \"Idéfix\" in the original French edition.)\n\nAsterix and Obelix (and sometimes other members of the village) go on various adventures both within the village and in far away lands. Places visited in the series include parts of Gaul (Lutetia, Corsica etc.), neighbouring nations (Belgium, Spain, Britain, Germany etc.), and far away lands (North America, Middle East, India etc.).\n\nThe series employs science-fiction and fantasy elements in the more recent books; for instance, the use of extraterrestrials in \"Asterix and the Falling Sky\" and the city of Atlantis in \"Asterix and Obelix All at Sea\".\n\nThe humour encountered in the \"Asterix\" comics often centers around puns, caricatures, and tongue-in-cheek stereotypes of contemporary European nations and French regions. Much of the humour in the initial Asterix books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the books into other languages for fear of losing the jokes and the spirit of the story. Some translations have actually added local humour: In the Italian translation, the Roman legionaries are made to speak in 20th century Roman dialect and Obelix's famous \"Ils sont fous ces romains\" (\"These Romans are crazy\") is translated as \"Sono pazzi questi romani\", alluding to the Roman abbreviation \"SPQR\". In another example: Hiccups are written onomatopoeically in French as \"hips\", but in English as \"hic\", allowing Roman legionaries in at least one of the English translations to decline their hiccups in Latin (\"hic, haec, hoc\"). The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual.\n\nAll the fictional characters in \"Asterix\" have names which are puns on their roles or personalities and which follow certain patterns specific to nationality. Certain rules are followed (most of the time) such as Gauls (and their neighbours) having an '-ix' suffix for the males and ending in '-a' for the females, for example, Chief Vitalstatistix (so called due to his portly stature) and his wife Impedimenta (often at odds with the chief). The male Roman names end in '-us', echoing Latin nominitive male singular form, as in Gluteus Maximus, a muscle-bound athlete whose name is literally the butt of the joke. Gothic names (present-day Germany) end in \"-ic\", after Gothic chiefs such as Alaric and Theoderic, for example Rhetoric the interpreter. Greek names end in \"-os\" or \"-es\"; for example, Thermos the restaurateur. British names end in \"-ax\" and are often puns on the taxation associated with the later United Kingdom, such as Valuaddedtax the druid and Selectivemploymentax the mercenary. Other nationalities are treated to Pidgin translations from their language, like Huevos y Bacon, a Spanish chieftain (whose name, meaning eggs and bacon, is often guidebook Spanish for tourists) or literary and other popular media references, like Dubbelosix (a reference to James Bond's codename 007).\n\nMost of these jokes, and hence the names of the characters, are specific to the translation; for example, the druid Getafix is \"Panoramix\" in the original French and \"Miraculix\" in German. Even so, occasionally the wordplay has been preserved: Obelix's dog, known in the original French as \"Idéfix\" (from \"idée fixe\", a \"fixed idea\" or obsession), is called \"Dogmatix\" in English, which not only renders the original meaning strikingly closely (\"dogmatic\") but in fact adds another layer of wordplay with the syllable \"Dog-\" at the beginning of the name.\n\nThe name \"Asterix\", French \"Astérix\", comes from ', meaning \"asterisk\", which is the typographical symbol *\"' indicating a footnote, from the Greek word αστήρ (\"aster\"), meaning a \"star\". His name is usually left unchanged in translations, aside from accents and the use of local alphabets. For example, in Esperanto, Polish, Slovene, Latvian, and Turkish it is \"Asteriks\" (in Turkish he was first named \"Bücür\" meaning \"shorty\", but the name was then changed). Two exceptions include Icelandic, in which he is known as \"Ástríkur\" (\"Rich of love\") and Sinhalese, where he is known as සූර පප්පා (\"Soora Pappa\"), which can be interpreted as \"Hero\".\n\nFor explanations of some of the other names, see List of \"Asterix\" characters.\n\nMany of the Asterix adventures take place in other countries aside from their homeland, Gaul. In every album that takes place abroad, they meet (usually modern-day) stereotypes for each country as seen by the French.\n\n\nWhen the Gauls see foreigners speaking their foreign languages, these have different representation in the speech bubbles:\n\n\nThe various volumes have been translated into more than 100 languages and dialects. Besides the original French language, most albums are available in Estonian, English, Czech, Dutch, German, Galician, Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Portuguese, Italian, modern Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Turkish, Slovene, Bulgarian, Serbian, Croatian, Latvian, Welsh as well as Latin.\n\nSome albums have also been translated into languages such as Esperanto, Scottish Gaelic, Irish, Scots, Indonesian, Persian, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Bengali, Afrikaans, Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew, Frisian, Romansch, Vietnamese, Sinhalese, Ancient Greek and Luxembourgish.\n\nIn France, Finland, and especially in Germany, several volumes were translated into a variety of regional languages and dialects, such as Alsatian, Breton, Chtimi (Picard) and Corsican in France, Bavarian, Swabian and Low German in Germany, and Savo, Karelia, Rauma and Helsinki slang dialects in Finland. Also, in Portugal, a special edition of the first volume, Asterix the Gaul, was translated into local language Mirandese. In Greece, a number of volumes have appeared in the Cretan Greek, Cypriot Greek and Pontic Greek dialects. In the Italian version, while the Gauls speak standard Italian, the legionaries speak in the Romanesque dialect. In the former Yugoslavia, the \"Forum\" publishing house translated Corsican text in \"Asterix in Corsica\" into the Montenegrin dialect of Serbo-Croatian (today called Montenegrin).\n\nIn the Netherlands several volumes were translated into West Frisian, a Germanic language spoken in the province of Friesland, into Limburgish, a regional language spoken not only in Dutch Limburg but also in Belgian Limburg and North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany and into Tweants, a dialect in the region of Twente in the eastern province of Overijssel. Hungarian-language books have been published in Yugoslavia for the Hungarian minority living in Serbia. Although not a fully autonomous dialect, the books differ slightly from the language of the books issued in Hungary. In Sri Lanka, the cartoon series was adapted into Sinhala (\"Singhalese\") as \"Sura Pappa\".\n\nMost volumes have been translated into Latin and Ancient Greek with accompanying teachers' guides as a way of teaching these ancient languages.\n\nBefore Asterix became famous, translations of some strips were published in British comics including \"Valiant\", \"Ranger\", and \"Look & Learn\", under names \"Little Fred and Big Ed\" and \"Beric the Bold\", set in Roman-occupied Britain. These were included in an exhibition on Goscinny's life and career, and Asterix, in London's Jewish Museum in 2018.\n\nThe translation of the books into English has been done by Derek Hockridge and Anthea Bell, and their English language rendition has been widely praised for maintaining the spirit and humour of the original French version. Derek Hockridge died in 2013 and Anthea Bell retired in 2016 for health reasons. Bell died in 2018. Adriana Hunter is the present translator.\n\nThe series has been adapted into various media. There are 14 films, 15 board games, 40 video games, and 1 theme park.\n\nVarious motion pictures based upon the series have been made.\n\n\nMany gamebooks, board games and video games are based upon the \"Asterix\" series. In particular, many video games were released by various computer game publishers.\n\nParc Astérix, a theme park 22 miles north of Paris, based upon the series, was opened in 1989. It is one of the most visited sites in France, with around 1.6 million visitors per year.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "696946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=696946", "title": "Audience", "text": "Audience\n\nAn audience is a group of people who participate in a show or encounter a work of art, literature (in which they are called \"readers\"), theatre, music (in which they are called \"listeners\"), video games (in which they are called \"players\"), or academics in any medium. Audience members participate in different ways in different kinds of art; some events invite overt audience participation and others allowing only modest clapping and criticism and reception.\n\nMedia audience studies have become a recognized part of the curriculum. Audience theory offers scholarly insight into audiences in general. These insights shape our knowledge of just how audiences affect and are affected by different forms of art. The biggest art form is the mass media. Films, video games, radio shows, software (and hardware), and other formats are affected by the audience and its reviews and recommendations.\n\nIn the age of easy internet participation and citizen journalism, professional creators share space, and sometimes attention with the public. American journalist Jeff Jarvis said, \"Give the people control of media, they will use it. The corollary: Don't give the people control of media, and you will lose. Whenever citizens can exercise control, they will.\" Tom Curley, President of the Associated Press, similarly said, \"The users are deciding what the point of their engagement will be — what application, what device, what time, what place.\"\n\nIn rhetoric, some audiences depend on circumstance and situation, and are characterized by the individuals that make up the audience. Sometimes these audiences are subject to persuasion and engage with the ideas of the speaker. Ranging in size and composition, this audience may come together and form a \"composite\" of multiple groups.\n\nAn immediate audience is a type of audience that is composed of individuals who are face-to-face subjects with a speaker and a speaker's rhetorical text or speech. This audience directly listens to, engages with, and consumes the rhetorical text in an unmediated fashion. In measuring immediate audience reception and feedback, (audience measurement), one can depend on personal interviews, applause, and verbal comments made during and after a rhetorical speech.\n\nIn contrast to immediate audiences, mediated audiences are composed of individuals who consume rhetorical texts in a manner that is different from the time or place in which a speaker presents text. Audiences who consume texts or speeches through television, radio and internet are considered mediated audiences because those mediums separate the rhetor and the audience. Such audiences are physically away from the audience and the message is controlled. Understanding the size and composition of mediated audiences can be difficult because mediums such as television, radio, and Internet can displace the audience from the time and circumstance of a rhetorical text or speech. In measuring mediated audience reception and feedback (a practice called audience measurement), one can depend on opinion polls and ratings, as well as comments and forums that may be featured on a website. This applies to may fields such as movies, songs and much more. There are companies that specialise in audience measurement. \n\nTheoretical audiences are imagined for the purpose of helping a speaker compose, practice, or a critic to understand, a rhetorical text or speech.\n\nWhen a rhetor deeply considers, questions, and deliberates over the content of the ideas they are conveying, it can be said that these individuals are addressing the audience of self, or self-deliberating. Scholars Chaim Perelman and L. Olbrechts-Tyteca, in their book \"The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation\", argue that the rhetor \"is in a better position than anyone else to test the value of his own arguments.\" The audience of self, while not serving as the ends to all rhetorical purpose or circumstance, nevertheless acts as a type of audience that not only operates as a function of self-help, but as instrument used to discover the available means of persuasion.\n\nThe universal audience is an imagined audience that serves as an ethical and argumentative test for the rhetor. This also requires the speaker to imagine a composite audience that contains individuals from diverse backgrounds and to discern whether or not the content of the rhetorical text or speech would appeal to individuals within that audience. Scholars Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca ascertain that the content addressed to a universal audience \"must convince the reader that the reasons adduced are of a compelling character, that they are self-evident, and possess an absolute and timeless validity\". The concept of the universal audience has received criticism for being idealistic because it can be considered as an impediment in achieving persuasive effect with particular audiences. Yet, it still may be useful as an ethical guide for a speaker and a critical tool for a reader or audience.\n\nAn ideal audience is a rhetor's imagined, intended audience. In creating a rhetorical text, a rhetor imagines is the target audience, a group of individuals that will be addressed, persuaded, or affected by the speech or rhetorical text. This type of audience is not necessarily imagined as the most receptive audience, but as the future particular audience that the rhetor will engage with. Imagining such an audience allows a rhetor to formulate appeals that will grant success in engaging with the future particular audience. In considering an ideal audience, a rhetor can imagine future conditions of mediation, size, demographics, and shared beliefs among the audience to be persuaded.\n\nAn implied audience is an imaginary audience determined by an auditor or reader as the text's constructed audience. The implied audience is not the actual audience, but the one that can be inferred by reading or analyzing the text. Communications scholar Edwin Black, in his essay, The Second Persona, presents the theoretical concept of the implied audience using the idea of two personae. The first persona is the implied rhetoric (the idea of the speaker formed by the audience) and the second persona is the implied audience (the idea of the audience formed by and utilized for persuasion in the speech situation). A critic could also determine what the text wants that audience to become or do after the rhetorical situation.\n\nThrough the Internet, every person is given the opportunity to participate in different ways. The Internet gives people a platform to write and reach the people who are interested in what they are writing about. When writers write online, they are able to form communities with the people they share common interests with. The audiences that people are trying to reach can be general or specific, all depending on what the writer is discussing in their online posts. Audiences have to go and check into what the writers are writing to stay on top of the latest information. Writers have to find their niche and try hard to work their way into an already formed community. The audience the writer is reaching is able to respond to the writers posts and can give feedback. The Internet allows these connections to be formed and fostered. In the \"Here Comes Everybody\" book by Clay Shirky, there are various examples of how audience is not only receiving content but actually creating it. Internet creates a chance of being part of an audience and a creator at the same time.\n\nAudience participation is commonly found in performances which break the fourth wall. Examples include the traditional British pantomimes, stand-up comedy, and creative stage shows such as Blue Man Group.\n\nAudience participation can be uncomfortable for certain people, but is growing and evolving as a new tool of brand activation and brand engagement. In a bid to create and reinforce a special bond between brands and their consumers, companies are increasingly looking towards events that involve active audience participation. Often, organizations provide branded objects to event attendees that will involve the audience in the show as well as act as souvenirs of the event, creating a lasting link with the brand. For example, during Super Bowl XLVIII, the audience was incorporated in the Super Bowl XLVIII Halftime Show as part of the lighting effects. Pepsi involved the spectators by giving them \"video ski hats\" that produced visual effects across the crowd.\nBy appealing more directly to people and emotions, brands can obtain feedback from their consumers. Companies that provide or seek such experiences refer to the term \"crowd activation\". For example, Tangible Interaction named one of its branches Crowd Activation and PixMob refers to itself as a crowd activation company on its website.\n\nOne of the most well-known examples of popular audience participation accompanies the motion picture and music \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" and its earlier stage incarnation \"The Rocky Horror Show\". The audience participation elements are often seen as the most important part of the picture, to the extent that the audio options on the DVD version include the option.\n\nIn the audience participation for the Rocky Horror Picture Show, the audience will make \"call backs\", and yell at the screen at certain parts of the movie. Also, a number of props are thrown and used by the audience during certain parts of the film. \n\nIn British pantomime performances, the audience is a crucial aspect of the show and is expected to perform certain tasks such as:\n\n\"The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)\" divides the audience into groups assigned to call out the concerns of three components of a character's psyche. \n\nIn \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\", a Broadway theatre musical based on Charles Dickens's last, unfinished work, the audience must vote for whom they think the murderer is, as well as the real identity of the detective and the couple who end up together.\n\nThe 1984 Summer Olympics included card stunts at the Olympic Stadium. \n\nTony and Tina's Wedding engages the entire audience at once, staging a narrative set during a wedding in which the audience performs the role of \"guests\".\n\nThe British panel game \"QI\" often allows the audience to try to answer questions. Currently, the audience have won one show, and have come last in another.\n\nMagic shows often rely on some audience participation. Psychological illusionist Derren Brown relies heavily on audience participation in his live shows.\n\nDuring performances of the Radetzky March, it is traditional for the audience to clap along with the beat of the second (louder) repetitions of the chorus. This is particularly notable at the Neujahrskonzert.\n\nBloggers often allow their readers moderated or unmoderated comments sections.\n\nSome musical groups often heavily incorporate audience participation into their live shows. The superhero-themed comedy rock band The Aquabats typically do so within their theatrical stage shows through such antics as \"pool floatie races\", where members of the band race across the venue on inflatable rafts via crowd surfing, or providing the audience with projectiles (such as plastic balls or beach balls) to throw at costumed \"bad guys\" who come out on stage. Koo Koo Kanga Roo, a comedy dance-pop duo, write their music solely for audience participation, utilizing call and response style sing-along songs which are usually accompanied by a simple dance move that the band encourage the audience to follow along with.\n\nThe television series \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" featured a man and his robots who were held as imprisoned audience members and tortured by being forced to view \"bad\" movies; to retain their sanity, they talked throughout and heckled each one.\n\nIn a similar vein, the online site Television Without Pity has a stable of reviewers and recappers who speak the lingo of audience members rather than of scholars, and who sometimes act as though they, too, are being tortured. \n\n"}

{"id": "164328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164328", "title": "Barbie", "text": "Barbie\n\nBarbie is a fashion doll manufactured by the American toy company Mattel, Inc. and launched in March 1959. American businesswoman Ruth Handler is credited with the creation of the doll using a German doll called Bild Lilli as her inspiration.\n\nBarbie is the figurehead of a brand of Mattel dolls and accessories, including other family members and collectible dolls. Barbie has been an important part of the toy fashion doll market for over fifty years, and has been the subject of numerous controversies and lawsuits, often involving parodies of the doll and her lifestyle.\n\nMattel has sold over a billion Barbie dolls, making it the company’s largest and most profitable line. However, sales have declined sharply since 2014. The doll transformed the toy business in affluent communities worldwide by becoming a vehicle for the sale of related merchandise (accessories, clothes, friends of Barbie, etc.). She had a significant impact on social values by conveying characteristics of female independence, and with her multitude of accessories, an idealized upscale life-style that can be shared with affluent friends. Starting in 1987, Barbie has expanded into a media franchise, including animated films, television specials, , and music.\n\nRuth Handler watched her daughter Barbara play with paper dolls, and noticed that she often enjoyed giving them adult roles. At the time, most children's toy dolls were representations of infants. Realizing that there could be a gap in the market, Handler suggested the idea of an adult-bodied doll to her husband Elliot, a co-founder of the Mattel toy company. He was unenthusiastic about the idea, as were Mattel's directors.\n\nDuring a trip to Europe in 1956 with her children Barbara and Kenneth, Ruth Handler came across a German toy doll called Bild Lilli. The adult-figured doll was exactly what Handler had in mind, so she purchased three of them. She gave one to her daughter and took the others back to Mattel. The Lilli doll was based on a popular character appearing in a comic strip drawn by Reinhard Beuthin for the newspaper \"Bild\". Lilli was a blonde bombshell, a working girl who knew what she wanted and was not above using men to get it. The Lilli doll was first sold in Germany in 1955, and although it was initially sold to adults, it became popular with children who enjoyed dressing her up in outfits that were available separately.\n\nUpon her return to the United States, Handler redesigned the doll (with help from engineer Jack Ryan) and the doll was given a new name, \"Barbie\", after Handler's daughter Barbara. The doll made its debut at the American International Toy Fair in New York on March 9, 1959. This date is also used as Barbie's official birthday.\n\nThe first Barbie doll wore a black and white zebra striped swimsuit and signature topknot ponytail, and was available as either a blonde or brunette. The doll was marketed as a \"Teen-age Fashion Model,\" with her clothes created by Mattel fashion designer Charlotte Johnson. The first Barbie dolls were manufactured in Japan, with their clothes hand-stitched by Japanese homeworkers. Around 350,000 Barbie dolls were sold during the first year of production.\n\nLouis Marx and Company sued Mattel in March 1961. After licensing Lilli, they claimed that Mattel had “infringed on Greiner & Hausser's patent for Bild-Lilli’s hip joint, and also claimed that Barbie was \"a direct take-off and copy\" of Bild-Lilli. The company additionally claimed that Mattel \"falsely and misleadingly represented itself as having originated the design\". Mattel counter-claimed and the case was settled out of court in 1963. In 1964, Mattel bought Greiner & Hausser's copyright and patent rights for the Bild-Lilli doll for $21,600.\n\nRuth Handler believed that it was important for Barbie to have an adult appearance, and early market research showed that some parents were unhappy about the doll's chest, which had distinct breasts. Barbie's appearance has been changed many times, most notably in 1971 when the doll's eyes were adjusted to look forwards rather than having the demure sideways glance of the original model.\n\nBarbie was one of the first toys to have a marketing strategy based extensively on television advertising, which has been copied widely by other toys. It is estimated that over a billion Barbie dolls have been sold worldwide in over 150 countries, with Mattel claiming that three Barbie dolls are sold every second.\n\nThe standard range of Barbie dolls and related accessories are manufactured to approximately , which is also known as \"playscale\". The standard dolls are approximately 11½ inches tall.\n\nBarbie products include not only the range of dolls with their clothes and accessories, but also a large range of Barbie branded goods such as books, apparel, cosmetics, and . Barbie has had a media franchise starting in 1987, when she began appearing in a series of animated films.\n\nBarbie's direct-to-DVD animated films have sold more than units worldwide, as of 2006. In addition, the brand has had two television specials, \"\" and \"\", as well as a hit song, \"Barbie Girl\" (1997) by Aqua. She is also a supporting character in the Pixar films \"Toy Story 2\" and \"Toy Story 3\".\n\nBarbie has become a cultural icon and has been given honors that are rare in the toy world. In 1974, a section of Times Square in New York City was renamed Barbie Boulevard for a week. The Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris at the Louvre held a Barbie exhibit in 2016. The exhibit featured 700 Barbie dolls over two floors as well as works by contemporary artists and documents (newspapers, photos, video) that contextualize Barbie.\n\nIn 1986, the artist Andy Warhol created a painting of Barbie. The painting sold at auction at Christie’s, London for $1.1 million. In 2015, The Andy Warhol Foundation then teamed up with Mattel to create an Andy Warhol Barbie.\n\nOutsider artist Al Carbee took thousands of photographs of Barbie and created countless collages and dioramas featuring Barbie in various settings. Carbee was the subject of the feature-length documentary Magical Universe. Carbee's collage art was presented in the 2016 Barbie exhibit at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris in the section about visuals artists who have been inspired by Barbie.\n\nIn 2013, in Taiwan, the first Barbie-themed restaurant called \"Barbie Café\" opened under the Sinlaku group.\n\nThe \"Economist\" has emphasized the importance of Barbie to children's imagination:\n\nIn 2009, Barbie celebrated her 50th birthday. The celebrations included a runway show in New York for the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. The event showcased fashions contributed by fifty well-known haute couturiers including Diane von Fürstenberg, Vera Wang, Calvin Klein, Bob Mackie, and Christian Louboutin.\n\nBarbie's full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts. In a series of novels published by Random House in the 1960s, her parents' names are given as George and Margaret Roberts from the fictional town of Willows, Wisconsin. In the Random House novels, Barbie attended Willows High School; while in the \"Generation Girl\" books, published by Golden Books in 1999, she attended the fictional Manhattan International High School in New York City (based on the real-life Stuyvesant High School).\n\nShe has an on-off romantic relationship with her boyfriend Ken (\"Ken Carson\"), who first appeared in 1961. A news release from Mattel in February 2004 announced that Barbie and Ken had decided to split up, but in February 2006, they were hoping to rekindle their relationship after Ken had a makeover.\n\nBarbie has had over 40 pets including cats and dogs, horses, a panda, a lion cub, and a zebra. She has owned a wide range of vehicles, including pink Corvette convertibles, trailers, and Jeeps. She also holds a pilot's license, and operates commercial airliners in addition to serving as a flight attendant.\nBarbie's careers are designed to show that women can take on a variety of roles in life, and the doll has been sold with a wide range of titles including \"Miss Astronaut Barbie\" (1965), \"Doctor Barbie\" (1988), and \"Nascar Barbie\" (1998).\n\nMattel has created a range of companions for Barbie, including Hispanic Teresa, Midge, African American Christie, and Steven (Christie's boyfriend). Barbie's siblings and cousins were also created including Skipper, Todd and Stacie (twin brother and sister), Kelly, Krissy, and Francie. Barbie was friendly with Blaine, an Australian surfer, during her split with Ken in 2004.\n\nBody Image\n\nFrom the start, some have complained that \"the blonde, plastic doll conveyed an unrealistic body image to girls.\" \n\nCriticisms of Barbie are often centered around concerns that children consider Barbie a role model and will attempt to emulate her. One of the most common criticisms of Barbie is that she promotes an unrealistic idea of body image for a young woman, leading to a risk that girls who attempt to emulate her will become anorexic. A standard Barbie doll is 11.5 inches tall, giving a height of 5 feet 9 inches at . Barbie's vital statistics have been estimated at 36 inches (chest), 18 inches (waist) and 33 inches (hips). According to research by the University Central Hospital in Helsinki, Finland, she would lack the 17 to 22 percent body fat required for a woman to menstruate. In 1963, the outfit \"Barbie Baby-Sits\" came with a book entitled \"How to Lose Weight\" which advised: \"Don't eat!\". The same book was included in another ensemble called \"Slumber Party\" in 1965 along with a pink bathroom scale permanently set at 110 lbs., which would be around 35 lbs. underweight for a woman 5 feet 9 inches tall. Mattel said that the waist of the Barbie doll was made small because the waistbands of her clothes, along with their seams, snaps, and zippers, added bulk to her figure. In 1997, Barbie's body mold was redesigned and given a wider waist, with Mattel saying that this would make the doll better suited to contemporary fashion designs. In 2016, Mattel introduced a range of new body types: 'tall', 'petite', and 'curvy'. 'Curvy Barbie' received a great deal of media attention and even made the cover of Time magazine with the headline 'Now Can We Stop Talking About My Body?'. Despite the curvy doll's body shape being equivalent to a US size 4 in clothing, many children regard her as 'fat'.\n\nDiversity\n\nComplaints also point to a lack of diversity in the line. Mattel responded to these criticisms. Starting in 1980, it produced Hispanic dolls, and later came models from across the globe. For example, in 2007, it introduced \"Cinco de Mayo Barbie\" wearing a ruffled red, white, and green dress (echoing the Mexican flag). \"Hispanic\" magazine reports that:\n\"Colored Francie\" made her debut in 1967, and she is sometimes described as the first African American Barbie doll. However, she was produced using the existing head molds for the white Francie doll and lacked African characteristics other than a dark skin. The first African American doll in the Barbie range is usually regarded as Christie, who made her debut in 1968. Black Barbie was launched in 1980 but still had Caucasian features. In 1990, Mattel created a focus group with African American children and parents, early childhood specialists, and clinical psychologist, Darlene Powell Hudson. Instead of using the same molds for the Caucasian Barbies, new ones were created. In addition, facial features, skin tones, hair texture, and names were all altered. The body shapes looked different, but the proportions were the same to ensure clothing and accessories were interchangeable. In September 2009, Mattel introduced the So In Style range, which was intended to create a more realistic depiction of African American people than previous dolls. In 2016, Mattel expanded this line to include seven skin tones, twenty-two eye colors, and twenty-four hairstyles. Part of the reason for this change was due to declining sales. \n\nMattel teamed up with Nabisco to launch a cross-promotion of Barbie with Oreo cookies. \"Oreo Fun Barbie\" was marketed as someone with whom young girls could play after class and share \"America's favorite cookie.\" As had become the custom, Mattel manufactured both a white and a black version. Critics argued that in the African American community, \"Oreo\" is a derogatory term meaning that the person is \"black on the outside and white on the inside,\" like the chocolate sandwich cookie itself. The doll was unsuccessful and Mattel recalled the unsold stock, making it sought after by collectors.\n\nIn May 1997, Mattel introduced \"Share a Smile Becky\", a doll in a pink wheelchair. Kjersti Johnson, a 17-year-old high school student in Tacoma, Washington with cerebral palsy, pointed out that the doll would not fit into the elevator of Barbie's $100 Dream House. Mattel announced that it would redesign the house in the future to accommodate the doll. \n\nBad Influence Concerns\n\nIn July 1992, Mattel released \"Teen Talk Barbie\", which spoke a number of phrases including \"Will we ever have enough clothes?\", \"I love shopping!\", and \"Wanna have a pizza party?\" Each doll was programmed to say four out of 270 possible phrases, so that no two given dolls were likely to be the same. One of these 270 phrases was \"Math class is tough!\". Although only about 1.5% of all the dolls sold said the phrase, it led to criticism from the American Association of University Women. In October 1992, Mattel announced that \"Teen Talk Barbie\" would no longer say the phrase, and offered a swap to anyone who owned a doll that did.\n\nIn September 2003, the Middle Eastern country of Saudi Arabia outlawed the sale of Barbie dolls, saying that she did not conform to the ideals of Islam. The Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice stated \"Jewish Barbie dolls, with their revealing clothes and shameful postures, accessories and tools are a symbol of decadence to the perverted West. Let us beware of her dangers and be careful.\" In Middle Eastern countries, there is an alternative doll called Fulla, which is equivalent to Barbie but is designed specifically to accommodate an Islamic community. Fulla is not manufactured by the Mattel Corporation (although Mattel still licenses Fulla dolls and franchises for sale in some countries), and the \"Jewish\" Barbie dolls are still available in other Muslim-majority countries including Egypt. In Iran, Sara and Dara dolls, introduced in March 2002, are available as an alternative to Barbie, even though they have not been as successful as Barbie.\n\nIn April 2009, the launch of a \"Totally Tattoos Barbie\" with a range of tattoos that could be applied to the doll, including a lower-back tattoo, led to controversy. Mattel's promotional material read \"Customize the fashions and apply the fun temporary tattoos on you too\", but Ed Mayo, chief executive of Consumer Focus, argued that children might want to get tattooed themselves.\n\nIn November 2014, Mattel received criticism over the book \"I Can Be a Computer Engineer\", which depicted Barbie as being inept at computers and requiring that her two male friends complete all of the necessary tasks to restore two laptops after she downloads a virus onto both of them. Critics complained that the book was sexist, as other books in the \"I Can Be...\" series depicted Barbie as someone who was competent in those jobs and did not require outside assistance from others. Mattel later removed the book from sale on Amazon in response to the criticism.\n\nSafety Concerns\n\nIn March 2000, stories appeared in the media claiming that the hard vinyl used in vintage Barbie dolls could leak toxic chemicals, causing danger to children playing with them. The claim was described as an overreaction by Joseph Prohaska, a professor at the University of Minnesota Duluth. A modern Barbie doll has a body made from ABS plastic, while the head is made from soft PVC.\n\nIn July 2010, Mattel released \"Barbie Video Girl\", a Barbie doll with a pinhole video camera in its chest, enabling clips of up to 30 minutes to be recorded, viewed, and uploaded to a computer via a USB cable. On November 30, 2010, the FBI issued a warning in a private memo that the doll could be used to produce child pornography, although it stated publicly that there was \"no reported evidence that the doll had been used in any way other than intended.\"\n\nIn March 2015, concerns were raised about a version of the doll called \"Hello Barbie\", which can hold conversations with a child using speech recognition technology. The doll transmits data back to a service called ToyTalk, which according to \"Forbes\", has a terms of service and privacy policy that allow it to “share audio recordings with third party vendors who assist us with speech recognition,” and states that “recordings and photos may also be used for research and development purposes, such as to improve speech recognition technology and artificial intelligence algorithms and create better entertainment experiences.”\n\nBarbie has frequently been the target of parody: \n\n\nMattel estimates that there are well over 100,000 avid Barbie collectors. Ninety percent are women, at an average age of 40, purchasing more than twenty Barbie dolls each year. Forty-five percent of them spend upwards of $1000 a year.\nVintage Barbie dolls from the early years are the most valuable at auction, and while the original Barbie was sold for $3.00 in 1959, a mint boxed Barbie from 1959 sold for $3552.50 on eBay in October 2004. On September 26, 2006, a Barbie doll set a world record at auction of £9,000 sterling (US $17,000) at Christie's in London. The doll was a Barbie in Midnight Red from 1965 and was part of a private collection of 4,000 Barbie dolls being sold by two Dutch women, Ietje Raebel and her daughter Marina.\n\nIn recent years, Mattel has sold a wide range of Barbie dolls aimed specifically at collectors, including porcelain versions, vintage reproductions, and depictions of Barbie as a range of characters from film and television series such as \"The Munsters\" and \"\". There are also collector's edition dolls depicting Barbie dolls with a range of different ethnic identities. In 2004, Mattel introduced the Color Tier system for its collector's edition Barbie dolls including pink, silver, gold, and platinum, depending on how many of the dolls are produced.\n\nIn March 2018, in time for International Women's Day, Mattel unveiled the \"Barbie Celebrates Role Models\" campaign with a line of 17 dolls, informally known as \"sheroes\", from diverse backgrounds \"to showcase examples of extraordinary women\". Mattel developed this collection in response to mothers concerned about their daughters having positive female role models. Dolls in this collection include Frida Kahlo, Patti Jenkins, Chloe Kim, Nicola Adams, Ibtihaj Muhammad, Bindi Irwin, Amelia Earhart, Misty Copeland, Helene Darroze, Katherine Johnson, Sara Gama, Martyna Wojciechowska, Gabby Douglas, Guan Xiaotong, Ava Duvernay, Yuan Yuan Tan, and Leyla Piedayesh.\n\nIn June 2001, MGA Entertainment launched the Bratz series of dolls, a move that gave Barbie her first serious competition in the fashion doll market. In 2004, sales figures showed that Bratz dolls were outselling Barbie dolls in the United Kingdom, although Mattel maintained that in terms of the number of dolls, clothes, and accessories sold, Barbie remained the leading brand. In 2005, figures showed that sales of Barbie dolls had fallen by 30% in the United States, and by 18% worldwide, with much of the drop being attributed to the popularity of Bratz dolls.\n\nIn December 2006, Mattel sued MGA Entertainment for $500 million, alleging that Bratz creator Carter Bryant was working for Mattel when he developed the idea for Bratz. On July 17, 2008, a federal jury agreed that the Bratz line was created by Carter Bryant while he was working for Mattel and that MGA and its Chief Executive Officer Isaac Larian were liable for converting Mattel property for their own use and intentionally interfering with the contractual duties owed by Bryant to Mattel. On August 26, the jury found that Mattel would have to be paid $100 million in damages. On December 3, 2008, U.S. District Judge Stephen Larson banned MGA from selling Bratz. He allowed the company to continue selling the dolls until the winter holiday season ended. On appeal, a stay was granted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; the Court also overturned the District Court's original ruling for Mattel, where MGA Entertainment was ordered to forfeit the entire Bratz brand.\n\nMattel Inc. and MGA Entertainment Inc. returned to court on January 18, 2011 to renew their battle over who owns Bratz, which this time includes accusations from both companies that the other side stole trade secrets. On April 21, 2011, a federal jury returned a verdict supporting MGA. On August 5, 2011, Mattel was also ordered to pay MGA $310 million for attorney fees, stealing trade secrets, and false claims rather than the $88.5 million issued in April.\n\nIn August 2009, MGA introduced a range of dolls called Moxie Girlz, intended as a replacement for Bratz dolls.\n\n\"Barbie syndrome\" is a term that has been used to depict the desire to have a physical appearance and lifestyle representative of the Barbie doll. It is most often associated with pre-teenage and adolescent females but is applicable to any age group or gender. A person with Barbie syndrome attempts to emulate the doll's physical appearance, even though the doll has unattainable body proportions. This syndrome is seen as a form of body dysmorphic disorder and results in various eating disorders as well as an obsession with cosmetic surgery.\n\nUkrainian model Valeria Lukyanova has received attention from the press, due in part to her appearance having been modified based on the physique of Barbie. She stated that she has only had breast implants and relies heavily on make up and contacts to alter her appearance. Similarly, Lacey Wildd, an American reality television personality frequently referred to as \"Million Dollar Barbie\" has also undergone 12 breast augmentation surgeries to become \"the extreme Barbie\".\n\nRodrigo Alves, the \"Human Ken Doll\", has undergone over £373,000 worth of cosmetic procedures to match the appearance of Barbie's male counterpart.These procedures have included multiple nose jobs, six pack ab implants, a buttock lift, and hair and chest implants. Sporting the same nickname, Justin Jedlica, the American businessman, has also received multiple cosmetic surgeries to enhance his Ken-like appearance.\n\nIn 2006, researchers Helga Dittmar, Emma Halliwell, and Suzanne Ive conducted an experiment testing how dolls, including Barbie, effect self-image in young girls. Dittmar, Halliwell, and Ive gave picture books to girls age 5–8, one with photos of Barbie and the other with photos of Emme, a doll with more realistic physical features. The girls were then asked about their ideal body size. Their research found that the girls who were exposed to the images of Barbie had significantly lower self-esteem than the girls who had photos of Emme.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3333214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3333214", "title": "Barrel of Monkeys", "text": "Barrel of Monkeys\n\nBarrel of Monkeys is a toy game released by Lakeside Toys in 1965. It was created by Leonard Marks and Milton Dinhofer in 1961, and in 1964, Herman Kesler partnered to sell it to Lakeside Toys. Lakeside Toys released it in 1965 and today it is produced by the Milton Bradley Company within the Hasbro corporation. Milton Bradley's editions consist of a toy barrel in either blue, yellow, red, purple, orange, gray or green. The barrel contains 12 monkeys but can hold 24, their color usually corresponding to the barrel's color. The instructions state, \"Dump monkeys onto table. Pick up one monkey by an arm. Hook other arm through a second monkey's arm. Continue making a chain. Your turn is over when a monkey is dropped.\" In addition to these basic instructions, the barrel also contains instructions for playing alone or with two or more players.\n\n\"Time\" magazine ranked \"Barrel of Monkeys\" at #53 on their 2011 \"All-Time 100 Greatest Toys\" list.\n\nIn 1961, a greeting cards salesman, Leonard Marks, was in a small mom-and-pop shop to sell his line of cards. As he waited for Robert Gilbert, the shop owner, he fiddled with an open box of snow tire replacement chain links. Marks was so interested in playing, he hadn’t realized so much time had passed. When he told Gilbert that the links would make a great toy, Gilbert referred Marks to a successful local toy inventor, Milton Dinhofer. Marks already knew Dinhofer from his high school days and immediately reached out to his old friend. Dinhofer asked Marks to bring him a plastic sample of the hooks to their meeting.\n\nAt the time, Milton Dinhofer was a graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a successful importer. Prior to meeting with Marks, Dinhofer already had two major toy achievements to his credit. He created the first full-size wearable toy space helmet. The helmet made the covers of both \"The Saturday Evening Post\" (November 8, 1952) and \"Collier’s\" magazine (April 18, 1953). He also designed and brought to market Sip-n-See. Sip-n-See was the first plastic drinking straw on the market and the first twisted straw, selling over 5 million pieces. The straws had different characters on them, and it was the cowboy character’s s-shaped arms that would inspire the shape of the monkeys.\n\nWhen Marks met Dinhofer at his home in Roslyn, New York, he brought a pile of red s-shaped 1/4” rod plastic hooks. Dinhofer immediately imagined monkeys and envisioned them with arms like those on his cowboy straw. Marks and Dinhofer agreed to form a partnership that night. It was decided that Dinhofer would design the toy, and Marks would sell it. It then took Dinhofer three months to go from sketch to functional monkey. He made a sketch for a face and one for a body. The biggest challenge was the monkeys' balance. Once that was achieved, Dinhofer hired A. Santore of A. S. Plastic Model Company to carve a sample under his supervision. Dinhofer took Santore's sample to a company that could make a beryllium mold of it. Finding a mold maker was quite a challenge and very expensive, as working with plastic was still relatively new. The initial run of monkeys were in many assorted colors, but their shape was just like those that Lakeside would release in 1965. (Lakeside would eventually add a little more hair to the bodies.) Marks and Dinhofer named their game Chimp to Chimp and chose three colors for their monkeys - four were yellow, four were green and four were red. Twelve total monkeys allowed three to twelve year old children to link them without needing to stand on stools. The Chimp to Chimp prototype came in a flat expensive-to-make packaging, which the Woolworth chain offered to carry in their stores. Woolworths stipulated that Marks and Dinhofer must provide 13 weeks of television advertising. Neither Dinhofer nor Marks could afford a television advertising campaign, and there were no other buyers found. It seemed the game would never come to market. Then in 1964, Herman Kesler agreed to join the partnership and pitch Barrel of Monkeys to Lakeside Toys where he had connections.\n\nIn 1964, Kesler called Zelman Levine, the CEO and President of Lakeside Toys for a meeting. They met in November of that year at the Essex House New York City. Also present were Lakeside's vice president, James R. Becker, who would eventually become president, and Stanley Harfenist, Lakeside’s future General Manager who was in the process of bringing Gumby to Lakeside. Kesler walked into Levine’s room, dropped the monkeys on the table, and began to link them together. Becker said the phrase, “more fun than a barrel of monkeys” was brought up at that meeting by Becker himself. Levine immediately approved the toy and took all the samples back with him to his headquarters in Minneapolis. \"Barrel of Monkeys\" was quickly released in 1965 as a Lakeside toy allowing Marks, Dinhofer and Kesler to receive ongoing royalties. \"Barrel of Monkeys\" initially came in a cardboard tube with a plastic monkey attached to the lid. This tube packaging was similar to Lakeside’s already successful Pick-Up-Sticks, In April 1967, Barrel of Monkeys in a plastic barrel was #2 on \"Toy and Hobby World’s\" Toy Hit Parade chart.\n\nInitially sold in a cardboard tube, Lakeside quickly produced a two-piece plastic barrel that completely replaced the cardboard version by 1966. Unlike the later mono-colored \"Giant Barrel of Monkeys\", this original version included 12 plastic monkeys in three colors; four each in red, blue and yellow.\n\nLakeside Toys was eventually sold to Leisure Dynamics, Inc. in 1969. Leisure was sold to Coleco Industries in 1985, and Coleco was sold to Hasbro Inc. in 1988\n\nThe current Hasbro version is sold with ten monkeys in the barrel.\n\nThese Monkeys have also been used for modeling of polyhedral structures, including virus particles and other protein structures \nIn brief, a pair of monkeys can hook around each other in more than eighty different ways, forming quite stable links. The links may be either symmetrical or asymmetrical. Repetition of an asymmetric link generates a helix. A symmetric link is self-limiting, so that the structure cannot grow further unless a new link is used to join symmetric pairs. It is possible to generate structures with point, line, 2D or 3D symmetry by choosing two or three different links (from the 80 or more possibilities) and repeating them systematically. An enormous number of compatible combinations can be found by trial and error. Many are shown in the sources quoted above.\n\nAny repeating unit can in principle be assembled in this way. The only unusual characteristic of the monkey is that its arms, legs, hands and feet are able to twist around each other to form many stable links. In this, they resemble protein molecules which can also link together in many ways. The resulting assemblies simulate biologically important structures, but their symmetry follows general geometric principles. The monkeys provide a 'hands on' approach to understanding these principles.\n\"Barrel of Monkeys\" is also called as Bandar Keela and is famous in south Asian countries.\n\n"}
{"id": "1472611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1472611", "title": "Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness", "text": "Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness\n\nCastlevania: Legacy of Darkness is an action-adventure platforming video game, that was developed and published by Konami for the Nintendo 64. It was released in North America on November 30, 1999 and is a prequel and expanded version to the first \"Castlevania\" game on the Nintendo 64, but also contains a remake of the original game with improved graphics, added villains, and alternate versions of some levels.\n\nA large part of the game's challenge is based on jumping from platform to platform while avoiding environmental hazards, such as enemies and traps. Platforms are usually stationary, but some may rotate out from under the player, move through the environment like a rail shooter (the gondola in the Tunnel level), and crumble or fall away underfoot. There are also some invisible platforms that either afford players a strategic advantage or lead to hidden items.\n\nCastlevania also includes elements from the survival horror game genre. In addition to the trappings and narrative devices of Gothic horror, players are often placed in situations that evoke feelings of stress, anxiety, and vulnerability. Players may be trapped in caged fights with monsters, such as the battle with the Cerberus hounds in the Villa when the screen darkens to near-black. Some caged battles are timed, such as the boss battles in the Duel Tower level, where the gamer will be crushed by a falling ceiling should they not best their enemy in time. Vampires are also often fought in caged environments, with the added complication that they can latch onto Carrie, Cornell, Henry and Reinhardt to suck their blood. If the player doesn't break free by rapidly rotating the control stick, the character's status changes to \"vamp\" and they will not be able to use their primary weapon or healing items. Unless a specific item is used to recover, the game becomes exponentially more challenging. Castlevania also features two high-stakes survival horror sequences: In the Villa's maze garden, players must help Henry through the labyrinthine hedges while strong, unbeatable enemies give chase. In the Castle Center, players must carefully carry the \"magic nitro\" item through a nerve-wracking obstacle course to its destination. One fall or hit can cause the volatile chemical to explode, resulting in immediate death.\n\nSet in the year 1844, the game stars the man-beast Cornell in his quest to prevent his adoptive sister, Ada, from being used as a sacrifice to resurrect Dracula. The game opens as Cornell arrives at his village, which has been burned to the ground by Dracula's minions. He finds Ada's pendant in a doorway and follows her scent to Dracula's castle.\n\nDuring the course of the game, Cornell comes upon a grand estate owned by the Oldrey family: J.A. Oldrey, the master of the Villa, Mary, his wife, and Henry, their son. Gilles de Rais and Actrise have turned Oldrey Senior into a vampire. At Mary's request, Cornell guides Henry to safety. Later in life, Henry returns to \"Castlevania\" to save kidnapped children.\n\nThroughout the game, Cornell encounters his rival and fellow man-beast, Ortega. Ortega has allied himself with Dracula to finally beat Cornell in combat, turning into a chimera like creature. They eventually battle near the end of the game, just before Cornell defeats Dracula and saves his sister. He only accomplishes the latter by sacrificing his man-wolf powers. Unbeknownst to the hero, acquiring this power was the true aim of the dark forces, as it was the perfect sacrifice (not Ada, as Cornell had assumed) to resurrect Dracula at his full power.\n\n\"Legacy of Darkness\" was a continuation of Konami's first attempt (\"Castlevania\", also published in 1999) to create a 3D \"Castlevania\". The game more fully realizes the game designers' vision. For example, Cornell was present in early development media and press information for \"Castlevania\", but was ultimately removed before the game's release.\n\n\"Legacy\"'s primary focus is on a new story (a prequel to Carrie and Reinhardt's adventures) in which Cornell explores new levels, as well as redesigned levels from Castlevania 64. Levels from Castlevania 64 that have not been drastically changed (such as the Villa) are often navigated in a new or novel manner and feature different puzzles. Completing the game once unlocks Henry's quest, and he explores his own set of levels and new bosses, many are newly redesigned levels based on the levels of Castlevania 64 as well.\n\nCarrie and Reinhardt's quests are a secondary focus (bonus features), that can only be unlocked after completing both Cornell and Henry's quests. Carrie and Reinhardt's quests lack the voice acting, some cutscenes and the original level designs present in \"Castlevania 64\" (due to space concerns), instead adopting the new level designs (from Cornell and Henry's quests). Their quests also feature new bosses from Henry's quest, such as Medusa and the Queen of the Spider. They are also given new armor and weapon designs, though the original starting armor from Castlevania 64 can be unlocked during Henry's quest.\n\nIn \"Legacy\" control of the game's characters, camera, and frame-rate were streamlined. The game also supports the Nintendo 64's Expansion Pak add-on, which allows for an option in which textures are displayed in a higher resolution. However, this mode have some frame-rate issues. \"Legacy of Darkness\" also features several minor additions, such as an alternate costume for Cornell and new alternate costumes for Carrie and Reinhardt (their original costumes from \"Castlevania 64\").\n\n\"Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness\" was present within the series' original chronology from its original release until 2002, when a timeline published on the official Japanese \"\" website omitted it – as well as several other \"Castlevania\" games – from the series' continuity. The others also included \"Castlevania Legends\" for the Game Boy, \"\" and the original \"Castlevania\" release for the Nintendo 64.\n\nIn 2006, series producer Koji Igarashi stated that \"These games were taken out of the timeline [...] not because I didn't work on them, but because they were considered by their directors to be side projects in the series\". Since the 2002 removal, the events of \"Legacy of Darkness\" have occupied an ambiguous place in timelines published by Konami of Japan, Konami of America, and various gaming publications. The most recent English language timeline, distributed with preordered versions of \"\" in North America by Konami of America, includes Legacy of Darkness but does not describe the game's plot.

It was released in the United States in 1991 on the TurboGrafx-16 and again for the Game Boy Advance on October 15, 2002. It is the North American port of Tennis Cup, previously released in 1989 on micro-computers.\n\nIn the GBA version's two game modes, the player assumes control of either a tennis player during a single match or an entire country's team in the Davis Cup, an international competition. Multiplayer is supported through the link cable. The game garnered mixed reviews from critics, who overall felt that it paled in comparison to 2002's \"Virtua Tennis\" and earlier versions of \"Mario Tennis\".\n\nThe game follows the rules of tennis closely. Each match has a minimum of 5 sets by default. Players are able to control the difficulty of the AI before starting their game as well. The player can either choose to play a \"Quick Play\" mode which allows for a single tennis match, or to play through the full Davis Cup, where the player must choose the team captain and compete through the entire tournament with the rotating player rotation.\n\nThe tennis players are represented by two-dimensional sprites, while the court is given the illusion of being three-dimensional. Players are able to control the power of their initial serve, but cannot control how hard they hit balls already in play.\n\n\"Davis Cup Tennis\" garnered mixed reviews from gaming press, who felt that the game was lackluster compared to \"Virtua Tennis\". GameSpot's Frank Provo and IGN's Craig Harris both criticized the lack of an in-game save option that you could activate during your match, with Craig Harris remarking that the design \"isn't exactly handheld friendly\". Frank Provo felt that the larger variety of techniques found in \"Virtua Tennis\" made it \"the better option\". GameSpy's Avi Fryman remarked on the game's averageness in comparison to its competitors, commenting \"... if all available copies of \"Virtua Tennis\" and \"Mario Tennis\" suddenly vaporized, there might be a reason for casual gamers to pick this one up.\"\n"}

{"id": "11104696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11104696", "title": "Figure and ground (media)", "text": "Figure and ground (media)\n\nFigure and ground is a concept drawn from Gestalt psychology by media theorist Marshall McLuhan in the early 1970s. This concept underpins the meaning of his famous phrase, \"The medium is the message\". The concept was an approach to what was called \"perceptual organization.\" He began to use the terms figure and ground as a way \"to describe the parts of a situation\" and \"to help explain his ideas about media and human communication.\" The concept was later employed to explain how a communications technology, the medium or \"figure\", necessarily operates through its context, or \"ground\".\n\nTo McLuhan, \"‘figure’ refers to something that jumps out at us, something that grabs our attention, [whereas] ‘ground’ refers to something that supports or contextualizes a situation and is usually an area of unattention.\" When we first experience a new image or sensation, there are certain aspects of the object that grab our attention and engage us and certain aspects that we unintentionally ignore. We should not focus on just the \"figure\" or the \"ground\" though, as McLuhan believed that both were equally as important to understanding the full meaning of the situation. \"This distinction between that which is perceived and that which is blocked out in order to focus perception is central for McLuhan.\"\n\nMcLuhan used different words to describe the figure/ground relationship, sometimes using content for figure and environment or, more often, medium for ground.\n\n\"McLuhan looked at media through a figure/ground relationship.\" To him, people tended to focus on only specific parts of the media, and disregard other parts. \"To examine the total effect of any medium, McLuhan pointed out that we need to look at both figure AND ground, and their relationship to one another.\" He believed that \"only focusing on the ‘content’ of the media was like looking at figures without examining their ground.\" \"The ground, or environment, is not a passive container, but active processes that influence the relationships between all of the elements in it.\"\n\nMcLuhan believed that to fully grasp the impact of a new technology in regard to figure (medium) and ground (context), one must understand that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Neither piece is definitive without the other. His \"Understanding Media\" explores different grounds as they are structured by different media including print, radio, and television.\n\nAl Held, a well-known artist, exemplifies this idea in one of his paintings. The work is called The Big N and it \"provides us with an introduction to the concepts of figure and ground.\" Looking at a glance, you might draw your attention to the black triangles. \"Once you were given the name of the painting, however, the frame became linked to the figures, and an 'N' suddenly appeared.\" In understanding the work, it is important to look at the bigger picture. Al Held’s painting is well-known for its display of framing, or context, and its importance to the meaning of the overall situation. If either the frame or the painting itself were to change, the interpretation of the work might shift. Pertaining to media, we must look at both the figure and the ground to \"understand [its] effects.\" The ground which media creates gives a context for human communication, and thus \"directs human action in unique and important ways.\"\n\nMcLuhan argued that we must study media in their historical context, particularly in relation to those technologies that preceded them. The present environment, itself made up of the effects of previous technologies, gives rise to new technologies, which, in turn, further shapes societies and individuals.\n\nFurthermore, all technologies have embedded within them their own assumptions about time and space. Again, the message conveyed by the medium can only be understood if the medium is concurrently analyzed with the environment in which it is used — and which, simultaneously, it effectively creates. McLuhan believed that an examination of the figure-ground relationship can offer a critical commentary on culture and society.\n\nAlternately, the idea of \"figure\" can also refer to content of a particular medium, while \"ground\" refers to the medium itself. McLuhan's aphorism \"The medium is the message\" can thus be read as an attempt to draw attention away from a preoccupation with the figure/message to a consideration of the importance of the ground/medium.\n\nFigure-ground (perception)\n"}

{"id": "714334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=714334", "title": "Freddy vs. Jason", "text": "Freddy vs. Jason\n\nFreddy vs. Jason (alternatively known as A Nightmare on Friday the 13th) is a 2003 American slasher film directed by Ronny Yu and written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift. The film is a spin-off crossover between \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" and \"Friday the 13th\" series, and pits Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees against each other in the eighth and eleventh installments in their respective series. The film is also the last in both \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" and \"Friday the 13th\" series before they were both rebooted.\n\nIn the film, Freddy (Robert Englund) has grown incapable of haunting people's dreams as the citizens of Springwood, Ohio, have mostly forgotten about him following his death and subsequent imprisonment in Hell for his sins. To regain his power and freedom, Freddy resurrects Jason (Ken Kirzinger) and manipulates him into traveling to Springwood to cause panic and fear, leading to rumors that Freddy has returned. However, while Jason succeeds in causing enough fear for Freddy to haunt the town again, Jason angers Freddy by depriving him of potential victims. This ultimately sends the two undead monsters into a violent conflict.\n\n\"Freddy vs. Jason\" was released in the United States on August 15, 2003. It grossed $114 million, making it the highest-grossing film in the \"Friday the 13th\" series and the second-highest-grossing film in \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" series. It is however the second highest grossing film in the Friday the 13th series but the highest grossing film in the A Nightmare on Elm Street series with $174 million when adjusted for inflation. The film is Englund's final canonical appearance as Freddy Krueger, though he did appear as the character in an episode of \"The Goldbergs\".\n\nIn September 2003, Four Years After \"\" And Three Months After \"\", Freddy Krueger is rendered powerless in Hell because the people of Springwood manage to make the youth forget about him. Disguised as Pamela Voorhees, Freddy manipulates Jason Voorhees into coming back to life and start killing Springwood teenagers to generate fear of Freddy's presumed return. In Springwood, Lori Campbell lives with her widowed father and has her friends Kia Waterson, Gibb Smith, Trey, and Blake staying over. That night, Jason kills Trey, and the police suspect Freddy, fearing his return. Following a nightmare where Freddy tries to kill Blake but fails due to not being powerful enough, Blake awakens to find his father beheaded before Jason kills him as well. The next day, police claim it to be a murder–suicide, hoping to contain Freddy.\n\nLori's ex-boyfriend Will Rollins and friend Mark Davis are patients at Westin Hills Psychiatric Hospital. They take Hypnocil to suppress their dreams due to previous contact with Freddy. A news report about the murders motivate Mark and Will to escape and return to Springwood in order to warn Lori about Freddy. That night, Lori and the others attend a rave at a cornfield. Freddy tries to kill Gibb in a nightmare, but Jason kills her in the real world along with several other attendees, which causes Freddy to realize that Jason's rampage will deny him victims.\n\nCharlie Linderman and Bill Freeburg escape the rave along with Will, Lori, and Kia. Later, Will explains to Lori that the reason he was sent to Westin Hills was because he saw her father murder her mother, before going to Mark's house. However, they discover Freddy killing Mark and leaving a message on his body that declares his return. Deputy Scott Stubbs approaches Lori and her friends, who realize Freddy's plan and convince him of the truth. Learning of Hypnocil, they attempt to steal it from Westin Hills and see many teenagers in a coma-like-state due to prolonged Hypnocil use, but Freddy possesses Freeburg and disposes of the medicine. Having followed them, Jason electrocutes Stubbs to death but is tranquilized by a possessed Freeburg, whom Jason kills before falling asleep.\n\nTaking Jason's body with them, the teens devise a plan to pull Freddy from the dream world into reality and force him to fight Jason. They take the unconscious Jason to the now abandoned Camp Crystal Lake. Meanwhile, Freddy battles Jason in the dream world. where Freddy has the advantage due to his dream powers. Freddy learns that Jason is afraid of water (a plot device that contradicts earlier \"Friday the 13th\" films with the exception of \"Jason Takes Manhattan\") and uses this fear to render Jason powerless. Meanwhile, Lori goes to sleep and tries to save Jason. Freddy attacks her and reveals himself as her mother's killer, having possessed her father to do it.\n\nJason awakens at Camp Crystal Lake and chases the teens into a cabin. Linderman is killed after trying to fight Jason and the cabin ignites. Lori is awakened and manages to pull Freddy into the real world where he is confronted by Jason. As the two begin to fight, the remaining teens escape the cabin.\n\nFreddy escapes Jason and goes after the teens, but he is distracted by Kia—until Jason suddenly kills her. The two killers resume their battle until they reach a dock on the lake, where Freddy stabs Jason's eyes, and Jason tears off Freddy's clawed arm. Lori and Will attempt to kill the two by pouring gasoline on the dock and setting it ablaze. Some propane tanks explode nearby, blasting Jason and Freddy into the lake. Freddy climbs out and attempts to kill Lori and Will, but is impaled by Jason with his own clawed arm before the latter falls back into the lake. Lori decapitates Freddy, avenging the deaths of her friends and her mother. Freddy's body falls into the lake and sinks to the bottom. Lori and Will leave Camp Crystal Lake as the only survivors.\n\nThe next day, Jason emerges from the water, holding his machete and Freddy's severed head. However, Freddy winks to the audience before laughing off-screen.\n\nZack Ward makes an appearance as Bobby Davis, Mark's older brother. A then-unknown Evangeline Lilly has a brief walk-on role as a high school student, and professional wrestler Óscar Gutiérrez, better known by his ring name Rey Mysterio, briefly serves as Englund's stunt double for a sequence set in Freddy Krueger's iconic boiler room lair. New Line Cinema studio chief Robert Shaye, who served as producer on every preceding \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" film, appears as the school principal, credited as L.E. Moko.\n\nInfluenced by fans' desire for a crossover film depicting a fight between the two icons, New Line and Paramount tried to make a \"Freddy vs. Jason\" movie in 1987. But the two studios failed to agree on a story. When \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" failed to perform successfully at the box office, Sean Cunningham decided that he wanted to reacquire the rights to \"Friday the 13th\" and start working with New Line Cinema on \"Freddy vs. Jason\", as New Line owned \"Nightmare on Elm Street\". The concept of a fight between Freddy and Jason was not new; Paramount had approached New Line about filming a crossover years before the latter had gained the licensing rights to \"Friday the 13th\". At that time, both companies wanted the license to the other's character so that they could control the making of the film. Negotiations on the project were never finalized, which led Paramount to make \"The New Blood\". After \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" was released in 1989 the rights reverted to Scuderi, Minasian, and Barsamianto, who sold them to New Line. Before Cunningham could start working on \"Freddy vs. Jason\", Wes Craven returned to New Line to make \"New Nightmare\". This effectively put \"Freddy vs. Jason\" on hold, but allowed Cunningham the chance to bring Jason back into the spotlight with \"Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday\". The ninth installment \"turned a healthy profit\", though it was only intended to open the door for a crossover with Freddy Krueger, rather than start a new series for New Line. Cunningham's \"frustration\" with the delayed development of the \"Freddy vs. Jason\" project forced him to create another sequel titled \"Jason X\" in an effort to keep the series in the minds of audiences. Based on \"Jason Takes Manhattan\"s concept of taking Jason away from Crystal Lake, the tenth film would put the titular character in space. The film suffered from the loss of its biggest supporter, President of Production Michael De Luca, when he resigned from his position. Lack of support forced the finished film to sit for two years before finally being released on April 26, 2002; it would go on to become the lowest grossing film in the series at the domestic box office; it also held the distinction of having the largest budget of any of the previous films at that time.\n\nAccording to writers Mark Swift and Damian Shannon, several endings were considered for the film. One of the unused endings involved Pinhead of the \"Hellraiser\" franchise; however, New Line was discontent with securing the rights to the character. New Line believed \"Freddy vs. Jason\" needed a fresh start, and chose a new actor for Jason. Cunningham disagreed with their decision, believing Kane Hodder was the best choice for the role. Hodder did receive the script for \"Freddy vs. Jason\", and had a meeting with director Ronny Yu and New Line executives, but Matthew Barry and Yu felt the role should be recast to fit Yu's image of Jason. According to Hodder, New Line didn't provide him with a reason for the recasting, but Yu has explained he wanted a slower, more deliberate Jason, and less of the aggressive movements that Hodder had used in the previous films. The role eventually went to Ken Kirzinger, a Canadian stuntman who worked on \"Jason Takes Manhattan\". There are conflicting reports over the reason Kirzinger was cast. According to Yu, Kirzinger was hired because he was taller than Robert Englund, the actor who portrays Freddy Krueger. Kirzinger stands 6' 5\" (196 cm), compared to the 6' 3\" (191 cm) of Kane Hodder. Yu wanted a much larger actor to tower over the 5' 9\" (175 cm) Englund. Kirzinger believes his experience on \"Part VIII\" helped him land the part, as Kirzinger doubled for Hodder on two scenes for the film, but also believes he was simply sized up and handed the job. Although he was hired by the crew, New Line did not officially cast Kirzinger until first seeing him on film. Kirzinger's first scene was Jason walking down Elm Street. New Line wanted a specific movement in Jason's walk; Kirzinger met their expectations and signed a contract with the studio.\n\nDouglas Tait portrayed Jason for a reshot ending. In an interview, Tait explained the reason for the reshoot saying, \"Unfortunately for me, it was the only scene I was hired to do. The test audiences were confused about the original ending, they thought Jason Ritter’s character was becoming . You can see it in the deleted scenes, that is why they decided to reshoot the ending. Originally I was being considered for playing the role of Jason in the entire film. It was actually between me and Ken. When they took the film to Canada, I was out of luck. There was no way they were going to pay for my flight and hotel stay when Ken was a local. Also, Ken is older than me and he was a lot more established in the business than I was at the time.\" Describing the scene, Tait said \"I was on the film for a couple days. The water sequence took a lot of preparation. They realized that when I got wet, I looked too skinny in the clothes, so they had to bulk me up with pads and extra clothing so it would look like I was still big. Being with all this extra weight, one eye covered, a machete in one hand, Freddy’s head in another hand, and being totally submerged in water, made that scene very difficult. Also, Ronny Yu wanted me to walk like I was walking on land. He wanted it to look like I could walk through the water without it making me rise to the surface. To do this effect, they had a rope tied under water that I held onto with my left hand (with Freddy’s severed head in it also), and I held myself down on the ground so I could pull myself and walk forward.\"\n\nPublishing company Black Flame released a novelization of the film on July 29, 2003.\n\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD as part of New Line's Platinum Series on January 13, 2004. The DVD release featured a second disc of bonus content that included: audio commentary by Ronny Yu, Ken Kirzinger, and Robert Englund, deleted and alternate scenes with commentary, Ill Niño's music video to \"How Can I Live\", trailers and TV spots, soundtrack promo and behind the scenes featurettes.\n\nThe film was released on UMD on October 4, 2005 and on Blu-ray September 8, 2009. The Blu-ray contained the same features as the original Platinum Edition DVD. The film was also released as part of a 9-disc pack of all twelve Friday the 13th films on Blu-ray and a Triple Feature Blu-ray pack with the \"Friday\" and \"Nightmare\" remakes.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 41% based on 158 reviews and an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Fans of the two horror franchises will enjoy this showdown. But for everyone else, it's the same old slice and dice.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has an average score of 37 out of 100 based on 29 reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nDoug Chapman and Melvin Martinez were nominated for the Best Fire Stunt in the Taurus World Stunt Awards 2004 for the double full body burn and wire stunt. Doug Chapman doubled for Robert Englund as Freddy and Glenn Ennis doubled for Ken Kirzinger as Jason in the stunt.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "183505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183505", "title": "Gypsy Rose Lee", "text": "Gypsy Rose Lee\n\nGypsy Rose Lee (born Rose Louise Hovick, January 8, 1911 – April 26, 1970) was an American burlesque entertainer and vedette famous for her striptease act. Also an actress, author, and playwright, was adapted into the 1959 stage musical \"\".\n\nGypsy Rose Lee was born in Seattle, Washington, on January 8, 1911; however, she always gave January 9 as her date of birth. She was known as Louise to her family. Her sister, actress June Havoc, was born in 1912. Their mother, Rose Thompson Hovick, forged various birth certificates for each of her daughters—older when needed to evade varying state child labor laws, and younger for reduced or free train fares. The girls were unsure until later in life what their years of birth were.\n\nTheir mother had married Norwegian-American John Olaf Hovick, a newspaper-advertising salesman and a reporter at \"The Seattle Times\". They married on May 28, 1910, in Seattle. They divorced on August 20, 1915. Rose Thompson married her second husband, Judson Brennerman, a traveling salesman, on May 26, 1916, at a Unitarian church in Seattle, with the Rev. J. D. A. Powers officiating.\n\nAfter Hovick and Brennerman divorced, June supported the family by appearing in vaudeville, being billed \"Tiniest Toe Dancer in the World\" when she was only 2½. Rose and June went to Hollywood for two years where June appeared in short films directed by Hal Roach. Louise was left behind while June and her mother were on the road. She had an elementary education, unlike June who was taught to read by stage-hands. Much to her mother's displeasure, June eloped with Bobby Reed, a dancer in their act, in December 1928, and went on to pursue a brief career in marathon dancing, a more profitable vocation than tap dancing.\n\nLouise's singing and dancing talents were insufficient to sustain the act without June. Eventually, it became apparent that Louise could make money in burlesque, which earned her legendary status as an elegant and witty striptease artist. Initially, her act was propelled forward when a shoulder strap on one of her gowns gave way, causing her dress to fall to her feet despite her efforts to cover herself; encouraged by the audience's response, she went on to make the trick the focus of her performance.\n\nHer innovations were an almost casual stripping style compared to the herky-jerky styles of most burlesque strippers (she emphasized the \"tease\" in \"striptease\"), and she brought a sharp sense of humor into her act as well. She became as famous for her onstage wit as for her stripping style, and—changing her stage name to Gypsy Rose Lee—she became one of the biggest stars of Minsky's Burlesque, where she performed for four years. She was frequently arrested in raids on the Minsky brothers' shows. During the Great Depression, Lee spoke at various union meetings in support of New York laborers. According to activist Harry Fisher, her talks were among those that attracted the largest audiences.\n\nIn 1937 and 1938, billed as Louise Hovick, she made five films in Hollywood. But her acting was generally panned, so she returned to New York City where she had an affair with film producer Michael Todd and co-produced and appeared in his 1942 musical revue, \"Star and Garter\".\n\nLee viewed herself as a \"high-class\" stripper, and she approved of H. L. Mencken's term \"ecdysiast\", which he coined as a more \"dignified\" way of referring to the profession. Her style of intellectual recitation while stripping was spoofed in the number \"Zip!\" in Rodgers and Hart's \"Pal Joey\", a musical in which Havoc had appeared on Broadway, opposite Gene Kelly. Lee performed an abbreviated version of her act (intellectual recitation and all) in the 1943 film \"Stage Door Canteen\". Her routine starts at about 1 hour 29 minutes into the film and lasts about six minutes.\n\nIn 1941, Lee authored a mystery thriller called \"The G-String Murders\", which was made into the sanitized 1943 film, \"Lady of Burlesque\" starring Barbara Stanwyck. While some assert this was in fact ghost-written by Craig Rice, there are those who claim that there is more than sufficient written evidence in the form of manuscripts and Lee's own correspondence to prove that she wrote a large part of the novel herself under the guidance of Rice and others, including her editor George Davis, a friend and mentor. Lee's second murder mystery, \"Mother Finds a Body\", was published in 1942. In December 1942, preliminary papers alleging breach of contract were filed in the Supreme Court against Lee by Dorothy Wheelock, associate editor of Harper's Bazaar alleging that in August 1940 she and Gypsy entered into what Wheelock described as \"an oral agreement to collaborate on a joint venture involving the conception, construction, development, writing and exploitation of a literary work with a burlesque background. The agreement, Miss Wheelock went on, called for a 50:50 split on all income from sale of the book. She charged that she had lined up a publisher for the book when, in November 1940, Gypsy called off the collaboration ... Lee said she turned over notes and other material to Miss Wheelock and that the latter had then written 'a sample book'. However this sample book is not the book that was published, Gypsy declared. She denied any resemblance between Miss Wheelock's book and the book published under her own name, except such similarities as might stem from the notes Gypsy turned over to Miss Wheelock. Simon & Schuster agreed to publish the book, Gypsy said, after the first three chapters were shown to them by Janet Flanner, a New York writer\". The case was settled out of court.\n\nIn Hollywood, she married Arnold \"Bob\" Mizzy on August 25, 1937, at the insistence of the film studio. She obtained a divorce in 1941, claiming cruelty, although biographer Noralee Frankel suggests the couple agreed that Lee could bring false charges so the divorce could go through uncontested. In 1942, she married William Alexander Kirkland; they divorced in 1944. While married to Kirkland, she gave birth on December 11, 1944, to a son fathered by Otto Preminger. Her son was named Erik Lee, but has since been known successively as Erik Kirkland, Erik de Diego, and Erik Lee Preminger. Gypsy married a third time in 1948, to Julio de Diego, but that union also ended in divorce.\n\nIn 1940, she purchased a townhouse on East 63rd St in Manhattan with a private courtyard, 26 rooms and seven baths. Mother Rose continued to demand money from Lee and Havoc. Lee rented a 10-room apartment on West End Avenue in Manhattan for Rose, who opened a boardinghouse for women there. On one occasion in the 1930s, Rose shot and killed a woman who was either a guest at the boardinghouse or a guest on the farm in Highland Mills in Orange County, New York, that Rose owned. An historical website for lesbians cites varying reports of which place was the scene of the crime. According to Gypsy's son Erik Lee Preminger, who is the author of several books, the murder victim was Mother Rose's female lover, who had allegedly made a pass at Gypsy. The violent incident was investigated and reportedly explained away as a suicide. Mother Rose was not prosecuted. Mother Rose's biographer strongly refutes the notion that this woman, Genevieve Augustine, was Rose's lover, and doubts Rose's complicity in her death in light of Augustine's previous suicide attempts. Rose Thompson Hovick died in 1954 of colon cancer.\n\nAfter the death of their mother, the sisters now felt free to write about her without risking a lawsuit. \"\" was published in 1957 and served as inspiration for the Jule Styne, Stephen Sondheim, and Arthur Laurents 1959 musical \"Gypsy\". Havoc did not like the way she was portrayed in the piece, but she was eventually persuaded (and paid) not to oppose it for her sister's sake. The show and the 1962 movie adaptation assured Gypsy a steady income. The sisters became estranged for a period of time but reconciled. June, in turn, wrote \"Early Havoc\" and \"More Havoc\", to relate her version of the story. Gypsy Rose Lee went on to host a morning San Francisco KGO-TV television talk show, \"Gypsy\". The walls of her Los Angeles home were adorned with pictures by Joan Miró, Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Max Ernst, and Dorothea Tanning, all reportedly given to her by the artists themselves.\n\nLike many other Americans, and well-known artists such as Pablo Picasso and Ernest Hemingway, Gypsy Rose Lee was a supporter of the Popular Front movement in the Spanish Civil War and raised money for charity to alleviate the suffering of Spanish children during the conflict. \"She became politically active, and supported Spanish Loyalists during Spain's Civil War. She also became a fixture at Communist United Front meetings, and was investigated by the House Committee on un-American activities.\" Lee was a Democrat who supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential election.\nLee died of lung cancer in Los Angeles in 1970, aged 59. She is buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Cheerleading Worlds is the \"final destination\" in an All Star Cheerleaders life. It is where they show everything they have in two minute and thirty seconds in hopes of becoming World Champions. The day before JAMfest Super Nationals actually starts, another competition is held for certain elite teams from all over. This smaller competition is only a one day event, and your team must be invited to compete. This one day event is known as the Majors and the teams that compete in it, are classified as \"the best of the best\". \n\nThe Cheerleading Worlds is the highest success for any all star level 5 team. The Cheerleading Worlds competition is held in Orlando, Florida every year. School teams and \"All-Star\" teams once competed against each other when this competition was first founded. The National Cheerleaders Association decided that these teams needed to be separated. So they created different divisions for each level of team and their difficulty. Teams attend competitions like JAMfest Super Nationals to obtain a bid to this competition. Cheerleaders are only able to compete at worlds if their team receives a bid or an \"invite.\" The Cheerleading Worlds is held every year in Orlando, Florida at ESPNs Wide World of Sports. On top of trophies, banners, and medals that can be won, they also win a World Champion ring. \n\nJammy is not only the mascot for JAMfest Cheer and Dance but he is also their spirit icon.

{"id": "7711850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7711850", "title": "List of EastEnders two-hander episodes", "text": "List of EastEnders two-hander episodes\n\n\"EastEnders\" two-hander episodes refers to singular episodes of the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\" that feature only two members of the cast for the duration. Scripted like mini-plays, two-hander episodes have become a tradition in \"EastEnders\" over the years, dating back to a groundbreaking episode in 1986, which featured publicans Den Watts and Angie Watts. Devoting an entire half an hour of drama to just two characters had previously been unheard of in a bi-weekly serial before this episode aired, but it set a precedent for the programme and it has featured two-handers ever since.\n\nTypically the episodes feature revelations and major character changes to an important relationship, and intense interactions between two prominent characters. Structuring the episode in this way allows for in-depth focus on a specific character/storyline that would be impossible to achieve in the fast-moving and rapidly cut regular episodes. It also relies on just the one story and two actors to hold the audience for the entire duration of the episode.\n\nPractically, these episodes were originally created for speedy filming purposes, as while the two actors were filming the two-hander, the remaining cast could be filming another episode.\n\nThe first two-hander featured Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson). The episode was structured like a tennis match, with a non-speaking window cleaner forever strolling innocently into the action. The episode was written by Jane Hollowood and directed by Antonia Bird. This episode was watched by 14.0 million viewers. It was decided to give Den and Angie a two-hander due to the popularity of the couple.\n\nDen and Angie's marriage had been hanging by a thread all year, and in October 1986 Den finally decided that it was over and attempted to leave Angie for his mistress, Jan Hammond (Jane How). The episode began with Den trying to talk to Angie to tell her that he wanted to leave her and get a divorce. Angie stalled but Den persisted and stated his case. Den told her that he wanted a clean break from her, the pub, Albert Square and Walford. He told her he'd be getting another pub through a deal with James Wilmott-Brown (William Boyde) and Jan would be doing the books. Angie was shocked and for a moment defeated but she then dropped her bombshell and told Den that she only had six months to live. At first Den didn't believe her, but Angie kept to her story and, finally, her hysterical performance convinced him. Den crumbled and promised to stay with her saying \"If I ever find out you're kidding me, Ange, I'll kill ya...\" and then, consumed by guilt, he asked her for forgiveness. As he left to take Roly for a walk and be alone, Angie broke into a deranged smile, letting the audience in on her secret that she had been lying.\n\nThe second two-hander featured the old friends Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), who were baby-sitting Vicki Fowler (Emma Henry) one rainy afternoon. This episode centred around nostalgia and growing old and was scripted to show the sadness behind the often comical characters of Dot and Ethel. The episode was written by Charlie Humphreys and directed by Mike Gibbon, a future producer of the show.\n\nWhile baby Vicki napped, Dot and Ethel reminisced about their lives during World War II]and shared secrets from their girlhoods. During the war Ethel was 17 and remained in London where she witnessed the death of her family, who were killed by a German doodlebug. Dot was evacuated to Wales when she was three years old and stayed with a couple she called Auntie Gwen and Uncle Will, who wanted to adopt her. Dot later confessed that she had an abortion soon after she married Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock) because he told her he would leave her if she kept the baby. This caused a furious Dr Harold Legg (Leonard Fenton) to punch Charlie on the nose in The Queen Vic. Towards the end of the episode Dot went out to the shop for a [oaf]of bread and some fig rolls. When she returned Ethel was asleep and Dot thought she had died and began weeping and reciting the Lord's Prayer. When Ethel roused, Dot panicked and Ethel had to slap her out of it.\n\nThe third two-hander featured the best friends Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). In the aftermath of Sharon's father's death, the two friends started an evening at home with a bottle of wine and their memories. This episode was written by Tony McHale and directed by Mike Gibbon.\n\nAfter Den Watts's (Leslie Grantham) supposed murder, Sharon - his adoptive daughter - began to speculate about the identity of the mysterious woman who had been seen with him prior to his death. When Sharon told Michelle that she felt that she and her daughter Vicki Fowler (Samantha Leigh Martin) were now her family, Michelle blurted out a secret that she'd been keeping for over 3 years - that Den was Vicki's father and she was the mystery woman who was seen with Den before his death. Michelle thought Sharon would be comforted to know that she was, in a sense, Vicki's sister, and that a part of Den lived on in Vicki. However, Sharon took the news very badly, feeling hurt, angry and deceived. After slapping Michelle and having an emotional showdown, Sharon left their flat wishing that Michelle had never told her.\n\nThis episode featured the Mitchell brothers, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp). Following Grant's discovery that Phil had slept with his wife, Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean), Grant had beaten Phil so badly that he was hospitalised with a dangerous blood clot to the brain. Phil was rushed into surgery, and the clot was removed. As Grant sat with his brother, the two made a pact and promised that they would never let a woman come between them again.\n\nAs Phil awoke from his surgery he found his brother sleeping next to him, holding his hand. Grant awoke and instantly got defensive claiming that he was only there because their friend Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley) had persuaded him. As the two started talking Grant started to reminisce about the past when a girl he was dating came onto Phil and he told him. He asked him if that's what it was like with Sharon. Did she come onto him? And why didn't he tell him? Phil told him it wasn't like that, but Grant kept on calling Sharon a slut and blaming her for the whole affair. He was angry with himself for marrying a slapper. Phil tried to tell him that Sharon wasn't a slut, but his protests fell on deaf ears. Grant proceeded to ask Phil how easy Sharon was to pull. He wouldn't answer, but Grant persisted saying that he never used to be so bashful. After continual pestering Phil began to get agitated and told Grant that Sharon was easy and he didn't even have to get out of first gear.\n\nThey then began to talk about their relationship, how people used to hate them because they were so close and could do anything together and this was always Sharon's problem. After they reminisced about their many conquests with women Grant returned to the topic of Sharon. He was planning to crush her \"like a table tennis ball\" and make her pay for what she'd done. Phil warned him not to do anything stupid, which angered Grant and he accused him of sticking up for Sharon, but Phil assured him he was merely concerned for his welfare. He persuaded Grant that if the two of them didn't stick together, Grant would end up back in prison. He promised Grant that he'd do anything for him and as Grant began to weep Phil promised that from now on, it will be just the two of them.\n\nThis episode featured Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement) and Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). Peggy was on the warpath after being told about a fabricated affair between her fiancé Frank (Mike Reid) and his ex-wife Pat. However Pat had other concerns. Her husband, Roy Evans (Tony Caunter), had driven off like a suicidal maniac nearly hitting her in the process. As Frank sped off after Roy, Pat and Peggy waited it out in the Evans household and made their feelings to each other clear.\n\nPat was in shock about Roy nearly hitting her, but convinced herself that he merely didn't see her. Peggy was not so sure and commented that running her down was cheaper than divorce, and suggested that Roy had also found out about her affair. Pat insisted that nothing happened between her and Frank, but Peggy took a lot of convincing, and they both traded insults at each other. Pat told Peggy that Frank talked about her a lot, but Peggy couldn't accept this and when Pat left the room for a bath, Peggy began to sob. Pat eventually joined her and Peggy accused her of still loving Frank. Pat didn't quite deny it, but said she has moved on and knows when to give up on something. Peggy was convinced that Frank had feelings for Pat too.\n\nAfter opening a bottle of wine Pat began to feel sorry for herself, saying that she was cursed and turned rich, happy men into disasters - Roy was broke and impotent, whereas Frank who has spent a couple of years away from her, was back to his old virile self. Peggy was amazed to discover that Roy was impotent and Pat was quick to point out that sex wasn't important and she was happy to have finally found a man who wanted her to settle down.\n\nAfter the police arrived to inform Pat that their search for Roy had been fruitless, Peggy pestered them for some information, which made her suspect that Roy had come to harm. Now feeling more sympathetic Peggy went to converse with Pat, but the atmosphere soon became frosty once again when each began to recount their wonderful times with Frank. Pat stuck the knife in further by saying that she could have slept with Frank if she'd wanted to the night before, he still fancied her and the least encouragement would have sufficed. The bitching continued with Pat branding Peggy \"mutton dressed as lamb\" and Peggy blaming Pat's appearance for Roy's impotence. Their rowing finally descended into violence as both ladies threw wine glasses at each other and then a fight started when Peggy grabbed the edge of the kitchen table and threw it over to clear the way to attack Pat. The episode ended with Pat slapping Peggy, saying \"YOU BITCH!\" and Peggy slapping Pat right back, exclaiming \"YOU COW!\", right before the doorbell rang.\n\nOccurring simultaneously to the Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement) and Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) two-hander described above, this episode featured Roy Evans (Tony Caunter) and Frank Butcher (Mike Reid). After Roy sped off nearly hitting Pat with his car, Frank followed him and forced him to rethink a drastic decision.\n\nFrank followed Roy's car as he sped off extremely erratically. Eventually Roy turned into a multi-storey car park, drove to the top and crashed the car into some rubble. He then made his way to the roof, and stood on the edge contemplating suicide. Frank followed and tried to persuade him to get down, saying he should think about his family, who will blame themselves and about Pat who thinks that he tried to kill her earlier. Roy claimed that he didn't see her, but added that it was all hopeless and he had lost everything, so there was no point living. Frank pointed out that he had a family who loved him and money was not important. Frank eventually persuaded him to come down to talk, promising that if he felt the same afterwards, he would bring him back and not stop him from taking his own life. Roy agreed and the two of them went to a strip club and ordered a couple of brandies. Roy continued to explain the reason for his depression. He had been conned in a car deal and was facing bankruptcy. Frank told Roy that they had more in common than he might think, as he once tried to commit suicide too, was left bankrupt and he made the mistake of not going back to Pat then, but for Roy it wasn't too late.\n\nRoy felt that Pat was still in love with Frank, and then accidentally let slip about his impotency, which only humiliated him further. Frank was understanding and promised he wouldn't tell anyone, and he in turn shared a story with Roy, relaying that he had fathered a child with some young girl he met when he had his breakdown, and no one else knew. Roy was comforted to know that Frank had skeletons in his closet too, and eventually agreed to go home. Frank drove them back, they rang the bell at the Evanses just as Peggy and Pat's fight was in full flow. Pat was thrilled to see Roy, and Peggy a little less thrilled to see Frank, so he asked her if they were still engaged. She responded \"Just\".\n\nThis episode featured Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom). Steve had let Matthew serve time in prison for Saskia Duncan's (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor) murder. Upon his release Matthew came to Walford looking for revenge. 19.8 million viewers watched this episode.\n\nWhen Matthew turned up at e20 nightclub Steve was shocked by the visible transformation and could see that Matthew was seeking revenge. Matthew produced a video - he had rigged Steve's flat with booby traps and Steve knew it was only a matter of time before his sister Jackie Owen (Race Davies) arrived home to trigger them. Matthew demanded £10,000. Steve tried to gain the upper hand by pulling his gun from the safe, but Matthew was one step ahead and had already removed the bullets. As they struggled Matthew grabbed a bottle and knocked Steve unconscious. He then tied and bound him to the chair.\n\nWhen Steve came to he tried to use a piece of smashed bottle to free himself, and managed to grab hold of the gun Matthew was waving in his face. He demanded that Matthew remove the booby traps from his flat. However Matthew stopped Steve in his tracks by revealing that he had killed Saskia's sister, Claudia (Romla Walker), and framed him for the deed, just as he had done to him. Steve buckled and fell to the floor, unable to take in what was happening. He began to beg and cry, whilst Matthew splattered petrol around the room and then pulled a zippo lighter from his pocket. As he lit the lighter and dropped it to the floor Steve was gripped with fear. However he soon realised that there was no fire or smoke. Matthew had used water instead of petrol and had invented the whole scenario to belittle him and watch him beg for mercy.\n\nThis episode featured Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) and his long-time employer Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). After losing his wife, son, and finally his mind Ricky said an emotional farewell to the Square, and Phil tried to talk him out of leaving.\n\nRicky had sped out of Walford in his car and been involved in an accident. Phil went after him and passed the police retrieving the wreck of Ricky's car. They told him to go to the police station. Phil arrived and Ricky appeared - he had been caught over the limit doing when he crashed.\n\nRicky was furious with Phil for allowing him to work on dodgy motors at The Arches, and was even more annoyed when he discovered that the car he had totalled was stolen. Ricky threatened to go back to the station to tell the police everything. Phil forced him to get into the car, but whilst he was being driven away he told Phil that he was not going home, and started fighting with Phil in order to get him to stop. The car swerved dangerously and Phil was forced to stop at the next service station.\n\nPhil tried to explain the situation with the car-scam, saying that he only got involved to bail Roy Evans (Tony Caunter) out and it was just a favour. Ricky was furious that he could have been jailed for helping Phil. Ricky felt that there was nothing to go back to Walford for. He had lost his wife and son and was devastated that Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) was seeing another man. Ricky was also hurt because he had trusted Phil - he was the only thing that held him together over the last few weeks, but now he could no longer trust him. As he went to leave Phil chased him and tried to stop him leaving. However Ricky refused to let Phil push him around and informed Phil that he had purposefully driven his car into the back of the truck. Phil tried to reason that he had also lost his family. He had managed to turn his life around and Ricky could do the same. Phil tried to make Ricky think of the ramifications of his departure - Pat would dump Roy, Frank would go mad and run away again, and Phil would be dumped in it with the police. Ricky didn't care and as he began to walk off Phil shouted after him that everyone needs him to stay, and he was Ricky's friend and was there for him when he found out his unborn baby had spina bifida. The memory stirred up buried emotions in Ricky, and as he burst into tears Phil embraced him.\n\nAs dawn began to break Phil tried to coerce Ricky home by offering him partnership in The Arches. He promised to take the rap for the dodgy motor that Ricky was driving and to sort out his nemesis Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for him. Phil apologised for all the things he'd done to Ricky in the past, but wanted the chance to make it up to him, and turn things around. Ricky begrudgingly accepted, but when Phil left briefly to make a quick phone call Ricky decided that he couldn't return to Walford. While Phil's back was turned he asked a lorry driver for a lift and departed.\n\nThis episode featured Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and her daughter Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan), who up until this moment had lived her whole life thinking that Kat was her sister. Zoe announced that she was leaving Walford to go and live with her uncle Harry Slater (Michael Elphick) in Spain, but Kat was adamant that she was not. A screaming row ensued and when Zoe shouted \"You ain't my mother\", Kat's desperate reply was, \"Yes I am!\". 16.9 million viewers tuned in for this episode.\n\nThe episode began with Zoe still reeling from Kat's outburst. Back at the Slaters', Zoe demanded to know what Kat meant. Kat tried to take back what she had said, but after continuous pestering she finally relented and admitted that what she said was the truth. This devastated Zoe, and while she locked herself in her room distraught, Kat sat outside and began to explain the reason for the deception. She had fallen pregnant when she was 13, and her parents, disappointed and ashamed, forced her to hand Zoe over to them at birth. They proceeded to bring her up as their own child. Kat relayed her heartache at having to watch her own child being brought up by her parents, and the anxiety she felt at having to pretend that she was her sister for her whole life. The lies and deception were too much for Zoe, and when she discovered that Kat had wanted to abort her, the two lashed out at each other in fury.\n\nThe news made Zoe all the more determined to live with her uncle Harry in Spain, and upon hearing this Kat dropped her second bombshell - she couldn't go and live with Harry because he was her father. Kat's uncle had sexually abused her as a child, leaving her pregnant with Zoe. This meant that Zoe's father was simultaneously her great uncle.\n\nThis episode featured Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) and her step-grandmother Dot Branning (June Brown). Sonia had kidnapped the daughter she had given up for adoption and was keeping her hidden away at the Brannings'. Dot tried to reason with Sonia and shared a secret of her own.\n\nWith Rebecca Miller asleep upstairs, Sonia ransacked the house for money in order to make her getaway. Dot frantically knocked at the door, shouting that Rebecca's adoptive parents, Neil Miller (Robin Sneller) and Sue Miller (Victoria Willing), were going to call the police unless Sonia let her in. Sonia tried to deny Rebecca was there, but Dot knew otherwise and made it clear that she was there to retrieve the baby for the Millers. Sonia became distressed by this, arguing that as she was Rebecca's mother she can look after her. The Millers had given Dot a deadline, she had 15 minutes to persuade Sonia to surrender Rebecca or they would involve the police.\n\nSonia tried to explain herself. The Millers had planned to take Rebecca away without granting her a last visit. She was also upset at how much her baby had changed since she was born and she had decided that she wanted her back. Dot argued that she couldn't change her mind now that Rebecca had been adopted and she no longer had any rights as her mother. When Dot instructed Sonia to take Rebecca outside, she threatened to abscond with the baby. She begged Dot to stall the police so she could escape via the back door and was furious when Dot refused. Dot proceeded to point out that Sonia had missed out on 18 months of Rebecca's life and that she hardly knew her daughter now. Despite her pleas, Dot refused to help Sonia - and threatened to call the police herself if the kidnapping continued.\n\nSonia became inconsolable. Dot tried to reassure her that everything would be alright, she just needed some inner strength. Sonia became angry with Dot for living her life by the Bible and Dot was mortified when she threw the holy book across the room. Sonia wondered why Dot was so willing to help her criminal son Nick Cotton (John Altman), but wouldn't help her. Dot explained that she helped Nick because she had something to make up for. She had an abortion when she was 21 years old. Her husband Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock) had forced her to terminate the pregnancy against her wishes. Dot described how guilty she felt after the abortion. She thought she had put it all behind her until the christening gown was found buried in the garden of Mark Fowler's (Todd Carty) house. She wished she had kept the baby, now she's left feeling cold and empty. Sonia wondered whether she should have been a single mum like her own mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson). She relayed that Carol was furious about the adoption, but Dot reassured her that Rebecca would have a good life with the Millers.\n\nJust as the Millers decided to call the police, Rebecca began to cry. When Sonia was unable to console her she finally realised that it was time to give her up. Tearfully, she passed Rebecca over to her relieved parents.\n\nThis episode featured the ex-lovers Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). Sharon and Phil had a heart to heart about their troubled pasts. They laid ghosts to rest and agreed to move on with their lives.\n\nSharon and Phil were simultaneously having problems in their relationships. Sharon had fallen out with Tom Banks (Colm Ó Maonlaí), due to malicious stirring from his ex-wife Sadie, and Phil had given Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin) an ultimatum - she was to leave her husband Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) before the day was over. As Phil waited for Lisa to arrive in the middle of the night, he heard a knock at the door of The Queen Vic. He opened the door expecting to find Lisa, but found Sharon instead.\n\nSharon declared that she and Tom were over. Phil accused her of being stroppy and spoilt and she retaliated by accusing him of using Lisa so he could get his hands on their daughter, Louise Mitchell (Rachel Cox). The ex-lovers began drinking and flirting and talked about their past relationship. As they talked Phil relaxed and opened up about his father. Phil relayed how he idolised his father but that all changed when he saw how badly he treated his mother. He admitted that his deepest wish was to be a good father and expressed his sorrow that his two children were living with other men. Phil began to shake with emotion as he recalled the beatings he received from his father, whilst his brother Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) could do no wrong. After one horrific Christmas, Phil vowed to run away and he still carried the note he was going to leave his parents. He never did run away, but the violence continued until he was big enough to fight back. Sharon had also had issues with her parents. She loved them both, but was caught in the middle of their volatile marriage. After they rowed, they used to compete with each other for her affections.\n\nSharon then realised that they both had to stop living in the past. She decided to sell her share in The Vic as it reminded her of her parents and Grant. Phil agreed to buy her out. Sharon then urged Phil to put his troubled relationship with his father behind him. Their heart to heart helped her to realise that she wanted to make a go of things with Tom. As Sharon left, Phil took the note that he wrote when he was a boy out of his pocket. He set it on fire to signify that it was time for him to move on too.\n\nThis episode featured Little Mo Morgan (Kacey Ainsworth) and her abusive husband Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns). It was the night of Little Mo and Billy Mitchell's (Perry Fenwick) engagement party. Trevor snatched Little Mo from the party at \"Angie's Den\" and imprisoned her in the Slater house. To make matters worse, Trevor's baby son Sean was his other hostage.\n\nTrevor had imprisoned Little Mo in the Slater house. He called her stupid for believing he'd ever grant her a divorce. Ominously, he reminded her of their marriage vows - including \"till death us do part\". Trevor began to weep as he admitted he was totally obsessed with Little Mo. He was furious that she had been unfaithful to him with Billy and reminded her that she will always be his. Little Mo was disgusted and wondered how Trevor had ended up in such a pitiful state. The early years of their marriage had been happy - so why did Trevor start beating her? He explained that he couldn't stand sharing her and resented the time she spent caring for her sick mother. He never liked Viv, and was glad when she died. Trevor raged that it wasn't enough for him to be part of her family, he wanted to be all of it.\n\nTrevor then turned violent, pushed Little Mo against the wall and reminded her that he'd kill her if she ever slept with another man. Terrified, Little Mo tried to escape but found that all the doors were locked. She ran upstairs in a panic, but Trevor followed and threw her to the ground saying that she will never hurt him again. Half-crazed with anger, Trevor barked questions at Little Mo, forcing her to admit that it was morally wrong for her, as his wife, to sleep with another man. He claimed that Billy couldn't possibly love her like he did. His questions took on an intimate nature and as he made a move towards Little Mo she recoiled in fear, but Trevor then declared there was no time for that, he had other plans for her. After calmly leaving the room, Little Mo followed to find Trevor pouring petrol on the stairs and suddenly she heard baby Sean crying upstairs. Out of desperation, Little Mo claimed that she still loved Trevor and she had never wanted a divorce. Thinking fast, she blamed Billy for turning her against him. She tore off her engagement ring and threw it away. Trevor slumped to the ground, eager to believe that she still loved him. Little Mo beckoned to him and they embraced. As she cradled him in her arms he sobbed that he never meant to hurt her.\n\nLittle Mo suggested they go away together, but that she first needed to return Sean to his mother. When Trevor tried to get romantic, Little Mo shrieked and shook him off. Realising that he was being fooled, Trevor turned violent and Little Mo froze with fear, but seeing Billy's ring on the carpet gave her courage. She stared at Trevor and proclaimed that she wasn't frightened of him anymore. She told him that she could see him for what he was - a coward and a bully. Shocked at her defiance, Trevor whispered that she should be scared, but Little Mo was defiant and told him that he didn't have the guts to go through with his threat. She lit a match forcing an alarmed Trevor to grab it from her. In his haste the match fell to the floor and flames began to fill the room, Trevor was killed though Little Mo and the baby survived.\n\nThis episode featured Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin) and her ex-boyfriend Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). After Lisa abducted Phil's daughter and fled to Portugal, Phil tracked her down and was adamant that he was returning to Walford with his daughter.\n\nAfter fleeing from Phil, Lisa was trapped at the edge of a cliff grasping her daughter, Louise Mitchell (Rachel Cox). Phil implored her to move away from the cliff edge, but Lisa was terrified and yelled at Phil to get away from her. Phil stepped back and urged Lisa to consider Louise's safety and slowly, Lisa moved away from the edge.\n\nLisa saw a man walking his dog and shouted in vain for help. Her yelling made Louise cry and Lisa tried to calm her with a lullaby. Phil was biding his time and refused to leave without Louise. Lisa finally began to calm down so Phil led to her to an abandoned cottage so they could talk. As they settled inside Phil remarked how beautiful his daughter was, and paid the same compliment to Lisa. He told Lisa that he missed them both so much. Lisa was suspicious, but after continual pressure she allowed Phil to hold Louise.\n\nPhil tried to persuade Lisa that children need their fathers', and whilst Lisa admitted that she missed her own father she insisted that neither of them were going back with Phil. Phil tried to keep her talking, he questioned her about her father. Lisa confessed that she had a recurring dream involving her dad. As she recalled the dream, she becomes highly distraught and informed him that it involved coffins and babies. Phil found this disturbing and did his best to convince Lisa that she wasn't well. He offered to arrange the professional help that she obviously needed, but Lisa accused Phil of trying to trap her into returning to England. Phil immediately got defensive, he continued his mind games and managed to make Lisa consider that a life in Portugal, with an unskilled, jobless mother was not appropriate for their daughter. Phil fired question after question at Lisa, and the continual probing began to baffle Lisa. As he saw it, she had no money and no plans. It was not enough to merely love her daughter if she couldn't provide for her. He told her that babies need stability and their first year was hugely important. Lisa had moved from man to man, and from one place to another in that time. Distressed, Lisa put her hands over her ears, whilst Phil continued to rant that she was not fit to look after a dog let alone a baby! He declared that Lisa was mentally unstable and Lou was not safe with her. Phil urged Lisa to do what was best for her baby.\n\nExhausted by Phil's personal attacks, Lisa fell quiet. Phil then stated calmly that if she tried to stop him taking Louise, he'd have her committed. Lisa protested that the only mad thing she had ever done was get involved with him, but Phil proceeded to plants doubts in her mind. He reminded her that she shot him and left him for dead and asked if that was how a sane person behaved. Lisa was visibly distressed and shaking. Sensing that the moment was right, Phil ordered her to fetch Louise and hand her over to him. Bewildered, Lisa obeyed him. He then announced that it was best if Lisa didn't ever try to return to Walford. He was prepared to reveal all about the shooting if she did.\n\nLisa staggered outside in confusion and grief. Phil ignored her howls of anguish and walked away with Louise whilst Lisa stared over the edge of the cliff.\n\nThis episode reunited Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) with his adopted daughter Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), after she'd spent 14 years thinking that he was dead. Sharon had the shock of her life when her dad emerged from the shadows and muttered \"Hello, Princess!\". Sharon couldn't believe that her dad was still alive. Den did his best to explain where he'd been, but Sharon was torn between delight and anger.\n\nSharon touched Den, dumbstruck to see her dad after all these years, but before she had a chance to take it in she began to feel nauseous and ran to the toilet to be violently sick. Upon her return, Den proceeded to try to explain himself. Sharon stared in disbelief and wanted to know how he could let her think that he was dead all this time. As emotions began to run high, Sharon revealed that she'd never stopped grieving for him. Den explained that he couldn't take the risk in contacting her, or they would have both been in danger. Den only felt safe to return to Walford after hearing that Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett) - a gangster associated with his attempted murder - had died. He apologised to Sharon for never having the guts to get in touch. Sharon sobbed as she recalled the last conversation she ever had with him. She washed her hands of him, and the next thing she knew he was dead. She'd regretted her harsh words ever since, she thought he'd died thinking that she hated him. Sharon confessed that she'd made a mess of her life. Things would have been easier if he'd been around. Just his voice on the end of the phone would have helped. Den had tears in his eyes as he hugged Sharon.\n\nAs the two began to bond, Den brought the conversation round to his first wife, Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) and offended Sharon by referring to her as a \"barmy old lush\". Sharon announced that Angie had died. Den didn't even know. Furious, Sharon then decided it was too late for Den to make amends, and yelled at him to leave her alone. Den did as she wanted and wandered though the Square, before breaking into The Vic, the pub he used to own. Den surveyed the pub and Sharon followed him inside. They drank a toast to Angie and Sharon revealed how she nursed her mum during the painful final days of her fatal illness. Den reflected that he had some good times in the pub, but Sharon couldn't remember many good times – she just recalled her parents' furious rows. She mentioned how she once ran it with Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), whom Den had never even heard of. Sharon then remembered that she had an axe to grind with her father, for getting her best friend Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) pregnant when she was only 16. Den tried to explain what happened between him and Michelle, but Sharon was furious with him for cheating on her mother and blamed him for sending her to an early grave.\n\nSharon decided that she wasn't going to allow Den to ruin her life again. Den tried to calm her, but she insisted that she, Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Johnson) and Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) didn't need him. Den assumed that Dennis was Sharon's boyfriend and told her he wasn't important. Then Sharon revealed that he wasn't her boyfriend, Dennis was his son.\n\nThis episode featured Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman). Father and son went head to head in The Vic. Both were desperate to win the battle. It ended with violence, and one being the definite loser.\n\nDen had just discovered that his adopted daughter, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), was sleeping with his son. He was not happy. In The Vic, Den took Dennis aside for a chat. Dennis sat down with trepidation but was amazed that Den was so calm. He explained that he and Sharon were in love, but Den had doubts. With Dennis showing no signs of budging, Den reluctantly decided to that Dennis had to be forced away from Sharon rather than persuaded. When Dennis referred to their bonding chat last Christmas and that he was glad that Den now knew about him and Sharon, Den mocked him cruelly, claiming that their prior bonding was all an act. He was only pretending when he acted fatherly towards him and didn't care about him in the slightest. Dennis was hurt and taken aback and as Den belittled him further, remembering the way Dennis melted when he called him \"son\", Dennis became enraged. Den continued his diatribe on Dennis, threatening to inform Sharon that he had killed Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett), but it wasn't enough to scare Dennis off.\n\nDen continued to goad him, asking how long it would be before he turned his attentions to his biological sister Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Johnson) and Dennis was sickened by the remark. Den argued that Dennis couldn't tell the difference between female relatives and lovers. He taunted Dennis about his background, telling him that years of misery and abuse had turned him into the man that he was. Dennis managed to remain calm and was sure that Den was closer to losing his temper than he was. Dennis said he realised that they would always be at loggerheads with each other. He had let Den triumph before, because he thought he wanted a dad, but even though Den had put up a good fight, he wasn't going to let him win this time. Den became enraged and asserted that his and Sharon's affair was over. He ordered Dennis to leave, but Dennis replied repeatedly that he loved Sharon. Calmly, he prepared to head home to her. Seeing that he was losing the fight Den turned angry and hurled Dennis through the doors of The Vic. Father and son stood head to head, while Dennis bragged about Sharon leaving with him. Cockily, he shoved his father aside. Furious, Den spat out that some twisted pervert must have got to Dennis in the past, and caused him to think that a relationship with his own sister was acceptable. He described the abuse Dennis must have suffered in care and waved goodbye to the son he never wanted. Dennis finally snapped and lunged at him out of control, but was restrained. Eventually he broke free and lashed out, accidentally punching Sharon, who had just arrived, in the process. A victorious Den then took Sharon home.\n\nThis episode featured Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) and Alfie Moon (Shane Richie). Alfie had been given a video of Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) sleeping with his wife. Alfie owed Andy money and when he couldn't pay he Andy threatened his safety. Kat slept with Andy as a trade for her husband's life, but Alfie could not accept her excuses.\n\nThe episode began with a jovial Kat returning home, but her mood soon changed after she saw that Andy had filmed their sordid liaison and maliciously given it to Alfie to watch. Alfie was in pieces and couldn't bear to look at his wife. As Kat pleaded with Alfie to listen to her explanation, he refused, so Kat screamed that she did it all for him. Alfie was disgusted and called her a cheap little slapper. Hurt, Kat slapped Alfie and he slapped her right back, leaving Kat stunned that he could do such a thing.\n\nAs it all sunk in Alfie broke down in tears, whilst Kat desperately tried to protest that Andy tricked her. Alfie could only laugh at her feeble excuse. She told him that she did it to protect him and because she loved him, but Alfie felt hurt and betrayed. He suggested that she go back to Andy, as he didn't want her anywhere near him. Through his tears and anguish Alfie revealed the guilt he'd always carried about his parents' death in a car crash and how he blamed himself for not fixing something his dad asked him to. Now he can't live with the thought that his negligence ruined things again. He told Kat that their marriage was over and Kat had no choice but to pack her bags. As she was about to go Alfie questioned her more about her motives and Kat tried to make him realise that Andy's behaviour was all about revenge and that they can get past this and stay together. As Alfie continued to reject her, Kat turned on him and brought up her past sexual abuse at the hands of her uncle and likened it to her affair with Andy. Sobbing, she made one last attempt to change his mind and asked him to give her a cuddle. However, Alfie's pride wouldn't let him take her back and he showed her the door.\n\nAs Kat left The Vic in tears she heard the door open and saw Alfie there. She held out her hand and he took it. They agreed that it would be tough, but decided to try to find a way to work things out.\n\nThis episode featured long-time neighbours, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and Dot Branning (June Brown). Den's wife had left him following his affair, and his relationship with his son was in tatters after he propositioned his girlfriend. Meanwhile, Dot was arguing with her husband, Jim Branning (John Bardon) and was very reluctant to tell him about her secret cancer illness. Den and Dot forced each other to examine their relationships with others.\n\nLate one evening Den spotted some youths vandalising the launderette. After seeing off the thugs, Dot emerged from the back room and Den could see that she had been crying.\n\nDot began to engage Den in conversation about his wife Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman) and how he felt now that she had left him. Den's response was blasé, which angered Dot and she accused him of putting up a front. Dot chastised Den for his demeanour and pointed out that he couldn't face up to his own guilt. She told him that he treated his friends and family appallingly and when he had heard enough and turned to leave, he found that Dot had locked him in and refused to give him the keys. As Den was forced to continue the conversation Dot pestered him more about Chrissie and threatened to haunt him if he didn't plead Chrissie for forgiveness.\n\nEventually, Dot informed Den that she was dying and he was shocked to hear that she had kidney cancer. However Dot became cagey when Den quizzed her about her illness. He wanted her to have the best care possible and even offered to pay for it, but Dot rejected his help - she had chosen not to have her cancer treated. She wanted to face death with dignity and begged Den to keep her secret quiet as even her husband, Jim, didn't know she was suffering.\nDen wasn't convinced by Dot's motives for keeping her illness from Jim, but she believed that she was acting in his best interests. Den insisted that Dot's deceit would destroy her marriage and told her to open up to Jim. Den then slyly told her that if she didn't come clean with Jim, she couldn't take the moral high ground next time he messed up. They both decided that they needed to sort their marriages out.\n\nWhen Jim arrived to collect Dot, Den explained that she was sorting him out and squeezed Dot's hand tenderly before leaving. At home Den apologised to his son and heeding Dot's advice, he bit the bullet and called Chrissie. Meanwhile, Dot took Den's advice and decided that it was time to come clean to Jim.\n\nFollowing Stacey Branning's (Lacey Turner) confession to her father-in-law Max Branning (Jake Wood) that she murdered Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) (see Who Killed Archie?, the two characters featured in a two-hander episode on 26 March 2010. The killer was kept a secret from all the cast until 30 minutes before a live episode was broadcast on 19 February 2010, meaning that the script for the two-hander episode, written by Simon Ashdown, could not be released until after the broadcast, though later episodes had already been completed. The cast had been told there was a special episode coming up, but that it would actually feature three characters, one being Archie's murderer. Wood described Ashdown's script as \"amazing\", saying that Ashdown knows the characters inside out, and hoped he could do the script justice. Wood and Turner were given three days to rehearse. One 19-minute scene took up 26 pages in the script, and was filmed in two takes. The entire episode was filmed in three night shoots and one studio shoot. It was originally scheduled to be filmed over three days, but a fourth day was added for on-location filming. Some night-time location filming was done on 9 March 2010.\n\nThe episode follows on from the previous episode where Max discovers where his daughter-in-law Stacey is staying after the death of her husband, Bradley (Charlie Clements), and her confession to the murder of Archie. Max goes up to her flat and enters, pressing her for details of Archie's murder, the night of Bradley's death and what she had done in her absence. Stacey reveals that after she fled the morgue, she contemplated suicide but could not bring herself to do it for the sake of her unborn child; she then went to her mother's old flat which was deserted and did not move for three days; eventually leaving to buy food and drink. Max tells her that he wants to hand her in to the police. Max then chases Stacey outside, where she trips and he catches her. He then drags Stacey to a car, which he breaks into and bundles her into. He then hot-wires the car and drives to a police station. After telling Stacey that she must confess to her mother and the Mitchells first, he drives her back to Walford where he eventually changes his mind after expressing that Bradley would want her to be happy. The episode ends with them both entering their respective houses and the camera panning up over Walford, rising so high that it morphs into the \"EastEnders\" credits.\n\nThis episode features Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell) revealing to her best friend Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) her reasons for returning to the United Kingdom after 20 years. Although their scenes are interspersed with scenes of Dot Branning (June Brown) at home waiting for her cat, and the episode credits 20 characters, it was officially considered a two-hander by BBC Store and was included in their \"\"EastEnders\": Two's Company\" collection of two-hander episodes.\n\nDuring this episode, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) explains to Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) why he has given him the car lot, which is worth £300,000 rather than giving it to his son Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), who received the lesser valued Arches. Phil tells Jay that Jase Dyer (Stephen Lord) was not his biological father as he didn't know Jay's mother until two months after his birth. Phil tells Jay that a tramp living rough around Albert Square, named Alan Hall, was his birth father and that in an insurance scam back in 1994 he and Frank Butcher (Mike Reid) committed arson to the car lot and that they weren't aware Alan was sleeping in one of the cars within. Phil attempts to persuade Jay that there would be no point in going to prison because he is still paying for the crime in the form of guilt. At the end of the episode Jay is seen sat at \"Jase's bench\" while Phil is seen making a phone call to an unknown person, he tells them that he's \"done it\" and \"fed him [Jay] a pack of lies and that it's now their turn to keep to the deal\".\n\n\"EastEnders\" is also notable for featuring three and four-hander episodes. Within three-hander episodes three characters usually interact separately with each other in differing scenes, whilst four-handers often include two sets of characters stories which occur simultaneously, although they are not directly connected to each other there is usually a linking theme.\n\n\n\n\n\"EastEnders\" had its first (and only to date) single-hander episode which featured only one character; Dot Cotton in the entire episode. The episode saw Dot recording a cassette tape of memories for her husband Jim and was written by Tony Jordan. The episode was shown on 31 January 2008, and was watched by 8.7 million viewers. Instead of the usual theme music, the credits had the song \"Pretty Baby\" playing over them, as it was referenced in the episode. The episode was also titled \"Pretty Baby...\"\n\nIn March 2009, actress June Brown was nominated for the Best TV Actress award at the British Academy Television Awards for her portrayal of Dot in this episode.\n\n\"EastEnders\" two-handers have since been emulated in other British soap operas, notably \"Coronation Street\" and \"Brookside\"\n\n"}

{"id": "48896673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48896673", "title": "Martha Ellen Davis", "text": "Martha Ellen Davis\n\nMartha Ellen Davis is an emeritus professor from the University of Florida, anthropologist and ethnomusicologist known for her multifarious work on African diasporic religion and music. Professor Davis' research has defied conventional tenets about Haitian and Dominican folk music, and her cultural preservation projects has raised awareness of the significance of the Samaná Americanos' enclave.\n\nDavis received her B.A. (Magna Cum Laude) in Anthropology from the University of California and a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois. Her graduate field work took her to various Caribbean islands, of which she has published, but it was in the Dominican Republic where early on in her graduate career she established her reputation as an iconoclast, critic and dedicated scholar to Black culture. In 1972, she arrived at the island of Hispaniola with the suspicion that Dominicans owned more to the Afro-Caribbean culture than what had been documented yet. In an article published in a leading Dominican newspaper, Xiomarita Perez wrote candidly about Davis' style and links to the country: \"Martha works from the heart and with the heart... Her job is essential to the country's social memory\" (Spanish:«Martha trabaja de corazón y con el corazón... Su oficio es delicado e importante para la memoria social del país»).\n\nPart of Davis' legacy includes co-founding the Committee of Applied Ethnomusicology within the Society for Ethnomusicology in 1998, writing four seminal books, producing documentaries, and writing numerous scientific articles. She has been considered an authority in Afro-Caribbean music and is quoted extensively in the literature. Davis' book, \"La otra ciencia\", earned the National Nonfiction Award of the Dominican Republic. While continuing as an affiliate professor at the University of Florida, since ca. 2003 Davis has spent most of her time in the Dominican Republic as honorary researcher of the Museo del Hombre Dominicano (Museum of the Dominican Man) and oral-history expert and researcher of the Archivo General de la Nación (The National Archives), offering lectures, advising young scholars, and writing. In November 1, 2012, the Museo celebrated her 40 years of research in the country.\n\nDavis' long-standing interest in the Dominican and Haitian cultures derives from her belief that \"The island of Hispaniola—the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo and first colony in the New World—was the initial diasporal crucible and cultural bridge of the Americas.\" In 1976, Davis, who rivals Fernando Ortiz in years of research into Afro-Caribbean culture, challenged the Dominican cultural establishment. According to Peter Manuel from CUNY, she convincingly suggested \"that if there is any rightful ‘national’ music of the Dominican Republic, it would be not the Merengue, with its specifically regional origin in the Cibao, but rather the various types of \"salve\", which have flourished throughout the country.\" Her work has also crossed into the realm of religion, and here she also suggested that what is commonly called Dominican \"Folk Religion\" is more accurately described as folk Catholicism of which one component is \"Dominican Vodou.\"\n\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "13690215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13690215", "title": "Mockbuster", "text": "Mockbuster\n\nA mockbuster (also known as knockbuster or a drafting opportunity) is a movie created with the intention of exploiting the publicity of another major motion picture with a similar title or subject. Mockbusters are often made with a low budget and quick production to maximize profit. Unlike films that are produced to capitalize on the popularity of a recent release by adopting similar genre or storytelling elements, mockbusters are generally produced concurrently with upcoming films, and released direct-to-video at the same time the real film reaches theaters or video outlets. A mockbuster may be similar enough in title, packaging, etc. in hopes that consumers confuse it with the actual film it mimics, but their producers maintain that they are simply offering additional products for consumers who want to watch additional films in the same subgenres.\n\n\"Mockbuster\" is a portmanteau combining the words \"mock\" with \"blockbuster.\"\n\nMockbusters have a long history in Hollywood and elsewhere. For example, the 1959 Vanwick film \"The Monster of Piedras Blancas\" was a clear derivative of \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\", complete with a creature suit by the same designer, Jack Kevan. \"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\" spawned \"Village of the Giants\"; \"The Land That Time Forgot\" spawned \"Legend of Dinosaurs & Monster Birds\".\n\nSuch films tend to fit the classic B movie model, produced on a small budget and derivative of the target film and other similar projects. The reduced costs made available by using modern video and computer graphics equipment, and the tie-in to the mainstream film's advertising, has allowed the mockbuster to find a profitable niche in the home video market. Blockbuster, at one time one of the largest DVD and video game rental chains, gave implied support to the concept by buying 100,000 copies of The Asylum's version of \"War of the Worlds\" in time to coincide with the theatrical opening week of Steven Spielberg's film based on the same novel starring Tom Cruise.\n\nMost mockbusters capitalize on the popularity of theatrically released movies, but some are derivative of a TV series or other popular form of media. The 1979 film \"Angels Revenge\" bore many superficial similarities to the popular TV series \"Charlie's Angels;\" its promotional materials even resembled \"Charlie's Angels\"' graphic style.\n\nGoodTimes Entertainment was notorious for distributing animated \"mockbuster\" counterparts to popular Disney films in the 1990s (such as those made by Golden Films); because Disney was creating its films based on public domain folk tales and historical stories, GoodTimes' actions were completely legal and survived Disney's legal challenge against it. Similarly, Vídeo Brinquedo is a Brazilian CGI animation studio that in 2006 began to produce low-budget direct-to-video films that are for the most part knockoffs of movies from Pixar, Disney, and DreamWorks. Their titles and the films they are considered to be derivative of include \"Little & Big Monsters\" (DreamWorks' \"Monsters vs. Aliens\"), \"The Little Cars\" series of cartoons (Pixar's \"Cars\" series), \"Ratatoing\" (Pixar's \"Ratatouille\"), \"Tiny Robots\" (Pixar's \"WALL-E\"), \"What's Up?: Balloon to the Rescue!\" (Pixar's \"Up\"), and \"The Frog Prince\" (Disney's \"The Princess and the Frog\"). In every case Vídeo Brinquedo's knockoffs has been released suspiciously close to the release date of the more professional, higher-budgeted film that inspired it.\n\nDingo Pictures, a German animation company based in Friedrichsdorf, also created traditionally-animated cartoons based on fairy tales and concepts similar to those used by Disney, Pixar and DreamWorks. These cartoons are characterized by low-budget animation, small voice casts, and character designs that are very similar to equivalent characters in more high-profile movies. The cartoons have also been dubbed into Scandinavian languages notably Swedish, and also into Romance languages, notably Italian, and all of them have been released direct-to-video in Germany in their original languages. A company called Phoenix Games collaborated with Dingo Pictures in the early 2000s to produce interactive video game versions of some of their films for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2. These games included the film as well as a small collection of mini games. Phoenix Games went out of business in 2009.\n\nThe 2011 film \"Aliens vs Avatars\" was named to market it as a crossover to \"Alien\" and \"Avatar,\" even though it has no connection with the two films. The film follows the intergalactic battle between a quarrelsome alien race and shape-shifting extraterrestrials, while six college friends find themselves in the middle of the interstellar war.\n\nA 1993 science fiction horror film titled \"Carnosaur,\" produced by Roger Corman and starring Diane Ladd as a mad scientist who plans to recreate dinosaurs and destroy humanity, is loosely based on the 1984 novel of the same name by John Brosnan, but the two have little in common. It was released by New Horizon Picture Corp two weeks before the blockbuster \"Jurassic Park.\" \"Carnosaur\" may be considered a mockbuster. Diane Ladd's daughter Laura Dern starred in \"Jurassic Park\".\n\nIn some cases, the knockoff film may bear little or no resemblance to the original. In 2012, \"Super K – The Movie\", an Indian fantasy/science-fiction animated film about an artificially created boy named \"Super Kloud\" with superpowers, was released direct-to-video in the United States as \"Kiara the Brave\". Its title and cover art focused on an incidental female character with red hair (i.e. Merida), in an obvious attempt to evoke the redheaded female protagonist of \"Brave\", a Disney/Pixar movie set in medieval Scotland.\n\nIn other cases, the knockoff film simply renames an already existing film into a name that is similar to a popular film. For example, \"The Legend of Sarila\" was renamed \"Frozen Land\" to cash in on Disney's 2013 film, \"Frozen\". In another case, a collection of animated shorts from the 90s animated series, \"Britannica's Tales Around the World\", was rereleased under \"Tangled Up\" by Brightspark to cash in on Disney's 2010 film, \"Tangled\".\n\nAsylum CEO David Michael Latt responds to criticisms about loose plot lines by stating that \"We don't have spies at the studios. We have a general sense of what the film is and we make our movie completely original, just based on that concept.\"\n\nMockbusters are low budget, and their revenue is based entirely on the sales of their DVDs. Low budgets also mean that directors need to think of creative yet cheap ways to achieve the endings that they desire. For example, \"Snakes on a Train\" capitalized on the Internet hype surrounding \"Snakes on a Plane\". Consumers wanted what they saw. Latt said, \"With only four days left of shooting my partner called and said everyone is really excited about \"Snakes on a Train\", but they’re more excited about the poster, which showed a snake swallowing a train. It was meant to be, you know, metaphorical. But the buyers wanted it, so I was given the mandate that the ending had to have the snake eat the train.\" At the same time another representative of Asylum, David Rimawi, says that while a handful of their movies do have \"artistic elements\", that's just not something they're concerned with. The Asylum does not claim to be an \"artsy\" production house.\n\nMockbusters often use a title with a similar-sounding name to the mainstream feature it intends to piggy-back upon. For instance, the 2006 mockbuster \"Snakes on a Train\" traded on the publicity surrounding the theatrically released \"Snakes on a Plane\". Besides the aforementioned film, The Asylum has also released \"The Land That Time Forgot\", \"Transmorphers\", \"\", \"The Da Vinci Treasure\", \"Battle of Los Angeles\", \"Atlantic Rim\" and \"Paranormal Entity\".\n\nMockbusters and ripoffs are often filmed and released outside of the original movie's country. Low-budget studios in foreign countries may produce completely illegitimate sequels to pre-existing higher budgeted movie series that began in other countries. These sequels are unofficial, and often even unknown to the creators and producers of the original films. These unofficial sequels are rarely, or never, released in the original country, usually due to licensing issues. In other cases, a film released in other countries is renamed as a sequel to another film in contrast to the original title.\n\nTwo Italian directors directed unofficial sequels to George A. Romero's 1978 \"Dawn of the Dead\": Lucio Fulci's \"Zombi 2\" sold itself as the sequel to that film (which was called \"Zombi\" in Italy) and even used a line originally written for \"Dawn of the Dead\".\n\nThe Philippine film industry is also known for its unauthorised adaptations of popular Western films. The popularity of the \"Batman\" films, most especially the 1966 TV series, has led to numerous unauthorised remakes and pastiches, such as \"James Batman\" starring comedian Dolphy, \"Batman Fights Dracula\", and \"Alyas Batman en Robin\". Dolphy also played leading roles in other mockbusters, including \"Wanted: Perfect Father\", a comedy-drama based on the 1993 film \"Mrs. Doubtfire\", and \"Tataynic\", a 1998 parody of James Cameron's \"Titanic\". Other Filipino knockoffs include \"Bobo Cop\" (a parody of \"RoboCop\") and \"Rocky Plus V\" (a spoof of the \"Rocky\" series).\n\nMockbusters based on popular animated films are known as a \"drafting opportunity.\" For example, \"Kiara the Brave\" (a mockbuster of Pixar's \"Brave\") and \"Puss in Boots: A Furry Tale\" (a mockbuster of \"Puss in Boots\") use soundalike titling to \"draft off\" the marketing success (\"slipstream\") of popular films. \"Can you trademark an actual noun? The idea of a battleship?,\" asks Boxoffice magazine editor Amy Nicholson. The original \"Puss in Boots\" was made by DreamWorks Animation by 300 people working for four years at the cost of $130 million. The mockbuster, with nearly exactly the same name was made by 12 people, in six months, for less than $1 million. For these large production houses, it wasn't just a question of free riding on the marketing success of these more popular films; mockbusters have become a source of bad publicity. Customers who had accidentally bought the mockbuster \"Puss in Boots: A Furry Tale\" but did not know that it was a mockbuster gave the original movie bad reviews. Mockbuster producers have had no legal troubles with drafting off as a result of Disney losing a case against GoodTimes Entertainment, which had used similar packaging for their own version of \"Aladdin\".\n\nMockbusters have also had legal complications with false advertising. They supposedly tweak the plot lines and the titles just enough to skirt legal trouble and yet ride on the publicity of major blockbusters. Until the \"Hobbit\" case, mockbuster production houses have been able to achieve soundalike titling to such an extent that even actors in the movies have been confused about which movie they are starring in. Some actors starring in the original have gone on to become fans of the mockbuster model. Kel Mitchell was the star in the mockbuster \"Battle of Los Angeles\", the mockbuster to the original \"\". His friend was in the original and they began promoting both movies together. Kel has since then became a fan of the studio's formula: \"I laugh out loud when I see that a film is coming out; I wonder what The Asylum is going to do with it. They're going to remix that name and put it out.\"\n\nIn December 2013, The Walt Disney Company filed in California federal court to get an injunction against the continued distribution of the French film \"The Legend of Sarila\", retitled \"Frozen Land\". In their suit, Disney alleges: \"To enhance the commercial success of Sarila, the defendant redesigned the artwork, packaging, logo, and other promotional materials for its newly (and intentionally misleadingly) retitled film to mimic those used by [Disney] for \"Frozen\" and related merchandise.\" The suit was filed against distributor Phase 4 Films.\n\nBecause mockbusters are deliberately similar to more famous movies, some movie studios have sued mockbuster studios for allegedly tricking consumers into renting or purchasing the wrong movie through intentionally deceptive marketing.\n\nIn one such lawsuit, Walt Disney Pictures sued the U.K.-based studio Brightspark, complaining that the studio was \"misleading consumers with numerous releases that confuse and undermine the trust those consumers have in Disney.\" Among Brightspark's films mentioned in the lawsuit were \"Braver\", \"Tangled Up\", \"The Frog Prince\", and \"Little Cars\", which resemble Disney's \"Brave\", \"Tangled\", \"The Princess and the Frog\", and \"Cars\", respectively.\n\nWarner Bros. similarly sued The Asylum over their release of \"Age of the Hobbits\". The judge ruled in favor of Warner Bros., writing that \"There is substantial likelihood that consumers will be confused by Age Of Hobbits and mistakenly purchase the film intending to purchase \"\".\n\nMost mockbusters follow the trend of releasing their movies close to the release dates of the original:\n\nThe Asylum defend this practice, stating their intention is not to dupe customers. The Asylum cites reports from both Blockbuster LLC and Hollywood Video that show that less than 1% of customers who rent one of their films ask for a refund. The fact that the low return rate of their films has been used to argue that consumers are renting The Asylum's movies deliberately. \"There's a segment of people who watch them because they know they're bad and they're funny, and they're fun to make fun of with their friends,\" says Kyle Ryan, the managing editor of \"The A.V. Club\", a sister publication of \"The Onion\".\n\nIn 2012, Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, WingNut Films, and The Saul Zaentz Company (SZC) sued The Asylum for trademark infringement, false designation of origin, trademark dilution, false advertising, and unfair competition. Plaintiffs alleged that defendant's movie title \"Age of the Hobbits\" infringed the registered trademarks held by SZC in the designation \"Hobbit.\" Unlike fairytales, which are in the public domain, the J. R. R. Tolkien novels have been exclusively licensed to Warner Bros. and SZC for production and film adaptation. The court described Global Asylum (the defendant in this case) as a low budget company that makes \"mockbusters\" of popular movies with similar titling. Warner Bros. and SZC submitted evidence to prove that consumers would be confused by the identical title and that they would lose not only ticket sales but also DVD revenue. The evidence included a survey showing that 48 percent of 400 surveyed respondents associated the term “Hobbit” with SZC, d/b/a “Tolkien Enterprises” and Tolkien properties. A separate survey conducted by Nielsen National Research Group showed that approximately 16 to 24 percent of survey respondents were confused about the source of \"Age of the Hobbits\".\n\nThe Asylum claimed that they were justified in using the word \"Hobbit\" as a fair use of scientific terminology after some scientists borrowed the term from the \"Hobbit\" stories a few years prior to describe a human subspecies in Indonesia. The Asylum argued that it provided warnings stating that this was not the Tolkien creature. The films also featured major plot differences: \"In an ancient age, the small, peace-loving Hobbits are enslaved by the Java Men, a race of flesh-eating dragon-riders. The young Hobbit Goben must join forces with their neighbor giants, the humans, to free his people and vanquish their enemies.\"\n\nThe Federal Court found that Warner Bros. had a valid trademark on the word \"Hobbit\". The court rejected The Asylum's scientific fair use claims since there was no evidence to suggest that the movie was about prehistoric group of people who lived in Indonesia. The court rejected all of The Asylum's defenses: (i) that it was permitted to use “Hobbits” in the title of its film pursuant to the free speech test of the Second Circuit’s decision in \"Rogers v. Grimaldi\", (ii) that its use of the mark constituted nominative fair use to indicate plaintiffs' movies and (iii) that the “Hobbits” mark was a generic name. The court decided that The Asylum had failed to prove its defenses and on December 10, 2012, found in favor of the plaintiffs and entered a temporary restraining order. This restraining order prevented the use by Global Asylum of the title \"Age of the Hobbits\". The Ninth Circuit court of appeals affirmed in 2013. The film was then released under the name \"Clash of the Empires\".\n\nSuccessful films frequently spawn pornographic knock-offs with punned titles. Examples include: \"Gilligan's Bi-Land\" (\"Gilligan's Island\"), \"Edward Penishands\" (\"Edward Scissorhands\"), \"Kinky Kong\" (\"King Kong\"), \"Foreskin Gump\" (\"Forrest Gump\"), \"Raiders of the Lost Arse\" (\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"), \"Flesh Gordon\" (\"Flash Gordon\"), and \"The Devil in Miss Jones\" (\"The Devil and Miss Jones\").\n\nSome pornographic movies are mockbusters of other pornographic movies. For example, the 1985 film \"Black Throat\" is a mockbuster of an earlier, popular pornographic film, 1972's \"Deep Throat\". Pornographic films are particularly prone to unauthorized sequels; \"Debbie Does Dallas\", a 1978 porn film, spawned at least eleven sequels, most of which were never explicitly authorized by the original production team or cast.\n\nThe term has also been used for media besides film, such as video games capitalizing on the success of a known franchise like \"Grand Theft Auto\" or \"Call of Duty\". A notable example of this are games developed by the French studio Gameloft. Most of the games in their portfolio bear similarities to popular video game series, with reviewers commenting about \"Gameloft\"’s emulation of those games experiences brought onto mobile platforms.\n\n\n"}

Pasillo is a genre of indigenous Latin music. It is extremely popular in Ecuador, where it is the \"national genre of music.\" Pasillo as a genre is also present in the highland regions of Colombia and to a lesser extent, Panama and Venezuela.\n\nToday, it has incorporated more European features of classical dance, such as waltz. As it spread during the Gran Chaco period, pasillo also absorbed the individual characteristics of isolated villages. This gives it an eclectic feel; however, the style, tone, and tempo of the music differ in each village.\n\nIn its waltz, pasillo alters the classically European dance form to accompany guitar, mandolin, and other string instruments.\n\nThe pacific coast of Ecuador is known for the Amorfino, a popular type of song, as well as a variety of dance music.\n\nPasillo, Pasacalle, and Yarabi are popular styles of folksong. the latter being similar to a flute, and is usually downtempo; it is descended from the waltz. Pasacalle is a form of dance music, while the sentimental Yarabi is probably the most popular form in Ecuador.\n\nThe mountainous, Andean region of Ecuador, the Sierra, is home to a style of music called . The music of the Otavalo people is well known worldwide. A small panpipe called the \"rondador\" is the most distinctive instrument, but ensembles are typically groups of wind instruments, guitar trios, or brass bands. Folk rhythms include \"cachullapi\", \"yumbo\", and danzante.\nMusicians like Huayanay have helped to popularize Andean-Ecuadoran music.\n\nAfro-Ecuadorian music is mainly of two types. \"Marimba\" music comes from Esmeraldas, and gets its name from the prominent use of \"marimba\"s, along with drums and other instruments specific to this region such as the \"bombo\", the \"cununo\" and the \"wasa\". Sometimes this music is played in religious ceremonies, as well as in celebrations and parties. It features call and response chanting along with the music. Some of the rhythms associated with it are \"currulao\", \"bambuco\" and \"andarele\".\n\nOn the other hand, in the Chota Valley there is \"bomba\" music. This music is very different from \"marimba\", having a more prominent Spanish, \"mestizo\" and indigenous influence. It can vary from mid tempo to a very fast rhythm. It is usually played with guitars, as well as the main local instrument called \"bomba\", which is a drum, along with a \"guiro\", and sometimes \"bombos\" and \"bongos\". A variation of it played by \"la banda mocha\", groups who play \"bomba\" with a \"bombo\", \"guiro\" and plant leaves to give melody. Soca music is popular in Esmeraldas \n\nReligious practice among afro-Ecuadorians is usually Roman Catholic. There is no significant African religion, although Catholic worship is distinctive in Esmeraldas, and sometimes is done with \"marimba\" music.\n\n\nThe Fundación de Desarrollo Social Afroecuatoriano (AZUCAR) has existed since 1993, and offers a variety of workshops for all ages in music and dance, as well as handicrafts and other topics. More information can be found on their website here.\n\nEcuador has many annual festivals, with nearly every village celebrating a Roman Catholic Saint. The annual festival in August held in San Antonio de Pichincha is particularly well known, as is the independent music festival Quito Fest.\n\n"}

In Great Britain they occur in a variety of situations. In Scotland there are references to Nine Maidens, purportedly a group of, and there were a number of wells dedicated to them, but like all similar groupings would appear to have had their origin in pre-Christian times. In Arthurian material, the best known of these groups are the Nine sorceresses, Morgan and her sisters who live on the Isle of Avalon and are both seeresses and healers. Another group occur in the Welsh tale of Peredur son of Efrawg, and these are the armed witches of Caer Lyow. Also in Welsh mythology, we have nine maidens who tend the fire below the Cauldron of the \"Chief of Annwfn\"; this cauldron is the target of Arthur’s raid on the Underworld in Taliesin’s famous poem Preiddeu Annwfn.\n\nGroups of Nine Maidens crop up in the Icelandic tales of Thidrandi and in Brand’s saga, in the story of Svipdagr, as Valkyries and as the daughters of the sea goddess Rán.\n\nIn Norse mythology, the watcher god of Valhalla, Heimdallr is said to be born of nine mothers, and they are also associated with the World-Mill which created the known universe from the bodies of the Ice Giants slain by Odin and his companions.\n\nThe sea-god Njörðr and the jotun Ægir (whose domain is also the sea) each have nine daughters.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Charm Against a Kernel refers to a character called Noðþe with nine sisters.\n\nAn echo of the daughters of Rán appears in the Irish tale of Ruad, Son of Rig-Donn, in which he is stopped at sea by nine giant maidens with whom he has a child.\n\nIn Ireland, the attendants at St Brigid’s sacred fire at Kildare are sometimes said to be nine, though sometimes nineteen. Brigid also is said to have gone to Scotland with Nine Maidens to found Abernethy, just as Monenna is said to have come from Ireland with nine female companions. St Brigid appears to have been modelled on the earlier goddess figure Brìde, who was also indigenous to Scotland and may well have been the tutelary goddess of the Brigantes in North West England. \n\nBeyond Britain, the nine occur in the Breton story of the Korrigan, who along with her nine attendants lured unwary men to their deaths and in the tradition of the Gallicenae; the Nine Maidens who lived on the Isle du Sein, latterly known as the Isle of the Druidesses.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the Muses were originally thought to have been a whole series of different groups who, like their counterparts in Scotland, are associated with mountains and wells. Robert Graves in \"The Greek Myths\" drew attention to a similarity between groups of ecstatic Maenads and the cave painting form El Cogul Roca Dels Moros near Lerida in Catalonia which has nine women dancing round a spectacularly priapic male.\n\nIn Kenya, the Kikuyu people claim descent from nine sisters who, like many other such groupings, are associated with a mountain – Mount Kilimanjaro - and a single powerful male figure.\n\nBrìde – goddess in England, Ireland and Scotland who was the origin of the Irish St Brigid\n\nCailleach – The Winter Hag aspect of the Mother Goddess in Scotland. Similarly known in Ireland\n\nCerridwen – the Welsh Goddess who had a cauldron of poetry and inspiration\n\nMonenna – an early Scottish saint who supposedly had chapels on Dumbarton, Edinburgh and Stirling Rocks, and Traprain Law – all important Dark Age sites.\n\nMorgan - the leader of the nine sisters of Avalon linked to King Arthur.\n\nRán - Norse goddess of the sea\n\n"}
{"id": "172069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172069", "title": "Odds", "text": "Odds\n\nOdds are a numerical expression, usually expressed as a pair of numbers, used in both gambling and statistics. In statistics, the odds for or odds of some event reflect the likelihood that the event will take place, while odds against reflect the likelihood that it will not. In gambling, the odds are the ratio of payoff to stake, and do not necessarily reflect exactly the probabilities. Odds are expressed in several ways (see below), and sometimes the term is used incorrectly to mean simply the probability of an event. Conventionally, gambling odds are expressed in the form \"X to Y\", where X and Y are numbers, and it is implied that the odds are odds against the event on which the gambler is considering wagering. In both gambling and statistics, the 'odds' are a numerical expression of the likelihood of some possible event.\n\nIn gambling, odds represent the ratio between the amounts staked by parties to a wager or bet. Thus, odds of 6 to 1 mean the first party (normally a bookmaker) stakes six times the amount staked by the second party. In simplest terms, 6 to 1 odds means if you bet a dollar (the \"1\" in the expression), and you win you get paid six dollars (the \"6\" in the expression), or 6 x 1. If you bet two dollars you would be paid twelve dollars, or 6 x 2. If you bet three dollars and win, you would be paid eighteen dollars, or 6 x 3. If you bet one hundred dollars and win you would be paid six hundred dollars, or 6 x 100. If you lose any of those bets you would lose the dollar, or two dollars, or three dollars, or one hundred dollars.\n\nIn statistics, the odds for an event E are defined as a simple function of the probability of that possible event E. One drawback of expressing the uncertainty of this possible event as odds for is that to regain the probability requires a calculation. The natural way to interpret odds for (without calculating anything) is as the ratio of events to non-events in the long run. A simple example is that the (statistical) odds for rolling a three with a fair die (one of a pair of dice) are 1 to 5. This is because, if one rolls the die many times, and keeps a tally of the results, one expects 1 three event for every 5 times the die does not show three (i.e., a 1, 2, 4, 5 or 6). For example, if we roll the fair die 600 times, we would very much expect something in the neighborhood of 100 threes, and 500 of the other five possible outcomes. That is a ratio of 100 to 500, or simply 1 to 5. To express the (statistical) odds against, the order of the pair is reversed. Hence the odds against rolling a three with a fair die are 5 to 1. The probability of rolling a three with a fair die is the single number 1/6, roughly 0.17.\n\nThe gambling and statistical uses of odds are closely interlinked. If a bet is a fair one, then the odds offered to the gamblers will perfectly reflect relative probabilities. A fair bet that a fair die will roll a three will pay the gambler $5 for a $1 wager (and return the bettor his or her wager) in the case of a three and nothing in any other case. The terms of the bet are fair, because on average, five rolls result in something other than a three, at a cost of $5, for every roll that results in a three and a net payout of $5. The profit and the expense exactly offset one another and so there is no advantage to gambling over the long run. If the odds being offered to the gamblers do not correspond to probability in this way then one of the parties to the bet has an advantage over the other. Casinos, for example, offer odds that place themselves at an advantage, which is how they guarantee themselves a profit and survive as businesses. The fairness of a particular gamble is more clear in a game involving relatively pure chance, such as the ping-pong ball method used in state lotteries in the United States. It is much harder to judge the fairness of the odds offered in a wager on a sporting event such as a football match.\n\nThe language of odds, such as the use of phrases like \"ten to one\" for intuitively estimated risks, is found in the sixteenth century, well before the development of probability theory. Shakespeare wrote:\n\nThe sixteenth-century polymath Cardano demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes. Implied by this definition is the fact that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nOdds are expressed in the form formula_1 to formula_2, where formula_1 and formula_2 are numbers. Usually, the word \"to\" is replaced by a symbol for ease of use. This is conventionally either a slash or hyphen, although a colon is sometimes seen. Thus, formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7 are all interchangeable.\n\nWhen the probability that the event will not happen is greater than the probability that it will, then the odds are \"against\" that event happening. Odds of 6 to 1, for example, are therefore sometimes said to be \"6 to 1 \"against\"\". To a gambler, \"odds against\" means that the amount he or she will win is greater than the amount staked.\n\n\"Odds on\" is the opposite of \"odds against\". It means that the event is more likely to happen than not. This is sometimes expressed with the smaller number first (1 to 2) but more often using the word \"on\" (\"2 to 1 \"on\"\"), meaning that the event is twice as likely to happen as not. Note that the gambler who bets at \"odds on\" and wins will still be in profit, as his stake will be returned. For example, on a $2 bet, the gambler will be given $1 plus the returned stake of $2, yielding a $1 profit.\n\n\"Even odds\" occur when the probability of an event happening is exactly the same as it not happening. In common parlance, this is a \"50-50 chance\". Guessing heads or tails on a coin toss is the classic example of an event that has even odds. In gambling, it is commonly referred to as \"even money\" or simply \"evens\" (1 to 1, or 2 for 1). \"Evens\" implies that the payout will be one unit per unit wagered plus the original stake; that is, \"double your money\".\n\nThe meaning of the term \"better than evens\" (or \"worse than evens\") depends on context. From the perspective of a gambler rather than a statistician, \"better than evens\" means \"odds against\". If the odds are evens (1:1), betting 10 units would return 20 units for profit of 10 units. A successful gamble paying out at 4:1 would return 50 units for a profit of 40 units. So this wager is \"better than evens\" from the gambler's perspective because it pays out more than one for one. If an event is more likely to occur than an even chance, then the odds will be \"worse than evens\", and the bookmaker will pay out less than one for one.\n\nHowever, in popular parlance surrounding uncertain events, the expression \"better than evens\" usually implies a greater than 50-percent chance of an event occurring, which is exactly the opposite of the meaning of the expression when used in a gaming context.\n\nIn statistics, odds are an expression of relative probabilities, generally quoted as the odds \"in favor\". The odds (in favor) of an event or a proposition is the ratio of the probability that the event will happen to the probability that the event will not happen. Mathematically, this is a Bernoulli trial, as it has exactly two outcomes. In case of a finite sample space of equally likely outcomes, this is the ratio of the number of outcomes where the event occurs to the number of outcomes where the event does not occur; these can be represented as \"W\" and \"L\" (for Wins and Losses) or \"S\" and \"F\" (for Success and Failure). For example, the odds that a randomly chosen day of the week is a weekend are two to five (2:5), as days of the week form a sample space of seven outcomes, and the event occurs for two of the outcomes (Saturday and Sunday), and not for the other five. Conversely, given odds as a ratio of integers, this can be represented by a probability space of a finite number of equally likely outcomes. These definitions are equivalent, since dividing both terms in the ratio by the number of outcomes yields the probabilities: formula_8 Conversely, the odds against is the opposite ratio. For example, the odds against a random day of the week being a weekend are 5:2.\n\nOdds and probability can be expressed in prose via the prepositions \"to\" and \"in:\" \"odds of so many \"to\" so many on (or against) [some event]\" refers to \"odds\" – the ratio of numbers of (equally likely) outcomes in favor and against (or vice versa); \"chances of so many [outcomes], \"in\" so many [outcomes]\" refers to \"probability\" – the number of (equally like) outcomes in favour relative to the number for and against combined. For example, \"odds of a weekend are 2 \"to\" 5\", while \"chances of a weekend are 2 \"in\" 7\". In casual use, the words \"odds\" and \"chances\" (or \"chance\") are often used interchangeably to vaguely indicate some measure of odds or probability, though the intended meaning can be deduced by noting whether the preposition between the two numbers is \"to\" or \"in\".\n\nOdds can be expressed as a ratio of two numbers, in which case it is not unique – scaling both terms by the same factor does not change the proportions: 1:1 odds and 100:100 odds are the same (even odds). Odds can also be expressed as a number, by dividing the terms in the ratio – in this case it is unique (different fractions can represent the same rational number). Odds as a ratio, odds as a number, and probability (also a number) are related by simple formulas, and similarly odds in favor and odds against, and probability of success and probability of failure have simple relations. Odds range from 0 to infinity, while probabilities range from 0 to 1, and hence are often represented as a percentage between 0% and 100%: reversing the ratio switches odds for with odds against, and similarly probability of success with probability of failure.\n\nGiven odds (in favor) as the ratio W:L (Wins:Losses), the odds in favor (as a number) formula_9 and odds against (as a number) formula_10 can be computed by simply dividing, and are multiplicative inverses:\n\nAnalogously, given odds as a ratio, the probability of success or failure can be computed by dividing, and the probability of success and probability of failure sum to unity (one), as they are the only possible outcomes. In case of a finite number of equally likely outcomes, this can be interpreted as the number of outcomes where the event occurs divided by the total number of events:\n\nGiven a probability \"p,\" the odds as a ratio is formula_13 (probability of success to probability of failure), and the odds as numbers can be computed by dividing:\n\nConversely, given the odds as a number formula_15 this can be represented as the ratio formula_16 or conversely formula_17 from which the probability of success or failure can be computed:\nThus if expressed as a fraction with a numerator of 1, probability and odds differ by exactly 1 in the denominator: a probability of 1 \"in\" 100 (1/100 = 1%) is the same as odds of 1 \"to\" 99 (1/99 = 0.0101… = 0.), while odds of 1 \"to\" 100 (1/100 = 0.01) is the same as a probability of 1 \"in\" 101 (1/101 = 0.00990099… = 0.). This is a minor difference if the probability is small (close to zero, or \"long odds\"), but is a major difference if the probability is large (close to one).\n\nThese are worked out for some simple odds:\nThese transforms have certain special geometric properties: the conversions between odds for and odds against (resp. probability of success with probability of failure) and between odds and probability are all Möbius transformations (fractional linear transformations). They are thus specified by three points (sharply 3-transitive). Swapping odds for and odds against swaps 0 and infinity, fixing 1, while swapping probability of success with probability of failure swaps 0 and 1, fixing .5; these are both order 2, hence circular transforms. Converting odds to probability fixes 0, sends infinity to 1, and sends 1 to .5 (even odds are 50% likely), and conversely; this is a parabolic transform.\n\nIn probability theory and Bayesian statistics, odds may sometimes be more natural or more convenient than probabilities. This is often the case in problems of sequential decision making as for instance in problems of how to stop (online) on a last specific event which is solved by the odds algorithm. Similar ratios are used elsewhere in Bayesian statistics, such as the Bayes factor.\n\nThe odds are a ratio of probabilities; an odds ratio is a ratio of odds, that is, a ratio of ratios of probabilities. Odds-ratios are often used in analysis of clinical trials. While they have useful mathematical properties, they can produce counter-intuitive results: an event with an 80% probability of occurring is four times \"more likely\" to happen than an event with a 20% probability, but the \"odds\" are 16 times higher on the less likely event (4–1 \"against\", or 4) than on the more likely one (1–4, or 4–1 \"on\", or 0.25).\n\nIn some cases the log-odds are used, which is the logit of the probability. Most simply, odds are frequently multiplied or divided, and log converts multiplication to addition and division to subtractions.\n\n\nAnswer: The odds in favour of a blue marble are 2:13. One can equivalently say, that the odds are 13:2 \"against\". There are 2 out of 15 chances in favour of blue, 13 out of 15 against blue.\n\nIn probability theory and statistics, where the variable \"p\" is the probability in favor of a binary event, and the probability against the event is therefore 1-\"p\", \"the odds\" of the event are the quotient of the two, or formula_19. That value may be regarded as the relative probability the event will happen, expressed as a fraction (if it is less than 1), or a multiple (if it is equal to or greater than one) of the likelihood that the event will not happen.\n\nIn the very first example at top, saying the odds of a Sunday are \"one to six\" or, less commonly, \"one-sixth\" means the probability of picking a Sunday randomly is one-sixth the probability of not picking a Sunday. While the mathematical probability of an event has a value in the range from zero to one, \"the odds\" in favor of that same event lie between zero and infinity. The odds against the event with probability given as \"p\" are formula_20.\nThe odds against Sunday are 6:1 or  6/1 = 6. It is 6 times as likely that a random day is not a Sunday.\n\nThe use of odds in gambling facilitates betting on events where the relative probabilities of outcomes varied. For example, on a coin toss or a match race between two evenly matched horses, it is reasonable for two people to wager level stakes. However, in more variable situations, such as a multi-runner horse race or a football match between two unequally matched sides, betting \"at odds\" provides a perspective on the relative likelihoods of the possible outcomes.\n\nIn the modern era, most fixed odds betting takes place between a betting organisation, such as a bookmaker, and an individual, rather than between individuals. Different traditions have grown up in how to express odds to customers, older eras came with betting odds between people, today which is illegal in most countries, it was referred as \"odding\", an underground slang word with origins based in the Bronx.\n\nFavoured by bookmakers in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and also common in horse racing, fractional odds quote the net total that will be paid out to the bettor, should he or she win, relative to the stake. Odds of 4/1 would imply that the bettor stands to make a £400 profit on a £100 stake. If the odds are 1/4, the bettor will make £25 on a £100 stake. In either case, having won, the bettor always receives the original stake back; so if the odds are 4/1 the bettor receives a total of £500 (£400 plus the original £100). Odds of 1/1 are known as \"evens\" or \"even money\".\n\nThe numerator and denominator of fractional odds are always integers, thus if the bookmaker's payout was to be £1.25 for every £1 stake, this would be equivalent to £5 for every £4 staked, and the odds would therefore be expressed as 5/4. However, not all fractional odds are traditionally read using the lowest common denominator. For example, given that there is a pattern of odds of 5/4, 7/4, 9/4 and so on, odds which are mathematically 3/2 are more easily compared if expressed in the equivalent form 6/4.\n\nFractional odds are also known as \"British odds,\" \"UK odds,\" or, in that country, \"traditional odds\". They are typically represented with a \"/\" but can also be represented with a \"-\", e.g. 4/1 or 4-1. Odds with a denominator of 1 are often presented in listings as the numerator only.\n\nA variation of fractional odds is known as \"Hong Kong\" odds. Fractional and Hong Kong odds are actually exchangeable. The only difference is that the UK odds are presented as a fractional notation (e.g. 6/5) whilst the Hong Kong odds are decimal (e.g. 1.2). Both exhibit the net return.\n\nThe European odds also represent the potential winnings (net returns), but in addition they factor in the stake (e.g. 6/5 or 1.2 plus 1 = 2.2).\n\nFavoured in continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, decimal odds quote the ratio of the payout amount, \"including\" the original stake, to the stake itself. Therefore, the decimal odds of an outcome are equivalent to the decimal value of the fractional odds plus one. Thus even odds 1/1 are quoted in decimal odds as 2.00. The 4/1 fractional odds discussed above are quoted as 5.00, while the 1/4 odds are quoted as 1.25. This is considered to be ideal for parlay betting, because the odds to be paid out are simply the product of the odds for each outcome wagered on. Decimal odds are also favoured by betting exchanges because they are the easiest to work with for trading, as they reflect the inverse of the probability of an outcome. For example, a quoted odds of 5.00 equals to a probability of 1 / 5.00, that is 0.20 or 20%.\n\nDecimal odds are also known as \"European odds\", \"digital odds\" or \"continental odds.\"\n\nMoneyline odds are favoured by American bookmakers. The figure quoted is either positive or negative.\n\nMoneyline odds are often referred to as \"American odds\". A \"moneyline\" wager refers to odds on the straight-up outcome of a game with no consideration to a point spread. In most cases, the favorite will have negative moneyline odds (less payoff for a safer bet) and the underdog will have positive moneyline odds (more payoff for a risky bet). However, if the teams are evenly matched, \"both\" teams can have a negative line at the same time (e.g. -110 -110 or -105 -115), due to house take.\n\nWholesale odds are the \"real odds\" or 100% probability of an event occurring. This 100% book is displayed without any bookmaker's profit margin, often referred to as a bookmaker's \"overround\" built in. The book price is effectively a measure of the competitiveness of the odds prices on offer.\n\nA \"wholesale odds\" index is an index of all the prices in a probabilistic market operating at 100% competitiveness and displayed without any profit margin factored for market participants.\n\nIn gambling, the odds on display do not represent the true chances (as imagined by the bookmaker) that the event will or will not occur, but are the amount that the bookmaker will pay out on a winning bet, together with the required stake. In formulating the odds to display the bookmaker will have included a profit margin which effectively means that the payout to a successful bettor is less than that represented by the true chance of the event occurring. This profit is known as the 'over-round' on the 'book' (the 'book' refers to the old-fashioned ledger in which wagers were recorded, and is the derivation of the term 'bookmaker') and relates to the sum of the 'odds' in the following way:\n\nIn a 3-horse race, for example, the true probabilities of each of the horses winning based on their relative abilities may be 50%, 40% and 10%. The total of these three percentages is 100%, thus representing a fair 'book'. The true odds against winning for each of the three horses are 1-1, 3-2 and 9-1 respectively.\n\nIn order to generate a profit on the wagers accepted, the bookmaker may decide to increase the values to 60%, 50% and 20% for the three horses, respectively. This represents the odds against each, which are 4-6, 1-1 and 4-1, in order. These values now total 130%, meaning that the book has an overround of 30 (130−100). This value of 30 represents the amount of profit for the bookmaker if he gets bets in good proportions on each of the horses. For example, if he takes £60, £50, and £20 of stakes respectively for the three horses, he receives £130 in wagers but only pays £100 back (including stakes), whichever horse wins. And the expected value of his profit is positive even if everybody bets on the same horse. The art of bookmaking is in setting the odds low enough so as to have a positive expected value of profit while keeping the odds high enough to attract customers, and at the same time attracting enough bets for each outcome to reduce his risk exposure.\n\nA study on soccer betting found that the probability for the home team to win was generally about 3.4% less than the value calculated from the odds (for example, 46.6% for even odds). It was about 3.7% less for wins by the visitors, and 5.7% less for draws.\n\nMaking a profit in gambling involves predicting the relationship of the true probabilities to the payout odds. Sports information services are often used by professional and semi-professional sports bettors to help achieve this goal.\n\nThe odds or amounts the bookmaker will pay are determined by the total amount that has been bet on all of the possible events. They reflect the balance of wagers on either side of the event, and include the deduction of a bookmaker's brokerage fee (\"vig\" or vigorish).\n\nAlso, depending on how the betting is affected by jurisdiction, taxes may be involved for the bookmaker and/or the winning player. This may be taken into account when offering the odds and/or may reduce the amount won by a player.\n\n"}

Nick Cannon was the Dj for the event who is rumored to be in production filming a movie about Bishop Don Juan.\n\nThe 35th Anniversary of the Players Ball, was held on Saturday, December 5, 2009 at Chez Roues Banquet Hall in Chicago, IL. Ditch performed his first Players Ball show there.\n\nThe idea stemmed from a scene in the 1973 blaxploitation film, \"The Mack\", in which the lead character, a pimp named Goldie, attends The Players Ball in Oakland, California. Comedian Dan Aykroyd parodied this event in his film Doctor Detroit. Dave Chappelle satirized the event with \"The Playa Haters' Ball\" on an episode of The Chappelle Show. The party has been a November tradition since 1974, when pimps from across the country gathered to celebrate the birthday of Don Juan now known as Bishop Don \"Magic\" Juan. Every year, the award for \"Pimp of the Year\" is given out. Juan was the winner 13 years in a row.\n\nThe Player's Ball was shown in the HBO documentary \"Pimps Up, Ho's Down\" and the Hughes Brothers' documentary, \"American Pimp\".\n\nA DVD entitled Master Players Ball was also released in 2006. The DVD featured live scenes from a \"Players Ball.\"\n\nIn 2015, the Players Ball took place in Atlanta, GA. A former prostitute by the name of \"Tina F.\" reported that several pimps were arrested for having underage prostitutes, and claimed \"Two years ago in Atlanta, they stopped it and arrested 15 pimps and charged them. One pimp had a 10-year-old girl in his stable.\" \n\nIn 2005, a former prostitute identifying herself as \"Brenda Myers-Powell.\" protested the Players Ball event at Mariella's Banquet Hall on 5th Avenue in Maywood, IL. Brenda called the event a \"ball for child molesters\" because she began being trafficked by pimps at the age of 14 and says her experience is a common one.\n\nIn 2006, Matthew Thompkins, a former Postal Worker of Manhattanville, NY, was indicted. He was a former \"Pimp of the Year\" of the annual Players Ball. His aliases included; \"Knowledge\" and \"Daddy.\" While searching his property, Police located two \"Pimp of the Year\" awards.\n\nA well-known non-pimp Players Ball started in 1999 was thrown in Las Vegas and New Orleans as a private party for businesses attending adult oriented events. The event is organized by D-Money. The event was thrown twice a year and may coincide with other adult events such as AVN or Internext Expo.

{"id": "8494466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8494466", "title": "Priming (media)", "text": "Priming (media)\n\nThe priming theory states that media images stimulate related thoughts in the minds of audience members.\n\nGrounded in cognitive psychology, the theory of media priming is derived from the associative network model of human memory, in which an idea or concept is stored as a node in the network and is related to other ideas or concepts by semantic paths. Priming refers to the activation of a node in this network, which may serve as a filter, an interpretive frame, or a premise for further information processing or judgment formation.\n\nThe general aggression model (GAM) integrates the priming theory with the social learning theory to describe how previously learned violent behavior may be triggered by thoughts, emotions, or physiological states provoked by media exposure. However, the GAM has come under considerable criticism in recent years regarding underlying and unproven assumptions and poor data support for the theory.\n\nPolitical media priming is \"the process in which the media attend to some issues and not others and thereby alter the standards by which people evaluate election candidates\". A number of studies have demonstrated that there is a dimension of powerful media effects that goes beyond agenda setting. In 1982, Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder first identified this added dimension as the “priming effect.” The theory is founded on the assumption that people do not have elaborate knowledge about political matters and do not take into account all of what they do know when making political decisions — they must consider what more readily comes to mind. Through drawing attention to some aspects of politics at the expense of others, the media might help to set the terms by which political judgments are reached, including evaluations of political figures.\n\nIt should be noted that priming is often discussed in tandem with agenda-setting theory. The reason for this association is two-fold. The first, per Hastie & Park, is that both theories revolve around salient information recall, operating on the idea that people will use information that is most readily available when making decisions. The second, per Iyengar and Kinder, is that priming is latter part of a two-fold process with agenda-setting that takes place over time. Once agenda setting has made an issue salient, priming is the process by which \"mass media can... shape the considerations that people take into account when making judgements about political candidates or issues\". In short, both theories point to ease of accessibility of information in one's mind but priming is something that can occur over a period of time after exposure to a given media segment.\n\nPriming isn’t always unintentional, as Jacobs and Shapiro demonstrate in a quantitative and historical analysis of John F. Kennedy’s 1960 presidential campaign. Their research extends the application of priming theory from its original focus of how individuals form attitudes and make decisions to the study of candidate behavior. This new approach, they say, \"changes the analytic focus from unintentional priming to intentional priming, namely, the deliberate strategies that candidates pursue to influence voters\". Priming can be an effective campaign strategy for presidential candidates, the authors indicate, by a process of carefully calculated uses of public opinion on policy issues to influence voters’ standards for assessing the candidates’ attributes. In this study, the authors focus on the 1960 election because innovative public opinion surveys were incorporated into Kennedy’s campaign strategy that enabled him to use position taking to shape his image. Their research was based on primary evidence drawn from archival records and interviews, as well as a combination of interpretative and quantitative analysis. They found that a relationship exists between Kennedy’s positions on policy matters and results from his private public opinion surveys. His campaign combined image building with position taking on issues that responded to perceived public opinion. Though this study does neglect questions concerning how and why real politicians use polling results to prime voters, Jacobs and Shapiro effectively demonstrate that the priming process is powerful enough to be used intentionally by political candidates as a tool to influence public opinion during election campaigns.\n\nIn Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder's 1982 study of priming, they set out to determine what effect intentional priming might have on the public's evaluation of president Jimmy Carter. Their hypothesis stated that making certain political topics salient through primetime media, such as defense or spending, would cause viewers to evaluate president Carter based on said topics. The experiment's results demonstrated the phenomena of agenda-setting and priming. First, Iyengar et al. found evidence of agenda-setting in the positive correlation between exposure to a given political topic and its importance when evaluating the president. They then found that said standards affected the actual evaluation of the president's performance, demonstrating priming. This experiment points to the potential of news media to direct the public's attention and perception of political figures, though the researchers also indicate that subjects with higher self-reported levels of knowledge of politics showed decreased effects of priming. This lead Iyengar's team to the conclusion that priming has varied implications depending on an individual's given knowledge prior to political news media exposure.\n\n\n"}

A 2008 Cambodian Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation\nhas proven controversial, with international concerns regarding human rights abuses resulting from it, such as outlined in the 2010 Human Rights Watch report.\n\nThe comprehensive Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation was enacted in 2008. It punishes the trafficking of people, the managing of prostitutes and the maintaining of a brothel, as well as soliciting in public and distributing pornography. The mere act of exchanging sex for money is not outlawed.\n\nThe Women’s Network for Unity is a Cambodian sex worker organization which was established in 2000. It lobbies for legal and human rights and better working conditions for sex workers and aims to amend the 2008 law.\n\nIn 2016 UNAIDS estimated there to be 34,000 prostitutes in the country, many from Vietnam.\n\nSexual exchange has existed in Cambodia for centuries, but the events of the 20th century created a very unstable situation. During the Khmer Rouge years (1975–1979) prostitution was completely banned and punishable by death resulting in its virtual elimination in a highly authoritarian social system. Under the new State of Cambodia (1979–1993) commercial sex started to re-emerge. After the dismantlement of the State of Cambodia, about 20,000 male troops and civilian personnel of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) (1992–1993) arrived in Cambodia together with many NGOs and business interests from abroad, creating a new market for sexual services in a very poor country. UNTAC did little to stem the growth of prostitution in the country. Norodom Sihanouk had many reservations about the whole UNTAC operation, for the massive presence of UN foreign troops led in his eyes to the abuse and dishonor of Cambodian women.\n\nFollowing UNTAC withdrawal in August 1993, demand was reduced, and a drop in the number of commercial sex establishments and sex workers was apparent. By mid-1994 the numbers started to increase again in a period of political instability. By the mid-1990s police were harassing sex workers, but also owned many of the brothels, which were divided into Vietnamese or Khmer. Workers between 15 and 18 were not uncommon, but some establishments, such as those in Toul Kork and Svay Pak, specialised in providing younger workers. NGOs became alarmed by the growth of child prostitution along with number of women and children abducted sold for prostitution. By 1995 it appeared that women from some surrounding countries were entering Cambodia. International concern was raised and some raids were carried out including one by the International Justice Mission (2004). This had the effect of displacing the workers.\n\nThe number of prostitutes in Cambodia rose from about 6,000 at the time of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords, to over 20,000 after the arrival of UNTAC personnel in 1992, and declined to between 4,000–10,000 following their withdrawal.\n\nCambodia has a child sex tourism problem. Some children are sold by their own parents, others are lured by what they think are legitimate job offers like waitressing. Pimps are reported to imprison young children who are virgins, not putting them to work until they have been presented to a series of bidders such as high-ranking military officers, politicians, businessmen and foreign tourists. Young girls working in brothels are in effect sex slaves. They receive no money, only food, and there are armed guards to stop them from running away. Children are often held captive, beaten, and starved to force them into prostitution. The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency has extradited American sex tourists back home for prosecution. Vietnamese child prostitutes make up one third of child prostitutes in Cambodia, and Cambodian brothels employ girls and women from Vietnam.\n\nViolence against prostitutes, especially gang rape, called \"bauk\" in Cambodian, is common. Perpetrators include customers and police officers. According to some sources, such assaults are not condemned by society due to the stigmatization of prostitutes – a survey on opinions on \"bauk\" showed that only 13 percent of the males and 13 percent of the females interviewed considered that sex forced by a group of men on a prostitute was rape. The most common response – 33.4 percent of males and 40.7 percent of females – was that bauk was dangerous because of the potential transmission of sexually transmitted diseases; 12.5 percent of males and 8.1 percent of females said that gang rape against prostitutes didn't hurt anyone because the women were prostitutes and saw many men anyway; while 12.7 percent of males and 16.7 percent of females said it was better that this happened to prostitutes than to other women. Despite the social stigma cast on prostitutes, paying for sex is very common among men in Cambodia – while Khmer culture demands female virginity, it links masculinity to sexual activity, and as a result, prostitutes are the object of most young men's sexual encounters throughout their youth and early adulthood. Sexual violence against prostitutes was also described in a 2010 Amnesty International report, called \"Breaking the Silence – Sexual Violence in Cambodia\".\n\nCambodia has a high prevalence of HIV and AIDS, being one of the worst affected countries in Asia. By 1995 there were between 50,000 and 90,000 Cambodians affected by AIDS, according to a WHO estimate. Transmission is mainly through heterosexual contact. Factors contributing to this include poverty, the presence of other STIs which facilitate HIV transmission, and a highly mobile workforce. This pattern is also seen in the sex worker population. Improvement has been seen in the last decade with condom promotion. Since 2001, there has been a \"100% condom program\" in place, which promoted safe sex.\n\nThe U.S. State Department frequently condemns Cambodia for its sex trade, and downgraded their categorisation of the country in 2004.\n\nSomaly Mam has fabricated a number of anti-trafficking stories to attract foreign aid donations. Mam ran the foundation AFESIP, which has been influential in helping the police raid hotels and kidnap their employees.\n\nSome international commentators have noted that the garment industry in Cambodia is abusive, and efforts to remove sex workers from brothels and give them jobs making clothes can backfire if some return to the brothels.\n\nCambodia is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Cambodian adults and children migrate to other countries within the region and increasingly to the Middle East for work; many are subjected sex trafficking. Migrants using irregular migration channels, predominantly with the assistance of unlicensed brokers, are at an increased risk of trafficking, but those using licensed recruiting agents also become victims of sex trafficking. A significant number of women from rural areas are recruited under false pretences to travel to China to enter into marriages with Chinese men, who often incur as much as $20,000 in debt to brokers facilitating the transaction; some of these women are then subjected to forced prostitution as a result of this debt.\n\nAll of Cambodia’s 25 provinces are sources for human trafficking. Sex trafficking is largely clandestine; Cambodian and ethnic Vietnamese women and girls move from rural areas to cities and tourist destinations, where they are subjected to sex trafficking in brothels and, more frequently, such “indirect” sex establishments as beer gardens, massage parlors, salons, karaoke bars, retail spaces, and non-commercial sites. Cambodian men form the largest source of demand for children exploited in prostitution; however, men from elsewhere in Asia and Europe, the United States, Australia, and South Africa travel to Cambodia to engage in child sex tourism.\n\nVietnamese women and children, many of whom are victims of debt bondage, travel to Cambodia and are subjected to sex trafficking. NGOs report criminal gangs transport some Vietnamese victims through Cambodia before they are exploited in Thailand and Malaysia. Traffickers in Cambodia are most commonly family or community members or small networks of independent brokers. Endemic corruption aids and abets trafficking crimes. Some police reportedly solicit commercial sex with children. Corrupt officials facilitate cross-border trafficking, thwart progress on investigations and prosecutions, and in some cases profit directly from establishments suspected of trafficking.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Cambodia as a 'Tier 2' country.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "790288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=790288", "title": "Street Fighter Alpha 2", "text": "Street Fighter Alpha 2\n\nStreet Fighter Alpha 2, known as in Japan/Asia and South America, is a fighting game originally released for the CPS II arcade hardware by Capcom. The game is both a sequel and a remake to the previous year's \"Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams\", which is itself a prequel to the \"Street Fighter II\" series in terms of plot and setting. The game features a number of improvements over the original, such as new attacks, stages, endings, and gameplay features. It was followed by \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\".\n\n\"Street Fighter Alpha 2\" retains most of the new features introduced in the original \"Street Fighter Alpha\", such as the three-level Super Combo gauge, Alpha Counters, Air-Blocking, and Fall Breaking. The main new feature in the game is the inclusion of the Custom Combo system (Original Combo in Japan), which replaces the Chain Combos from the first \"Alpha\". If the Super Combo gauge is on Lv. 1 or above, the player can initiate a Custom Combo pressing two punch buttons and a kick or one punch button and two kicks. The player can then perform any series of basic and special moves to create a Custom Combo until the Timer Gauge at the bottom of the screen runs out. The characters Guy and Gen can still perform Chain Combos, but only to a limited extent. Additionally, each character now has two Alpha Counters instead of just one: one that can be performed with a kick button and another with a punch button.\n\nThe single-player mode, much like the original \"Street Fighter Alpha\", consists of eight matches against computer-controlled opponents, including a fixed final opponent whose identity depends on the player's selected character. Each character also has a secret \"rival\" whom they can face during the course of the single-player mode. After meeting certain requirements, the rival will interrupt one of the player's matches and exchange dialogue with the player's character, and the player character will then fight the rival instead. With Akuma now a regular character, a more powerful version of the character dubbed \"Shin Akuma\" replaces him as a secret opponent. Unlike \"Super Turbo\" and the original \"Alpha\", Shin Akuma challenges the player before the player's final opponent, rather than as an alternate final boss.\n\nThe game brings back all thirteen characters from \"Street Fighter Alpha\", with M. Bison, Akuma, and Dan now being immediately selectable as playable characters. In addition to the \"Alpha\" roster, \"Alpha 2\" includes Dhalsim and Zangief, both from \"Street Fighter II\", Gen, an assassin from the original \"Street Fighter\", Rolento, a member of the Mad Gear gang who originally appeared in \"Final Fight\", and newcomer Sakura, a Japanese schoolgirl who takes up street fighting after witnessing one of Ryu's battles.\n\nAccording to Capcom senior planner Shinji Mikami, \"When we were trying to get the balance of Alpha 2 right we only concentrated on Alpha 2. That's the one that's important. We don't really have to get the actual same damage as Alpha. In Alpha 2 some new characters were introduced, so in order to maintain the game balance we had to increase the damage for the normal hits. In addition, this time for Alpha 2 we wanted to focus on the importance of the normal hits and not just the specials.\"\n\n\"Street Fighter Alpha 2\" was first unveiled at the February 1996 AOU show in Tokyo.\n\n\"Street Fighter Alpha 2\" was released under the title of \"Street Fighter Zero 2\" in Japan, Asia, and South America. The American and European versions of \"Alpha 2\" feature three additional characters who were not in the \"Zero 2\" version: Evil Ryu and the EX versions of Dhalsim and Zangief. These three characters were selected by Capcom USA.\n\nCapcom released an updated version of \"Zero 2\" titled Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha, which features all the additional characters from \"Alpha 2\", as well as other changes to the game. In addition to Zangief and Dhalsim, \"Zero 2 Alpha\" also features EX versions of Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Sagat, and M. Bison, all of whom were characters from \"\". Custom Combos are now executed by pressing a punch and kick button of the same strength simultaneously and now require half (1½ level) of the Super Combo gauge filled to perform them. Some of the characters have gained new moves such as Ryu's \"Shakunetsu Hadouken\" and Dhalsim's Yoga Tempest. \"Zero 2 Alpha\" also features a survival mode, as well as a 2-on-1 Dramatic Battle mode similar to the hidden \"Ryu and Ken vs. Bison mode\" in the original \"Alpha\". In the Japanese version of \"Zero 2 Alpha\", Evil Ryu has different dialogue exchanges and a different ending from his regular counterpart.\n\n\nA reviewer for \"Next Generation\" gave the arcade version 3 out of 5 stars, praising the large number of characters, smooth animation, innovative backgrounds, and \"wonderful\" character design. He deemed the custom combos \"an unprecedented, new, and complex innovation in \"Street Fighter\" gameplay\", though he found some points of their implementation to be odd. He concluded, \"Although it's just another 2D fighter for those who aren't paying attention, this is a fine new addition for true hard-core gameplayers.\"\n\nIn the Japanese arcade magazine \"\", \"Street Fighter Zero 2\" was voted Best Game of 1996 in the . \"Zero 2\" was also No. 1 in the category of \"Best Fighting Game\", No. 9 in \"Best Graphics\", No. 6 in \"Best Direction\", and No. 4 in \"Best VGM (Video Game Music)\". Dan Hibiki and Sakura Kasugano were depicted on the cover of this issue, who were placed No. 1 and No. 3 respectively on the Top 50 Characters of 1996, with Ryu at No. 13, Zangief at No. 18 (sharing the spot with Mature from \"The King of Fighters '96\"), Guy at No. 26, Chun-Li at No. 32, Akuma at No. 37 (sharing the spot with two other characters), Rolento at No. 45 (sharing the spot with the Elf from \"\") and Ken at No. 49 (sharing the spot with two other characters).\n\nThe Saturn and PlayStation ports both received praise for their faithfulness to their arcade counterpart, large selection of characters, and replacement of the easily exploited chain combo system from the original \"Street Fighter Alpha\". Some critics, while acknowledging that the 2D fighting game genre was outdated, held \"Street Fighter Alpha 2\" to be equal or even superior to any of the 3D fighting games then on the market. The Saturn version tied with the PlayStation version of \"Tomb Raider\" for \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s \"Game of the Month\". Though \"EGM\" never reviewed the PlayStation version of \"Alpha 2\", in an overview of fighting games released in 1996 Sushi-X commented, \"Both the Saturn and PlayStation versions are great, but the Saturn version has a few advantages\", citing frames of animation that were missing from the PlayStation version and the Saturn-exclusive illustrations mode. The Saturn port was also a commercial success, selling over 400,000 units in Japan.\n\nThe Super NES version was much less well-received, with reviews commenting that the sound quality is exceptionally poor and that the overambitious graphics cause the game to play at an agonizingly slow speed compounded by bouts of slowdown when performing special moves. Shawn Smith and Dan Hsu of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" deemed it the worst \"Street Fighter\" game for the Super NES. Co-reviewers Crispin Boyer and Sushi-X and \"GamePro\"s The Gun Nut were more forgiving, concluding that despite the port's flaws it was a decent buy for gamers who did not own a Saturn or PlayStation.\n"}

Over 1.5 million units were sold worldwide, allowing \"Supreme Snowboarding\" to become the first hit title in Finnish game development. The game received positive critical reception, as well as acclaim for having one of the best visuals of its time, though its lack of content and replay value was sometimes criticized.\n\nHousemarque's \"Supreme Snowboarding\" was the first Finnish game to be truly successful, and the first to sell over one million units. The game's core is built around three major game modes:\nThe controls of the game received praise, with players only using three other keys for jumps, tricks and carving snow, along with the directional keys. Players hit the jump key to initiate a trick, the trick key is used to perform such tricks, and the third button allows characters to turn faster by carving into the snow.\n\nThere are nine slalom and six trick courses, as well as six characters, each with their unique pros and cons. Each course features four types of weather and is divided into three types: Alpine, Village or Forest. There are also four snowboards, each designed to accommodate a different type of snowboarding. No internet multiplayer is offered though players can play with up to eight people over a LAN.\n\n\"Supreme Snowboarding\" was often bundled with other products; for example, players obtained a copy of the game with their Kellogg's cereal. A cut version of the game, titled \"Flo-Boarding\", was packaged into every N-Gage device in 2003, becoming the first game to be bundled together with the phone.\n\nThere were initial efforts by Sega of America to port \"high-profile titles\" including \"Supreme Snowboarding\" to the Dreamcast console, though, like many others, such efforts eventually failed due to the platform's uncertain profile with the impending arrival of the PlayStation 2.\n\nThe game initially received critical acclaim upon release in Finland, with its graphics, speed and responsive controls being lauded. Reviewers praised the game for its realistic snowy environments and special effects, such as shadowing and weather. It was also commended as being easy to control and enjoyable to play, though criticism was leveled at the limited number of tracks and lack of content.\n\nJuho Kuorikoski, in his book \"Finnish Video Games: A History and Catalog\", noted in a more contemporary review how despite \"\"Supreme Snowboarding\" [not being] the young buck it used to be, it still has that addictive element to it. While less impressive on the outside, its inner beauty has remained intact.\"\n\nIn the United States, going on sale under the title \"Boarder Zone\", IGN rated the game a 8/10, praising the graphics, value for money and \"simple fun\" of the game, but fault was found with the game's relative lack of content. This sentiment was echoed by GameSpot, who praised the graphics and gameplay of \"Boarder Zone\", but also complained about the lack of content and replay value. \"PC Magazine\" agreed on all points, noting the \"smooth\" 3-D engine and realism while criticizing \"Boarder Zone\"s poor long-term appeal.\n\nAs a technologically advanced game, \"Supreme Snowboarding\" was adopted by hardware manufacturers to showcase the potential of PC processors and graphics cards in 1998 and 1999 at industry events.\n\nA sequel titled \"Transworld Snowboarding\" was released for the Xbox console in 2002, noted for being the first ever Finnish-developed console game. It was renamed from \"Supreme Snowboarding 2\" following a licensing shift as the publisher was moved from France to the United States and eventually became a moderate hit.\n"}

The film stars Omid Djalili, Richard Schiff, Yigal Naor and Matt Lucas. It revolves around a British Muslim who goes through an identity crisis when he discovers he was adopted as a child, having been born to a Jewish family.\n\nMahmud Nasir is a husband, father and a British Muslim who listens to rock music, particularly the long deceased pop star Gary Page, and occasionally drinks alcohol. His son, Rashid, wishes to marry Uzma, but they need the blessing of her devout Muslim cleric stepfather, Arshad Al-Masri. Mahmud agrees to put on the act of devout Muslim for the occasion. \n\nMahmud, while clearing out his recently deceased mother's house, stumbles across an adoption certificate. Mahmud learns he was actually adopted by his Muslim parents when he was two weeks old; his birth parents were Jewish, and his real name is Solomon \"Solly\" Shimshillewitz. This comes as a shock to Mahmud, who is somewhat anti-Semitic, exemplified by his relationship with his American Jewish neighbour, Leonard \"Lenny\" Goldberg.\n\nDuring an argument with Lenny, Mahmud lets slip his ethnicity and his real name, and Lenny mentions a similarity to the name, Isaac \"Izzy\" Shimshillewitz, a local man, who may be Mahmud's biological father. Mahmud tracks his father to a Jewish old age home. He tries to visit, but a rabbi refuses him entry, saying it would be a shock for Izzy, a Jewish man, to see his son, a Muslim, and advises him to learn to act more like a Jew if he desires to see his father before he dies. \n\nLenny agrees to teach Mahmud what he knows about being a Jew, such as dancing like Topol and learning basic Yiddish, but the frequent trips to Lenny's house arouse Mahmud's family's suspicions, especially when Mahmud's kippah is spotted during a Muslim rally. Mahmud publicly burns the kippah in desperation as a symbol of his supposed hatred of Jews. Mahmud later attends a Bar Mitzvah with Lenny and unintentionally tells a very crude joke to the audience in broken Yiddish, only to be greeted with laughter from the attendees. Mahmud and Lenny attempt to see Izzy, but the rabbi still refuses to let Mahmud inside when he cannot say his Jewish Sh'ma or name the Five Books of Moses in Hebrew.\n\nMahmud and Lenny have a bitter argument and Mahmud storms off, vowing to tell his family the truth immediately, but when he gets home, he sees that Arshad, Uzma and their friends are already there. Arshad, impressed with Mahmud's supposed devotion to Islam after having seen him burn the kippah on TV, gives his blessing to Rashid and Uzma's union, but the police arrive, along with the media and a crowd of angry Jews and supportive Muslims, to arrest Mahmud for burning the kippah. In desperation, he yells out in front of everyone that he is Jewish, exonerating him of the crime. A disgusted Arshad leaves with Uzma and his friends.\n\nMahmud's family leaves him for his dishonesty, one of his colleagues at work resigns, and he starts drinking. He becomes suicidal, but is rescued by Lenny, who saw his announcement on the news. Mahmud goes to the old age home and demands to see his father, but learns that his father has already died. Mahmud is allowed inside Izzy's room where he finds a video of his announcement in Izzy's video machine, which Lenny had sent Izzy. Mahmud's only solace is a sticker on the video with the name \"Solly\" on it, indicating that even after all these years, Izzy still remembered his long-lost son.\n\nMahmud appears at Arshad's next rally and delivers a speech on behalf of himself, Jewish citizens and Muslims. Mahmud also tells the crowd of another discovery which he's made: Arshad is actually Gary Page, who staged his own death following his fall from fame after a racist remark, resurfacing much later with a whole new identity as a devout Muslim cleric. Arshad escapes from the rally, comically dressed in his old Gary Page clothes. Rashid and Uzma, dressed in Indian clothing, are married in a Bollywood style wedding, attended by both Muslims and Jews. Lenny has taken a job with the mostly-Muslim taxi firm at which Mahmud works.\n\n\nDavid Baddiel wrote \"The Infidel\" because he has \"always been a fan of life-swap comedy (Big, Trading Places, etc)\";\nhe \"think[s] that people are terrified about race and religion, especially issues surrounding Muslims and Jews, and when people are terrified, what they really should do is laugh\"; and he \"love[s] Omid Djalili and his big funny face. [He's] hoping that people recognise that underneath the comedy, the message of the film is one of mutual tolerance: if not, [He's] hoping to find a new identity.\"\n\nBBC Films helped develop the film's script. They withdrew shortly after the \"Sachsgate\" scandal, in which the BBC were criticised for offensive content.\n\nThe film was released 9 April 2010 in the United Kingdom. Distribution rights to the film were sold to 62 different countries, including many Arab and Muslim countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Lebanon, Oman, Iran and Saudi Arabia. The film has been shown in Iran but was not picked up by Israeli distributors.\n\n65% of the 23 approved Rotten Tomatoes critics gave the film a positive review.\n\nThe film was remade in India with the title of \"Dharam Sankat Mein\" (Crisis of Faith) where the basic premise remains same with a man raised by a Hindu family finding out he was born into a Muslim family.\n\n"}

{"id": "36605363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36605363", "title": "The Virtuous Burglar", "text": "The Virtuous Burglar\n\nThe Virtuous Burglar (Italian title: \"Non tutti i ladri vengono per nuocere\") is a one-act play by Dario Fo.\n\nA Feydeau-style farce in which a burglar who is in the act of burgling the house is interrupted by the arrival of a couple - who are in fact having an affair. The farcical complications that ensue also involve the arrival of the burglar's wife. In the end, as they are all arguing among themselves, yet another burglar arrives to burgle the flat.\n\nThe play begins with a burglar breaking into a luxury flat. His wife phones him and he is annoyed. As he hangs up, the owner of the house and a woman turn up. The burglar hides inside a grandfather clock but knocks the pendulum, leading the owner and the woman to think that the clock has struck 1:00am. The owner and the woman are having an affair. The owner complains that his wife is so old fashioned and the woman complains that her husband is easily persuaded.\n\nThe burglar's wife phones and the owner answers. The burglar's wife thinks she is talking to her husband and that he is having an affair. The owner explains that he isn't her husband and believes that because the husband was watching them, he is a private detective, hired by his wife to see if he was having an affair. This leads the burglar's wife to think that the owner of the house's wife and her husband are having an affair. The owner tells her to phone the house where he thinks his wife is. The woman believes that the 'detective' has phoned the police already and tells the owner to shoot himself. As he is about to pull the trigger, the clock strikes 12:30. This confuses the owner and the woman as they believe the clock is going backwards. The burglar emerges from the clock, having been hit repeatedly by the pendulum. The owner and the woman think they have found the 'detective' and plan to shoot him.\n\nThe burglar convinces them not to, but instead, get him drunk. Suddenly, the burglar steals the gun from the owner and threatens him. He reveals he is a burglar. This interests the woman as she has an obsession with \"Celebrated Crimes and Thefts.\" The burglar proves he is a leading member of a notorious gang.\n\nSuddenly, the owner's wife, Anna, turns up. The owner takes the gun and forces the burglar to pretend to be the woman's husband. Anna comes in and tells them she had a telephone call from a woman (the burglar's wife) who said she was having an affair with her husband. The owner introduces the burglar and his \"wife\" and Anna invites them to stay the night. The spiteful burglar agrees, much to the disdain of the owner and the woman.\n\nThe woman and Anna go to sort out a room. The owner forces the burglar at gunpoint to steal, because the burglar said that they exploited burglars. The burglar's real wife turns up and, after a brief conversation, believes that her husband has two wives. Anna appears and the owner poorly explains why the burglar has two wives. The owner spitefully tells the real wife to come and meet the other \"wife\".\n\nAfter they have left, a man, Antonio, appears, asking Anna if she is alone. They are having an affair too. Antonio believes Anna set everything up so that she could cancel their date to have an affair with someone else. At this point, the burglar returns to collect his bag. Antonio thinks the burglar and Anna are having an affair and locks them in. Anna explains but Antonio loses the key. Suddenly, the \"wives\" and owner return. The burglar helps Antonio hide in the clock. The burglar's real wife wants to leave, but there is no key. The burglar picks the lock. As he does so, the clock strikes 1:00am. Antonio emerges, having also been hit by the pendulum. The woman and Antonio are surprised to see each other as they are married.\n\nThe burglar attempts to explain things, but the others shut him up so he doesn't reveal the affairs, saying it's all one big misunderstanding. The burglar and his wife escape. The others try and catch them. As they do, another burglar arrives. The others, thinking the first burglar has returned to collect his loot, grab the second burglar. They tell him it's all one big misunderstanding and say they will explain. As they all ramble on with their lies, the second burglar escapes.\n\nEd Emery has carried out an English translation (\"The Good that a Burglar Can Bring\").\n\nJoe Farrell has carried out an English adaptation (\"The Virtuous Burglar\").\n"}
{"id": "21564668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21564668", "title": "UAV Outback Challenge", "text": "UAV Outback Challenge\n\nThe UAV Challenge - Outback Rescue, also known as the UAV Outback Challenge or UAV Challenge, is an annual competition for the development of unmanned aerial vehicles. The competition was first held in 2007 and features an open challenge for adults, and a high-school challenge. The event is aimed at promoting the civilian use of unmanned aerial vehicles and the development of low-cost systems that could be used for search and rescue missions. The event is one of the largest robotics challenges in the world and one of the highest stakes UAV challenges, with the current Medical Express version of the event offering $75,000 to the winner.\n\nThe events involve a thorough scoring system with an emphasis on safety, capability and technical excellence. In particular there is a strong tendency towards autonomous flight. Notably, teams share technical details of their entries, allowing successful innovations to proliferate and increasing the speed of technological development.\n\nThe format of the Challenge changes as technological improvements make the tasks more achievable. In 2011 it changed to a search and rescue challenge. No teams successfully completed the challenge until 2014 when several teams were successful. In 2016 the open challenge changed to an automated medical retrieval task known as Medical Express.\n\nThe Medical Express Challenge is the current event that is open to all. It was first held between 2015 and 2016 with the first event held in Dalby, Queensland, Australia in September 2016. The current Medical Express runs from 2017 to 2018 with the event again being held in Dalby. The challenge itself is for teams to develop a solution to the problem of remote medical retrieval. Teams have to fly their aircraft at least 20km to a remote farm, detect the farmer \"Outback Joe\" and autonomously land close by. The farmer places a medical sample into the aircraft and it must then return to the original launch point which is at least 20km away. The challenge was very nearly completed at the first attempt by a team from Canberra, Australia called Canberra UAV. Their communications relay aircraft crashed at the remote farm site due to an engine failure and the challenge was hence not completed. But their main aircraft did successfully return the medical sample from the farm.\n\nThe Search and Rescue Challenge was held from 2011 to 2014. It was open to worldwide participation, including by universities and hobbyists. In the challenge, teams must find a target dummy, called \"Outback Joe\" and accurately deliver an emergency package to him. The backstory of Joe is that he is a bushwalker that has gotten lost, or a worker who's ute has broken down. He is represented by a 50 kg mannequin dressed in jeans, a work shirt, work boots and an Akubra. The mission area is nearly from the airport and is approximately x . Teams must not fly greater than 1500 ft above ground level (AGL). Under the rules, teams were required to firstly identify the latitude and longitude of the target to within 100 meters. Teams that succeeded in this task were permitted to attempt to drop the package and complete the challenge.\n\nOutback Joe was first spotted in 2010 by the University of North Dakota team. In 2012, the Canberra UAV team's aircraft automatically located the target the first fully automatic detection during all events. In 2014, 5 teams correctly identified the target location allowing them to drop a package to him. The winner of the challenge was CanberraUAV, who dropped a water bottle to within 2.6 metres of the target.\n\nThe Airborne delivery challenge is open to Australian high school students. The objective is to create a future generation of aerospace professionals with a focus on UAVs.\n\nAn airframe has to be built and the mission is executed by two persons who will not communicate during the mission and will have technological targeting solutions in place: \nOther team members are permitted and many teams have roles for a team manager, media manager and safety manager.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010 a Robot Airborne Delivery Challenge was also held in parallel to the main Airborne Delivery Challenge. The Robot competition was dropped in 2011 in favor of bonus points for autonomous payload dropping in the Airborne Delivery Challenge.\n\nThe first place team in the open competition receives the Rod Walker Trophy. The trophy is named in honour of Rodney Walker (QUT), who conceived of the idea of the UAV Outback Challenge in 2005 along with Jonathan Roberts and George Curran of CSIRO.\nRod Walker, a Professor at Queensland University of Technology, died in October 2011, aged 42. A memorial fund was set up to support individuals and organisations that try to enhance the use of UAVs for civilian purposes.\n\nPast winners of the Rod Walker Trophy\n\nThe term The Kingaroy Triangle was coined during the second UAV Challenge event in 2008 when it was noticed that aircraft and systems that had worked perfectly well before the UAV Challenge suddenly appeared to have problems at Kingaroy. The term is a reference to the more famous Bermuda Triangle and also a reference to the general shape of the competition boundary area, which is roughly triangular in nature.\n\n2018 marks the return of the Medical Express Challenge for the open teams and the introduction of voluntary dynamic no-fly zones (DNFZ) to the competition. Dynamic no-fly zones represent obstacles that an UAV must avoid during its transit to the search area, which can be birds, bad weather and other aircraft. These obstacles are generated by a computer and passed onto the teams. Due to the complexity of this requirement,only a few teams attempted this aspect of the challenge, with the stand out being Canberra UAV whose avoidance performance impressed the judges. \n\nThe main goal of the competition was to fly to a designated search area and search for a target, onto which the aircraft must land vertically within 10m and retrieve a blood sample from Outback Joe, and return to the base with the sample. The competition was exceptionally close this year, with the top two teams scoring within 1% of one another. The team that has come out on top was Monash UAS, an undergraduate university team from Melbourne, Australia. Although no teams technically completed the challenge due to a variety of reasons, the top three teams were able to return the sample to the base intact. \n\n2015 was a high school-only event with the international Medical Express Challenge starting that year but running for two years (with its own event in Queensland, Australia planned for September 2016). The high-school event was held for the third time at Calvert Radio Aero Modellers Society flying field (approximately west of Ipswich, Queensland). The event was significant in that major changes to the rules of the Airborne Delivery Challenge meant that the mission task was far more difficult for teams that it had been in previous years. For this competition, teams had to drop a medical payload without breaking it. 2015 also saw the re-introduction of a fully autonomous competition for high-school students, the Robotic Delivery Challenge. Three teams qualified, but none managed to complete the mission.\n\nIn 2015 the UAV Challenge was organised by ARCAA (a QUT research centre) and Data61 (a unit of CSIRO). It was sponsored by Insitu Pacific, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, DSTO, and LightWare. The Challenge was also supported by the Queensland Government.\n\nThe 2014 event was held at Kingaroy September 22–26 and followed the same format to the 2012 competition with both a Search and Rescue and Airborne Delivery Challenge. For the first time ever, the Search and Rescue mission task was completed and the UAV Challenge Outback Rescue was won. Four teams completed the mission task with CanberraUAV winning the $50,000 prize on points. They were also awarded the Rod Walker Trophy for their win. They completed the mission with an autonomous takeoff, a bottle drop accuracy of 2.6m and a fully autonomous landing. One hundred and sixteen Search and Rescue teams registered for the event, with the field of teams being reduced to 20 after the Deliverable 3 qualifying round. Fourteen teams flew at the event and left the airport, beating the previous record of four teams. Four teams successfully completed the task of finding Outback Joe and delivering him at least 500ml of water to within 100m of his location. Team SFWA from Melbourne, Australia, were the first team in the history of the event to complete the mission. A fifth team, VAMUdeS from Canada came close to completing the mission with a drop of 116m. The Search and Rescue competition Airmanship Award was sponsored by Insitu Pacific and was awarded to Pawel Wozniak for his outstanding team leadership and decision making.\n\nThe high-school Airborne Delivery Challenge in 2014 was, for the first time, open to high-school teams from outside Australia. Fifteen teams entered and qualified to attend the event in Kingaroy. The winner of the Airborne Delivery main competition was the all-girls team the DareDivas from Mueller College, Australia. Another all-girls team, from Knight High School in California, came third. The Airborne Delivery competition Airmanship Award was sponsored by Insitu Pacific and was awarded to Russell Porter from Indooroopilly State High School.\n\nIn 2014 the UAV Challenge was organised by ARCAA (a QUT research centre) and CSIRO. It was sponsored by Insitu Pacific, Northrop Grumman, Mathworks, Boeing, CASA, Stanwell Corporation Limited and DSTO. The Challenge was also supported by the Queensland Government, South Burnett Regional Council, UAS-Pacific, and Australian Defence Magazine. The event also had the assistance of personnel from Raytheon Australia, Aviation Australia, V-TOL Aerospace and the Victoria Police Air Wing.\n\n2013 was a high-school only event with the international Search and Rescue Challenge starting that year but running for two years (with its own event at Kingaroy, Queensland, Australia planned for September 2014).\nFor the second time, the Airborne Delivery Challenge (High-School teams) championship was held at Calvert Radio Aero Modellers Society flying field. The Challenge took place between September 24 and 25. The competition was very close and was notable because for the first time a high-school team (The Hexfactor for Mueller College) managed to achieve a successful autonomous drop of a chocolate bar to Outback Joe, landing within the required 10m distance to be award bonus points. Although the Hexfactor did not win the event, the fact that they succeeded with some autonomy was a milestone for the UAV Challenge.\n\nIn 2013 the UAV Challenge was organised by ARCAA (a QUT research centre) and CSIRO. It was sponsored by Insitu Pacific, Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Mathworks. The Challenge was also supported by the Queensland Government, the Australian Association for Unmanned Systems, and UAS-Pacific. The event also had the assistance of personnel from VTOL-Aerospace and Aviation Australia.\n\nThe 2012 event was held at Kingaroy October 1–3 and followed a similar format to the 2010 competition with both a Search and Rescue and Airborne Delivery Challenge. The 2012 Search and Rescue competition actually began in 2011 when the competition was lengthened to 18 months in duration. 2012 saw the introduction of the Search Phase as part of the Airborne Delivery Challenge competitions.\n\nSixty-eight teams registered for the Search and Rescue Challenge, with 53 passing the first checkpoint. Over the subsequent 18 months the field was reduced to just five, the rest having either failed to pass certain milestones or withdrawing due to technical difficulties such as crashes. At the event in Kingaroy, four teams launched their aircraft into the range. The main task was not completed by any of the teams. However, two teams did manage to complete a significant portion of their search phase and successfully returned their aircraft to the airport. Team Canberra UAV achieved automatic detection of Outback Joe - the first team to do so in the history of the event. They did not manage to drop the bottle of water due to an in-flight incident prior to the Outback Joe detection when it appeared that the water bottle became loose from the aircraft and fell off.\n\nThirteen teams competed in the Airborne Delivery Challenge with a winner declared for its Search Phase. The Airmanship Award was sponsored by Insitu Pacific and was awarded to Nina Clark for her outstanding team leadership.\n\nIn 2012 the UAV Challenge was organised by ARCAA (QUT and CSIRO), AUVS-Australia and Aviation Development Australia Limited. It was sponsored by Insitu Pacific, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, CASA, Mathworks, Aviation Australia, Stanwell Corporation Limited and DSTO. The Challenge was also supported by the Queensland Government, South Burnett Regional Council, UAS-Pacific, the U.S. Office of Naval Research Global, the Asian Office of Aerospace Research and Development, and Australian Defence Magazine. The event also had the assistance of personnel from Raytheon, the Royal Australian Navy and the Victoria Police Air Wing.\n\nOn 16 March 2011, the UAV Challenge organizers announced major changes to the format of the Challenges. Stated changes included a new longer format Search and Rescue Challenge that results in an event at Kingaroy being held every two years instead of every year (as was done from 2007 to 2010) and the development of Australian State Championships for the Airborne Delivery Challenge. The organizers were quoted as saying that they believe this will lead to \"more participants competing with a very high standard of UAV capability\".\n\nFor the first time, the event was not held at Kingaroy. Instead an Airborne Delivery Challenge (High-School teams) championship was held at Calvert Radio Aero Modellers Society flying field (approximately west of Ipswich, Queensland) between September 27 and 28.\n\nIn 2011 the UAV Challenge was organised by ARCAA (QUT and CSIRO) and AUVS-Australia. It was sponsored by Queensland Government, had the assistance of Ipswich City Council, and technical staff from Boeing, UAS Pacific and Skills Queensland.\n\nThe 2010 UAV Challenge took place between September 27 and 29. In the Search and Rescue competition a team from the University of North Dakota became the first in UAV Challenge history to successfully locate Outback Joe, managing to pinpoint his location to within 15 m (from 800 ft AGL). However, they failed to drop a water bottle within 100 m (as required by the rules) and hence did not win the A$50,000 prize. Team Robota, from Texas, was awarded second place after their aircraft successfully entered the search area but had to abort the mission due to a technical issue. A total of 43 teams entered the Search and Rescue competition with 12 qualifying to fly but only six flying at the event.\n\nIn 2010 the UAV Challenge was organised by ARCAA (QUT and CSIRO), Queensland Government and Aviation Development Australia Limited. It was sponsored by Insitu, CASA, Australian Defence Magazine, AUVS-Australia, Boeing, CAE Inc. and South Burnett Regional Council.\n\nThe 2009 UAV Challenge was announced in the December/January 2008 issue of Aviation Business Asia Pacific magazine. The 2009 event took place between September 28 and October 1. The combined challenge award funds were A$70,000.00. 34 Search and Rescue teams from 5 countries expressed an interest in entering with 12 finally qualifying for the event. In addition to the traditional Search and Rescue Challenge and Airborne Delivery Challenge, there was a new Robot Airborne Delivery Challenge open to high-school students. The two separate documentary challenges of the previous years were combined into a single Documentary Challenge.\n\n2009 was the first year that teams managed to enter the search area. Team Galah suffered an engine shutdown just inside the search area and made an emergency landing less than 100 m from Outback Joe (although they were not aware of this at the time). Team Melbourne UAV were en route to the search area when high wind conditions flipped their aircraft causing it to enter flight termination mode. The airframe was lost due to high impact with the ground.\n\nIn 2009 the UAV Challenge was organised by the Australian Research Centre for Aerospace Automation (a five-year-long partnership between CSIRO and Queensland University of Technology), the Queensland State Government, and Boeing Defence Australia.\n\nThe 2008 UAV Outback Challenge was held between September 22 and 24 and had a combined prize fund of A$70,000. The prize for completing the Search and Rescue Challenge was increased to A$50,000. 51 teams from 8 different countries expressed an interest in entering with 17 finally qualifying for the event. As in 2007, teams failed to complete the Search and Rescue mission, with only Team Telemasters and Missouri S&T UAV teams passing the stringent flight scrutineering to begin the S & R Mission. Missouri S&T crashed on takeoff, and Team Telemasters aborted shortly after takeoff. No flights left the airport for the search area.\n\nIn 2008 the UAV Challenge was organised by the Australian Research Centre for Aerospace Automation (a five-year-long partnership between CSIRO and Queensland University of Technology), the Queensland State Government, and Boeing Defence Australia.\n\nThe first event was held between September 24 and 27. It attracted interest from 43 teams from 6 countries of whom 20 submitted full entries. No teams passed flight scrutineering although Team Dionysus from the USA did demonstrate some autonomous flight at the airport. MUROC I, a high school team from Mueller College, won the inaugural Payload Delivery Challenge.\n\nIn 2007 the UAV Challenge was organised by the Australian Research Centre for Aerospace Automation (a five-year-long partnership between CSIRO and Queensland University of Technology), the Queensland State Government, and Boeing Defence Australia.\n\n\n"}

The name 'uncorrelated asymmetry' is due to John Maynard Smith who called payoff relevant asymmetries in games with similar roles for each player 'correlated asymmetries' (note that any game with correlated asymmetries must also have uncorrelated asymmetries). \n\nThe explanation of an uncorrelated asymmetry usually makes reference to \"informational asymmetry\". Which may confuse some readers, since, games which may have uncorrelated asymmetries are still games of complete information . What differs between the same game with and without an uncorrelated asymmetry is whether the players know which role they have been assigned. If players in a symmetric game know whether they are Player 1, Player 2, \"etc.\" (or row vs. column player in a bimatrix game) then an uncorrelated asymmetry exists. If the players do not know which player they are then no uncorrelated asymmetry exists. The information asymmetry is that one player believes he is player 1 and the other believes he is player 2. Therefore, \"informational asymmetry\" does not refer to knowledge in the sense of an information set in an extensive form game.\n\nThe concept of uncorrelated asymmetries is important in determining which Nash equilibria are evolutionarily stable strategies in discoordination games such as the game of chicken. In these games the mixing Nash is the ESS if there is no uncorrelated asymmetry, and the pure conditional Nash equilibria are ESSes when there is an uncorrelated asymmetry. \n\nThe usual applied example of an uncorrelated asymmetry is territory ownership in the hawk-dove game. Even if the two players (\"owner\" and \"intruder\") have the same payoffs (i.e., the game is payoff symmetric), the territory owner will play Hawk, and the intruder Dove, in what is known as the 'Bourgeois strategy' (the reverse is also an ESS known as the 'anti-bourgeois strategy', but makes little biological sense).\n\nMaynard Smith, J (1982) Evolution and the Theory of Games Cambridge University Press. \n\n"}

The medium has been popular in the country since the 1980s, but little local development had taken place until the turn of the 21st century. As the country has been producing a large number of engineers since the early 2010s, many of which specialized in electronics, industry and information technology, the local video game industry has been booming.\n\nBecause video games and consoles have traditionally been released in Colombia around the same time as they appeared in the United States market, the history of video game development in Colombia dates back to the late 1980s. Inspired by games such as the \"Super Mario Bros.\" franchise, young people started programming short game experiences. In the early days of the video game industry in Colombia, large enterprises developed games for foreign studios while smaller, independent companies built games mostly unnoticed.\n\nThe festival Loop was first held in 2006. Now a popular yearly event, the festival organized by Oscar Andrade was one of the first entertainment media events that allowed developers to showcase themselves and their works. The game industry in Colombia received a large boost in 2009 due to roundtable discussions by the Telecommunications Research Center. The company freely exchanged information in order to support the growth of the local ICT industry. Founder of Immersion Games Ernasto Galvez was chosen as a guest speaker at the first Forum of Digital Content, which opened the door for various small game studios.\n\nSince 2009, the growth and internationalization of the video game industry in Colombia has been supported by government entity Proexport Colombia. In January 2012, the sector was added to the country's \"Vive Digital Plan,\" which seeks to improve the country's digital infrastructure.\n\nNineteen Colombian video game companies have attended the 2012 Game Developers Conference, five of which were able to surprise American journalists and international buyers by showing off an unexpected amount of quality. The companies present at the event came back with various business deals.\n\nThe digital-content industry of Colombia, which includes video games as well as other applications, recorded exports of 7 million USD in 2011 and 19 million USD in 2012. \"Entrepreneurial innovation system\" Ruta N promotes innovative business based on technology in Medellin, while Colombia 3.0 is a national summit of digital content held yearly in Bogota. Non-profit organization Colombian chapter of the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) is a key player, focusing on fostering game-development in the country.\n\nIn 2015, educational video games were released in Colombia that were designed to help children learn about a few of the country's many ethnic groups. The video games were released in order to \"contribute to the preservation of native culture,\" as video games are considered \"the language children use today.\"\n\nJairo Nieto of Brainz Games has stated that the Colombian video game industry started to evolve rapidly when companies such as Apple and Google opened their mobile platforms to independent developers. Furthermore, according to Nieto, \"[Government] support is invaluable for the growth of the game industry of Colombia.\" Though the Colombian government's financial support of the sector has been viewed positively by local gamers, this is mostly because the local government focuses specifically on public relations by creating events and contests.\n\n"}
