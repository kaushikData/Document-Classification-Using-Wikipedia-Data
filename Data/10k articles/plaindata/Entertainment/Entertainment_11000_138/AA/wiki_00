{"id": "1258132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1258132", "title": "A Number", "text": "A Number\n\nA Number is a 2002 play by the English playwright Caryl Churchill which addresses the subject of human cloning and identity, especially nature versus nurture. The story, set in the near future, is structured around the conflict between a father (Salter) and his sons (Bernard 1, Bernard 2, and Michael Black) – two of whom are clones of the first one.\n\n\"A Number\" is an original work published in 2002 in association with the Royal Court Theatre of London.\nThe play was written during a time of public debate over the ethics of cloning. The cloning of Dolly the sheep, the creation of human embryos at Advanced Cell Technology, and the cloning of a kitten gave rise to controversy concerning possible human cloning.\n\nA Number is set in the near future where human cloning has become possible, albeit still looked down upon and possibly illegal. \n\nBernard 2 discovers that he is actually a clone of his \"brother\" (Bernard 1), who was sent to a clinical home years before by his father (Salter) after the suicide of his mother, which left him in a constant state of fear and pain. Salter explains that he agreed to a cloning experiment to try again at parenting another version of his son. But, unbeknownst to Salter, the doctors had unethically made several more clones. Salter decides that they should sue the doctors, which soothes the shaken Bernard 2. \n\nIn the next scene, angry Bernard 1 visits Salter for the first time since his childhood while Bernard 2 is away. He has learned about the clones, and is furious at his father for doing it. Salter then admits that the clones were meant to give him another chance at raising Bernard, without any of his many parental mistakes. Bernard 1 grows increasingly agitated, before threatening to murder Bernard 2. \n\nLater, after Bernard 1 has left, Bernard 2 returns, having met Bernard 1 in the park. He has learned the truth about the situation, and now hates Salter for what he has done. Bernard 2 decides to leave the country for a while, both to get away from Salter and because he fears that Bernard 1 might try to kill him. Salter tries to convince him not to go, or at least to come back soon, but Bernard 2 refuses, saying he needs to go. \n\nSome time later, Bernard 1 returns and tells Salter that he followed and killed Bernard 2 after he left the country. Salter, stricken with grief, demands to know the details, but Bernard 1 refuses to say anything. Bernard 1 then leaves and kills himself, leaving Salter alone. Salter then decides to meet the other clones of his son, starting with the one named Michael Black. Michael, who never knew Salter, is a happily married maths teacher with three children. He is completely undisturbed that he is a clone, and tells Salter that he does not care. Salter demands to know more about him, particularly about something personal and unique, but Michael cannot answer. Salter then becomes unsatisfied with what Michael can give him.\n\n\nChurchill gives no stage directions and no indication of a setting for the play. In the 2002 production, the stage was described by one critic as a “bare blank design” with “no relation to domestic realism.” The costumes of the play were as simple as the stage design. Salter always wore a rumpled looking suit, sometimes expensive looking, but sometimes not. The various Bernards usually wore jeans and a T-shirt, but sometimes a sweatshirt.\n\nThe play debuted at the Royal Court Theatre in London on 23 September 2002. The production was directed by Stephen Daldry and designed by Ian MacNeil and featured the following cast:\n\nLighting was designed by Rick Fisher and Ian Dickinson was the sound designer. The play won the 2002 Evening Standard Award for Best Play.\n\nThe play was revived at the Sheffield Crucible studio in October 2006 starring real-life father and son Timothy West and Samuel West. This production later played at the Chocolate Factory in 2010 and at the Fugard Theatre, Cape Town in 2011.\n\nThe play was revived at The Nuffield Theatre (Southampton) in February 2014 with John and Lex Shrapnel to huge critical acclaim. It transferred to the Young Vic Theatre in June 2015. Zinnie Harris will direct the play at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh in April 2017.\n\nIn 2004, the play made its American debut at the New York Theatre Workshop in a production starring Sam Shepard (later played by Arliss Howard) and Dallas Roberts.\n\nIn February/March 2009, the play made its Los Angeles/Orange County debut at the Rude Guerrilla Theater Company in a production directed by Scott Barber, starring Vince Campbell and Mark Coyan.\n\n\"A Number\" was adapted by Caryl Churchill for television, in a co-production between the BBC and HBO Films. Starring Rhys Ifans and Tom Wilkinson, it was broadcast on BBC Two on 10 Sep 2008.\n\n"}

{"id": "33961266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33961266", "title": "Alexander Nikolaevich Volkov", "text": "Alexander Nikolaevich Volkov\n\nAlexander Nikolaevich Volkov (Russian: Александр Николаевич Волков; August 31, 1886, in Fergana – December 17, 1957, in Tashkent) was an avant-garde Russian painter and poet.\n\nAlexander Volkov was born in Fergana, near Tashkent in the Russian Empire. His father, Nikolai Ivanovich Volkov, was a lieutenant-general in the medical corps, and his mother, Feodosia Filippovna Volkova-Davydova, by some accounts, was a gypsy camp follower. Between 1888 and 1900 he studied in primary schools in Tashkent. Between 1900-1905 Volkov was enrolled with the Second Orenburg Cadets Corps. In 1906, he started his college study in the Physics and Mathematics Faculty at the St Petersburg University, but abandoned it two years later to join the studio of Vladimir Makovsky, who at the time was an instructor at the Superior School of Art at the Imperial Academy of Arts. A big influence on his artistic development was his attendance at the private studio of M.D. Bernstein, where some of his teachers were Nicholas Roerich, Ivan Bilibin and Leonid Sherwood.\n\nIn 1912, Volkov moved to Kiev to train at the Kiev School of Arts.\n\nIn 1915, the painter married Maria Ilyinichna Taratutina (1898–1925). In 1916, after finishing his training, Volkov returned to Uzbekistan where he lived till the end of his life.\n\nFrom 1916 his style was post-Impressionistic and then neo-primitivist which derived partly from Russian sign painting. Initially Volkov was under the strong influence of Vrubel and Roerich. Then he started painting in the same way as early Kandinsky. After moving to Uzbekistan, Volkov's works became marked by the influence of Matisse, Derain, Gauguin and Van Gogh. Then he went on to experimenting in the field of near-abstract art and became close in his manner to Tatlin and Malevich.\n\nIn 1919 Volkov was named the first director of the State Museum of Arts of Central Asia, which had been given the former palace of the Grand Duke Constantine Romanov in Tashkent to house its collection.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1946, Volkov taught at the Tashkent School of Arts.\n\nBetween 1927 and 1930, Volkov was a member of a local union \"Masters of the New East\".\n\nIn 1931-1932 Volkov organized the so-called Volkov's Brigade of painters, art critics and journalists, with the purpose of creating objects and propaganda of art.\n\nIn 1934 Volkov went to Moscow to participate in his first big exhibition held at the State Museum of Arts of the Peoples of the Orient. After this exhibition, several of Volkov's canvases were acquired by the State Tretyakov Gallery and the State Russian Museum in Saint Petersburg.\n\nThat same year, Volkov's picture \"Morning in Shakhimardan\" was for the first time exhibited in the West, at the Soviet Art exhibition in Philadelphia.\n\nBetween 1934 - 1936 the political campaign of fighting formalism in art began in USSR. Volkov's art was declared formalist and anti-socialist. His canvases were labeled as counterrevolutionary.\n\nIn 1946 Volkov was awarded the title of the People's Artist of Uzbekistan.\n\nWhen the campaign against free-thinking artists, writers and painters began in the USSR following orders from Stalin, Volkov along with writer Mikhail Zoshenko, poet Anna Akhmatova, painters Alexander Osmerkin and Robert Falk was labeled as an anti-communist formalist and abstractionist. He was fired from all his posts, lost all his earnings and money, and was committed to living in full isolation.\n\nIn the following three years, all of Volkov's pictures were removed from the leading Russian museums. Indeed, until his death in 1957, the leaders of the Uzbekistan Union of Painters, after orders from Moscow, fully isolated Volkov from any contact with any painters, art critics and lovers of art who chanced to come to Tashkent. To anyone who wanted to meet Volkov, they declared that the painter was too severely ill to see them.\n\nVolkov's style was a mixture of Modernism and traditional Russian art. Much of his work has been informed by Cubo-Futurism. Volkov, as an ethnic Russian who lived most of his life in Turkestan, often felt himself an outsider, yet was a keen observer of the daily life. This lends him a feeling of celebration and joy. Despite Vrubel's influence on his style and composition, he did not succumb to the former's preoccupation with tragedy. Instead, referring to his generation as \"nomads\", he found joy in the Uzbek land, and the desert was a metaphor for the familiar and melodic, so distant from Vrubel's agonies.\n\nIn his undergraduate years as a biology student at St Petersburg University, he was fascinated by the microscope and its revelation of the \"harmony, beauty and majesty of living matter\", resulting in the crystalline structure of his compositions.\n\nVolkov, too, learned from the Symbolist aesthetic, and was interested in frescoes and murals. He considered his work as a contribution to the natural architecture of Uzbekistan, although he only received one major fresco commission, that of the Turkestan Pavilion at the \"All Russian Agricultural Exhibition\" in Moscow (1923).\n\nReligious - both Christian and pagan - themes colour Volkov's work. For example, his \"Lamentation\" (1921) is nominally about the bereavement of Christ's mother, yet depicts three bare-breasted women that hearken to the local legend of a god whose death is lamented by these women. At the same time, this was a severely dissident action on the part of the artist during a period when the Bolsheviks were busy destroying houses of worship, which speaks to his adherence to the principle of freedom of individual belief.\n\nVolkov was keen to depict the quotidian rhythms and viewscapes of Turkestani life. He painted tea-houses (\"chaikhanas\"), caravans, roads, mountains. He would spend hours walking across the country, making studies and then painting them intensively, irritable at any interruptions.\n\n\"Volkov is moved by fire - by the purple and the gold. His skies are golden and the ground is multicoloured, and an unquenchable flame lurks beneath.\"\n\nIn 1923, the art historian Alexei Sidorov said of Volkov's work: \"...by their rich colours and rhythm provide a description of the East which cannot be found elsewhere. His art is European and leftist in form. In many works, there is more Paris than Tashkent, more Matisse and Picasso than an Eastern carpet.\"\n\nVolkov himself said of his work:The painting of the East is built chiefly on the primitive and on a painterly, decorative beginning. This is the basis of my work. Elaborating works of primitive flatness, I have introduced a whole system of triangles and other geometric forms and arrived at the depiction of man based on the triangle, that being the simplest of forms.In view of the politicisation of Soviet art and the demands of creating a nationalist art form that was distinct from modernism, Volkov used this argument to support his use of geometry (informed by Cubo-Futurism) as an overlay on an Uzbek sensibility.\n\nVolkov wrote verses in the 1920s that served to illustrate his creativity. Sergei Yesenin visited him in Tashkent in those years, and impressed by his poetry, encouraged him to join the Imaginists.\n\nIn 1925, Volkov's first wife Maria Taratutina died. He married Elena Semenovna Volkova-Melnikova (1901–1959) the following year. In 1928 his first son Valery Volkov was born, who became a famous painter and art critic. In 1937 Volkov's younger son Alexander Alexandrovich Volkov was born, who later became a painter and sculptor.\n\nVolkov died in 1957, and was buried in Tashkent. The concrete bust on his grave was created by his son Alexander.\n\nIn 1960, several of Volkov's canvases were acquired by the famous collector George Costakis. They now appear at the Costakis collection of the State Museum of Contemporary Art, Thessaloniki.\n\nIn 1967, Volkov's first posthumous exhibition was held at the State Museum of Oriental Art - 33 years after his very first exhibition there - organised by his son Alexander Alexandrovich Volkov.\n\nIn 2007, a grand exhibition \"Alexander Volkov. The Sun and the Caravan\" celebrating the 120th anniversary of the artist's birth was held at the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow.\n\nThe highest price paid for a Volkov painting at auction is £909,000 for the \"Listening to the Bedana\" (oil on canvas, laid on board, 97.5 by 97.5 cm), sold at MacDougall's in December 2011.\n\nIn 2012, the first solo-exhibition of Volkov's work outside the erstwhile Soviet Union was held at Christie's.\n\nThe most famous works by Volkov include the following:\n\n"}

It stars characters from the DreamWorks Animation animated film \"Madagascar\". It stars the main three lemurs; King Julien, Mort and Maurice from the \"Madagascar\" franchise and takes place in Madagascar and before the events of the first film making it a prequel. It is the second DreamWorks Animation show to be based on the \"Madagascar\" franchise.\n\nThe series debuted on December 19, 2014, on Netflix when the first five 22-minute episodes were released. Season 2 was released on October 16, 2015. Season 3 was released on June 17, 2016, and season 4 was released on November 11, 2016. During the course of the series, 65 episodes of All Hail King Julien, excluding the spin-off \"Exiled\", released on May 12, 2017, were released over five seasons. The fifth and final season was released on December 1, 2017. It is currently showing reruns on Universal Kids\n\nWhen King Julien XII (also known as Uncle King Julien), a very strict and cowardly ring-tailed lemur is foretold to be eaten by fossa (spelled and pronounced as \"foosa\"), he abdicates his throne in favor of his nephew, who becomes King Julien XIII, a fun, notorious party animal, who now has an entire kingdom of lemurs to lead on his own. While Uncle King Julien is gone, the new King Julien gets into various troubles in the company of his adviser Maurice, his head of security Clover, and his biggest fan Mort. All the while, his devious uncle returns and tries to get rid of his nephew to reclaim the throne. Aside from Uncle King Julien and the foosa, Julien deals with other threats like the mad fanaloka Karl, and Clover's twin sister Crimson.\n\nAt the end of the fourth season, King Julien is dethroned and forced into exile by King Koto and his army but successfully defeats Koto and regains his kingdom in spin-off, subtitled \"Exiled\". The fifth and final season takes place after Koto's demise; villains such as Karl and Uncle King Julien decide to give up their evil ways and start a new life. This all leads up to the arrival of Alex on Madagascar (setting the stage of the first film) just as Clover leaves with her husband, Sage Moondancer, on their honeymoon.\n\n\nThe series was announced in March 2014 as part of an agreement between Netflix and DreamWorks Animation, under which the studio will develop more than 300 hours of exclusive programming for the service. The series is based on the characters from \"Madagascar\", but is a prequel, set prior to the events of the film series. Danny Jacobs, Andy Richter, Kevin Michael Richardson reprised their roles from the previous Madagascar TV series, while Henry Winkler, India de Beaufort, and Betsy Sodaro joined the cast.\n\nThe series has been received favorable reviews. After the initial release of the first five episodes, Robert Lloyd of \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote in his review that the series \"succeeds on matters of style, script, timing and performance, not the number of individual hairs rendered in a patch of fur. And \"Julien\" delivers on all the important accounts.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "27814100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27814100", "title": "Angry Birds (video game)", "text": "Angry Birds (video game)\n\nAngry Birds (later remarketed as Angry Birds Classic) is a casual puzzle video game developed by Rovio Entertainment. Inspired primarily by a sketch of stylized wingless birds, the game was first released for iOS and Maemo devices in December 2009. Since that time, over 12 million copies of the game have been purchased from the iOS App Store, which has prompted the company to design versions for other touchscreen-based smartphones, most notably those using the Android, Symbian, Windows Phone and BlackBerry 10 devices. The series has since expanded to include titles for dedicated video game consoles and for PCs. A sequel, titled \"Angry Birds 2\", was released in July 2015.\n\nIn the game, players use a slingshot to launch birds at pigs stationed in or around various structures with the goal of destroying all the pigs on the playing field. As players advance through the game new types of birds become available, some with special abilities that can be activated by the player. Rovio Mobile has supported \"Angry Birds\" with numerous free updates that add additional game content, and the company has also released stand-alone holiday and promotional versions of the game.\n\n\"Angry Birds\" was praised by critics for its success for leveraging a combination of addictive gameplay, comical style, and low price into a viable franchise with long-term potential for profit. The game's popularity has led to the production of additional versions of \"Angry Birds\" for personal computers and gaming consoles, as well as a market for merchandise featuring its characters, a feature film and several seasons of television cartoons. With the \"Angry Birds\" series having a combined tally of over 2 billion downloads across all platforms as of January 2014, including both regular and special editions, the game was called \"one of the most mainstream games out right now\", \"one of the great runaway hits of 2010\", and \"the largest mobile app success the world has seen so far\".\n\nIn \"Angry Birds\", the player controls a flock of multi-colored birds that are attempting to retrieve their eggs, which have been stolen by a group of hungry green pigs. In each stage of the gameplay, enemy pigs are sheltered by structures made of various materials such as wood, glass, and stone resembling children's toy building blocks. The objective of the game is to eliminate all the pigs on the level. Using a slingshot, players launch a limited set of birds with the goal of either striking the enemy pigs directly or damaging their surrounding structures, causing the blocks to collapse and squash the pigs. The player must set the angle and force of the bird's travel by pulling back on the slingshot (using intuitive touch-controls in the mobile versions). The launch process is quick and casual, with no visible trajectory data, and a player simply selects a point in the X-Y field behind the launch post from which the virtual slingshot will be released. In various stages of the game, additional objects such as TNT crates and rocks are incorporated into the structures, and power-ups may be used to enhance the birds to attack hard-to-reach pigs. Also in the levels, players can unlock bonus levels by collecting golden eggs.\n\nThere are several different types of birds used in the game, distinguished by their color and shape. In the earliest levels only the basic red bird is available. As the player advances through the game additional types of birds become available. Some birds are effective against particular materials, and some have special abilities that may be activated by the player while the bird is airborne. For example, a yellow bird speeds up, a blue bird fragments into three birds, a black bird explodes, a white bird can drop an egg-shaped projectile, a pink bird can trap objects in bubbles, a green bird boomerangs back, a giant red bird (similar to the original red bird) does more damage to structures than their smaller counterparts, and an orange bird expands and inflates. The pigs also vary, with hardiness relative to their size. Small pigs are weaker and are easily vanquished by direct hits or by debris from the damaged structures, while larger pigs are able to withstand more damage before succumbing to defeat. In addition, some pigs wear hats or armor, making them even more resistant to damage.\n\nEach level starts with the quantity, types, and firing order of birds predetermined. If all of the pigs are eliminated after the last bird is launched, the level is completed and the next level is unlocked. If all of the birds run out and the pigs are not killed, the level is incomplete and must be repeated. Points are scored for each pig killed as well as for damage to, or destruction of, structures, and hefty bonus points are awarded for any unused birds. Upon completing each level, players receive one, two, or three stars depending on the score received. Players are encouraged to repeat any previously beaten levels in which the full three stars weren't awarded in order to fully master them and earn the full three star rating.\n\nIn early 2009, Rovio staff began reviewing proposals for potential games. One such proposal came from senior game designer Jaakko Iisalo in the form of a simulated screenshot featuring some angry-looking birds with no visible legs or wings. While the picture gave no clue as to what type of game was being played, the staff liked the characters, and the team elected to design a game around them. In early 2009, physics games, such as \"Crush the Castle\", were popular flash-based web games, so the Rovio team was inspired by these games. During the development of \"Angry Birds\", the staff realized the birds needed an enemy. At the time, the \"swine flu\" epidemic was in the news, so the staff made the birds' enemies pigs. Angry Birds was the studio's 52nd produced game and on its initial release, the game did not sell many copies. After Angry Birds was a featured app on the UK App Store in February 2010 and quickly reached No.1 there, it reached the No. 1 spot on the paid apps chart in the US App Store in the middle of 2010 and then stayed there for 275 days. The initial cost to develop \"Angry Birds\" was estimated to exceed €100,000, not including costs for the subsequent updates. For the iOS version, Rovio partnered with distributor Chillingo to publish the game to the App Store.\nChillingo claimed to have participated in final game polishing, such as adding visible trajectory lines, pinch to zoom, pigs' grunts, birds' somersaults on landing.\nSince then Rovio has self-published almost all of the later ports of the game, with the exception of the PSP version, which was produced under license by Abstraction Games.\n\nWhen Rovio began writing new versions of the game for other devices, new issues came to light. As the team began working on a version for Android systems, they observed the large number of configurations of device types and versions of the Android software. The number of combinations of software version, processor speed and even user interfaces was significantly larger than that for the iOS version. Ultimately, the team settled on a minimum set of requirements, even though that left nearly 30 types of Android phones unable to run the game, including some newly released phones. It was released on October 15, 2010. One month after the initial release on Android, Rovio Mobile began designing a lite version of the game for these other devices.\n\nIn early 2010, Rovio began developing a version of \"Angry Birds\" for Facebook. The project became one of the company's largest, with development taking over a year. The company understood the challenges of transplanting a game concept between social platforms and mobile/gaming systems. In a March 2011 interview, Rovio's Peter Vesterbacka said, \"you can’t take an experience that works in one environment and one ecosystem and force-feed it onto another. It's like Zynga. They can’t just take \"FarmVille\" and throw it on mobile and see what sticks. The titles that have been successful for them on mobile are the ones they’ve built from the ground up for the platform.\" The Facebook version incorporate social-gaming concepts and in-game purchases and entered beta-testing in April 2011; the game became officially available on Facebook in February 2012.\n\nImprovements for the game include the ability to synchronize the player's progress across multiple devices; for example, a player who completes a level on an Android phone can log into their copy of the game on an Android tablet and see the same statistics and level of progress.\n\nThe initial iOS version of the game included a single episode entitled \"Poached Eggs\", which contained three themed chapters, each with 21 levels. From time to time, Rovio has released free upgrades that include additional content, such as new levels, new in-game objects and even new birds. As updates have been released, they have been incorporated into the game's full version offered for download from each platform's application store.\n\nThe first update released on February 11, 2010 added a new episode called \"Mighty Hoax\", containing two new chapters with 21 levels each. Updates released on April 6, 2010 added the \"Golden Eggs\" feature, which placed hidden golden eggs throughout the game that would unlock bonus content when found, and a new episode called \"Danger Above\", which initially contained a single chapter of 15 levels. Two later updates added two more chapters to \"Danger Above\", each with 15 levels. \"The Big Setup\" episode, released on July 18, 2010, added a new chapter with 15 levels and additional Golden Egg levels. \"The Big Setup\" was later given two more chapters of 15 levels each.\n\nA fifth episode, called \"Ham 'Em High\", launched on December 23, 2010, in celebration of the game's first year in the iOS App Store. \"Ham 'Em High\" contained 15 American Old West-themed levels in a single chapter; updates on February 4, 2011 and March 18, 2011 each added one new 15-level chapter. \"Ham 'Em High\" also introduced the Mighty Eagle, a new bird that may be used once per hour to clear any uncompleted levels. The Mighty Eagle can also be used in previously completed levels, without the once-per-hour limit, to play a mini-game called \"Total Destruction\" in which the player attempts to destroy as much of the scenery as possible, both with the standard birds and the Mighty Eagle, achieving 100% destruction earns the player a Mighty Eagle feather for the level.\n\nThe Mighty Eagle is offered as a one-time, in-game purchase, and was initially only available for iOS, as its App Store customers have iTunes accounts with pre-linked credit cards. In late 2011, Rovio also added the Mighty Eagle to the Chrome App version of the game. Rovio has begun testing an Android update called the \"Bad Piggy Bank\" with the Elisa wireless service in Finland and T-Mobile, which allows users to charge in-app purchases, such as the Mighty Eagle, to their mobile phone bills. The service went live on Android with the release of version 2.2.0 in August 2012, using Google Play's transaction system, which allows both mobile billing and credit cards, allowing both Android phones and WiFi-only tablets to unlock the features. This version also added the powerups from the Facebook version and added an option to pay to remove ads, allowing Android players to enjoy the game ad-free as iOS players do.\n\nThe sixth episode, \"Mine and Dine\", was released on June 16, 2011 with 15 new mining-themed levels and a new Golden Egg. An August 24, 2011 update expanded \"Mine and Dine\" with two more 15-level chapters.\n\nThe seventh update, \"Birdday Party\", was released on December 11, 2011 to commemorate the second anniversary of the first release of the iOS version into the iTunes App Store. It included 15 new birthday cake-theme levels, as well as updated graphics and the addition of elements from the spin-off games, such as the scoring graphic seen in \"Angry Birds Rio\" and the introduction of the orange bird that first appeared in \"Angry Birds Seasons\". The update was later released for Android and Microsoft Windows. The eighth update was released initially to iOS on March 20, 2012 in a lead-up to the release of \"Angry Birds Space\". The new update included an animated tutorial, enhanced gameplay, all new UI graphics, and the first 15 levels of \"Surf and Turf,\" the \"Angry Birds Facebook\"-exclusive episode (see below), another 15 levels were added later, with the iOS version receiving the power-ups first seen in the Facebook version.\n\nOn October 9, 2012, the final chapter of \"Surf and Turf\" was released. Along with that, a new episode called \"Bad Piggies\" was released. This is to advertise the new Rovio game, Bad Piggies. Another update was released on December 11, 2012, the 3rd anniversary of the game's release, with 15 new levels to \"Birdday Party\" and 15 new levels to \"Bad Piggies\". The second set of 15 levels in \"Birdday Party\" introduced the Pink Bird to the game. 15 more levels were later released for the \"Bad Piggies\" episode on March 7, 2013. On the same day these final 15 levels were released, Angry Birds became \"Free App of the Week\" on the Apple App Store until March 14, 2013, and became an instant hit on the Top Free App charts on the App Store until March 18, 2013, when the app returned to the normal price of $0.99.\n\nOn June 17, 2013, Rovio teased on its Facebook page that Red, the main protagonist of the game, would receive an ability in a new episode. On June 26, 2013, Rovio released a YouTube video, uncovering three new facts: the episode would be called Red's Mighty Feathers, the update would come in July, and the Angry Birds app icon would receive a new design. On July 3, 2013, the update was released, with fifteen levels of all-new gameplay. Instead of knocking over the pigs' castles, the player's goal is to keep the pigs from stealing the egg and leaving the playing field with it. The pigs arrive in waves of complicated vehicles, and the only available bird is Red, whose new ability is to target the nearest pig. There is no score, and the three stars are awarded by completing three objectives in one try. The first objective is to finish the level without getting the egg stolen. The second is to pop all the pigs in the level. The third is to use fewer than or equal to a certain number of birds to clear the level. Because some people were skeptical about the new gameplay, Rovio later announced that they would add levels to the episode based on the original level style. On September 16, 2013, Rovio added 15 levels to the episode using the original style and these levels include manual targeting for Red Bird.\n\nOn November 26, 2013, Rovio added a 30-level episode called \"Short Fuse\" that transforms the Bomb's explosions into highly-destructive electrical pulses, adds a powerup that transforms any Bird into a Bomb Bird and 3 different potions that can change the pigs. On December 11, 2013, Rovio added 15 levels to episode \"Birdday Party\" (cake 4) to celebrate its fourth birthday. On March 4, 2014, 15 levels were added to \"Short Fuse\" and the power-up icons were updated. On July 22, 2014, a 15-level episode called \"Flock Favorites\" that is inspired by fans' favorite episodes (Poached Eggs, Danger Above, Mine and Dine, Bad Piggies, Red's Mighty Feathers, Short Fuse, Surf and Turf) was added.\n\nOn November 23, 2014, in partnership with (RED) and Apple Inc., an update to the app was released that was exclusive to iOS. In this update, there was an added special (RED)-themed Golden Egg level and Red's power from the \"Red's Mighty Feathers\" episode as a stand-alone power-up, that when purchased, can be used indefinitely (1 use per level) and 100% of the money went to the Global Fund to end AIDS. This purchase was only available until December 7, 2014.\n\nOn December 11, 2014, in honor of the Angry Birds' 5th birthday, an episode with 30 user-inspired levels was added. On June 23, 2015, Flock Favorites was added with 15 levels inspired by previous episodes. On December 11, 2015, in honor of Angry Birds 6th birthday, new 15 levels were added to Birdday Party. On December 11, 2016, in honor of Angry Birds' seventh birthday 15 more levels were added to Birdday Party.\n\nOn May 16, 2017, a dual virtual currency system was added to the game, in which currency is earned throughout gameplay (or accrued through in-app purchases) and can be used to purchase power-ups and other in-game items.\n\nSince its initial release for the Nokia N900 multimedia Internet device, and Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch mobile digital devices, Rovio has released versions of \"Angry Birds\" for additional devices. An iPad-exclusive version, \"Angry Birds HD\", was released with the iPad mobile digital device in April 2010. In August 2010, \"Angry Birds\" was made available to the Palm Pre phone running Palm's webOS operating system through its App Catalog online store. Symbian^3 phones received a version of the game in October 2010, which initially includes only the \"Poached Eggs\" and \"Mighty Hoax\" episodes. Angry Birds works on Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD.\n\nIn May 2010, Rovio announced plans for a version for devices using Google's Android operating system, with a beta version being released through the Android Market (now Google Play) in September 2010. The full Android version of the game was first released instead on GetJar in October 2010, though it was subsequently released on Android Market within days. Rovio officials noted that GetJar had a more global reach than Android Market, and GetJar's availability on other smartphone platforms (including Symbian) would make cross-platform promotion of the game easier. Unlike the previous versions, \"Angry Birds\" for Android is a free, ad-supported application, as paid applications aren't available on Android in some nations. An update called \"Bad Piggy Bank\" enabled players to buy out the in-game ads.\n\nIn October 2010, Microsoft suggested on one of its websites that a Windows Phone version of \"Angry Birds\" was in development. Rovio complained that Microsoft had not asked permission to make such a statement, noting that at that time it had not committed to design a Windows Phone version. Although Rovio asked Microsoft to revise its site to remove references to the game, a Windows Phone version was ultimately released in June 2011.\n\nNear the end of 2010, Rovio stated that it was developing new ports of the game, this time for devices outside of the mobile phone market. In January 2011, three of those ports launched. First, Sony announced the release of \"Angry Birds\" for its PlayStation Portable handheld system in the form of a PlayStation mini game that includes nearly 200 levels from the original game; the version is also playable on the PlayStation 3. Next, Rovio announced the release of a Windows version of the game on January 4, 2011, available for sale exclusively from the Intel AppUp center, which included 195 levels at launch and plans for exclusive features not available on the smartphone versions. One day after the Windows version was released, the Mac App Store launched, with one of the first offerings being its own version of \"Angry Birds\". Ports of \"Angry Birds\" have also been proposed for the Wii and Nintendo DS systems, with the former becoming realized through \"Angry Birds Trilogy\" (see below). A 3D-enhanced version of the game was proposed for release on the LG Optimus 3D in October 2011.\n\nThe popularity of \"Angry Birds\" has helped spread the game to other devices that were not initially designed as gaming machines. Barnes & Noble announced that a future update for its Nook Color e-reader will let the Android-based device run applications, including a port of \"Angry Birds\". In June 2011, Rovio announced plans to partner with Roku to include a version of \"Angry Birds\" on a new model of its Internet-connected set-top box, the Roku 2 XS.\n\nIn May 2011, an in-browser HTML5 version of \"Angry Birds\" was released in beta form. The game uses WebGL or Canvas and is distributed through the Chrome Web Store for use with Google's Chrome web browser. It runs on any WebGL- or Canvas-enabled browser, and features exclusive content when played on Chrome, such as exclusive levels and the so-called \"Chrome Bombs\". The version includes offline playability and features 60 FPS gameplay with a selection of graphics settings to accommodate a variety of hardware capabilities.\n\nIn October 2011, during Nokia World 2011, it was announced that \"Angry Birds\" would come preloaded in Nokia's Asha series of Series 40 touch handsets, aimed at emerging markets such as India, China and South Africa. In December 2011, Rovio released \"Angry Birds HD\", \"Angry Birds Seasons HD\" and \"Angry Birds Rio HD\" on the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet from Research In Motion. In January 2012, Angry Birds was released for devices using Bada OS.\n\nIn February 2012, \"Angry Birds\" made its official debut on Facebook. It is known as \"Angry Birds Friends\" since May 23, 2012. The version launched with two chapters from the original game, along with then exclusive \"Surf and Turf\" chapter. The Facebook version adds a number of new power-up items, with a maximum of two in use per level. For example, the Super Seeds power-up will make the launched bird larger and thus more powerful, while the King Sling power-up makes the slingshot stronger and able to launch birds higher and faster. Power-ups can be purchased in-game or given by friends who also play the game. \"Surf and Turf\" would later be included in the original mobile versions of the game, starting with iOS. The Facebook version features weekly tournaments among your friends, with the top 3 winners earning free in-game \"Bird Coins\" which can be used to purchase power-ups. There was a unique Green Day themed chapter, however it was removed in December 2012.\n\nAt the 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, Rovio and distribution partner Activision announced plans to bring \"Angry Birds\" and two of its spin-off games, \"Angry Birds Seasons\" and \"Angry Birds Rio\" to the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Nintendo 3DS systems. Bundled together as \"Angry Birds Trilogy\", the games were built specifically for their respective consoles, taking advantage of their unique features, such as support for PlayStation Move, Kinect, high-definition displays and glasses-free 3D visuals. \"Trilogy\" was also ported to the Wii and Wii U almost a year later.\n\nA motion controlled version of the game has also been released as a Samsung Smart TV App.\n\nReviews for \"Angry Birds\" have been mostly acclaimed. Chris Holt of \"Macworld\" called the game \"an addictive, clever, and challenging puzzler\", and \"Pocket Gamer's\" Keith Andrew said \"Angry Birds\" is \"a nugget of puzzling purity dished out with relish aplenty\". Jonathan Liu of Wired News wrote that \"going for the maximum number of stars certainly adds a lot of replay value to a fairly extensive game\".\n\nReviews for the first versions of the game that did not use a touch-screen, the PlayStation 3/PSP version and the Windows version, have also been positive, but with some disagreement over the different interfaces. Will Greenwald of \"PC Magazine\", in his review of the PlayStation Network version, said that the control scheme on these platforms is good, \"but they're not nearly as satisfying as the touch-screen controls found on smartphone versions\", and that the PlayStation 3 version appeared \"blocky and unpleasant, like a smartphone screen blown up to HDTV size\". Conversely, Greg Miller of IGN preferred the analog control setup of the PSP version, saying it \"offered me tiny variances in control that I don't feel like I get with my fat finger on a screen\". While giving the game a positive review, Miller concluded, \"There's no denying that Angry Birds is fun, but it could use polish – such as sharper visuals, a better price and smoother action.\" Damien McFerrin of British website Electric Pig reviewed the PC version, saying \"the mouse-driven control method showcases many distinct advantages over its finger-focused counterpart\".\n\nAngry Birds has also been described critically as impossible to understand the playing rules criteria by game critic Chris Schiller of Eurogamer.net, which has 'a contemptuous attitude towards its players, keeping them just frustrated enough not to switch off and play something else instead.'\n\n\"Angry Birds\" became the top-selling paid application on Apple's UK App Store in February 2010, and reached the top spot on the US App Store a few weeks later, where it remained until October 2010. Since release, the free, limited version of \"Angry Birds\" has been downloaded more than 11 million times for Apple's iOS, and the full-featured paid version has been downloaded nearly 7 million times as of September 2010. The Android version of the game was downloaded more than 1 million times within the first 24 hours of release, even though the site crashed at one point due to the load, and over 2 million downloads in its first weekend. Rovio receives approximately US$1 million per month in revenue from the advertising that appears in the free Android version.\n\nAccording to Rovio, players logged more than 5 million hours of game time each day across all platforms, with the series having 200 million monthly active users, as of May 2012. In November 2010, Digital Trends stated that \"with 36 million downloads, \"Angry Birds\" is one of the most mainstream games out right now\". MSNBC's video game news blog has written that \"[n]o other game app comes close\" to having such a following. \"The Christian Science Monitor\" has remarked, \"\"Angry Birds\" has been one of the great runaway hits of 2010\". In December 2010, in honor of the one-year anniversary of the release of \"Angry Birds\", Rovio Mobile announced that the game had been downloaded 50 million times, with more than 12 million on iOS devices and 10 million on Android. By January 2014, the \"Angry Birds\" series had reached 2 billion downloads, including \"Angry Birds\", \"Angry Birds Seasons\", \"Angry Birds Rio\", \"Angry Birds Space\", \"Angry Birds Star Wars I & II\" and \"Angry Birds Go!\" On Christmas Day 2011 alone, 6.5 million copies of the various \"Angry Birds\" games were downloaded across all supported platforms.\n\nIn the history of the Apple App Store, \"Angry Birds\" holds the record for most days at the top of the Paid Apps chart, having spent a total of 275 days at the No.1 position; \"Angry Birds Rio\" has been No.1 for a total of 23 days, ranking ninth on the list. In Apple's \"iTunes Rewind\" list of the most popular iTunes Store media for 2011, \"Angry Birds\" was the top-selling paid iPhone/iPod app on the App Store and its free version was the fourth-most downloaded. The game's two special-edition versions, \"Angry Birds Seasons\" and \"Angry Birds Rio\", were also ranked in the top 10 for paid iPhone/iPod apps, while its iPad-exclusive \"Angry Birds HD\" versions were the top-selling and top-downloaded iPad apps for the year.\nMattel also made a few board games based on the app. These were called \"Angry Birds: Knock on Wood, Angry Birds: On Thin Ice\" and \"Angry Birds: Mega Smash\".\n\nIn February 2010, \"Angry Birds\" was a nominee for the \"Best Casual Game\" award at the 6th annual International Mobile Gaming Awards in Barcelona, Spain. In September 2010, IGN named \"Angry Birds\" as the fourth best iPhone game of all time. In April 2011, \"Angry Birds\" won both the \"Best Game App\" and \"App of the Year\" at the UK Appy Awards. At the 2011 Webby Awards, \"Angry Birds\" was awarded \"Best Game for Handheld Devices\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1300724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1300724", "title": "Channel 1 (North American TV)", "text": "Channel 1 (North American TV)\n\nIn North American broadcast television frequencies, channel 1 is a former broadcast (over-the-air) television channel. During the experimental era of TV operation, Channel 1 was moved around the lower VHF spectrum repeatedly, with the entire band displaced upward at one point due to an early 40 MHz allocation for the FM broadcast band.\n\nFM was moved to its current frequencies in 1946. TV Channel 1's last location was 44 to 50 MHz.\n\nLand Mobile Radio and television broadcasters shared the same frequencies until 1948. This shared allocation was eventually found to be unworkable, so the FCC reallocated the Channel 1 frequencies for public safety and land mobile use and assigned TV channels 2–13 exclusively to broadcasters. Aside from the shared frequency issue, this part of the VHF band was (and to some extent still is) prone to higher levels of radio-frequency interference (RFI) than even VHF 2 (System M).\n\nNeither Canada nor Mexico allocated television frequencies until 1946, so the historical Channel 1 (System M) is exclusively a US allocation artifact.\n\nChannel 1 was allocated at 44–50 MHz between 1937 and 1940. Visual and aural carrier frequencies within the channel fluctuated with changes in overall TV broadcast standards prior to the establishment of permanent standards by the National Television Systems Committee.\n\nIn 1940, the FCC reassigned 44–50 MHz to the FM broadcast band. Television's channel 1 frequency range was moved to 50–56 MHz (see table below). Experimental television stations in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles were affected.\n\nCommercial TV allocations were made by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the NTSC system on July 1, 1941. Channel 1 was located at 50–56 MHz, with visual carrier at 51.25 MHz and aural carrier at 55.75 MHz. At the same time, the spectrum from 42 to 50 MHz was allocated to FM radio. Several commercial and experimental television stations operated on the 50–56 MHz Channel 1 between 1941 and 1946, including one station, WNBT (now WNBC, channel 4) in New York City, which had a full commercial operating license.\n\nIn the first postwar allocation in the spring of 1946, Channel 1 was moved back to 44–50 MHz, with visual at 45.25 MHz and aural at 49.75 MHz. FM was moved to its current 88–108 MHz band. But WNBT and all other existing stations were moved to other channels, because the final Channel 1 was reserved for low power community stations covering a limited area. While a handful of construction permits were issued for this final version of Channel 1, no station ever actually broadcast on it before it was removed from use in 1948.\n\nWhen the FCC initially allocated broadcast television frequencies, channel 1 was logically the first channel. These U.S. TV stations originally broadcast on the 50–56 MHz channel 1\nBy September 1945, additional stations temporarily granted construction permits to operate on channel 1 included: \n\n\"See also list of experimental television stations for additional channel one pioneers.\"\n\nIn 1946, prior to cable TV and the invention of public-access television channels, the FCC decided to reserve channel 1 for low-power Community television stations, and moved existing channel 1 stations to higher frequencies. Community television stations covered smaller cities and were allowed to use less radiated power. None of these stations were built before the FCC imposed a freeze on all television station construction permits in mid-1948, and removed the channel one allocations.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1948 TV stations in the U.S. shared Channel 1 and other channels with fixed and mobile services. The FCC decided in 1948 that a primary (non-shared) allocation of the VHF radio spectrum was needed for television broadcasting. Except for selected VHF frequencies in Alaska and Hawaii (and some overseas territories) the FCC-administered VHF band is primarily allocated for television broadcasting to this day.\n\nThe FCC in May 1948 formally changed the rules on TV band allocations based on propagation knowledge gained during the era of shared-user allocations. The 44–50 MHz band used by Channel 1 was replaced by lower-power narrowband users.\n\nChannel 1 was reassigned to fixed and mobile services (44–50 MHz) in order to end their former shared use of other VHF TV frequencies. Rather than renumber the TV channel table, it was decided to merely remove Channel 1 from the table.\n\nAs of September 2000, the Federal Spectrum Use of the band (which is regulated by the NTIA and not the FCC) was as follows:\n\n\nFCC (NON-Federal) allocations for the band:\n\nCanada did not start regular television broadcasts until after the US had decommissioned Channel 1 (44–50 MHz) for television use; CBFT and CBLT signed on in 1952. This TV channel was never used in Latin America, South Korea and the Philippines as TV broadcasting did not start in these areas until the 1950s.\n\nThe use of 45.75 MHz as an intermediate frequency within television receivers became commonplace after UHF reception became an option in 1953. Channel 1's signal on this frequency (over the air, or on analogue cable) could create interference internally within TV's.\n\nMost cable systems use frequencies below 54 MHz (VHF TV 2) for communication back to the cable provider from cable modems and digital apparatus, so any \"Cable 1\" channel needs to avoid operation on the original VHF Channel 1 frequencies from the pre-1948 bandplans. As such, \"cable 1\" is not related to the original 44–50 MHz VHF channel except in name. It operates always at some higher frequency - often with channels 00 and 01 merely aliased to 98/99 or 100/101.\n\nHRC and IRC systems increase the spacing between channels 4 and 5 to a non-standard 6 MHz, inserting \"cable 1\" between channels four and five. This non-standard spacing is rarely used, is not compatible with all television receivers and has the effect of pushing channel six partially into the FM broadcast band.\n\nChannel 1 is not the only \"missing\" channel. In most countries, no stations are assigned to UHF Channel 37 (608 to 614 MHz), which is reserved for radio astronomy. It remains on TV sets and tuners. There are a few Channel 37 stations operating in countries such as the Dominican Republic, Trinidad & Tobago and The Philippines.\n\nOther channels have been removed and reassigned as well, but only from the higher UHF bands. Channels 14 to 83 (except 37), from 470 to 890 MHz, were originally added by the FCC in 1952 for the rapidly expanding TV service in the United States. In 1983, channels 70 to 83 (806 to 890 MHz) were removed for AMPS mobile phone services (leading to one side of some conversations being heard on older TV sets on those channels). On June 12, 2009, channels 52 to 69 (698 to 806 MHz) were removed and will be reallocated for other uses. These same channels were reallocated in Canada on August 31, 2011. In South Korea and the Philippines, Channels 60 to 69 are no longer used. In Brazil, these channels are used only for linking (it will be phased out in the future) or government-based networks.\n\n\nIn Europe, other recently abandoned TV channels are being used for DAB digital radio, in VHF band III.\n\nIn the 1990s, it was decided that digital television would be limited to the current channels Channel 2 through 51, so that another 18 channels (Channels 52 to 69, 698 to 806 MHz) could be auctioned for private use by mobile phone and wireless network providers; four of the channels were to be reserved for emergency services such as police radios. Renumbering in this case is not relevant, as virtual channels can maintain the original analog TV station brand number, although the station transmits on another channel.\n\nThe ATSC standard allows for a major virtual channel number from 1 to 99, followed by a separator ('.' or '-') and a digital subchannel number from 1 to 99 (for broadcast TV) or 1 to 999 (datacasting or cable TV). As such, it does not preclude the creation of a virtual channel 1.1 or a virtual channel 37.1:\n\nHowever, the specification does not define any criteria to determine whom (if anyone) could ultimately be assigned the 1.1 virtual channel series for over-the-air broadcast in a local community; it merely defines a procedure to allocate virtual channels 02–69 based on holders of the corresponding (former) analogue NTSC licenses and designates virtual channels 70–99 for possible use to carry additional, unrelated programming via the facilities of these same broadcasters. (99 was used briefly by the now-defunct USDTV, for instance, although such applications are rare.)\n\nKAXT-LD of San Jose, California, won permission to use digital virtual channel 1.x, effective September 1, 2009, on technical grounds, asserting that existing virtual channel numbering (22.x) conflicted with that employed by educational broadcaster KRCB Cotati.\n\nCable television channel numbering is at the discretion of the cable system operator. North American cable television frequencies (analog System M) include a formally defined and allocated Channel 1. Cable TV's use of Channel 1 is rare and its frequency assignment is sometimes inconsistent.\n\nDigital cable subscribers in many areas, such as those serviced by Comcast and Charter Communications, can find video on demand content at Channel 1.\n\nCable subscribers in the New York City area receive local news channel NY1 on channel one (actually 101), served by Time Warner Cable and Altice USA. Rapid City, South Dakota NBC affiliate KNBN has also used a \"channel one\" brand and logo, based on its former cable converter channel position (over-the-air, KNBN is UHF channel 21, and KNBN is now carried by area cable systems on channel 10).\n\nSatellite television channel assignments depend on the receiver. Most FTA receivers will by default assign the first channel located during an initial signal scan as \"Channel 0001\" while package receivers sold by individual pay-TV providers will often use the SID, a virtual identifier sent as part of the satellite signal, as a channel number.\n\nThe original Dish Network DishPlayer PVR (model 7100/7200) displayed a PTV Services menu listing recorded videos and upcoming scheduled recordings if tuned to channel 1. This menu is internal to the personal video recorder and does not correspond to a broadcast signal.\n\nJapanese public broadcaster NHK General TV broadcasts on Channel 1 in Tokyo and other cities. The Japanese Channel 1 is assigned to the frequency 90 to 96 MHz, just above the Japanese FM band which is 76 to 90 MHz. Frequencies corresponding to Japan's channel 1 through 3 (90–108 MHz) are used primarily for FM radio broadcasting (88–108 MHz) outside Japan and correspond to cable 95–97 in North America.\n\nThe following commercial television stations operated on channel 1 on analog:\nOn digital television, their remote control key is 1 for historical reasons.\n\n"}
{"id": "43171960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43171960", "title": "Cinema of Bolivia", "text": "Cinema of Bolivia\n\nThe Cinema of Bolivia comprises the film and videos made within the nation of Bolivia or by Bolivian filmmakers abroad. Though the country’s film infrastructure is too small to be considered a film industry, Bolivia has a rich film history. Bolivia has consistently produced feature-length films since the 1920s, many of which are documentary or take a documentary approach to their subject. Film historian José Sánchez-H has observed that the predominant theme of many Bolivian films is the country's indigenous cultures and political oppression.\n\nThe first motion picture was shown in Bolivia on June 21, 1897, probably on a Vitascope. The press paid more attention to \"illicit acts\" committed in the dark theater than to the pictures themselves, and authorities made it difficult to hold screenings, some of which were held in people's homes. The Biograph was introduced in 1899, and by 1905 popular exhibitions were held in La Paz. A wave of documentary films emerged in the 1910s and 1920s directed by pioneer multitalented filmmakers working in an artisanal mode. Of note is \"La Gloria de la Raza\" (1926),directed by Luis Castillo in collaboration with anthropologist Arturo Posnasky. Optical effects and miniature models were used to depict the decline and disappearance of Tiahuanaco culture, and the film helped to spur the formation of Condor Mayku Films.\n\nThe first motion picture made in Bolivia was \"Personajes históricos y de actualidad\" in 1904. The only surviving film from Bolivia’s silent era is \"Wara Wara\", directed by José Velasco Maidana in 1930. The first sound film was \"Infierno Verde\" (\"aka\" \"\"La Guerra del Chaco\" , 1936) directed by Luis Bazoberry. The first color film was \"Donde nace un imperio\" (1957) directed by Jorge Ruiz.\n\nThe Instituto Cinematográfico Boliviano (ICB) was created in March 1953 to promote the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro in the wake of the national revolution of 1952. Waldo Cerruto was the ICB's first director. At the time, the government had a monopoly on film. The ICB created 136 newsreels between 1952 and 1956. In 1956, Jorge Ruiz became the next director of the ICB, and then was succeeded by Jorge Sanjinés in 1965. Two years later, the government shut the ICB down after Sanjinés exhibited his film \"Ukamau\" (1966), which authorities feared would incite Aymara people. Everyone involved with the film was fired, and the equipment and projects were transferred to Channel 7 - a station developed by the military government of General René Barrientos. Sanjinés and his crew founded a new group film, which they named after \"Ukamau\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Latin American cinema saw a common shift towards intellectualism and examining similar political themes, including underdevelopment and economic strife. Following Brazil's Cinema Novo and Argentina's Third cinema, New Bolivian Cinema sought to define a national identity. Ideologically, New Bolivian Cinema sought to make film for people together with people. The movement was a rejection of Hollywood style filmmaking, and is characterized by filming at real locations, working with non-professional actors, and inexpensive equipment. Jorge Sanjinés is considered a leader of the movement, with films like \"Yawar Malku\" (1969) and \"La Nación Clandestina\" (1989) which examined the historical and current treatment of Aymara peoples. Many filmmakers battled with both censorship by government authorities and mainstream media criticism within Bolivia, which attacked the films for their leftist social critiques and for focusing on indigenous peoples. For example, in 1953 Bolivian authorities tried to block \"Vuelve, Sebastiana\" from entering the Servicio Oficial de Difusión Radiotelevisión y Espectáculos film festival because “a movie about Indians couldn’t possibly represent Bolivia in a film festival in a foreign country.” However, the Bolivian Ambassador smuggled a copy of the film and entered it into the festival, where \"Vuelve, Sebastiana\" won first prize in the festival’s ethnographic category.\n\nIn 1991 the Bolivian government passed a law establishing the Consejo Nacional Autónomo del Cine (CONACINE). The council's film development fund lends \"up to one hundred thousand dollars for the production of films at a 7% interest rate and with only two years to pay it back.\" Filmmaker Jorge Ruiz felt the law was not applied effectively, and it remains difficult to secure the basic funds for film production in Bolivia.\n\nBolivian cinema transformed with the advent of digital formats. Computer-based editing allowed smaller, cheaper productions to be made. This led to a jump from an average of two feature-length movies a year being produced to over a dozen in 2010. Though production budgets can be much lower than in the past, independent filmmakers still have to make sacrifices to fund their projects. Patrick Cordova, writer, director, and producer of \"Erase una ves en Bolivia\" had to sell his car to finish the film. Many of the films made are still about social realism, but there are also genre films and auteur cinema. Notable directors include Juan Carlos Valdivia, Eduardo López, and Alejandro Pereyra.\n\nAccessible formats have also allowed Bolivia to foster a strong indigenous film community. The Cinematography Education and Production Center (CEFREC) is an organization dedicated to promoting film and video production among indigenous nations in Bolivia. Ian Sanjinés, Jorge Sanjinés’ son, founded the Center in 1989. CEFREC offers technical training in sound, film production, post-production, and script writing for the indigenous nations of Ayamara, Guarani, Trinitatio and Quechua. One of the indigenous filmmakers involved with CEFREC explains, “Video serves as a medium to save that which our grandparents can no longer tell.” \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1412140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1412140", "title": "Compilation film", "text": "Compilation film\n\nA compilation film, or compilation movie is a film edited from previously released or archive footage, but compiled in a new order of appearance.\n\nThe video footage can be combined with new commentary and new footage, but most of the footage of a compilation film consists of archive or stock footage that has been used in earlier, different movies. Sometimes it can also be older material shot again, but with a higher budget.\n\nThe quality of these types of films is variable. Sometimes the archive footage is just edited behind each other, without adding anything new. Because of running time limits some footage can be shortened or expanded with short, new footage in an effort to make everything seamlessly flow together into each other. These transitions are not always unnoticeable.\n\nSome of the earliest compilation movies were propaganda films. A famous example is the German Nazi propaganda film \"Der ewige Jude\" (1940), where only a small part consisted of new footage, namely the scenes with Jews in a Polish ghetto and the animated maps. The lion's share of the film was filled with old newsreel footage showing Albert Einstein, Anna Stern, Rosa Luxemburg and Adolf Hitler and clips from movies with and by Charlie Chaplin, Ernst Lubitsch and Fritz Lang. Other countries, including the United States and Great Britain, also made propaganda films with archive footage to present themselves in the style of a documentary.\n\nIn the years before the invention of video stores film companies released compilation films in which the best episodes of a film serial were put into one movie. One of the earliest examples were Walt Disney's \"package films\", based on his popular short animated films.\n\nFilm serials shown during a matinée were also sometimes edited into one long movie and re-released again. Today, most of these serials are only available in this form. A well known example is \"The Phantom Creeps\" (1939). During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970S many old film serials were re-edited and compiled into one film, for instance the slapstick movie compilation films \"4 Clowns\" and \"The Golden Age of Comedy\". Since in those days the general public had no other way to see these old movies (once again) these compilation movies were very successful and guaranteed theatres full of spectators.\n\nAfter television became popular during the 1950s some television series were compiled and edited into one film. Even people who had already seen everything on TV enjoyed experiencing the entire series again in one row. A famous example was the 1955 TV series \"Davy Crockett\", which was released as the cinematic feature \"Davy Crockett and the River Pirates\" (1956).\n\nWhen television started to repeating several old films and TV series on a regular basis compilation films became less popular. Films consisting of almost or nothing more than previously released footage, like \"Godzilla's Revenge\" (1969) and \"Trail of the Pink Panther\" (1982) left the audience with the feeling that they had been tricked into seeing the same material again, while expecting a fully original film with new, authentic material. The arrival of video and DVD, where several episodes or seasons of a series could be entirely collected, also took the need for compilation films away.\n\nAnother popular form is the musical compilation film, where clips from film musicals, concerts or music videos could be brought together into one format. Famous examples are the movies \"That's Entertainment!\" (1974), \"That's Entertainment, Part II\" (1976) and \"That's Entertainment! III\" (1994), all documentaries about Hollywoodmusicals, in which the narration is frequently interrupted to show full scenes from these musical films. Another example is the movie \"Moonwalker\" (1988) with pop singer Michael Jackson which mostly consists of older footage from his music videos and concerts, and some newer footage to give some resemblance of a story.\n\nA special kind of compilation films are movies where old footage is simply filmed again, but on a higher budget. A famous example is the first Monty Python movie \"And Now For Something Completely Different\" (1973), where most of the scenes are recreations of the most popular sketches from the first two seasons of the TV series \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\". So although the footage is new, the content is mostly not.\n\nIn Japanese anime, is a feature film that is mostly composed of footage from a television serial. These typically compress the plot of a story arc from about eight to thirteen broadcast hours to a bit more than two hours without commercials. Additional animation may be added that is either of a superior quality to that made for television or which changes story details, often making the ending lead to a sequel not suggested in the original show. Such films may be put on video or DVD, recently even without being shown theatrically.\n\nA compilation movie is often the most available source for the content of the TV series for persons outside the range of broadcasting. Release rights to other countries are often given for compilation movies well before the entire serial is similarly released. A compilation movie does not contain the characterization developed through the series, but it does not have filler material or extraneous plot.\n\nExamples of compilation films include the \"\" films \"The Laughing Man\" and \"Individual Eleven\", \"Space Battleship Yamato\" (1977) and the first three \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" films. The series \"Maison Ikkoku\" also derived a compilation film. Most of Gerry Anderson's \"Supermarionation\" series were made into compilation movies during the 1980s by ITC Entertainment under the package title of \"Super Space Theater\".\n\nAn anthology film looks stylistically like a compilation film and some anthology films are compilation films, but certainly not all of them. What distinguishes an anthology film from a compilation movie is the fact that a compilation film by definition shows archive or stock footage shown before, while the short segments in an anthology film are new material.\n\n"}

His father was one of the first U. S. Negro college graduates (Oberlin College, 1845). Beginning with an eight-dollar banjo purchased by his father, he was performing professionally by age 14.\n\nBland was educated in Washington, DC and graduated from Howard University in 1873. He wrote over 700 songs, including \"In the Morning in the Bright Light\" (1879), \"In the Evening by the Moonlight\" (1879), \"Oh! Dem Golden Slippers\" (1879) (the theme song for the long-running Philadelphia Mummers Parade), \"Hand Me Down My Walking Cane\" (1880) and \"De Golden Wedding\" (1880). His best-known song is \"Carry Me Back to Old Virginny\" (1878), which, in a slightly modified form, was the official State Song of Virginia from 1940 to 1997. It was retired and designated \"state song emeritus\" in the latter year, because of controversy over its racial nature.\n\nOften called \"The World's Greatest Minstrel Man\", Bland toured the United States, as well as Europe. Bland's earliest recorded minstrel performance was with the Original Black Diamonds of Boston in 1875. Beginning in 1881, he spent 20 years in London before returning to the United States. Bland toured Europe in the early 1880s with Haverly's Genuine Colored Minstrels and remained in England to perform as a singer/banjo player without blackface. Appearing as \"The Prince of Negro Songwriters,\" he was invited to give command performances for Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales. Music historian Alec Wilder calls Bland the black writer who \"broke down the barriers to white music publishers' offices.\" Bland was one of the most prolific minstrel composers of all time; he is reputed to have written over six hundred songs, though only about fifty were published under his name.\n\nJames A. Bland spent his later years in obscurity. He died from tuberculosis May 5, 1911, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Bland was buried in an unmarked grave without a funeral at Merion Memorial Park, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1939, his grave was found by American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) with the assistance of the editor of \"The Etude\" magazine, James Francis Cooke. His grave was landscaped and a monument was erected.

The hip hop artist was shot four times in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles, California, one of which was fatal. Despite numerous witnesses and enormous media attention and speculation, no one was ever formally charged for the murder of Wallace. The case remains officially unsolved, as police have searched for years for more details without success.\n\nIn 2006, Wallace's mother, Voletta Wallace; his widow, Faith Evans and his children, T'yanna Jackson and Christopher Jordan Wallace (CJ) filed a $500 million wrongful death lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department alleging that corrupt LAPD officers were responsible for Wallace's murder. Retired LAPD Officer Greg Kading alleged that Marion \"Suge\" Knight, the head of Death Row Records, hired fellow Blood gang member Wardell \"Poochie\" Fouse to murder Wallace and paid Poochie $13,000. He also alleged that Theresa Swan, the mother of Knight's child, was also involved in the murder, and was paid $25,000 to set up meetings both before and after the shooting took place. In 2003, Poochie himself was murdered in a drive-by by rival gang members.\n\nChristopher Wallace traveled to Los Angeles, California in February 1997 to promote his upcoming second studio album, \"Life After Death\", and to film a music video for its lead single, \"Hypnotize\". On March 5, he gave a radio interview with \"The Dog House\" on San Francisco's KYLD, in which he stated that he had hired security because he feared for his safety. Wallace cited not only the ongoing East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud and the murder of Tupac Shakur six months prior, but his role as a high-profile celebrity in general, as his reasons for the decision. \"Life After Death\" was scheduled for release on March 25, 1997.\n\nOn March 7, Wallace presented an award to Toni Braxton at the 1997 Soul Train Music Awards in Los Angeles and was booed by some of the audience. The following evening, March 8, he attended an after-party hosted by \"Vibe\" magazine and Qwest Records at the Petersen Automotive Museum in West Los Angeles. Other guests included Faith Evans, Aaliyah, Sean Combs, and members of the Bloods and Crips gangs.\n\nOn March 9, 1997, at 12:30 a.m. (PST), Wallace left with his entourage in two Chevrolet Suburbans to return to his hotel after the Los Angeles Fire Department closed the party early because of overcrowding. Wallace traveled in the front passenger seat alongside his associates Damion \"D-Roc\" Butler, Junior M.A.F.I.A. member Lil' Cease, and driver Gregory \"G-Money\" Young. Combs traveled in the other vehicle with three bodyguards. The two SUVs were trailed by a Chevrolet Blazer carrying Bad Boy Records' director of security.\n\nBy 12:45 a.m. (PST), the streets were crowded with people leaving the event. Wallace's SUV stopped at a red light on the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and South Fairfax Avenue just from the museum. A dark-colored Chevrolet Impala SS pulled up alongside Wallace's SUV. The driver of the Impala, a black male dressed in a blue suit and bow tie, rolled down his window, drew a 9 mm blue-steel pistol and fired at the Suburban; four bullets hit Wallace. Wallace's entourage rushed him to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where doctors performed an emergency thoracotomy, but he was pronounced dead at 1:15 a.m. (PST). He was 24 years old.\nHis autopsy was released to the public in December 2012, fifteen years after his death. According to the report, three of the four shots were not fatal. The first bullet hit his left forearm and traveled down to his wrist; the second hit him in the back, missing all vital organs, and exited through his left shoulder; and the third hit his left thigh and exited through his inner thigh. The report said that the third bullet struck \"the left side of the scrotum, causing a very shallow, linear laceration.\" The fourth bullet was fatal, entering through his right hip and striking several vital organs, including his colon, liver, heart, and the upper lobe of his left lung, before stopping in his left shoulder area.\n\nWallace's death was mourned by fellow hip hop artists and fans worldwide. Rapper Nas felt at the time of Wallace's death that his passing, along with that of Tupac Shakur, \"was nearly the end of rap.\"\n\nImmediately following the shooting, reports surfaced linking Wallace's murder with that of Shakur six months earlier, due to similarities in the drive-by shootings and the highly publicized East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud, of which Shakur and Wallace had been central figures. Media reports had previously speculated that Wallace was in some way connected to Shakur's murder, though no evidence ever surfaced to seriously implicate him. Shortly after Wallace's death, \"Los Angeles Times\" writers Chuck Philips and Matt Lait reported that the key suspect in his murder was a member of the Southside Crips acting in service of a personal financial motive, rather than on the gang's behalf. The investigation stalled, however, and no one was ever formally charged.\n\nIn a 2002 book by Randall Sullivan, called \"LAbyrinth\", information was compiled about the murders of Wallace and Shakur based on information provided by retired LAPD detective Russell Poole. In the book, Sullivan accused Suge Knight, co-founder of Death Row Records and a known Bloods affiliate, of conspiring with corrupt LAPD officer David Mack to kill Wallace and make both deaths appear to be the result of the rap rivalry. The book stated that one of Mack's alleged associates, Amir Muhammad, was the hitman who killed Wallace. The theory was based on evidence provided by an informant and the general resemblance of Muhammad to the facial composite generated during the investigation. In 2002, filmmaker Nick Broomfield released a documentary, \"Biggie & Tupac\", based on information from the book. \"The New York Times\" described Broomfield's low-budget documentary as a \"largely speculative\" and \"circumstantial\" account relying on flimsy evidence, failing to \"present counter-evidence\" or \"question sources.\" Moreover, the motive suggested for the murder of Wallace in the documentary—to decrease suspicion for the Shakur shooting six months earlier—was, as \"The New York Times\" put it, \"unsupported in the film.\"\n\nAn article published in \"Rolling Stone\" by Sullivan in December 2005 accused the LAPD of not fully investigating links with Death Row Records based on Poole's evidence. Sullivan claimed that Combs \"failed to fully cooperate with the investigation\", and according to Poole, encouraged Bad Boy staff to do the same. The accuracy of the article was later challenged in a letter by the Assistant Managing Editor of the \"Los Angeles Times\", who accused Sullivan of using \"shoddy tactics.\" Sullivan, in response, quoted the lead attorney of the Wallace estate calling the newspaper \"a co-conspirator in the cover-up.\" In alluding to Sullivan and Poole's theory that formed the basis of the Wallace family's dismissed $500 million lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles, \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"A cottage industry of criminal speculation has sprung up around the case, with documentaries, books and a stream of lurid magazine articles implicating gangs, crooked cops and a cross-country rap rivalry,\" noting that everything associated with Wallace's death had been \"big business.\" More recently, a Hollywood film was produced based on the Poole's investigation and Sullivan's book: \"LAbyrinth,\" starring Johnny Depp as Poole, is scheduled to be released in 2018.\n\nIn examining Sullivan's assertion that the \"Los Angeles Times\" was involved in a cover-up conspiracy with the LAPD, it is instructive to note that conflicting theories of the murder were offered in different sections of the \"Times\". The Metro section of the \"Times\" wrote that police suspected a connection between Wallace's death and the Rampart police corruption scandal, consistent with Sullivan and Poole's theory. The Metro section also ran a photo of Muhammad, identified by police as a mortgage broker unconnected to the murder who appeared to match details of the shooter, and the paper printed his name and driver's license. But Chuck Philips, a staff writer for the Business section of the \"Times\" who had been following the investigation and had not heard of the Rampart–Muhammad theory, searched for Muhammad, whom the Metro reporters could not find for comment. It took Philips only three days to find Muhammad, who had a current ad for his brokerage business running in the \"Times\". Muhammad, who was not an official suspect at the time, came forward to clear his name. The Metro section of the paper was opposed to running a retraction, but the business desk editor, Mark Saylor, said, \"Chuck is sort of the world's authority on rap violence\" and pushed, along with Philips, for the \"Times\" to retract the article.\n\nThe May 2000 \"Los Angeles Times\" correction article was written by Philips, who quoted Muhammad as saying, \"I'm a mortgage broker, not a murderer\" and asking, \"How can something so completely false end up on the front page of a major newspaper?\" The story cleared Muhammad's name. A later 2005 story by Philips showed that the main informant for the Poole-Sullivan theory was a schizophrenic with admitted memory lapses known as \"Psycho Mike\" who confessed to hearsay. John Cook of \"Brill's Content\" noted that Philips' article \"demolished\" the Poole-Sullivan theory of Wallace's murder.\n\nIn the 2000 book \"The Murder of Biggie Smalls\", investigative journalist and author Cathy Scott suggested that Wallace and Shakur's murders might have been the result of the East Coast–West Coast feud and motivated by financial gain for the record companies, because the rappers were worth more dead than alive.\n\nThe criminal investigation into Wallace's murder was re-opened in July 2006 to look for new evidence to help the city defend the civil lawsuits brought by the Wallace family. Retired LAPD detective Greg Kading, who worked for three years on a gang task force that included the Wallace case, alleges that the rapper was shot by Wardell \"Poochie\" Fouse, an associate of Knight, who died on July 24, 2003, after being shot in the back while riding his motorcycle in Compton. Kading believes Knight hired Poochie via his girlfriend, \"Theresa Swann,\" to kill Wallace to avenge the death of Shakur, who, Kading alleges, was killed under the orders of Combs.\n\nIn December 2012, the LAPD released the autopsy results conducted on Wallace's body to generate new leads. The release was criticized by the long-time lawyer of his estate, Perry Sanders Jr., who objected to an autopsy. The case remains officially unsolved.\n\nIn March 2006, Wallace's mother Voletta filed a wrongful death claim against the City of Los Angeles based on the evidence championed by Poole. They claimed the LAPD had sufficient evidence to arrest the assailant, but failed to use it. David Mack and Amir Muhammad (a.k.a. Harry Billups) were originally named as defendants in the civil suit, but were dropped shortly before the trial began after the LAPD and FBI dismissed them as suspects.\n\nThe case came for trial before a jury on June 21, 2005. On the eve of the trial, a key witness who was expected to testify, Kevin Hackie, revealed that he suffered memory lapses due to psychiatric medications. He had previously testified to knowledge of involvement between Knight, Mack, and Muhammed, but later said that the Wallace attorneys had altered his declarations to include words he never said. Hackie took full blame for filing a false declaration.\n\nSeveral days into the trial, the plaintiffs' attorney disclosed to the Court and opposing counsel that he had received a telephone call from someone claiming to be a LAPD officer and provided detailed information about the existence of evidence concerning the Wallace murder. The court directed the city to conduct a thorough investigation, which uncovered previously undisclosed evidence, much of which was in the desk or cabinet of Det. Steven Katz, the lead detective in the Wallace investigation. The documents centered around interviews by numerous police officers of an incarcerated informant, who had been a cellmate of imprisoned Rampart officer Rafael Perez for some extended period of time. He reported that Perez had told him about his and Mack's involvement with Death Row Records and their activities at the Peterson Automotive Museum the night of Wallace's murder. As a result of the newly discovered evidence, the judge declared a mistrial and awarded the Wallace family its attorneys' fees.\n\nOn April 16, 2007, relatives of Wallace filed a second wrongful death lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles. The suit also named two LAPD officers in the center of the investigation into the Rampart scandal, Perez and Nino Durden. According to the claim, Perez, an alleged affiliate of Death Row Records, admitted to LAPD officials that he and Mack (who was not named in the lawsuit) \"conspired to murder, and participated in the murder of Christopher Wallace\". The Wallace family said the LAPD \"consciously concealed Rafael Perez's involvement in the murder of ... Wallace\".\n\nUnited States District Judge Florence-Marie Cooper granted summary judgment to the city on December 17, 2007, finding that the Wallace family had not complied with a California law that required the family to give notice of its claim to the State within six months of Wallace's death. The Wallace family refiled the suit, dropping the state law claims on May 27, 2008. The suit against the City of Los Angeles was finally dismissed in 2010. It was described by \"The New York Times\" as \"one of the longest running and most contentious celebrity cases in history.\" The Wallace suit had asked for $500 million from the city.\n\nOn January 19, 2007, Tyruss \"Big Syke\" Himes, a friend of Shakur who was implicated in Wallace's murder by the Los Angeles Fox affiliate KTTV and \"XXL\" magazine in 2005, had a defamation lawsuit regarding the accusations thrown out of court.\n\n"}
{"id": "4164308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4164308", "title": "Muscle reading", "text": "Muscle reading\n\nMuscle reading, also known as \"Hellstromism\", \"Cumberlandism\" or \"contact mind reading\", is a technique used by mentalists to determine the thoughts or knowledge of a subject, the effect of which tends to be perceived as a form of mind reading. The performer can determine many things about the mental state of a subject by observing subtle, involuntary responses to speech or any other stimuli. It is closely related to the ideomotor effect, whereby subtle movements made without conscious awareness reflect a physical movement, action or direction which the subject is thinking about. The term \"muscle reading\" was coined in the 1870s by American neurologist George M. Beard to describe the actions of mentalist J. Randall Brown, an early proponent of the art.\n\nMuscle reading is also known by the names of those who have used it in popular performances. The success of one early performer, Stuart Cumberland, led to the technique's alternate name of Cumberlandism. The fame of the mentalist Axel Hellstrom led to it widely being called Hellstromism. Performers such as J. Randall Brown, Erik Jan Hanussen, Franz Polgar, and Kreskin have also used muscle reading successfully in their acts. \n\nIn 1924, magician Carl Hertz noted that \"mind-reading is nothing but muscle-reading. In all the cases where the mind-reader is supposed to lead a person to a hidden object, the spectator is guided entirely by an involuntary movement of the subject's muscles.\" The mentalist Washington Irving Bishop could drive a car blindfolded by muscle reading techniques. \n\nKreskin, one of the most accomplished performers of muscle reading in modern times, can tell a driver where to go in a car while a subject holds his wrist (or vice versa). In one of his books he relates the technique to the children's game within which a hidden object is located by feedback of \"hot\" or \"cold\".\n\nJune Downey had studied the practice of muscle reading from a psychological perspective. She has been described as an expert on the subject of muscle reading.\n\nThe technique relies on the assertion that the subject will subconsciously reveal their thoughts through very slight involuntary physical reactions, also known as ideomotor responses. The performer can determine what the subject is thinking by recognising and interpreting those responses. Muscle reading may be billed by some entertainers as a psychic phenomenon, where the audience will be told that by creating physical contact with the subject, a better psychic connection can be formed. In fact, the contact allows the performer to read more subtle reactions in the subject's motor functions that may not be apparent without contact, such as muscle control and heart rate.\n\nBecause muscle reading relies so heavily on the subject's subconscious reactions to their environment and situation, this technique is used commonly when performing stunts dealing with locating objects in an auditorium or on stage, and as such, it can be done 'clean' by the magician skilled in reading body language.\n\nPerformers often instruct the subject to imagine voicing instructions, which presumably amplifies the reactions of the subject, thus promoting the idea that the trick involves genuine thought tranference or mind-reading. However the subject who is \"thinking directions\" has a physical, kinaesthetic reaction that guides the performer so that he or she can, for example, locate a specific place on a wall on which to place a pin, without prior knowledge of where the pin should go.\n\nKnowledge of muscle reading is a technique that is also reportedly used by poker players to hide their reactions to the game, as well as to read the other players for potential bluffs and/or better hands.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26580964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26580964", "title": "Muslim social", "text": "Muslim social\n\nThe Muslim social is a film genre in Hindi cinema that portrays and critiques Islamic culture in India. It flourished in the 1950s and 1960s and lasted till the early 1980s. Muslim socials are divided into two categories: \"classic Muslim socials\" that explore nawabi culture and focus on upper class or elite Muslim families, and \"new wave Muslim socials\" that portray middle class Muslim families who experience economic problems, discrimination and communal violence. Muslim socials often include ghazals, qawwalis, Urdu poetry and expressions, and musical forms commonly associated with Islamic culture. However, lately the label has also been criticized for cultural ghettoization of minority cinema. Director M.S. Sathyu who made \"Garam Hava\" (1973), called it \"a skewed way to look at cinema. When there is no Hindu social or Christian social, how can there be a Muslim social\".\n\nThe earliest Muslim socials were made in the 1930s after the advent of sound and continued to be popular until the 1980s. The genre's popularity was partly due to the financial success of Mehboob Khan's \"Najma\" (1943), which became the blueprint for Muslim socials that followed, which too delved on social issues around Muslim families, no matter what the setting, giving the genre its title.\n\nBased on the life of Mughal Emperor, Jahangir, \"Pukar\" (1939) made by Sohrab Modi, known for his historicals, is the first notable film in this genre. Soon Hindi cinema based in Mumbai became the hub for Muslim socials, and it employed a large number of Muslim producers, director, screenwriters, music directors, lyricists and actors, most notably Mehboob Khan, K. A. Abbas, Kamal Amrohi, Abrar Alvi, Abdul Rashid Kardar, Saadat Hassan Manto, Ismat Chugtai, Ghulam Haider, Khayyam, Sahir Ludhianvi, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Shakeel Badayuni, Mohammed Rafi, Talat Mahmood, Shamshad Begum. Numerous films were made about the Mughals, including \"Humayun\" (1945) by Mehboob Khan, \"Shahjehan\" (1946) by Abdul Rashid Kardar, \"Taj Mahal\" (1963) by M. Sadiq, and \"Jahan Ara\" (1964), however the pinnacle of this royalty theme was \"Mughal-e-Azam\" (1960) by K. Asif, about Akbar, his son Prince Salim (later known as Jahangir), and the courtesan Anarkali, who itself became the theme of other films, like \"Anarkali\" (1953). Another popular theme of the period was centered on the nawabi culture, especially the culture of Awadh, present day Lucknow, it produced films marked by elaborate production, music and highlighting the sophistication of language and lifestyle, like \"Mirza Ghalib\" (1954), \"Chaudhvin Ka Chand\" (1960), \"Mere Mehboob\" (1963), \"Dil Hi To Hai\" (1963) and \"Pakeezah\" (1972) by Kamal Amrohi, starring Meena Kumari, which spent over a decade in making.\n\nThereafter the films in this genre shifted from regal that of fading Nawabi culture - \"Bahu Begum\" (1967). After experiencing its height in the 1970s, the genre descended to being a mere stereotypical and kitschy representation complete a \"kotha\" of a courtesan or a nawab stricken with poverty. One exception was \"Umrao Jaan\" (1981) directed by Muzaffar Ali based on 1905 historical novel \"Umrao Jaan Ada\" by Mirza Hadi Ruswa.\n\nMusical romances were also prepared in this genre which included H. S. Rawail's \"Mere Mehboob\" (1963), \"Mehboob Ki Mehndi\" (1971) and \"Laila Majnu\" (1976). More over reflecting on the changing times, themes shifted regal to middle class North Indian Muslims, and from mainstream Bollywood to parallel cinema or the new wave cinema, starting with \"Dastak\" (1970), \"Garm Hava\" (1973), \"Bazaar\" (1982) and \"Nikaah\" (1982). Besides that Ali made \"Anjuman\" (1986), and Saeed Akhtar Mirza made \"Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro\" (1989) and \"Naseem\" (1995). Gradually the genre lost both nuanced depiction of its hey days was imitated by the cinema many Muslim countries, and audiences as well, and few notable additions were made to this genre, and too sporadic.\n\nThe genre resurfaced in works of the screenwriter Khalid Mohammed, \"Mammo\" (1994), \"Sardari Begum\" (1996), \"Fiza\" (2000) and \"Zubeidaa\" (2001), Mohammed directed \"Fiza\", while the rest were directed by art film master Shyam Benegal, Benegal had previously directed, and \"Junoon\" (1978) set in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, stories with marked political content.\n\n"}

{"id": "779862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=779862", "title": "Replicator equation", "text": "Replicator equation\n\nIn mathematics, the replicator equation is a deterministic monotone non-linear and non-innovative game dynamic used in evolutionary game theory. The replicator equation differs from other equations used to model replication, such as the quasispecies equation, in that it allows the fitness function to incorporate the distribution of the population types rather than setting the fitness of a particular type constant. This important property allows the replicator equation to capture the essence of selection. Unlike the quasispecies equation, the replicator equation does not incorporate mutation and so is not able to innovate new types or pure strategies. \n\nThe most general continuous form is given by the differential equation\n\nwhere formula_2 is the proportion of type formula_3 in the population, formula_4 is the vector of the distribution of types in the population, formula_5 is the fitness of type formula_6 (which is dependent on the population), and formula_7 is the average population fitness (given by the weighted average of the fitness of the formula_8 types in the population). Since the elements of the population vector formula_9 sum to unity by definition, the equation is defined on the n-dimensional simplex.\n\nThe replicator equation assumes a uniform population distribution; that is, it does not incorporate population structure into the fitness. The fitness landscape does incorporate the population distribution of types, in contrast to other similar equations, such as the quasispecies equation.\n\nIn application, populations are generally finite, making the discrete version more realistic. The analysis is more difficult and computationally intensive in the discrete formulation, so the continuous form is often used, although there are significant properties that are lost due to this smoothing. Note that the continuous form can be obtained from the discrete form by a limiting process.\n\nTo simplify analysis, fitness is often assumed to depend linearly upon the population distribution, which allows the replicator equation to be written in the form:\n\nwhere the payoff matrix formula_11 holds all the fitness information for the population: the expected payoff can be written as formula_12 and the mean fitness of the population as a whole can be written as formula_13.\n\nThe analysis differs in the continuous and discrete cases: in the former, methods from differential equations are utilized, whereas in the latter the methods tend to be stochastic. Since the replicator equation is non-linear, an exact solution is difficult to obtain (even in simple versions of the continuous form) so the equation is usually analyzed in terms of stability. The replicator equation (in its continuous and discrete forms) satisfies the folk theorem of evolutionary game theory which characterizes the stability of equilibria of the equation. The solution of the equation is often given by the set of evolutionarily stable states of the population.\n\nIn general nondegenerate cases, there can be at most one interior evolutionary stable state (ESS), though there can be many equilibria on the boundary of the simplex. All the faces of the simplex are forward-invariant which corresponds to the lack of innovation in the replicator equation: once a strategy becomes extinct there is no way to revive it.\n\nPhase portrait solutions for the continuous linear-fitness replicator equation have been classified in the two and three dimensional cases. Classification is more difficult in higher dimensions because the number of distinct portraits increases rapidly.\n\nThe continuous replicator equation on formula_8 types is equivalent to the Generalized Lotka–Volterra equation in formula_15 dimensions. The transformation is made by the change of variables \nwhere formula_18 is the Lotka–Volterra variable.\n\nThe continuous replicator dynamic is also equivalent to the Price equation (see Page & Nowak's (2002) paper Unifying Evolutionary Dynamics).\n\nA generalization of the replicator equation which incorporates mutation is given by the replicator-mutator equation, which takes the following form in the continuous version:\n\nwhere the matrix formula_20 gives the transition probabilities for the mutation of type formula_21 to type formula_3. This equation is a simultaneous generalization of the replicator equation and the quasispecies equation, and is used in the mathematical analysis of language.\n\nThe replicator equation can easily be generalized to asymmetric games. A recent generalization that incorporates population structure is used in evolutionary graph theory.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25595854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25595854", "title": "Rio (2011 film)", "text": "Rio (2011 film)\n\nRio is a 2011 American 3D computer-animated adventure-comedy film produced by Blue Sky Studios and directed by Carlos Saldanha. The title refers to the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, where the film is set. The film features the voices of Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, Jemaine Clement, Leslie Mann, George Lopez, and Jamie Foxx. It tells the story of Blu (Eisenberg), a male Spix's macaw who is taken to Rio de Janeiro to mate with a free-spirited female Spix's macaw, Jewel (Hathaway). The two eventually fall in love, and together they have to escape from being smuggled by Nigel (Clement), a cockatoo. The theme song, \"Telling the World,\" was performed by Taio Cruz.\n\nSaldanha developed his first story concept of \"Rio\" in 1995, in which a penguin is washed up in Rio. Saldanha learned of the production of the films \"Happy Feet\" (2006) and \"Surf's Up\" (2007), and changed the concept to involve macaws and their environments in Rio. He proposed his idea to Chris Wedge in 2006, and the project was set up at Blue Sky. The main voice actors were approached in 2009. During production, the crew visited Rio de Janeiro and also consulted with an expert on macaws at the Bronx Zoo to study their movements.\n\n\"Rio\" premiered on March 22, 2011, in Lagoa, Rio de Janeiro, and had its general release on April 15, 2011 in North America, by 20th Century Fox. The film received generally positive reviews from film critics. Observers praised the visuals, voice acting, and music. The film was also a box office success, grossing over $143 million in the United States and $484 million worldwide. The film was nominated for Academy Award for Best Original Song for the song \"Real in Rio\", but lost to the other nominee, \"Man or Muppet\" from \"The Muppets\". A sequel, \"Rio 2\", was released on April 11, 2014.\n\nIn Brazil, various exotic birds are smuggled out of the country. In Moose Lake, Minnesota, a crate with a male Spix's macaw hatchling falls out of a truck and is found by a little girl named Linda Gunderson, who names him Blu. Over the next 15 years, Linda comes to own a bookstore. Highly domesticated and unable to fly because he is scared to, Blu is ridiculed frequently by the Canada geese that come by outside of Linda's bookstore.\n\nOne day, ornithologist Túlio Monteiro invites Blu and Linda to Rio de Janeiro because Blu, who is the last known male of his species, needs to mate with the last known female macaw. Linda accepts and they fly to Rio, where Blu meets a red-crested cardinal named Pedro and his yellow canary friend Nico. At Túlio's aviary, Blu meets Jewel, a fiercely independent Spix's macaw longing to flee back to the wilderness. The macaws are captured by Fernando, an orphaned boy, and a sulphur-crested cockatoo named Nigel, both of whom work for a group of smugglers led by Marcel, who wants to leave the country as soon as possible to secure a black market deal regarding Blu and Jewel. While Fernando has second thoughts about his actions, Nigel tells the macaws that he desires to exact revenge on \"pretty birds\" after his role on a television program had been ruined by one. However, because of Blu's familiarity with cages, they flee into the jungle. Fernando meets Linda and Túlio and helps them find the birds, while Blu and Jewel meet Rafael, a toco toucan, who offers to take them to his friend, Luiz, to remove their leg chain. He attempts to teach Blu how to fly, before they meet up with Pedro and Nico. Meanwhile, Nigel hires a horde of thieving marmosets led by Mauro to capture Blu and Jewel. Pedro and Nico then take the two birds to a Rio-style dance party, where they perform a duet and begin to fall in love, but encounter the marmosets in the process. The birds fight them off while the five escape on a tram. Fernando takes Linda and Túlio to the smugglers' hideout, where they discover that the birds have already been moved out. Marcel explains that he will use the Rio Carnival parade to smuggle the birds to the airport, as the other streets have been blocked off for the festivities. Meanwhile, Blu and the others meet Luiz, who is a bulldog, who releases the chain holding Blu and Jewel. After the two get into a heated argument, they decide to go their separate ways.\n\nPedro and Nico then witness Nigel capturing Jewel. When Blu and Rafael learn of it, they rush to the carnival to rescue her. Meanwhile, Linda and Túlio have spotted the smuggler's parade float and organize a rescue attempt for the birds. As Linda and Túlio pose as dancers in Spix's macaw costumes, Nigel captures Blu and the group. Linda and Túlio are unable to stop the smugglers in time and Marcel's group takes off in a Short SC.7 Skyvan. During the flight, Blu destroys his cage using a fire extinguisher and releases the other captive birds. However, Nigel attacks the macaws, injuring Jewel. Blu sends Nigel flying into the plane's engine using the fire extinguisher, causing the plane to fall. The smugglers flee the plane. Unable to fly, Jewel falls out of the plane's open cargo hatch towards the ocean. Jumping out of the plane to rescue her, Blu finally discovers that he is able to fly as he and Jewel kiss, and he carries her to Linda and Túlio for help. Later, they adopt Fernando and organize a sanctuary to protect the jungle from smugglers. Blu and Jewel eventually raise three children together, and fly above the jungle, joined by Linda, Luiz, and Túlio in a hang-glider. Meanwhile, Nigel survives the plane crash but is ridiculed for his loss of feathers by Mauro, and the smugglers are sent to prison.\n\n\nSaldanha first had the idea for the film in 1995, involving a penguin being washed up on the beaches of Ipanema; it was changed to the current story after he learned of \"Happy Feet\" and \"Surf's Up\" (two other films involving penguins) being produced. He pitched the idea to Chris Wedge at Blue Sky in 2006. Saldanha showed the animators maps and books with geographic landmarks and measurements, from which they built a digital version of Rio. Later, a group of artists from the company visited Rio to see the various story locations. The animators also met with an expert on macaws at the Bronx Zoo to gain insight into their movement and personalities. Saldanha himself is a Brazilian from Rio de Janeiro; such elements of Brazilian culture and landmarks were also influenced from Saldanha growing up in Brazil.\n\nThe lead voice actors were approached in 2009. Jemaine Clement was approached to do the film after seeing test shots of his character Nigel doing a speech from \"Flight of the Conchords\", which was done prior to a script being finalized. Neil Patrick Harris was supposed to voice Blu, but had other commitments outside production; he was later replaced by Jesse Eisenberg. Eisenberg was asked during the filming of \"The Social Network\" if he would do his voice recording on the weekends, and he agreed after reading the script, saying: \"It was the perfect antidote to get out of the mindset of my character in \"Social Network\" who was so severe, and in some ways so joyless.\"\n\nFor music, they brought on board Sérgio Mendes to act as music guru and online living library. He in turn was able to reach out to artists such as will.i.am and Carlinhos Brown to provide music for the film.\n\nEisenberg and Anne Hathaway, who voiced Jewel, had acted together before when both were still teenagers, when they played siblings in the short-lived 1999 TV show \"Get Real\". Hathaway stated in an interview that she didn't see Eisenberg during production of \"Rio\" except \"socially throughout the process,\" but that she was \"very happy for all of his success.\"\n\nOn March 18, 2011, Brazilian-English singer-songwriter Taio Cruz released a music video and theme song named \"Telling the World\" on YouTube for the soundtrack.\n\n\"Rio: Music from the Motion Picture\" was released in the United States by 20th Century Fox on March 29, 2011, for digital download and by Interscope Records on April 5, 2011, in Audio CD format.\n\nIn the Brazilian edition some songs gained a Portuguese version performed by famous Brazilian artists such Ivete Sangalo (replacing Ester Dean in \"Take You to Rio (Remix)\") and Carlinhos Brown (replacing Jamie Foxx in \"Fly Love\"). \"Real in Rio\" became \"Favo de Mel\" (Honeycomb) but it was performed by the same artists as the English version.\n\nThe film score of \"Rio\" was composed by John Powell and was released on April 19, 2011, by Varèse Sarabande Records.\n\nThe world premiere of \"Rio\" took place on March 22, 2011, at a Cinépolis theater in Lagoa, Rio de Janeiro. The United States premiere was on April 10, 2011, at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California, and was released throughout the country five days later. Since May 2009, it had been scheduled to be released in the United States on April 8, 2011, but in December 2010, it was rescheduled a week later to April 15, 2011. Pixar Animation Studios cancelled the release of their planned 2012 film \"Newt\" because of the similarity of its plotline to \"Rio\".\n\nIn April 2011, Oreo announced its special edition Oreo cookies with blue cream in promotion of the film. The promotion included stickers inside each package of cookies. Two types of contest were also announced: first, by completing an album of stickers, consumers could win three movie passes and medium snack bar combos; second, by finding winning stickers in packages with prizes including a trip to Rio de Janeiro, backpacks, cinema passes for a year, and 3D glasses. The promotion ended on May 30, 2011. The promotion is available in Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia.\n\nOn January 27, 2011, Rovio Mobile announced a partnership with 20th Century Fox to promote the film. The game \"Angry Birds Rio\" was released in March 2011 on the Android Market and the Apple App Store with 50 levels. Rovio released more levels throughout 2011. With the DVD and Blu-ray release, Rovio and 20th Century Fox announced that they were going to start selling Rio Plush Toys in the Angry Birds Online Store and the DVD and Blu-ray comes with a code for 15 Hidden Levels, along with 3 Angry Birds Rio Videos. Also, McDonald's ran a promotion with Rio toys in their Happy Meals.\n\nIn February 2011, the MPAA gave the film a PG rating for \"mild off-color humor\". The producers, displeased by this rating, resubmitted an edited version of the film to the ratings board one month later, and the MPAA changed the film to a G rating.\n\nAs a tribute to the country where most of the story is set and where the director was born, \"Rio\" was first released for home video in Brazil, on both DVD and Blu-ray, on July 7, 2011. The North American release date was August 2, 2011, and the Australian release date was September 28, 2011. As of June 2014, a total of 12 million Blu-ray and DVD units had been sold worldwide.\n\n\"Rio\" is available in 4 different packages: a 4-disc \"Party Edition\" combination package (3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy), a 3-disc \"Party Edition\" combination package (Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy), a 2-disc \"Party Edition\" combination package (DVD and Digital Copy), and a single disc DVD. The \"Digital Copy\" included with the 3-disc combination package is a separate disc that allows users to download a copy of the film to a computer through iTunes or Windows Media Player software. The 3-disc combination package also comes with an hour of bonus features.\n\nA video game based on the film was released on April 12, 2011, for the Wii, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, and the Xbox 360. Another game, \"Angry Birds Rio\", was released in March 2011 for various mobile and desktop systems.\n\n\"Rio: The 4-D Experience\" is a 12-minute 4D film shown at various 4-D theatres over the world. Produced by SimEx-Iwerks, it premiered on September 27, 2013 at the San Diego Zoo 4-D Theater. Since May 24, 2014, it is being shown at the 5D Cinema at the revived Kentucky Kingdom. Since July 2014, it is being shown at the 4D Special FX Theater at Moody Gardens. And since October 25, 2014, it is being shown at the Roxy Theatre at Warner Bros. Movie World.\n\n\"Rio\" made $143,619,809 in North America, along with $341,015,951 in other territories for a total of $484,635,760 worldwide, becoming the 13th highest-grossing film of 2011 and the 107th highest-grossing film of all time. It was the first film of 2011 to pass the $400-million mark.\n\n\"Rio\" debuted with $39,225,962 during its opening weekend on approximately 6,400 screens at 3,826 theaters. It ranked No. 1 at the box office surpassing the other new wide release, \"Scream 4\", which ranked #2. This was the highest-grossing opening weekend of 2011 that far, finishing the year at sixteenth. It also scored the largest opening weekend in April for an animated feature, and the sixth largest in April overall. On its second weekend (Easter weekend) it retained first place at the box office, dropping only 33% to $26.3 million, therefore surpassing that weekend's releases, Tyler Perry's \"Madea's Big Happy Family\" ($25.1 million), \"Water for Elephants\" ($16.8 million), and \"African Cats\" ($6 million), which ranked second, third, and sixth, respectively. \"Rio\"s income of $143.6 million made it Blue Sky's second lowest box office result at the time, surpassing only \"Robots\", and the 18th highest grossing film of the year in North America.\n\nOn its first weekend overseas (the weekend before its release in North America) it topped the box office with $54.9 million from 11,714 screens in 72 countries. On its second weekend it earned $55.4 million, still on top of the overseas box office and on its third weekend it remained at the summit of the box office, grossing an estimated $44.3 million. It therefore marked the second film that succeeded in topping the overseas box office three times in 2011, joining \"Tangled\", although it is the only one that did it on three consecutive weekends.\n\nIn Brazil, the film's main setting and Saldanha's homeland, \"Rio\" was the largest release ever with over 1,000 screens. Its opening weekend gross of $8.4 million was the biggest ever for an American film (surpassed one year later by \"\"). On its second weekend it earned $7.2 million, falling just 14% from its opening. It then delivered the highest-grossing third weekend in history with $6.3 million (a 12% decline). \"Rio\" finished 2011 with a final gross of $36.8 million (R$68.7 million), the second highest income of the year after \"\".\n\nIn Russia and the CIS, it topped the box office with $11.3 million during its opening weekend (including weekday previews), surpassing \"Tangled\" for the largest all-time opening of a non-sequel animated feature. It earned $24.7 million in total, marking the fourth largest animated film of all time. In Venezuela, it has earned $8 million, marking the second-highest-grossing film of all time behind \"Ice Age 3\" ($11.6 million). In Uruguay, it is the fourth highest-grossing film of all time with $754,820 after \"Titanic\" ($2.1 million), \"Avatar\" ($1.1 million), and \"Ice Age 3\" ($1 million). In Peru, grossing $3.8 million, it is the third-largest animated feature behind \"Ice Age 3\" and \"Shrek Forever After\", and the fourth highest-grossing film of all time behind these two and \"Avatar\". In India, it grossed 10,000,000 in three weeks making the biggest animated opener ever.\n\n\"Rio\" received positive reviews from film critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 71% rating based on 147 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's consensus is: \"This straightforward movie hits great heights thanks to its colorful visual palette, catchy music, and perfect vocal performances.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has an average score of 63 out of 100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nOwen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a mixed \"C\" rating. Gleiberman praised the animation in \"Rio\" and its music, and later went on to say that the film is \"less a Pixar-level pleasure than a busy, frantic, and overstuffed dessert of a movie.\" Betsy Sharkey of the \"Los Angeles Times\" gave a positive review and praised the film for its comic action and the voices, as well as the visuals.\n\nA sequel, titled \"Rio 2\", was released on April 11, 2014. Carlos Saldanha, the creator and director of the first film, returned as director. All the main cast, including Anne Hathaway, Jesse Eisenberg, Jemaine Clement, Jamie Foxx, will.i.am, Tracy Morgan, George Lopez, Jake T. Austin, Leslie Mann, and Rodrigo Santoro, reprised their roles. New cast includes Andy García, Bruno Mars, Kristin Chenoweth, Rita Moreno, Amandla Stenberg, Rachel Crow, Pierce Gagnon, and Natalie Morales. The sequel follows Blu, Jewel and their three kids on a venture into the Amazon where they try to live like real birds. Eventually, they find Jewel's long-lost father Eduardo, who is in hiding with a tribe of other Spix's macaw. At first everything seems perfect, but Blu is having trouble adapting to the wild. Eventually, they discover that the Amazon is under threat, and that Blu and Jewel's old nemesis, Nigel the cockatoo, is back for revenge.\n\n"}

It was decided that every member of the Federation would provide their armed forces to build a single military unit with the goal to protect the Earth and settle eventual conflicts. Thus it was no longer possible for any individual group to use military force to resolve their personal aim.\n\nWithin several years, the Federation created a Global Defense Network, known as \"Overmind\". Actually, it was a super intelligent mainframe computer - a unique work of hundreds of the most gifted scientists on the planet. It was operated by an intelligent software and consisted of 22 military bases worldwide located far from populated areas ready to act in case of the conflict. Since then, no machinery was ever controlled by man. Only the formal approval to activate \"Overmind\" had to be given by each UFSC representative.\n\nGlobal society, however, carried its burdens. People suffering from spiritual emptiness sought refuge in organizations that offered salvation. The most influential among them was the \"Beho-Sunns\". Charismatic leaders of the cult used their personal charm and rhetorical skills to attract more and more people. Their audience included every social group from workers, scienties, lawyers to elite politicians. Behind it all, there was the wicked plan to get hold of \"Overmind\". None of the Beho-Sunns followers knew that during their meditation seasons the cult gathered all kinds of information from their minds. Over years, the Beho-Sunns discovered much about Overmind's mechanics and were able to hack the software which controls Overmind.\n\nIt so happened that the Beho-Sunns leaders tried to hack Overmind, but due to sophisticated firewall protection, they failed. Consequences were fatal. The Global Defense System went out of order and malfunctioned. Members of the Beho-Sunns quickly recovered from their defeat and started occupying defenseless military bases.

It was met with mixed reception from critics and \"GameZone\"'s review stated that is a \"half-decent effort that doesn't live up to the legacy created by the game it mimics\", referencing the similarly titled \"Command & Conquer\".\n\n"}

The screenplay was written by Art Edler Brown and Josh Nick. It was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, taking 2 years to complete.\n\nJordan Sands (Victoria Justice) is an awkward and nerdy 17-year-old girl with a bad case of allergies, who just became the woman of the house after the recent death of her mother. Her father David (Matt Winston) is struggling to make ends meet, while her 14-year-old brother Hunter (Chase Ellison) drives the family crazy with gory pranks. They inherit their deceased mother's Great-Uncle Dragomir's castle in Wolfsberg, Romania after getting a package in the mail. After arriving in Wolfsberg, they meet the strange and steely castle housekeeper, Madame Varcolac (Brooke Shields).\n\nVarcolac discourages David from selling the property, but he ends up going on dates with and falling for the real estate agent Paulina von Eckberg. One day while snooping around Dragomir's lab, Jordan steps on a vial of strange liquid. Hunter manages to pull the pieces out from her foot, but Jordan's behavior changes, such as her allergies disappearing, seeing without glasses, and smelling things very far away. Hunter's friends explain that Jordan's behaviors are akin to those of a werewolf's, and that she is one either because of a bloodline curse, a bite from an infected person, or from getting blood of a werewolf. In Jordan's case, it was revealed to have been LB-217, which is short for \"Lycanthrope Blood\".\n\nJordan continues to succumb to the changes, having behavioral changes. After her date with Goran, the young butcher, Jordan turns into a werewolf, which Hunter witnesses. She flees and Hunter contacts his friends for help. They reveal that there is no cure they know of other than shooting a werewolf dead with silver. Hunter refuses to do this to his sister. His friends warn that if Jordan is not cured by the next sunrise, she will always be a werewolf, cursed to shift every night until the end of her life.\n\nThey find Varcolac, who reveals that Dragomir was also a werewolf and was the \"Wolfsberg Beast\"; protector of the castle and Wolfsberg itself. Vampires have attempted to take over the castle, but Dragomir stopped them before he was ultimately killed. Before his death, Dragomir was working on a possible cure to lycanthropy. However, it will take time to gather the ingredients. Paulina offers the siblings a ride home, but Jordan struggles in trying to resist her transformation. The car breaks down and the Vampires come out, along with Paulina, who is a Vampire. As it turns out, she killed Dragomir to get the manor and will now kill Jordan. Jordan and Hunter are locked in the trunk and brought to her hideout, where Jordan succumbs to the change and is restrained. Hunter leads David to the hideout as they witness Paulina attempting to kill Jordan.\n\nHunter suddenly turns into a werewolf himself; he is a part of the bloodline. The werewolves attack the Vampires before witnessing the rising sun. They use this to their advantage and kill them with the sunlight, with Jordan defeating Paulina in a final showdown. Jordan and Hunter return to the manor, where Hunter's blood is used in the antidote, which successfully cures Jordan. Varcolac is allowed to continue working there, and gives the Sands the money they inherited from Dragomir. Hunter also becomes the Wolfsberg Beast to take Dragomir's place.\n\nThe family returns to California where Jordan demonstrates a new confidence and power at school, and Goran transfers to be with her. David also finds a new love interest. In a twist, it turns out that Paulina was not killed by Jordan after all, and has moved to their neighborhood.\n\nThe movie ends as the cast sings ...Baby One More Time on karaoke.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics. The film currently holds a 69% approval rate on Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reviews. Felix Vasques Jr. of \"CinemaCrazed\" gave the film a positive review as well, stating \"\"The Boy Who Cried Werewolf\" ends up being a surprisingly solid family horror comedy that isn't as soapy or girly as I originally assumed it would be. Within the pandering to preteens salivating after Justice, there is also a solid however flawed and derivative story and some wicked special effects.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "14767442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14767442", "title": "The Killer Inside Me", "text": "The Killer Inside Me\n\nThe Killer Inside Me is a 1952 novel by American writer Jim Thompson published by Fawcett Publications.\n\nIn the introduction to the anthology \"Crime Novels: American Noir of the 1950s\", it is described as \"one of the most blistering and uncompromising crime novels ever written.\"\n\nThe story is told through the eyes of its protagonist, Lou Ford, a 29-year-old deputy sheriff in a small Texas town. Ford appears to be a regular, small-town cop leading an unremarkable existence; beneath this facade, however, he is a cunning, depraved sociopath with sadistic sexual tastes. Ford's main outlet for his dark urges is the relatively benign habit of deliberately needling people with clichés and platitudes despite their obvious boredom: \"If there's anything worse than a bore,\" says Lou, \"it's a corny bore.\"\n\nDespite having a steady girlfriend, Ford falls into a sadomasochistic relationship with a prostitute named Joyce Lakeland. Ford describes their affair as unlocking \"the sickness\" that has plagued him since adolescence, when he sexually abused a little girl, a crime for which his elder foster brother Mike took the blame to spare Lou from prison. After serving a jail term, Mike died at a construction site. Lou blamed a local construction magnate for Mike's death, suspecting he was murdered.\n\nTo exact revenge, Lou and Joyce blackmail the construction magnate to avoid exposing his son's affair with Joyce. However, Lou double-crosses Joyce: He ferociously batters her, and shoots the construction magnate's son, hoping to make the crimes appear to be a lovers' spat gone wrong. Despite the savage beating, it's revealed that Joyce survives, albeit in a coma.\n\nFord builds a solid alibi and frames other people for the double homicide. However, to successfully frame others when the evidence starts to go against him, he has to commit additional murders. These only increase suspicion against him however, and his mask of sanity begins to crumble under the pressure.\n\nIn 1976, the novel was adapted into a film of the same title, directed by Burt Kennedy and starring Stacy Keach as Lou Ford and Tisha Sterling as Amy Stanton. A 2010 version written by John Curran, directed by Michael Winterbottom and starring Casey Affleck and Jessica Alba premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2010, and was released in theaters later that year.\n\nThe novel is referenced in the Dead Milkmen song \"Sri Lanka Sex Hotel\", on their 1988 LP, \"Beelzebubba\". The song \"The Killer Inside Me\" by experimental hip-hop artist MC 900 Ft. Jesus is based on the novel.\n\nFilmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who worked with Thompson on the script for the 1956 movie \"The Killing\", praised the novel, stating that it was \"probably the most chilling and believable first-person story of a criminally warped mind I have ever encountered.\"\n\nThe post-punk/alternative-country rock band Green on Red titled their 1987 album \"The Killer Inside Me\" after the book.\n\nBruce Springsteen has stated that the idea for his 1995 song \"My Best Was Never Good Enough\" (on the album \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\") came from this book, specifically Ford's penchant for speaking in cliches.\n\nIn 2013, the Norwegian band The Launderettes released their album \"Getaway,\" which was inspired by the novel. The band uses the album as a \"means to end the story differently.\" \n\nLou Ford later appears in Thompson's novel \"Wild Town\" (1957). The Lou Ford character in \"Wild Town\" is a mirror image of the one in \"Killer Inside Me\". In \"Wild Town\" Lou Ford is also a sheriff, he also plays the fool, and he is also smarter and more capable than anyone else in the small town although he keeps it well hidden. He also prefers, and is usually able, to manipulate events rather than directly intervene. However, whereas in \"Killer\" Lou Ford manipulates events to further his own greed and lust, in \"Wild Town\" he manipulates events to bring about justice, to help people, and even to play matchmaker.\n\n"}
{"id": "41285610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41285610", "title": "The Press-Radio War", "text": "The Press-Radio War\n\nThe Press-Radio War in the United States lasted from 1933 to 1935. Newspaper publishers were concerned to maintain their own dominance of the news market in the face of the emerging radio networks. The Press induced the wire services to stop providing news bulletins to radio broadcasters, which then developed their own news-gathering facilities. In response the press launched political, economic and legal campaigns to prevent news being broadcast on radio, culminating in The Biltmore Agreement by which major networks were compelled to heavily restrict radio news coverage. However, broadcasters soon developed ways to subvert the terms of this agreement, including the use of newly established news agencies such as the Transradio Press Service.\n\nNews was destined to become one of radio's strongest services in the early 1930s, but it still had its struggles. At first, radio announcers would just read newspaper headlines over the air, but gradually networks began purchasing news from wire services. In 1932 the Associated Press sold presidential election bulletins to the networks, and programs were interrupted with news flashes. Newspapers objected to this on the grounds that news on radio would diminish the sale of papers.\n\nStage one began very slowly, and the newspapers were not at all hostile toward broadcasting. In fact, they were helpful in promoting radio in the early 1920s. Initially, the stations were not seen as channels of news delivery, but as promotional devices for the newspapers that owned them. The prospect of wire service provision of news to radio upset some print journalists, and that led to the Associated Press issuing a notice to its members that AP news bulletins were not to be used for purposes of broadcasting. One event that led to conflict between the journalists was the 1924 Presidential Election.\n\nStage two, the entry of radio as a new medium was horrifying to the established news distribution source. Prior to radio news moved through wire services, through the newspapers to the people. The press started to fear that if radio started to provide news, then news could bypass the newspapers, thus shifting the flow of news throughout society. This started a fight for self-preservation on the part of newspapers, which could only be won if all journalists stood together. In April 1933 all three wire services agreed to stop providing radio with news bulletins. The anti-radio forces had finally gotten their wish. Broadcasters were now forced to find new ways of obtaining bulletins for their newscasts, and by the fall of 1933 CBS established a full news division, NBC followed on a smaller scale and the networks were more independent from print journalists for their news bulletins.\n\nStage three, print journalists had to find ways to prevent and limit the development of broadcasting. The \"attack\" on broadcasting took three forms, political lobbying, economic boycott, and legal action. At first it worked, only a few months after networks began broadcasting their own news, they appealed to the press to meet and negotiate a \"peace agreement\".\n\nA meeting of newspaper publishers, network executives, and wire service representatives, held at the Biltmore Hotel in New York City in 1933, it established The Biltmore Agreement. The meeting was called by CBS President William S. Paley with the purpose to end the long standing dispute as to news broadcasting. It stipulated that networks could air two five-minute newscasts a day, one in the morning after 9:30 A.M. and one in the evening after 9:00 p.m. so they would not compete with the primary hours of newspaper sales. No \"hot off the wire\" news was to be broadcast, and newscasts were not to have advertising support because this might detract from newspaper advertising. Newspaper publishers ensured that these provisions appeared in The Biltmore Agreement because they were the more powerful and wealthiest of the meeting participants.\n\nThe deal had barely been a few hours old when its intent began to be subverted. The newspaper publishers agreed to allow radio stations and networks to have commentators. Radio took advantage of this provision, and often these commentators became thinly disguised news reporters. NBC and CBS began their own news gathering activities. At NBC, one person gathered news simply by making telephone calls. Sometimes he scooped newspaper reporters because almost anyone would answer a call at NBC. In addition, he could reward news sources with highly prized tickets to NBC's top shows.\n\nIndependent broadcasters did not sign the agreement, leaving a big problem for the press, because only 150 of the 600 radio stations were network owned. Before long, news gathering agencies emerged to fill the vacancy of news sources. The most successful of these agencies was the Transradio Press Service, which had over 150 subscribers after only 9 months of operation. There was nothing the press could do and no legal justification for taking action against the agencies.\n\nBroadcast journalism did not develop until the mid 1930s. Relationships between the older print media and the newer medium of radio were not friendly, and the journalists of the time needed considerable diplomatic skills in dealing with the wire services and their own employers. By the beginning of the next decade the effectiveness and reliability of broadcast journalism was confirmed by the coverage of World War II.\n\n"}
{"id": "1671153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1671153", "title": "These Are the Voyages...", "text": "These Are the Voyages...\n\n\"These Are the Voyages...\" is the series finale of the American science fiction television series \"\". The 22nd episode of the and the 98th of the series overall, it first aired on the UPN network in the United States on May 13, 2005. \"These Are the Voyages...\" is a frame story, where the 22nd-century events of \"Star Trek: Enterprise\" are shown through a 24th-century holodeck re-creation during the \"\" episode \"\". The episode features guest stars Jonathan Frakes, Marina Sirtis, and Jeffrey Combs, as well as a voice cameo from Brent Spiner. Series creators Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, who co-wrote the episode, conceived \"These Are the Voyages...\" as a valentine to \"Star Trek\" fans.\n\nSet in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship \"Enterprise\", registration NX-01. In this episode, the story moves to the year 2370, when Commander William Riker grapples with making a difficult admission to his commanding officer about a cover-up. Riker, after consulting Counselor Troi, turns to the simulated events of the year 2161 for guidance, when the crew of \"Enterprise\" travels home to Earth for both decommissioning and the formation of the United Federation of Planets.\n\nReaction to \"These Are the Voyages...\" was negative. Critics and cast alike believed the \"Next Generation\" frame robbed the characters and their fans of closure, and that the death of Commander Tucker felt forced and unnecessary. The final episode attracted 3.8 million viewers, the highest number since the previous season. After a strong premiere, \"Enterprise\" had grappled with declining ratings throughout its run. By the fourth season, fewer than three million viewers tuned in each week despite what some fans and critics considered an increase in episode quality. After selling the syndication rights, UPN and Paramount announced in February 2005 that the fourth season would be the show's last. With no new \"Star Trek\" episodes in the fall of 2005, the 2005–2006 season was the first year without a first-run \"Star Trek\" in 18 years. Despite the cancellation, Paramount hoped to revive the series, and Berman began work on a possible new \"Star Trek\" film, which was ultimately rejected in favor of the J. J. Abrams-directed \"Star Trek\".\n\nIn 2370, Commander William Riker, aboard \"Enterprise\"-D, is troubled by the events of \"\" and seeks guidance. At Lieutenant Commander Deanna Troi's suggestion, Riker sets a holo-program to the date 2161, some six years after the events of \"Terra Prime\", to a time when the original \"Enterprise\" (NX-01) is due to be decommissioned after ten years of active service. The starship and its crew are also returning to Earth for the signing of the Federation Charter, and Captain Archer frets over the speech he will give to the assembled delegates.\n\nEn route, Riker and Troi observe as \"Enterprise\" is contacted by Shran, a former Andorian Imperial Guard who Archer believed was dead. Apparently his young daughter has been kidnapped, and he asks for Archer's help in rescuing her from Rigel X. Archer decides to assist, despite Commander T'Pol's warning that they may be late returning for the ceremony. Riker joins the \"Enterprise\" crew as it assaults Shran's enemies and brings his daughter safely back. Troi also advises that Riker assume the role of ship's chef, hoping to earn the confidence of the simulated crew. As he prepares food with the crew, he learns more about their memories and impressions of Tucker.\n\nHe also watches as the kidnappers board \"Enterprise\", and how, in order to save Archer's life, Commander Tucker overloads two conduits and dies after becoming mortally wounded. He notices that Archer is troubled that he must write a speech about how worthwhile their explorations have been, despite his friend's death, but T'Pol assures him that Tucker would have considered it worthwhile. On Earth, Troi watches as Archer enters a crowded grand hall to give his speech and Riker joins her, now sure of what course he should take. The final shot of the episode is a montage of the ships named \"Enterprise\" as Captains Picard, Kirk, and Archer recite the \"Where no man has gone before\" monologue.\n\n\"These Are the Voyages...\" was written by Braga and Berman, the pair's only script of the fourth season. \"Enterprise\" writer Mike Sussman told TrekNation in May 2005 that Braga had considered the idea of an episode crossover featuring characters from other \"Star Trek\" series prior to the finale. Sussman's original idea for the episode was to have of \"\" treating an ill patient who may or may not have been Archer trapped in the future. Due to the subject matter, Sussman said his version would not have been suitable for the final episode. In interviews, Berman said that the episode had always been intended as the season finale regardless of cancellation, and gave conflicting answers regarding whether Trip would still have been killed if the show was to continue.\n\nAllan Kroeker directed the episode, his third series finale following \"\"s \"What You Leave Behind\" and \"\"s \"\". \"These Are the Voyages...\" featured guest appearances by Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis as their \"Next Generation\" characters William Riker and Deanna Troi. Brent Spiner, another \"Next Generation\" veteran who had guest-starred earlier in the fourth season of \"Enterprise\", had an off-screen speaking role as the android Data. Jeffrey Combs appeared as the Andorian Shran, whom Coto had wanted to be a permanent addition to the cast in the event of another season.\n\nFilming of the final episode began on Friday, February 25, after the first half of the day was spent completing \"Terra Prime\". Principal photography took eight days to complete, one day longer than usual. The snowy complex set of Rigel X, first seen in the pilot episode, was used, as was the rarely seen \"Enterprise\"s galley. \"Enterprise\"-D locations such as hallways and the observation lounge were re-created. Frakes and Sirtis arrived at the lot at the same time that a \"Save Enterprise\" rally was being held outside the gates. Similar to \"What You Leave Behind\", many of the production staff cameoed for a large crowd scene at the end of the episode, as Archer prepares to give his speech. Fifteen \"VIPs\" including writers Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, André Bormanis, and Manny Coto joined two dozen extras in forming part of the audience. The rest of the digital set was filled by a computer-generated crowd. After their parts were finished, the final dismissal of each cast member was met with applause. Jolene Blalock and Scott Bakula were the last actors to be released, and Bakula gave a speech thanking the production crew for making the cast feel welcome. Filming ended on Tuesday, March 8, and the sets were struck. Frakes and Sirtis returned on March 9 to complete green screen shots, which would be used when their characters entered or exited the holodeck. Before the episode's release, Berman would not elaborate on the final episode's content, saying \"It's going to have some surprising twists and turns. It's somewhat of a valentine.\"\n\n\"These Are the Voyages...\" was negatively received by both critics and the show's cast. Before the episode aired, Blalock called the episode \"appalling.\" She followed up her remarks by saying she was upset over the finale being a \"The Next Generation\" episode rather than an end for \"Enterprise\".\nConnor Trinneer (who played Commander Trip Tucker), felt that the finale should have had a memorable farewell that he described as a \"\"M*A*S*H\" moment\", but that the producers did not want to focus on such an element. Anthony Montgomery (who played Ensign Travis Mayweather) was similarly displeased with the finale and said, \"I feel there could have been a more effective way to wrap things up for our show as well as the franchise as a whole. It just seemed to take a little bit away from what the \"Enterprise\" cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years.\" While Frakes enjoyed working with Sirtis again, he said that \"the reality is it was a bit of a stretch to have us shut down [the \"Enterprise\" cast's] show,\" and that in hindsight it was a disservice to them. The early criticism forced the show's producers to hold a conference and address the issue. Braga admitted there was cast unrest, but defended the episode as a way to close not just \"Enterprise\" but \"Star Trek\" as a whole.\n\nReviewers were also critical of the \"Next Generation\" tie-in. Sci Fi Weekly's Patrick Lee said the framing story \"reduces [the \"Enterprise\" cast] to the status of lab rats.\" Lee further noted that even without the guest appearances, the episode did not live up to the best offerings of the season, including \"In a Mirror, Darkly\". \"National Post\"s Alex Strachan called the \"Next Generation\" cameos reminders of better \"Star Trek\", compared to the \"bad make-up effects, bad acting, bad music\" of the latest show. Rob Salem of the \"Toronto Star\" said the cameos served no narrative purpose, and that the episode \"robs [the] characters (and their fans) of any significant long-term development or satisfying sense of closure.\" Reviewers also criticized the episode's ending, where viewers never got to see Archer's rousing speech. IGN said that the episode was \"Berman and Braga's parting shot, making sure that everyone knew who was in charge,\" and that the sharp contrast between \"These Are the Voyages...\" and \"Terra Prime\" brought into relief the reason why both should not be allowed to produce \"Star Trek\" ever again.\n\nThe death of Tucker was another object of controversy. Salem described the development as \"a major character is pointlessly killed off in service of a pointless plot device,\" a complaint echoed by IGN. Actor Connor Trinneer, who played Trip, said during a convention appearance that the character had \"gotten out of much worse scrapes than that,\" and the death seemed forced. The writers, Trinneer contended, wanted to kill off a character to \"get the fans talking,\" and so Trip was killed off simply to manipulate viewers. Several critics ended their reviews by saying that whether fans would be disappointed or pleased by the episode, the majority of casual viewers would not care one way or another.\n\nIn response to some of these criticisms, Coto stated that he personally considered the two-part story \"\" and \"Terra Prime\" that preceded \"These Are the Voyages...\" the actual finale of the \"Enterprise\" storyline. Berman said \"I've read a lot of the criticisms and I understand how some people feel, but [Braga] and I spent a lot of time coming up with the idea and a somewhat, I would say, unique ending to a series, especially when you’re ending it prematurely. [...] You never like to disappoint people, but I think it's nonsense to say that it was more a \"Next Generation\" episode than an \"Enterprise\" episode. The only elements of [\"The Next Generation\"] that were present were there as a sounding board to allow us to look at a mission that took place six years after \"Terra Prime\".\"\n\nThe episode was released on DVD home media as part of the season four box set on November 1, 2005 in the United States. The Blu ray release of the final season of \"Enterprise\" was made available on April 29, 2014.\n\n\"\", \"Enterprise\"s 2001 premiere episode, attracted 12.5 million viewers in its first broadcast, but ratings quickly dropped to a low of 5.9 million viewers. \"Enterprise\" was threatened with cancellation by the third season. The show survived by slashing its budget amid broadcaster UPN's schedule revamp. The show was moved to Fridays in 2004, while the rest of UPN's programming became more female-friendly, in part due to the success of \"America's Next Top Model\". The third season introduced a season-long story arc, to some of the best reviews of the entire series. In the fourth season, Manny Coto became executive producer after writing and co-producing the show since 2003. While Coto's episodes were hailed by critics and fans as equaling the quality of previous \"Star Trek\" television series, the average viewership dropped to 2.9 million, with a series-low showing of 2.5 million in January 2005. According to TrekNation, \"Enterprise\"s final episode attracted 3.8 million viewers, an increase of 69% over the previous season's finale.\n\nOn February 3, 2005, UPN and Paramount announced that the fourth season of the show would be its last. The network waited until the series had been sold to syndication before making the announcement. The cancellation marked the first time new \"Star Trek\" episodes would not appear on television in 18 years, since \"\" premiered. The fourth season continued production so that Paramount could sell an attractive 98 episodes to syndicates.\n\nA series-ending wrap party was held for the cast and crew at the Roosevelt Hotel in April. Cast members spoke about their feelings about the end of the series. John Billingsley said the show \"was a great ride, and it changed my life. It's something that will last forever for me.\" He was happy to say goodbye to the two-hour makeup sessions to create his character, Phlox. Many of the cast were taking a break and going on vacation before seeking new acting jobs. Among the notable guests were \"\" screenwriter John Logan, who was not affiliated with \"Enterprise\", and Peter Weller, who appeared as a villain in \"Terra Prime\".\n\nActress Jolene Blalock (T'Pol) criticized the early stories as boring and lacking intriguing content. She felt that early \"Enterprise\" scripts ignored basic tenets of \"Star Trek\" chronology, and offered \"revealing costumes instead of character development\". UPN executives stated that the male-oriented episodes of \"Enterprise\" did not mesh with the viewership of its other top shows, such as \"Top Model\" and \"Veronica Mars\". Brannon Braga suggested that the reason for the cancellation was viewer fatigue, noting that \"after 18 years and 624 hours of \"Star Trek\", the audience began to have a little bit of overkill.\" Fans, meanwhile, criticized Berman and Braga for ignoring \"Star Trek\" canon and refusing to fix their shows. Michael Hinman, news coordinator for SyFy Portal, stated that in addition to the oversaturation of \"Star Trek\", there \"also is an oversaturation of Braga and Berman. [...] They couldn't sit back and say, 'You know, we just can't keep this fresh.' No, it was more about their stupid egos, and their nonsensical 'Even if it's broke, don't fix it' attitude.\" Braga defended the series, noting that \"The Next Generation\" faced little competition from other science fiction shows, while \"Enterprise\" had to contend with a plethora of shows such as \"Battlestar Galactica\".\n\nNewspapers covering \"Enterprise\"s cancellation and its final episode often said that the failure of \"Enterprise\" was evidence that the franchise had moved too far from its roots and grown too dark. Andy Dehnhart of MSNBC said that \"while the writers and production designers deserve credit for offering worlds that were perhaps slightly more believable, they lost the fantastic, wondrous approach to space travel that \"The Next Generation\" borrowed from the original \"Star Trek\" and then perfected.\" \"USA Today\"s Michael Peck said that without the \"dreams\" of earlier series, \"\"Star Trek\" becomes just another television drama.\" Melanie McFarland of the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\", meanwhile, said the show \"never found the sense of uniqueness within the \"Trek\" universe that every version that came before it possessed.\" Despite the cancellation, Paramount remained optimistic. Studio head David Stapf looked \"forward to a new chapter of this enduring franchise in the future.\" Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendrensen developed a concept for a new film taking place after \"Enterprise\" but before the 1960s television show. Meanwhile, Paramount asked Roberto Orci for ideas to revive the franchise, resulting in the production of a reboot film set in an alternate timeline from the 1966–2005 franchise simply titled \"Star Trek\", released in May 2009 and directed by J. J. Abrams.\n"}
{"id": "148224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148224", "title": "Thomas Beecham", "text": "Thomas Beecham\n\nSir Thomas Beecham, 2nd Baronet, CH</small> (29 April 18798 March 1961) was an English conductor and impresario best known for his association with the London Philharmonic and the Royal Philharmonic orchestras. He was also closely associated with the Liverpool Philharmonic and Hallé orchestras. From the early 20th century until his death, Beecham was a major influence on the musical life of Britain and, according to the BBC, was Britain's first international conductor.\n\nBorn to a rich industrial family, Beecham began his career as a conductor in 1899. He used his access to the family fortune to finance opera from the 1910s until the start of the Second World War, staging seasons at Covent Garden, Drury Lane and His Majesty's Theatre with international stars, his own orchestra and a wide repertoire. Among the works he introduced to England were Richard Strauss's \"Elektra\", \"Salome\" and \"Der Rosenkavalier\" and three operas by Frederick Delius.\n\nTogether with his younger colleague Malcolm Sargent, Beecham founded the London Philharmonic, and he conducted its first performance at the Queen's Hall in 1932. In the 1940s he worked for three years in the United States where he was music director of the Seattle Symphony and conducted at the Metropolitan Opera. After his return to Britain, he founded the Royal Philharmonic in 1946 and conducted it until his death in 1961.\n\nBeecham's repertoire was eclectic, sometimes favouring lesser-known composers over famous ones. His specialities included composers whose works were neglected in Britain before he became their advocate, such as Delius and Berlioz. Other composers with whose music he was frequently associated were Haydn, Schubert, Sibelius and the composer he revered above all others, Mozart.\n\nBeecham was born in St Helens, Lancashire, in a house adjoining the Beecham's Pills laxative factory founded by his grandfather, Thomas Beecham. His parents were Joseph Beecham, the elder son of Thomas, and Josephine, \"née\" Burnett. He was an uncle of poet Audrey Beecham. In 1885, with the family firm flourishing financially, Joseph Beecham moved his family to a large house in Ewanville, Huyton, near Liverpool. Their former home was demolished to make room for an extension to the pill factory.\n\nBeecham was educated at Rossall School between 1892 and 1897, after which he hoped to attend a music conservatoire in Germany, but his father forbade it, and instead Beecham went to Wadham College, Oxford, to read Classics. He did not find university life to his taste and successfully sought his father's permission to leave Oxford in 1898. He studied as a pianist, but had difficulty because of his small hands, and any career as a soloist was ruled out by a wrist injury in 1904. He studied composition privately with Frederic Austin in Liverpool, Charles Wood in London, and Moritz Moszkowski in Paris. As a conductor, he was self-taught.\n\nBeecham first conducted in public in St Helens in October 1899, with an \"ad hoc\" ensemble comprising local musicians and players from the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the Hallé in Manchester. A month later, he stood in at short notice for the celebrated conductor Hans Richter at a concert by the Hallé to mark Joseph Beecham's inauguration as mayor of St Helens. Soon afterwards, Joseph Beecham secretly committed his wife to a mental hospital. Thomas and his elder sister Emily helped to secure their mother's release and to force their father to pay annual alimony of £4,500. For this, Joseph disinherited them. Beecham was estranged from his father for ten years.\n\nBeecham's professional début as a conductor was in 1902 at the Shakespeare Theatre, Clapham, with Balfe's \"The Bohemian Girl\", for the Imperial Grand Opera Company. He was engaged as assistant conductor for a tour and was allotted four other operas, including \"Carmen\" and \"Pagliacci\". A Beecham biographer calls the company \"grandly named but decidedly ramshackle\", though Beecham's Carmen was Zélie de Lussan, a leading exponent of the title role. Beecham was also composing music in these early years, but he was not satisfied with his own efforts and instead concentrated on conducting.\n\nIn 1906 Beecham was invited to conduct the New Symphony Orchestra, a recently formed ensemble of 46 players, in a series of concerts at the Bechstein Hall in London. Throughout his career, Beecham frequently chose to programme works to suit his own tastes rather than those of the paying public. In his early discussions with his new orchestra, he proposed works by a long list of barely known composers such as Étienne Méhul, Nicolas Dalayrac and Ferdinando Paer. During this period, Beecham first encountered the music of Frederick Delius, which he at once loved deeply and with which he became closely associated for the rest of his life.\n\nBeecham quickly concluded that to compete with the two existing London orchestras, the Queen's Hall Orchestra and the recently founded London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), his forces must be expanded to full symphonic strength and play in larger halls. For two years starting in October 1907, Beecham and the enlarged New Symphony Orchestra gave concerts at the Queen's Hall. He paid little attention to the box office: his programmes were described by a biographer as \"even more certain to deter the public then than it would be in our own day\". The principal pieces of his first concert with the orchestra were d'Indy's symphonic ballad \"La forêt enchantée\", Smetana's symphonic poem \"Šárka\", and Lalo's little-known Symphony in G minor. Beecham retained an affection for the last work: it was among the works he conducted at his final recording sessions more than fifty years later.\n\nIn 1908 Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra parted company, disagreeing about artistic control and, in particular, the deputy system. Under this system, orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement elsewhere, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: \"\"A\", whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends \"B\" (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. \"B\", without your knowledge or consent, sends \"C\" to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, \"C\" sends \"D\", whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away.\" Henry Wood had already banned the deputy system in the Queen's Hall Orchestra (provoking rebel players to found the London Symphony Orchestra), and Beecham followed suit. The New Symphony Orchestra survived without him and subsequently became the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra.\n\nIn 1909, Beecham founded the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. He did not poach from established symphony orchestras, but instead he recruited from theatre bandrooms, local symphony societies, the palm courts of hotels, and music colleges. The result was a youthful team – the typical age of his players was 25. They included names that would become celebrated in their fields, such as Albert Sammons, Lionel Tertis, Eric Coates and Eugene Cruft.\n\nBecause he persistently programmed works that did not attract the public, Beecham's musical activities at this time consistently lost money. As a result of his estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune was strictly limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of £700 left to him in his grandfather's will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts, but it was not until father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able to draw on the family fortune to promote opera.\n\nFrom 1910, subsidised by his father, Beecham realised his ambition to mount opera seasons at Covent Garden and other houses. In the Edwardian opera house, the star singers were regarded as all-important, and conductors were seen as ancillary. Between 1910 and 1939 Beecham did much to change the balance of power.\nIn 1910, Beecham either conducted or was responsible as impresario for 190 performances at Covent Garden and His Majesty's Theatre. His assistant conductors were Bruno Walter and Percy Pitt. During the year, he mounted 34 different operas, most of them either new to London or almost unknown there. Beecham later acknowledged that in his early years the operas he chose to present were too obscure to attract the public. During his 1910 season at His Majesty's, the rival Grand Opera Syndicate put on a concurrent season of its own at Covent Garden; London's total opera performances for the year amounted to 273 performances, far more than the box-office demand could support. Of the 34 operas that Beecham staged in 1910, only four made money: Richard Strauss's new operas \"Elektra\" and \"Salome,\" receiving their first, and highly publicised, performances in Britain, and \"The Tales of Hoffmann\" and \"Die Fledermaus\".\n\nIn 1911 and 1912, the Beecham Symphony Orchestra played for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, both at Covent Garden and at the Krolloper in Berlin, under the batons of Beecham and Pierre Monteux, Diaghilev's chief conductor. Beecham was much admired for conducting the complicated new score of Stravinsky's \"Petrushka\", at two days' notice and without rehearsal, when Monteux became unavailable. While in Berlin, Beecham and his orchestra, in Beecham's words, caused a \"mild stir\", scoring a triumph: the orchestra was agreed by the Berlin press to be an elite body, one of the best in the world. The principal Berlin musical weekly, \"Die Signale\", asked, \"Where does London find such magnificent young instrumentalists?\" The violins were credited with rich, noble tone, the woodwinds with lustre, the brass, \"which has not quite the dignity and amplitude of our best German brass\", with uncommon delicacy of execution.\nBeecham's 1913 seasons included the British premiere of Strauss's \"Der Rosenkavalier\" at Covent Garden, and a \"Grand Season of Russian Opera and Ballet\" at Drury Lane. At the latter there were three operas, all starring Feodor Chaliapin, and all new to Britain: Mussorgsky's \"Boris Godunov\" and \"Khovanshchina\", and Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Ivan the Terrible\". There were also 15 ballets, with leading dancers including Vaslav Nijinsky and Tamara Karsavina. The ballets included Debussy's \"Jeux\" and his controversially erotic \"L'après-midi d'un faune,\" and the British premiere of Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring,\" six weeks after its first performance in Paris. Beecham shared Monteux's private dislike of the piece, much preferring \"Petrushka\". Beecham did not conduct during this season; Monteux and others conducted the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. The following year, Beecham and his father presented Rimsky-Korsakov's \"The Maid of Pskov\" and Borodin's \"Prince Igor\", with Chaliapin, and Stravinsky's \"The Nightingale.\"\n\nDuring the First World War, Beecham strove, often without a fee, to keep music alive in London, Liverpool, Manchester and other British cities. He conducted for, and gave financial support to, three institutions with which he was connected at various times: the Hallé Orchestra, the LSO and the Royal Philharmonic Society. In 1915 he formed the Beecham Opera Company, with mainly British singers, performing in London and throughout the country. In 1916, he received a knighthood in the New Year Honours and succeeded to the baronetcy on his father's death later that year.\n\nAfter the war, there were joint Covent Garden seasons with the Grand Opera Syndicate in 1919 and 1920, but these were, according to a biographer, pale confused echoes of the years before 1914. These seasons included forty productions, of which Beecham conducted only nine. After the 1920 season, Beecham temporarily withdrew from conducting to deal with a financial problem that he described as \"the most trying and unpleasant experience of my life\".\n\nInfluenced by an ambitious financier, James White, Sir Joseph Beecham had agreed, in July 1914, to buy the Covent Garden estate from the Duke of Bedford and float a limited company to manage the estate commercially. The deal was described by \"The Times\" as \"one of the largest ever carried out in real estate in London\". Sir Joseph paid an initial deposit of £200,000 and covenanted to pay the balance of the £2 million purchase price on 11 November. Within a month, however, the First World War broke out, and new official restrictions on the use of capital prevented the completion of the contract. The estate and market continued to be managed by the Duke's staff, and in October 1916, Joseph Beecham died suddenly, with the transaction still uncompleted. The matter was brought before the civil courts with the aim of disentangling Sir Joseph's affairs; the court and all parties agreed that a private company should be formed, with his two sons as directors, to complete the Covent Garden contract. In July 1918, the Duke and his trustees conveyed the estate to the new company, subject to a mortgage of the balance of the purchase price still outstanding: £1.25 million.\n\nBeecham and his brother Henry had to sell enough of their father's estate to discharge this mortgage. For more than three years, Beecham was absent from the musical scene, working to sell property worth over £1 million. By 1923 enough money had been raised. The mortgage was discharged, and Beecham's personal liabilities, amounting to £41,558, were paid in full. In 1924 the Covent Garden property and the pill-making business at St Helens were united in one company, Beecham Estates and Pills. The nominal capital was £1,850,000, of which Beecham had a substantial share.\n\nAfter his absence, Beecham first reappeared on the rostrum conducting the Hallé in Manchester in March 1923, in a programme including works by Berlioz, Bizet, Delius and Mozart. He returned to London the following month, conducting the combined Royal Albert Hall Orchestra (the renamed New Symphony Orchestra) and London Symphony Orchestra in April 1923. The main work on the programme was Richard Strauss's \"Ein Heldenleben\". No longer with an orchestra of his own, Beecham established a relationship with the London Symphony Orchestra that lasted for the rest of the 1920s. Towards the end of the decade, he negotiated inconclusively with the BBC over the possibility of establishing a permanent radio orchestra.\n\nIn 1931, Beecham was approached by the rising young conductor Malcolm Sargent with a proposal to set up a permanent, salaried orchestra with a subsidy guaranteed by Sargent's patrons, the Courtauld family. Originally Sargent and Beecham envisaged a reshuffled version of the London Symphony Orchestra, but the LSO, a self-governing co-operative, balked at weeding out and replacing underperforming players. In 1932 Beecham lost patience and agreed with Sargent to set up a new orchestra from scratch. The London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), as it was named, consisted of 106 players including a few young musicians straight from music college, many established players from provincial orchestras, and 17 of the LSO's leading members. The principals included Paul Beard, George Stratton, Anthony Pini, Gerald Jackson, Léon Goossens, Reginald Kell, James Bradshaw and Marie Goossens.\nThe orchestra made its debut at the Queen's Hall on 7 October 1932, conducted by Beecham. After the first item, Berlioz's \"Roman Carnival Overture\", the audience went wild, some of them standing on their seats to clap and shout. During the next eight years, the LPO appeared nearly a hundred times at the Queen's Hall for the Royal Philharmonic Society alone, played for Beecham's opera seasons at Covent Garden, and made more than 300 gramophone records. Berta Geissmar, his secretary from 1936, wrote, \"The relations between the Orchestra and Sir Thomas were always easy and cordial. He always treated a rehearsal as a joint undertaking with the Orchestra.… The musicians were entirely unselfconscious with him. Instinctively they accorded him the artistic authority which he did not expressly claim. Thus he obtained the best from them and they gave it without reserve.\"\n\nBy the early 1930s, Beecham had secured substantial control of the Covent Garden opera seasons. Wishing to concentrate on music-making rather than management, he assumed the role of artistic director, and Geoffrey Toye was recruited as managing director. In 1933, \"Tristan und Isolde\" with Frida Leider and Lauritz Melchior was a success, and the season continued with the \"Ring\" cycle and nine other operas. The 1934 season featured Conchita Supervía in \"La Cenerentola,\" and Lotte Lehmann and Alexander Kipnis in the \"Ring\". Clemens Krauss conducted the British première of Strauss's \"Arabella\". During 1933 and 1934, Beecham repelled attempts by John Christie to form a link between Christie's new Glyndebourne Festival and the Royal Opera House. Beecham and Toye fell out over the latter's insistence on bringing in a popular film star, Grace Moore, to sing Mimi in \"La bohème\". The production was a box-office success, but an artistic failure. Beecham manoeuvred Toye out of the managing directorship in what their fellow conductor Sir Adrian Boult described as an \"absolutely beastly\" manner.\n\nFrom 1935 to 1939, Beecham, now in sole control, presented international seasons with eminent guest singers and conductors. Beecham conducted between a third and half of the performances each season. He intended the 1940 season to include the first complete performances of Berlioz's \"Les Troyens\", but the outbreak of the Second World War caused the season to be abandoned. Beecham did not conduct again at Covent Garden until 1951, and by then it was no longer under his control.\n\nBeecham took the London Philharmonic on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936. There were complaints that he was being used by Nazi propagandists, and Beecham complied with a Nazi request not to play the \"Scottish\" Symphony of Mendelssohn, who was a Christian by faith but a Jew by birth. In Berlin, Beecham's concert was attended by Adolf Hitler, whose lack of punctuality caused Beecham to remark very audibly, \"The old bugger's late.\" After this tour, Beecham refused renewed invitations to give concerts in Germany, although he honoured contractual commitments to conduct at the Berlin State Opera, in 1937 and 1938, and recorded \"The Magic Flute\" for EMI in the Beethovensaal in Berlin in the same years.\n\nAs his sixtieth birthday approached, Beecham was advised by his doctors to take a year's complete break from music, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate. The Australian Broadcasting Commission had been seeking for several years to get him to conduct in Australia. The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, striving instead to secure the future of the London Philharmonic, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. Before leaving, Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra and helped its members to form themselves into a self-governing company.\n\nBeecham left Britain in the spring of 1940, going first to Australia and then to North America. He became music director of the Seattle Symphony in 1941. In 1942 he joined the Metropolitan Opera as joint senior conductor with his former assistant Bruno Walter. He began with his own adaptation of Bach's comic cantata, \"Phoebus and Pan\", followed by \"Le Coq d'Or\". His main repertoire was French: \"Carmen, Louise\" (with Grace Moore), \"Manon\", \"Faust\", \"Mignon\" and \"The Tales of Hoffmann\". In addition to his Seattle and New York posts, Beecham was guest conductor with 18 American orchestras.\n\nIn 1944, Beecham returned to Britain. Musically his reunion with the London Philharmonic was triumphant, but the orchestra, now (after his help in 1939) a self-governing co-operative, attempted to hire him on its own terms as its salaried artistic director. \"I emphatically refuse\", concluded Beecham, \"to be wagged by any orchestra ... I am going to found one more great orchestra to round off my career.\" When Walter Legge founded the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1945, Beecham conducted its first concert. But he was not disposed to accept a salaried position from Legge, his former assistant, any more than from his former players in the LPO.\n\nIn 1946, Beecham founded the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO), securing an agreement with the Royal Philharmonic Society that the new orchestra should replace the LPO at all the Society's concerts. Beecham later agreed with the Glyndebourne Festival that the RPO should be the resident orchestra at Glyndebourne each summer. He secured backing, including that of record companies in the US as well as Britain, with whom lucrative recording contracts were negotiated. As in 1909 and in 1932, Beecham's assistants recruited in the freelance pool and elsewhere. Original members of the RPO included James Bradshaw, Dennis Brain, Leonard Brain, Archie Camden, Gerald Jackson and Reginald Kell. The orchestra later became celebrated for its regular team of woodwind principals, often referred to as \"The Royal Family\", consisting of Jack Brymer (clarinet), Gwydion Brooke (bassoon), Terence MacDonagh (oboe) and Gerald Jackson (flute).\n\nBeecham's long association with the Hallé Orchestra as a guest conductor ceased after John Barbirolli became the orchestra's chief conductor in 1944. Beecham was, to his great indignation, ousted from the honorary presidency of the Hallé Concerts Society, and Barbirolli refused to \"let that man near my orchestra\". Beecham's relationship with the Liverpool Philharmonic, which he had first conducted in 1911, was resumed harmoniously after the war. A manager of the orchestra recalled, \"It was an unwritten law in Liverpool that first choice of dates offered to guest conductors was given to Beecham. ... In Liverpool there was one over-riding factor – he was adored.\"\n\nBeecham, whom the BBC called \"Britain's first international conductor\", took the RPO on a strenuous tour through the United States, Canada and South Africa in 1950. During the North American tour, Beecham conducted 49 concerts in almost daily succession. In 1951, he was invited to conduct at Covent Garden after a 12-year absence. State-funded for the first time, the opera company operated quite differently from his pre-war regime. Instead of short, star-studded seasons, with a major symphony orchestra, the new director David Webster was attempting to build up a permanent ensemble of home-grown talent performing all the year round, in English translations. Extreme economy in productions and great attention to the box-office were essential, and Beecham, though he had been hurt and furious at his exclusion, was not suited to participate in such an undertaking. When offered a chorus of eighty singers for his return, conducting \"Die Meistersinger\", he insisted on augmenting their number to 200. He also, contrary to Webster's policy, insisted on performing the piece in German. In 1953 at Oxford, Beecham presented the world premiere of Delius's first opera, \"Irmelin,\" and his last operatic performances in Britain were in 1955 at Bath, with Grétry's \"Zémire et Azor\".\n\nBetween 1951 and 1960, Beecham conducted 92 concerts at the Royal Festival Hall. Characteristic Beecham programmes of the RPO years included symphonies by Bizet, Franck, Haydn, Schubert and Tchaikovsky; Richard Strauss's \"Ein Heldenleben\"; concertos by Mozart and Saint-Saëns; a Delius and Sibelius programme; and many of his favoured shorter pieces. He did not stick uncompromisingly to his familiar repertoire. After the sudden death of the German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, Beecham in tribute conducted the two programmes his colleague had been due to present at the Festival Hall; these included Bach's Third Brandenburg Concerto, Ravel's \"Rapsodie espagnole\", Brahms's Symphony No. 1, and Barber's \"Second Essay for Orchestra\".\nIn the summer of 1958, Beecham conducted a season at the Teatro Colón, Buenos Aires, Argentina, consisting of Verdi's \"Otello,\" Bizet's \"Carmen\", Beethoven's \"Fidelio,\" Saint-Saëns's \"Samson and Delilah\" and Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\". These were his last operatic performances. It was during this season that Betty Humby died suddenly. She was cremated in Buenos Aires and her ashes returned to England. Beecham's own last illness prevented his operatic debut at Glyndebourne in a planned \"Magic Flute\" and a final appearance at Covent Garden conducting Berlioz's \"The Trojans\".\n\nSixty-six years after his first visit to America, Beecham made his last, beginning in late 1959, conducting in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and Washington. During this tour, he also conducted in Canada. He flew back to London on 12 April 1960 and did not leave England again. His final concert was at Portsmouth Guildhall on 7 May 1960. The programme, all characteristic choices, comprised the \"Magic Flute\" Overture, Haydn's Symphony No. 100 (the \"Military\"), Beecham's own Handel arrangement, \"Love in Bath\", Schubert's Symphony No. 5, \"On the River\" by Delius, and the \"Bacchanale\" from \"Samson and Delilah\".\n\nBeecham died of a coronary thrombosis at his London flat, aged 81, on 8 March 1961. He was buried two days later in Brookwood Cemetery, Surrey. Owing to changes at Brookwood, his remains were exhumed in 1991 and reburied in St Peter's Churchyard at Limpsfield, Surrey, close to the joint grave of Delius and his wife Jelka Rosen.\n\nBeecham was married three times. In 1903 he married Utica Celestina Welles, daughter of Dr Charles S. Welles, of New York, and his wife Ella Celeste, \"née\" Miles. Beecham and his wife had two sons: Adrian, born in 1904, who became a composer and achieved some celebrity in the 1920s and 1930s, and Thomas, born in 1909. After the birth of his second child, Beecham began to drift away from the marriage. By 1911, no longer living with his wife and family, he was involved as co-respondent in a much-publicised divorce case. Utica ignored advice that she should divorce him and secure substantial alimony; she did not believe in divorce. She never remarried after Beecham divorced her (in 1943), and she outlived her former husband by sixteen years, dying in 1977.\n\nIn 1909 or early 1910, Beecham began an affair with Maud Alice (known as Emerald), Lady Cunard. Although they never lived together, it continued, despite other relationships on his part, until his remarriage in 1943. She was a tireless fund-raiser for his musical enterprises. Beecham's biographers are agreed that she was in love with him, but that his feelings for her were less strong. During the 1920s and 1930s, Beecham also had an affair with Dora Labbette, a soprano sometimes known as Lisa Perli, with whom he had a son, Paul Strang, born in March 1933.\n\nIn 1943 Lady Cunard was devastated to learn (not from Beecham) that he intended to divorce Utica to marry Betty Humby, a concert pianist 29 years his junior. Beecham married Betty in 1943, and they were a devoted couple until her death in 1958. On 10 August 1959, two years before his death, he married in Zurich his former secretary, Shirley Hudson, who had worked for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra's administration since 1950. She was 27, he 80.\n\nThe earliest composer whose music Beecham regularly performed was Handel, whom he called, \"the great international master of all time. ... He wrote Italian music better than any Italian; French music better than any Frenchman; English music better than any Englishman; and, with the exception of Bach, outrivalled all other Germans.\" In his performances of Handel, Beecham ignored what he called the \"professors, pedants, pedagogues\". He followed Mendelssohn and Mozart in editing and reorchestrating Handel's scores to suit contemporary tastes. At a time when Handel's operas were scarcely known, Beecham knew them so well that he was able to arrange three ballets, two other suites and a piano concerto from them. He gave Handel's oratorio \"Solomon\" its first performance since the 18th century, with a text edited by the conductor.\n\nWith Haydn, too, Beecham was far from an authenticist, using unscholarly 19th-century versions of the scores, avoiding the use of the harpsichord, and phrasing the music romantically. He recorded the twelve \"London\" symphonies, and regularly programmed some of them in his concerts. Earlier Haydn works were unfamiliar in the first half of the 20th century, but Beecham conducted several of them, including the Symphony No. 40 and an early piano concerto. He programmed \"The Seasons\" regularly throughout his career, recording it for EMI in 1956, and in 1944 added \"The Creation\" to his repertoire.\n\nFor Beecham, Mozart was \"the central point of European music,\" and he treated the composer's scores with more deference than he gave most others. He edited the incomplete Requiem, made English translations of at least two of the great operas, and introduced Covent Garden audiences who had rarely if ever heard them to \"Così fan tutte\", \"Der Schauspieldirektor\" and \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\"; he also regularly programmed \"The Magic Flute\", \"Don Giovanni\" and \"The Marriage of Figaro\". He considered the best of Mozart's piano concertos to be \"the most beautiful compositions of their kind in the world\", and he played them many times with Betty Humby-Beecham and others.\n\nBeecham's attitude towards 19th-century German repertoire was equivocal. He frequently disparaged Beethoven, Wagner and others, but regularly conducted their works, often with great success. He observed, \"Wagner, though a tremendous genius, gorged music like a German who overeats. And Bruckner was a hobbledehoy who had no style at all ... Even Beethoven thumped the tub; the Ninth symphony was composed by a kind of Mr. Gladstone of music.\" Despite his criticisms, Beecham conducted all the Beethoven symphonies during his career, and he made studio recordings of Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8, and live recordings of No. 9 and \"Missa Solemnis\". He conducted the Fourth Piano Concerto with pleasure (recording it with Arthur Rubinstein and the LPO) but avoided the \"Emperor Concerto\" when possible.\n\nBeecham was not known for his Bach but nonetheless chose Bach (arranged by Beecham) for his debut at the Metropolitan Opera. He later gave the Third Brandenburg Concerto in one of his memorial concerts for Wilhelm Furtwängler (a performance described by \"The Times\" as \"a travesty, albeit an invigorating one\"). In Brahms's music, Beecham was selective. He made a speciality of the Second Symphony but conducted the Third only occasionally, the First rarely, and the Fourth never. He sometimes conducted the German Requiem, but judged it \"a \"dull\" piece\"; his 1956 recording of an English-language Schicksalslied (a work sometimes termed a \"Little Requiem\") has been described as \"a deeply-felt and eloquently expressed performance...[Beecham] gets to the heart of Brahms's serious Germanic inspiration in such revelatory fashion.\" In his memoirs he made no mention of any Brahms performance after the year 1909.\n\nBeecham was a great Wagnerian, despite his frequent expostulation about the composer's length and repetitiousness: \"We've been rehearsing for two hours – and we're still playing the same bloody tune!\" Beecham conducted all the works in the regular Wagner canon with the exception of \"Parsifal\", which he presented at Covent Garden but never with himself in the pit. The chief music critic of \"The Times\" observed: \"Beecham's \"Lohengrin\" was almost Italian in its lyricism; his \"Ring\" was less heroic than Bruno Walter's or Furtwängler's, but it sang from beginning to end\".\n\nRichard Strauss had a lifelong champion in Beecham, who introduced \"Elektra\", \"Salome\", \"Der Rosenkavalier\" and other operas to England. Beecham programmed \"Ein Heldenleben\" from 1910 until his last year; his final recording of it was released shortly after his death. \"Don Quixote, Till Eulenspiegel\", the \"Bourgeois Gentilhomme\" music and \"Don Juan\" also featured in his repertory, but not \"Also Sprach Zarathustra\" or \"Tod und Verklärung\". Strauss had the first and last pages of the manuscript of \"Elektra\" framed and presented them to \"my highly honoured friend ... and distinguished conductor of my work.\"\n\nIn the opinion of the jury of the Académie du Disque Français, \"Sir Thomas Beecham has done more for French music abroad than any French conductor\". Berlioz featured prominently in Beecham's repertoire throughout his career, and in an age when the composer's works received little exposure, Beecham presented most of them and recorded many. Along with Sir Colin Davis, Beecham has been described as one of the two \"foremost modern interpreters\" of Berlioz's music. Both in concert and the recording studio, Beecham's choices of French music were characteristically eclectic. He avoided Ravel but regularly programmed Debussy. Fauré did not feature often, although his orchestral \"Pavane\" was an exception; Beecham's final recording sessions in 1959 included the \"Pavane\" and the \"Dolly Suite\". Bizet was among Beecham's favourites, and other French composers favoured by him included Gustave Charpentier, Delibes, Duparc, Grétry, Lalo, Lully, Offenbach, Saint-Saëns and Ambroise Thomas. Many of Beecham's later recordings of French music were made in Paris with the Orchestre National de la Radiodiffusion Française. \"C'est un dieu\", their concertmaster said of Beecham in 1957.\n\nOf the more than two dozen operas in the Verdi canon, Beecham conducted eight during his long career: \"Il trovatore\", \"La traviata\", \"Aida\", \"Don Carlos\", \"Rigoletto\", \"Un ballo in maschera\", \"Otello\" and \"Falstaff\". As early as 1904, Beecham met Puccini through the librettist Luigi Illica, who had written the libretto for Beecham's youthful attempt at composing an Italian opera. At the time of their meeting, Puccini and Illica were revising \"Madama Butterfly\" after its disastrous première. Beecham rarely conducted that work, but he conducted \"Tosca\", \"Turandot\" and \"La bohème\". His 1956 recording of \"La bohème\", with Victoria de los Ángeles and Jussi Björling, has seldom been out of the catalogues since its release and received more votes than any other operatic set in a 1967 symposium of prominent critics.\n\nExcept for Delius, Beecham was generally antipathetic to, or at best lukewarm about, the music of his native land and its leading composers. Beecham's championship of Delius, however, promoted the composer from relative obscurity. Delius's amanuensis, Eric Fenby, referred to Beecham as \"excelling all others in the music of Delius ... Groves and Sargent may have matched him in the great choruses of \"A Mass of Life\", but in all else Beecham was matchless, especially with the orchestra.\" In an all-Delius concert in June 1911 Beecham conducted the premiere of \"Songs of Sunset\". He put on Delius Festivals in 1929 and 1946 and presented his concert works throughout his career. He conducted the British premieres of the operas \"A Village Romeo and Juliet\" in 1910 and \"Koanga\" in 1935, and the world premiere of \"Irmelin\" in 1953. However, he was not an uncritical Delian: he never conducted the \"Requiem\", and he detailed his criticisms of it in his book on Delius.\n\nAnother major 20th-century composer who engaged Beecham's sympathies was Sibelius, who recognised him as a fine conductor of his music (although Sibelius tended to be lavish with praise of anybody who conducted his music). In a live recording of a December 1954 concert performance of Sibelius's Second Symphony with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the Festival Hall, Beecham can be heard uttering encouraging shouts at the orchestra at climactic moments.\n\nBeecham was dismissive of some of the established classics, saying for example, \"I would give the whole of Bach's \"Brandenburg Concertos\" for Massenet's \"Manon\", and would think I had vastly profited by the exchange\". He was, by contrast, famous for presenting slight pieces as encores, which he called \"lollipops\". Some of the best-known were Berlioz's \"Danse des sylphes\"; Chabrier's \"Joyeuse Marche\" and Gounod's \"Le Sommeil de Juliette\".\n\nThe composer Richard Arnell wrote that Beecham preferred making records to giving concerts: \"He told me that audiences got in the way of music-making – he was apt to catch someone's eye in the front row.\" The conductor and critic Trevor Harvey wrote in \"The Gramophone\", however, that studio recordings could never recapture the thrill of Beecham performing live in the concert hall.\nBeecham began making recordings in 1910, when the acoustical process obliged orchestras to use only principal instruments, placed as close to the recording horn as possible. His first recordings, for HMV, were of excerpts from Offenbach's \"The Tales of Hoffmann\" and Johann Strauss's \"Die Fledermaus\". In 1915, Beecham began recording for the Columbia Graphophone Company. Electrical recording technology (introduced in 1925–26) made it possible to record a full orchestra with much greater frequency range, and Beecham quickly embraced the new medium. Longer scores had to be broken into four-minute segments to fit on 12-inch 78-rpm discs, but Beecham was not averse to recording piecemeal – his well-known 1932 disc of Chabrier's \"España\" was recorded in two sessions three weeks apart. Beecham recorded many of his favourite works several times, taking advantage of improved technology over the decades.\n\nFrom 1926 to 1932, Beecham made more than 70 discs, including an English version of Gounod's \"Faust\" and the first of three recordings of Handel's \"Messiah\". He began recording with the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1933, making more than 150 discs for Columbia, including music by Mozart, Rossini, Berlioz, Wagner, Handel, Beethoven, Brahms, Debussy and Delius. Among the most prominent of his pre-war recordings was the first complete recording of Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\" with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, made for HMV and supervised by Walter Legge in Berlin in 1937–38, a set described by Alan Blyth in \"Gramophone\" magazine in 2006 as having \"a legendary status\". In 1936, during his German tour with the LPO, Beecham conducted the world's first orchestral recording on magnetic tape, made at Ludwigshafen, the home of BASF, the company that developed the process.\n\nDuring his stay in the US and afterwards, Beecham recorded for American Columbia Records and RCA Victor. His RCA recordings include major works that he did not subsequently re-record for the gramophone, including Beethoven's Fourth, Sibelius's Sixth and Mendelssohn's Reformation Symphonies. Some of his RCA recordings were issued only in the US, including Mozart's Symphony No. 27, K199, the overtures to Smetana's \"The Bartered Bride\" and Mozart's \"La clemenza di Tito\", the Sinfonia from Bach's \"Christmas Oratorio\", a 1947–48 complete recording of Gounod's \"Faust\", and an RPO studio version of Sibelius's Second Symphony. Beecham's RCA records that were released on both sides of the Atlantic were his celebrated 1956 complete recording of Puccini's \"La bohème\" and an extravagantly rescored set of Handel's \"Messiah\". The former remains a top recommendation among reviewers, and the latter was described by \"Gramophone\" as \"an irresistible outrage … huge fun\".\n\nFor the Columbia label, Beecham recorded his last, or only, versions of many works by Delius, including \"A Mass of Life\", \"Appalachia\", \"North Country Sketches\", \"An Arabesque\", \"Paris\" and \"Eventyr\". Other Columbia recordings from the early 1950s include Beethoven's \"Eroica\", \"Pastoral\" and Eighth symphonies, Mendelssohn's \"Italian\" symphony, and the Brahms Violin Concerto with Isaac Stern.\n\nFrom his return to England at the end of the Second World War until his final recordings in 1959, Beecham continued his early association with HMV and British Columbia, who had merged to form EMI. From 1955, his EMI recordings made in London were recorded in stereo. He also recorded in Paris, with his own RPO and with the Orchestra National de la Radiodiffusion Française, though the Paris recordings were in mono until 1958. For EMI, Beecham recorded two complete operas in stereo, \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\" and \"Carmen\". His last recordings were made in Paris in December 1959. Beecham's EMI recordings have been continually reissued on LP and CD. In 2011, to mark the 50th anniversary of Beecham's death, EMI released 34 CDs of his recordings of music from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, including works by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner, Richard Strauss and Delius, and many of the French \"lollipops\" with which he was associated.\n\nBeecham's relations with fellow British conductors were not always cordial. Sir Henry Wood regarded him as an upstart and was envious of his success; the scrupulous Sir Adrian Boult found him \"repulsive\" as a man and a musician; and Sir John Barbirolli mistrusted him. Sir Malcolm Sargent worked with him in founding the London Philharmonic and was a friend and ally, but he was the subject of unkind, though witty, digs from Beecham who, for example, described the image-conscious Herbert von Karajan as \"a kind of musical Malcolm Sargent\". Beecham's relations with foreign conductors were often excellent. He did not get on well with Arturo Toscanini, but he liked and encouraged Wilhelm Furtwängler, admired Pierre Monteux, fostered Rudolf Kempe as his successor with the RPO, and was admired by Fritz Reiner, Otto Klemperer and Herbert von Karajan.\n\nDespite his lordly drawl, Beecham remained a Lancastrian at heart. \"In \"my\" county, where \"I\" come from, we're all a bit vulgar, you know, but there is a certain heartiness – a sort of bonhomie about our vulgarity – which tides you over a lot of rough spots in the path. But in \"Yorkshire\", in a spot of bother, they're so damn-set-in-their-ways that there's no doing anything with them!\"\n\nBeecham has been much quoted. In 1929, the editor of a music journal wrote, \"The stories gathered around Sir Thomas Beecham are innumerable. Wherever musicians come together, he is likely to be one of the topics of conversation. Everyone telling a Beecham story tries to imitate his manner and his tone of voice.\" A book, \"Beecham Stories\", was published in 1978 consisting entirely of his \"bons mots\" and anecdotes about him. Some are variously attributed to Beecham or one or more other people, including Arnold Bax and Winston Churchill; Neville Cardus admitted to inventing some himself. Among the Beecham lines that are reliably attributed are, \"A musicologist is a man who can read music but can't hear it\"; his maxim, \"There are only two things requisite so far as the public is concerned for a good performance: that is for the orchestra to begin together and end together; in between it doesn't matter much\"; and his remark at his 70th birthday celebrations after telegrams were read out from Strauss, Stravinsky and Sibelius: \"Nothing from Mozart?\"\n\nHe was completely indifferent to mundane tasks such as correspondence, and was less than responsible with the property of others. On one occasion, during bankruptcy proceedings, two thousand unopened letters were discovered among his papers. Havergal Brian sent him three scores with a view to having them performed. One of them, the \"Second English Suite\", was never returned and is now considered lost.\n\nBeecham was knighted in 1916 and succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father later that year. In 1938 the President of France, Albert Lebrun, invested him with the Légion d'honneur. In 1955, Beecham was presented with the Order of the White Rose of Finland. He was a Commendatore of the Order of the Crown of Italy and was made a Companion of Honour in the 1957 Queen's Birthday Honours. He was an honorary Doctor of Music of the universities of Oxford, London, Manchester and Montreal.\n\n\"Beecham\", by Caryl Brahms and Ned Sherrin, is a play celebrating the conductor and drawing on a large number of Beecham stories for its material. Its first production, in 1979, starred Timothy West in the title role. It was later adapted for television, starring West, with members of the Hallé Orchestra taking part in the action and playing pieces associated with Beecham.\n\nIn 1980 the Royal Mail put Beecham's image on the 13½p postage stamp in a series portraying British conductors; the other three in the series depicted Wood, Sargent and Barbirolli. The Sir Thomas Beecham Society preserves Beecham's legacy through its website and release of historic recordings.\n\nIn 2012, Beecham was voted into the inaugural \"Gramophone\" magazine \"Hall of Fame\".\n\nBeecham's published books were:\nThe last of these was reissued in 1975 by Severn House, London, with an introduction by Felix Aprahamian and a discography by Malcolm Walker, .\n\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n"}

Starting in 1988, the show ran 50 weekends of the year until the end of 2016. As its subtitle states, the show consists of 30 short plays performed in a 60-minute space, written, directed, and performed by a small ensemble called the Neo-Futurists. The plays tend to be a mixture of autobiography and performance art, as with much of the Neo-Futurists' work. The Neo-Futurists continued their 50 weekend a year performing streak with a new show titled \"The Infinite Wrench\" in 2017.\n\nNeo-Futurism as an aesthetic, as well as the format of TMLMTBGB, are both creations of founder Greg Allen, although, due to the changing roster of plays in \"TMLMTBGB\", Allen did not actually have a play in the show at all times during its run. In 2003, Allen ceased to be a member of the performing ensemble. The Neo-Futurism aesthetic is a variant of the early 20th century Italian Futurism movement. Greg Allen came up with the name from a young autistic child who would smash light bulbs and say, \"Too much light makes the baby go blind\". Later, when he was creating this show, the saying came back to his mind.\n\nTo date, three volumes of plays from the show have been published.\n\nIn November 2016, Allen revoked the Neo-Futurists' rights to perform \"TMLMTBGB\" in a surprise announcement.\n\nOn February 28th, 2017, The Neo-Futurists in Chicago, The San Francisco Neo-Futurists and the New York Neo-Futurists all launched an ongoing run of a new show titled \"The Infinite Wrench\"..\n\nThe show is the work of the Neo-Futurism movement, a variant of the Italian Futurism movement and reflects their aesthetic of non-illusory theater, where, as they describe it, \"all of our plays are 'set' on the stage in front of the audience. All of our 'characters' are ourselves... We do not aim to 'suspend the audience's disbelief' but to create a world where the stage is a continuation of daily life\" (Allen 3).\n\nThe ticket price for the show is random, with a fixed number (currently $9 for the Chicago show, $13 for the New York show, and $10 for the San Francisco show) being added to the roll of a six-sided die for each person. Upon payment, a member of the cast shouts \"What's your name?\" at the audience member before giving him or her a nametag with a random and unrelated \"name\". Audience members are given a \"menu\" of play titles, and plays are selected by audience members shouting their number, with the first number heard being the play performed. Many of the plays contain elements of randomness and audience interaction; plays end when a member of the cast shouts \"curtain!\" \n\nThe list of plays is perpetually rotating. Every week between two and twelve plays (determined by two rolls of a die by someone in the audience) are removed from the \"menu\" and replaced with new plays, written in the course of the week. \n\nAs part of a lighthearted tradition, when a particular evening sells out, the cast orders pizza from a local restaurant, allowing the audience to shout out toppings. Only a single pizza is ordered, however, which the entire audience must share.\n\nA second Neo-Futurist company was founded in New York City in April 2004. The New York Neo-Futurists perform TMLMTBGB at the Kraine Theater in the East Village. This production has its own ensemble members, and thus contains different short plays from the Chicago show. In 2006, the New York Neo-Futurists were the recipients of the New York Innovative Theatre Awards Outstanding Performance Art Production.\n\nIn 2014, a third Neo-Futurist company was founded in San Francisco by producer Lucy Tafler and New York Neo-Futurist alum Adam Smith, performing in various venues in San Francisco's Theatre District. In 2016, they were voted San Francisco's Best Theater Company in the SF Bay Guardian's \"Best of the Bay\" Reader's Poll. Like the New York Neo-Futurists, the troupe has their own ensemble members and plays. As of July 2015, they perform at SAFEhouse for the Performing Arts.\n\n\"Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind\" premiered in the state of Tennessee in the spring of 2016 in Nashville with a Gadabout Theater Company production. \n\nAllen, Greg. \"100 Neo-Futurist Plays from Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind\".

The books are credited to the Bathroom Readers' Institute, though Uncle John is a real person, and are published by Portable Press, an imprint of Printer's Row Publishing Group. The introductions in the books, as well as brief notes in some articles, provide small pieces of information about Uncle John. The first book was published in 1988, and in 2012, the series reached its 25th release, The \"Fully Loaded 25th Anniversary Bathroom Reader\".\n\nVolumes dedicated to a single topic have been released, under the title \"Uncle John Plunges Into...\", for example: history, presidents, and the universe. There are also books on individual U.S. states, the weather, numbers, quotes, the year 2000, a special book for mothers, cat lovers, dog lovers, horse lovers, love, \"Uncle John's Book of the Dumb\", and several \"Bathroom Readers for Kids Only!\". Though most of the books were written by the Bathroom Readers' Institute, some of the ones that are based around a specific subject are written by a lone author, who is not in the Institute. Additionally, the Institute will often publish articles and other contributions sent in from readers. Recurring articles such as \"Flubbed Headlines\", \"Oops\", and \"Classifieds\" often depend on these contributions. Currently, the institute publishes three books a year; a \"classic\" reader, and two \"plunges into\" editions, one for a location such as a U.S. state, and another of a specific topic.\n\nTheir volumes contain information on subjects such as quotes, dumb criminals, palindromes, anagrams, urban legends and hoaxes, failed inventions, the history of everyday things, and accidental discoveries, as well as articles on pop culture and 'celebrities' such as Emperor Norton (see Features). Throughout the books, there are what the BRI calls \"running feet\" - short fun facts on the bottom of each page. A typical example is \"An object on Jupiter would weigh 144,000 times more than it would on Pluto.\" Some books have one running foot that simply says \"Hi, mom.\".\n\nUncle John's also publishes Page-a-Day calendars with Workman Publishing Company.\n\nThe series has sold 15 million copies.\n\nAmong the regular articles in the books are:\n\n\nThe Bathroom Readers' Institute began in 1988, with the publishing of the original \"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader\", by St. Martin's Press Publishers. After the book's success, \"Uncle John's 2nd Bathroom Reader\" was published in 1989, with a third and a fourth book being added to the series in the subsequent years. These earlier books are distinct from the rest not only due to their short length, but because of the writing style: Short articles starting with a brief history of the subject, followed by several tidbits on the subject.\n\nAfter the initial four books, the BRI decided that it would publish further volumes under its own label, and \"Uncle John's 5th Bathroom Reader\" was released in October 1992; notable for a revised writing style, more and longer articles, and the introduction of new recurring features, \"Uncle John's 5th\" set what would become the standard design for every book going forward. The Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Bathroom Reader went out of print in 1994, and would later be re-released as a single volume, \"Uncle John's Legendary Lost Bathroom Reader\". In 1995, the millionth copy of the series was sold, and to celebrate the milestone, the BRI released an eighth volume, \"The Best of Uncle John's Bathroom Reader\".\n\nIn 1996, the Bathroom Readers' Institute revised its writing style yet again, adopting a more 'encyclopedic' style, as well as spreading longer articles throughout the book.\n\nFor the first 15 years, \"Bathroom Readers\" referred to just one series. Now, there were several competitors (none quite as successful) and quite a few series \"within\" the BRI. Books 15–18 began to move away from the format seen in previous books, using two- and three-part articles, and sometimes removing popular recurring features in favor of the longer format. In 2012, \"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader\" celebrated its 25th anniversary with the publication of \"Fully Loaded 25th Anniversary Bathroom Reader\".\n\nBesides the annual editions and omnibuses, many topic specific editions were also published. These editions focused on such things like individual U.S. states, history, national parks, Hollywood, television, the U.S. Armed Forces, the environment, etc. These have ceased publishing since 2013.\n\n"}
