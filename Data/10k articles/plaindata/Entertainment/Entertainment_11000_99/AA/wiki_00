It is a simple and effective method of ensuring synchronization between sound and picture in a video or film.\n\nA 2-pop is typically placed at the end of a visual countdown. Only the first frame of the \"2\" is shown, and the remainder of the 2 seconds prior to the program is black. This provides a unique point of reference where the frame-long image and frame-long sound should align, similar to the way a film clapperboard is used to generate a synchronization point.\n\nFor example, in a television or video program the first frame of action (FFOA) starts at one hour (typically timecode of 01:00:00:00 in the US, and 10:00:00:00 in the UK), preceding that, 1 frame (or the 2-pop) of tone would be placed at timecode 00:59:58:00 or exactly 2 seconds before first picture. Alternately, in film post-production the leader starts at 01:00:00:00 (or 0+00 feet if using feet and frames as is common in the United States), the 2-pop starts at 01:00:06:00 (or 9+00), and the first frame of action (FFOA) starts at 01:00:08:00 (or 12+00). \n\nA 2-pop is useful whenever picture and sound are handled separately. For example, projecting work-in-progress in the pre-video days involved a film projector linked to a magnetic dubber, onto which the separate soundtrack reel was loaded. Aligning them by the 2-pop would ensure proper synchronization during playback. A modern scenario would involve sending a soundtrack to a separate facility for a sound mix. The returned product is a computer audio file which then needs to be synchronized again with the picture.\n\nWhereas laying down bars and tone prior to program start establishes video and audio calibration levels on the tape, the 2-pop is primarily used for picture and sound synchronization. Therefore, while the loudness of the 2-pop may be the same as the bars and tone audio level in use, this is not a requirement. The loudness level should be sufficient to be heard clearly.\n\n"}
{"id": "38605865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38605865", "title": "Ajoka Theatre", "text": "Ajoka Theatre\n\nAjoka Theatre (Urdu: , literal translation of \"Ajoka\": \"today/present\") is a Pakistani not-for-profit arts organization based in Lahore, Punjab, with focus on producing and performing social theatrical stage productions, founded in 1984. The group was formed by director, actress and playwright, Madeeha Gauhar at peak of the tensions during the state of emergency under the regime of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. Ajoka Theatre received the prestigious Prince Claus Award in 2006 and the International Theatre Pasta Award in 2007.\n\nSince its inception, the group have staged many popular society critical pieces in theatres, on the streets and in public spaces, as well as in productions for television and on video. Ajoka Theatre has not only performed in Pakistan, but has also in the South Asian region, in countries like India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, as well as in Europe and United States of America. The group focuses on promotion of a just, humane, secular and equal society, alongside the subject of women's rights in a society that is greatly dominated by men.\n\nThe groups first ever theatrical performance was \"Jaloos (Procession)\" written by veteran Indian playwright Badal Sarkar. The style of Ajoka's performances can be characterised as an elaboration on the oral tradition of Bhand and Nautanki that found a flourishing base in the area that currently overlaps the province of Punjab. In spite of the Western education of Gauhar, she does not limit herself to classical Western theatre techniques. Instead, she mixes authentic Pakistani elements, combining it with contemporary sentiments.\n\nGauhar was born in 1956 in Karachi. After she obtained a Master of Arts degree in English literature, she moved to England where she obtained another master's degree, in theatre sciences at the University of London. In 1983, after returning to Lahore, Gauhar and her husband Shahid Nadeem founded Ajoka Theatre, the first theatre group of significance there. \nIn 2007, Ajoka performed a piece that was written and directed by Gauhar, called \"Burqavaganza\" (\"Burqa-vaganza\"), which led to great controversy. Actors dressed in burkas put themes on the stage like sexual discrimination, intolerance and fanaticism. From a Western perspective, the piece was a rather innocent performance on hypocrisy of a society that bathes in corruption. In her own country though, Members of Parliament called for a ban of it, and the Minister of Culture threatened with sanctions when it would be staged any longer. In spite of the ban, non-governmental organisations and women's rights activists had the theatre piece translated into English and staged performances internationally as an sign of support to Ajoka.\n\nOn 23 August 2008, Alhamra Arts Council hosted the launch of \"Selected Plays\" published by Oxford University Press (OUP) and written by Shahid Nadeem with the help of Ajoka. The book contains seven of his famous plays \"Teesri Dastak\", \"Barri\", \"Aik Thi Nani\", \"Kala Meda Bhes\", \"Dukhini\", \"Bulha\" and \"Burqavaganza\". The book again launched at the Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA), Islamabad on 25 August 2008 with the help of Pakistan Academy of Letters. His book, \"Selected Plays\", a collection of his six famous plays in an English translation was published by OUP in August 2008. Two collections of his Urdu and Punjabi plays has been published.\n\nIn 2012, Nadeem wrote a play \"Kaun Hai Yeh Gustakh\", directed by Madeeha Gauhar and first played at Alhamra Arts Council, Lahore on 14 December by Ajoka. The play is based on the life of Saadat Hassan Manto, and was well received by audiences. Manto was played by \"Naseem Abbas\". In January 2013 the play was presented at the \"Akshara Theatre\" in New Delhi, India. The play was due to be presented at the National School of Drama (NSD) in New Delhi but was cancelled due to security concerns. In February 2013, play was held at Nishtar Hall, Peshawar by Ajoka.\n\nAjoka Theatre has staged several theatrical performances, mostly all plays have been adapted or written by Madeeha Gauhar and Shahid Nadeem.\n\n"}
{"id": "4964468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4964468", "title": "Antichamber", "text": "Antichamber\n\nAntichamber is a puzzle-platform game created by Australian developer Alexander \"Demruth\" Bruce. Many of the puzzles are based on phenomena that occur within impossible objects created by the game engine, such as passages that lead the player to different locations depending on which way they face, and structures that seem otherwise impossible within normal three-dimensional space. The game includes elements of psychological exploration through brief messages of advice to help the player figure out solutions to the puzzles as well as adages for real life. The game was released on Steam for Microsoft Windows on January 31, 2013, a version sold with the Humble Indie Bundle 11 in February 2014 added support for Linux and OS X.\n\nIn \"Antichamber\", the player controls the unnamed protagonist from a first-person perspective as they wander through levels. Regarding typical notions of Euclidean space, Bruce has stated that \"breaking down all those expectations and then remaking them is essentially the core mechanic of the game\".\n\nThe player starts in an antechamber that contains four walls. One is a diegetic menu to set the various game options as well as a countdown timer starting at ninety minutes. A second wall provides a map of the game's space that will fill in as the player visits specific rooms, highlighting passages the player has yet to explore, and allows the player, upon return to this room, to jump to any room they've visited before. A third wall shows a series of cartoonish iconographs and obfuscated hint text that are added as the player finds these on walls of the puzzle space. The fourth wall is a window, showing the ultimate goal, the exit from the space, which the player must figure out how to get to.\n\nPuzzle elements in various chambers involve maneuvering themselves around the spaces, where level elements can change after passing certain points, or even based on which direction the player is facing when traversing the level. Laser beams are used as mechanisms to control various doors; these may either require the beams to be blocked or unblocked, and many doors require multiple beams to be in their proper state to open. Initially, the player can trigger these themselves. Later, the player gains access to a series of colored \"guns\", each which helps the player access more of the space. Initially, the gun can pick up any number of small cubes, storing them, and then place them on surfaces; these can be used to block the aforementioned laser beams, or used as platforms for the player to get over obstacles. Other guns can be used to \"grow\" new blocks by placing blocks out in specific patterns, to direct a connected series of blocks towards an objective point, and to mass create and fill an area with blocks; later guns retain the abilities of the earlier ones. Certain areas in the space are dead zones that remove any blocks stored in the gun or prevent blocks from moving through them. After most puzzles are signs with the forementioned iconographs which can be activated to give a hint about the just-completed puzzle. At any point, the player can jump back to the first room, and use the map to navigate to other areas; this resets any progress made on specific puzzles though the player retains the guns they have obtained.\n\nUpon completing a core set of puzzles, the player can then access the exit door, upon which they start to chase down a black cloudlike shape, using all the solving techniques they have learned before. Eventually they are able to capture the cloud as a black cube within their gun, and enter a final, more expansive area, where they return the shape to a waiting shell. The shell creates a structure around it – similar to the game's logo – and then sucks everything around it into its center, sending the screen to black and ending the game.\n\n\"Antichamber\" started as early as 2006 as Bruce's idea for an arena combat game based on expanding the mechanics of the game \"Snake\" into a multiplayer experience. Full development of the game, initially called \"Hazard\", did not start until 2009 and continued into 2010. Bruce developed the game using UnrealScript with the Unreal Engine 3. As Bruce iterated through its design, he dropped the combat portion and chose to focus more on a single-player puzzle game along with the psychology of the puzzles, eventually adding the subtitle \"The Journey of Life\" in 2009. Part of this change came about how he was able to create Impossible Object spaces within the Unreal Engine, which came about as a result of a \"rookie error\" in coding. Bruce recognized that there was a single-player game behind creating spaces and puzzles where the player would have to work out how the rules work, and expanded the game in that direction. Bruce said in a 2011 interview with Kotaku that \"the game started off as being all about geometry...I needed to find a way to represent that [non-physical geometry] to players...so I needed to work out why we would need this non-physical geometry in the world and it took me a couple years but after combining geometry and space and perception, I realized that the real reason that this game is interesting and is working is because it's about psychology.\" As he worked out puzzles, he found that injecting philosophical ideas helped to lead to puzzle designs or otherwise augment established puzzles, and made that part of \"Antichamber\"'s approach. The game's simple art style was partially to distinguish the game from other Unreal Engine games, while also to aid in masking the work behind the inverse lighting system used in the game.\n\nOn April 2, 2012, \"Antichamber\" became the seventh game to receive funding from the Indie Fund with Bruce citing the award as \"finishing funds\" to ensure the game can be released in 2012, and was ultimately released in January 2013.\n\nThe soundtrack for Antichamber consists of ambient music composed by Siddhartha Barnhoorn. The music evolves over the course of the game, starting with nothing more than one ambient layer in the first level and gradually progressing into a complex soundscape. In an interview with IndieGames.com, Barnhoorn revealed that the soundtrack comprises sounds from various guitars, the shakuhachi, the koto, and synth pads. In addition, Barnhoorn stated that the non-synth sounds are digitally manipulated \"here and there in order to make the sounds a bit longer than they would appear naturally\". \"Antichamber Suite\", a track consisting of music from the game, was released via Bandcamp on February 13, 2012. The track was also featured in the Nubuwo Debut Bundle released March 2, 2012. The full soundtrack was released on February 18, 2013.\n\n\"Antichamber\" was well received by critics prior to its commercial release. In 2009 the game was featured in the showcase at the Tokyo Game Show Sense of Wonder Night, and was a finalist in the Independent Games Festival China. In 2010, indiePub Games's third Independent Game Developers' Competition awarded \"Antichamber\" the prize for Technical Excellence. In 2011 the game was as a finalist in GameStop's Indie Game Challenge, and in the \"Make Something Unreal\" competition (run by Epic Games), the game won 1st for Best Level for a Mod in Phase 4, 3rd for Best non-FPS Mod in Phase 4, and 5th place overall in the grand finals. During the 2011 Independent Games Festival, \"Antichamber\" wound up as a finalist for the Nuovo Award, which recognizes \"abstract, short-form, and unconventional game development.\" Also in 2011, the game made it into the PAX 10 and finished as a finalist in the IndieCade festival. In 2012, \"Antichamber\" took home the Technical Excellence Award at the Independent Games Festival.\n\n\"Antichamber\" has received critical acclaim, with score aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings giving overall scores of 82/100 and 83.70% respectively.\n\nMost reviewers praised the level design and puzzles in the game. \"Game Informer\" wrote that \"I rarely ever felt stuck or frustrated by a lack of progress – a testament to Antichamber's pacing and design\", and GameTrailers said \"The true star of Antichamber is its level design.\" \"PC Gamer\" described the game as hosting \"moments of transcendent beauty and vignettes that engage your brain on a level few games attempt\" and IGN called the puzzles \"expertly crafted and wonderfully inventive challenges.\"\n\nWithin two months of its release on Steam the game sold more than 100,000 copies, with most of the sales coming during the first week of release.\n"}
{"id": "1334997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1334997", "title": "Apala", "text": "Apala\n\nApala (or Akpala) is a musical genre, originally derived from the Yoruba people of Nigeria.\nIt is a percussion-based style that developed in the late 1930s, when it was used to wake worshippers after fasting during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The rhythms of apala grew more complex over time, influenced by Cuban music and eventually became quite popular in Kannada. It has grown less religious centered over time.\n\nInstruments include a rattle (sekere), thumb piano (agidigbo) and a bell (agogô), as well as two or three talking drums.\n\nHaruna Ishola is undoubtedly the best-known performer of apala in Nigerian history. Others may hold a contrary view that Ayinla Omowura is better known, and the most successful musician of Apala. Both of them played an integral role in the popularization of the genre, and it is distinct from, older than, and much more difficult to master than fuji music. Although Ayninla Omowura died in his forties in 1980, he recorded more than 20 LPs and remarkably, all are very successful.\n\nAlthough Fuji music remains the most important form of traditional music amongst Yorubas in Nigeria, apala is still very popular amongst Muslims of the Yoruba tribe. Special mention must be given to Haruna Ishola's son, Musiliu Haruna Ishola, who is often credited with revitalizing the apala genre and spearheading the apala-resurgence of the 2000s.\n\nWith his 2000 album (entitled Soyoyo), Musiliu has succeeded in bringing apala music to a wider, younger audience, thus breathing new life to the genre and keeping the tradition (and his father's legacy) alive. He is credited with re-popularizing a genre that was fast becoming the preserve of older Muslims of the Yoruba tribe. The success of his Soyoyo album meant that a younger (often Christian or Animist) generation of Yorubas have now demonstrated a renewed interest in apala music. His songs can often be heard on popular radio stations across Yorubaland.\n"}

The game was notable for its unique take on the genre and approach to mathematical entities and abstract concepts.\nIn one section the player must navigate a text adventure game, inside the text adventure game. In another the player, while asleep, derives a proof using physical representations of various symbolic logic components.\n\nThe game is intentionally vague using a VERB NOUN gameplay mechanic with a vocabulary of just 200.\n\nIn 1988 the game was ported to Atari ST, MS-DOS and Solaris environments and, in 2003, to interactive fiction standard of machine-independent Z-code.\n\nScenario:\nYou have reached the final part of your mission. You have\ngained access to the complex, and all but the last procedure has\nbeen performed. Now comes a time of waiting, in which you must\nsearch for the hidden 12-word message that will aid you at the\nfinal step. But what choice will you make when that time comes?\n\nThe scenario for the adventure is meant to be vague. Once the\nadventure has been completed, the scenario will hopefully become\nclear.\n\nInstructions:\nThis adventure recognizes the standard commands for moving\n(N,E,S,W), taking inventory (I), maninpulating objects (GET,\nDROP, LOOK), and saving games (SAVE, LOAD), as well as many\nothers. Use 2-word 'verb noun' commands, such as 'use stack' or\n'get all'. Only the first four letters of each word are\nsignificant. The adventure recognizes about 200 words, so if\none word doesn't work, try another.\n\nNotes:\nThe \"stack\" is an acroynym for Space Time Activated Continuum\nKey. You will find this object very useful. Try the command\n\"use stack\".\n\nThis adventure is abstract and a bit on the technical side.\nBasic knowledge of the names of interesting mathematical objects\nwould be a definite asset in solving the puzzles. However,\ndetailed knowledge of the technical background is not necessary,\nalthough it will make the adventure more enjoyable and reduce\nthe amount of comments of the form \"Was that supposed to be funny\nor what? I don't get it.\"\n\nThere is no carry limit, no death traps, and over 200 words in\nthe program's vocabulary, so you can hopefully concentrate on\nsolving the adventure instead of solving the program. The map\nof the adventure can be draw on a grid. All it takes is a\nlittle experimenting to put all the subsets of locations\ntogether \"logically\".\n\nHistory:\nThe idea of a mathematically abstract adventure came about\nduring the summer of 1983, when I was reading the book \"Godel,\nEscher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid\". I had just read an\narticle on writing adventures, and I thought about doing my own\narticle on adventure writing. I did start on the article, and\none of the examples of how varied puzzles can be is a\nmathematical adventure where the player has to \"use a\nprobability function to cross a field of improbability to get to\na vortex.\" Sadly the article was never finished, although\nremnants of it can be found in the ADV.DOC file. I started\nthinking more and more about a mathematically abstract\nadventure, and Tesseract was born!\n\nThe very first adventure that I wrote was in 1982, titled \"Hall\nof the Mountain King\" (find the Crystal of Light). Tesseract\nVersion 1.0 was the second of the three TRS-80 BASIC adventures\nthat I wrote in a two-month adventure-frenzy during the summer\nof 1983. The first was \"Project Triad\" (defuse the bomb on the\nspace station), and the third was \"Codename Intrepid\" (deliver a\npackage to another agent).\n\nTesseract was meant to be a sequel to Project Triad, but when it was\nfinished I found that it had no solid relation to Triad. The program\nstarted from an example I used when I tried to write an article on how\nto write an adventure. The example, as far as I could remember it, was\n\"using a definitive function to get by a field of improbability.\"\nThe word play in Tesseract is the acrostic. The first letter of the\nimportant words in the hidden message form the word \"tesseract.\" Since\nthe message also contains the word \"tesseract\", the message can be\nthought of as self-containing. The \"hint\" to an acrostic is the stack\n(Space-Time Activated Continuum Key). The 12-word message is:\n\nThe message is divided into 4 lines, with each line being presented at\nthe end of its puzzle.\n\n1. Book World\n\nThe fractals worlds used to be vegetables beings (nursery/peach baby,\n\"Gather No Moss\" Concert/asparagus youth, hyper-lab/potato assistant,\nlettuce scientist) performing tasks that the player needs use in\nsolving the puzzles. There was some humour/logic to the selection of\nthe vegetables and beings, but the reason is so obtuse it makes the\nFar Side look logical.\n\nI was going to have dust on the mountain, then melt the snowflake to\ngrow a fractal plant, which is the prequel to the plant-being in the\nmirror world.\n\n2. Prism\n\n3. Dream World\n\nThis provides a foreshadowing of the ending.\n\n4. Plant Being\n\nThe TRS-80 version didn't use _Y_, which was my internal notation.\nThe _'s were replaced with random consonants (e.g. byk, tyv, etc.) at\nrun-time.\n\nThe function and integral is analogous to a weapon v.s. monster puzzle\n(the sword has many sharp points, and the monster is vicious.) During\nthe translation, I thought of using a glider gun and a dragon curve,\nbut somehow that was replaced by the function and integral.\nOriginally there was no integral or function. Instead, there was a\none-sided polygon that you spin to get a mono-filter.\n\n"}

She has sung at Tiki Oasis and tiki clubs across the country. \nIn 2005, she was a featured performer in the cult classic movie by Tony Marsico, \"Camp Burlesque\". Capri has made appearances on television talk shows including the \"Tonight Show\" with Jay Leno.\n\nIn 2006 she was featured on the full-length album \"Creamy Cocktails & Other Delights\" with a cover that paid a fun homage to the classic album cover \"Whipped Cream and Other Delights\" by Herb Alpert. Her title song from this album was included as the main anthem in the same-sex marriage rights movie, \"I Want to Get Married\".\n\nIn 2007, she was approached to star in a MidMod home-improvement lifestyle show called \"Lotta Living\", based on the website of the same name. The series ultimately failed to progress past development stages.\n\nIn 2016 she was considered for a children's television show reprising a Fred Rogers-style lead in an updated version of \"Mr. Roger's Neighborhood\".\n\nOver the years, Capri has supported various charitable organizations through performances and appearances, including the Los Angeles Conservancy Modern Committee, Palm Springs Modern Committee and Lightbringer Project.

{"id": "10791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10791", "title": "Cinema of China", "text": "Cinema of China\n\nThe cinema of China is one of three distinct historical threads of Chinese-language cinema together with the cinema of Hong Kong and the cinema of Taiwan.\n\nCinema was introduced in China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, \"The Battle of Dingjunshan\", was made in 1905, with the film industry being centered on Shanghai in the first decades. The first sound film, \"Sing-Song Girl Red Peony\", using the sound-on-disc technology, was made in 1931. The 1930s, considered the first \"golden period\" of Chinese cinema, saw the advent of the Leftist cinematic movement and the dispute between Nationalists and Communists was reflected in the films produced. After the Japanese invasion of China and the occupation of Shanghai, the industry in the city was severely curtailed, with filmmakers moving to Hong Kong, Chongqing and other places, starting a \"Solitary Island\" period in Shanghai, referring to the city's foreign concessions, with the remaining filmmakers working there. \"Princess Iron Fan\" (1941), the first Chinese animated feature film, was released at the end of this period. It influenced wartime Japanese animation and later Osamu Tezuka. After being completely engulfed by the occupation in 1941, and until the end of the war in 1945, the film industry in the city was under Japanese control.\n\nAfter the end of the war, a second golden age took place, with production in Shanghai resuming, with films such as \"Spring in a Small Town\" (1948), named the best Chinese-language film at the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards. After the communist revolution in 1949, previous and some foreign films were banned in 1951, and movie attendance increased sharply. During the Cultural Revolution, the film industry was severely restricted, coming almost to a standstill from 1967 to 1972. The industry flourished following the end of the Cultural Revolution, including the \"scar dramas\" of the 1980s, such as \"Evening Rain\" (1980), \"Legend of Tianyun Mountain\" (1980) and \"Hibiscus Town\" (1986), depicting the emotional traumas left by the period. Starting in the mid to late 1980s, with films such as \"One and Eight\" (1983) and \"Yellow Earth\" (1984), the rise of the Fifth Generation brought increased popularity to Chinese cinema abroad, especially among Western arthouse audiences, with films like \"Red Sorghum\" (1987), \"The Story of Qiu Ju\" (1992) and \"Farewell My Concubine\" (1993) winning major international awards. The movement partially ended after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The post-1990 period saw the rise of the Sixth Generation and post-Sixth Generation, both mostly making films outside the main Chinese film system and played mostly on the international film festival circuit.\n\nFollowing the international commercial success of films such as \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" (2000) and \"Hero\" (2002), the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema has increased and there has been a movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. After \"The Dream Factory\" (1997) demonstrated the viability of the commercial model, and with the growth of the Chinese box office in the new millennium, Chinese films have broken box office records and, as of January 2017, 5 of the top 10 highest-grossing films in China are domestic productions. \"Lost in Thailand\" (2012) was the first Chinese film to reach at the Chinese box office, \"Monster Hunt\" (2015) was the first to reach , \"The Mermaid\" (2016) was the first to and \"Wolf Warrior 2\" (2017) is currently the highest-grossing film in China.\n\nChina is the home of the largest movie & drama production complex and film studios in the world, the Oriental Movie Metropolis and Hengdian World Studios, and in 2010 it had the third largest film industry by number of feature films produced annually. In 2012 the country became the second-largest market in the world by box office receipts. In 2016, the gross box office in China was (). The country has the largest number of screens in the world since 2016, and is expected to become the largest theatrical market by 2019. China has also become a major hub of business for Hollywood studios.\n\nIn November 2016, China passed a film law banning content deemed harmful to the “dignity, honor and interests” of the People’s Republic and encouraging the promotion of “socialist core values\", approved by the National People’s Congress Standing Committee.\n\nMotion pictures were introduced to China in 1896. The first recorded screening of a motion picture in China occurred in Shanghai on August 11, 1896, as an \"act\" on a variety bill. The first Chinese film, a recording of the Peking opera, \"The Battle of Dingjunshan\", was made in November 1905 in Beijing. For the next decade the production companies were mainly foreign-owned, and the domestic film industry was centered on Shanghai, a thriving entrepot and the largest city in the Far East. In 1913, the first independent Chinese screenplay, \"The Difficult Couple\", was filmed in Shanghai by Zheng Zhengqiu and Zhang Shichuan. Zhang Shichuan then set up the first Chinese-owned film production company in 1916. The first truly successful home-grown feature film was \"Yan Ruisheng\" () released in 1921. During the 1920s film technicians from the United States trained Chinese technicians in Shanghai, and American influence continued to be felt there for the next two decades.\n\nIt was during this period that some of the more important production companies first came into being, notably Mingxing (\"Star\") and the Shaw brothers' Tianyi (\"Unique\"). Mingxing, founded by Zheng Zhengqiu and Zhang Shichuan in 1922, initially focused on comic shorts, including the oldest surviving complete Chinese film, \"Laborer's Love\" (1922). This soon shifted, however, to feature-length films and family dramas including \"Orphan Rescues Grandfather\" (1923). Meanwhile, Tianyi shifted their model towards folklore dramas, and also pushed into foreign markets; their film \"White Snake\" (1926) proved a typical example of their success in the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia. In 1931, the first Chinese sound film \"Sing-Song Girl Red Peony\" was made, the product of a cooperation between the Mingxing Film Company's image production and Pathé Frères's sound technology. However, the sound was disc-recorded, and the first sound-on-film talkie made in China was either \"Spring on Stage\" (歌場春色) by Tianyi, or \"Clear Sky After Storm\" by Great China Studio and Jinan Studio.\n\nHowever, the first truly important Chinese films were produced beginning in the 1930s, with the advent of the \"progressive\" or \"left-wing\" movement, like Cheng Bugao's \"Spring Silkworms\" (1933), Wu Yonggang's \"The Goddess\" (1934), and Sun Yu's \"The Big Road\" (1935). These films were noted for their emphasis on class struggle and external threats (i.e. Japanese aggression), as well as on their focus on common people, such as a family of silk farmers in \"Spring Silkworms\" and a prostitute in \"The Goddess\". In part due to the success of these kinds of films, this post-1930 era is now often referred to as the first \"golden period\" of Chinese cinema. The Leftist cinematic movement often revolved around the Western-influenced Shanghai, where filmmakers portrayed the struggling lower class of an overpopulated city.\n\nThree production companies dominated the market in the early to mid- 1930s: the newly formed Lianhua (\"United China\"), the older and larger Mingxing and Tianyi. Both Mingxing and Lianhua leaned left (Lianhua's management perhaps more so), while Tianyi continued to make less socially conscious fare.\n\nThe period also produced the first big Chinese movie stars, such as Hu Die, Ruan Lingyu, Li Lili, Chen Yanyan, Zhou Xuan, Zhao Dan and Jin Yan. Other major films of the period include \"Love and Duty\" (1931), \"Little Toys\" (1933), \"New Women\" (1934), \"Song of the Fishermen\" (1934), \"Plunder of Peach and Plum\" (1934), \"Crossroads\" (1937), and \"Street Angel\" (1937). Throughout the 1930s, the Nationalists and the Communists struggled for power and control over the major studios; their influence can be seen in the films the studios produced during this period.\n\nThe Japanese invasion of China in 1937, in particular the Battle of Shanghai, ended this golden run in Chinese cinema. All production companies except Xinhua Film Company (\"New China\") closed shop, and many of the filmmakers fled Shanghai, relocating to Hong Kong, the wartime Nationalist capital Chongqing, and elsewhere. The Shanghai film industry, though severely curtailed, did not stop however, thus leading to the \"Solitary Island\" period (also known as the \"Sole Island\" or \"Orphan Island\"), with Shanghai's foreign concessions serving as an \"island\" of production in the \"sea\" of Japanese-occupied territory. It was during this period that artists and directors who remained in the city had to walk a fine line between staying true to their leftist and nationalist beliefs and Japanese pressures. Director Bu Wancang's \"Mulan Joins the Army\" (1939), with its story of a young Chinese peasant fighting against a foreign invasion, was a particularly good example of Shanghai's continued film-production in the midst of war. This period ended when Japan declared war on the Western allies on December 7, 1941; the solitary island was finally engulfed by the sea of the Japanese occupation. With the Shanghai industry firmly in Japanese control, films like the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere-promoting \"Eternity\" (1943) were produced. At the end of World War II, one of the most controversial Japanese-authorized company, Manchukuo Film Association, would be separated and integrated into Chinese cinema.\n\nThe film industry continued to develop after 1945. Production in Shanghai once again resumed as a new crop of studios took the place that Lianhua and Mingxing had occupied in the previous decade. In 1946, Cai Chusheng returned to Shanghai to revive the Lianhua name as the \"Lianhua Film Society.\" This in turn became Kunlun Studios which would go on to become one of the most important studios of the era, putting out the classics \"The Spring River Flows East\" (1947), \"Myriad of Lights\" (1948), \"Crows and Sparrows\" (1949) and \"San Mao, The Little Vagabond\" (1949).\nMany of these films showed the disillusionment with the oppressive rule of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party. \"The Spring River Flows East\", a three-hour-long two-parter directed by Cai Chusheng and Zheng Junli, was a particularly strong success. Its depiction of the struggles of ordinary Chinese during the Second Sino-Japanese war, replete with biting social and political commentary, struck a chord with audiences of the time.\n\nMeanwhile, companies like the Wenhua Film Company (\"Culture Films\"), moved away from the leftist tradition and explored the evolution and development of other dramatic genres. Wenhua treated postwar problems in universalistic and humanistic ways, avoiding the family narrative and melodramatic formulae. Excellent examples of Wenhua's fare are its first two postwar features, \"Unending Emotions\" (1947) and \"Fake Bride, Phony Bridegroom\" (1947). Another memorable Wenhua film is \"Long Live the Missus\" (1947), like \"Unending Emotions\" with an original screenplay by writer Eileen Chang. Wenhua's romantic drama \"Spring in a Small Town\" (1948), a film by director Fei Mu shortly prior to the revolution, is often regarded by Chinese film critics as one of the most important films in the history of Chinese cinema, with it being named by the Hong Kong Film Awards in 2004 as the greatest Chinese-language film ever made. Ironically, it was precisely its artistic quality and apparent lack of \"political grounding\" that led to its labeling by the Communists as rightist or reactionary, and the film was quickly forgotten by those on the mainland following the Communist victory in China in 1949. However, with the China Film Archive's re-opening after the Cultural Revolution, a new print was struck from the original negative, allowing \"Spring of the Small Town\" to find a new and admiring audience and to influence an entire new generation of filmmakers. Indeed, an acclaimed remake was made in 2002 by Tian Zhuangzhuang. \"Remorse at Death\" (1948), by the same director, was the first Chinese color film.\n\nWith the communist revolution in China in 1949, the government saw motion pictures as an important mass production art form and tool for propaganda. Starting from 1951, pre-1949 Chinese films, Hollywood and Hong Kong productions were banned as the Communist Party of China sought to tighten control over mass media, producing instead movies centering on peasants, soldiers and workers, such as \"Bridge\" (1949) and \"The White Haired Girl\" (1950). One of the production bases in the middle of all the transition was the Changchun Film Studio.\n\nThe private studios in Shanghai, including Kunming, Wenhua, Guotai and Datong, were encouraged to make new films from 1949 to 1951. They made approximately 47 films during this period, but soon ran into trouble, owing to the furore over the Kunlun-produced drama \"The Life of Wu Xun\" (1950), directed by Sun Yu and starring veteran Zhao Dan. The feature was accused in an anonymous article in \"People's Daily\" in May 1951 of spreading feudal ideas. After the article was revealed to be penned by Mao Zedong, the film was banned, a Film Steering Committee was formed to \"re-educate\" the film industry and within two years, these private studios were all incorporated into the state-run Shanghai Film Studio.\n\nThe Communist regime solved the problem of a lack of film theaters by building mobile projection units which could tour the remote regions of China, ensuring that even the poorest could have access to films. By 1965 there were around 20,393 such units. The number of movie-viewers hence increased sharply, partly bolstered by the fact that film tickets were given out to work units and attendance was compulsory, with admissions rising from 47 million in 1949 to 4.15 billion in 1959. In the 17 years between the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Cultural Revolution, 603 feature films and 8,342 reels of documentaries and newsreels were produced, sponsored mostly as Communist propaganda by the government. For example, in \"Guerrilla on the Railroad\" (铁道游击队), dated 1956, the Chinese Communist Party was depicted as the primary resistance force against the Japanese in the war against invasion. Chinese filmmakers were sent to Moscow to study the Soviet socialist realism style of filmmaking. In 1956, the Beijing Film Academy was opened. One important film of this era is \"This Life of Mine\" (1950), directed by Shi Hu, which follows an old beggar reflecting on his past life as a policeman working for the various regimes since 1911. The first widescreen Chinese film was produced in 1960. Animated films using a variety of folk arts, such as papercuts, shadow plays, puppetry, and traditional paintings, also were very popular for entertaining and educating children. The most famous of these, the classic \"Havoc in Heaven\" (two parts, 1961, 4), was made by Wan Laiming of the Wan Brothers and won Outstanding Film award at the London International Film Festival.\n\nThe thawing of censorship in 1956–57 (known as the Hundred Flowers Campaign) and the early 1960s led to more indigenous Chinese films being made which were less reliant on their Soviet counterparts. During this campaign the sharpest criticisms came from the satirical comedies of Lü Ban. \"Before the New Director Arrives\" exposes the hierarchical relationships occurring between the cadres, while his next film, \"The Unfinished Comedy\" (1957), was labelled as a \"poisonous weed\" during the Anti-Rightist Movement and Lü banned was from directing for life.\"The Unfinished Comedy\" was only screened after Mao's death. Other noteworthy films produced during this period were adaptations of literary classics, such as Sang Hu's \"The New Year's Sacrifice\" (1956; adapted from a Lu Xun story) and Shui Hua's \"The Lin Family Shop\" (1959; adapted from a Mao Dun story). The most prominent filmmaker of this era was Xie Jin, whose three films in particular, \"Woman Basketball Player No. 5\" (1957), \"The Red Detachment of Women\" (1961) and \"Two Stage Sisters\" (1964), exemplify China's increased expertise at filmmaking during this time. Films made during this period are polished and exhibit high production value and elaborate sets. While Beijing and Shanghai remained the main centers of production, between 1957–60 the government built regional studios in Guangzhou, Xi'an and Chengdu to encourage representations of ethnic minorities in films. Chinese cinema began to directly address the issue of such ethnic minorities during the late 1950s and early 1960s, in films like \"Five Golden Flowers\" (1959), \"Third Sister Liu\" (1960), \"Serfs\" (1963), \"Ashima\" (1964).\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the film industry was severely restricted. Almost all previous films were banned, and only a few new ones were produced, the so-called \"revolutionary model operas\". The most notable of these was a ballet version of the revolutionary opera \"The Red Detachment of Women\", directed by Pan Wenzhan and Fu Jie in 1970. Feature film production came almost to a standstill in the early years from 1967 to 1972. Movie production revived after 1972 under the strict jurisdiction of the Gang of Four until 1976, when they were overthrown. The few films that were produced during this period, such as 1975's \"Breaking with Old Ideas\", were highly regulated in terms of plot and characterization.\n\nIn the years immediately following the Cultural Revolution, the film industry again flourished as a medium of popular entertainment. Production rose steadily, from 19 features in 1977 to 125 in 1986. Domestically produced films played to large audiences, and tickets for foreign film festivals sold quickly. The industry tried to revive crowds by making more innovative and \"exploratory\" films like their counterparts in the West.\n\nIn the 1980s the film industry fell on hard times, faced with the dual problems of competition from other forms of entertainment and concern on the part of the authorities that many of the popular thriller and martial arts films were socially unacceptable. In January 1986 the film industry was transferred from the Ministry of Culture to the newly formed Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television to bring it under \"stricter control and management\" and to \"strengthen supervision over production.\"\n\nThe end of the Cultural Revolution brought the release of \"scar dramas\", which depicted the emotional traumas left by this period. The best-known of these is probably Xie Jin's \"Hibiscus Town\" (1986), although they could be seen as late as the 1990s with Tian Zhuangzhuang's \"The Blue Kite\" (1993). In the 1980s, open criticism of certain past Communist Party policies was encouraged by Deng Xiaoping as a way to reveal the excesses of the Cultural Revolution and the earlier Anti-Rightist Campaign, also helping to legitimize Deng's new policies of \"reform and opening up.\" For instance, the Best Picture prize in the inaugural 1981 Golden Rooster Awards was given to two \"scar dramas\", \"Evening Rain\" (Wu Yonggang, Wu Yigong, 1980) and \"Legend of Tianyun Mountain\" (Xie Jin, 1980).\n\nMany scar dramas were made by members of the Fourth Generation whose own careers or lives had suffered during the events in question, while younger, Fifth Generation directors such as Tian tended to focus on less controversial subjects of the immediate present or the distant past. Official enthusiasm for scar dramas waned by the 1990s when younger filmmakers began to confront negative aspects of the Mao era. \"The Blue Kite\", though sharing a similar subject as the earlier scar dramas, was more realistic in style, and was made only through obfuscating its real script. Shown abroad, it was banned from release in mainland China, while Tian himself was banned from making any films for nearly a decade afterward. After the events of June 4, 1989 in Tiananmen Square, few if any scar dramas were released domestically in mainland China.\n\nBeginning in the mid-late 1980s, the rise of the so-called Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers brought increased popularity of Chinese cinema abroad. Most of the filmmakers who made up the Fifth Generation had graduated from the Beijing Film Academy in 1982 and included Zhang Yimou, Tian Zhuangzhuang, Chen Kaige, Zhang Junzhao and others. These graduates constituted the first group of filmmakers to graduate since the Cultural Revolution and they soon jettisoned traditional methods of storytelling and opted for a more free and unorthodox approach. After the so-called scar literature in fiction had paved the way for frank discussion, Zhang Junzhao's \"One and Eight\" (1983) and Chen Kaige's \"Yellow Earth\" (1984) in particular were taken to mark the beginnings of the Fifth Generation. The most famous of the Fifth Generation directors, Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, went on to produce celebrated works such as \"King of the Children\" (1987), \"Ju Dou\" (1989), \"Farewell My Concubine\" (1993) and \"Raise the Red Lantern\" (1991), which were not only acclaimed by Chinese cinema-goers but by the Western arthouse audience. Tian Zhuangzhuang's films, though less well known by Western viewers, were well noted by directors such as Martin Scorsese. It was during this period that Chinese cinema began reaping the rewards of international attention, including the 1988 Golden Bear for \"Red Sorghum\", the 1992 Golden Lion for \"The Story of Qiu Ju\", the 1993 Palme d'Or for \"Farewell My Concubine\", and three Best Foreign Language Film nominations from the Academy Awards. All these award-winning films starred actress Gong Li, who became the Fifth Generation's most recognizable star, especially to international audiences.\n\nDiverse in style and subject, the Fifth Generation directors' films ranged from black comedy (Huang Jianxin's \"The Black Cannon Incident\", 1985) to the esoteric (Chen Kaige's \"Life on a String\", 1991), but they share a common rejection of the socialist-realist tradition worked by earlier Chinese filmmakers in the Communist era. Other notable Fifth Generation directors include Wu Ziniu, Hu Mei, Li Shaohong and Zhou Xiaowen. Fifth Generation filmmakers reacted against the ideological purity of Cultural Revolution cinema. By relocating to regional studios, they began to explore the actuality of local culture in a somewhat documentary fashion. Instead of stories depicting heroic military struggles, the films were built out of the drama of ordinary people's daily lives. They also retained political edge, but aimed at exploring issues rather than recycling approved policy. While Cultural Revolution films used character, the younger directors favored psychological depth along the lines of European cinema. They adopted complex plots, ambiguous symbolism, and evocative imagery. Some of their bolder works with political overtones were banned by Chinese authorities.\n\nThese films came with a new style of shooting as well, directors utilized extensive color and long shots. As a result of the new films being so intricate, the films were for more educated audiences than anything. The new style was profitable for some and helped filmmakers to make strides in the business. It allowed directors to get away from reality and show their artistic sense.\n\nThe Fourth Generation also returned to prominence. Given their label after the rise of the Fifth Generation, these were directors whose careers were stalled by the Cultural Revolution and who were professionally trained prior to 1966. Wu Tianming, in particular, made outstanding contributions by helping to finance major Fifth Generation directors under the auspices of the Xi'an Film Studio (which he took over in 1983), while continuing to make films like \"Old Well\" (1986) and \"The King of Masks\" (1996).\n\nThe Fifth Generation movement ended in part after the 1989 Tiananmen Incident, although its major directors continued to produce notable works. Several of its filmmakers went into self-imposed exile: Wu Tianming moved to the United States (but later returned), Huang Jianxin left for Australia, while many others went into television-related works.\n\nIn 1987, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television issued a statement encouraging the making of movies which emphasizes \"the main melody\" (主旋律) to \"invigorate national spirit and national pride\". These \"main melody\" films (主旋律电影), still produced regularly nowadays, try to emulate the commercial mainstream by the use of Hollywood-style music and special effects.\nThey are often subsidized by the state and have free access to government and military personnel. August 1st Film Studio, the film and TV production arm of the People's Liberation Army, is a studio which produces \"main melody\" cinema. \"Main melody\" films, which often depict past military engagements or are biopics of first-generation CCP leaders, have won several Best Picture prizes at the Golden Rooster Awards. Some of the more famous \"main melody\" dramas include the ten-hour epic \"Decisive Engagement\" (大决战, 1991), directed by Cai Jiawei, Yang Guangyuan and Wei Lian; \"The Opium War\" (1997), directed by Xie Jin; and \"The Founding of a Republic\" (2009), directed by Han Sanping and Fifth Generation director Huang Jianxin.\n\nThe post-1990 era has seen what some observers term the \"return of the amateur filmmaker\" as state censorship policies after the Tiananmen Square demonstrations produced an edgy underground film movement loosely referred to as the Sixth Generation. Owing to the lack of state funding and backing, these films were shot quickly and cheaply, using materials like 16 mm film and digital video and mostly non-professional actors and actresses, producing a documentary feel, often with long takes, hand-held cameras, and ambient sound; more akin to Italian neorealism and cinéma vérité than the often lush, far more considered productions of the Fifth Generation. Unlike the Fifth Generation, the Sixth Generation brings a more individualistic, anti-romantic life-view and pays far closer attention to contemporary urban life, especially as affected by disorientation, rebellion and dissatisfaction with China's contemporary social tensions. Many were made with an extremely low budget (an example is Jia Zhangke, who shoots on digital video, and formerly on 16 mm; Wang Xiaoshuai's \"The Days\" (1993) were made for US$10,000). The title and subjects of many of these films reflect the Sixth Generation's concerns. The Sixth Generation takes an interest in marginalized individuals and the less represented fringes of society. For example, Zhang Yuan's hand-held \"Beijing Bastards\" (1993) focuses on youth punk subculture, featuring artists like Cui Jian, Dou Wei and He Yong frowned upon by many state authorities, while Jia Zhangke's debut film \"Xiao Wu\" (1997) concerns a provincial pickpocket.\n\nAs the Sixth Generation gained international exposure, many subsequent movies were joint ventures and projects with international backers, but remained quite resolutely low-key and low budget. Jia's \"Platform\" (2000) was funded in part by Takeshi Kitano's production house, while his \"Still Life\" was shot on HD video. \"Still Life\" was a surprise addition and Golden Lion winner of the 2006 Venice International Film Festival. \"Still Life\", which concerns provincial workers around the Three Gorges region, sharply contrasts with the works of Fifth Generation Chinese directors like Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige who were at the time producing \"House of Flying Daggers\" (2004) and \"The Promise\" (2005). It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals.\n\nMany Sixth Generation films have highlighted the negative attributes of China's entry into the modern capitalist market. Li Yang's \"Blind Shaft\" (2003) for example, is an account of two murderous con-men in the unregulated and notoriously dangerous mining industry of northern China. (Li refused the tag of Sixth Generation, although admitted he was not Fifth Generation). While Jia Zhangke's \"The World\" (2004) emphasizes the emptiness of globalization in the backdrop of an internationally themed amusement park.\n\nSome of the more prolific Sixth Generation directors to have emerged are Wang Xiaoshuai (\"The Days\", \"Beijing Bicycle\"), Zhang Yuan (\"Beijing Bastards\", \"East Palace West Palace\"), Jia Zhangke (\"Xiao Wu\", \"Unknown Pleasures\", \"Platform\", \"The World\"), He Jianjun (\"Postman\") and Lou Ye (\"Suzhou River\", \"Summer Palace\"). One young director who does not share most of the concerns of the Sixth Generation is Lu Chuan (\"\", 2004; \"City of Life and Death\", 2010).\n\nThere is a growing number of independent post-Sixth Generation filmmakers making films with extremely low budgets and using digital equipment. They are the so-called dGeneration (for digital). These films, like those from Sixth Generation filmmakers, are mostly made outside the Chinese film system and are shown mostly on the international film festival circuit. Ying Liang and Jian Yi are two of these dGeneration filmmakers. Ying's \"Taking Father Home\" (2005) and \"The Other Half\" (2006) are both representative of the dGeneration trends of feature film. Liu Jiayin made two dGeneration feature films, \"Oxhide\" (2004) and \"Oxhide II\" (2010), blurring the line between documentary and narrative film. \"Oxhide\", made by Liu when she was a film student, frames herself and her parents in their claustrophobic Beijing apartment in a narrative praised by critics.\n\nTwo decades of reform and commercialization have brought dramatic social changes in mainland China, reflected not only in fiction film but in a growing documentary movement. Wu Wenguang's 70-minute \"\" (1990) is now seen as one of the first works of this \"New Documentary Movement\" (NDM) in China. \"Bumming\", made between 1988 and 1990, contains interviews with five young artists eking out a living in Beijing, subject to state authorized tasks. Shot using a camcorder, the documentary ends with four of the artists moving abroad after the 1989 Tiananmen Protests. \"Dance with the Farm Workers\" (2001) is another documentary by Wu.\n\nAnother internationally acclaimed documentary is Wang Bing's nine-hour tale of deindustrialization \"\" (2003). Wang's subsequent documentaries, \"\" (2007), \"Crude Oil\" (2008), \"Man with no name\" (2009), \"Three Sisters\" (2012) and \"Feng ai\" (2013), cemented his reputation as a leading documentarist of the movement.\n\nLi Hong, the first woman in the NDM, in \"Out of Phoenix Bridge\" (1997) relates the story of four young women, who moving from rural areas to the big cities like millions of other men and women, have come to Beijing to make a living.\n\nThe New Documentary Movement in recent times has overlapped with the dGeneration filmmaking, with most documentaries being shot cheaply and independently in the digital format. Xu Xin's \"Karamay\" (2010), Zhao Liang's Behemoth, Huang Weikai's \"Disorder\" (2009), Zhao Dayong's \"Ghost Town\" (2009), Du Haibing's \"1428\" (2009), Xu Tong's \"Fortune Teller\" (2010) and Li Ning’s \"Tape\" (2010) were all shot in digital format. All had made their impact in the international documentary scene and the use of digital format allows for works of vaster lengths.\n\nWith China's liberalization in the late 1970s and its opening up to foreign markets, commercial considerations have made its impact in post-1980s filmmaking. Traditionally arthouse movies screened seldom make enough to break even. An example is Fifth Generation director Tian Zhuangzhuang's \"The Horse Thief\" (1986), a narrative film with minimal dialog on a Tibetan horse thief. The film, showcasing exotic landscapes, was well received by Chinese and some Western arthouse audiences, but did poorly at the box office.\nTian's later \"The Warrior and the Wolf\" (2010) was a similar commercial failure. Prior to these, there were examples of successful commercial films in the post-liberalization period. One was the romance film \"Romance on the Lu Mountain\" (1980), which was a success with older Chinese. The film broke the Guinness Book of Records as the longest-running film on a first run. Jet Li's cinematic debut \"Shaolin Temple\" (1982) was an instant hit at home and abroad (in Japan and the Southeast Asia, for example). Another successful commercial film was \"Murder in 405\" (405谋杀案, 1980), a murder thriller.\n\nFeng Xiaogang's \"The Dream Factory\" (1997) was heralded as a turning point in Chinese movie industry, a \"hesui pian\" (Chinese New Year-screened film) which demonstrated the viability of the commercial model in China's socialist market society. Feng has become the most successful commercial director in the post-1997 era. Almost all his films made high returns domestically while he used ethnic Chinese co-stars like Rosamund Kwan, Jacqueline Wu, Rene Liu and Shu Qi to boost his films' appeal.\n\nIn the decade following 2010, owing to the influx of Hollywood films (though the number screened each year is curtailed), Chinese domestic cinema faces mounting challenges. The industry is growing and domestic films are starting to achieve the box office impact of major Hollywood blockbusters. However, not all domestic films are successful financially. In January 2010 James Cameron's \"Avatar\" was pulled out from non-3D theaters for Hu Mei's biopic \"Confucius\", but this move led to a backlash on Hu's film. Zhang Yang's 2005 \"Sunflower\" also made little money, but his earlier, low-budget \"Spicy Love Soup\" (1997) grossed ten times its budget of ¥3 million. Likewise, the 2006 \"Crazy Stone\", a sleeper hit, was made for just 3 million HKD/US$400,000. In 2009–11, Feng's \"Aftershock\" (2009) and Jiang Wen's \"Let the Bullets Fly\" (2010) became China's highest grossing domestic films, with \"Aftershock\" earning ¥670 million (US$105 million) and \"Let the Bullets Fly\" ¥674 million (US$110 million). \"Lost in Thailand\" (2012) became the first Chinese film to reach ¥1 billion at the Chinese box office and \"Monster Hunt\" (2015) became the first to reach . As of November 2015, 5 of the top 10 highest-grossing films in China are domestic productions. On February 8, 2016, the Chinese box office set a new single-day gross record, with , beating the previous record of on July 18, 2015. Also on February 2016, \"The Mermaid\", directed by Stephen Chow, became the highest-grossing film in China, overtaking \"Monster Hunt\". It is also the first film to reach .\n\nHe Ping is a director of mostly Western-like films set in Chinese locale. His \"Swordsmen in Double Flag Town\" (1991) and \"Sun Valley\" (1995) explore narratives set in the sparse terrain of West China near the Gobi Desert. His historical drama \"Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker\" (1994) won a myriad of prizes home and abroad.\n\nRecent cinema has seen Chinese cinematographers direct some acclaimed films. Other than Zhang Yimou, Lü Yue made \"Mr. Zhao\" (1998), a black comedy film well received abroad. Gu Changwei's minimalist epic \"Peacock\" (2005), about a quiet, ordinary Chinese family with three very different siblings in the post-Cultural Revolution era, took home the Silver Bear prize for 2005 Berlin International Film Festival. Hou Yong is another cinematographer who made films (\"Jasmine Women\", 2004) and TV series. There are actors who straddle the dual roles of acting and directing. Xu Jinglei, a popular Chinese actress, has made six movies to date. Her second film \"Letter from an Unknown Woman\" (2004) landed her the San Sebastián International Film Festival Best Director award. Another popular actress and director is Zhao Wei, whose directorial debut \"So Young\" (2013) was a huge box office and critical success.\n\nThe most highly regarded Chinese actor-director is undoubtedly Jiang Wen, who has directed several critically acclaimed movies while following on his acting career. His directorial debut, \"In the Heat of the Sun\" (1994) was the first PRC film to win Best Picture at the Golden Horse Film Awards held in Taiwan. His other films, like \"Devils on the Doorstep\" (2000, Cannes Grand Prix) and \"Let the Bullets Fly\" (2010), were similarly well received. By the early 2011, \"Let the Bullets Fly\" had become the highest grossing domestic film in China's history.\n\nSince the late 1980s and progressively in the 2000s, Chinese films have enjoyed considerable box office success abroad. Formerly viewed only by cineastes, its global appeal mounted after the international box office and critical success of Ang Lee's period martial arts film \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" which won Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2000. This multi-national production increased its appeal by featuring stars from all parts of the Chinese-speaking world. It provided an introduction to Chinese cinema (and especially the wuxia genre) for many and increased the popularity of many earlier Chinese films. To date \"Crouching Tiger\" remains the most commercially successful foreign-language film in U.S. history.\n\nSimilarly, in 2002, Zhang Yimou's \"Hero\" was another international box office success. Its cast featured famous actors from the Mainland China and Hong Kong who were also known to some extent in the West, including Jet Li, Zhang Ziyi, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai. Despite criticisms by some that these two films pander somewhat to Western tastes, \"Hero\" was a phenomenal success in most of Asia and topped the U.S. box office for two weeks, making enough in the U.S. alone to cover the production costs.\n\nOther films such as \"Farewell My Concubine\", \"2046\", \"Suzhou River\", \"The Road Home\" and \"House of Flying Daggers\" were critically acclaimed around the world. The Hengdian World Studios can be seen as the \"Chinese Hollywood\", with a total area of up to 330 ha. and 13 shooting bases, including a 1:1 copy of the Forbidden City.\n\nThe successes of \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" and \"Hero\" make it difficult to demarcate the boundary between \"Mainland Chinese\" cinema and a more international-based \"Chinese-language cinema\". \"Crouching Tiger\", for example, was directed by a Taiwan-born American director (Ang Lee) who works often in Hollywood. Its pan-Chinese leads include Mainland Chinese (Zhang Ziyi), Hong Kong (Chow Yun-Fat), Taiwan (Chang Chen) and Malaysian (Michelle Yeoh) actors and actresses; the film was co-produced by an array of Chinese, American, Hong Kong, and Taiwan film companies. Likewise, Lee's Chinese-language \"Lust, Caution\" (2007) drew a crew and cast from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and includes an orchestral score by French composer Alexandre Desplat. This merging of people, resources and expertise from the three regions and the broader East Asia and the world, marks the movement of Chinese-language cinema into a domain of large scale international influence. Other examples of films in this mold include \"The Promise\" (2005), \"The Banquet\" (2006), \"Fearless\" (2006), \"The Warlords\" (2007), \"Bodyguards and Assassins\" (2009) and \"Red Cliff\" (2008-9). The ease with which ethnic Chinese actresses and actors straddle the mainland and Hong Kong has significantly increased the number of co-productions in Chinese-language cinema. Many of these films also feature South Korean or Japanese actors to appeal to their East Asian neighbours. Some artistes originating from the mainland, like Hu Jun, Zhang Ziyi, Tang Wei and Zhou Xun, obtained Hong Kong residency under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme and have acted in many Hong Kong productions.\n\nIn 2010, Chinese cinema was the third largest film industry by number of feature films produced annually. In 2013, China's gross box office was ¥21.8 billion (US$3.6 billion), the second-largest film market in the world by box office receipts. In January 2013, \"Lost in Thailand\" (2012) became the first Chinese film to reach ¥1 billion at the box office. As of May 2013, 7 of the top 10 highest-grossing films in China were domestic productions. As of 2014, around half of all tickets are sold online, with the largest ticket selling sites being Maoyan.com (82 million), Gewara.com (45 million) and Wepiao.com (28 million). In 2014, Chinese films earned ¥1.87 billion outside China. By December 2013 there were 17,000 screens in the country. By January 6, 2014, there were 18,195 screens in the country. Greater China has around 251 IMAX theaters. There were 299 cinema chains (252 rural, 47 urban), 5,813 movie theaters and 24,317 screens in the country in 2014.\n\nThe country added about 8,035 screens in 2015 (at an average of 22 new screens per day, increasing its total by about 40% to around 31,627 screens, which is about 7,373 shy of the number of screens in the United States. Chinese films accounted for 61.48% of ticket sales in 2015 (up from 54% last year) with more than 60% of ticket sales being made online. Average ticket price was down about 2.5% to $5.36 in 2015. It also witnessed 51.08% increase in admissions, with 1.26 billion people buying tickets to the cinema in 2015. Chinese films grossed overseas in 2015. During the week of the 2016 Chinese New Year, the country set a new record for the highest box office gross during one week in one territory with , overtaking the previous record of of December 26, 2015 to January 1, 2016 in the United States and Canada. Chinese films grossed () in foreign markets in 2016.\n\nAs of April 2015, the largest Chinese film company by worth was Alibaba Pictures (US$8.77 billion). Other large companies include Huayi Brothers Media (US$7.9 billion), Enlight Media (US$5.98 billion) and Bona Film Group (US$542 million). The biggest distributors by market share in 2014 were: China Film Group (32.8%), Huaxia Film (22.89%), Enlight Pictures (7.75%), Bona Film Group (5.99%), Wanda Media (5.2%), Le Vision Pictures (4.1%), Huayi Brothers (2.26%), United Exhibitor Partners (2%), Heng Ye Film Distribution (1.77%) and Beijing Anshi Yingna Entertainment (1.52%). The biggest cinema chains in 2014 by box office gross were: Wanda Cinema Line (), China Film Stellar (393.35 million), Dadi Theater Circuit (378.17 million), Shanghai United Circuit (355.07 million), Guangzhou Jinyi Zhujiang (335.39 million), China Film South Cinema Circuit (318.71 million), Zhejiang Time Cinema (190.53 million), China Film Group Digital Cinema Line (177.42 million), Hengdian Cinema Line (170.15 million) and Beijing New Film Association (163.09 million).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "597264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=597264", "title": "Crossover (fiction)", "text": "Crossover (fiction)\n\nA crossover is the placement of two or more otherwise discrete fictional characters, settings, or universes into the context of a single story. They can arise from legal agreements between the relevant copyright holders, unauthorized efforts by fans or common corporate ownership.\n\nCrossovers often occur in an official capacity in order for the intellectual property rights holders to reap the financial reward of combining two or more popular, established properties. In other cases, the crossover can serve to introduce a new concept derivative of an older one.\n\nCrossovers generally occur between properties owned by a single holder, but they can, more rarely, involve properties from different holders, provided that the inherent legal obstacles can be overcome. They may also involve using characters that have passed into the public domain with those concurrently under copyright protection.\n\nA crossover story may try to explain its own reason for the crossover, such as characters being neighbors (notable examples being the casts from \"Golden Girls\" and \"Empty Nest\") or meeting via dimensional rift or similar phenomenon (a common explanation for science fiction properties that have different owners). Some crossovers are not explained at all. Others are absurd or simply impossible within the fictional setting, and have to be ignored by the series' respective continuities. Still others intentionally make the relations between two or more fictional universes confusing, as with \"The Simpsons\" and \"Futurama\", where each show is fiction in the other.\n\nCrossovers of multiple characters owned by one company or published by one publisher, have been used to set an established continuity, where characters can frequently meet within one setting. This is especially true of comic book publishers, as different characters in various Marvel, DC or Valiant comic books frequently interact with one another since they live in a \"shared universe\". For example, in the Marvel Comics universe, Spider-Man has frequent dealings with another Marvel hero, Daredevil, just as in the DC Comics Universe, the Flash and Green Lantern often collaborate. In comic book terminology, these \"guest star\" roles are common enough that they are generally not considered crossovers; rather, this short-term collaboration to fight crime is called a team-up. A crossover in comic book terms only occurs when a story spans more than one title. This has led to \"crossover events\", in which major occurrences are shown as affecting most or all of the stories in the shared universe.\n\nThe earliest such crossover event was Gardner Fox's \"Zatanna's Search\", which took place in \"Hawkman\" #4 (October/November 1964), \"Detective Comics\" #336 (February 1965), \"The Atom\" #19 (June/July 1965), \"Green Lantern\" #42 (January 1966), \"Detective Comics\" #355 (September 1966), and \"Justice League of America\" #51 (February 1967). This story dealt with Zatanna attempting to reconnect with her father, Zatara, and seeking the aid of Hawkman, Batman, Robin, the Atom, Green Lantern, and Elongated Man along the way.\n\nThe first major crossover event was spearheaded by the Marvel Editor-in-Chief at the time, Jim Shooter. As a way to further toy sales he devised the \"Secret Wars\" crossover, which brought all the major Marvel heroes into a 12-issue miniseries to battle a common threat. After the threat was dealt with, they all returned to their regular titles. \"Secret Wars\" was hailed as both a critical and commercial success, largely because the events of the crossover had lasting effects on the characters (such as the introduction of Spider-Man's black suit which would later become the villain Venom). Jim Shooter later perfected his crossover technique at Valiant Comics with the \"Unity\" event. \"Unity\" brought all the Valiant characters together to defeat Mothergod, but was told within the existing Valiant Comics titles (and two bookend special issues). Readers were not obliged to buy all 18 chapters as the story was coherent when reading just one title, but far more layered when all were read. Like \"Secret Wars\", the \"Unity\" crossover had lasting effects on the Valiant universe; most notably the introduction of Turok, the birth of Magnus, Robot Fighter and the death of a major Valiant hero.\n\nDark Horse Comics's \"Aliens Versus Predator\" comic book franchise was a success that continued into many video games, two movies and even an \"Aliens Versus Predator Versus The Terminator\" comic.\n\nThe comic crossovers from Raj Comics are very famous in India, in which the super heroes meet to fight a common enemy. Many of these crossovers have occurred between Nagraj and Super Commando Dhruva. In \"Kohram\", all the heroes in Raj Universe meet to finish \"Haru\", an extremely powerful enemy.\n\nWebcomics creators sometimes produce crossovers; one of the first was a two-week sequence between Christopher Baldwin's \"Bruno\" and Peter Zale's \"Helen, Sweetheart of the Internet\" in 1998.\n\nIn 2013, Archie Comics released a 12-part crossover of Capcom character Mega Man and Sega character Sonic the Hedgehog called \"Worlds Collide\". Taking place in issues of the \"Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Universe\" and \"Mega Man\" comic series from Archie, the crossover involved Dr. Eggman and Dr. Wily forming an alliance to take over both their universes and destroy their respective nemeses. Sonic and Mega Man were briefly tricked into fighting each other, but later joined forces and teamed up with other heroes to battle the doctors' forces, which included virtually every Robot Master introduced in the \"Mega Man\" games. The popularity of this crossover and the books involved led to a second crossover in 2015 entitled \"Worlds Unite\", which not only reunited Sonic and Mega Man but also featured comics-exclusive characters from both of their books, the \"Mega Man X\" and \"Sonic Boom\" spinoff franchises and various other SEGA and Capcom franchises. This crossover was enabled by the conclusion of the first crossover, which saw a reboot to the Sonic books as their universe was drastically rewritten. Aftereffects of this included the Genesis Portals, gateways connecting worlds that would be exploited by \"Mega Man X\" villain Sigma and his minions, forcing a reunion between Sonic and Mega Man and an alliance between heroes of the various franchises involved. \"Worlds Unite\" spans not only the three series featured in the first crossover, but also includes the \"Sonic Boom\" comic series, which entered publication between the two crossovers.\n\nThere are also intercompany crossovers, where characters owned by two different companies meet, such as those from DC and Marvel.\n\nCartoon crossovers are not uncommon, and most of them – like comics or live-action TV shows – will often feature characters owned by the same company or network. One example is Cartoon Network's \"The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door\". It features five crossovers – \"Ed, Edd n Eddy\", \"\", \"The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy\", a reference to \"The Powerpuff Girls\" and a quote from \"Scooby-Doo\", which are all licensed Cartoon Network series. The cast of \"\" and \"Generator Rex\" team up in \"\". Similarly, characters from \"Uncle Grandpa\" and \"Steven Universe\" appeared in a crossover episode \"Say Uncle\". The same occurred with \"The Powerpuff Girls\" and \"Teen Titans Go!\" in an episode called \"TTG v PPG\". Most of the last episodes of the \"\" (a spinoff of the film \"Lilo & Stitch\") had crossovers with various other Disney cartoons, including \"The Proud Family\", \"Kim Possible\", \"Recess\", and \"American Dragon Jake Long\". The \"Jimmy Timmy Power Hour\" trilogy is another example, in which Jimmy Neutron and Timmy Turner switch universes. The Disney TV series \"Hercules\", based on the 1997 film of the same name, had an episode titled \"Hercules and the Arabian Night\" that had a crossover between the characters of the TV series and film and with the characters of the Disney film \"Aladdin\", in which Hades and Jafar each try to get rid of each other's enemies (Hades would try to defeat Aladdin while Jafar would try to defeat Hercules). Another crossover is \"Rugrats Go Wild\" in which the Rugrats are stranded on an island where The Wild Thornberrys were at the time. In Dexter's Laboratory \"Dial M for Monkey\" \"Huntor\" who tries to hunt Monkey is himself hunted; \"Huntor\" later makes a cameo crossover in Samurai Jack's \"Jack vs Mad Jack.\" \nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, crossovers were particularly common among the Hanna-Barbera properties. Some of the earliest examples happened on \"The New Scooby-Doo Movies\", which featured appearances by characters from \"Harlem Globetrotters\", \"Josie and the Pussycats\", \"Jeannie\", \"Speed Buggy\", \"Batman and Robin\", and \"The Addams Family\". Later, the \"Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10\" set of movies involved several crossovers, including such combinations as \"The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones\". This was taken to an extreme in the 1977–79 series \"Laff-A-Lympics,\" which was essentially a gathering of the Hanna-Barbera characters for a regular series.\n\nCrossovers are not necessarily composed of characters under common ownership. Two of the most notable cartoon crossovers consisted of characters from different companies. Disney's movie \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" had characters from various companies, most notably Disney and Warner Bros. Daffy Duck and Donald Duck made a simultaneous appearance in one scene, in which the two of them exchanged blows during a piano duet. Later in the movie, Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny were shown parachuting together (to keep things from getting too iffy legally, Mickey and Bugs' lines were written so that each of them said exactly the same number of words in the movie). The film also includes cameos of characters from MGM. The end of the movie features all the cartoons from all of the animation companies joining together in song, to be concluded by Porky Pig stuttering his famous \"That's All, Folks!\" line as Tinker Bell ends the scene with a magical fade-out.\n\nOn February 27, 1998, Fox Kids show, \"Power Rangers in Space\" and \"\", had their crossover with the episode \"Shell Shocked\".\n\nOn October 4, 1997, The 2 Kids WB shows, \"Superman: The Animated Series\" and \"The New Batman Adventures\", had their first crossover with the TV movie \"World's Finest\", which was also released on DVD.\n\nAnother cartoon crossover would occur in 1990, \"Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue\". This cartoon featured popular characters from children's Saturday morning cartoons, banding together to promote an anti-drug message. ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC aired this half-hour special one Saturday morning with characters from all their networks, including Huey, Dewey, and Louie (from Disney's \"DuckTales\"), Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Slimer (from \"The Real Ghostbusters\" and \"Extreme Ghostbusters\"), Michelangelo (from \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\"), Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Alvin and the Chipmunks, The Smurfs, ALF (from ), Garfield, and the trio of Baby Kermit, Baby Piggy, and Baby Gonzo (from Jim Henson's \"Muppet Babies\"). Animation companies granted unlimited, royalty-free use of their cartoon characters for this project, a feat that has been unequalled before or since then. This cartoon was also introduced by then-President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush, and would be distributed to schools and video stores free of charge nationwide.\n\nManga artist Leiji Matsumoto has been known to cross over the characters of his various stories and characters such as \"Captain Harlock\", \"Galaxy Express 999\", and \"Queen Millennia\", all of which were originally written as separate, self-contained stories. In the \"Maetel Legend\", Queen Promethium is revealed to be having been Yukino Yaoi, the protagonist from \"Queen Millennia\". Matsumoto has also created various crossovers with \"Space Battleship Yamato\", an anime on which he served as director, although the rights to Yamato are actually owned by Yoshinobu Nishizaki.\n\nThe adult parody-oriented series \"Drawn Together\" features many crossovers; while some are regular cameos, such as Peter and Lois Griffin from \"Family Guy\", others involve a personality twist, such as the homicidal version of Bambi from the eponymous film or the gay version of Elmer Fudd from the \"Looney Tunes\" franchise.\n\nThe Disney/Marvel crossover \"\" features the Marvel heroes Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk, and Thor, the Marvel villains Whiplash, MODOK, Red Skull, and Venom, and characters from \"Phineas and Ferb\", where the storyline involves Phineas and Ferb trying to restore power to the Marvel heroes, whose powers were taken away by Doofenshmirtz.\n\nDuring its 26th season, \"The Simpsons\" has crossovers with \"Family Guy\" and \"Futurama\". In the hour-long \"Family Guy\" season 13 premiere \"The Simpsons Guy\", the Griffins meet the Simpson family, who meet the Planet Express crew in the \"Simpsons\" episode \"Simpsorama\".\n\nIn the Disney series \"House of Mouse\", Mickey Mouse and friends host a nightclub featuring cameos by other Disney characters.\n\nWebtoons (animated shows from the internet) can also have crossovers with different webtoons, franchises, YouTubers and more. Some examples are when Kate from TomSka's \"Crash Zoom\" series makes an appearance in \"Eddsworld\" as a trick or treater who possesses Matt and Edd in the episode, \"Trick or Threat\". In addition to this a couple of characters from \"Eddsworld\" make appearances in some \"Crash Zoom\" episodes such as \"Orcs and Dorks\". Another example is \"Death Battle\" which is a show where two guys (Whiz and Boomstick) put two characters from different franchises together to battle each other. These characters range from television, movie, video game, or comic franchises. Shows like \"One Minute Melee\", \"Cartoon Fight Club\", and \"Death Battle Exhibitions\" (the spinoff series) have a similar format to \"Death Battle\".\n\n\"Konami\" made the first crossover video game featuring Simon Belmont from \"Castlevania\", \"Universal\" Picture's \"King Kong\" and Mikey from the Warner Bros. Movie \"The Goonies\" in \"Konami Wai Wai World\" for the Famicom in 1988. \"The King of Fighters\", \"Marvel vs. Capcom\", and many other franchises from third-party developers such as Capcom and SNK bring these licenses together.\n\nThe 2.5D fighting game series \"Super Smash Bros.\" brings various Nintendo characters together and allows players to fight against each other as these characters in arenas. The third game in the series, \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" introduced two third-party characters with the inclusion of Solid Snake and Sonic the Hedgehog, of Konami's \"Metal Gear\" series and Sega's \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series respectively. The fourth and fifth installments, \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS\" and \"Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\", feature characters from the third-party franchises of Capcom's \"Mega Man\" and \"Street Fighter\", Sega's \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" and \"Bayonetta\", Bandai Namco's \"Pac-Man\", and Square Enix's \"Final Fantasy\", in addition to other Nintendo characters from the company's different universes.\n\nThe Namco-developed \"Soul\" series features characters from outside Namco's titles (Link from Nintendo's \"The Legend of Zelda\" series, Heihachi Mishima from \"Tekken\", Todd McFarlane's Spawn, \"Star Wars's\" Darth Vader, Yoda and Starkiller, Lloyd Irving from \"Tales of Symphonia\", and Ubisoft Montreal's Ezio Auditore from the \"Assassin's Creed\" series.\n\n\"Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games\", released in Japan two months before \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", was the first time that Mario and Sonic (as well as their associated characters) appeared in a game together.\n\nIn the RPG \"Kingdom Hearts\", Disney and \"Final Fantasy\" characters join forces.\n\n\"Super Robot Wars\" are turn-based strategy games featuring a variety of Japanese mecha series from many generations, such as \"Mazinger Z\", \"Gundam\", \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", and \"GaoGaiGar\".\n\nMore recently, there has been a collaboration between Capcom and Namco, which results in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\" and the upcoming \"Tekken X Street Fighter\".\n\nWarriors Orochi is the game that crossover about \"Dynasty Warriors\" and \"Samurai Warriors\".\n\nThe Disney film \"Wreck-It Ralph\" features many video game character cameo appearances.\n\nPerhaps one of the most notable video game crossovers is \"Lego Dimensions\", which makes use of over 30 different franchises, including DC Comics, \"Doctor Who\", \"The Lego Movie\", \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"Sonic the Hedgehog\", and more.\n\nThe first film crossover in a series of Universal Studios monster films was \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\", in 1943. In 2003, \"Freddy vs. Jason\" was released by New Line Cinema. In 2004, 20th Century Fox released \"Alien vs. Predator\" along with the sequel \"\" in 2007. One year later, both Dollman vs. Demonic Toys and \"Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys\" were released by 20th Century Fox and Terry Kelley Studios. In 2015, Sony released \"Lake Placid vs. Anaconda\".\n\nAfter the comics publishing house Marvel Comics ventured into movie production, they set of to produce solitary films with popular superheroes from the Avengers team, with characters from upcoming films making cameo appearances in films starring another superhero, while it all lead to the crossover movie \"The Avengers\" (2012). The same process was repeated for \"\" (2015) and \"\" (2018) and all the movies together form the crossover film series referred to as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Inspired by Marvel's success, Warner Bros., who hold movie rights for DC Comics' heroes, announced the production of \"\" (2016) and further plans to develop the cinematic DC Extended Universe, while Paramount Pictures and Allspark Pictures announced plans to create a cinematic universe on the Transformers film series.\n\nThere have been numerous crossovers in Japanese cinema. The boom of kaiju films saw a lot of crossovers produced at Toho Studios, with some of the monsters forming teams in numerous movies, much like the Marvel movie franchise. Godzilla, Mothra and Rodan (Radon) each first appeared in standalone films before being set against each other or even teaming up against stronger enemies. Their first encounter was in 1964, first in \"Mothra vs. Godzilla\" and a few months later of all three in \"Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster\". In 1962 Toho released \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\". The long running Zatoichi series sees Shintaro Katsu's blind master swordsman face of with Toshiro Mifune in his iconic role in \"Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo\" (1970) and also features a unique cross-Asian project \"Zatoichi and the One-Armed Swordsman\" (1971). This coproduction sees Jimmy Wang reprise his famous part of the \"One-Armed Swordsman\" while featuring two different endings for both the Japanese and Hong Kong audiences.\n\nIn literature, some authors also engage in crossovers by including characters from different novels they have written in one. Kim Newman is another author who frequently uses this device, as does Stephen King. The works of James Branch Cabell, J.D. Salinger, William Faulkner, Margaret Laurence, Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut, Mordecai Richler, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov also cross over with each other, linking different characters and settings together over a number of different works. Author Rick Riordan publishes multiple book series featuring gods of ancient civilizations in the modern day, which have had two crossovers and three references to other series. The first popular crossover in literature was the 1885 Mark Twain novel, \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\", which had an important guest appearance by Tom Sawyer.\n\nBrazilian writer Monteiro Lobato also created solid and imaginative crossovers, using elements and characters from Brazilian folklore such as the Cuca and Saci, from Greek mythology, from the \"Arabian Nights\", from fairy tales such as Grimm's \"Snow White\", Western literature such as Peter Pan, cartoons such as \"Popeye\" and \"Felix the Cat\", and Western films.\n\nIt is also common for authors to 'crossover' characters who have passed into the public domain, and thus do not require copyright or royalty payments for their use in other works. \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill is another example of this, as all of the main characters and most of the secondary / background characters are fictional characters whose copyright has expired, and all are characters of different authors and creators brought together within one massive extended universe. Many of the works of Philip José Farmer's Wold Newton family sequences (which has also been explored and developed by other authors) also utilize and interweave numerous otherwise unrelated fictional characters into a rich family history by speculating familial connections between them (such as a blood-relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Tarzan). Roger Zelazny's novel \"A Night in the Lonesome October\" combines Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Frankenstein, Jack the Ripper, and the Cthulhu Mythos, although he never specifically identifies them as such (\"The Count\", \"The Good Doctor\", \"Jack\", etc.).\n\nOccasionally, authors will include into crossovers classic fictional characters whose copyright is still held by the original authors (or at least their estates), but who are nevertheless considered iconic or 'mythic' enough to be recognised from a few character traits or descriptions without being directly named (thus not requiring royalties payments to be made to the copyright holder). A prominent example occurs within \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One\", wherein a character who is clearly intended in appearance and description by other characters to be Dr. Fu Manchu appears as a significant villain; however, as this character was not in the public domain at the time of writing and the rights still held by the estate of his creator Sax Rohmer, he is not directly named as such in the work and is only referred to as 'the Devil Doctor'. Something similar occurs in \"\", wherein a character named \"Jimmy\" is clearly intended to be Ian Fleming's character James Bond, though here he is satirized as being an inept and unfavorable antagonist, likely to parody Sean Connery's appearance in the 2003 film adaptation. Another example in \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" is when a character is named to be the Anti-Christ, yet, despite never being named, is shown to be an evil Harry Potter.\n\nThe TV show \"Once Upon a Time\" is set in a world in which all fairy tales coexist, including Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, and even Alice in Wonderland. (As a production of The Walt Disney Company, copyrighted elements from that company's productions have appeared in \"Once Upon a Time\".) The \"Shrek\" film series is built on the same concept, and even includes references to then-copyrighted elements like Peter Pan (often in the form of satire).\n\nOne of the earlier instances of crossovers in TV productions outside the US is the episode \"Unter Brüdern\" (1990), which was produced by WDR and DFF as a crossover between the West German crime series \"Tatort\" and the East German crime series \"Polizeiruf 110\". Their respective popular heroes Horst Schimanski and Peter Fuchs join forces to solve a case in the turmoil of the time after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The episode was produced during the short transition period between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany. \n\nCrossovers involving principals can also occur when the characters have no prior relationship, but are related by time period, locale or profession. The \"Law and Order\" series, for example, afford a commonality of setting and profession which lends itself to crossovers, both within the franchise and in a wider universe. \"Law & Order: SVU\" has crossed over several times with \"Chicago P.D.\" and \"Chicago Fire\", as well as sharing a common character with \"Homicide: Life on the Street\". \"NCIS\" has crossed over with \"NCIS: Los Angeles\", \"NCIS: New Orleans\" and \"JAG\", while \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" has crossed over with both \"Scorpion\" and \"Hawaii Five-0\". Following the cancellation of the ABC soap opera \"One Life to Live\" and its high rated finale, several characters crossed over into the network's remaining soap opera \"General Hospital\", remaining in the same timeline as their former show.\n\nThe \"CSI\" franchise is another common example of the crossover phenomena, with the original series crossing over with \"CSI: Miami\", \"CSI: Cyber\", \"CSI: NY\" and \"Without a Trace\". \"CSI: NY\" crossed over with fellow CBS series \"Cold Case\", and Ted Danson appeared as a regular on both \"CSI\" and \"Cyber\". Similarly, \"Family Guy\" has crossed over with \"The Simpsons\", while \"The Simpsons\" has crossed over with \"The X-Files\". \"The X-Files\" has in turn crossed over with \"Millennium\", \"\", \"The Lone Gunmen\" and \"Cops\". A proposed crossover with \"The West Wing\" was planned, but was never produced.\n\nThere was also an ongoing use of crossover characters between \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", \"Green Acres\", and \"Petticoat Junction\".\n\nThough most common on shows of the same production company (see, for example, \"Hurricane Saturday\"), crossovers have also occurred because shows share the same distributor or television network. A notable example of this kind of link is that between \"Murder, She Wrote\" and \"Magnum, P.I.\" These shows were made by different companies, but owned by Universal Studios and broadcast on CBS. Another case is that of \"Mad About You\" and \"Friends\", which share the character of Ursula Buffay. Neither show shares any production or distribution commonality, but rather an actress (Lisa Kudrow), a setting (New York City) and a schedule (\"Friends\" initially followed \"Mad About You\" on NBC's Thursday night schedule).\n\n\"Mad About You\" and \"Friends\" share another type of \"network crossover\". On rare occasions, networks have chosen to theme an entire night's programming around a crossover \"event\". In one case, a New York City blackout caused by Paul Reiser's character on \"Mad About You\" was experienced by the characters on \"Friends\" and \"Madman of the People\". Such \"event nights\" can also be linked by a single character's quest across multiple shows on the same evening. ABC attempted this kind of \"event night\" crossover with its Friday night programming during the 1997 season. There, they proposed that the title character of \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" should chase her cat, Salem, through \"Boy Meets World\", \"You Wish\" and \"Teen Angel\" because it had run away with a \"time ball\" that was displacing each show through time.\n\nABC also attempted a \"crossover\" when four of its sitcoms (\"Grace Under Fire\", \"Ellen\", \"The Drew Carey Show\" and \"Coach\") all went to Las Vegas during the 1996–1997 season.\n\nDan Schneider used the show he was producing \"Zoey 101\" to promote his new show \"iCarly\" by making characters from \"Zoey 101\" go to \"ICarly.com\" or use the song \"Leave It All To Me\", the iCarly theme song, as a ringtone. A \"Henry Danger\" comic book and Gibby's wax head is seen in the \"Game Shakers\" episode \"Lost Jacket, Falling Pigeons\", the subway station's lost and found.\n\nOn other occasions, crossovers between established shows can occur without a network or production commonality, but simply because there is some narrative rationale for the crossover. The appearance of detective John Munch (from NBC's \"\") on Fox's \"The X-Files\" happened merely because the episode revolved around a crime scene in Baltimore, a logical place for characters on \"The X-Files\" to have encountered Munch. Munch would also appear on the TV series \"Law & Order\" on NBC in which it had one episode which began on that series in New York City and concluded in Baltimore on \"Homicide: Life on the Street\". Later, when \"Homicide\" went off the air in 1999, Detective Munch ends up leaving Baltimore to move to New York, and becoming a permanent character (as New York City Detective Munch) on NBC's \"\" until October 2013.\n\nA two-part crossover episode between \"\" with \"Without a Trace\" aired on November 8, 2007. The first hour was on \"CSI\" and the second hour was on \"Without a Trace\". While both series are on the same network in the United States, spreading two parts of a story across two different shows can cause problems in international markets where they have been separately sold to different broadcasters. For example, in the United Kingdom, \"Without a Trace\" was shown on Channel 4 and \"CSI\" on Channel 5, meaning the two companies had to come to a special agreement to show both episodes. Another \"CSI\" crossover occurred in 2009 when Raymond Langston from \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" appeared both in \"\" and \"\", traveling to Miami and New York to track a human trafficking and organ harvesting ring. \"ER\" had a crossover with \"Third Watch\" which corresponded with a peak in viewership for the latter show, with 17.2 million viewers.\n\nIn 2013, the Canadian crime drama series \"Republic of Doyle\" and \"Murdoch Mysteries\" produced a crossover, which was complicated by the shows' incompatible historical settings; \"Murdoch Mysteries\" is a historical series set in the 1890s, while \"Republic of Doyle\" is set in the present day. The problem was solved by having the actors cross over as \"relatives\" of their primary characters; Allan Hawco appeared on the November 25, 2013 episode of \"Murdoch Mysteries\" as Jacob Doyle, a 19th-century ancestor of his regular character Jake Doyle, while Yannick Bisson appeared on a January 2014 episode of \"Republic of Doyle\" as Bill Murdoch, a 21st-century descendant of his regular character William Murdoch.\n\nDisney Channel's \"Suite Life\" franchise has featured three crossovers: In 2006, \"That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana\" featured characters from \"Hannah Montana\" and \"That's So Raven\" taking a vacation at the Tipton Hotel (the main setting of \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\"); Hannah Montana/Miley Stewart (Miley Cyrus) also eats cake off Zack, which recurs in the 2009 crossover \"Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana\", in which characters from \"Wizards of Waverly Place\" and \"Hannah Montana\" come on aboard the S.S. Tipton. In 2015 a crossover between two Disney XD shows \"\" and \"Mighty Med\" crossed over in the special \"Lab Rats vs. Mighty Med\".\n\nAnother type of crossover involves characters from an off the air series resurfacing in a newer series. This occurred in a 2010 episode of the Nickelodeon sitcom \"iCarly\"; the episode \"iStart a Fan War\" featured recurring characters from two Nickelodeon series: \"Drake & Josh\" characters Eric Blonowitz, Craig Ramirez, Gavin Mitchell, and \"Zoey 101\" character Stacey Dillsen. A crossover between \"Victorious\" and \"Drake & Josh\" also occurred, with Helen DuBois, portrayed by Yvette Nicole Brown making an appearance. An episode titled \"iParty with Victorious\" was a crossover between \"iCarly\" and \"Victorious\". This means all 4 shows exist in the same universe. However, in \"Who Did It to Trina\", Tori referred to \"Drake and Josh\" as a TV show, making it seem as if the previous appearance was an actor of a character from a show within a show. Also in multiple episodes from \"iCarly\" and \"Sam & Cat\" (a crossover/spin-off of \"iCarly\" And \"Victorious\") one can see \"Drake and Josh\" and \"Zoey 101\" in TV guides, when the characters are watching TV. Carly and Spencer were heard watching it in the \"iCarly\" episode \"iGet Pranky\" and Carly is seen looking at it briefly in \"iToe Fat Cakes\" and you can see the character Megan from \"Drake and Josh\" (also portrayed by Miranda Cosgrove) and Sam is seen changing the channel to it in \"#FavoriteShow\" an episode from \"Sam & Cat\", making the universe between each of the shows confusing. However, these were probably all non-canonical references.\n\nIn 2014, \"The Thundermans\" and \"The Haunted Hathaways\" did a crossover, called \"The Haunted Thundermans\". In 2016, \"Henry Danger\" and \"The Thundermans\" did a crossover, called \"Danger & Thunder\". In 2017, \"Henry Danger\" and \"Game Shakers\" did a crossover, called \"Danger Games\", which was then followed by a crossover episode, called \"Babe Loves Danger\", that aired in 2018. In 2017, \"Game Shakers\" did a crossover with \"iCarly\", called \"Game Shippers\".\n\nThe main characters of \"Aaahh!!! Real Monsters\" make a crossover appearance in the \"Rugrats\" episode, \"Ghost Story\". This is because both shows were created/produced by Klasky Csupo and distributed also by Nickelodeon.\n\nIn Chile, children's programs and characters from El Mundo del Profesor Rossa (Spanish for \"The World of Professor Rossa\") and Cachureos (Chilean Spanish for \"odds and ends\") conducted a crossover between them for a few minutes in their emissions of Saturday 18 (Mundo del Profesor Rossa) and Sunday 19 (Cachureos) of April 1998 due the debut of the latter program on Canal 13, after several years of broadcast on TVN and even have competed with each other for the child audience.\n\nCrossovers can take the form of a promotional cameo appearance, used to draw attention to another work of fiction, with little rational explanation in the context of the hosting show's narrative. When not clearly presented as parody, this is frequently scorned by fans as blatant commercialism. A notable example of this is \"The Simpsons\" episode \"A Star Is Burns\", in which the character of Jay Sherman (from \"The Critic\") appeared. It originally aired on March 5, 1995 on FOX right before \"The Critic\" began its second season, its first season having aired on ABC. This episode was largely condemned by fans of \"The Simpsons\" as existing to promote \"The Critic\", an animated series considered inferior by comparison. Even \"Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening objected, preferring to remove his name from the credits of that particular episode in protest.\n\nThe character Dan Tanna (played by Robert Urich) from the detective series \"Vega$\" appeared in an episode of \"Charlie's Angels\" (\"Angels in Vegas\") one week prior to the debut of \"Vega$\". However, it is not considered a spin-off because Dan Tanna was introduced in the pilot that was aired as an \"ABC TV Movie of the Week\" on the evening of Tuesday, April 25, 1978. The crossover was simply used to reintroduce the Dan Tanna character and to promote the debut of \"Vega$\" as an ongoing series. Additionally, the cast of \"The Love Boat\" appeared in the fourth season premier of \"Charlie's Angels\" (\"Love Boat Angels\").\n\nIn 2010, as a nod to the 50th anniversary of \"Coronation Street\", characters in fellow established TV soap \"EastEnders\" made reference to watching the special anniversary episode. EastEnders had celebrated its own 25th anniversary earlier in the same year.\n\nThe two CBS Daytime game shows (\"The Price Is Right\" and \"Let's Make a Deal\") are used for promotional cameos from other CBS properties. Promotional cameos from the two daytime dramas, primetime shows (including primetime airings), and sports properties are common. \"Price\" has been used to promote anniversaries of CBS daytime dramas, the \"NCIS\" franchise, the three reality shows, and CBS Sports' coverage of the NFL.\n\nIn its simplest and most common form, a television crossover involves a starring character on a parent show appearing on a spin-off or vice versa because of established character relationships. An obvious example of this type of crossover occurred when Cliff Huxtable of \"The Cosby Show\" visited his daughter, Denise, on \"A Different World\". Another example of this is \"The Bionic Woman\", which was a spin-off from \"The Six Million Dollar Man\". Jaime Sommers was a tennis pro who was nearly killed in a skydiving accident, but her life was saved by Oscar Goldman (Richard Anderson) and Dr. Rudy Wells (Martin E. Brooks) who surgically implanted her with bionic parts similar to those of Steve Austin. Steve Austin and Jaimie Sommers often crossovered, while the characters Oscar Goldman and Rudy Wells appeared regularly in both shows. Another example would be the appearances made by \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" characters to \"Angel\" in Los Angeles from Sunnydale; in a striking example, \"Fool for Love\" and \"Darla\", shown on the same night, contain overlapping flashbacks as remembered by Spike and Darla respectively. There is also \"Frasier\", which features characters from the first show, \"Cheers\". Similarly, \"Dallas\" characters J. R. Ewing, Bobby Ewing, Lucy Ewing and Kristin Shepard all appeared in its spin-off \"Knots Landing\" while \"Knots Landing\" characters Gary Ewing and Valene Ewing each made several appearances on \"Dallas\" after \"Knots Landing\" premiered.\n\nMore complex multi-production franchises can utilize crossovers of characters to serve as a device in establishing continuity in a shared fictional universe. This crossover is common in the \"Star Trek\" universe, where minor guest stars from one series have appeared as featured guest stars later ones. A good example of this crossover is that of the Klingons Kor (from the \"\" episode \"Errand of Mercy\"), Koloth (from \"The Trouble With Tribbles\") and Kang (from \"Day of the Dove\"). After the passage of about a century of narrative time, the three onetime adversaries of Captain Kirk appeared together in the \"\" episode, \"Blood Oath\" – as the Klingons and Federation had become allies in the century between, the former villains are now portrayed as heroes. Another Klingon, Arne Darvin, appeared as a secondary character in \"The Trouble with Tribbles\", but was the principal villain of DS9's \"Trials and Tribble-ations\". Intended as a celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary, \"Trials and Tribble-ations\" was actually a crossover in and of itself; using then brand-new bluescreen techniques, the episode places the DS9 cast (after hijacking the \"Defiant\", Darvin had gone back in time hoping to kill Kirk and become a hero to the Klingons, and it's up to Sisko and his comrades to stop Darvin and preserve the timeline) inside the TOS episode, interacting with James T. Kirk, Spock and the rest of the \"Enterprise\" crew.\n\nThe distinction between \"spin-off\" and \"crossover\" is sometimes narrow. The two terms can become especially conflated if two shows are linked by a guest star with a single appearance. There is debate, for instance over whether \"Out of the Blue\" is a spin-off of \"Happy Days\", or whether the star of \"Out of the Blue\" merely crossed over into \"Happy Days\".\n\n\"\", a spinoff of \"\", featured a guest appearance by Rikki Chadwick, a main character from the former series, in its final two episodes, thus confirming that the spin off-acts as a sequel rather than a prequel or alternative storyline as many fans suspected.\n\nOften, the problems of bringing together two shows with different narrative ambitions make the writing of a crossover burdensome. Such difficulties are encountered by situation comedies that wish to crossover with dramatic television programs. The satirical crossover—ranging in length from a cameo to a full comedy sketch or episode—is an extremely popular way of circumventing this problem. By various means, such crossovers typically avoid outcry from fans by being obvious parody or homage. However, on rare occasion, the humor of such crossovers can be used by one show make a narrative point by capitalizing on the audience's experience of the other program.\n\nSuch tongue-in-cheek crossovers typically fall into one of several broad categories.\n\nSometimes, crossovers occur even when there was no explicit intent to create them. Viewer interpretation can play into the size and complexity of crossovers. These sorts of crossovers involve no creation of additional material, but merely result from inferences drawn about existing filmed episodes. Usually they are a product of narrative ambiguity. Perhaps the best example of this was caused by the unusual ending to \"St. Elsewhere\". One interpretation of the ending scene of the final episode has been that the entire run of the program was a figment of autistic character Tommy Westphall's imagination. This leads itself to a broad interpretation of the events of that series. Because the show had direct crossovers with twelve different programmes, and each one of these twelve had numerous \"other\" crossovers, linkages can be found from \"Elsewhere\" to 280 other shows, comprising what has been called \"the Tommy Westphall Universe\".\n\nIn contrast with legal crossovers, unofficial crossovers are created solely because of the artistic pleasure derived by its producers. Generally, unofficial crossovers take the form of fan-written fiction and fan art, but it is increasingly prevalent in amateur films and audio. Whereas official crossovers are frequently stymied by such concerns as copyright, royalties payments, quality of writing and ownership of the characters, unofficial crossovers are unfettered by such concerns, so long as property holders do not exercise their right to enjoin the distribution of such material.\n\nA good example would be the unauthorised live action fan film \"\", which brings together the properties of \"Batman\", \"Alien\" and \"Predator\" in one setting.\n\nUnofficial crossovers can also occur in a \"what-if\" scenario. Roger makes frequent cameo appearances in \"Family Guy\", while Brian makes cameos on \"American Dad!\". Roger, Rallo Tubbs, and Klaus Heissler were seen in the final \"Family Guy\" \"Star Wars\" spoof, \"It's A Trap!\", as an Imperial Officer, Nien Nunb, and Admiral Ackbar, respectively. Stewie also appears as an interactive hallucination of Booth on \"Bones\" when the agent has issues over possibly becoming a sperm donor, with David Boreanaz (who plays Booth) repaying the favor in \"Road to the North Pole\".\nAn appearance by Elmo, from Sesame Street, was made, in a hallucination of Connie Ray's, on TV sitcom The Torkelsons.\nFan fiction fusions between different science fiction movies and series are often created, such as \"Star Wars\" vs. \"Star Trek\" or \"Babylon 5\" vs. \"Stargate\". \"M.U.G.E.N.\" is a fighting game engine that features many fan-created and fictional characters and stages from various television series, movies, as well as other video games.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24957841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24957841", "title": "DARPA Network Challenge", "text": "DARPA Network Challenge\n\nThe 2009 DARPA Network Challenge was a prize competition for exploring the roles the Internet and social networking play in the real-time communications, wide-area collaborations, and practical actions required to solve broad-scope, time-critical problems. The competition was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a research organization of the United States Department of Defense. The challenge was designed to help the military generate ideas for operating under a range of circumstances, such as natural disasters. Congress authorized DARPA to award cash prizes to further DARPA's mission to sponsor revolutionary, high-payoff research that bridges the gap between fundamental discoveries and their use for national security.\n\nIn the competition, teams had to locate ten red balloons placed around the United States and then report their findings to DARPA. Due to the distributed nature of the contest, many teams used online resources, such as social media sites, to gather information or to recruit people that would look for balloons. Teams often had to deal with false submissions, and so they needed to come up with ways to validate and confirm reported sightings. The contest was concluded in under nine hours, much less than expected by DARPA, and had many implications with regards to the power of online social networking and crowdsourcing in general.\n\nUnder the rules of the competition, the $40,000 challenge award would be granted to the first team to submit the locations of 10 moored, 8-foot, red weather balloons at 10 previously undisclosed fixed locations in the continental United States. The balloons were to be placed in readily accessible locations visible from nearby roads. The balloons were deployed at 10:00 AM Eastern Time on December 5, 2009, and scheduled to be taken down at 5:00 PM. DARPA was prepared to deploy them for a second day and wait for up to a week for a team to find all of the balloons.\n\nPart of the purpose of the challenge was to force participants to discern actual pertinent information from potential noise. Many teams came across false reports of sightings, both accidental and purposeful. One valid strategy was spamming social networks with false reports to throw competitors off the trail of real sightings. The verification of balloon sightings was paramount to success.\n\nThe contest was announced only about a month before the start date. This limited the amount of time teams had to prepare. The ability of many to do so showed the effectiveness of mass and social media to distribute information and organize people quickly. The time in which information about the challenge spread was actually more compressed than a month. However, in the week preceding the launch day the official competition site increased in traffic from an average of 1,000 hits per day to 20,000 hits per day. Similarly, the efforts of many competing teams went viral in the last few days before the start date.\n\nDARPA selected the date of the competition to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Internet.\n\nEven though DARPA was prepared to deploy the balloons for a second day and accept submissions for up to a week until a team found all 10 balloons, the MIT Red Balloon Challenge Team won the competition in under 9 hours. A team from the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), which located nine balloons, won second place. Two other teams found eight balloons, five found seven, and the iSchools team (which represented Pennsylvania State University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Pittsburgh, Syracuse University, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), whose strategy is described below, finished tenth with six balloons. In table form, the top ten teams were:\n\nThe winning MIT team used a technique similar to multi-level marketing to recruit participants, with the prize money to be distributed up the chain of participants leading to successful balloon spottings, and all prize income remaining after distribution to participants to be given to charity. The team's strategy for public collaboration in finding the balloons was explained on their website:\n\nThe strategy was a variant of the Query Incentive Network model of Kleinberg and Raghavan, with the main difference being that the incentive rewards in the team's technique scale down for later participants. The recursive nature of the reward had two beneficial effects. First, participants had an incentive to involve others, as these new people would not become competitors for the reward but rather cooperating partners. Second, people not located in the United States were motivated to participate by passing along information even though they had no way of locating a balloon in person. This helped the team garner a large number (over 5,000) of participants. The team only began with four initial participants.\n\nTo determine whether submissions were legitimate or fake, the team employed at least three strategies. The first strategy was examining whether there were multiple submissions for a location. If this was the case, then the likelihood of a balloon actually being there was thought to be higher. A second strategy was to check whether the IP address of the submitter matched the supposed location of the balloon. A third strategy was to examine photos accompanying the submission. Real photos included a DARPA employee and a DARPA banner, details which were not announced, while faked ones did not.\n\nA detailed analysis of the winning strategy highlighted the important role that social media played. Analysis of Twitter data showed that while some teams relied on large initial bursts of activity over Twitter, mentions of those teams quickly faded. It was argued that due to the recursive incentive structure, the MIT team was able to create a more sustained social media impact than most teams.\n\nThe second-place GTRI team used a strategy that relied heavily on Internet publicity and social media. They created a Web site three weeks before the launch day and used a variety of media-related efforts, including a Facebook group, in order to increase the visibility of the team and increase the chance that people who spotted the balloons would report the sightings to them.\n\nThe team promised to donate all winnings to charity to appeal to the altruism of participants. However, due to the lack of a structure that created much incentive as the winning MIT team's scheme, their network of participants grew to only about 1,400 people.\n\nWith regards to validating submissions, the team assumed that because of the charitable nature of their effort, the number of false submissions would be low. In any case, they primarily relied on personal validation, having phone conversations with submitters.\n\nThe tenth-place iSchools team, which represented five universities, tried two distinct approaches. The first was directly recruiting team members to look for the balloons on launch day. These members included students, faculty, and alumni on official mailing lists and social media website groups for organizations on the team (e.g., Pennsylvania State University). Only a few of these observers actually participated, however, and only one balloon was found using this strategy.\n\nThe second strategy was using open-source intelligence methods to do cyberspace searching for results related to the challenge. This was the main source of their success in locating balloons. This strategy, in turn, consisted of two distinct sub-strategies. The first was to use a group of human analysts who would manually search online on a variety of information sources, including Twitter and the websites of competing teams, compile reported sightings, and then evaluate the validity of sightings based on the reputation of the sources.\n\nAnother strategy relating to cyberspace searching that the team used was an automated Web crawler which captured data from Twitter and opposing teams' websites and then analyzed it. This technology worked slowly and would have benefited from a longer contest duration, but the Twitter crawler proved to be especially useful because tweets sometimes contained geographic information.\n\nTo confirm the validity of possible sightings, recruited team members were used when possible. If none were available, new observers were recruited from organizations located near the sighting. The distributed location of the different organizations in the team allowed this to be a feasible strategy. Photographic analysis was used to confirm or dispute the validity of claims.\n\nThe team also encountered a case of another team accidentally leaking information about a sighting and then trying to cover it up. The iSchools team used a variety of information sources, including social networks, to determine what the real location was. This demonstrated the possibility of using information from a wide variety of public websites to determine the validity of something.\n\nPrior to the competition numerous people had discussed possible strategies, including satellite photography, aerial photography and crowdsourcing to detect balloons, as well as the possibility of misinformation campaigns to stop other teams from winning. In the actual competition, there was a variety of strategies employed by teams.\n\nOne team leader, Jason Brindel of San Rafael, California, organized a team of around 140 people. His plan was to create a web site and Twitter account dedicated to the challenge that would allow his team members to communicate their findings. Anyone participating in the challenge would be allowed to submit information, provided that they included details confirming about their submission. Brindel planned to have the team scour the Internet for mentions of balloons across news sites, blogs, and social media sites.\n\nGeorge Hotz, a Twitter celebrity now famous for hacking the PlayStation 3 and settling a suit by Sony, only prepared for the competition for an hour before posting a tweet an hour before the start of the competition. Hotz was able to locate 8 balloons successfully. Four were found within his Twitter network of almost 50,000 followers, and four were acquired through trades of information with other teams.\n\nThe fifth-place finisher, the Groundspeak Geocachers, deployed active geocachers and Groundspeak employees to search for balloons. They were successful in finding eight balloons, but due to a data entry error, were only credited with seven.\n\nA team calling themselves Nerdfighters utilized their existing network of followers from the Brotherhood 2.0 vlog to launch a viral video before the competition. They managed to attract 2,000 active balloon seekers. They also utilized 3,000 Nerdfighters who scanned for Internet traffic related to the competition and specialized in launching a misinformation campaign, hoping to confuse or misdirect other teams. They also created a network of cell phone users to provide direct text message verification of findings.\n\nA team of iPhone application developers formed Army of Eyes, based out of Austin, TX. Their application was developed soon after the original challenge announcement in order to be made available by challenge launch day.\n\nThe team, made up of members of an existing social media site for neighborhood watch communities, performed no recruitment or trading efforts. Their goal was to evaluate the ability of their network to effectively report on abnormal activity within neighborhoods. They were able to successfully locate five of the ten balloons.\n\nThe challenge generated a number of insights. First, it showed how mass and social media can act complementarily. While mass media were useful primarily for spreading general information about the challenge, social media were effective for viral dissemination of information about the challenge to potential team recruits. Second, it showed how social media can be useful as a data mining source. For example, the iSchools team did better than many other teams by simply monitoring public websites. Third, the challenge showed the variety of ways in which social networking can be utilized. The MIT and GTRI teams used them primarily to facilitate fast communication between participants, while the iSchools team used it as a source of information.\n\nFourth, the challenge showed the general effectiveness of using crowdsourcing techniques to solve geographically-distributed, time-sensitive problems. The DARPA program managers were surprised by how quickly the challenge was completed. However, it can be difficult to filter useful data from public sites, and the independent verification of publicly listed information remains a challenge in efficiency and accuracy.\n\nDARPA noted that though social networks can be a powerful source of intelligence, using them may be politically sensitive due to the privacy concerns involved with data mining user content. Similarly, the winning MIT team surmised that their recursive approach would only be effective if the effort's goal was seen to be moral and good by its participants.\n\nThe officially verified coordinates of the balloons, listed by their tag numbers, were:\n\nInspired by the success of the DARPA Network Challenge, DARPA launched the Shredder Challenge in 2011. This competition aimed to explore methods to reconstruct documents shredded by a variety of paper shredding techniques. As with the DARPA Network Challenge, some teams used crowdsourcing to solicit human help in reconstructing the documents. The winning team used a computer-vision algorithm to suggest fragment pairings to human assemblers for verification.\n\nIn January 2012, the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine launched the MyHeartMap Challenge to map Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs) in the city of Philadelphia. According to the organizer Dr. Raina Merchant, \"DARPA succeeded with locating red balloons. AEDs are a natural extension of a brilliant idea.\"\n\nAlso inspired by the DARPA Network Challenge, a contest called Tag Challenge was sponsored by the United States Department of State and the Institute of International Education. Tag Challenge sought to have teams locate and obtain pictures of five individuals in five different cities across North America and Europe within twelve hours on March 31, 2012. Despite the fact that the potential winnings were considerably lower than for the DARPA Network Challenge, organizers sought to test the ability of the methods discovered in that challenge to \"find a person of interest\" rather than a statically located object.\n"}
{"id": "18774750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18774750", "title": "Divinity II", "text": "Divinity II\n\nDivinity II is an action role-playing game developed by Larian Studios. Its first release in 2009 was subtitled Ego Draconis, and was published by dtp entertainment and in the United States by cdv Software Entertainment. The updated 2011 re-release The Dragon Knight Saga which included the expansion Flames of Vengeance, as well as the final 2012 release as Divinity II: Developer's Cut, were published by Focus Home Interactive. \n\nThe defining feature of \"Divinity II\" is the ability to switch between aerial combat as a dragon, and more traditional third-person action-role playing gameplay as a human. It is the third game in the \"Divinity\" franchise, and the first \"Divinity\" game to be released on consoles as well as for Microsoft Windows.\n\nThe main focus of the game is on traditional action-role playing gameplay, which includes completing quests, exploring the game world, and interacting with a variety of non-player characters. \"Divinity II\" utilizes some elements of games like \"Diablo,\" such as a focus on upgrading equipment, randomized magical effects on equipment, unique item sets that offer greater benefits when used together, and some quest mechanics such as markers to show that an NPC will offer a quest to the player. However, it also uses elements from more traditional computer role playing games, such as branching conversation trees, choices which affect other events in the game, and non-combat segments, such as platforming or puzzle elements. When interacting with non-player characters, the player will often have the option to read their minds, which can provide information, extra choices in a quest, or equipment, at a certain cost to their experience points. The 'experience debt' then has to be repaid before they can gain experience again.\n\nPlayers are given a choice of starting packages for their character during the tutorial, but progression is freeform, and the player is free to develop their character in a different direction if they want to. Skills are grouped into 'schools' which correspond to traditional roles, but all skills are available to all characters, allowing mixing between these roles. Multiple forms of crafting exist: alchemy, which allows the player to create potions; necromancy, which allows a player to customize a summonable undead pet; and enchanting, which upgrades the character's equipment.\n\nAfter a certain point in the game, the character gains a base of operations known as the Battle Tower, as well as the ability to become a dragon in large spaces. Dragon combat works similarly to ground-based combat, but in three dimensions; as a dragon, the character still has a regular attack as well as skills they can use, and equipment to improve their abilities.\n\nThe game takes place in the world of Rivellon from \"Divine Divinity\", although much time has passed since the end of \"Divine Divinity\". The player character starts out as a Dragon Slayer at the end of their training, when they are given draconic powers as a way to help fight the last remaining dragons. These powers also erase their memories of their training, but they are reassured that their memories will return quickly. The regular proceedings are interrupted by news of a dragon sighted nearby, so before the initiation is finished, the player character is rushed off with them to where the dragon was last seen.\n\nThroughout the game, the hero has several encounters with Damian, the Damned One. Damian is amassing his armies of monsters to destroy Rivellon. He was driven to such actions by the death of his love, Ygerna, at the hands of his adopted father Lucien (The Divine One, the hero from the first game). Damian seeks to resurrect her and the player seeks to foil his plan due to her evil magic that would make the Damned One even stronger. After fighting his way through Damian's evil minions such as the necromancer who overtook the Battle Tower and the rhyming mage Bellegar, the hero discovers he was tricked into reviving Ygerna himself. He is rewarded for his efforts by being imprisoned in crystal and sent away to a different dimension.\n\nIn the expansion, \"Flames of Vengeance\", the Dragon Knight wakes in a crystal prison on the plane of Hypnoteromachia, where Lucien, the Divine, the messiah figure to Rivellon, is also imprisoned. A ghost called Behrilin comes and offers to free the Divine if the Dragon Knight will help to free him from his earthly prison. The ghost transports him to the last city in Rivellon after Damian's campaign of destruction, only still standing due to the magic shield created by the powerful wizard Zandalor. He begs the players help to destroy the invading force and shore up the city's defenses before the shield is broken.\n\nDevelopment on \"Divinity II\" began around 2006, after Larian Studios had acquired enough money to begin development on a \"Divinity\" sequel in earnest. From the beginning, the game was planned with the feature of transforming into a dragon in mind, and even included a third form, halfway between the dragon and human forms, which would have served as a powerful form for fighting on the ground. However, it was not implemented in the final game, though the model was reused for enemies in the game. The original concepts included more areas, based on the original map of Rivellon in \"Divine Divinity\", as well as features like multiplayer, co-op, and a greater importance given to the Battle Tower. \n\nThe game uses the Gamebryo engine, known for its use in \"\" and \"Fallout 3\".\n\nAfter the initial release of \"Ego Draconis\", Larian was interested in releasing an updated version that would fix many of the bugs and issues with the first game and improve the performance of the engine. At the same time, they developed an expansion that would come after the end of the game, as many people had complained that the original ending of the game had been unsatisfying. The updates to the main game and the expansion were sold together as the \"Flames of Vengeance\" add on, or bundled with the core game as \"The Dragon Knight Saga\". \"Flames of Vengeance\" and \"The Dragon Knight Saga\" were released in Germany in August 2010, and in all other language versions in November 2010. There was no retail United States release of \"The Dragon Knight Saga\" until it was released on the Xbox 360 on April 12, 2011, along with a soundtrack CD and an art book.\n\nFor the tenth anniversary of the Divinity series and the release of the Divinity Anthology, Larian made another update to the game, calling the final version \"Divinity II: Developer's Cut\", which included design documents, concept art, and the ability to access the developer's console in-game through a second executable file.\n\nThe \"Ego Draconis\" Windows Collector's Edition included an 18 cm resin figurine holding a metal letter opener, a cloth-map of Rivellon, a soundtrack EP with seven tracks composed by Kirill Pokrovsky and a temporary tattoo showcasing the \"Divinity II: Ego Draconis\" logo.\n\nFor the release of \"Divinity II: Developer's Cut\" on GOG.com, the website ran a promotion on a pay-what-you-want model, where people who purchased the \"Developer's Cut\" through the bundle were given early access to the bonus materials and the game itself upon release. Larian released behind-the-scenes videos when the sales numbers reached certain milestones, as well as a tech demo of their first, unfinished game, \"The Lady, The Mage, and The Knight\".\n\nOn Metacritic, the PC and 360 versions of \"Ego Draconis\" have an average score of 72 and 62 respectively. \"The Dragon Knight Saga\" has average scores about ten points higher, with the PC version getting an average of 82 and the Xbox 360 version getting an average of 72.\n\nGameZone's Dan Liebman gave both the PC and Xbox 360 versions an 8.4, saying \"Strong narrative and open-ended design are the highlights of this fantasy experience. Divinity II: Ego Draconis will likely be overlooked by many due to the timing of its release, but it offers a genuinely engrossing world for RPG buffs to wallow in.\" GameZone also gave the Dragon Knight Saga a 7 out of 10, stating \"Although the graphical improvements are appreciated, newcomers expecting a visual powerhouse shouldn’t get their hopes up. A good number of glitches can still be found, visual inconsistencies being one of the most striking. Your overall perception of Rivellon’s scope isn’t quite the same as a Bethesda RPG—it’s a limited field of view, despite the actual grandeur of the world.\"\n\nIGN scored it a 4.8 out of 10, stating \"I can’t recommend the Xbox 360 version of this product to anyone.\" However, in the review of \"The Dragon Knight Saga\", another IGN reviewer stated \"If you haven't touched Divinity II at all and you enjoy action-RPGs, you won't be disappointed with the Xbox 360 version.\"\n\nFollowing the success of \"Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga\", Larian expressed an interest in creating more \"Divinity\" games, while also developing the dragon gameplay that was featured in \"Divinity II\". They have announced that one of their next planned games is going to be an action-real time strategy game, with the main character as a Dragon Knight at a time in Rivellon's history when there were many Dragon Knights. The game was released August 6, 2013, and is titled \"\".\n\n"}

{"id": "8376778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8376778", "title": "Francesca Dani", "text": "Francesca Dani\n\nFrancesca Dani, sometimes referred to as Francesca Aurora Dani, (born 5 March 1979 in Florence, Tuscany, Italy) is an Italian travel photographer, and a former cosplayer, net idol model and jewelry designer.\n\nDani began her cosplay career in November 1998 after participating in Lucca Comics and Games as Sailor Moon. She claims to have participated at the request of a friend, whom she had produced cosplay clothes for earlier on. Dani unexpectedly won an award at the contest, which granted her local fame and kickstarted her career.\n\nDani quickly launched her website under the Geocities free hosting service, subsequently transferring it under her own domain \"francescadani.com\" in 2001. Understanding the potential of internet way before most other celebrities, she launched a pay website on 14 April 2002. The website used to feature short videos and thousands of photographs depicting her posing in various risque outfits, swimsuits, lingerie, and other fetish outfits. Although often showing very provocative outfit, Dani has reportedly never posed fully naked pictures, in spite of numerous requests she claims to have received in that regard.\n\nFrom April 2002 to September 2005 she modeled for an American paysite called \"Varietease\", but in October 2005 she left the site for her own paysite under the domain \"francescadani.com\". \n\nDani gained fame in Japan on 25 December 2002, during an appearance on popular TV show \"Sekai Marumie\", directed by Takeshi Kitano, aired on Nippon TV. Dani was chosen for a special live interview, filmed in her hometown, because of her status as an international cosplayer. \n\nThree years later, Dani gained global fame after winning the World Cosplay Summit in Nagoya, Japan, in 2005 as a member of the Italian team, which also featured Giorgia Vecchini (who also went on to become a prominent cosplayer) and the Livia Fata sisters. \n\nThe event boosted her popularity in Japan. Immediately after the event, she was chosen as a spokesmodel for \"Bodyline\", a Japanese manufacturer of Gothic and Lolita dresses: Francesca's photos appeared on Bodyline packages. At the end of 2005, Livedoor, an Internet service provider based in Tokyo, Japan, started selling Francesca's digital photo-books at \"DLsite\", a digital distribution website. \n\nFrancesca has appeared in dozens in magazines around the world, most notably for \"Maxim\" who hailed her as \"¡La cosplayer más popular en la web!\" (\"The most popular cosplayer on the web!\") \nIn 2008 she published a video DVD titled \"DNA of Angel, Soul of Devil\", celebrating 10 years of her career. It includes a documentary on her story, directed and produced by her longtime photographer and partner, Paolo Cellammare. By his own admission, Cellammare's career as an international cosplay photographer has started and flourished thanks to a long-standing partnership with Dani.\n\nIn 2011, Francesca Dani was featured in an Italian-language book by Francesca Mazzuccato, as an example of a person who has chosen strip-tease as a way to express creativity.\n\nAmong others, Dani has participated in Cosplay fairs and events in Italy, Japan, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Brazil, where she was asked to stage a performance to present a new manga called \"Death Note\". Francesca has personally produced dozens of costumes during her long cosplay career, taking pride in the fact that all her costumes have been made solely by her. \n\nIn 2010 Dani began designing her own brand of gothic-inspired jewellery, launching under the brand name of \"My Bones\". She launched a specific website for this product line, which was online under the francescadanistore.com URL until 2015. \n\nThe last public cosplay event that Francesca has been seen at was Novegro Comics, Italy, in February 2010, where she acted as a honorary jury member. There she portrayed famous videogame character Princess Zelda. Following that and a few other photosets that she published on her website, Dani suddenly retired from cosplay and modelling, and ceased appearing in public events such as fairs and contests. Her web site was left online with the existing content. However, no new content was added until it was replaced by her new photography site, in 2015.\n\nIn 2015 Dani took up photography, focusing initially on nocturnal landscapes shot in the surrounding of her hometown Florence. During a trip to Northern Norway in late 2015, she took her first photography of the Northern lights, a theme she continues to develop still today. She claims that her pictures have a recurring theme, with small human shapes lost in large, empty spaces. According to Dani, this enhances the insignificant role that human beings play, when compared to the immense power of nature.\n\nIn 2017 she joined \"LappOne\", a Swedish tour operator, where she currently performs various duties such as photographic tour leader, marketing, IT and web site development.\n\nHer photography works have exhibited in Rome, London, Paris and New York. One of her photographic projects, Ghosts of Chernobyl , is aimed to raise awareness among future generations of the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, which, in Dani's words \"has killed not only people, but also families, history and human dignity\". She regularly arranges guided tours to the Chernobyl exclusion zone and Pripyat in Ukraine, organized through an Italian travel agent.\n\nOther than her website, Dani makes widespread use of social networks to display her work. \n\n\n"}

Concocted from the pairing of the talents of Quentin Tarantino, and Robert Rodriguez. It has spawned, so far: a motion picture, two direct-to-video sequels, a video game, a comic book, collectable statues, as well as a TV series.\n\nDanny Trejo is the only actor to appear in all the original three films and the series; although Michael Parks appears in both \"From Dusk till Dawn\", and \"The Hangman's Daughter\". Rodriguez, Tarantino and Lawrence Bender served as producers on all of the three movies.\n\n\"From Dusk Till Dawn\" is a 1996 horror crime action thriller film written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Robert Rodriguez. The movie stars Harvey Keitel, George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino and Juliette Lewis.\n\n\"From Dusk till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money\" is an American horror crime action thriller released on March 16, 1999. The film was an early test release by Dimension Films for the direct-to-video market. It was co-written and directed by Scott Spiegel, the co-writer of \"Evil Dead II\" and director of \"Intruder\". The film was filmed on location in South Africa and features cameos by Bruce Campbell and Tiffani Thiessen. It won a Saturn Award from The Academy of Science Fiction Fantasy & Horror Films for the Best Home Video Release of 1999.\n\n\"From Dusk till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter\" is a 1999 American horror film that serves as a prequel to the 1996 film, \"From Dusk till Dawn\". It was released directly to video and was nominated for the Saturn Award's Best Home Video Release category.\n\nIn late 2010, the production of a fourth film in the series was discussed, but, as of June 2013, further work on this possibility has not been revealed.\n\nRodriguez developed a for his cable network El Rey. It stars Robert Patrick as Jacob Fuller, Eiza Gonzalez as Santanico Pandemonium, and Don Johnson as Sheriff McGraw. The series debuted on El Rey in the United States on March 11, 2014, and internationally on Netflix two days later.\n\nRichard \"Richie\" Gecko is the name of two fictional characters in the \"From Dusk till Dawn\" film series. The original Richie Gecko is one of the protagonists in the 1996 film \"From Dusk Till Dawn\". He is a nerdy, short-fused, rapist psychopath that only his brother, Seth Gecko (a cool, suave, short-fused, sociopathic anti-hero), could stand. He was portrayed by Quentin Tarantino on film, and an alternate version of the character is portrayed by Zane Holtz on TV.\n\nThere is not much information regarding Richie's back story, although a news report about the robbery that is seen during the film states that he holds prior convictions for robbery and sex crimes. \"From Dusk till Dawn\" tells the story of the Gecko Brothers right after their latest botched bank-robbery/kidnapping attempt. He rapes and murders their hostage, a bank teller, for which Seth scolds him. After fleeing to Mexico, they unexpectedly cross paths with a sect of vampires using a strip club as a feeding ground. Richie has a chance to bond with his brother, before his insane antics catch up with him and results in an untimely \"death\". Richie returns to life as an undead zombie-like blood sucker. Seth is then left with the task of putting his brother's evil-possessed carcass out of its misery. The Gecko brothers are mentioned in \"\". Bo Hopkins references Edgar McGraw's cold demeanor and distracted nature: \"Oh, them Gecko brothers killed his daddy.\" The Gecko brothers briefly appear in a photo cameo in the black comedy \"Curdled\". In additional, Katie Houge, news reporter from the first film, appears, again portrayed by Kelly Preston.\n\nIn late 2013, it was reported that a parallel universe had begun production. This incarnation of Richie will be played by Zane Holtz. Mixing ideas from the original first and third films, the show pits the humans, led by Seth, who will be played by D.J. Cotrona against the vampires, led by the wicked Santanico Pandemonium, played by Eiza Gonzalez and Sheriff McGraw, played by Don Johnson. This series stars Robert Patrick, as Jacob Fuller.\n\nSantanico Pandemonium, formerly Esmeralda or Kisa, is a fictional character from the \"From Dusk till Dawn\" media franchise. She is the primary Queen Vampire of the \"Titty Twister\", a strip club in the middle of a desolate part of Mexico. In the film series, she is portrayed by Salma Hayek and Ara Celi. She is played by Eiza González in \"\". The name of Santanico is based on the Mexican Nunsploitation film \"Satánico pandemonium\". Although the original film was not very successful at the box office, the film has achieved a cult status. Hayek's role as Santanico was generally well received by viewers.\n\nSantanico Pandemonium is most often seen in her human form, which resembles a beautiful Mexican erotic dancer. She has the ability to transform from human to vampire and vice versa. While in vampire form, her face transforms to have reptilian-like features and sharp teeth. She often uses her human form to seduce her victims before biting them. She is a barefooter and is most often seen wearing a red/black bra and underwear combo, occasionally also wearing a crown and a cape with a snake around her neck. She is vulnerable to sunlight.\n\nBorn a Dhampir named Esmeralda in Mexico in 1894, she was the daughter of the Hangman and the High Priestess Vampire, Quixla. Esmeralda knew nothing about her mother or what had happened to her. Instead, she was raised by her father, the local Hangman with an eerie past. During her childhood the Hangman attempted to kill Esmeralda on several occasions, but she kept coming back.\n\nIn 1913, when Esmeralda is nineteen years old, she is kidnapped by Johnny Madrid (a local outlaw), after a daring gallows escape with the help of Reece, an American outlaw. With the hangman, who fears the worst for his daughter, and a local posse on their trail, Madrid meets with his gang. Together, they rob a stagecoach containing American author Ambrose Bierce and newly-wed couple John and Mary Newlie. As night falls they go to a whorehouse that would later become the Titty Twister in From Dusk till Dawn. Esmeralda soon discovers the truth of her heritage after being turned by her mother Quixla and grandmother, an ancient vampire. She later hypnotizes her father, kisses him, then quickly feeds on his neck, turning him. She begs Madrid to stay, but Quixla lunges at Madrid and Bierce as they tried to escape. Seeing this, the Hangman, who is now a vampire, opens the locked door, which kills Quixla in the sunlight. Madrid and Bierce flee, ignoring Esmeralda's pleas.\n\nEsmeralda — now known as Santanico Pandemonium, vampire heiress — takes her place as vampire queen and the main attraction at the Titty Twister. Throughout the century she puts on big shows at the bar, as seen when the Geckos arrived to await the arrival of their contact in 1996. After her show is over, Chet the bouncer, having recovered from his beating, enters the bar with a group of people looking to fight the Geckos. This leads to a fight; Richie is stabbed in the hand by Razor Charlie, and Seth takes out his gun and starts shooting people.\n\nBut as their backs are turned, Santanico morphs into a horrible creature, jumps on Richie's back and sinks her fangs into his neck, killing him. This spur-of-the-moment surge of bloodlust, triggered by his bleeding hand, sparks the other vampires’ feeding frenzy. She is killed in the original film when she is impaled by a chandelier shot down by Seth — after threatening to turn him into her vampire slave.\n\nSantanico kills two characters in the original movie — most notably Richard Gecko. The other is featured in the deleted scenes section of the laserdisc and DVD of From Dusk till Dawn where Santanico (in her human form) sits on the lap of a dazed and wounded biker (played by Greg Nicotero of KNB Effects). As she is holding his gaze for a moment, a second mouth — resembling a monstrous snake — erupts out of her mouth and bites his head off.\n\n\"She's Just Killing Me\", a song by rock band ZZ Top and their first single released from their 1996 album, \"Rhythmeen\". The song is featured in the film From Dusk till Dawn and on the soundtrack which also includes Mexican Blackbird by ZZ Top. The music video shows ZZ Top playing in a bar then cuts to video clips from the film \"From Dusk till Dawn\" featuring George Clooney and Salma Hayek as Seth Gecko and Santanico Pandemonium, respectively.\n\nIn the parallel universe 2014 TV series \"\", Santanico Pandemonium was born 500 years prior to the first season. She was kept by her tribe to use for blood offerings to their gods. When she tried to run away (feeling guilty from the sacrifices made in her name) she was chased and forced to become a vampire. She was imprisoned in a temple and became the leader of the vampire blood cult — eventually becoming the \"queen vampire\" at the Titty Twister bar that was built onto the temple in modern times to lure in travelers. Throughout the final episodes of season one, Santanico lures Seth and Richard Gecko into the 'Titty Twister', then officially converts Richard Gecko into a vampire when suffering loss of blood. She then persuades Gecko to help her escape the Titty Twister when she forces Richard and his brother Seth to complete a test through an ancient labyrinth under the Twister in hope of being freed. The Geckos survive their test, as Richard swallows the serpent containing her blood, making him her prince. Carlos Madrigal betrays Santanico by siding with Narciso, a messenger of the vampire blood cult and the nine lords of the vampire blood cult. He kidnaps Richard, wanting Seth to bring him the $30 million in oil bonds. A final battle ensues, before the sun rises to cleanse the bar/temple of its cult. Santanico is freed from the Twister and escapes with Richard Gecko to the United States.\n\nIn season two, more of Santanico’s past is revealed when Lord Amancio Malvado, the head of the nine lords of the vampire blood cult is shown at the Twister Saloon (before fully established as the ‘Titty Twister’) informs Santanico that her real name is actually Kisa. He also attempts to get Santanico to forget about her human past life (before she was known as ‘Santanico Pandemonium’). Santanico is implied to be sexually abused by Malvado, as well as Carlos Madrigal, who has a romantic fixation with her. Also in season two, Santanico is viewed by other vampires as a form of a goddess. Towards the end of season two, Santanico officially finds Amancio Malvado at his new hideout, a bar named ‘Jacknife Jed’s’; however, she is poisoned by Malvado and falls into an unconscious state; Mavaldo attempts to leave with her for 'El Rey', before she eventually regains her consciousness. She eventually kills Malvado, then ends her association with the Geckos and departing into a seemingly new life.\n\nIn season three, it is revealed by Seth and Richard Gecko that Santanico is now living in Piedras Negras, who ran an underground fight ring. She was implied to be in a relationship with a human, a woman named Manola. The Geckos attempt to persuade Santanico to join them to help them fight various demons who have escaped from the ancient labyrinth of the Titty Twister and to persuade remaining vampires to join them also.\n\n\"From Dusk till Dawn\" is a first-person shooter that is based on events that transpire directly after the end of the film \"From Dusk till Dawn\". Released in 2001 for Windows, it was distributed by Cryo Interactive.\n\n"}

{"id": "53391134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53391134", "title": "Hollow Knight", "text": "Hollow Knight\n\nHollow Knight is a Metroidvania video game developed and published by Team Cherry. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux in 2017, and for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One in 2018. Development was partially funded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, raising over 57,000 by the end of 2014.\n\nThe game tells the story of a knight on a quest to uncover the secrets of the long-abandoned insect kingdom of Hallownest, whose haunting depths draw in the adventurous and brave with promises of treasures and answers to ancient mysteries.\n\n\"Hollow Knight\" is a 2D Metroidvania action-adventure game, which takes place in Hallownest, a fictional ancient kingdom. The player controls an insect-like, silent, and nameless knight while exploring the underground world. The knight wields a nail, which is a cone-shaped sword, used both in combat and environmental interaction.\n\nIn most areas of the game the player encounters hostile bugs and other sorts of creatures. Combat involves using the nail to strike enemies from a short distance. The player can also use spells, allowing for long-range attacks. Defeated enemies drop currency called Geo. The knight starts with a limited number of mask shards, which represent hit points of the character. More mask shards can be collected throughout the game to increase the player's health. When the knight takes damage from an enemy or from the environment, a mask is destroyed. By striking enemies, the knight gains Soul, which is stored in the Soul Vessel. If all masks are lost, the knight dies and a Shade appears at that place. The player needs to defeat the Shade to recover the lost currency and to carry normal amount of Soul. The game continues from a last visited bench—they are scattered throughout the game world and they act as save points—but the player loses all Geo and can hold a smaller amount of Soul. Initially the player can only use Soul to \"Focus\" and regenerate mask shards, but as the game progresses the player unlocks several offensive spells, which consume Soul. \n\nMany areas feature more challenging enemies (bosses) which the player may or may not need to defeat in order to progress further. Defeating some bosses grants the player new abilities. Later in the game, the player acquires a dream nail. It enables the player to face more challenging versions of some bosses.\n\nDuring the game, the player encounters non-player characters, with whom they can interact. These characters provide information about the game's plot or lore, offer aid, and sell items or services. The player can upgrade the knight's nail to deal more damage or find soul vessels to carry more Soul. During the course of the game, the player acquires items that provide new movement abilities. They include an additional jump mid-air (Monarch Wings), adhering to walls and jumping off them (Mantis Claw), and a quick dash (Mothwing Cloak). The player can also acquire other combat abilities, known as nail arts, and the aforementioned spells. To further customise the knight, the player can equip various Charms, which can be found or bought. Some of their effects include: improved combat abilities or spells, more masks or their regeneration, better movement skills, easier collecting of currency or of Soul, transformation. Equipping Charms takes up limited slots, called notches. Wearing more Charms than notches is possible, but it causes the knight to receive twice as much damage. \n\nHallownest consists of several large, inter-connected areas with unique themes. Although \"Hollow Knight\" does not bind the player to one path through the game nor require to explore the whole world, there are obstacles that limit the player's access to an area. The player may need to progress in the story of the game, or acquire a specific movement ability, a magic skill or an item to progress further. To fast travel through the game's world, the player can utilise Stag Stations, terminals of a network of tunnels; the player can only travel to previously visited and unlocked stations.\n\nAs the player enters a new area, they do not have access to the map of the surroundings. They need to find Cornifer, the Cartographer, in order to buy a rough map. As the player explores an area, the map becomes more accurate and complete, although it is updated only when sitting on a bench. The player will need to buy specific items to complete maps, to see points of interest, and to place markers. The knight's position on the map can only be seen if the player is carrying a specific Charm.\n\nAt the game's outset, the player character, or Knight, arrives in a small town above Hallownest's ruins called Dirtmouth, seeking to venture within. As they journey through the forgotten kingdom, the Knight encounters the possessed remnants of Hallownest's former residents and other creatures, slowly being overcome by a mysterious Infection. They also encounter Hornet, the self-proclaimed protector of Hallownest's ruins, who attempts to stop the Knight's quest on multiple occasions. Through learning the history of Hallownest on their journey, the Knight discovers that they are a failed Vessel, one of many artificial beings created by the Pale King to stop the Infection by sealing it away within them. The Hollow Knight, the sole successful Vessel, was given this duty and magically sealed within the Black Egg Temple by three powerful bugs known as the Dreamers, but due to unforeseen emotions, the Infection still escaped.\n\nDepending on the player's actions, \"Hollow Knight\" has multiple endings. In the first ending, the player Knight defeats the Hollow Knight and absorbs the Infection into itself to become the new Vessel. As chains manifest to hold the Knight in place, the Temple is once again resealed and the plague is held at bay, though its true source still survives. The second ending occurs if the player is able to collect an item called the Void Heart before fighting the Hollow Knight. Halfway through the battle, Hornet arrives to offer assistance and briefly holds the Hollow Knight at bay. Choosing to continue fighting normally causes her to be knocked unconscious. The ending then plays out like the first, except Hornet is sealed in with the player Knight and her mask is used as the new Dreamer seal upon the Temple door. \n\nThe third ending occurs if the player Knight collects the Void Heart and uses the Awakened Dream Nail ability to enter the Hollow Knight's mind when Hornet arrives to help. Here, the player Knight challenges The Radiance, a moth-like goddess that was the true source of the Infection, seeking to reduce all bugs back to a mindless state and eliminate the Pale King's influence. With the power of the Void Heart, the player Knight commands the forces of the Void, with the aid of the Hollow Knight and the shades of the failed Vessels, to consume The Radiance. As the darkness from the Temple fades, Hornet awakens to find the chamber empty, except for the player Knight's broken and empty shell.\n\nTwo additional endings were added with the \"Godmaster\" content update, in which the Knight can battle harder versions of all of the bosses in the game in a series of challenges set by a being called the Godseeker. If the Knight completes these challenges and battles the Absolute Radiance as the final boss, the darkness of the Void is summoned again to defeat her, but the Knight instead appears to transform into a massive Void creature and outright destroys the Absolute Radiance. The Godhome arena is consumed by darkness as the Godseeker begins oozing Void, which eventually erupts and destroys her as well before appearing to spread out into Hallownest. Hornet then is seen standing by the Temple as the tendrils of Infection turn black. A creature approaches her armed with a weapon and rattling chains, implied to be the Hollow Knight now free from its prison, and Hornet readies for battle. \n\nThe fifth ending is unlocked if the Knight has given the Godseeker a Delicate Flower item before defeating the Absolute Radiance. The ending is identical to the fourth, but both the Godseeker and the Void are instead destroyed in a flash of pale light, leaving only the flower behind.\n\n\"Hollow Knight\" was revealed on Kickstarter in November 2014 and reached its initial funding goal in December of the same year. The game reached a beta state in September 2015 and continued to achieve numerous stretch goals to add in more content after an engine switch from Stencyl to Unity. Some of the stretch goal content, such as the Colosseum of Fools and The Abyss, still made it into the game despite those goals not having been attained.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch version of \"Hollow Knight\" was announced in January 2017 and released on 12 June 2018. Team Cherry originally planned to make their game available on the Wii U. Development of the Wii U version began in 2016, alongside the PC version, and it eventually shifted to Switch. The creators of \"Hollow Knight\" worked with another Australian developer, Shark Jump Studios, to speed up the porting process. Initially, Team Cherry planned the Switch version to arrive \"not too long after the platform’s launch\", subsequently they delayed it to early 2018. A release date was not announced until the Nintendo Direct presentation at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018 on 12 June 2018, when it was unveiled the game would be available later that day via Nintendo eShop.\n\nIn June 2017, Team Cherry partnered with IndieBox, a monthly subscription box service, to create an exclusive, physical release of the game. This limited collector’s edition included a DRM-free game disc, the official soundtrack, an instruction manual, a Steam key, and various custom-designed collectible items.\n\nIn the same month, Team Cherry announced a free major content update to the game entitled \"Hidden Dreams\", which was released on 3 August 2017. The update includes two new optional boss encounters, two new songs in the soundtrack, a new fast-travel system, and a new Stag Station to discover. The content can be accessed at any point in the game, though it is advised to wait until the late game due to the difficulty.\n\nOn 26 October 2017, Team Cherry launched the second free content update, entitled \"The Grimm Troupe\". This content pack adds new major quests, new boss fights, new charms, new enemies, and other content. The update also added support for Russian, Portuguese, and Japanese.\n\nOn 31 January 2018, Team Cherry announced their third free content updated entitled \"Gods and Glory\". The expansion title was later changed to \"Godmaster\" due to copyright. This expansion unlocks new characters, boss fights, music, a new game mode as well as two new endings. \"Godmaster\" was released on 23 August 2018. \n\nOn 20 April 2018, Team Cherry launched a new update to the game entitled \"Lifeblood\" after a public beta testing period which started from 24 March 2018. This update was not one of the 3 originally planned DLC updates for the game, and mainly focuses on enhancing technical aspects of the game. It brings about various optimizations, changes to the color palette, bug fixes, minor additions as well as a new boss fight.\n\n\"Hollow Knight\"s initial release received \"generally favorable\" reviews and the Nintendo Switch version was met with \"universal acclaim\", according to review aggregator Metacritic. Jed Whitaker of \"Destructoid\" praised it as a \"masterpiece of gaming ..., and certainly art worthy of being in a museum\" and, on \"PC Gamer\", Tom Marks called it a \"new classic\". Reviewers spoke highly of \"Hollow Knight\"s atmosphere, visuals, sound and music, noting the vastness of the game's world.\n\nCritics recognized the combat system as simple, unsurprising or nuanced; they praised its responsiveness, or \"tightness\", similarly to the movement system. On \"IGN\", Tom Marks stated: \"The combat in Hollow Knight is relatively straightforward, but starts out tricky ... It rewards patience and skill massively\". In his review on \"PC Gamer\", Marks praised the \"brilliant\" charm system: \"What's so impressive about these charms is that I could never find a 'right' answer when equipping them. There were no wrong choices.\" \"NintendoWorldReport\" stated: \"Charms offer a huge variety of upgrades ... Some charms ... were so essential that removing them felt like trading a part of myself for a better chance at an upcoming battle.\"\n\nDifficulty of \"Hollow Knight\" received attention from reviewers. Vikki Blake of \"Eurogamer\" called the game \"ruthlessly tough, even occasionally unfair\". For \"Nintendo World Report\"s Adam Abou-Nasr it also seemed unfair—he had so frustratingly hard that I cannot recommend this game' angrily scrawled in [his] notes\"—but \"it eventually clicked\". \"Destructoid\" \"never found any of the bosses to be unfair\". Critics described Hollow Knight as challenging; \"Destructoid\" and \"Nintendo World Report\" reviewers felt a sense of accomplishment after difficult fights. Critics also made comparisons to \"Dark Souls\", noting the mechanic of losing currency on death and having to defeat a Shade to regain it. \"Destructoid\" praised this feature, as well as the holding down of a button to heal, because \"[t]hey circumvent a couple of issues games have always had, namely appropriate punishment for failing, and a risk-reward system\".\n\nAs of July 2018, \"Hollow Knight\" has sold over 1,250,000 copies.\nThe game had sold over 500,000 copies by November 2017 and surpassed 1,000,000 in sales on PC platforms on 11 June 2018, one day before releasing on Nintendo Switch, where it has sold over 250,000 copies only two weeks after its launch.\n\nThe game was nominated for \"Best PC Game\" in \"Destructoid\"s Game of the Year Awards 2017, and for \"Best Platformer\" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards. It won the award for \"Best Platformer\" in \"PC Gamer\"s 2017 Game of the Year Awards.\n"}
{"id": "713072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=713072", "title": "Hyperion Entertainment", "text": "Hyperion Entertainment\n\nHyperion Entertainment CVBA (formerly Hyperion Entertainment VOF) is a Belgian software company which in its early years focused in porting Windows games to Amiga OS, Linux and Mac OS. In 2001, they accepted a contract by Amiga Incorporated to develop AmigaOS 4 and mainly discontinued their porting business to pursue this development. AmigaOS 4 runs on the AmigaOne systems, Commodore Amiga systems with a Phase5 PowerUP accelerator board, Pegasos II systems and Sam440/Sam460 systems.\n\nHyperion Entertainment was founded in April 1999 with Ben Hermans and Evert Carton in charge. In their own words, \"After Belgian lawyer Benjamin Hermans wondered why no one had ever tried to license PC games to do Amiga ports.\" Hyperion does not maintain programmer staff but sub-contracts software programmers for projects as necessary. Hans-Joerg Frieden, who had previously worked on ports of the games \"Descent\" and \"Abuse\" as well as the Warp3D library, was contracted to be Hyperion's main developer. For the next few years, Hyperion would port several game titles to the Amiga and later Linux and the Macintosh, starting with Amiga port of Heretic II in 2000.\n\nThe port of Heretic II was generally well received by the Amiga press, but had weak sales. Following this, Hyperion set out to target a broader range of platforms: Amiga, Linux, and Mac OS. Later in 2000, Hyperion completed Linux version of SiN. The Amiga port has been postponed due to hardware requirements and ultimately not released. They also approached Monolith Productions to port their Lithtech engine, culminating in their port of \"\" for Amiga, Linux, and Mac OS in 2001. The game had not sold as well as had been hoped, most notably on Linux, despite becoming a best seller on Tux Games. Hyperion stated that Linux users were likely to dual boot with Windows to play easily available games rather than purchase more expensive specialised versions years after release. In early 2002 Hyperion introduced Amiga port of \"\". Improved version for AmigaOS 4 followed in 2010. After id Software released source code, Hyperion marketed later in 2002 a commercial Amiga port of \"Quake II\". A Linux port of \"Gorky 17\" was developed by Hyperion and published by Linux Game Publishing in 2006, version for AmigaOS 4 was released nearly a decade later in 2015.\n\nDuring work on the Heretic II port, Hyperion Entertainment developers created an OpenGL subset called MiniGL which sits on top of Warp3D to ease porting of 3D games. The MiniGL library was released for free use to other software developers.\n\nIn 2001 Hyperion announced that, after licensing the rights from Amiga, Inc, it would be working on the long-awaited successor to AmigaOS 3.9, and to this end concentrated most of its effort on the development of AmigaOS 4. Hyperion claimed and still claim that it is based upon AmigaOS 3.1 source code, and to a lesser extent certain AmigaOS 3.9 sources. A quick port of 68k AmigaOS to PowerPC was originally planned, with new features added as development continued. Ben Hermans, writing on Amiga forum Ann.lu, claimed that these sources, along with the source of the PPC kernel WarpOS would be sufficient to provide a version to users within a year, making his now-infamous \"change some flags and recompile\" comment.\n\nAmigaOS 4.0 was first released to end-users and second level betatesters in April 2004, with AmigaOS 4.1 following in September 2008. It is currently still in development.\n\nIn 2004, Hyperion attempted to obtain a licence for an AmigaOS 4 native port of the file manager Directory Opus which had originally and been developed on the Amiga, but for which development had since moved to the Microsoft Windows platform. However talks between Hyperion and GP Software broke down.\n\nThe first Managing Partner of Hyperion, Benjamin Hermans, in the period between announcement and release of AmigaOS 4, ignited a great deal of community controversy by repeatedly claiming that MorphOS, an AmigaOS-like competitor (which had been released in complete form in 2003), was illegal, and had on several occasions threatened to take legal action against it either on the grounds that it was parasitic competition to AmigaOS 4, or even that it was actually based on stolen AmigaOS source code. No evidence to support either claim ever became public, neither did any legal action against MorphOS take place, although neither prevented such views being repeated commonly in public Amiga forums and mailing lists and even accepted as fact by some. This situation was inflamed by ex-Commodore engineer Dave Haynie, who backed up Herman's claims: \"If you have seen the Amiga source code, you cannot produce a legally separate work-alike\", though again without any direct evidence.\n\nThe dispute did not enter the courts, but in the forums the argument was bitter. Hermans claimed that Bill Buck leading the Genesi company funding MorphOS was a \"con-artist\".\n\nEvert Carton took over the Managing Partner position after Benjamin Hermans stepped down in 2003, due to lack of time for daily administrative work. Timothy de Groote became another Partner in 2003.\n\nIn 2007, Hyperion were sued by Amiga Incorporated for trademark infringement in the Washington Western District Court in Seattle, US. Amiga, Inc. sued Hyperion for breach of contract, trademark violation and copyright infringement concerning the development and marketing of AmigaOS 4.0, stating that Hyperion had continued to develop and market AmigaOS 4 without paying agreed royalties and had continued to do so even after warned to cease and desist.\n\nHyperion launched a counter action, claiming fraud in Amiga, Inc. handling of Amiga intellectual properties and debts, including the use of debt-holding shell companies, by shifting responsibility between these shell companies. They also claimed that Amiga, Inc. had failed to uphold their part of the contract and had been untruthful in correspondence; and that they had failed to deliver the AmigaOS 3.1 source that AmigaOS 4 was developed from, forcing Hyperion to find it elsewhere. In spite of that ongoing legal dispute, in Autumn 2007 Hyperion released a standalone version of AmigaOS 4 for classic Amiga, an action Amiga, Inc. claimed as illegal.\n\nOn 29 May 2007, the new Managing Partner stated under oath - without further evidence - that the open-source AmigaOS reimplementation AROS was \"probably illegal\", as documented on page 27 of court documents related to the Amiga-Hyperion court case.\n\nOn 30 September 2009, Hyperion and Amiga, Inc reached settlement. Hyperion were granted an exclusive license to develop and market AmigaOS 4 and subsequent versions with the name AmigaOS. However, the \"Amiga\" trademark remained with Amiga, Inc. and was then also licensed to other parties, including Commodore USA and iContain. This meant that \"Amiga\" branded hardware could and would be sold without AmigaOS 4.\n\nIn 2009, Hyperion changed legal status from business partnership (VOF) to company with limited liability (CVBA).\n\nOn 24 April 2011 Evert Carton announced stepping down as the managing partner of Hyperion. In charge of the company were then Ben Hermans and Timothy de Groote.\n\nOn 27 January 2015, Hyperion Entertainment was declared insolvent. Ben Hermans has claimed that this was an administrative mistake by a third party and that the company would appeal the insolvency decision. The declaration was overturned on 2 April 2015 and the company posted clarification on its website.\n\nAmigaOS 4 developer and Aminet administrator Costel Mincea joined Hyperion in mid 2015 as a third director. Hyperion reported in January 2017 that Mr. Hermans has resigned as a director, in charge of the company remained Timothy De Groote and Costel Mincea. In October 2017 Hyperion was removed from the Belgium's official company register due to not filling annual reports for the last three years. Hyperion remedied this by supplying required reports to the National Bank of Belgium.\n\nHyperion's game ports include these: \"Heretic II\", \"\", \"Gorky 17\", \"Quake II\", \"SiN\" and \"\". Hyperion also announced to have acquired the license to port \"Worms Armageddon\" and \"Soldier of Fortune\", but these were not released.\n\n"}

{"id": "48351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48351", "title": "Irving Berlin", "text": "Irving Berlin\n\nIrving Berlin (born Israel Beilin () – September 22, 1989) was an American composer and lyricist, widely considered one of the greatest songwriters in American history. His music forms a great part of the Great American Songbook. Born in Imperial Russia, Berlin arrived in the United States at the age of five. He published his first song, \"Marie from Sunny Italy\", in 1907, receiving 33 cents for the publishing rights, and had his first major international hit, \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" in 1911. He also was an owner of the Music Box Theatre on Broadway. It is commonly believed that Berlin could not read sheet music, and was such a limited piano player that he could only play in the key of F-sharp unless using his custom piano equipped with a transposing lever. \n\n\"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" sparked an international dance craze in places as far away as Berlin's native Russia, which also \"flung itself into the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania.\" Over the years he was known for writing music and lyrics in the American vernacular: uncomplicated, simple and direct, with his stated aim being to \"reach the heart of the average American,\" whom he saw as the \"real soul of the country.\" In doing so, said Walter Cronkite, at Berlin's 100th birthday tribute, he \"helped write the story of this country, capturing the best of who we are and the dreams that shape our lives.\"\n\nHe wrote hundreds of songs, many becoming major hits, which made him famous before he turned thirty. During his 60-year career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs, including the scores for 20 original Broadway shows and 15 original Hollywood films, with his songs nominated eight times for Academy Awards. Many songs became popular themes and anthems, including \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\",\"Easter Parade\",\"Puttin' on the Ritz\", \"Cheek to Cheek\", \"White Christmas\", \"Happy Holiday\", \"Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)\", and \"There's No Business Like Show Business\". His Broadway musical and 1943 film \"This is the Army\", with Ronald Reagan, had Kate Smith singing Berlin's \"God Bless America\" which was first performed in 1938.\n\nBerlin's songs have reached the top of the charts 25 times and have been extensively re-recorded by numerous singers including The Andrews Sisters, Eddie Fisher, Al Jolson, Fred Astaire, Ethel Merman, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, Rosemary Clooney, Cher, Diana Ross, Bing Crosby, Sarah Vaughan, Ruth Etting, Fanny Brice, Marilyn Miller, Rudy Valee, Nat King Cole, Billie Holiday, Doris Day, Jerry Garcia, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Ella Fitzgerald, Michael Buble, Lady Gaga, and Christina Aguilera.\n\nComposer Douglas Moore sets Berlin apart from all other contemporary songwriters, and includes him instead with Stephen Foster, Walt Whitman, and Carl Sandburg, as a \"great American minstrel\"—someone who has \"caught and immortalized in his songs what we say, what we think about, and what we believe.\" Composer George Gershwin called him \"the greatest songwriter that has ever lived\", and composer Jerome Kern concluded that \"Irving Berlin has no \"place\" in American music—he \"is\" American music.\"\n\nBerlin was born on May 11, 1888, in the Russian Empire. His exact birthplace is unknown. Although Berlin's family came from the shtetel of Tolochin (in latter-day Belarus), he may have been born in Tyumen, Siberia. He was one of eight children of Moses (1848–1901) and Lena Lipkin Beilin (1850–1922). His father, a cantor in a synagogue, uprooted the family to America, as did many other Jewish families in the late 19th century. On September 14, 1893 the family arrived in New York City. Upon their arrival at Ellis Island, the name \"Beilin\" was changed to \"Baline\". According to biographer Laurence Bergreen, as an adult Berlin admitted to no memories of his first five years in Russia except for one: \"he was lying on a blanket by the side of a road, watching his house burn to the ground. By daylight the house was in ashes.\" As an adult, Berlin said he was unaware of being raised in abject poverty since he knew no other life.\n\nTsar Alexander III of Russia and then Tsar Nicholas II, his son, had revived with utmost brutality the anti-Jewish pogroms, which created the spontaneous mass exodus to America. The pogroms were to continue until 1906, with thousands of other Jewish families also needing to escape, including those of George and Ira Gershwin, Al Jolson, Sophie Tucker, L. Wolfe Gilbert, Jack Yellen, Louis B. Mayer (of MGM), and the Warner brothers. It has been suspected that the Beilin family also fled due to these pogroms, though there is no evidence to indicate that there were pogroms in Tolochin or Tyumen when the Beilins left for America. When they reached Ellis Island, Israel was put in a pen with his brother and five sisters until immigration officials declared them fit to be allowed into the city.\n\nAfter their arrival in New York City, the Baline family lived briefly in a basement flat on Monroe Street, and then moved to a three-room tenement at 330 Cherry Street. His father, unable to find comparable work as a cantor in New York, took a job at a kosher meat market and gave Hebrew lessons on the side, to support his family. He died a few years later when Irving was thirteen years old.\n\nNow, with only a few years of schooling, eight-year-old Irving began helping to support his family. He became a newspaper boy, hawking \"The Evening Journal.\" One day while delivering newspapers, according to Berlin's biographer and friend, Alexander Woollcott, he stopped to look at a ship departing for China and became so entranced that he didn't see a swinging crane, which knocked him into the river. When he was fished out after going down for the third time, he was still holding in his clenched fist the five pennies he earned that day.\n\nHis mother took a job as a midwife, and three of his sisters worked wrapping cigars, common for immigrant girls. His older brother worked in a sweatshop assembling shirts. Each evening, when the family came home from their day's work, Bergreen writes, \"they would deposit the coins they had earned that day into Lena's outspread apron.\" \n\nMusic historian Philip Furia writes that when \"Izzy\" began to sell newspapers in the Bowery, he was exposed to the music and sounds coming from saloons and restaurants that lined the crowded streets. Young Berlin sang some of the songs he heard while selling papers, and people would toss him some coins. He confessed to his mother one evening that his newest ambition in life was to become a singing waiter in a saloon.\n\nHowever, before Berlin was fourteen his meager income was still adding less than his sisters' to the family's budget, which made him feel worthless. He then decided to leave home and join the city's ragged army of other young immigrants. He lived in the Bowery, taking up residence in one of the lodging houses that sheltered the thousands of other homeless boys in the Lower East Side. Bergreen describes them as being uncharitable living quarters, \"Dickensian in their meanness, filth, and insensitivity to ordinary human beings.\"\n\nWith few survival skills having left school around the age of thirteen, he realized that formal employment was out of the question. His only ability was acquired from his father's vocation as a singer, and he joined with a few other youngsters who went to saloons on the Bowery and sang to customers. Itinerant young singers like them were common on the Lower East Side. Berlin would sing a few of the popular ballads he heard on the street, hoping people would pitch him a few pennies. From these seamy surroundings he became street wise, with a real and lasting education. Music was his only source of income and he picked up the language and culture of the ghetto lifestyle.\n\nBerlin learned what kind of songs appealed to audiences, writes Begreen: \"well-known tunes expressing simple sentiments were the most reliable.\" He soon began plugging songs at Tony Pastor's Music Hall in Union Square and in 1906, when he was 18, got a job as a singing waiter at the Pelham Cafe in Chinatown. Besides serving drinks, he sang made-up \"blue\" parodies of hit songs to the delight of customers.\n\nBiographer Charles Hamm writes that in Berlin's free time after hours, he taught himself to play the piano. Never having lessons, after the bar closed for the night, young Berlin would sit at a piano in the back and begin improvising tunes. His first attempt at actual songwriting was \"Marie From Sunny Italy,\" written in collaboration with the Pelham's resident pianist, Mike Nicholson, from which he earned 37 cents in royalties. A spelling error on the sheet music to the published song included the spelling of his name as \"I. Berlin.\"\n\nBerlin continued writing and playing music at Pelham Cafe and developing an early style. He liked the words to other people's songs but sometimes the rhythms were \"kind of boggy,\" and he might change them. One night he delivered some hits composed by his friend, George M. Cohan, another kid who was getting known on Broadway with his own songs. When Berlin ended with Cohan's \"Yankee Doodle Boy,\" notes Whitcomb, \"everybody in the joint applauded the feisty little fellow.\"\n\nNobel Prize-winning author Rudyard Kipling, living up the coast during that period, said he \"was shocked and intrigued by the screeching squalor he found in the dirty gray tenement canyons of immigrant New York.\" He described it as worse than the slums of Bombay, but was nonetheless \"impressed and moved by the Jews,\" says Whitcomb, noting how the songs by the little immigrant boys \"saluted the Stars and Stripes.\" Kipling wrote, \"For these immigrant Jews are a race that survives and thrives against all odds and flags.\"\n\nMax Winslow (c. 1883–1942), a staff member at music publisher Harry Von Tilzer Company, noticed Berlin's singing on many occasions and became so taken with his talent that he tried to get him a job with his firm. Von Tilzer said that Max claimed to have \"discovered a great kid,\" and raved about him so much that Von Tilzer hired Berlin.\n\nLater, in 1908, when he was 20, Berlin took a new job at a saloon named Jimmy Kelly's in the Union Square neighborhood. There, he was able to collaborate with other young songwriters, such as Edgar Leslie, Ted Snyder, Al Piantadosi, and George A. Whiting. In 1909, the year of the premiere of Israel Zangwill's \"The Melting Pot\", he got another big break as a staff lyricist with the Ted Snyder Company.\n\nBerlin rose as a songwriter in Tin Pan Alley and on Broadway. In 1911, Emma Carus introduced his first world-famous hit, \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\", followed by a performance from Berlin himself at the Friars' Frolic of 1911. He became an instant celebrity, and the featured performer later that year at Oscar Hammerstein's vaudeville house, where he introduced dozens of other songs. The \"New York Telegraph\" described how two hundred of his street friends came to see \"their boy\" on stage: \"All the little writer could do was to finger the buttons on his coat while tears ran down his cheeks—in a vaudeville house!\"\n\nRichard Corliss, in a \"Time\" magazine profile of Berlin, described \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" as a march, not a rag, \"its savviest musicality comprised quotes from a bugle call and \"Swanee River.\" The tune revived the ragtime fervor that Scott Joplin had begun a decade earlier, and made Berlin a songwriting star. From its first and subsequent releases, the song was near the top of the charts as others sang it: Bessie Smith, in 1927, and Louis Armstrong, in 1937; no. 1 by Bing Crosby and Connee Boswell; Johnny Mercer in 1945; Al Jolson, in 1947 and Nellie Lutcher in 1948. Add Ray Charles's big-band version in 1959, and \"Alexander\" had a dozen hit versions in just under a half century.\n\nInitially the song was not recognized as a hit, however; Broadway producer Jesse Lasky was uncertain about using it, although he did include it in his \"Follies\" show. It was performed as an instrumental but did not impress audiences, and was soon dropped from the show's score. Berlin regarded it as a failure. He then wrote lyrics to the score, played it again in another Broadway Review, and this time \"Variety\" news weekly called it \"the musical sensation of the decade.\" Composer George Gershwin, foreseeing its influence, said it was \"the first real American musical work,\" adding, \"Berlin had shown us the way; it was now easier to attain our ideal.\"\n\nBerlin was \"flabbergasted\" by the sudden international popularity of the song, and wondered why it became a sudden hit. He decided it was partly because the lyrics, \"silly though it was, was fundamentally right...[and] the melody... started the heels and shoulders of all America and a good section of Europe to rocking.\" In 1913, Berlin was featured in the London revue Hello Ragtime, where he introduced \"That International Rag\", a song he had written for the occasion.\n\nFuria writes that the international success of \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" gave ragtime \"new life and sparked a national dance craze.\" Two dancers who expressed that craze were Irene and Vernon Castle. In 1914, Berlin wrote a ragtime revue, \"Watch Your Step,\" which starred the couple and showcased their talents on stage. That musical revue became Berlin's first complete score with songs that \"radiated musical and lyrical sophistication.\" Berlin's songs signified modernism, and they signified the cultural struggle between Victorian gentility and the \"purveyors of liberation, indulgence, and leisure,\" says Furia. The song \"Play a Simple Melody\" became the first of his famous \"double\" songs in which two different melodies and lyrics are counterpointed against one another.\n\n\"Variety\" called \"Watch Your Step\" the \"first syncopated musical,\" where the \"sets and the girls were gorgeous.\" Berlin was then twenty-six, and the success of the show was riding on his name alone. \"Variety\" said the show was a \"terrific hit\" from its opening night. It compared Berlin's newfound status as a composer with that of the Times building: \"That youthful marvel of syncopated melody is proving things in \"Watch Your Step\", firstly that he is not alone a rag composer, and that he is one of the greatest lyric writers America has ever produced.\"\n\nWhitcomb also points out the irony that Russia, the country Berlin's family was forced to leave, flung itself into \"the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania.\" Prince Felix Yusupov, for instance, a recent Oxford undergraduate of Russian noble lineage and heir to the largest estate in Russia, was described by his dance partner as \"wriggling around the ballroom like a demented worm, screaming for 'more ragtime and more champagne'.\"\n\nSome of the songs Berlin created came out of his own sadness. For instance, in 1912 he married Dorothy Goetz, the sister of songwriter E. Ray Goetz. She died six months later of typhoid fever contracted during their honeymoon in Havana. The song he wrote to express his grief, \"When I Lost You,\" was his first ballad. It was an immediate popular hit and sold more than a million copies.\n\nHe began to realize that ragtime was not a good musical style for serious romantic expression, and over the next few years adapted his style by writing more love songs. In 1915 he wrote the hit \"I Love a Piano\", a comical and erotic ragtime love song.\n\nBy 1918 he had written hundreds of songs, mostly topical, which enjoyed brief popularity. Many of the songs were for the new dances then appearing, such as the \"grizzly bear\", \"chicken walk\", or fox trot. After a Hawaiian dance craze began, he wrote \"That Hula-Hula\", and then did a string of southern songs, such as \"When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam\". During this period, he was creating a few new songs every week, including songs aimed at the various immigrant cultures arriving from Europe. On one occasion, Berlin, whose face was still not known, was on a train trip and decided to entertain the fellow passengers with some music. They asked him how he knew so many hit songs, and Berlin modestly replied, \"I wrote them.\"\n\nAn important song that Berlin wrote during his transition from writing ragtime to lyrical ballads was \"A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody,\" which became one of Berlin's \"first big guns,\" says historian Alec Wilder. The song was written for Ziegfeld's \"Follies of 1919\" and became the musical's lead song. Its popularity was so great that it later became the theme for all of Ziegfeld's revues, and the theme song in the 1936 film \"The Great Ziegfeld\". Wilder puts it on the same level as Jerome Kern's \"pure melodies,\" and in comparison with Berlin's earlier music, says it's \"extraordinary that such a development in style and sophistication should have taken place in a single year.\"\n\nOn April 1, 1917, after President Woodrow Wilson declared that America would enter World War I, Berlin felt that Tin Pan Alley should do its duty and support the war with inspirational songs. Berlin wrote the song, \"For Your Country and My Country\", stating that \"we must speak with the sword not the pen to show our appreciation to America for opening up her heart and welcoming every immigrant group.\" He also co-wrote a song aimed at ending ethnic conflict, \"Let's All Be Americans Now.\"\n\nIn 1917, Berlin was drafted into the United States Army, and the news of his induction became headline news, with one paper headline reading, \"Army Takes Berlin!\" But the Army wanted Berlin, now aged 30, to do what he knew best: write songs. While stationed with the 152nd Depot Brigade at Camp Upton, he then composed an all-soldier musical revue titled \"Yip Yip Yaphank\", written to be patriotic tribute to the United States Army. By the following summer, the show was taken to Broadway where it also included a number of hits, including \"Mandy\" and \"Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning\", which he performed himself.\n\nThe shows earned $150,000 for a camp service center. One song he wrote for the show but decided not to use, he would introduce twenty years later: \"God Bless America.\"\n\nBerlin returned to Tin Pan Alley after the war and in 1921 created a partnership with Sam Harris to build the Music Box Theater. He maintained an interest in the theater throughout his life, and even in his last years was known to call the Shubert Organization, his partner, to check on the receipts. In its early years, the theater was a showcase for revues by Berlin. As theater owner, producer and composer, he looked after every detail of his shows, from the costumes and sets to the casting and musical arrangements.\n\nAccording to Berlin biographer David Leopold, the theater, located at 239 West 45th St., was the only Broadway house built to accommodate the works of a songwriter. It was the home of Berlin's \"Music Box Revue\" from 1921 to 1925 and \"As Thousands Cheer\" in 1933 and today includes an exhibition devoted to Berlin in the lobby.\n\nBy 1926, Berlin had written the scores to two editions of the \"Ziegfeld Follies\" and four \"Music Box Revues.\" Berlin's \"Music Box Revues\" spanned the years of 1921-1926, premiering songs such as \"Say It With Music\", \"Everybody Step\", and \"Pack Up Your Sings and Go to the Devil\". \"Life magazine\" called him the \"Lullaby Kid\", noting that \"couples at country-club dances grew misty-eyed when the band went into \"Always\", because they were positive that Berlin had written it just for them. When they quarreled and parted in the bitter-sweetness of the 1920s, it was Berlin who gave eloquence to their heartbreak by way of \"What'll I Do\" and \"Remember\" and \"All Alone.\"\n\nThis ballad of love and longing was a hit record for Paul Whiteman and had several other successful recordings in 1924. Twenty-four years later, the song went to no. 22 for Nat Cole and no. 23 for Frank Sinatra.\n\nWritten when he fell in love with Ellin Mackay, who later became his wife. The song became a hit twice (for Vincent Lopez and George Olsen) in its first incarnation. There were four more hit versions in 1944–45. In 1959, Sammy Turner took the song to no. 2 on the R&B chart. It became Patsy Cline's postmortem anthem and hit no. 18 on the country chart in 1980, 17 years after her death, and a tribute musical called \"Always... Patsy Cline\", played a two-year Nashville run that ended in 1995. Leonard Cohen included a cover of this song on his 1992 release \"The Future (Leonard Cohen album)\".\n\nWritten after his first daughter's birth, he distilled his feelings about being married and a father for the first time: \"Blue days, all of them gone; nothing but blue skies, from now on.\" The song was introduced by Belle Baker in \"Betsy\", a Ziegfeld production. It became hit recording for Ben Selvin and one of several Berlin hits in 1927, it was performed by Al Jolson in the first feature sound film, \"The Jazz Singer\", that same year. In 1946, it returned to the top 10 on the charts with Count Basie and Benny Goodman. In 1978, Willie Nelson made the song a no. 1 country hit, 52 years after it was written.\n\nAn instant standard with one of Berlin's most \"intricately syncopated choruses\", this song is associated with Fred Astaire, who sang and danced to it in the 1946 film \"Blue Skies\". The song was written in 1928 with a separate set of lyrics and was introduced by Harry Richman in 1930 of the same name. In 1939, Clark Gable sang it in the movie \"Idiot's Delight\". In 1974 it was featured in the movie \"Young Frankenstein\" by Mel Brooks, and was a no. 4 hit for the techno artist Taco in 1983. In 2012 it was used for a flash mob wedding event in Moscow.\n\nThis waltz-time song was a hit for Rudy Vallee in 1929, and in 1937, updated to a four-quarter-time swing arrangement, was a top hit for Tommy Dorsey. It was on the charts at no. 13 in 1953 for The Four Tunes and at no. 15 for the Bachelors in 1965, 36 years after its first appearance.\n\nRudy Vallee performed it on his radio show, and the song was a hit for George Olsen, Connee Boswell (she was still known as Connie), and Ozzie Nelson's band. Aretha Franklin produced a single of the song in 1963, 31 years later. Furia notes that when Rudy Vallee first introduced the song on his radio show, the \"song not only became an overnight hit, it saved Vallee's marriage: The Vallees had planned to get a divorce, but after Vallee sang Berlin's romantic lyrics on the air, \"both he and his wife dissolved in tears\" and decided to stay together.\n\nPerformed by Dick Powell in the 1937 film \"On the Avenue\". Later it had four top-12 versions, including by Billie Holiday and Les Brown, who took it to no. 1.\n\nThe song was written by Berlin twenty years earlier, but he filed it away until 1938 when Kate Smith needed a patriotic song to mark the 20th anniversary of Armistice Day, celebrating the end of World War I. Its release near the end of the Depression, which had by then gone on for nine years enshrined a \"strain of official patriotism intertwined with a religious faith that runs deep in the American psyche,\" stated the \"New York Times\".\n\nBerlin's daughter, Mary Ellin Barrett, states that the song was actually \"very personal\" for her father, and was intended as an expression of his deep gratitude to the nation for merely \"allowing\" him, an immigrant raised in poverty, to become a successful songwriter. \"To me,\" said Berlin, \"'God Bless America' was not just a song but an expression of my feeling toward the country to which I owe what I have and what I am.\" The \"Economist\" magazine writes that \"Berlin was producing a deep-felt paean to the country that had given him what he would have said was everything.\"\nIt quickly became a second National Anthem after America entered World War II a few years later. Over the decades it has earned millions for the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, to whom Berlin assigned all royalties. In 1954, Berlin received a special Congressional Gold Medal from President Dwight D. Eisenhower for contributing the song.\n\nThe song was heard after September 11, 2001, as U.S. senators and congressmen stood on the capitol steps and sang it after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. It is often played by sports teams such as major league baseball. The Philadelphia Flyers hockey team started playing it before crucial contests. When the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team pulled off the \"greatest upset in sports history,\" referred to as the \"Miracle on Ice\", the players spontaneously sang it as Americans were overcome by patriotism.\n\nThough most of his works for the Broadway stage took the form of revues—collections of songs with no unifying plot—he did write a number of book shows. \"The Cocoanuts\" (1929) was a light comedy with a cast featuring, among others, the Marx Brothers. \"Face the Music\" (1932) was a political satire with a book by Moss Hart, and \"Louisiana Purchase\" (1940) was a satire of a Southern politician obviously based on the exploits of Huey Long. \"As Thousands Cheer\" (1933) was a revue, also with book by Moss Hart, with a theme: each number was presented as an item in a newspaper, some of them touching on issues of the day. The show yielded a succession of hit songs, including \"Easter Parade\" sung by Marilyn Miller and Clifton Webb, \"Heat Wave\" (presented as the weather forecast), \"Harlem on My Mind\", and \"Supper Time\", a song about racial violence inspired by a newspaper headline about a lynching, sung by Ethel Waters. She once said about the song, \"If one song can tell the whole tragic history of a race, 'Supper Time' was that song. In singing it I was telling my comfortable, well-fed, well-dressed listeners about my people...those who had been slaves and those who were now downtrodden and oppressed.\" \n\nBerlin loved his country, and wrote many songs reflecting his patriotism. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau requested a song to inspire Americans to buy war bonds, for which he wrote \"Any Bonds Today?\" He assigned all royalties to the United States Treasury Department. He then wrote songs for various government agencies and likewise assigned all profits to them: \"Angels of Mercy\" for the American Red Cross; \"Arms for the Love of America\", for the Army Ordnance Department; and \"I Paid My Income Tax Today,\" again to Treasury.\n\nWhen the United States joined World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Berlin immediately began composing a number of patriotic songs. His most notable and valuable contribution to the war effort was a stage show he wrote called \"This is the Army\". It was taken to Broadway and then on to Washington, D.C. (where President Franklin D. Roosevelt attended). It was eventually shown at military bases throughout the world, including London, North Africa, Italy, Middle East, and Pacific countries, sometimes in close proximity to battle zones. Berlin wrote nearly three dozen songs for the show which contained a cast of 300 men. He supervised the production and traveled with it, always singing \"Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning\". The show kept him away from his family for three and a half years, during which time he took neither salary nor expenses, and turned over all profits to the Army Emergency Relief Fund.\n\nThe play was adapted into a movie of the same name in 1943, directed by Michael Curtiz, co-starring Joan Leslie and Ronald Reagan, who was then an army lieutenant. Kate Smith also sang \"God Bless America\" in the film with a backdrop showing families anxious over the coming war. The show became a hit movie and a morale-boosting road show that toured the battlefronts of Europe. The shows and movie combined raised more than $10 million for the Army, and in recognition of his contributions to troop morale, Berlin was awarded the Medal of Merit by President Harry S. Truman. His daughter, Mary Ellin Barrett, who was 15 when she was at the opening-night performance of \"This is the Army\" on Broadway, remembered that when her father, who normally shunned the spotlight, appeared in the second act in soldier's garb to sing \"Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning,\" he was greeted with a standing ovation that lasted 10 minutes. She adds that he was in his mid-50's at the time, and later declared those years with the show were the \"most thrilling time of his life.\"\n\nThe grueling tours Berlin did performing \"This Is The Army\" left him exhausted, but when his old and close friend Jerome Kern, who was the composer for \"Annie Get Your Gun\", died suddenly, producers Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II persuaded Berlin to take over composing the score.\n\nLoosely based on the life of sharpshooter Annie Oakley, the music and lyrics were written by Berlin, with a book by Herbert Fields and his sister Dorothy Fields, and directed by Joshua Logan. At first Berlin refused to take on the job, claiming that he knew nothing about \"hillbilly music\", but the show ran for 1,147 performances and became his most successful score. It is said that the showstopper song, \"There's No Business Like Show Business\", was almost left out of the show altogether because Berlin mistakenly thought that Rodgers and Hammerstein didn't like it. However, it became the \"ultimate uptempo show tune.\"\n\nOn the origin of another of the play's leading songs, Logan described how he and Hammerstein privately discussed wanting another duet between Annie and Frank. Berlin overheard their conversation, and although the show was to go into rehearsal within days, he wrote the song \"Anything You Can Do\" a few hours later.\n\nOne reviewer commented about the play's score, that \"its tough wisecracking lyrics are as tersely all-knowing as its melody, which is nailed down in brassy syncopated lines that have been copied—but never equaled in sheer melodic memorability—by hundreds of theater composers ever since.\" Singer and musicologist, Susannah McCorkle writes that the score \"meant more to me than ever, now that I knew that he wrote it after a grueling world tour and years of separation from his wife and daughters.\" Historian and composer Alec Wilder says that the perfection of the score, when compared to his earlier works, was \"a profound shock.\"\n\nApparently the \"creative spurt\" in which Berlin turned out several songs for the score in a single weekend was an anomaly. According to his daughter, he usually \"sweated blood\" to write his songs. \"Annie Get Your Gun\" is considered to be Berlin's best musical theatre score not only because of the number of hits it contains, but because its songs successfully combine character and plot development. The song \"There's No Business Like Show Business\" became \"Ethel Merman's trademark.\"\n\nBerlin's next show, \"Miss Liberty\" (1949), was disappointing, but \"Call Me Madam\" in 1950, starring Ethel Merman as Sally Adams, a Washington, D.C. socialite, loosely based on the famous Washington hostess Perle Mesta, fared better, giving him his second greatest success. After a failed attempt at retirement, in 1962, at the age of 74, he returned to Broadway with \"Mr. President\". Although it ran for eight months, (with the premiere attended by President John F. Kennedy), it was not one of his successful plays.\n\nAfterwards, Berlin officially announced his retirement and spent his remaining years in New York. He did, however, write one new song, \"An Old-Fashioned Wedding,\" for the 1966 Broadway revival of \"Annie Get Your Gun\" starring Ethel Merman. Though he lived 23 more years, this was one of Berlin's final published compositions.\n\nBerlin maintained a low profile through the last decades of his life, almost never appearing in public after the late 1960s, even for events held in his honor. However, he continued to maintain control of his songs through his own music publishing company, which remained in operation for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1927, his song \"Blue Skies\", was featured in the first feature-length talkie, \"The Jazz Singer\", with Al Jolson. Later, movies like \"Top Hat\" (1935) became the first of a series of distinctive film musicals by Berlin starring performers like Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, Judy Garland, Ginger Rogers, and Alice Faye. \"Top Hat\" featured a brand new score, as did several more, including \"Follow the Fleet\" (1936), \"On the Avenue\" (1937), \"Carefree\" (1938), and \"Second Fiddle\" (1939). Starting with \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" (1938), he often blended new songs with existing ones from his catalog. He continued this process with the films \"Holiday Inn\" (1942), \"Blue Skies\" (1946) and \"Easter Parade\" (1948), with Judy Garland and Fred Astaire, and \"There's No Business Like Show Business\" (1954).\n\nThe 1942 film \"Holiday Inn\" introduced \"White Christmas\", one of the most recorded songs in history. First sung in the film by Bing Crosby (along with Marjorie Reynolds, whose voice was dubbed by Martha Mears), it has sold over 50 million records and stayed no. 1 on the pop and R&B charts for 10 weeks. Crosby's version is the best-selling single of all time. Music critic Stephen Holden credits this partly to the fact that \"the song also evokes a primal nostalgia—a pure childlike longing for roots, home and childhood—that goes way beyond the greeting imagery.\"\n\nRichard Corliss also notes that the song was even more significant having been released soon after America entered World War II: [it] \"connected with... GIs in their first winter away from home. To them it voiced the ache of separation and the wistfulness they felt for the girl back home, for the innocence of youth...\" Poet Carl Sandburg wrote, \"We have learned to be a little sad and a little lonesome without being sickly about it. This feeling is caught in the song of a thousand jukeboxes and tune whistled in streets and homes. \"I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas'. When we sing that we don't hate anybody. And there are things we love that we're going to have sometimes if the breaks are not too bad against us. Way down under this latest hit of his, Irving Berlin catches us where we love peace.\"\n\n\"White Christmas\" won Berlin the Academy Award for Best Music in an Original Song, one of seven Oscar nominations he received during his career. In subsequent years, it was re-recorded and became a top-10 seller for numerous artists: Frank Sinatra, Jo Stafford, Ernest Tubb, The Ravens and The Drifters. It would also be the last time a Berlin song went to no. 1 upon its release.\n\nBerlin is the only Academy Award presenter and Academy Award winner to open the \"envelope\" and read his or her own name (for \"White Christmas\"). This result was so awkward for Berlin (since he had to present the Oscar to himself) that the Academy changed the rules of protocol the following year to prevent this situation from arising again.\n\nTalking about Irving Berlin's \"White Christmas\", composer–lyricist Garrison Hintz stated that although songwriting can be a complicated process, its final result should sound simplistic. Considering the fact that \"White Christmas\" has only eight sentences in the entire song, lyrically Mr. Berlin achieved all that was necessary to eventually sell over 100 million copies and capture the hearts of the American public at the same time.\n\nAccording to Saul Bornstein (a.k.a. Sol Bourne, Saul Bourne), Berlin's publishing company manager, \"It was a ritual for Berlin to write a complete song, words and music, every day.\" Berlin has said that he \"does not believe in inspiration,\" and feels that although he may be gifted in certain areas, his \"most successful compositions were the \"result of work.\" He said that he did most of his work under pressure. He would typically begin writing after dinner and continue until 4 or 5 in the morning. \"Each day I would attend rehearsals,\" he said, \"and at night write another song and bring it down the next day.\"\n\nNot always certain about his own writing abilities, he once asked a songwriter friend, Victor Herbert, whether he should study composition. \"You have a natural gift for words and music,\" Mr. Herbert told him. \"Learning theory might help you a little, but it could cramp your style.\" Berlin took his advice. Herbert later became a moving force behind the creation of ASCAP, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. In 1914, Berlin joined him as a charter member of the organization that has protected the royalties of composers and writers ever since. In 1920, Irving Berlin became a member of SACEM, the French Society of Authors, Composers, and Publishers.\n\nIn later years, Berlin emphasized his conviction, saying that \"it's the lyrics that makes a song a hit, although the tune, of course, is what makes it last.\" He played almost entirely in the key of F sharp so that he could stay on the black notes and owned three transposing pianos so as to change keys by moving a lever. Though Berlin eventually learned to write music, he never changed his method of dictating songs to a \"musical secretary\".\n\nAs a result, Wilder says that many admirers of the music of Jerome Kern, Richard Rodgers and Cole Porter were unlikely to consider Berlin's work in the same category because they forgot or never realized that Berlin wrote many popular tunes, such as \"Soft Lights and Sweet Music,\" \"Supper Time,\" and \"Cheek to Cheek.\" Some are even more confused because he also wrote more romantic melodies, such as \"What'll I Do?\" and \"Always.\" Wilder adds that \"in his lyrics as in his melodies, Berlin reveals a constant awareness of the world around him: the pulse of the times, the society in which his is functioning. There is nothing of the hothouse about his work, urban though it may be.\"\n\nComposer Jerome Kern recognized that the essence of Irving Berlin's lyrics was his \"faith in the American vernacular\" and was so profound that his best-known songs \"seem indivisible from the country's history and self-image.\" Kern, along with George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II and Cole Porter brought together Afro-American, Latin American, rural pop, and European operetta.\n\nBerlin, however, did not follow that method. Instead, says music critic Stephen Holden, Berlin's songs were always simple, \"exquisitely crafted street songs whose diction feels so natural that one scarcely notices the craft...they seem to flow straight out of the rhythms and inflections of everyday speech.\" It led composer George Gershwin to claim that he learned from Berlin that ragtime, which later became jazz, \"was the only musical idiom in existence that could aptly express America.\"\n\nAmong Berlin's contemporaries was Cole Porter, whose music style was often considered more \"witty, sophisticated, [and] dirty,\" according to musicologist Susannah McCorkle. Of the five top songwriters, only Porter and Berlin wrote both their own words and music. However, she notes that Porter, unlike Berlin, was a Yale-educated and wealthy Midwesterner whose songs were not successful until he was in his thirties. She notes further that it was \"Berlin [who] got Porter the show that launched his career.\"\n\nIn 1912, he married Dorothy Goetz, the sister of the songwriter E. Ray Goetz. She died six months later of typhoid fever, which she contracted during their honeymoon in Havana. The song he wrote to express his grief, \"When I Lost You,\" was his first ballad.\nYears later in the 1920s, he fell in love with a young heiress, Ellin Mackay, the daughter of Clarence Mackay, the socially prominent head of the Postal Telegraph Cable Company, and an author in her own right. Because Berlin was Jewish and she was a Catholic of Irish descent, their life was followed in every possible detail by the press, which found the romance of an immigrant from the Lower East Side and a young heiress a good story.\n\nThey met in 1924, and her father opposed the match from the start. He went so far as to send her off to Europe to find other suitors and forget Berlin. However, Berlin wooed her with letters and song over the airwaves such as \"Remember\" and \"All Alone,\" and she wrote him daily. Biographer Philip Furia writes that newspapers rumored they were engaged before she returned from Europe, and some Broadway shows even performed skits of the \"lovelorn songwriter.\" After her return, she and Berlin were besieged by the press, which followed them everywhere. \"Variety\" reported that her father vowed that their marriage \"would only happen 'over my dead body.'\" As a result, they decided to elope and were married in a simple civil ceremony at the Municipal Building away from media attention.\n\nThe wedding news made the front-page of the \"New York Times\". The marriage took her father by surprise, and he was stunned upon reading about it. The bride's mother, however, who was at the time divorced from Mackay, wanted her daughter to follow the dictates of her own heart. Berlin had gone to her mother's home before the wedding and had obtained her blessing.\n\nThere followed reports that the bride's father now disowned his daughter because of the marriage. In response, Berlin gave the rights to \"Always\", a song still played at weddings, to her as a wedding present. Ellin Mackay was thereby guaranteed a steady income regardless of what might happen with the marriage. For years, Mackay refused to speak to the Berlins, but they reconciled after the Berlins lost their first son, Irving Berlin Jr., on Christmas Eve in 1928, less than one month after he was born.\n\nTheir marriage remained a love affair and they were inseparable until she died in July 1988 at the age of 85. They had four children during their 63 years of marriage: Irving, who died in infancy on Christmas Day 1928; Mary Ellin Barrett, Elizabeth Irving Peters and Linda Louise Emmet.\n\nIn 1916, in the earlier phase of Berlin's career, producer and composer George M. Cohan, during a toast to the young Berlin at a Friar's Club dinner in his honor, said, \"The thing I like about Irvie is that although he has moved up-town and made lots of money, it hasn't turned his head. He hasn't forgotten his friends, he doesn't wear funny clothes, and you will find his watch and his handkerchief in his pockets, where they belong.\"\nFuria says that throughout Berlin's life he often returned on foot to his old neighborhoods in Union Square, Chinatown, and the Bowery. He never forgot those childhood years when he \"slept under tenement steps, ate scraps, and wore secondhand clothes,\" and described those years as hard but good. \"Every man should have a Lower East Side in his life,\" he said. He used to visit \"The Music Box Theater\", which he founded and which still stands at 239 West Forty-Fifth St. From 1947 to 1989, Berlin's home in New York City was 17 Beekman Place.\n\nGeorge Frazier of \"Life\" magazine found Berlin to be \"intensely nervous,\" with a habit of tapping his listener with his index finger to emphasize a point, and continually pressing his hair down in back\" and \"picking up any stray crumbs left on a table after a meal.\" While listening, \"he leans forward tensely, with his hands clasped below his knees like a prizefighter waiting in his corner for the bell... For a man who has known so much glory,\" writes Frazier, \"Berlin has somehow managed to retain the enthusiasm of a novice.\"\n\nBerlin's daughter wrote in her memoir that her father was a loving, if workaholic, family man who was \"basically an upbeat person, with down periods.\" In his final decades he retreated from public life. Her parents liked to celebrate every single holiday with their children, and \"They seemed to understand the importance, particularly in childhood, of the special day, the same every year, the special stories, foods, and decorations and that special sense of well-being that accompanies a holiday.\" Although he did comment to his daughter about her mother's lavish Christmas spending, \"I gave up trying to get your mother to economize. It was easier just to make more money.\"\n\nBerlin voted for both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates, but he supported the presidential candidacy of General Dwight Eisenhower, and his song \"I Like Ike\" featured prominently in the Eisenhower campaign. In his later years he also became more conservative in his views on music. According to his daughter, \"He was consumed by patriotism.\" He often said, \"I owe all my success to my adopted country\" and once rejected his lawyers' advice to invest in tax shelters, insisting, \"I \"want\" to pay taxes. I love this country.\"\n\nBerlin was a Freemason, and was a member of Munn Lodge no. 190, New York City, the Scottish Rite Valley of New York City, and Mecca Shrine Temple.\n\nBerlin was a staunch advocate of civil rights. Berlin was honored in 1944 by the National Conference of Christians and Jews for \"advancing the aims of the conference to eliminate religious and racial conflict.\" His 1943 production \"This Is The Army\", was the first integrated division army unit in the United States. In 1949, the Young Men's Hebrew Association (YMHA) honored him as one the twelve \"most outstanding Americans of Jewish faith.\" While he was culturally Jewish, he was religiously agnostic. Berlin's Civil Rights Movement support also made him a target of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who continuously investigated him for years.\n\nBerlin died in his sleep on September 22, 1989, of heart attack and natural causes, in New York City, at the age of 101. He was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.\n\nOn the evening following the announcement of his death, the marquee lights of Broadway playhouses were dimmed before curtain time in his memory. President George H. W. Bush said Berlin was \"a legendary man whose words and music will help define the history of our nation.\" Just minutes before the President's statement was released, he joined a crowd of thousands to sing Berlin's \"God Bless America\" at a luncheon in Boston. Former President Ronald Reagan, who costarred in Berlin's 1943 musical \"This Is the Army,\" said, \"Nancy and I are deeply saddened by the death of a wonderfully talented man whose musical genius delighted and stirred millions and will live on forever.\"\n\nMorton Gould, the composer and conductor who was president of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), of which Berlin was a founder, said, \"What to me is fascinating about this unique genius is that he touched so many people in so many age groups over so many years. He sounded our deepest feelings—happiness, sadness, celebration, loneliness.\" Ginger Rogers, who danced to Berlin tunes with Fred Astaire, told The Associated Press upon hearing of his death that working with Berlin had been \"like heaven.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\", after his death in 1989, wrote, \"Irving Berlin set the tone and the tempo for the tunes America played and sang and danced to for much of the 20th century.\" An immigrant from Russia, his life became the \"classic rags-to-riches story that he never forgot could have happened only in America.\" During his career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs and was a legend by the time he turned 30. He went on to write the scores for 20 original Broadway shows and 15 original Hollywood films, with his songs nominated for Academy Awards on eight occasions. Music historian Susannah McCorkle writes that \"in scope, quantity, and quality his work was amazing.\" Others, such as Broadway musician Anne Phillips, says simply that \"the man is an American institution.\"\n\nDuring his six-decade career, from 1907 to 1966, he produced sheet music, Broadway shows, recordings, and scores played on radio, in films and on television, and his tunes continue to evoke powerful emotions for millions around the world. He wrote songs like \"Alexander's Ragtime Band,\" \"Cheek to Cheek\", \"There's No Business Like Show Business\", \"Blue Skies\" and \"Puttin' On the Ritz.\" Some of his songs have become holiday anthems, such as \"Easter Parade\", \"White Christmas\" and \"Happy Holiday\". \"White Christmas\" alone sold over 50 million records, the top single selling song in recording history, won an ASCAP and an Academy Award, and is one of the most frequently played songs ever written.\n\nIn 1938, \"God Bless America\" became the unofficial national anthem of the United States, and on September 11, 2001, members of the House of Representatives stood on the steps of the Capitol and solemnly sang \"God Bless America\" together. The song returned to no. 1 shortly after 9/11, when Celine Dion recorded it as the title track of a 9/11 benefit album. The following year, the Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp of Berlin. By then, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of New York had received more than $10 million in royalties from \"God Bless America\" as a result of Berlin's donation of royalties. According to music historian Gary Giddins, \"No other songwriter has written as many anthems... No one else has written as many pop songs, period... [H]is gift for economy, directness, and slang, presents Berlin as an obsessive, often despairing commentator on the passing scene.\"\n\nIn 1934, \"Time\" put him on its cover and inside hailed \"this itinerant son of a Russian cantor\" as \"an American institution.\" And again, in 1943, the same magazine described his songs as follows:\n\nThey possess a permanence not generally associated with Tin Pan Alley products and it is more than remotely possible that in days to come Berlin will be looked upon as the Stephen Foster of the 20th century.\n\nAt various times, his songs were also rallying cries for different causes: He produced musical editorials supporting Al Smith and Dwight Eisenhower as presidential candidates, he wrote songs opposing Prohibition, defending the gold standard, calming the wounds of the Great Depression, and helping the war against Hitler, and in 1950 he wrote an anthem for the state of Israel. Biographer David Leopold adds that \"We all know his songs... they are all part of who we are.\"\n\nAt his 100th-birthday celebration in May 1988, violinist Isaac Stern said, \"The career of Irving Berlin and American music were intertwined forever—American music was born at his piano,\" while songwriter Sammy Cahn pointed out: \"If a man, in a lifetime of 50 years, can point to six songs that are immediately identifiable, he has achieved something. Irving Berlin can sing 60 that are immediately identifiable... [Y]ou couldn't have a holiday without his permission.\" Composer Douglas Moore added:\n\nIt's a rare gift which sets Irving Berlin apart from all other contemporary songwriters. It is a gift which qualifies him, along with Stephen Foster, Walt Whitman, Vachel Lindsay and Carl Sandburg, as a great American minstrel. He has caught and immortalized in his songs what we say, what we think about, and what we believe.\n\nASCAP's records show that 25 of Berlin's songs reached the top of the charts and were re-recorded by dozens of famous singers over the years, such as Eddie Fisher, Al Jolson, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, Rosemary Clooney, Doris Day, Diana Ross, Nat King Cole and Ella Fitzgerald. In 1924, when Berlin was 36, his biography, \"The Story of Irving Berlin\", was being written by Alexander Woollcott. In a letter to Woollcott, Jerome Kern offered what one writer said \"may be the last word\" on the significance of Irving Berlin:\n\nIrving Berlin has no \"place\" in American music—he \"is\" American music. Emotionally, he honestly absorbs the vibrations emanating from the people, manners and life of his time and, in turn, gives these impressions back to the world—simplified, clarified and glorified.\n\nComposer George Gershwin (1898–1937) also tried to describe the importance of Berlin's compositions:\n\nI want to say at once that I frankly believe that Irving Berlin is the greatest songwriter that has ever lived... His songs are exquisite cameos of perfection, and each one of them is as beautiful as its neighbor. Irving Berlin remains, I think, America's Schubert. But apart from his genuine talent for song-writing, Irving Berlin has had a greater influence upon American music than any other one man.

It was a newspaper of record in the Soviet Union from 1917 until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.\n\nThe word \"izvestiya\" in Russian means \"delivered messages\", derived from the verb \"izveshchat\" (\"to inform\", \"to notify\"). In the context of newspapers it is usually translated as \"news\" or \"reports\".\n\nThe newspaper began as the \"News of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers Deputies\" on in Petrograd. Initially, the paper expressed Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary Party views.\n\nIn August 1917, it took the title \"News of the Central Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies\". By October 1917 it became \"News of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Working and Military Deputies\", and was eventually retitled \"News of the Soviets of People's Deputies\".\n\nAfter the Second All-Union Congress of Soviets, \"Izvestia\" became an official newspaper of the Soviet government (Central Executive Committee of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and Sovnarkom).\n\nDuring the Soviet period, while \"Pravda\" served as the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, \"Izvestia\" expressed the official views of the Soviet government as published by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. The full name was \"Izvestiya Sovetov Narodnykh Deputatov SSSR\" (in Russian, \"Известия Советов народных депутатов СССР\", the \"Reports of Soviets of Peoples' Deputies of the USSR\").\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, \"Izvestia\" now describes itself as a \"national\" newspaper of Russia. The newspaper was owned by a vast holding company of Vladimir Potanin which had close ties with the government. A controlling stake in \"Izvestia\" was purchased by state-owned Gazprom on 3 June 2005, and included in the Gazprom Media holding. According to the allegations of the Committee to Protect Journalists, Raf Shakirov, editor-in-chief of \"Izvestia\", was forced to resign because the government officials did not like the paper's coverage of the Beslan school hostage crisis. Other sources informed that Potanin had asked him to leave for fear the Kremlin would be riled by the explicit photographs of the massacre published by \"Izvestia\". As of 2005, the circulation of \"Izvestia\" was 240,967. Its 2007 circulation certified by TNS Gallup Media was 371,000 copies. Until his death on 1 October 2008, the chief artist was Boris Yefimov, the centenarian illustrator who had worked as Joseph Stalin's political cartoonist.\n\nIn 2008, Gazprom Media sold \"Izvestia\" to National Media Group. The newspaper was relaunched in D2 (broadsheet) format after that and adopted a new slogan (\"Making \"Izvestia\" [i.e., reports] from the news\"), as well as extended simultaneously its business coverage. The paper's old business section, Finansovye Izvestia (Finance Izvestia), was closed, and Marker Weekly was launched instead in September 2011, distributed with \"Izvestia\" on Mondays. The Friday appendix Nedelya (The Week), devoted to culture and leisure activities, was relaunched as well.\n\n"}

They were immediately sold in the gift store thereafter. The classic Jerry's Nugget playing cards were made from top of the line United States Playing Card Company card stock, that is not available today, which makes the cards much thinner than today's playing cards. The Playing Card Company also used a chemical finish then, which is also not available today due to environmental reasons.\n\nJerry's Nugget playing cards were printed in Cincinnati, Ohio, and then were driven to the North Las Vegas casino via trucks where they sat in storage for many years. The highly prized playing card eventually sold out in the summer of 1999. In 2000, a private collector purchased the remaining stock of 40,000 decks. Jerry's Nugget Casino does not have any plans to reprint them.\n\nAccording to Jerry's fans, there is something different about the cards that makes them perfect for different types of moves and flourishes.\n\nDai Vernon, Larry Jennings, Ed Marlo, Lee Asher, Frank Simon, Chris Kenner, Earl Nelson, Dan & Dave Buck, Wayne Houchin, and many other notable sleight of hand artists have been seen playing with Jerry's Nugget playing cards. The playing cards are stiff, hold their form, and are easily manipulated. Flourishers have taken a liking to these pasteboards as well.\n\nThe backs display fields of red or blue with an image of the oil derrick sign that graces the parking lot of the casino. The Jerry's Nugget oil derrick appears on the deck's joker as well.\n\nIn 2008, sophisticated counterfeiters super-saturated the market with fake Jerry's Nugget playing cards. Random videos started appearing on YouTube from upset purchasers. While the illegal versions look remarkably genuine, most playing card experts can tell the difference easily, as the fake decks were made from cheap cardboard. Some of the signs would be that of the box. The stamp on the legitimate version of the deck is blue and off center. Another sign would be on the flap, a long flap with no context on it. If you cut open the box and look inside there will be a printed year on the side. Last but not least would be the color, the originals are off white and lightly yellowed.\n\n\n"}

Initially all programmes were broadcast live but in December 1971 the Mongolian TV studios opened and another important step towards improving the quality of the images and enabling the pre-recording of documentaries and short films was taken. This in turn enabled the broadcast schedule to become much more varied and entertaining. Since the 1980s Mongolian National Broadcaster began working with a new generation of equipment made in Japan, France and Russia and this, along with a new TV centre being put into commission, made the transition to colour possible.\n\nUntil the mid-1980s programs were only watched by a small percentage of the population but with the help of radio relay lines reception was extended.

When she was 10, she moved to Norway with her family, but later relocated to Vietnam to pursue an entertainment career.\n\nIn 1999, Ngo returned to Vietnam where she participated in a beauty pageant organized by the magazine \"Women's World\", and finished as second runner-up. Following this initial success, she launched her modelling career in Vietnam as a model for magazines, calendars, and fashion collections. Soon after, she had her first acting role on the small screen in \"Huong De\", a short TV series on HTV Channel.\n\nIn 2002, Ngo transitioned into the music scene as a pop-dance singer with the help of producer Quoc Bao. She recorded the duet album called \"Vuon Tinh Nhan (Lovers' Garden)\" with established singer Tuan Hung.\n\nOne year later, again with the help of producer Quoc Bao, Ngo released her debut solo album, \"The Gioi Tro Choi (Playworld)\", on February 26.

Many countries have their own television rating system and countries' rating processes vary by local priorities. Programs are rated by the organization that manages the system, the broadcaster, or the content producers.\n\nA rating is usually set for each individual episode of a television series. The rating can change per episode, network, rerun, and country. As such, program ratings are usually not meaningful unless when and where the rating is used is mentioned.\n\nA comparison of current television content rating systems, showing age on the horizontal axis. Note however that the specific criteria used in assigning a classification can vary widely from one country to another. Thus a color code or age range cannot be directly compared from one country to another.\n\nKey:\n\n\nIn Argentina, the content rating system are identical to those used by the local film bureau.\n\nStarting from September 2010, it is compulsory for broadcasters to show the plaque Comienza el horario apto para todo público () and Finaliza el horario apto para todo público () at 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. or 10:30 p.m. respectively. In addition, the plaque Atención: Contenido no apto para niños, niñas y adolescentes () is shown before news broadcasts.\n\nA television content rating system for Armenia was introduced in June 2006 (first tested in Yerevan in January 2006). The Armenian ratings are as follows:\n\nRange specific\n\nAge specific\n\nCommercial television networks in Australia are required to comply with the Australian Commercial Television Code of Practice, which is governed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority with Free TV Australia mediating between the networks and the ACMA, as well as handling viewer complaints.\n\nClassifications for each program broadcast on TV, are decided upon by trained classification officers at each network.\n\nIf viewers believe a network has breached the TV Code of Practice (an incorrect classification have been given, for example), viewers can submit a complaint to Free TV Australia, who then submit that complaint to the network. If viewers are dissatisfied with the result, they may then refer their complaint to the ACMA for an investigation.\n\nThese time zones are further governed by the Australian Commercial Television Code of Practice, over and above the commercial Code of Practice. Both are similar to the G and PG classifications respectively in terms of allowable content, but are specifically targeted at children, whereas G specifies programming content that is suitable for all audiences, but may not necessarily be of interest to children.\nClassifications are intended to be equivalent to the Australian Classification Board (ACB) classifications of the same name. They're usually presented with the same shape and sometimes colour as their ACB counterparts.\n\nFrom December 2015, the ACMA introduced sweeping changes to the ratings system for commercial networks. Among them were allowing M and MA15+ programs to air an hour earlier then they were previously allowed, from 7:30 pm and 8:30 pm respectively, PG programs can air all day, dissolving the AV15+ classification, as well as changes to when adverts with higher classifications program can air.\n\nNetworks are still getting used to these changes and it will be a gradual change, with many programs already classified and scheduled on stations weeks ahead, in accordance with the old code. The Seven Network, Nine Network and Network Ten are continuing this trend.\nAdult \"Pay Per View\" only\n\nR18+ and X18+ restricted classifications are not permitted for free-to-air broadcast in Australia.\n\nMany R18+ movies on DVD/Blu-ray are often edited on Free TV/cable networks, to secure an MA15+ classification or lower. Some movies that were classified R18+ on DVD have since been aired on Australian TV with an MA15+ classification.\n\nThe two government-owned TV networks, ABC and SBS, are not bound by the same regulations as their commercial counterparts, and are instead each bound by their own Codes of Practice. The guidelines provided by these Codes are similar but not identical to the Codes of Practice for commercial stations. For example, SBS refers to the rating MAV15+ instead of AV15+, while ABC does not use the AV/MAV rating at all; instead programs rated MA15+ must not start before 9:30 p.m., instead of 9:00 p.m.. While the ABC recognizes the G rating, its code of practice does not require that it display its classification symbol on-air in respect to G-rated programming.\n\nPay television networks also have a different system to the free-to-air networks. In general, all content on pay TV must still be given one of the above ratings; however, there are not usually restrictions on the time of day any particular programming can be broadcast. There is no R18+ rating for pay TV, but its use is strictly limited to special interest channels. FOXTEL, a pay TV company, has a parental lock-out system which can be programmed by parents to stop children from seeing certain programs. In 2009, the system malfunctioned, allowing children access to violent TV shows and films. The restrictions on R18+ rated programming have been increased since then, and those programs can now only be shown on the two adult channels.\n\nConsumer advice is compulsory for all MA15+ and one-off programs. As well as very short series classified M or higher (such as feature films, miniseries and documentaries). Commercial networks have been providing consumer advice to all PG and M programs anyway. As of 13 April 2016, the Nine Network, the Seven Network and Network Ten along with regional networks Prime7, GWN7, WIN Television, NBN Television no longer uses full-screen and voiced-over boards, prior to the beginning of a program. Instead opting for a small text box in the bottom right-hand corner (Nine) and top left-hand corner (WIN, GWN7, Prime7, Seven & Ten), while ABC, Foxtel and SBS continue to use full-screen and voiced-over boards before the start of a program.\n\nConsumer advice takes the form of a full-screen written and verbal announcement at the start of the program, announcing the classification as well as listing the type & strength and/or frequency of any classifiable element. In addition when a program carries consumer advice, appropriate abbreviations are displayed along with the classification symbol after each commercial break. They also usually appear in programming guides, usually in lower case to distinguish from primary classifications. In general, these abbreviations are as follows:\n\n\nFor violence, coarse language and sex scenes, the intensity and/or frequency is mentioned in front of the consumer advice. These include: \"mild\", \"stylised\", \"some\", \"frequent\" or \"strong\". Example: \"strong sex scenes\".\n\nA television content rating system in Brazil was implemented following a consultation in 2006. Since then, the television networks themselves rate the shows, while the advisory rating () judges the content to guarantee that the rating is appropriate for that specific show. On broadcast networks, where the system is mandatory, the ratings are also translated in Brazilian Sign Language, and may also carry content descriptors. The icons must be shown at the start of each block of the show, and their respective promos.\n\nAll rating is advisory unlike films and home videos. The Brazilian content rating system utilizes age-specific classifications (with the exception of L-rated programming), and consist of the following:\n\nThe Canadian TV Classification System was created in late 1997 for English-language programs to use in conjunction with the V-chip (by this point, Canadian viewers were used to seeing ratings attached to American programming delivered via cable and over-the-air reception). The upper-right corner of symbols are shaped like the corner of a maple leaf, as is used in the national flag. The icons are intended to be shown once an hour lasting 15 seconds, although in the case of longer programs that do not start on the hour, some broadcasters show the rating at the start and at the top of each subsequent clock hour, while others show the rating at the start and again precisely one hour later. However, there are some networks like Global that only display the television rating at the beginning of the show. The icons are displayed in the upper-left corner and the size should be a minimum of 52 scan lines tall.\n\nAdditionally, should a program contain content potentially unsuitable for some viewers, such as violence, coarse language, or nudity, members of the self-regulating Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (which does not include the CBC, although it still uses such warnings) are required to air a disclaimer at the beginning of the program and at the end of each commercial break, advising viewer discretion (such disclaimers are only required for the first hour if airing after 9:00 p.m.). This disclaimer is technically required even if the final commercial break comes immediately before the closing credits, and some (but not all) channels in fact observe this.\n\nNotably, the television rating given may depend on the level of cable and satellite, or if the program is broadcast over-the-air. Also, television ratings are generally considered more restrictive than movie ratings.\n\nThe Canadian rating system is as follows:\n\nFrench-language broadcasters use the Régie du cinéma film rating system for television programming. Logo may or may not appear on screen after every commercial depending on the TV channel.\n\nThe () devised a content rating system in 1993.\n\n\n\nSince 1997, Colombian television networks are required to specify programs within dubbed \"family\" and \"adult\" fringes, and must display a notice signifying the audience, both visually and in narration, the minimum age required to watch the program, if it contains sexual or violent content, and if parental company is needed at the beginning of every program. The networks must also air an 'institutional message' daily at 21:00, inviting children 12 years of age or less to \"not to stay exposed to contents which have no essentially child[-oriented] nature.\" A message must be broadcast at 22:10, Monday through Friday, (22:30 Saturdays and Sundays) explaining to viewers that the adult fringe has started. Most networks opt to display a scrolling text message instead.\n\nThe ratings are as follows:\n\nPornography is prohibited from being transmitted over the air in Colombia, even in the adult fringes.\n\nIn Croatia, television networks show the rating during the broadcast. The Hrvatska Radiotelevizija (Croatian Radiotelevision) channels, RTL Televizija, RTL 2, Nova TV and Doma TV all display warnings before a broadcast not meant for a general audience. Broadcasts meant for all audiences do not have a rating. With that in mind, the rating system is the following:\n\n\nArticle 65 of the \"Communications Law\" of Ecuador presents the following classification:\n\nThe classification to which belongs each program will be arranged by the \"Consejo de Regulación y Desarrollo de la Información y Comunicación\" (Regulatory and Development Council of Information and Communication) depending on the parameters which are considered relevant.\n\nA content rating system were introduced to Finland television broadcasting in 2004. The initial ratings system for television programs shown on Finnish television channels consist of the following:\nIf a program is classified as 'K16' or 'K18', a notification must be shown before broadcast.\n\nA content rating system in French is regulated by Conseil Supérieur de l'Audiovisuel (CSA). Each rating icon is translucent and, as of November 2012, is shown for the whole duration of the show.\n\nThere initially was no ratings system for French television. In March 1961, following the broadcast of a film where a female nude was briefly visible, the \"white square\" was introduced. A white square, replaced by a white rectangle in 1964, was displayed in the corner of the screen. An off-screen voice warned at the beginning of the program that it was unsuitable for all audiences. This system continued until 1996 when the Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel replaced it with a system of five pictograms, indicating the suitability of the program. This system was replaced by the current system on 18 November 2002.\n\nIn Germany every broadcaster has to show a disclaimer displaying the sentence \"Die nachfolgende Sendung ist für Zuschauer unter 16/18 Jahren nicht geeignet\" before transmission if the program contains potentially offensive content. This roughly translates to \"The following program is not suitable for viewers under 16/18\". The Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle Fernsehen(FSF) checks many shows in private television.\n\nA content rating system in Greece was devised in 2000. The system has five ratings, with each rating being represented by a different shape on a different-coloured background. The color-coded ratings are compulsory, and are displayed and verbally announced at the beginning of each broadcast. These provisions are enforced by the Greek National Council for Radio and Television (ESR).\n\nThe Hong Kong television rating system is since by generic code of television programs standard of the Broadcasting Ordinance (Cap.562) on December 11, 1995. The current ratings are:\n\nPrograms that are classified as either 'PG' or 'M' should not be broadcast between 4:00 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. every day, as this is a watershed devised for family viewing.\n\nThe Hungarian content rating system has changed frequently. The ratings of the programs broadcast often caused legal interferences, since the radio and television authorities have stricter guidelines about age appropriate rating categories for programs. If a program is not marked with the television authority's choice of rating symbol, the airing channel often has to pay large penalties to Hungarian authorities.\n\nIn 2002, a new rating system was devised. Ranking programs and displaying the rating symbols became compulsory on every Hungarian television network. The new rating system caused trouble within these networks, because the channels were required to display the ranking symbols during the entire duration of their programs. The symbols were distracting to viewers, and networks feared that their constant presence could damage the television screen. Because of the complaints, the television authority allowed channels to choose to show the rating symbols on the left or on the right side of the screen. Later, channels were also allowed to increase the transparency of the symbols.\n\nIn the current system there are five rating categories:\n\nSimilar ratings also apply to films shown in cinemas, however unlike in other countries a viewer cannot be denied access from entering a screening if they are not the age of the rating.\n\nIn February 2013, in the wake of controversy over suspension of exhibition of the film, \"Vishwaroopam\", the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting constituted a panel under the Chairmanship of Justice (Retd.) Mukul Mudgal to examine issues of film certification under the Cinematograph Act 1952. One of the terms of reference for the committee is to examine \"the requirement of special categories of certification for the purposes of broadcasting on television channels and radio stations.\" But, the committee had not made any recommendations on this important matter.\n\nThe current classifications of films in India are as follows:\n\nIndonesian Broadcasting Commission (KPI) regulate broadcast television content that classifies television program into several classifications:\n\nIn Malaysia, a television rating system was revised in January 2012. Ratings are shown before the program starts.\n\nThe classifications are as follows:\n\nThe classification system of television programs in Mexico is almost equivalent to that of the movie rating system of the country, and consists of the following:\n\nThe television rating system in the Netherlands was created in 2001 by the \"Dutch Institute for the Classification of Audiovisual Media\" (NICAM) and is known as Kijkwijzer (ViewingGuide or WatchWiser). The same rating systems are used for both television programs and films, and serve partly as guidelines (Programs with the classification 12 years may only be broadcast from 8pm and with the classification 16 years from 10pm. Cinemas and theaters in the country cannot provide films with the classification 16 years to people under the age of 16). Animated versions of the icons used are also utilized in visual mediums. They are the same as Dutch film ratings. The system is also used for DVDs in Belgium and selectively used on television broadcasts in Flanders.\n\nThe following icons are in use for age rating:\n\nThere are also six descriptor icons used:\n\nNew Zealand has two separate content rating systems, one for free-to-air channels and one for pay TV services.\n\nNew Zealand's free-to-air TV content rating system has been in place since 1989 and is based on the system Australia was using from the early 1980s until 1993. There are three classifications:\n\nG (General Programs): These exclude material likely to harm children under 14 and can screen at any time. Programs may not necessarily be designed for younger viewers, but must not contain material likely to cause them undue distress or discomfort.\n\nPGR (Parental Guidance Recommended): Programs more suited to more mature viewers. These are not necessarily unsuitable for children (defined as under 14), but viewer discretion is advised, and parents and guardians are encouraged to supervise younger viewers. Programs rated PGR can screen between 9 a.m. – 4 p.m. and between 7 p.m. – 6 a.m.\n\nAO (Adults Only): AO programs contain material of an adult nature handled in such a way that it is unsuitable for children. Such programs are directed primarily at a mature audience and can screen between noon and 3pm on a school day (except during school and public holidays as designated by the Ministry of Education), and between 8:30 p.m. – 5:00 a.m. A special sub-class of this rating, denoted \"AO 9:30 p.m. or later\", is reserved for programs with a \"greater degree of sexual activity, potentially offensive language, realistic violence, sexual violence, or horrific encounters\" and are considered unsuitable for viewing before that time. www.bsa.govt.nz.\n\nThe rating for each program is shown at the start and after each commercial break. Some PGR programs and most AO programs have an advisory before the program begins to advise of any specific content that could offend viewers such as language, nudity, sex and violence.\n\nThe system for pay television is as follows:\n\nAny program of any rating can air at any time, but care should be taken to observe the following guidelines (as per the Broadcasting Codes of Practice):\n\nA TV-content rating system was introduced in Norway in July 2015. Television broadcasters are obliged to classify their programmes in the following age categories: A (all ages), 6 years, 9 years, 12 years, 15 years or 18 years. The classification must be based on the guidelines made by The Norwegian Media Authority. Programmes in the different age categories must be transmitted according to the following time schedule during the day:\n\nTelevision broadcasters shall specify the age limit acoustically before the programme starts or clearly mark the programme with an age limit throughout its duration. Television broadcasters shall also specify the age limit in programme schedules and electronic programme guides.\n\nThe age categories are also applicable to other platforms such as Video on demand-services, videogrammes (DVD, Blu-Ray) and cinema theatres.\n\nThe age rating system in Peru was introduced in 2005 by the then-President Alejandro Toledo and came into force for both radio and television broadcasts. Currently, the only free-to-air channels advising their audiences about the rating system are ATV, NexTV and La Tele, since most channels adopted their own system since 2009, starting with América Televisión.\n\nThe ratings for television programs are available on some Peruvian channels. The rating system used in Peru is listed below.\n\nIn the Philippines, the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board, commonly known as MTRCB, implements and regulates local television content rating systems. In November 1995, the MTRCB has implemented only two television ratings: \"General Patronage\" and \"Parental Guidance\", in which these advisories are simply written on the upper left side or at the lower right side of the television screen.\n\nOn 6 October 2011, in order to encourage parents to supervise and be responsible with their children in watching television, the MTRCB revamped its rating system, implementing a three-tiered system:\n\nThe new ratings was originally to have been a four-tiered system, composed of G (General Patronage), PG (Parental Guidance), SPG (Strong Parental Guidance), and M, but some time before the implementation of the new system, the \"M\" rating was dropped.\n\nThe new ratings system is similar to the old one, but the look and the ratings themselves was completely revamped. The new system consists of a new full-screen advisory of the program's rating which is played before every program, whatever the rating of such program is, except in the case of programs with SPG rating, wherein the rating must be aired twice (before the program and after a commercial break somewhere in the middle of the program). A rating logo then appears at the bottom right of the screen during a program if it was rated as such. Sometimes, when annotations are to be put and it takes the place of the logo, then it has to be put on the upper left side of the screen, opposite the logo of the TV station.\n\nOn 9 February 2012, the SPG rating was implemented, which utilizes at least one of the following content descriptors: T for \"tema\" (themes), L for \"lengguwahe\" (language), V for \"karahasan\" (violence), S for \"sekswal\" (sex), H for \"katatakutan\" (horror) and D for \"droga\" (drugs). The rating was first broadcast on the film \"Cinco\" which was aired in ABS-CBN, where it had its old advisory.\n\nBefore 2000, Poland did not have any uniform classification system for television programs. Some stations, however, applied their own system of signs: in front of the selected films TVP board applied the \"Adult only\" or \"Film for adult audiences only\". In Canal+ before the film to show in chart with key Canal+ in the appropriate color (green, yellow, red). Until 27 February 2000, TVN decided to mark the so-called \"adult movies\" with a pulsating red 18+ logo. On 1 March 2000, an agreement was reached with Polish television broadcasters as \"Friendly media\" in order to introduce a uniform system of classification of television programs. Nine television broadcasters - TVP, Polsat, TVN, Nasza TV, Canal+, Wizja TV, Polish Cable Television and TV Niepokalanow - had signed the agreement.\n\nThe current Polish television rating system was introduced on 15 August 2005 and consists of five icons. On 28 August 2011 changed the appearance of the characters:\n\nFor a long time, the only existing regulation on Portuguese television was that programs with potentially shocking or harmful content could air only between 10:30pm and 6am and with a red circular marker on the top-right corner of the screen in rated 16.\n\nIn 2006, all free-to-air networks decided to complement this rule with a shared, more detailed rating system for TV shows:\n\nThese logos must be shown during 10 seconds in the beginning of any program and after every break. If a program is rated 16, it can only be broadcast between 10:30pm and 6am.\n\nThe Romanian content rating system has changed frequently. The ratings of the programs broadcast often caused legal interferences, since the radio and television authorities have stricter guidelines about age appropriate rating categories for programs. If a program is not marked with the television authority's choice of rating symbol, the airing channel often has to pay large penalties to Romanian authorities, except with 24h all-news channels, 24h advertising channels (teleshopping), pay television or pay-per-view channels (like Eurosport, HBO, etc.) and foreign broadcasting TV-channels (like TV5Monde, Deutsche Welle, arte, etc.) that are subjected to foreign audio-visual regulations from their country of origin.\n\nIn 2002, a new rating system was devised. Ranking programs and displaying the rating symbols became compulsory on every Romanian television network. The new rating system caused trouble within these networks, because the channels were required to display the ranking symbols during the entire duration of their programs. The symbols were distracting to viewers, and networks feared that their constant presence could damage the television screen. Because of the complaints, the television authority allowed channels to choose to show the rating symbols on the left or on the right side of the screen. Later, channels were also allowed to increase the transparency of the symbols.\n\nIn the current system there are five rating categories:\n\nThe rating system for programs and films shown on Russian television:\nThese logos are shown in the beginning of the program and after every break.\n\nSingapore has adopted the use of TV Ratings from 15 July 2011. They consist of PG and PG13 ratings for Free-to-Air TV and NC16 and M18 ratings in addition to the PG and PG13 ratings for Pay TV channels. For Free-to-Air TV, the shows rated PG may be aired anytime while PG13 should air between 10pm to 6am. For Pay TV, PG13 rated programs can be shown anytime. Before the rated program starts the TV channels will show a notification. Currently, only StarHub TV's and Mio TV's self-packaged non-regional Pay TV channels ( e.g. StarHub TV's E City and Sensasi and Mio TV's FashionTV HD and FashionTV HD On Demand, both of which features modeling nudity in certain programs ) are enabled to carry NC16 and M18 rated content. FashionTV is also Singapore's first official M18 rated channel. M18 rated programs can only be telecasted from 10pm onwards to 6am on Pay TV. Regional channels like Fox Life, Fox Movies and HBO Asia are unable to carry Media Development Authority's film ratings as they are targeted at the same region (a certain group of Asia territories), which results in programs being subjected to external censorship of a much harsher nature outside Singapore territorial control. Only Video on Demand (VOD) Pay TV services are allowed to carry R21 content currently. G-rated programs are not required to show a notification for any channel.\n\nSlovakian government accepted a law in 2001, in which television stations are required to display one of the following icons:\n\nSlovenian government accepted a law in 2004, in which television stations are required to play a warning before a program and display one of the following icons:\n\nSouth African ratings are issued and certified by the Film and Publication Board, whilst the National Broadcasting Commission regulates the various films and programs. All television stations, cinemas and distributors of DVD, video and computer games must display the following signage:\n\nAdditional symbols:\n\nThe South Korean television rating system has been in force since 2000, and it started with only four classifications which are All, 7, 13 and 19. In February 2001, all programs except domestic dramas (which had been enforced since November 2002) has required to have a rating system. In 2007, rating 13 was changed into 12 and a new rating, 15 is introduced. Most programs have to be rated, except the \"exempt\" rating below. Even if it qualifies for being exempt, a broadcaster may apply a rating.\n\n\nRating icons may be transparent, and can be positioned either on the upper-left or upper-right corner of the screen.

{"id": "37416862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37416862", "title": "The Kiralfy Brothers", "text": "The Kiralfy Brothers\n\nImre Kirafly and Bolossy Kiralfy were highly influential burlesque and spectacle producers in Europe and the United States toward the end of the 19th century. The brothers paved the way for many of our modern day spectacles. With backgrounds in music and dance, these performers turned producers dazzled New York City with theatrical wonders. The brothers had a long and successful partnership and even continued to have success in their individual careers. From folk dancing in Europe to directing and producing in the United States, the Kiralfys spent their lives astounding audiences with unseen visual phenomenon and were never afraid to push the boundaries earning them a special place in entertainment history.\n\nThe Kiralfy Brothers, Imre (1845-1919) and Bolossy (1848-1932), were the eldest of seven siblings born in the 1840s in Budapest during the Hungarian Revolution, in which their father, Jacob Königsbaum, was ruined. When they were young children, Imre and Bolossy began to teach themselves to dance. They continued for years until their father caught them and promptly enrolled them in dance classes. Soon, they were dancing at large venues such as the Hungarian Circus. There the brothers first performed under the name “Kiralfy” instead of their family name of Königsbaum; the boys’ father changed their name to prevent them from being recognized as the sons of a revolutionary. They were never recognized, though over the years, there were a number of close encounters with Austrian police, during many of which their father was nearly arrested. Jacob Königsbaum and their mother, Anna (Rosa) Weisberger, were highly supportive of their sons’ career. They gave up their clothing business to take the brothers on tour through Europe. For many years, the family continued to travel, touring all through both Eastern and Western Europe, while the three of the four younger siblings went to school and learned dance. The Kiralfy family motto was “All the World’s a Stage.” Eventually, their sisters Haniola, Emile and Katie, as well as their youngest brother Arnold joined Imre and Bolossy in the dance industry. Only their brother Ronald was uninterested in dance.\n\nAs teenagers in the 1860s, Bolossy and Imre travelled to Paris, where they were immediately taken with theatrical spectacle. Bolossy believes he first developed his theory of theatre in the city:\nReal musical theatre had to be popular theatre, attracting an audience from all segments of society. It had to embody in logical form all aspects of the theatre – music, lyrics, dance and drama – in a production that was usually greater than the sum of its parts. It had to have a meaningful story with a universal theme, and it had to have a hero or heroine with whom the audience could sympathize. \nImre and Bolossy both trained at the Opera Ballet but they refused to become permanent performers. Bolossy reflects on his training in Paris:\nThere is no question that in Paris I acquired my training, not only in the finest Ballet technique from Monsieur Barres, but in the areas of production and management. The presentations at the Theatre Francais taught me dramatic staging. My experience at the Theatre de la Porte-Saint-Martin and at the Chatelet gave me the ability to produce big spectacular numbers. At the Opera I learned the choreography that would help me to plan my lavish musical productions. And it was there that my encounters with the artists proved how exciting and challenging the work of producers and directors could be.\nBolossy Kiralfy was 26 when he retired as a performer and began the second phase of his career where he focused on producing and choreographing. He adapted European productions to the United States. The Kiralfy Brothers had a 13-year-long producing partnership. According to Bolossy Kiralfy, “The American public not only became educated of our large dance extravaganzas, they demanded them in all musical productions.” \n\nWhen they travelled to New York City in May 1869, the Kiralfy Brothers may already have envisioned how to produce their ideas of spectacle on stage. For four years, the family continued to tour as dancers, until eventually being contracted by Niblo's Garden, just after the theatre’s immense success with \"The Black Crook\". Their first foray into the production side of theatre came in 1871, with the pantomime \"Humpty Dumpty\" at the Olympic, in which the “Kiralfy Troupe,” as they had come to be known, were performing. The reviewers of the production praised both the dancing and the scenery greatly, declaring the latter to be “of exceptional beauty”. This “exceptional beauty” would become a common theme in reviews of the Kiralfy Brothers' productions.\n\nThe Black Crook\nIn August 1873, the brothers first produced their own musical spectacle, a revival of \"The Black Crook\" at Niblo's Garden. They added musical numbers, improved the costumes (beyond exposing the legs of the actresses), and strengthened the dance numbers. According to Bolossy Kiralfy, their revival was an immense success, playing over one hundred performances before going on tour and breaking Niblo's Garden's record number of performances of a revival. Their production, featuring actors such as George Atkins, E.K. Collier, and W. Martin, as well as the Kiralfy sisters’ dancing talents, was later revived from November 1874 to January 1875. With this production, the brothers achieved their goal of making popular theatre, and they made a strong effort to elevate \"The Black Crook\" into a slightly higher class of theatre.\n\nThe Deluge, or Paradise Lost\n\nThe next year, they imported the French spectacle \"The Deluge\" to Niblo's Garden, and were noted for producing rain on stage. \"The Deluge\", otherwise known as \"Paradise Lost,\" opened Niblo's Garden's 1874-1875 season, on September 4, 1874. This production was called a “delectability” by the historian George Odell. Its players included actresses Julia Seamen, Lillie McDonald and Katie New, as well as the Kiralfy Sisters as dancers. \"The Deluge\" ran until November 14, 1874 and a competing theater company, Bryant's Minstrels, opened their own \"The Deluge\" on the same day. Odell said it brought “a veritable flood-tide of success”. When one of the many revivals of the Kiralfy Brothers’ production was brought to the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia in April 1879, reviewers praised the ballet and scenery, while essentially ignoring the acting. One reviewer comments that the sets of “Pandemonium, the Garden of Eden, and the Temple of Enoch were wonderful to behold, and were master-pieces of scenic painting,” and goes on to note that, because the piece was under the direction of the Kiralfys, it would “undoubtedly draw full houses”. \"The Deluge\" is a perfect example of the Kiralfys’ mastery of the key concepts of burlesque; the plot was weak but the gorgeous set, astonishing special effects, and beautiful girls served well to cover this up.\n\nAround the World in Eighty Days\n\nOn August 28, 1875, the Kiralfy Brothers put up, “in spectacular style,” \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" at the New York Academy of Music. According to Bolossy Kiralfy, their goal with the production was to “convert American theatre audiences into enthusiasts for the French style of musical spectacle” which so inspired the brothers. \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" based on the Jules Verne novel and adapted for the stage by Michael d’Ennery, was another Parisian import. To mount the show in the United States, the brothers re-created the scenery and costumes from the Paris production as precisely as possible, and hired all the cast and crew members, except for the principal speaking roles, from the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin, where the original production was performed. In terms of special effects, the brothers rented an elephant for $150 per week, brought a steam engine from Europe to run automation, and created a new stage deck for the Academy of Music to accommodate for a sinking steam ship. Audiences loved the depictions of foreign attractions such as the Suez Canal, Calcutta, and the Taj Mahal. The Kiralfys were immediately praised for their use of pastel backgrounds which please the eye but do not distract from performance. They were also some of the first American producers to utilize realistic set design. For example, their trees looked like actual trees and not theatrical renditions of trees. They convinced Jules Verne to add a bit about a hot air balloon to the already-extensive adventures of Phileas Fogg and his companions so that the Kiralfys could put a real helium balloon onstage to be operated by wires. Aside from adding special effects, few changes were made to the Paris production. They added the \"Around the World Waltz\" and a curtain for scene changes that was in the shape of a fan. The Kiralfy production was larger than the Paris production, having a cast of 35 principal actors, a ballet corps, and over 200 ensemble members.\n\"Around the World in Eighty Days\" opened at the Academy of Music, after a legal challenge due to another New York troupe trying to mount the same Paris production, and it was a major hit. The special effects and exciting story attracted large audiences consistently. It became so popular that the President of the United States attended a performance. President Ulysses S. Grant, who attended a performance on September 17, 1875 with Secretary George M. Robeson, General Orville E. Babcock, and former-Attorney General George Henry Williams, “seemed to be much pleased with the brilliant spectacle”. After the production closed in October at the Academy of Music, it went on tour to the outer boroughs for two weeks, until it reached the Brooklyn Academy of Music, during Christmas week in 1875. Yet, like \"The Deluge\", this Kiralfy Brothers production did not end here. \nThe first of a long line of expansive revivals of \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" opened again at Niblo's Garden on January 22, 1877. It was presented at Niblo's Garden nine times, together with a series of very successful tours and revivals between 1881 and 1892 throughout New York City and the United States. Some of the houses for \"Around the World\" included Haverly’s Theatre in Brooklyn, the Novelty Theatre in Brooklyn, and the Grand Opera House, the Windsor Theatre, and the Amphion Academy. For the audience and the producers, much of the appeal in such frequent productions lay in the fluidity of the plot, which allowed many opportunities for additions to the story, scenery and dance. The fantastic situations Phileas Fogg and company get into on their trip around the world, allow for inserts and interpretation. Due to their success with this work, the brothers bought a property at 39 Washington Square, which they used for offices and residence until 1921.\n\nExcelsior\n\nThe Kiralfy Brothers had a 13-year long producing partnership. In 1887, Imre and Bolossy Kiralfy had a falling out and the firm disbanded, driving Bolossy and Imre to produce outdoor spectacles. Neither publicly addressed the split, although, Bolossy intimated that his brother was making business deals behind his back. Upon their split, Bolossy continued to work in fantasy and fable whereas Imre pressed on with progressive era productions filled with science, technology, and machinery.\n\nImre Kiralfy after the split\n\nImre Kiralfy’s \"The Fall of Rome\" was produced on Staten Island with 2,000 performers, a grand number at the time. In 1892, to mark the 400th anniversary of Columbus' \"founding\" of America, he produced \"Columbus and the Discovery of America\" at the Madison Square Garden Theatre. It was later featured at the Auditorium Theatre at the Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition. Imre Kiralfy also premiered his show \"America\" at the Chicago World’s Fair which was picked up by the Metropolitan Opera House in 1893. \"Life magazine\" in quoted as response to the production “Kiralfy out-Kiralfy’s himself” Imre Kiralfy then moved to England where he created even larger spectacles. The twenty-four acre Earl's Court Exhibition Centre grounds were rebuilt in 1894 by Imre Kiralfy in a Mughal Indian style. \"The Empire of India Exhibition\" opened the site in 1895, and was the first of a series of annual exhibitions there, which drew heavily on the abundance of transport links in the area to attract a mass audience. Highlights of the site included the two-storey Empress Hall, built for Kiralfy in Fulham which could seat 6,000 viewers for his spectaculars, and the 300-feet high Great Wheel whose forty carriages could each accommodate thirty people. Imre Kiralfy became a British citizen in 1901. The renowned producer died on April 28, 1919 at age 74 in Brighton, England.\n\nBolossy Kiralfy after the split\n\nDuring his time alone, Blossy Kiralfy focused a lot on outdoor theatre. In London he created \"Venice in London\", which included a lake and water canals. A few years later, in Portland, Oregon, he produced \"Carnival in Venice\". According to Bolossy, this production in Portland required “a huge open air theatre with a particularly broad canal connected to a lake. The four hundred foot stage was the largest ever constructed in the Northwest and allowed me to put two hundred performers in action in one scene. I could still hide myself and cruise the show in a gondola to evaluate the performance.” \nIn 1888, Bolossy returned from his trip to Europe and brought two new spectacles to America, \"Mathias Sandorf\" and \"Antiope\". \"Mathias Sandorf\" is a play by Jules Verne. Bolossy purchased the play itself along with the scenery, costumes and effects used in the original production. Kiralfy had several interviews with Jules Verne and William Busnach to improve certain scenes and adapt them for American audiences. Kiralfy also introduced two new ballets in this production; one of them is called \"America\" and required 120 performers; the other one is called \"The Fete of Storks\" and required no less than 200 performers. In this production, Kiralfy included performers like the James troupe of eccentric games, and Alexandrov Brothers, the famous Russian musical clowns.\nThe other production that Kiralfy brought was the new ballet \"Antiope\" which opened at London first. Kiralfy promised this ballet to be more brilliant and effective than the \"Excelsior\", which was claimed to be best ballet of the time. The production featured 350 magnificent costumes designed by Wilhelm}. Kiralfy introduced some novel features in this production, one of which was an eccentric boat moving about on real water.\nBolossy Kiralfy died in 1932 at the age of 84 in New York City.\n"}

It was the first of 11 musicals that featured the songs of Dietz and Schwartz. The revue opened on Broadway in 1929.\n\nThe show grew out of a number of Sunday evening variety shows co-produced by Tom Weatherly with James Pond at the\nSelwyn Theatre . Weatherly said that they were \"really nothing more than high-class vaudeville shows but they were far more artistic than the Sunday night variety programs being offered at the Winter Garden.\"\n\n\"This was the first American revue to give wit precedence over spectacle.\" Fred Allen (who had been a vaudeville headliner as a juggler and ventriloquist) \"won acclaim with his sardonic banter\", \"torch singer Libby Hollman smoldered.\" Clifton Webb, the debonair star, \"wanted a number that was more perverse, a number he could deliver all alone in full-dress suit and a spotlight...a lyric with suave romantic frustration.\" The song was \"I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan\", which was used again in the 1953 MGM musical \"The Band Wagon\". The song \"Hammacher Schlemmer, I Love You\" was an \"open-hearted tribute\" to the hardware store.\n\nAccording to Kay Green, the funniest sketch was George S. Kaufman's \"The Still Alarm\" which concerns nonchalant hotel guests Webb and Fred Allen, completely oblivious to being in a raging fire. The most \"dramatic scene was the torrid dance Clifton Webb and Libby Holman performed after Miss Holman moaned \"Moanin' Low\" in a squalid Harlem tenement.\" Smith and Litton described another act: \"Fred Allen's monologues before the curtain held the audience transfixed, especially one about a little boy who shot both parents in order to be entitled to go to the orphans' picnic.\"\n\nKen Bloom wrote: \"\"The Little Show\" was one of the first intimate revues that proved to audiences that all the Ziegfeldian trappings were not necessary for the enjoyment of a revue.\"\n\nProduced by William A. Brady, Jr. and Dwight Deere Wiman, in association with Tom Weatherly, the production opened on April 30, 1929 at the Music Box Theatre for a total of 321 performances. The revue was directed by Wiman, choreographed by Danny Dare, and had scenic design by Jo Mielziner. The cast included Fred Allen, Libby Holman, John McCauley, Romney Brent, and Clifton Webb.\n\nSources: Steven Suskin for songs marked ≠ Kay Green for songs marked ‡;Chuck Denison, \"Can’t We Be Friends?\";\"Billboard\" for songs marked √;Ruth Benjamin and Arthur Rosenblatt for song marked ≈\n\n\n\n"}

The plot, set in Venice in the mid 15th century, is loosely based on the true story of the downfall of doge Francesco Foscari and his son Jacopo. Byron's play formed the basis of Verdi's opera \"I due Foscari\".\n\nJacopo Foscari, son of the Doge of Venice, has twice been exiled, once for corruption and once for complicity in the murder of Donato, a member of the Council of Ten. He has been recalled from his second exile to answer the capital charge of treason, and as the play opens he is between sessions of interrogation on the rack. The Council decide to sentence him to a third exile, this time perpetual, rather than to death. His father Doge Francesco Foscari signs the sentence of exile, though his spirit is broken by this new disgrace. Jacopo's patriotic spirit cannot brook such a sentence, he longs to die, and he duly does die of a broken heart. The Council of Ten orders the Doge to abdicate, and, as the bells begin to toll to signify the election of a new Doge, the old one falls and dies.\n\nByron wrote \"The Two Foscari\" in Ravenna in less than a month, between 12 June and 9 July 1821. It was published by John Murray on 19 December 1821 in the same volume as his \"Sardanapalus\" and \"Cain\". Byron originally intended to dedicate \"The Two Foscari\" to his friend Sir Walter Scott, but in the event he transferred that dedication to \"Cain\" and left \"Foscari\" without one. He added an appendix to \"The Two Foscari\" in which he launched a stinging attack on what he considered the hypocrisies of the Poet Laureate, Robert Southey. Southey responded in a letter to a London newspaper in which he dared Byron to attack him again. Byron initially wanted to challenge Southey to a duel, but then turned instead to poetry and wrote his stinging satire \"The Vision of Judgment\".\n\nVerdi's opera \"I due Foscari\", with a libretto by Francesco Maria Piave, was based on Byron's play. It also inspired two paintings, \"Les deux Foscari\" by Delacroix, and \"L'ultimo abboccamento di Jacopo Foscari con la propria famiglia prima di partire per l'esilio cui era stato condannato\" by Francesco Hayez.\n\n"}

It was released March 31, 2000 in the West. The game was met with moderate success; however, it got mild recognition and audience when it was published as a demo in several gaming magazines.\n\nThe gameplay is set in a fictional medieval age. The game is a basic real time strategy game that resembles the gameplay of the \"Age of Empires\" series. The basic goal is to conquer the neighbouring kingdoms and destroy all traces of them, or destroy their castles, depending on the selected playing mode. There are many different buildings and characters player can produce, each depending on which of the three races the player chooses to play as: European, Asian or Arabian. The main differences are the types of special buildings and the types of troops available.\n\nThere are four types of resources a player has to gather: food, wood, stone and gold. Food can be gathered by harvesting crops, milking cows or killing them for meat, as well as fishing if the map has lakes or rivers. Wood is gathered by chopping down trees, and gold and stone are gathered by mining. All units have health (hit points) but sorcerers also have mana which gradually regenerates when used to cast spells or summon creatures.\n\nThe main buildings that can be constructed by all three races are houses, farms, blacksmiths, workshops, barracks, stables, towers, walls, gates and inns. The players usually starts the game with a castle and a few peasants. All types of resources can be carried to the castle. Building houses increases the population limit. Farms can be used to produce cows and also as a place to gather food. Stables are required for some types of mounted soldiers, and blacksmiths provide various improvements to units' armour and fighting skills. Workshops are used to build siege machines. Towers are used for defence. Inns are the place where the player can exchange resources and later hire mercenaries and heroes. Docks can be built to fishing and travelling across the sea.\n\nThere are a number of elite buildings that are specific for each of the three races. For example, Europeans can build a cathedral, Asians a Shaolin monastery and Arabians a mosque. Another important building is the magician's tower where the player can create sorcerers who can summon different creatures - giants and bats (Europeans), genies (Arabians) and dragons (Asians). There are also many other buildings that create units unique to the race the player is playing.\n\nThere is also a campaign option for single players in which the player must complete specific goals, such as destroying an enemy force, or protecting a citadel from attack. The campaign has a total of 20 missions.\n\nThe game also includes a map editor where players can create their own maps to play on with strategically placed rivers, forests, and resources to use to build their armies with. The game is best known for the first ever implementation of a full experience system for every unit in a RTS game. The game doesn't have the commonly known system of \"Warcraft III\" for heroes but still every unit has the potential to reach level twelve and thus gaining a heroic status. There is no limit of the \"hero\" units a player can have, as long as they can keep them alive.\n\nThe game was considered by Linux Game Publishing to be ported to Linux, it was however rejected due to concerns within the company about its gameplay and after hearing negative comments about the game from the Linux gaming community.\n\nThe kingdom of Keanor is under attack by dark forces and much lie in ruins. The old king has died and the son Prince Sartor's whereabouts are unknown.\n\nSartor is raised as a lumberjack in a village, unaware of his royal lineage as Prince. One day, mercenaries seeking Sartor raid the village, killing his uncle. A wizard named Ghiron arrives in time and saves him, revealing his royal lineage and promises to help restore the kingdom to its previous glory. Ghiron takes him to find allies, such as his father's guard captain Woolin. They save the capitol from being completely destroyed. The trio seek more and more allies, growing enough to be confident in the final battle. Having enough resources, they lead massive armies against the Messiah of Evil, the manifestation of evil on Earth.\n\nSartor slowly gains allies. He travels far and wide to find people. He finds allies in the Asians on a far northern continent and finds favor when he kills their old time foes. Sartor soon finds Arabian allies on a far continent. He gets taken prisoner one time and his allies break him out of his imprisonment. Eventually, he gets the confidence and his allies to find the final allies.\n\nThen the now-King Sartor leads his army to defeat the Messiah of Evil and his city in one large battle. In the end, he recognizes that evil shall always remain.\n\n\"Tzar\" became a hit in Spain, with sales of 50,000 units in the region by November 2000.\n"}

Before that time, protests also occurred when a number of songs were used as unofficial national anthems, including \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\" and \"Hail, Columbia\".\n\nIn 1892, three men, including a friend of Ida B. Wells, were lynched by a white mob while in police custody in Memphis, Tennessee, in an event known as the Peoples Grocery lynching. The act sparked a national outcry. At a meeting of one thousand people at Bethel A. M. E. Church, Reverend W. Gaines' call for the crowd to sing the then \"de facto\" national anthem, \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\", but the call was refused, one member of the audience declaring, \"I don't want to sing that song until this country is what it claims to be, 'sweet land of liberty'\". The Reverend substituted the Civil War-era song about the abolitionist martyr, \"John Brown's Body\". Well's husband, Ferdinand L. Barnett, closed the meeting appealing for calm and a careful response, but also expressing great frustration and concern that the violence against blacks may one day lead to reprisals.\n\nRefusal to stand during the national anthem became a widespread form of protest during World War I. In some cases, this was related to protest of conscription. It was also associated with support for Socialism, Bolshevism, or Communism. In one case, supporters of the Communism refused to stand during the song at a trial of Emma Goldman. The act of protest was very controversial, and many people were highly offended, so that even accidentally remaining seated could result in violence.\n\nProtests during the anthem continued after World War I. For example, during the build-up towards World War II, a group of students at Haverford College in Philadelphia refused to stand because they felt the custom was leading to \"rabid nationalism\". In 1943 in Arizona a federal judge ruled that members of Jehovah's Witnesses cannot be suspended from school for refusing to stand during the national anthem.\n\nIn the 1960s, refusal to stand during the anthem took place for a number of reasons. In the late 1960s, the protest became increasingly common among athletes and at schools, both as a protest of the Vietnam War and as a protest of nationalism. In December 1968, Chris Wood, co-captain of the Adelbert College basketball team was removed from the team for not standing, saying, \"We believe in the fellowship of man. We don't believe in nationalism.\" Five white high school students were suspended in Cumberland, Maryland in February 1970. A federal judge Joseph P. Kinneary ordered reinstatement of a pair of students in Columbus, Ohio, saying that forcing anyone to participate in \"symbolic patriotic ceremonies\" against their will was a violation of the First Amendment to the US Constitution. In November 1970, Kaye Stevens refused to sing the national anthem before a NFL game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City Chiefs, although she had sung the previous week when the Steelers played the New York Jets. She said she was protesting the Steelers planned expenditure of $37 million on the new Three Rivers Stadium when local officials were underfunding treatment for drug users.\n\nFrom 1968 onwards, Jimi Hendrix performed an instrumental version using feedback, distortion and other effects to deconstruct the music with the sonic images of rockets and bombs. Common interpretations link this to a protest against the Vietnam War, opposed to Hendrix own explanation: \"We're all Americans ... it was like 'Go America!'... We play it the way the air is in America today. The air is slightly static, see\".\n\nDonald Sutherland, Gary Goodrow, Peter Boyle, and Jane Fonda developed an anti-war comedy show which featured a skit about people refusing to stand during the anthem which toured about 20 cities in 1971.\n\nAt the same time, Civil Rights became an important cause which led to anthem protests. The 1968 Olympics Black Power salute was a political demonstration conducted by African-American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos during their medal ceremony at the 1968 Summer Olympics in the Olympic Stadium in Mexico City. After having won gold and bronze medals, respectively, in the 200 meter running event, they turned on the podium to face their flags, and to hear the American national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Each athlete raised a black-gloved fist, and kept them raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist Peter Norman all wore human rights badges on their jackets. In his autobiography, \"Silent Gesture\", Smith stated that the gesture was not a \"Black Power\" salute, but a \"human rights salute\". The event is regarded as one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern Olympic Games.\n\nIn 1969, University of Wyoming coach Lloyd Eaton dismissed 14 black football players who requested to wear black armbands to protest the racial slurs they faced during games, particularly against BYU. When the two teams played in 1971, about 50 students at UW refused to stand during the national anthem and wore black armbands during the game. Another place where African Americans refused to stand during the anthem in 1971 was at Northern Illinois University basketball games, which led to widespread criticism.\n\nThe protests became widespread, and in some cases, arrangements were made for the anthem to be played before athletes left the locker room. Lew Alcindor, later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, began to refuse to stand at UCLA basketball games, and in response the anthem was played before the players left the locker room in the UCLA-University of Washington game. The same was done when the five starters of Florida State University's basketball team, all African American, played Tulane University in 1971 in New Orleans.\nDuring the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Vincent Matthews of New York City and Wayne Collett of Santa Monica, California came in first and second in the 400 meter race. The pair refused to stand at attention on the victory stand to boos and whistles from the crowd. The pair were barred from running in the 1,600 meter relay later in the games.\n\nCivil rights based protests continued into the late 1970s, In 1978, a student was barred from receiving his diploma in Dayton, Ohio for refusing to sing.\n\nOn August 24, 1990, Irish pop singer Sinead O'Connor threatened to boycott her scheduled performance that night at the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel Township, New Jersey, if the U.S. national anthem were played. In her own words, she explained,\n\nThe Center gave in to her demands, but not without controversy. Frank Sinatra criticized her the following evening while performing at the same venue, stating that he wished that he could \"kick her in the ass.\" New York state Senator Nicholas Spano urged people to boycott O'Connor's subsequent show in Saratoga, saying \"I'm sure Ms. O'Connor would be the first to complain if someone tried to censor her performance, yet she is trying to censor the national anthem by refusing to perform where it is played.\"\n\nIn 1996, there was protest in the NBA, when Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, guard for the Denver Nuggets, refused to stand during the anthem before games in protest of anti-Islamic rhetoric. He was suspended for his actions and received hostile responses and death threats, but the issue receiving widespread attention. It was noted that at the same time Sam Perkins, who played for the Seattle SuperSonics, is a Jehovah's Witness who refuse to pledge allegiance to any government; he stood apart from his teammates during the national anthem. George Shinn, owner of the Charlotte Hornets, threatened to trade any player who refused to stand. After his suspension, Abdul-Rauf stood, but with his head bowed in silent prayer.\n\nIn 2003, two women's basketball players, Toni Smith of Manhattanville College and Deidra Chatman of the University of Virginia, made headlines for refusing to face the flag during the national anthem. Chatman, a Jehovah's Witness, protested for one game in March 2003 due to her anti-war views in light of the then-current tensions between the U.S. and Iraq. Smith, who had been boycotting the anthem all season long before being finally noticed in February 2003, said that she was also protesting the United States' involvement in Iraq, as well as a growing disparity between the rich and the poor. During one of her team's games on February 23, 2003, a fan named Jerry Kiley, a self-described Vietnam veteran, ran onto the court and confronted her with an American flag, saying, \"She has not earned the right to disrespect the flag.\"\n\nIn 2004, Carlos Delgado of the Toronto Blue Jays Major League Baseball team decided he would no longer stand during the song, \"God Bless America\" out of protest at America's wars in the Middle East.\n\nDuring 2016, several professional athletes protested police brutality during the United States (U.S.) national anthem. The protests began in the National Football League (NFL) after San Francisco 49ers quarterback (QB) Colin Kaepernick sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third preseason game of 2016. Kaepernick also sat during the first two preseason games, but he went unnoticed. The protests have generated mixed reactions and have since spread to other U.S. sports leagues.\n\nStemming from the Kaepernick controversy, before the beginning of the 2016 World Cup of Hockey tournament in Toronto, Canada, Team USA coach John Tortorella told in an interview that if any one of his players were to sit out during the anthem, they would sit on the bench for the entire duration of the game.\n"}
