{"id": "41773358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41773358", "title": "AAA (video game industry)", "text": "AAA (video game industry)\n\nAAA (pronounced \"triple-A\") is an informal classification used for video games produced and distributed by a mid-sized or major publisher, typically having higher development and marketing budgets. \n\nIn the mid 2010s the term AAA+ began to be used to describe AAA type games that generated additional revenue over time in a similar fashion to MMOs by using software as a service (SaaS) methods, such as season passes or expansion packs.\n\nThe term is analogous to the film industry term \"blockbuster\".\n\nThe term \"AAA\" began to be used in the late 1990s, when some development companies started using the expression at gaming conventions in the US.\n\nBy the seventh generation of video game consoles (late 2000s) AAA game development on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 game consoles typically cost in the low tens of millions of dollars ($15 to 20m) for a new game, with some sequels having even higher total budgets - for example \"Halo 3\" is estimated to have had a development cost of $30m, and a marketing budget of $40m. According to a whitepaper published for EA games (Dice Europe) the seventh generation saw a contraction in the number of video game developing houses creating AAA level titles, reducing from an estimated 125 to around 25, but with a roughly corresponding fourfold increase in staffing required for game development.\n\nDuring the seventh generation, AAA (or \"blockbuster\") games had marketing at a similar level to high-profile films, with television, billboard and newspaper advertising; a corresponding increasing reliance of sequels, reboots and similarly franchised IP was also seen, in order to minimize risk. Costs at the end of the generation had risen as high as the hundreds of millions of dollars - the estimated cost of \"Grand Theft Auto V\" was ~$265m. The same conditions also drove the growth of the indie game scene at the other end of the development spectrum, where lower costs enabled innovation and risk taking.\n\nAt around the period of transition from seventh to eighth generation of consoles the cost of AAA development was considered by some to be a threat to the stability of the industry. The failure of a single game to meet production costs could lead to the closure of a studio - Radical Entertainment was closed by parent Activision despite selling an estimated 1 million units on console in a short period after release. Ubisoft game director Alex Hutchinson described the AAA franchise model as potentially harmful, stating he thought it led to either focus group tested products aimed at maximizing profit, and or a push towards ever higher graphics fidelity and impact at a cost of depth or gameplay.\n\nThe eighth generation of video game consoles (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Wii U) saw further increases in costs and staffing - at Ubisoft AAA game development involved 400 to 600 persons for open world games, split across multiple locations and countries.\n\nThe desire for profitability caused publishers to look at alternative revenue models, where players continued to contribute revenue after the initial purchase, either by premium models, DLC, online passes, and other forms of subscription. In the mid 2010s large publishers began a focus on games engineered to have a long tail in terms of revenue from individual consumers, similar to the way MMO games generate income - these included those with expansion or season pass content such as with \"Destiny\", \"Battlefield\", and the \"Call of Duty\" series; and those which generated revenue from selling in-game items, sometimes purely cosmetic, such as \"Overwatch\" or \"League of Legends\". Titles of this type are sometimes referred to as \"AAA+\".\n\nAAA game development has been identified as one environment where crunch time and other working pressures that negatively affect the employees are particularly evident.\n\nThe console videogame industry lacks the equivalent of a B movie, made for TV, or direct-to-video scene. However, games with very low production costs that are not critically well received are sometimes referred to as \"bargain bin\" titles.\n\nThe term \"AAA+\" has been used by independent video game company CD Projekt in an attempt to promote their new content as being of a very high quality, despite being technically an indie game; additionally the term has been used with a different meaning to figuratively describe AAA games with additional methods of revenue generation, generally through purchases in addition to the cost of the base game. In 2016, \"Gameindustry.biz\" described AAA+ games as products that \"combine AAA production values and aesthetics with Software as a Service (SaaS) principles to keep players engaged for months or even years\".\n\nIn general use the term \"AAA+\" may refer to a subset of AAA games that are the highest selling or have the highest production values.\n\nTriple-I (or Triple-i) has been used to refer to independently funded games (see Indie game) that meet an analogous quality level in their field; i.e., Indie games that are relatively high budget, scope, and ambition.\n\n"}

It was released on August 25, 2014 as the second official single from the band's fifth studio album, \"V\" (2014). It was written by Adam Levine, Benny Blanco and Shellback; the latter is also the producer. The official Remix features J. Cole and another remix features Big Boi, both written and produced by Freaky Ta, DCBC, and Aftermath artist Me3mo (Sameem Nadeem).\n\nThe song peaked at number three on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 giving Maroon 5 their tenth top 10 single in the U.S.\n\n\"Animals\" was featured in the promotional advertisement of the 2015 Kia Soul and the television shows \"Elementary\" and \"Dancing with the Stars\". The song was covered by Ice Nine Kills, was included on the compilation album \"Punk Goes Pop Vol. 6\".\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Animals\" at number 32 on its year-end list of the 50 best songs of 2014.\n\nThe music video was released on September 29, 2014 on Vevo. Directed by Samuel Bayer, the video features Adam Levine and his wife, Behati Prinsloo who portrays the woman. The other musicians of Maroon 5 (including their touring member, Sam Farrar, who appeared in a music video of the band for the very first time) also make an appearance - they are seen playing at a nightclub in some scenes of the video.\n\nThe video starts with a woman entering a slaughterhouse, where Levine's character works. After she leaves, an infatuated Levine begins to stalk the woman by following her in the streets and standing outside her apartment in the pouring rain to watch her. He also watches the woman in her sleep and takes numerous photos of Prinsloo which he later trims and places on wires around a dark room. Intercut with this are scenes of a shirtless Levine dripping in fake blood, singing the song inside a meat locker and using animal carcasses for punching bags (referencing to \"Rocky\"). One evening, Levine follows the woman into a nightclub, where he tries to talk to her. Though Prinsloo is amused by Levine and his interest in her, she spends the evening talking to her girlfriends instead. Eventually, Levine is left with no luck, so he goes back to fantasizing about the girl. After an erotic dream, Levine wakes up in a shock and returns to stalking Prinsloo by standing outside her apartment in the rain watching in a dazed state, leading to the similar opening. The final scenes feature Levine and Prinsloo as obsessed lovers kissing—whilst disrobed and covered in fake blood.\n\nThe music video was heavily panned by critics and has been condemned for dehumanizing women and glamorizing violence. Jessica Valenti of \"The Guardian\" criticized the video for attempting to make violence against women seem \"edgy\" stating that \"there is nothing 'alternative' about showing women being stalked, hunted, raped or killed because it’s something that happens every damn day.\" RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) released a statement condemning the video, which wrote that \"No one should ever confuse the criminal act of stalking with romance. The trivialisation of these serious crimes, like stalking, should have no place in the entertainment industry.\" Levine reacted to the controversy in a 2018 interview with \"The Independent\", saying \"That was fucking ridiculous. It was the last video I would have expected to receive any criticism on that front. It was supposed to be creepy! I play the role of the creep, it's literally a character out of a movie. And the song is about animalistic tendencies, I'm talking about eating someone alive. Use your fucking imagination. It's like watching a horror film and notifying the people who made it to tell them you think they're disgusting. People are sometimes too rooted in reality and they can't differentiate. They take everything too personally.\"\n\nIn the United States, the song debuted at number 86 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. On October 18, 2014, the song rose from the number 33 to 8, giving the band their tenth top-ten hit overall and their seventh consecutive Hot 100 top-ten hit since the 2011 chart-topping single \"Moves like Jagger\". The song reached its million sales mark in the US in November 2014. The song peaked at number three on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 issue dating November 22, 2014 and spent fourteen weeks in the top 10.\n\nIn other countries, the song has made the top-ten progress as well, reaching number 2 in Canada. It is also a moderate success in the United Kingdom, where it charted at number 27.\n\nMaroon 5 performed \"Animals\" on \"A Very Grammy Christmas\", \"Saturday Night Live\", \"The Voice\", \"The X Factor\" and Z100's Jingle Ball. The band also performed the song for the \"2015 Victoria's Secret Swim Special\" in Puerto Rico and their worldwide concert tour, the Maroon V Tour (2015–2017).\n\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"V\".\n\n\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Streaming\n"}

The game is praised for smooth integration of action and role-playing elements as well as a wide array of enemies and weapons. It suffers, however, from lacking character development and awkward controls.\n\nWhen the prosperous land of Brightmoon faces a pernicious threat in the form of dragons invading from the neighboring Isle of Kyrk, the warrior prince Asghan begins a perilous journey to counter the attack. The dragons themselves are spurred along by the evil sorcerer Morghan. Asghan embarks on his journey both to avenge his father as well as protect his land.\n\n\"Asghan: The Dragon Slayer\" is characterized largely by Tomb Raider-esque physical puzzles (running, jumping, crawling) as well as typical fantasy elements such as spellcasting and exorcism. Apart from being agile and magically proficient, Asghan is also able to use a wealth of different weapons. He employs these skills in series of dungeons and arenas including but not limited to a ferocious female dragon's dungeon, a green dragon's dungeon, an iceberg, a forest, and a witch's cavern.\n\nLike most modern fantasy franchises, \"Asghan: The Dragon Slayer\" is littered with elements from J.

{"id": "7515305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7515305", "title": "Barbette (performer)", "text": "Barbette (performer)\n\nBarbette (December 19, 1898 – August 5, 1973) was an American female impersonator, high-wire performer, and trapeze artist born in Texas on December 19, 1899. Barbette attained great popularity throughout the United States but his greatest fame came in Europe and especially Paris, in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nBarbette began performing as an aerialist at around the age of 14 as one-half of a circus act called The Alfaretta Sisters. After a few years of circus work, Barbette went solo and adopted his exotic-sounding pseudonym. He performed in full drag, revealing himself as male only at the end of his act.\n\nFollowing a career-ending illness or injury (the sources disagree on the cause), which left him in constant pain, Barbette returned to Texas but continued to work as a consultant for motion pictures as well as training and choreographing aerial acts for a number of circuses. After years of dealing with chronic pain, Barbette committed suicide on August 5, 1973. Both in life and following his death, Barbette served as an inspiration to a number of artists, including Jean Cocteau and Man Ray.\n\nBarbette (birth name cited as Vander Clyde and Vander Clyde Broadway) was born on December 19, 1899, (although it is sometimes cited as 1904) in Texas. Most sources indicate he was born in Round Rock, although Barbette stated that his birthplace was Trickham. His Draft Registration Card, dated 7 September 1918, states that his birthday was 19 December 1898.\n\nSome confusion surrounds the name of Barbette's father. On a 1923 passport application, Barbette lists his father's name as \"Henry Broadway\" and notes him as deceased. However, Barbette's death certificate gives his father's first name as \"Jeff.\" The death certificate lists his mother's name as \"Hattie Wilson;\" Barbette listed her name as \"Mrs. E. S. Loving\" on his passport application, as well as his 1918 Draft Registration form.\n\nIn the United States Census of 1900, Barbette and his mother, Hattie Broadway (née Martin, 1879-1949), were living in Llano, Texas, in the household of his maternal great-grandparents, Florence E. and William Paschall, a farmer. Hattie, then aged 21, was listed as a widow on the census, while her son's birthdate is given as December 1897. Also living in the household was Hattie Broadway's younger brother, Malcolm Wilson.\n\nHattie Broadway married, as her second husband, in 1906, Samuel E. Loving (1868-1953), who worked in a broom factory, and had five more children, sons Eugene Loving (1908-1971) and Sam Paschall Loving (1917-1996), and daughters Hugo Loving (1910-1912), Bonsilene Loving (born 1914), and Mary Martin Loving (1915-1997); after his mother's second marriage, Barbette was known as \"Vander Loving\".\n\nBarbette's mother took him to the circus at an early age in Austin and he was fascinated by the wire act. \"The first time she took me to the circus in Austin, I knew I would be a performer, and from then on I'd work in the fields during the cotton-picking season to earn money in order to go to the circus as often as possible.\" Barbette practiced for hours by walking along his mother's steel clothes line. He graduated from high school at the age of 14.\n\nAfter high school, Barbette began his circus career as one-half of the aerialist team The Alfaretta Sisters. One of the sisters had died unexpectedly and Barbette answered the surviving sister's ad for a replacement, auditioning in San Antonio. Together the pair decided that it was more dramatic for a woman to perform the acrobatic stunts. \"She told me that women's clothes always make a wire act more impressive...and she asked me if I'd mind dressing as a girl. I didn't; and that's how it began.\" Following his time as an Alfaretta, Barbette next joined an act called Erford's Whirling Sensation. This act included three people who hung from a spinning apparatus by their teeth.\n\nHe then developed a solo act and moved to the vaudeville stage. He took on the name \"Barbette\", believing that it had an exotic French sound and because it could conceivably be either a first or a last name. His solo debut was at the Harlem Opera House in 1919. Barbette performed trapeze and wire stunts in full drag, maintaining the illusion of femininity until the end of his act, when he would pull off his wig and strike exaggerated masculine poses. For the next several years he toured the Keith Vaudeville Circuit, advertised as a \"versatile specialty.\"\n\nBarbette made his European debut in 1923, having been sent by the William Morris Agency first to England and then to Paris. He appeared in such venues as the Casino de Paris, the Moulin Rouge, the Empire, the Médrano Circus, the Alhambra Theater and the Folies Bergère.\n\nHe returned to America in 1924 to appear in \"The Passing Show of 1924\" which ran for four months beginning in September. Also in this timeframe he became a featured attraction with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus and toured London, Brussels and Berlin. It was during an engagement at the London Palladium that Barbette was found engaged in sexual activity with another man. His contract was cancelled and he was never able to obtain a work permit for England again.\n\nBarbette was championed by avant garde artist Jean Cocteau. Cocteau wrote in 1923 to Belgian friend and critic Paul Collaer: \nNext week in Brussels, you'll see a music-hall act called 'Barbette' that has been keeping me enthralled for a fortnight. The young American who does this wire and trapeze act is a great actor, an angel, and he has become the friend to all of us. Go and see him ... and tell everybody that he is no mere acrobat in women's clothes, nor just a graceful daredevil, but one of the most beautiful things in the theatre. Stravinsky, Auric, poets, painters, and I myself have seen no comparable display of artistry on the stage since Nijinsky. \nTo other friends he wrote \"Your great loss for 1923 was Barbette – a terrific act at the Casino de Paris...Ten unforgettable minutes. A \"theatrical\" masterpiece. An angel, a flower, a bird.\"\n\nIn 1926 Cocteau wrote an influential essay on the nature and artifice of the theatre called \"Le Numéro Barbette\" that was published in \"Nouvelle Revue Française\". In this essay, Cocteau celebrates Barbette as an exemplar of theatrical artifice.\n\n\"Barbette,\" writes Cocteau, \ntransforms effortlessly back and forth between man and woman. His female glamour and elegance Cocteau likens to a cloud of dust thrown into the eyes of the audience, blinding it to the masculinity of the movements he needs to perform his acrobatics. That blindness is so complete that at the end of his act, Barbette does not simply remove his wig but instead \"plays the part of a man\". He rolls his shoulders, stretches his hands, swells his muscles...And after the fifteenth or so curtain call, he gives a mischievous wink, shifts from foot to foot, mimes a bit of an apology, and does a shuffling little street urchin dance – all of it to erase the fabulous, dying-swan impression left by the act. \nCocteau calls upon his fellow artists to incorporate deliberately this effect that he believes for Barbette is instinctive.\nCocteau commissioned a series of photographs of Barbette by the Surrealist artist Man Ray, which captured not only aspects of Barbette's performance but also his process of transformation into his female persona. He also cast Barbette in his experimental first film \"Le Sang d'un Poete\" (\"The Blood of a Poet\") (1930). Barbette appears in a scene in a theatre box with several extras, dressed in Chanel gowns, who burst into applause at the sight of a card game that ends in suicide. He replaced the Vicomtesse de Noailles, who along with her husband had originally shot the scene but were appalled upon seeing the finished film, as the card game/suicide had been shot separately.\n\nSpeaking of his preparation for the scene, Barbette, who knew he was replacing the Vicomtesse, said, \nI tried to imagine myself a descendant of the Marquis de Sade, of the Comtesse de Chevigné...and a long line of rich bankers – all of which the Vicomtesse was. For a boy from Round Rock, Texas, that demanded a lot of concentration – at least as much as working on the wire.\n\nCocteau fell in love with the Barbette persona but their affair was short-lived. Others in Barbette's European circle included Josephine Baker, Anton Dolin, Mistinguett and Sergei Diaghilev.\n\nBarbette is credited with having returned to the United States in 1935 to star on Broadway in the Billy Rose circus musical \"Jumbo\". However, some sources suggest that this may have been a Barbette impersonator.\n\nBarbette continued to perform until the mid-to-late 1930s. Most sources report the year as 1938, while others as early as 1936 and as late as 1942. The end of Barbette's performing career is attributed to a number of causes including a fall, pneumonia, polio, or some combination of the three. All generally agree that whatever the cause, Barbette was left in extreme pain and in need of surgery and extensive rehabilitation to allow him to walk again.\n\nHe became the artistic director and aerialist trainer for a number of circuses, including Ringling Bros. and the Shrine Circus. His work with Ringling Bros. has been described as \"reinvent[ing] the aerial ballet\". The Bird Cage Girls, The Swing High Girls, The Whirl Girls and the Cloud Swing Girls were among the female aerialist troupes whose routines were Barbette's specialty. He created the circus sequences for the Orson Welles-produced Broadway musical \"Around the World\".\n\nBarbette served as a consultant on a number of films, including the circus sequences for \"Till the Clouds Roll By\" (1946) and \"The Big Circus\" (1959), and was hired to coach Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis on gender illusion for the film \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959). Cocteau biographer Francis Steegmuller wrote a profile of Barbette for \"The New Yorker\" in 1969 entitled \"An Angel, A Flower, A Bird\". Barbette created the aerial ballet for \"Disney on Parade\" and toured with it in Australia from 1969 through 1972.\n\nBarbette spent his last months in Texas, living in Round Rock and Austin with his sister, Mary Cahill, often in severe pain. He committed suicide by overdose on August 5, 1973. He was survived by his sister Mary and a half-brother, Sam Loving. Barbette was cremated and his ashes were buried in Round Rock Cemetery.\n\nIn addition to Cocteau's essay \"Le Numéro Barbette\" and his appearance in \"Le Sang d'un Poete\", Barbette also inspired the characterization of \"Death\" in Cocteau's play \"Orphée\". The book \"Barbette\", collecting Cocteau's essay, the \"New Yorker\" profile by Steegmuller, Man Ray's photographs and other material, was published in 1989.\n\nBarbette may have been the inspiration for the 1933 German film, \"Viktor und Viktoria\", which features a plot about a woman pretending to be a female impersonator, whose gimmick of removing her wig at the end of her act is \"inspired by [Barbette's] signature gesture.\" \"Viktor und Viktoria\" was remade in 1935 (\"First a Girl\"), 1957 (\"Viktor und Viktoria\") and 1982 (\"Victor Victoria\", which inspired a 1992 Broadway musical of the same name).\n\nAlfred Hitchcock based a character in the 1930 film \"Murder!\" on Barbette. \"Different Fleshes\" is a book-length poem about Barbette written by Albert Goldbarth. It won the Voertman Poetry Award from the Texas Institute of Letters. In 1993, performance artist John Kelly, under commission from the Brooklyn Academy of Music, based his piece \"Light Shall Lift Them\" on him. Barbette's story is also told in the play, \"Barbette\", written by Bill Lengfelder and David Goodwin and first presented in Dallas, Texas, in 2003. A French restaurant in Minneapolis is named Barbette after the aerialist.\n\n\n"}

After this set-up, exposition is minimal and the narrative must largely be inferred with environmental clues, as the NPCs speak in musical notes, which can eventually be translated by finding musical runes.\n\n\"Chronicles of Teddy\" is a side-scrolling action-adventure game in which the player controls a girl who is initially equipped with a weak sword. Although she can initially do little but run and jump, she will eventually be able to purchase various equipment and items that will upgrade her abilities. Many of these items can be bought in shops by spending marbles, which are the in-universe currency. As NPC dialogue is largely indecipherable until later in the game, the player must discover many aspects of the world, including game mechanics, menus, etc., through experimentation.\n\n\"Chronicles of Teddy\" received positive reviews, currently sitting at 79/100 on Metacritic. \"PlayStation LifeStyle\" gave the game 8.5/10, calling it a \"huge, gorgeous adventure by any reasonable standards, and while retro gamers will probably get a kick out of it more than anyone, it's not content to rest on its laurels and exploit nostalgia.\" It particularly praised the game's art, writing that, \"This is a truly beautiful game, one in which every screen — from the smallest dungeon room to the largest overworld area — has its own identity forged from the intricate details around it.\" However, it criticized the game's \"'learn by playing' approach\", which it said \"backfire[s] when it comes to some of the game's less-intuitive puzzles\". \"Nintendo Life\" awarded it 6/10 and concluded it was a \"somewhat satisfying puzzle platforming adventure game\", praising the \"gorgeous retro-inspired pixel art\" but denouncing the \"combat system that interrupts the flow of gameplay, and lots of backtracking from dungeon to dungeon can make the game feel slow and tedious in spots.\" \"Hardcore Gamer\" scored it 3/5, saying that a \"lack of any direction permeates the title\", nevertheless, it added that \"the game can still be fun. Just like a good exploratory action/adventure game, the feeling of revisiting old areas with new powers to get at previously unobtainable treasures is exciting.\"\n\n"}

Although not always considered coin magic, the tricks are sometimes used in magic shows. The difficulty of the trick ranges greatly, from some that take a few minutes to accomplish, to much more complex ones that can take months, even years, to master. One of the best-known tricks is the relatively advanced coin walk.\n\nThe coin walk is a type of coin trick in which a coin is flipped over the fingers to create the illusion of a coin walking across the back of the hand. It is one of the most famous coin manipulation tricks. It is also known as the coin roll, knuckle roll, and the steeplechase flourish, and can also be performed with poker chips, slugs, or other similar implements.\n\nThe trick is generally performed on the first phalanx bone of each finger of one hand. After the coin has been flipped over by each phalanx, not including the smallest finger, the thumb brings the coin back under the hand and back to the index finger to repeat the trick as many times as desired.\n\nVan Heflin's character Sam performs this manipulation throughout the 1946 film \"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers.\"\nThe characters Peter, Walter and Elizabeth Bishop perform this trick in the TV show \"Fringe.\"\nSteve Carell and Alan Arkin also perform the trick in tandem (almost a \"dueling knuckle walk\") in the movie \"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone\".

As opposed to the \"danse noble\" or \"noble dance\" performed in royal courts which emphasized beauty of movement and noble themes, grotesque dances were comic or lighthearted and created for buffoons and \"commedia dell'arte\" characters to amuse and entertain spectators or patrons. In 16th and 17th centuries grotesque dances were often presented as an anti-masque, performed between the acts of more serious courtly entertainments. Likewise, the 17th century \"ballet a entrées\" (a series of loosely connected tableaux rather than a continuous dramatic narrative) sometimes contained grotesque sequences, most notably those devised by the Duke of Nemours for the court of Louis XIII. \n\nSome of the grotesque performers were physically deformed, but the Italian tradition of \"ballo grottesco\", typified by the dancer and choreographer, Gennaro Magri whose career was at its apex in the 1760s, involved a high degree of virtuosity and athleticism. Ballets which contain grotesque dances or consist solely of grotesque dance include Campra's \"Le jaloux trompé\" and Ravel's \"Daphnis et Chloé\" (Dorcon's dance in Part 1). Dancers who excelled in the grotesque genre besides Magri included Margrethe Schall and John D'Auban.\n\nGennaro Magri's 1779 treatise, \"Trattato teorico-prattico di ballo\", one of the leading publications about dance technique from the 18th century, offers a rare view of the grotesque style of theatrical dance. One of the achievements of Magri's treatise is that is makes the argument for placing the \"ballerini grotteschi\" on the same level of appreciation as \"ballerini seri\". According to Magri, false positions (inwardly turned) or Spanish positions (neutral in turnout) were more often used by \"ballerini grotteschi,\" as opposed to the normative French turned out positions. Magri asserts pirouettes on one foot, revolving for as many turns as possible, as part of the repertory of the \"grotteschi,\" whereas pirouettes on two feet were for amateurs. He also links the \"grotteschi\"'s dance vocabulary with the cabrioles. One interesting such airborne step, \"salto dell'impiccato\" (translated as: hangman's jump) requires great elevation in order to create contrast between the trunk and the falling arms, and then a one-foot landing with the second leg detached into the air as much as possible. Magri assigns wrapping steps, sprung steps, steps of multiple turns, and airborne steps interweaving and beating the legs into the \"grotteschi\"'s repertory of movements. However, he makes the distinction that it is not these steps that make the \"ballerini grotteschi\", but rather the body as a \"vortex of force\" that articulates kinetic principles to get energy out into physical movement in a controlled and concentrated manner. The grotesque bodies are bodies that constantly concentrate and release energy as a characteristic part of their activity.\n\n"}

This situation was created by the Great Depression, which had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers asking for more money, and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices; this ensured that there was a very low profit margin for local films. During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed Hollywood productions.\n\nJava Pacific Film was founded in 1934 in Bandoeng, in what was then the Dutch East Indies, by Dutch-Indonesian journalist Albert Balink working with the Wong brothers.

The name then came to apply to the successful line of robots manufactured by the company. The initial Omnibot was announced with expectations of restoring popular interest in robots, at a time when it was becoming obvious that robots with advanced AI such as R2-D2 were still a long way away. A more advanced version of the Omnibot was called the Omnibot 2000 and did not have a plastic bubble over its head. With the success of the Omnibots, the Omnibot range quickly expanded. After the North American video game crash of 1983 and its debilitating effect on the entire nascent home electronics industry, the Omnibot faded away but it was revived in the early 2000s. The latest version of the Omnibot is the i-SOBOT.\nBoth the Omnibot and the more advanced Omnibot 2000 had a cassette tape player built into the chest area of the robot, which slid out like a drawer to reveal the cassette and could record and play back sequences of commands, as well as regular audio recordings. The built in digital clock with timers and alarms allowed the playback of movement recordings at specified times, such as moving into the bedroom in the morning. Both robots were able to broadcast speech from the remote control handset through a speaker on the robot, and both were shipped with a cardboard \"home\" base which was suggested to be taped to the floor and used as a reference point for programming.\nBoth Omnibot and the Omnibot 2000 could carry light objects. The Omnibot carried a specially made tray which slotted into its claws, and the Omnibot 2000 had a tray which slotted into its motorised \"accessory panel\", allowing the tray to revolve cups and glasses into the reach of the arm.\n\nThe Omnibot 2000 was 25 inches tall, powered by a 6-volt lead–acid battery and two AA batteries. Its right arm was controllable. The user could control its shoulder, elbow, wrist and fingers, the left arm being a poseable \"dummy\".\n\nUnfortunately, losing the remote control unit for an Omnibot meant that the robot was virtually useless outside of the clock and cassette deck based functions.\n\nTwo lesser known robots in the Omnibot range were the Omnibot OOM and the Omniwagon. The Omnibot OOM was shaped like a standard Omnibot except with the addition of a spherical head, its remote controller including a basic form of voice-control. The Omniwagon was merely a remote controlled drive unit and wheels from an omnibot with a flat surface on top to carry objects.\n\nThe Omnibot OOM (later released in North America as the \"Hearoid\") was closely based on the standard Omnibot. Changes included a more anthropomorphic head design, remotely controlled light-up eyes that acted rather like headlights, and a more sophisticated remote controller that included primitive voice control.\n\nRadio Shack retailed a version of the Omnibot named the Robie Sr.. Made by Tomy in Japan, these were essentially a standard Omnibot, but with the dome-shaped head replaced by the more anthropomorphic head of the Omnibot OOM / Hearoid, and the sound is different compared to the original Omnibot.\n\nThe Omnibot Jr., also known as the \"Charmmy\", was a 10.5 inches tall remote controlled robot with an attachable tray, featuring styling reminiscent of the original Omnibot. Simultaneously released by Radio Shack as the Robie Jr., Omnibot Jr. included a microphone on either side of the robot's head that allowed it to hear an ultrasonic sound emitted by the remote controller. The dual microphones allowed Charmmy to determine the rough direction of the controller, and navigate to its location - sometimes even around corners. The Omnibot Jr. was also equipped with a bump sensor that allowed it to navigate around objects, and this sensor was also used along with sensors in the arms to trigger several recorded announcements should the robot bump into an object or an item be placed on the tray.\n\nThe classic Omnibot had a cheaper, smaller cousin known as the Verbot, known in its native Japan as the KI*KU*ZO. At nine inches tall, the Verbot was the mid-sized option compared to the smaller Dingbot and the larger Omnibot. It was somewhat similar to the Omnibot in appearance but was much more limited in features. The Verbot also came with a wireless remote control that could operate the robot through voice commands. Up to eight commands could be programmed. The Verbot could move forward and backward, left and right, on command. The Verbot was also able to pick up small objects, a feature many toy robots of the era lacked. The robot expressed some personality by blinking and smiling. Disadvantages common to the Verbot were that it was quite noisy, reprogramming was necessary every time the robot was powered up again, and as with all of the Omnibot series its white plastic body would turn yellow if left in the sun. The Verbot was actually quite complex, utilizing a single motor for all its movements and an intricate set of gears for picking up objects. Programming Verbot was accomplished by pushing one of the buttons on its front panel and holding it down while the corresponding action was spoken into the remote control's microphone and then releasing the button. As with most Omnibots, losing the remote meant the robot could not be used to full capacity, but some hobbyists have modified cheap 1980s walkie-talkies for inputting voice commands.\n\nIn recent times, many hobbyists have turned to hacking, tweaking and improving their Omnibots. Commonly added features are IR Sensors, video cameras, speech recognition chips, stronger motors, microcontrollers, sonars and other advanced enhancements that would not have been possible in the 80s.\n\nIn the early 2000s, a gutted Omnibot was used as part of a contestant on the US television show Battlebots. The robot, named Dr. Inferno Jr. (an updated version of another combat robot that used a gutted Omnibot) won several awards in the competition's \"Lightweight Division\". The Omnibot on top of the drivetrain had no dome on top, and its arms were replaced with twin saws.\n\nIn 2006, shortly after the merger of Tomy and Takara, the company first unveiled a prototype for a new Omnibot, initially called \"Omnibot 2007: i-SOBOT\" but which has since been officially named, \"Omnibot 17μ: i-SOBOT.\" (\"μ\" is the Greek letter \"mu\" symbolizing micron, referring to the specs of the servo motors) in Japan and simply \"i-SOBOT\" in the U.S. market. i-SOBOT was scheduled to go on sale in Japan in October 2007 (Japanese language with blue and white color), but an English language, black and grey version went on sale first in the U.S., in September, 2007. Reportedly, a European version will go on the market in 2008.\n\ni-SOBOT, which has been certified by Guinness World Records as \"the world's smallest humanoid robot in production\" is equipped with 17 proprietary servo-motors and can be controlled by an IR remote controller and also via voice commands. It is capable of speaking hundreds of words and phrases and has nearly 200 pre-programmed actions, plus allows additional programming by the user via the remote control. The retail price is approximately ¥30,000 in Japan and $350 in the U.S. i-SOBOT is fully bi-pedal. In 2013 the new robot i-SODOG will come out from Tomy.\n\n\n"}

It is set in the Eastern Front of World War II and covers the 8th Guards Rifle Division operations during the 1941 Battle of Moscow. On DVD, it is also known as Battle for Moscow.\n\nThe film is directed by Kim Druzhinin and Andrey Shalopa, produced by Panfilov's Twenty Eight and Gaijin Entertainment. Initially the film used crowdfunding, later it has been financially supported by Russian and Kazakhstan governments and Gaijin Entertainment game development company. The premiere took place in Volokolamsk in 16 November 2016 and in Russia in 24 November 2016.\n\nThe plot was written by Andrey Shalopa in 2009, and the production team took their teaser trailer of the film to Boomstarter crowdfunding platform, seeking co-financiers. \"It will be a film about Soviet heroes. We will describe the battle near Dubosekovo, which went down in history as the deed of Panfilov's 28 men\". The crowdfunding campaign was successful, and the film raised 3 million rubles out of planned 300 thousands. By the time of the premiere the film raised 34,746 million rubles.\n\nIn May 2014 Gaijin Entertainment, Russian game development company known for its game War Thunder joined the funding.\n\nIn December 2014 the film won a grant of 30 million rubles from Russian Ministry of Culture, and later the Ministry of Culture and Sport of Kazakhstan added another $287 thousand. \n\nCollecting money, producing and renting the film accompanied a vigorous discussion of its historical authenticity in the blogosphere and the media. The picture was positively received by the spectators, having collected in the CIS 384 million rubles and becoming the best film of the year according to the results of the VTsIOM poll.\n\nUSSR, late November 1941. Based on the account by reporter Vasiliy Koroteev that appeared in the Red Army's newspaper, \"Krasnaya Zvezda\", shortly after the Battle of Moscow, this is the story of Panifilov's Twenty-Eight, a group of twenty-eight soldiers of the Red Army's 316th Rifle Division, under the command of General Ivan Panfilov, that stopped the advance on Moscow of a column of fifty-four German tanks of the 11th Panzer Division for several days. Though armed only with standard issue Mosin-Nagant infantry rifles and DP and PM-M1910 machine guns, all useless against tanks, and with wholly inadequate RPG-40 anti-tank grenades and PTRD-41 anti-tank rifles, they fight tirelessly and defiantly, with uncommon bravery and unwavering dedication, to protect Moscow and their Motherland.\n\nDue to the peculiarities of the crowd-budgeting budget, the casting took a long time. The first confirmed actor was Yakov Kucherevskiy, who played Sergeant Dobrobabin - he agreed to withdraw two years before filming. The most recent confirmed Aleksey Morozov for the role of political instructor Klochkov - one day before the start of the shooting period. Panfilov's division was formed in the Kazakh SSR, the company included many Kazakhs, so many actors of Oriental appearance were required in the crowd - Shalope's team turned to the national diasporas of Moscow, St. Petersburg and Ivanovo. In general, the team consisted of 360 participants, and in total the project involved up to 700 people.\n\nIn the process of filming, the picture operators used the following documents: storyboard, director's script, operator's table and tank battle scheme. The battle scheme contained the exact location of the tanks and the camera at different times, and the operator's table described what technique to use in what scenes. Such careful preparation allowed the team to work in winter conditions and with a short daylight.\n\nThe directors wanted to use a minimum of 3D animation and take as many effects as possible on the camera. The first experiments they conducted, moving primitive toy tanks the size of a matchbox on the sheets with the help of ropes. These experiments have shown that using reduced models of tanks will create the right level of realism.\n\nAs a contractor for the creation of special effects, Scandinava studio, previously specializing in commercials and having no experience with large films, was chosen. Specialists from Scandinava performed experiments on high-speed shooting and interested Druzhinin and Shalopu with his clip \"Oil\", in which a column of combustible liquid was rotating and ignited without the use of 3D animation. To work on the film, the studio expanded the staff from six to 28 people.\n\nTo create personnel with tanks, studio specialists used the old technology of combined shooting-special effect. On the field, full-size wooden models of tanks, covered with green cloth, were used in the field, which the workers moved around the field on a sleigh. Then the surveyors made measurements of the landscape, and Scandinava recreated the battlefield at a scale of 1:16 in the studio and photographed all the scenes with detailed models of tanks, reduced by 16 times. To create a winter atmosphere in the film (snow, blizzard, the sky changing in the film's drama), the consequences of the attacks (smoke, ash), and to amplify gun shots and some explosions, Scandinava decided not to use the traditional approach using CGI (Computer-generated imagery, The letters \"computer-generated images\"), instead taking real natural effects on the camera. Shooting on the nature, tanks and natural effects were collected by layers on the computer in one single image.\n\nThis approach required a certain technique of filming. In order to move the toy tank were like moving the present, it was necessary to shoot it four times faster, and then slow down the received frames. The camera, accordingly, had to be moved four times faster than on the field, which can not be done with hands. Therefore, in the pavilion shootings for camera control, the operators used the robotic arm KUKA Agilus, provided and programmed with the help of specialists from the Research Research Institute of Robotics. For close-up shots, a full-size mock-up of the PzKpfw IV tank was built, the cabin of which was recreated on Lenfilm as a separate capsule on the springs, which made it possible to achieve realistic pitching during shooting. Currently, the layout is kept in the Museum of the Karelian isthmus in the Vyborg.\n\nThe whole film was shot on the camera Arri Alexa (English) Russian, except for tanks, where because of the size required the apparatus of the company Red. Optometry used a spherical lens Illumina of the St. Petersburg plant \"LOMO\" - according to the operator, this solution allowed to smooth out the effect of the \"excessively high-quality\" image, which is inherent in all modern cameras.\n\nSound for the film was recorded and reduced to the technical base of the studio \"Nevafilm\". Mikhail Kostylev, famous for his soundtracks for computer games, took up writing music for the film. According to the composer, he sought to convey a sense of pride in the Victory and the feat, creating an epic musical background in which the drama would remain. The leitmotif of most compositions is the theme \"Eternal Flame\", which Kostylev wrote at an early stage of the production of the film. The soundtrack was recorded after the presentation of the video, with the first score for all instruments was recorded using a MIDI editor. This allowed the director to immediately appreciate the approximate sound of the music, its mood and tempo. Then, using a metronome, individual instrument parts, vocals, chorus and parts were recorded, in which a whole orchestra was involved.\n\nChoral parts are performed by vocalists of the Moscow Synodal Choir under the direction of the Honored Artist of Russia Aleksei Puzankov, instrumental musicians of the ensemble of soloists of the Academic Symphony Orchestra of the Philharmonic.\n\nApart from its crowdfunding budget, Panfilov’s 28 Men was produced with backing from the culture ministries of Russia and Kazakhstan. Russian culture minister Vladimir Medinsky praised the planned release of the film, telling the upper chamber of Russia's parliament that the production reflected the country's interest in patriotic films. Referencing criticism over the historical accuracy of the Soviet legend that formed the basis of the movie, he stated that the story is \"a sacred legend that shouldn't be interfered with. People that do that are filthy scum.\"\n\nRent a film in Russia was held from November 24 to December 26, 2016. The volume of the total ticket office for the first weekend was 180,559,249 rubles. In Russia and Belarus at the beginning of the film the film yielded only to the film \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\".\n\nAccording to the report of the Cinema Foundation, at the 48th week (from 24 to 30 November), Russian cinemas were visited by 3.4 million spectators, of which every fourth spectator chose \"28 panfilovtsev\", and the fees amounted to 209.8 million rubles. The fund reports that the percentage of morning and afternoon shows was at evening level. That is, the film attracted a wide audience - and the adult viewer, and schoolchildren with students. In total, up to November 30, 36,616 sessions were held in Russia, which were attended by 878,944 spectators. The fees in Kazakhstan amounted to 61.3 million tenge.\n\nOn December 26, the film became available for purchase in online stores, and on January 27, 2017, it was released on DVD and Blu-ray. By mid-January, box office fees amounted to about 366.6 million rubles in Russia, and all in the CIS countries the film collected 385 million rubles.\n\n\"Panfilov's 28 Men\" holds an aggregate score of 7.1/10 in user reviews on IMDB.\n\n"}

Whilst serving in the Union Army during the Civil War, Gilmore wrote the lyrics to the song \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home.\" This was published under the pseudonym Louis Lambert in September 1863.\n\nGilmore was born in Ballygar, County Galway. He started his music career at age fifteen, and spent time in Canada with an English band. He settled in Boston, Massachusetts in 1848, becoming leader of the Suffolk, Boston Brigade, and Salem bands in swift succession. He also worked in the Boston music store of John P. Ordway and founded Ordway's Aeolians, a group of blackface minstrels. With the Salem Band, Gilmore performed at the 1857 inauguration of President James Buchanan.\n\nIn 1858 he founded \"Gilmore's Band,\" and at the outset of war the band enlisted with the 24th Massachusetts Volunteers, accompanying General Burnside to North Carolina. After the temporary discharge of bands from the field, Governor Andrew of Massachusetts entrusted Gilmore with the task of re-organizing military music-making, and General Nathaniel P. Banks created him Bandmaster-general.\n\nWhen peace resumed, Gilmore was asked to organize a celebration, which took place at New Orleans. That success emboldened him to undertake two major music festivals at Boston, the National Peace Jubilee in 1869 and the World's Peace Jubilee and International Musical Festival in 1872. These featured monster orchestras of massed bands with the finest singers and instrumentalists (including the only American appearance by \"waltz king\" Johann Strauss II) and cemented Gilmore's reputation as the leading musical figure of the age. Coliseums were erected for the occasions, holding 60- and 120,000 persons. Grateful Bostonians presented Gilmore with medals and cash, but in 1873 he moved to New York City, as bandmaster of the 22nd Regiment. Gilmore took this band on acclaimed tours of Europe.\n\nIt was back on home soil, preparing an 1892 musical celebration of the quadricentennial anniversary of Christopher Columbus' voyage of discovery, that Gilmore collapsed and died in St. Louis. Patrick S. Gilmore was buried in Calvary Cemetery (Queens, New York).\n\nIn many ways Gilmore can be seen as the principal figure in 19th-century American music. He was a composer, the \"Famous 22nd Regiment March\" from 1874 is just one example. He held the first \"Promenade Concert in America\" in 1855, the forerunner to today's Boston Pops. He set up \"Gilmore's Concert Garden\", which became Madison Square Garden. He was the Musical Director of the Nation in effect, leading the festivities for the 1876 Centennial celebrations in Philadelphia and the dedication of the Statue of Liberty in 1886. In 1888 he started the tradition of seeing in the New Year in Times Square. \n\nIn 1891, he played for some of Thomas Edison's first commercial recordings. Musically, he was the first arranger to set brass instruments against the reeds, which remains the basis for big band orchestration. His arrangements of contemporary classics did a great deal to familiarize the American people with the work of the great European musical masters. \n\nPatrick Sarsfield Gilmore was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36862048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36862048", "title": "Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy", "text": "Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy\n\nProfessor Layton and the Azran Legacy is a puzzle game developed by Level-5 for the Nintendo 3DS. It is the sixth entry in the \"Professor Layton\" series, making up the third and final part of the prequel trilogy of games and according to Level 5 CEO Akihiro Hino, it will be the last Layton title to star Layton himself as the protagonist. The game saw a release in early to late 2013 in all territories except North America, where it was released on February 28 of the following year.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of \"Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask\", the Azran Legacies, the relics of an ancient civilization, are now possessed by a mysterious organization called Targent, which wishes to use the Azran's untold power for itself. In addition, Jean Descole, Targent's rival, also wishes to harness the power of the Azran Legacies, thus setting the stage as the conflict for the Legacies unfolds. The story begins with Layton, Luke, and Emmy boarding the airship Bostonius. They discuss the letter they received from Professor Desmond Sycamore, an eminent archaeologist, who tells the professor that he had found a so-called living \"mummy\". They travel to Froenborg, where they meet Sycamore and Aurora, a girl frozen in ice. After solving a puzzle that frees her from the ice, she is captured by Targent, which is led by a man named Leon Bronev. Targent's agents then escape with Aurora onboard their zeppelin, and Layton, Luke, Emmy, Sycamore, and Raymond, Sycamore's butler, give chase in the Bostonius. Layton and Luke rescue her and find she has lost her memory before Layton accidentally drops her as they are flying over forest woodland.\n\nThe allies realize they are in the town of Kodh, and the next chapter follows their escapade through the town to find Aurora. When they first see Aurora, she appears to be walking on water, but Layton figures that there is ice underneath the ocean which can be used as stepping stones. They eventually make their way across the lake to Aurora and find her speaking mysterious word in an unknown language. Her words open an Azran chamber located under the huge lake surrounding Kodh. There, they find that they must recover the five Azran eggs, scattered around the world by an ancient Azran leader, to unlock the Azran Legacy.\n\nTo prepare for their global expedition, Layton, Luke, Emmy, Aurora, and Sycamore depart for London. The intention is to stock up on necessary supplies, but they meet Inspector Grosky, who is also investigating Targent. They then investigate a case where the local museum had been robbed of several archaeological artifacts, and they uncover Targent's involvement as well as that someone in the London police force was involved in the crime. Layton then identifies the perpetrator as Detective Inspector Leonard Bloom and, having recently become aware of Targent, is able to expose him as an agent of Targent. As a result, Bloom is arrested, and the allies are free to embark upon their expedition. However, Targent continues to pursue them.\n\nLayton's group travels to five different locations to acquire the eggs, each town requiring their aid. In the jungle village of Phong Gi, the chief of the tribe is only willing to give his egg to them if they can make him laugh. Layton eventually realizes he is blind and handcrafts some glasses for him; in return, he is given the egg. In the tropical town of San Grio, the party learns that the egg (nicknamed the \"Popoño\") is passed around the townsfolk as part of a tradition. In the desert ghost town of Torrido, an old wolf who has the egg keeps attacking, but in reality, the wolf is merely trying to visit an old friend from many years ago. In the windy village of Hoogland, the group learns of a tradition where a young woman is seemingly sacrificed in order to appease a wind god but discover there is an Azran machine, currently broken, that is creating the stormy winds. After fixing the machine, the townsfolk give them the egg. Finally, in the walled-off city of Mossinia, Layton and company find themselves in a mystery after learning all of the adults are comatose. After successfully filling the waterways in the town, the adults are revived, and the party receives the final egg.\n\nAfter retrieving the five eggs, Aurora attempts to unlock her true power and regain all of her memories, but soon finds out one of the eggs is a fake. They head back to the Azran dome in Kodh and find out the last egg was there previously, but it was taken by Targent, and a fake one was put in its place. Layton, Luke, Emmy, Aurora, and Sycamore fly to Targent's base of operations called the Nest to retrieve the final egg. On the way, they meet up with an archaeologist from Kodh who attempts to hijack Targent's airship, but he ultimately succumbs to his injuries sustained by Targent. He is taken away from the Nest to be hospitalized by two former Targent agents, and the group makes it to the Obsidian Tower located at the heart of the Nest. They scale the tower and make it to the top, reaching Bronev's office. There, Bronev offers Layton a spot on Targent, which Layton declines. The two then proceed to play a game for the last egg, with Layton coming out as the victor. Before he hands the egg though, Bronev shows Layton video footage of his parents, Lucille and Roland. He then proceeds to threaten their lives if Layton does not join Targent. Prompts by Sycamore allow Layton to decline the offer once again, and Bronev leaves the Nest while the group takes the final egg.\n\nUltimately, the five keys join together to form a master key. Sycamore suddenly betrays the professor, revealing himself to have been Descole the entire time. After a fight between Layton and Descole, Descole steals the key and flees to Froenborg. The group goes on without him back to Froenborg's cave where they first found Aurora. There, Layton, Luke, and Emmy attempt to stop Bronev, but Emmy follows suit in betraying the professor, revealing that she had been working for her \"uncle\" Leon Bronev all along as she seizes Luke and threatens to kill him with an icicle. After they steal the key to the Azran sanctuary from Descole, Emmy and Bronev take Aurora into the bowels of the sanctuary, intending to use her power to unlock what they perceive to be the \"Azran legacy\". With these revelations, Descole forms an alliance with Layton to fight the common enemy. It is further revealed that, although Emmy was raised by Bronev, she is not truly evil, nor is Bronev the man she remembers. It seems to her that the Azran Legacy is all he lives for, and he will sacrifice anyone to uncover it. To this end, she wants the professor to reform Bronev however he can and leaves Luke behind, hoping this act will achieve this goal. Together, Layton, Luke, and Descole take turns solving puzzles to pursue Bronev through the sanctuary. Upon saving Luke's life at the expense of injury and near-death, Descole reveals his true identity as Layton's older brother, who was separated from him at a young age when their parents - their father is Leon Bronev himself - were kidnapped by Targent. Layton then recalls memories that he involuntarily suppressed when he was very young: Descole was born Hershel Bronev but gave his first name to his little brother before they were adopted so the latter could be adopted by the Layton family and grow up a happy life without remembering the Bronev family history. Descole's malice towards Layton was merely to prevent him from being hurt as a result of getting in the way of Targent, against which he holds a personal vendetta.\n\nWhen Bronev unlocks the \"legacy\" by stabbing Aurora through the heart within the \"Chamber of Light\" at the center of the Azran sanctuary, the Azran legacy is revealed to be not a source of great power, as Bronev had expected, but to be the resting place of the Golems, an advanced race created by the Azran that became sentient and declared war on the Azran, ultimately becoming the reason for the Azrans' demise; as such, their creators froze them away in ice in order to prevent this from happening again. Aurora reveals that she is a Golem herself, created to be the emissary of the Azran, the one who would judge the worth of the human race in the future. The unleashing of the Golems by Bronev has erased all of mankind's worth in the eyes of the Azran, leading Aurora to order a devastating attack on Froenborg and the Targent military. She soon wakes up, though, distraught at the atrocities happening around her. To prevent mankind's annihilation, Layton, Luke, Emmy, Descole, and ultimately Bronev all sacrifice themselves to stop the procedure by stepping in beams of light, activating the procedure and killing them all. Saddened, Aurora begs the Azran spirits to take her instead, which they do after she solves a death-reversing puzzle, reviving the group and causing the sanctuary to crumble from the sky into Lake Kodh. Before her self-destruction, Aurora thanks Layton and Luke for everything they've done and states that she cherished every moment spent with them. She leaves telling Luke that she hopes she can be reborn as a human. As the sanctuary crumbles, Layton, Luke, Emmy, and Bronev fall to earth on one piece of the sanctuary, while Descole does so on another, bidding farewell to his brother.\n\nBronev is apprehended by the police, after informing Layton that his real name is, in fact, Theodore Bronev, not Hershel Layton. Layton denies this and wishes to keep his adoptive name, refusing to recognize Bronev as his real father. Layton states that, to him, his parents are Roland and Lucille, but he hopes that he and Bronev can meet again as friends and fellow archaeologists one day.\n\nBack in London, Emmy bids an emotional farewell to Layton, passing the role of his assistant to Luke, and promises to return when she is worthy of her place as Layton's assistant once again. Descole is last seen having apparently survived the collapse of the Azran sanctuary as he flies away with Raymond on a restored Bostonius, searching for a new purpose in life. The game ends with Luke and Layton driving in the countryside as they plan to solve an inheritance dispute. As Luke looks through the window, the village of St. Mystere appears on the horizon, setting up the plot for \"Professor Layton and the Curious Village\".\n\nSimilar to previous games, Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy is a puzzle game split into various chapters. The game follows Professor Layton and his friends as they explore various environments and solve many puzzles. Gameplay is similar to that of \"Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask\", in which players utilise the stylus on the touchscreen to search environments for clues and solve the various puzzles the game has to offer. In certain areas, it is possible to zoom into areas with the magnifying glass, to get a closer look at things. The game features over 500 new puzzles, more than its predecessor, in which there were 515. Hint coins can also be found and used to help the player solve a puzzle if they are stuck. Throughout the game, you can also unlock minigames which appear in the trunk including Nutty Roller, Dress Up and Bloom Burst. Gameplay involves travel to different parts of the world, such as the United States of America, South Africa, and Russia.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by Tomohito Nishiura. The ending theme, entitled \"Surely Someday\", was performed by Miho Fukuhara.\n\n\"Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy\" received \"generally favorable\" reception, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n"}

UNAIDS estimate there are 46,630 sex workers in the country. Many have turned to prostitution because of poverty.\n\nSome Nigerian prostitutes ply their trade on the Niger border as many prostitutes are persecuted in their homeland and Niger is perceived as being more amiable and less likely to prosecute them for their trade. Nigerian men prefer to cross the border to seek sex as the punishment in Islamic Nigeria is 50 lashes for \"procuration of woman\".\n\nIn 2017 the government ordered a clampdown on prostitution throughout the country.\n\nHIV is a problem in the country. Preventative measures, including distribution of condoms have seen prevalence rates fall in recent years. Sex workers are one of the high risk groups. In 2016 UNAIDS estimated there was a 17% prevalence rate amongst sex workers.\n\nNiger is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Victims from Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, and Togo are exploited in sex trafficking in Niger. Corrupt marabouts or loosely organised clandestine networks may also place Nigerien girls into commercial sex. Nigerien girls are subjected to sex trafficking along the border with Nigeria, sometimes with the complicity of their families. In the Tahoua region of Niger, some girls in forced marriages may be exploited in commercial sex after fleeing these nominal unions. In Algeria, Nigerien women and girls were vulnerable to sex trafficking.\n\nNigerien women and children are recruited from Niger and transported to Nigeria, North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe where they are subjected to sex trafficking. Some migrants were suspected to be traffickers, particularly Nigerien migrants to Algeria. Traffickers operated primarily small, freelance operations in loosely organised networks of individuals, including some marabouts. There have been reports of freelance business people (both men and women) and informal travel agencies that recruit women to the Middle East or to northern Nigeria for sex trafficking. Niger is a transit country for women and children from West and Central Africa migrating to North Africa and Western Europe, where some are subjected to sex trafficking. In some instances, law enforcement and border officials have accepted bribes from traffickers to facilitate the transportation of victims through the country.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Niger as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country.\n\n"}

This is accomplished by building towers that shoot at, damage and kill the enemy creeps before they are able to reach their objective. Unlike many other tower defense games, the path of the creeps themselves is not set; instead, the towers built determine the path of the creeps, who take the shortest path they can find to the exit. The game does not allow the player to make an exit completely inaccessible, but key strategies revolve around guiding creeps into lengthy, meandering corridors.\n\nThe creeps come in waves at set intervals. Each wave of creeps has different characteristics defined by the map. Several times during gameplay, boss waves may appear depending on the map creator's implementation decisions.\n\nThe player begins with a set number of lives (again, defined by the map), and loses X number of lives for each creep that survives to reach its goal (depending on the defined impact of every creep in that map). The game will end early in defeat if the player′s lives reach zero, and it provides no way to regenerate lost lives.\n\nThe game is played on a chosen map in the game. Maps can be created by players in the game through the inbuilt map-editor. In general, the maps define the game itself by defining basically all of the functionality.\n\nSeveral updates are being worked on. One of these updates is promised to deliver a map-cloud sharing system which will allow players to rate other maps and upload their own. Furthermore, new maps will be added including the \"Wintermaul V5\" map - a famous map from the Warcraft III universe. On top of this, multiplayer gameplay will be a part of the game.\n\n"}

{"id": "41015991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41015991", "title": "Telecommunications lease", "text": "Telecommunications lease\n\nA telecommunications lease is a lease that exists between a telecommunications provider or wireless company, and a landowner. Similar to other real estate leases, a telecommunications lease is put in place as an agreement to lease space on the landowner’s property for a telecommunications site or cellular tower for a specified length of time. In exchange for the use of space, the telecommunications provider (also referenced as a tenant) agrees to pay the landowner (a monthly or annual) rent. Telecom leases can be excellent sources of ancillary income, in some cases providing the landowner with thousands of dollars per month.\n\nThe telecommunication industry is growing as the need for 4G and 5G networks flourishes. As a result of this growth there is a constant demand for cellular networks to increase their coverage. Therefore, more cellular towers are constructed and more leases are drawn up between the cellular provider and landowners, which can include municipalities and private landowners, such as homeowners.\n\nIn the telecommunications industry, there are two types of telecommunications leases: a rooftop lease agreement and a ground lease agreement. In some cases, cellular sites are installed on the roofs of commercial office buildings and even residential living complexes. These rooftop installations take advantage of the height of the buildings on which they are installed to provide quality cellular coverage. Ground leases, on the other hand are contracts typically made between the cellular provider and the landowner of a property for space at the ground level on which a cellular tower is installed.\n\nRooftops are leased for many different communication purposes, including many different types of antennas. Panel antennas are commonly placed on rooftops in urban and densely populated residential areas. These antennas typically range from 1–10 feet in height and have the ability to service multiple technologies, including: cellular antennas, PCS antennas, specialized mobile radios, fixed wireless services, and paging services.\n\nSatellite dishes are also mounted on some rooftops, primarily for satellite TV service, but in other cases much larger dishes are used. These antennas generally address Internet and cable needs and therefore are used for services such as video conferencing.\n\nRooftop leases include details about the amount of space leased, installation methods, and upgrade procedures that allow the tenant to operate at the site as needed, while protecting the landlords building.\n\nGround leases generally address antenna towers or billboards in which the landowner leases the space, or land, to the cellular provider to build the tower. Antenna towers range between 50 and 300 feet tall. These large, free standing cellular towers can sometimes be “disguised” to blend in with the natural architecture of the building or the surrounding landscape. An example of this is a church property that may have a tower built to resemble, or in some cases built into an existing steeple. Alternatively, a property owner for another type of property may have a monopine or monopalm cellular structure. These are built to resemble pine or palm trees respectively.\n\nCellular providers such as Verizon Wireless and AT&T most commonly use ground leases.\n\nProposals for new cell towers sometimes face public opposition in zoning proceedings from residents who raise aesthetic objections and fear health hazards.\n\nLocal zoning boards must follow the rules set forth in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. which sets guidelines for what are acceptable reasons to not permit the construction of a new cellular tower.\n\nGenerally cellular providers look for property that is in a densely populated area and that falls outside of a five-mile radius from the nearest tower. For a cellular company, redundancy occurs when two or more towers serve the same area. This often causes a loss of income for the cellular provider, as they generally need one tower rather than multiple. As companies continue to merge, redundancy has become a rising issue within the telecommunication industry.\n\nGenerally, telecom leases are for an initial five-year term followed by additional five-year renewal terms. Leases typically also have a 30- to 90-day cancellation period when the cellular provider has the right to terminate the lease within 30 to 90 days of giving notice to the landowner. This specific portion of a telecom lease is due to recent mergers in the industry, which render some towers useless. Due to cellular providers merging with other cellular companies, one company can double its number of towers. This often causes redundancy, as previously mentioned, which often leads to the termination of leases and removal of redundant towers.\n\nThe fair market value of a lease is generally determined by the importance of the location to the cellular carrier's network, or the value of the coverage the location provides. Value will also be driven by the availability of surrounding alternate sites. Determining the fair market value of a cellular lease is difficult for most landowners due to lack of available information. Cell tower lease rates are not public information, and these rates vary widely. There are however companies that specialize in providing information and assistance to property owners in this highly specialized field.\n\nIn order to make money, cellular carriers often undervalue a lease. Leasing agents typically receive bonuses for signing low-priced leases, and therefore undervalue leases because the worse the deal is for the landowner, the greater the benefits are for the leasing agent. There are several methods for a landowner to evaluate their property:\n\nCollocation is when the cellular company allows other companies to build on their tower. As a result, the cellular company that owns the tower receives a rent from the co-locators. Within a lease, landowners can address collocation and receive a portion of the rent received by the cellular company.\n\nProperty owners have the ability to sell their cell tower lease separate from their parcel. Investors purchase the cell tower lease as an easement or lease assignment. Three main factors that influence cell tower buyout prices are: current rent, the rent escalator, and the date of lease expiration.\n\nDifferent types of cell tower lease buyout offers have different implications for landowners. For example, a cell tower lease buyout on farmland is much different than the purchase of a lease on a building rooftop. Some necessary considerations for cell tower lease buyout transactions are:\n\nThe challenges of selling a cellular leasehold is the acquisition market is highly unregulated. Lease Acquisition agents have the ability to modify and deliver information to the landowner to acquire leaseholds at a highly discounted price. Similar the oil barons of the 1800s, these agents are compensated heavily to obtain these rights, and often the underlying value of expiration and an expanded sale market is shielded from the landowner.\n"}

One typical television show common to almost every network is \"sinetron\" Sinetron is usually a drama series, following the soap opera format, but can also refer to any fictional series. Sometimes it can be comedic, like the popular Bajaj Bajuri series, featuring a \"bajaj\" driver and the people he drives around.\n\nThe first time the Indonesian public witnessed the demonstration of a television was in 1955, 29 years after its introduction in 1926, and 26 years after the world's first television broadcast was made in 1929. These first televisions were brought from the Soviet Union during the Yogyakarta 200 years anniversary fair (\"Pekan Raja 200 Tahun Kota Djogjakarta\").\n\nOn July 25, 1961, the Minister of Information, R. Maladi, signed an agreement (\"SK Menpen\") to create a committee for the preparation of the establishment of television in Indonesia. This was established as a part of the preparation for the fourth Asian Games. There was only a year to create a studio, broadcast tower, and other technical equipments in the former site of the Information Academy at Senayan. In that short period of preparation, Soekarno had a very prominent role, going as far as to personally choosing the equipment and where they should be imported from. The first experimental TV broadcast was the live coverage of the celebration of the 17th Anniversary of Indonesia's Independence on the morning August 17, 1962 from Jakarta's Merdeka Palace.\n\nAt 14.30, August 24, 1962, the citizens of Jakarta witnessed the live broadcast of the opening ceremony of the 4th Asian Games from Gelora Bung Karno. This broadcast was held by the Television Division of the Radio and Television Organizing Committee Bureau. This day is now recognized as the birth of \"Televisi Republik Indonesia\" or TVRI, the first television station in Indonesia.\n\nOn October 20, 1963, the government issued a Presidential Decision (\"Keppres\") regarding the formation of the TVRI Foundation (\"Jajasan TVRI\") as its governing body. In the first year of the TVRI broadcast, there are 10,000 television owners in Indonesia. Since then, the Foundation allotted a tax for television-owners until 1969, when the television property tax was transferred through mail and air deliveries nationwide. From 1963 to 1976, TVRI established television stations in Yogyakarta (1965), Medan (1970), Makassar (1972), Balikpapan (1973), and Palembang (1974). In 2001, TVRI has 12 television stations and 8 production studios. Color broadcasting was introduced on September 1, 1979 on TVRI's national and local stations, which expanded to other provincial capitals. TVRI also adopted a second channel for Jakarta viewers at the same time.\n\nAdvertisements were introduced to TVRI on March 1, 1963 to cope with the increasing broadcast hours. This advertisement was known as \"Siaran Niaga\" (literally \"advertisement broadcast\"). Now, television advertisements and other general advertisings are known simply as \"iklan\" (\"advertisement\").\n\nOn August 16, 1976, the Domestic Satellite Communication System (\"Sistem Komunikasi Satelit Domestik\" or SKSD) through Palapa A1 was inaugurated. This communication satellite was the first satellite owned by Indonesia and one of the first satellite operated by a developing country. Palapa A1 had 12 transponders which allows TVRI to distribute its broadcast reach nationally. Thus TVRI entered the 1980s with a two-channel system, the first, TVRI Nasional, being broadcast nationwide with the second channel broadcasting local content from the provinces and Jakarta.\n\nOn January 5, 1980, President Soeharto issued an instruction to remove the \"Siaran Niaga\" advertisements from TVRI. The reason for this is from the belief that advertisements may create negative effects for the development of Indonesia during that time. This instructions had created pros and cons, especially because there is no research behind this statement. One month later, the Department of Information's Research and Department division decided to perform a research about the effect of advertisements to national development programs aired within the TVRI network. In March 1980, the ban on commercial advertisements was lifted.\n\nAs the only TV station in Indonesia for many years, aside from coverage of state events, sessions of the People's Consultative Assembly and national holidays, as well as educational programming and regional programs in the many regional languages, TVRI had also broadcast entertainment, child-oriented and sports programmes to suit the needs of the viewing public. As part of the plans of the Fifth Development Cabinet, however, noticing how its ASEAN neighbours had operated private television channels with success (Malaysia had its by then sole private TV channel, TV3, which opened in 1984 and the Philippines and Thailand also had private TV stations in conjunction with the state networks, while TVRI was by then in the same situation as in Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia and Brunei which all had only a state TV channel), the door was opened for the formation of private television stations and an end to the TVRI monopoly. On August 24, 1989, the second television station in Indonesia, Rajawali Citra Televisi Indonesia or RCTI, was inaugurated. This was the nation's first privately owned television station. The television station was owned by Bambang Trihatmodjo. Unlike TVRI, RCTI was allowed to broadcast advertisements up to 15% its broadcast hours. On August 24, 1990, the third television station, Surya Citra Televisi or SCTV, formerly Surabaya Centra Televisi, was inaugurated. This television station was owned by \"king of cineplex\" Sudwikatmono.\n\nOn September 13, 1990, the president issued Presidential Decree no. 40 regarding the television property tax collection between \"Yayasan TVRI\" and PT Mekatama Raya, a private company owned by Sudwikatmono and Sigit Hardjojudanto. Since the beginning of 1991, this private company was the responsible body to withdraw television property tax from people. The reason for this change is to increase revenue from the lower 1969 post and air mail system.\n\nOn January 23, 1991, PT Cipta Televisi Pendidikan Indonesia (TPI) started its broadcast of educational programs with some advertisements. The company was led by Siti Hardjanti. During its first years, TPI shared channels with TVRI and as a blocktimer then with the channel, its facility and operational staff, whenever TVRI did not broadcast, were supported by the channel.\n\nOn April 14, 1992, the Directorate General of Radio, Television and Films decided that Yayasan TVRI will withdrew back the television property tax from the people when, after one year, PT Mekatama Raya failed to increase the revenue.\n\nOn October 1992, the Minisrtry of Information issued licenses for six companies to established private television firms: PT Indosiar Visual Mandiri or Indosiar (Jakarta), PT Sanitya Mandara Televisi (Yogyakarta), PT Merdeka Citra Televisi Indonesia (Semarang), PT Ramako Indotelevisi (Batam), PT Cakrawala Andalas Televisi or ANTV (Lampung), and PT Cakrawala Bumi Sriwijaya Televisi (Palembang). Of all these six television companies, only PT Indosiar Visual Mandiri and PT Cakrawala Andalas Televisi were able to broadcast continuously. On February 28, 1993, PT Cakrawala Andalas Televisi, a joint venture between Agung Laksono and the Bakrie family, started its first broadcast. The broadcast station was initially planned to be located in Lampung, but later moved to Jakarta, in a building at Kuningan. PT Indosiar Visual Mandiri, owned by Salim Group, started its first broadcast on January 11, 1995.\n\nIn March 1998, TV Kabel Indovision, operated by PT Matahari Lintas Cakrawala under the leadership of Peter F. Gontha, started its operation as the first cable television in Indonesia (the first cable television was operated in the United States in 1972). Previously, since 1996, Indovision had operated using television decoders and parabolic antennas.\n\nIn October 1999, out of fourteen applicants that had been received by Department of Information, five television broadcasting companies passed the selection and received broadcast licenses. These companies are: Trans TV (PT Televisi Transformasi Indonesia, led by Ishadi, the former head of TVRI), MetroTV (operated by Grup Media Indonesia which was led by Surya Paloh), Global TV (PT Global Informasi Bermutu, established by Timmy Habibie), Lativi (PT Lativi Media Karya, owned by Abdul Latief), and TV7 (PT Duta Visual Nusantara Tivi Tujuh). Metro TV was the first to broadcast on November 25, 2000, as the seventh Indonesian television channel\n\nOn June 7, 2000, following the changes after the dissolution of the Department of Information by President Abdurrahman Wahid, TVRI was officially able to change its status into a Service Company (\"Perusahaan Jawatan\").\n\nThe use of Chinese was banned from 1965 to 1994 in Indonesian television, but its use did not come until years later. In November 2000, after more than 3 decades, Metro TV would become the first to broadcast news in Mandarin Chinese to the Indonesian Chinese community.\n\nTerrestrial TV started with the establishment of the first television station in Indonesia. Indonesia only has one television channel until the establishment of RCTI is a first private television in Indonesia. Currently, the major national free-to-air terrestrial television stations in Indonesia are TVRI, RCTI, SCTV, MNCTV, ANTV, Indosiar, MetroTV, Trans TV, Trans7, tvOne, GTV, Kompas TV, NET., RTV, and iNews, O Channel dan INTV (Indonesia). Since Q1 2011 the authority allow (Indonesian) digital television simulcast with analog television in some area. Indonesia adopted DVB-T format but decided to change to DVB-T2 on 1 January 2012.\n\nSatellite television has been available in Indonesia since Indovision, now known as MNC Vision, incorporated on 8 August 1988 and officially launched on 16 January 1994. Since then, technology for satellite television has changed from analogue to digital. Satellite television in Indonesia using digital video broadcasting-satellite format. Up to now, there are more than five satellite pay TV operators:\nMNC Vision, Transvision, Skynindo, OrangeTV, Topas TV, K-Vision and BiG TV. Free satellite television is available nationwide through various satellites, such as Palapa-D and Telkom-1.\n\nPT Broadband Multimedia Tbk is the first operator for cable TV in Indonesia under the brand name \"Kabelvision\" on 16 January 1994. In 2006, the company launched Digital 1 along with the technology changed from analogue to digital. The company then change the name of the company to PT First Media Tbk on 8 September 2007 and also launched new brand, name First Media. Cable TV now is only available in Jabodetabek, Surabaya, and Bandung area. Cable TV in Indonesia is using digital video broadcasting-cable format.\n\nMobile TV has two categories, free-to-air and Pay TV. Free-to-air TV available for years in Indonesia. Free-to-air is using analogue technology like UHF/VHF. Now free-to-air TV has adopted digital technology. In Indonesia, free-to-air TV is using digital video broadcasting-handheld format.\n\nThere is only one operator for Mobile Pay TV in Indonesia. Mobile TV is currently only available in Jakarta.\n\nMost viewed channels in Q1 2012.\n\n"}

The film was directed by Richard Shepard, who co-wrote the script with Tamar Brott.\n\nLucy (Arquette) is a young woman who works at a restaurant in Manhattan. She is constantly annoyed by her gambling, egotistical bosses. She has an ambition to be an escape artist, specifically a modern female version of Harry Houdini, with her best friend, Vivian (Balint) as her assistant. Lucy also collects anything that once belonged to Mrs. Houdini.\n\nThe movie starts with Lucy questioning who the new bartender (Bowie) is. She finds out his name is Monte, he's from Britain and will tell any lie in order to get a woman to marry him. He makes it clear he only wants to marry because he is in dire need of a green card, because if he doesn't and has to go back to Britain, he will surely die. The two chat, with Monte desperately asking Lucy out for breakfast, even though Lucy doesn't want to.\n\nLater on, Lucy is practising an escape trick when she loses her balance and becomes trapped by the noose she was planning to escape from. Her wrists and ankles are both cuffed, meaning Lucy can't free herself. She cries herself to sleep after having not been able to reach the key that unlocks the cuffs. She is awoken in the morning by a phone call. She struggles to answer it but manages to by kicking the phone onto the ground so she can hear it. It's Monte wanting to take her out for breakfast, having found her number in the Yellow Pages. Lucy begs him to come to her apartment to untie her. He frees her legs and unties the noose but will only free her hands on the condition that she marries him. Lucy, unsettled, declines, so Monte handcuffs Lucy to himself and the bed before falling asleep, with an upset Lucy following suit.\n\nVivian enters the apartment the following morning to find Monte and Lucy asleep on the bed, handcuffed. Vivian unlocks Lucy but leaves the handcuffs on Monte. He later arises and eats a marshmallow for breakfast whilst the girls whisper in the bathroom about who gets to sleep with him.\n\nLater on, Viv and Lucy ride to an antique shop where Lucy has her eye on Mrs. Houdini's wedding ring. Lucy will do anything to have it, but is unable to purchase it, as she doesn't have the $5,000 to pay for it. Lucy wonders how she can get the money. She decides to rob the restaurant after her bosses, Dante (Gregory) and Cecil (Henry) once again decide to fine the waitresses if they don't sell enough desserts. Monte is also present at the meeting, with one of his hands still cuffed.\n\nVivian goes to the restaurant to tell Lucy some big news: a designer is interested in meeting Viv to discuss her line of lingerie. The only problem is, Viv can only meet with the designer the following day at 3:00. This is a problem because Lucy has an audition for her escape trick, and Viv is her assistant. After an argument, Vivian storms off to go and talk to Monte, who's serving at the bar. Jealous, Lucy unlocks Monte from the handcuff and agrees to go out with him if he'll be her assistant at the audition; he accepts.\n\nMonte has his doubts about Lucy, so he strikes a deal with Jeanette (Matlin), a deaf colleague: Jeanette will marry him if he pays her $10,000. This leads to a conversation Monte has on the phone with his friend. Lucy overhears the conversation and decides to eavesdrop. He explains to his friend his intention to rob the restaurant, and asks his friend to help, who declines.\n\nLucy confronts Monte while they are waiting for her turn at the audition. Both become frustrated because they both want to rob the restaurant at the same time. Lucy is called up and begins her escape routine. Unfortunately, the audition goes disastrously as she cannot find the key to free herself. Lucy is obviously upset so Monte takes her to a bar where they discuss who's going to rob the restaurant. They can't work together, as that would mean splitting the money, and Monte needs it all to pay Jeanette. Monte comes up with another plan: he will help Lucy rob the restaurant if she marries him. This way, Monte won't need the $10,000 to pay Jeanette.\n\nLucy begins to cry again so Monte tries to cheer her up by talking about Mrs. Houdini. Lucy, still upset, explains that Mrs. Houdini was vital to Harry Houdini's escape routines: before Mr. Houdini commenced with his trick, Mrs. Houdini would kiss him and transfer the key he needed to escape from her mouth to his. Lucy's mood has improved somewhat after this so the two walk down the street and discuss the possibility of sleeping together. Monte wants to, but Lucy declines and explains Viv was hoping to sleep with him first. With Viv in mind, he suggests that a third person that doesn't work at the restaurant and wouldn't be recognised would be ideal for the robbery. Lucy agrees and the two head to Vivian's apartment, where she's working on her 'self-defence bra'.\n\nIt's later on when the trio discuss the plan: at 12:00 AM, Viv will enter the restaurant and demand money, which she will take from the register. To appear more threatening, she will carry a gun which fires blanks. It's vitally important that it happens before the 12:30 AM drop. Monte and Lucy will create some clever diversions so that the guests will be on edge. At 11:59, they will drop a loud set of glasses to really unsettle the guests; seconds later, Viv will enter. Viv reluctantly agrees and takes the gun from Monte.\n\nAt 11:59, Monte and Lucy drop the champagne bottles and glasses... But Viv doesn't show up. Thinking she has dropped out, Monte storms off, and Lucy follows. She finds him in the freezer causing havoc and messing the room up. With adrenaline rushing through him, he makes out with Lucy. As it turns out, Viv had a flat tyre on her bike, so by the time she turns up in a disguise to commence the robbery the guests are calm and don't take her seriously. She makes threats but the guests laugh at her, so she pretends she's a performing artist and the stunt was part of her act.\n\nIn the freezer, Lucy flees the room, leaving Monte confused. She tracks down Vivian, who explains what happened. The situation is desperate and 12:30 looms, so Viv fires the gun, exclaiming, 'Sorry, I guess I wasn't kidding... Money. Now. All of it.' Jeanette, who works at the register, can't understand Vivian because the disguise is covering her face. Annoyed, Viv presses a button on her bra, which causes two knife-like spikes to stick out of it. Jeanette is fascinated and happily hands over a bag of money. Lucy and Monte leave the restaurant and later all three of them can be seen throwing money into the air, celebrating.\n\nExpecting Lucy to uphold her side of the deal, Monte heads to the Register Office and waits for her. Meanwhile, Lucy heads back to the antique shop to buy the ring, only to find it has been sold. She heads over to Viv's apartment to mope. Viv's in a cheerful mood, however: since the robbery, companies have been calling her about her 'self-defence bra'. Lucy doesn't share the enthusiasm. Viv asks if she and Monte tied the knot. Lucy realises she completely forgot, so she and Vivian rush to the Register Office.\n\nThe girls arrive and Monte whisks Lucy away, but they are not able to marry because she left her I.D. at Viv's apartment. There is simply no time to get married any other day, so Monte leaves in anger. The two girls leave, too, and Lucy, full of guilt, confesses to Vivian that she made out with Monte. The two talk about him before deciding to head to a bar and get drunk.\n\nMonte, meanwhile, is at the restaurant when Cecil and Dante approach him. It is revealed that Monte didn't need to get married to get his green card, but because he made a $2,000,000 bet with Cecil and Dante. We also learn that Monte has a terrible gambling problem. He manages to convince them to give him another chance, and they make another bet: Lucy will have one minute to escape from a straitjacket, hanging upside down, with her feet cuffed, inside a locked canvas bag, underwater (In Cecil and Dante's giant aquarium at the restaurant). If she is unable to, Monte will owe them $4,000,000, or, he will undergo plastic surgery to make himself look like Dante.\n\nOf course, Monte can't win without Lucy's help. He arrives at Lucy's apartment, where the two girls are asleep. He wakes them up and discovers they have serious hangovers. Worried that they won't help him, Monte makes up a story, 'Cecil and Dante know about the robbery... I don't know how they found out... There's still hope. I made a deal- a bet-a bet with Cecil and Dante: if we win, they drop all charges, like nothing ever happened... [If we lose,] 20 years hard labour'. Vivian and Monte believe that they can train Lucy, but quickly, for the stunt is to be performed the following night. Lucy trains for hours, and before long, the three fall asleep, exhausted. Vivian wakes up in the early hours of the morning and leaves, which, in turn, causes Monte and Lucy to wake up. Lucy wants to get up and train, but Monte convinces her to stay, and the two make love in Lucy's apartment.\n\nLater in the morning, Lucy is out shopping and sees Cecil and Dante driving past in a taxi. She tries to avoid them, but they drag her into the vehicle so they can rant about their excitement for the bet. After a bit of chatting, Lucy finds out that Cecil and Dante don't know who committed the robbery, even though Monte told her they knew. She discovers that Monte will have to pay Cecil and Dante $4,000,000 (or get plastic surgery) if he doesn't win the bet, even though Monte told her they'd go to jail if the bet was lost. Lucy is visibly shocked and asks the driver to stop before climbing out of the taxi.\n\nIt's the night of the bet and Monte is nervous, particularly because Lucy hasn't showed up. Monte learns that Cecil and Dante told her the truth about the bet. He now doubts that she will show, but begs the two men to stall the audience until she comes, so they do. Lucy finally shows up, surprising Cecil, Dante, and Monte. After an awkward arrival, she puts on the straitjacket, has her legs cuffed, and is almost in the canvas bag when Monte interrupts, wanting a 'goodbye kiss'. Lucy, still angry at him, refuses, until she sees he has Mrs. Houdini's wedding ring between his teeth.\n\nLucy is locked in the bag, suspended upside down, and dropped into the water. She appears to be struggling to escape when several gun shots fire. It's Vivian, dressed in a red disguise but with the same black veil covering her face. She presses her 'self-defence bra' and the spikes once again stick out. She demands money and the audience give it to her whilst Monte stares in shock. Jeanette also gives her two bags of money from the register.\n\nWhen Viv leaves, the attention turns back to Lucy. The canvas bag is still in the water. Monte- aware that if he tries to save her, he will lose the bet- jumps into the water, before finding out that the bag is devoid of Lucy. The audience is confused until they find her on the second level of the restaurant, dripping from the water but otherwise fine.\n\nLater on, Monte is still somewhat damp but approaches Lucy nonetheless. She's less angry with him since he risked $4,000,000 to save her, but she shakes his hand and prepares to leave him for the last time. Monte calls her back and asks if she will go out with him the following day, but this time, it's for real. The two kiss before Lucy leaves. Outside, Viv is waiting by two new bikes from Cecil and Dante and the movie ends with the two girls riding down the dark street.\n\n\nIman and Julian Lennon have brief cameos in the movie.\n\nThe movie was released to VHS in 1992.\n\nReviews of the movie were mostly negative. \"Empire\" magazine gave the movie one star out of five, calling it \"an unbearably protracted dud\". \"Variety\" magazine called the movie an \"uninspired, poverty row production\" and lamented the mis-casting of Bowie in the lead role. In contrast, Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" gave the film a positive review, and approved of Bowie's casting. \"TV Guide\" gave the movie 2 stars out of 5.\n\n\n"}

It is now one of the world’s largest archives of British Theatre History. It is a fully accredited Archive and Museum and home to the Live Art Archive. \n\nThe Theatre Collection was established in 1951 following a symposium led by Glynne Wickham which called for Universities to endorse the policy of studying drama in the context of theatre. Wickham instigated the purchase of its first acquisitions and laid the foundations for the Theatre Collection with funds awarded to the University of Bristol by the Rockefeller Foundation. From the outset it was designed to be a working collection of theatre history, to serve scholars and practising theatre artists alike. \n\nIn 1969 the University made an award from its Appeal Fund to provide the Collection with adequate storage and access facilities within the Department of Drama. The first official keeper of the Theatre Collection was Anne Brooke Barnett (died 2009) who managed the holdings from 1966 to 1989. The Assistant Keeper from 1971 until Anne Brooke Barnett's retirement was Christopher Robinson (died 2003), who succeeded her and was Keeper until his own retirement in 1999. \n\nIn 2010 the Theatre Collection received a funding allocation from The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to support it being accessible to the wider Higher Education community. Benefactors have also supported the work of the Theatre Collection.\n\nIn 2001 the University of Bristol Theatre Collection was awarded Registered museum status, followed in 2009 by full Accredited Museum status, by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, as recognised by the Arts Council of England.

Their accreditation report concluded that: “Bristol University Theatre Collection has an exceptionally strong grasp of its broad network of stakeholders, and their needs.

Students, academics, and independent researchers can access the reference library and archival collections in the main reading room. Arranging an appointment in advance is highly recommended to facilitate object retrieval, particularly as some of the holdings are stored off-site. \n\nThe small exhibition area showcases aspects of the collections and is open to the general public.\n\n"}
