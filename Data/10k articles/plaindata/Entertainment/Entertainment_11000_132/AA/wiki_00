{"id": "24973570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24973570", "title": "81 Words", "text": "81 Words\n\n\"81 Words\" is an episode of the popular public radio program, \"This American Life\", which is broadcast from Chicago Public Radio. This episode was originally aired January 18, 2002. The episode is narrated by Alix Spiegel, who was the recipient of the George Foster Peabody Award, the Livingston Award, and the Dupont Award. She won the 2002 Livingston Award in National Reporting for the 204th episode of \"This American Life\", \"81 Words\". The program is hosted by Ira Glass, who gives the introduction for the episode stating, \n\"It's just uncanny, I think that's the word. It's just uncanny when something so small, for a moment, for the length of time it takes to sign [he is referring to a pen used to sign major U.S. legal documents] can carry the entire weight of history of a nation. Today's radio program is about something small like that, that was at the epicenter of massive social change in our country for a brief moment.\"\n\nThe episode is split into two acts. The first act explains that in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) declared that homosexuality was not a disease, by changing the 81-word definition of sexual deviance in its own reference manual. It was a change that attracted a lot of attention at the time, but the story of what led up to that change is one that was reported by Spiegel. Part one of Spiegel's story details the activities of a closeted group of gay psychiatrists within the APA who met in secret and called themselves the GAYPA ... and another, even more secret group of gay psychiatrists among the political echelons of the APA. Spiegel's own grandfather was among these psychiatrists, and the president-elect of the APA at the time of the change. Alix Spiegel states in the beginning of the story that, \"...I know this story not because I read it in a book or learned it in any class, but because it's one of those stories that my family uses to explain itself.\" The story begins with a recording of John P. Spiegel interviewing himself in which he talks about how he has been asked to travel to Ireland to work with a gay activist who is trying to change the Irish constitution. Spiegel was asked to testify as an expert in mental health. Dr. Spiegel was asked to testify about the mental health of homosexuals. Oddly enough he was a homosexual who had not told anyone. He was asked to do this because he was the president elect of the American Psychiatric Association in 1973. It stated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) that homosexuality was termed sexual deviance and that homosexuals were pathological. This gave the country the right to treat homosexuals differently. Alix Spiegel's family had always told the story of Dr. Spiegel as one that expressed him as the sole person to abolish the 81 word definition of homosexuality from the DSM, until a family vacation after Dr. Spiegel's wife had died, when he emerged from a beach bungalow with a much younger man that was later introduced to a shocked family as his lover.\n\nThe second act of the radio program explains the history of homosexuality in psychological terms and gives the conclusion to the story. At the same time that Dr. Spiegel is working in Ireland, a few gay activists began to make protests to try to get the designation of homosexuality changed. The story from this point gives a history of homosexuality, from its original state as a crime against the will of God, to it being a form of insanity, then stating it was just faulty wiring. The story continues by talking about Dr. Irving Bieber, who started doing a lot of tests with homosexuals. Dr. Bieber tried to find the cause for homosexuality in a psychological sense. The story continues to talk about the group of gay activists that worked inside of the APA, that had a large part to do with the changing of the 81 word definition. The GAYPA worked in the APA to get Dr. Robert Spitzer (the head of the APA) to rewrite the 81 word definition. The story ends with Dr. John P. Spiegel, president-elect of the APA, accepting the new definition of homosexuality.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8562541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8562541", "title": "Cinema of Austria", "text": "Cinema of Austria\n\nCinema of Austria refers to the film industry based in Austria. Austria has had an active cinema industry since the early 20th century when it was the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and that has continued to the present day. Producer Sascha Kolowrat-Krakowsky, producer-director-writer Luise Kolm and the Austro-Hungarian directors Michael Curtiz and Alexander Korda were among the pioneers of early Austrian cinema. Several Austrian directors pursued careers in Weimar Germany and later in the United States, among them Fritz Lang, G. W. Pabst, Josef von Sternberg, Billy Wilder, Fred Zinnemann, and Otto Preminger.\n\nBetween the two World Wars, directors like E. W. Emo and Henry Koster - the latter of whom had emigrated from Austria, provided examples of Austrian film comedies. At the same time, Willi Forst and Walter Reisch founded the \"Wiener Film\" genre. After Austria had become a part of Nazi Germany in 1938, Vienna's Wien-Film production company became an important studio for seemingly non-political productions. In the aftermath of World War II, Austria's film production soon restarted, partially supported by the Allied Forces. Veteran and new directors such as Ernst Marischka, Franz Antel, Geza von Cziffra, Geza von Bolvary and Walter Kolm-Veltee revised the comedy, provincial Heimatfilm, and biopic traditions, and began a new genre of the opulent imperial epic (e.g. Marischka's \"Sissi\" films and Antel's imperial era musicals) which rivaled Hollywood entertainment at the international box office.\n\nThe 1950s brought Austria the largest film production boom in its history, but without a neorealist or New Wave school, which had revitalized other European cinemas during this era, and with no national subsidies, the commercial Austrian film industry collapsed by 1968 and experimental film remained very limited. By the 1970s, television had become the medium for entertainment film, the short films of the radical Viennese Actionism movement rejected narrative structure completely, and Austria's alpine landscape as well some of its directors and actors were used for West German sex comedy productions.\n\nWith national subsidy arriving in 1981, a new generation of Austrian filmmakers established themselves at home and international festivals in the 1980s and 90s, among them Axel Corti, Niki List, Paul Harather, Michael Haneke, Barbara Albert, Harald Sicheritz, Stefan Ruzowitzky and Ulrich Seidl. In the first decade of the 21st century, Austrian cinema found its long-delayed New Wave and international critical success.\n\nAustrian or Austrian-identifying actors who have achieved international success from the 1920s to the present include Erich von Stroheim, Elisabeth Bergner, Joseph Schildkraut, Paul Henreid, Hedy Lamarr, Walter Slezak, Oskar Homolka, Nadja Tiller, Senta Berger, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Maximilian Schell, Maria Schell, Romy Schneider, Oskar Werner, Vanessa Brown, Gusti Huber, Curd Jürgens, Lotte Lenya, Kurt Kasznar, Marisa Mell, Helmut Berger, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Christoph Waltz.\n\nBetween 1896 and about 1905 the only films produced in Austria were newsreels, mostly by French companies such as Pathé Frères and Gaumont. The first films by an Austrian filmmaker were a series of short erotic movies such as \"Am Sklavenmarkt\" produced by the photographer Johann Schwarzer, who founded the \"Saturn-Film\" company in 1906. Some of his productions have been found and restored in recent years by the Filmarchiv Austria.\n\nMainstream film production began in 1910 when the company \"Erste österreichische Kinofilms-Industrie\", later Wiener Kunstfilm) was founded by Anton Kolm, his wife Luise Kolm, and Jacob Fleck. They started with newsreels but soon began to produce fiction films. In 1912 Count Sascha Kolowrat-Krakowsky, a wealthy nobleman from Bohemia, founded the Sascha-Film company. In the period before 1918 it grew into the largest production company in Austria; its main competitor was Wiener Kunstfilm. After the start of World War I the Austrian film industry grew in strength, as many foreign companies, including those of France's powerful film industry, were no longer allowed to produce or distribute films in Austria. In the period 1914 to 1918, nearly 200 movies were produced in Austria - twice as many as in all the years before.\n\nSome Austrian filmmakers had already emigrated and begun careers in the United States by this time. Erich von Stroheim and Josef von Sternberg were just two of the natives of Austria who contributed to the early success of Hollywood. Lesser known filmmakers who began their career in the US were for example Henry Lehrman, who staged a few hundred slapstick movies, including the first four movies starring Charlie Chaplin. The founder of Fox Film Corporation, William Fox (born as Wilhelm Fuchs) and the first independent producer in Hollywood, Sam Spiegel, were also native Austrians, born as German speaking Jews in Austria-Hungary. The co-founder of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Marcus Loew, was born as son of Jewish emigrants of Austria-Hungary.\n\nAfter the end of World War I, film production continued to grow, because the then Austrian currency, the Krone, was very weak. As a result, Austrian films were cheaper than those from other countries. In the years 1919 to 1922 Austrian film production reached its all-time peak with a yearly output of 100 to 140 films.\n\nMany of the films produced in this period were of a lower quality than those of established film-producing nations like France, Great Britain, Denmark, Germany and Italy. But among the mass of low-grade productions there were also films by producers and directors who attached importance to quality. Consequently, the expressionist style of film-making had its beginnings not only in German but also in Austrian cinema, for example in Paul Czinner's \"Inferno\" (1920). The script of one of the most important German expressionist films, \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1920), was written by two Austrians, Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz. They, along with Fritz Lang and Paul Czinner, also worked in Berlin at that time as Berlin was the centre of the German-language film industry. The Austrian Fritz Kortner, who worked in both Germany and Austria - for example in Austrian pre-expressionist productions such as \"Der Mandarin\" (1918) - was one of the most noted expressionist actors. The best known Austrian expressionist film is \"The Hands of Orlac\" (1924) by German director Robert Wiene which starred Conrad Veidt and Fritz Kortner.\n\nAround 1923 the whole European film industry went into decline due to growing competition from the United States. American films could be exported to Europe very cheaply, because the production costs had already been earned back at the American box-office. The European film industry, divided into many different countries and many different languages, could not produce quality films at a low enough price to compete with the American imports. Another issue which affected Germany and Austria was the successful reining in of hyperinflation. Austrian films were no longer especially cheap and exports fell. As a result, Austrian film production had reduced by the mid-twenties to between 20 and 30 films per year, a level commensurate with its new greatly reduced size after World War I. In the whole silent movie era around 1,000 films were produced in Austria.\n\nThe 1920s were also the age of the epic film, on the model of films of the pre-war period from the United States (for example those of D.W. Griffith) and Italy. In Austria the Austro-Hungarian filmmakers Michael Curtiz and Alexander Korda produced epic films for \"Sascha-Film\" and \"Vita-Film\" (the successor company of \"Wiener Kunstfilm\"), among them \"Prinz und Bettelknabe\" (1920), \"Samson und Delila\" (1922), \"Sodom und Gomorrha\" (1922), \"Der Junge Medardus\" (1923), \"Die Sklavenkönigin\" (1924), \"Harun al Rashid\" (1924) and \"Salammbo\" (1925). These films were the biggest ever produced in Austria, with enormous production costs, up to 10,000 costumed extras, and huge sets such as the \"Temple of Sodom\" which were designed and built by Austria's top set designers of the period, Emil Stepanek, Artur Berger and Julius von Borsody. The who's-who of the Austrian film scene worked on these films. Leading cinematographers like Franz Planer and Hans Theyer photographed the films, and the directors' wives, Lucy Doraine (Michael Curtiz) and Maria Corda (Alexander Korda), were the films' leading ladies. The casts were completed by Austrian film and theatre stars like Hans Thimig, Walter Slezak, Oskar Beregi, Hans Marr. Some film stars of later years, Willi Forst for example, appeared in some of these movies as extras.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1936 Austria was a refuge for many German filmmakers who had emigrated from Nazi Germany, among them directors Erich Engel and Werner Hochbaum.\n\nAlthough Austria was not annexed by Germany until 1938, Jews were forbidden to work in the Austrian film industry from 1936 onwards due to pressure from Nazi Germany where Jews had been banned from film work within months of the Nazis taking power. Germany was the most important export market for Austrian films and Germany had threatened a total ban on Austrian film imports unless the Austrians complied with their demands. The only exception to this ban was, for unknown reasons, the film \"Episode\" (1935) directed by the Jewish Walter Reisch. The majority of Jewish Austrian directors, actors and other employees of the film industry, along with many non-Jewish opponents of the Nazis emigrated in the following years to France, Czechoslovakia, Great Britain and the United States. Some Jewish filmmakers, however, did not emigrate and many died in the Holocaust. Many of the Austrian emigrants went on to successful careers in the United States, notably the directors Billy Wilder, Fred Zinnemann, Otto Preminger, Joe May and Edgar G. Ulmer.\n\nAfter the \"Anschluss\" some filmmakers came to arrangements with the new Nazi leadership, whilst others chose to leave the film business under the Nazis or to hide in the underground - for example the famous costume designer Gerdago who went on to create the costumes for the \"Sissi films\" of the 1950s.\n\nThe whole Austrian film industry was quickly integrated into one company \"Wien-Film\", which was the new name of \"Sascha-Film\" following its confiscation by the Nazis with the help of the \"Creditanstalt\" bank. \"Wien-Film\" produced few openly propagandistic films; the majority of its output was apparently harmless comedies, which often had an antidemocratic and anti-semitic subtext. Although Nazi censorship was strict, a few films contained criticism hidden at a metaphorical level, for example the musical comedies of Willi Forst.\n\nThe period between 1945 and 1970 was the age of musical comedies, which had already become popular in the 1930s, and of \"Heimatfilme\", sentimental films with a rural setting. In the aftermath of World War II Austria's cities were devastated and filmmakers set their works in the countryside to show the population the \"good and beautiful\" Austria. In the 1950s, the age of the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" there was little popular call for serious or critical films; the public preference was for films that displayed a safe environment, an escape from the destruction of recent history. Many of the comedies of the period were set at the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire as this period is identified with luxury, elegance, romance and a vision of Austria as large, powerful and peaceful. This explains the popularity of the \"Sissi\" films starring Romy Schneider as the Empress Elizabeth which found not only domestic but international success. These films were the model for many other Austrian films of the period. Apart from Schneider other Austrian film stars of the 1950s and 1960s were Peter Alexander, Attila Hörbiger, Magda Schneider, Wolf Albach-Retty and Hans Moser. Among the directors, the highly prolific Franz Antel became a household name with his popular comedies.\n\nThe 1970s was the period in which Austrian film production reached its lowest ebb with only five to ten films being produced each year. The reactionary Austrian film industry succumbed to the rise of television whilst at the same time, a new, young, and critical generation of filmmakers - the Austrian avant-garde movement - emerged with productions that were often experimental. Notable avant-garde filmmakers, some of whom had begun working in the late 1950s, included Peter Kubelka, Franz Novotny, Ernst Schmid Jr., Ferry Radax, Kurt Kren, Valie Export, Otto Muehl, and Peter Weibel.\n\nBy around 1980 a new wave of mainstream film production had begun in Austria. With the modern industry having to compete with leisure pursuits like television and computers which did not exist in its heyday of the interwar period and the 1950s, a return to the production levels of those times seems most unlikely. However, the Austrian industry did begin to rediscover different film genres which had been largely forgotten from the 1930s through to the 1960s when sentimental comedies dominated the domestic scene. Whilst comedies remain popular in Austria to this day, the nature of the comedy has changed and dramas have returned to popularity. Other genres such as the action movie, the thriller, the fantasy film and the horror film have not become established in Austria, not least because of their high production costs and reliance on expensive special effects. Austrian films of the 21st Century seldom cost more than 1 to 2 million euros to produce as higher costs could not be earned back in the domestic market and few Austrian films enjoy successful overseas distribution. Simultaneously almost the entire distribution system within Austria is in the hands of the major American film companies who have their own productions to sell. As a result, there is little marketing and publicity for Austrian-made films.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Austrian film industry underwent a number of structural changes. Some directors, both established and upcoming have created their own film-companies to share resources and learn from each other. The other film companies, the biggest of which are \"Dor-Film\" and \"Allegro-Film\", both producing at least two theatrically released films a year, concentrate on commercially oriented productions such as comedies with cabaret stars who enjoy a high profile in the Austrian market. Such comedies, notably Hinterholz 8 and Poppitz, both directed by Harald Sicheritz, have had the highest box-office of any Austrian films in the last 25 years. These companies also produce more challenging films, but only in limited numbers as productions other than comedies are financially risky in Austria unless foreign distribution can be secured.\n\nAustrian films' share of the domestic box-office is one of the lowest in Europe, with only about 3% of cinema admissions going to domestic productions. Every year the annual top ten films at the Austrian box-office are usually all American.\n\nHigh-quality Austrian films, which have won more and more critical acclaim in recent years, are usually produced by small production companies, often in co-production with other countries. Examples of this are \"The Piano Teacher\" and \"Caché\" by Michael Haneke, probably the most famous Austrian director at the current time. Other successful Austrian films (wholly Austrian and co-productions) since 2000 are We Feed the World (Erwin Wagenhofer), Darwin's Nightmare (Hubert Sauper), Calling Hedy Lamarr (Georg Misch), \"Grbavica\" (Jasmila Žbanić), Slumming (Michael Glawogger), Silentium and Komm, süßer Tod (both Wolfgang Murnberger), The Edukators (Hans Weingartner) and Dog Days (Ulrich Seidl). Other notable contemporary directors are Barbara Albert, Andrea Maria Dusl, Elisabeth Scharang, Jessica Hausner, Stefan Ruzowitzky, Ruth Mader, Kurt Palm, Nikolaus Geyrhalter and, resident in the U.S., Robert Dornhelm.\n\nContemporary Austrian film making is internationally well known for its realistic social dramas, which enjoyed high attention and many awards on international film festivals since the late 1990s. On the occasion of a film row of Austrian films in the Lincoln Center, where films like \"Dog Days\" or Barbara Alberts \"Northern Skirts (Nordrand)\" were shown, \"The New York Times\" came to the point, that Austria is currently the \"world capital of feel-bad cinema\".\n\nThe Holocaust narrative \"Die Fälscher\" (\"The Counterfeiters\") won the Academy Award or \"Oscar\" for Best Foreign Language Film in 2007 while \"Revanche\" was nominated for the same award in 2009. Critical recognition of Austria's new wave film has continued and in 2013 Michael Haneke's French-language film representing Austria, \"Amour\", received both the Oscar and the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nThe Austrian Film Commission (AFC) supports promotion and export of Austrian films. This organisation is the Austrian member of European Film Promotion (EFP), a European-wide network aiming at the worldwide promotion of European film.\n\n\nin English:\n\nin German:\n"}

Eastwood had endorsed Mitt Romney for the 2012 United States presidential election earlier that month, and spent much of his speech's running time on a largely improvised routine in which he addressed an empty chair that represented President Barack Obama. The speech, broadcast in a prime time slot, was viewed live by around 30 million people. It generated many responses and much discussion.\n\nEastwood had a political background, as the non-partisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, and serving on various state commissions on parks and the film industry. He also previously endorsed Republican candidate John McCain during the 2008 United States presidential election. On August 3, 2012, Eastwood had formally endorsed former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney for the 2012 presidential election, speaking at a fundraiser for the candidate.\n\nThe three broadcast networks each devoted one hour of coverage to the convention per night, during the prime 10:00 to 11:00 p.m. time slot. In response to criticism that conventions are over-scripted, organizers did not disclose the identity of the first speaker who had been given the high profile speaking slot. On August 30, CNN reported that Eastwood was the \"mystery guest\".\n\nEastwood made an unannounced appearance at the convention, speaking at the top of the final hour. The speech was scheduled to last five minutes. Eastwood spent much of his speech time on a largely improvised routine addressing an empty chair representing President Barack Obama. The speech lasted about 12 minutes, and was characterized by multiple news sources as \"rambling.\" In at least two instances, Eastwood implied the President had uttered profanities directed both at Romney and himself, saying \"What do you want me to tell Romney? I can't tell him to do that, he can't do that to himself.\"\n\nFollowing his conversation with the empty chair, Eastwood turned his focus to the delegates and the audience at home, stating in part \"But I'd just like to say something ... that I think is very important. It is that, you, we, we own this country. ... it's not politicians owning it; politicians are employees of ours ... And whether you're Democrat or whether you're a Republican or whether you're Libertarian or whatever, you're the best. And we should not ever forget that. And when somebody does not do the job, we got to let 'em go.\" The speech ends with a reference to \"Go ahead, make my day\", spoken by Eastwood character \"Dirty Harry\" Callahan from the 1983 film \"Sudden Impact\".\n\nEastwood's speech was viewed live by 30.3 million people, across at least 11 television networks which were broadcasting coverage of the convention. (Those numbers do not count those watching on C-SPAN, whose audience is not measured.)\n\nEastwood's remarks were well-received within the convention hall, but responses were mixed outside the hall. His ex-partner Frances Fisher posted an essay on Facebook criticizing the speech, and suggested his appearance was a publicity stunt to sell tickets for his then-upcoming film \"Trouble with the Curve\".\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert, an Obama supporter, commented, \"Clint, my hero, is coming across as sad and pathetic. He didn't need to do this to himself. It's unworthy of him,\" and later elaborated that while he continues to revere Eastwood as an artist, he opined that Eastwood was \"handed the wrong sheet music\". Bill Maher, a comedian and talk show host who has been highly critical of the Republican Party, praised Eastwood's performance and his decision to go off-script during a heavily scripted affair: \"As a performer, as a stand-up comedian for 30 years who knows how hard it is to get laughs ... he went up there ... without a net, on a tightrope. There was no teleprompter. He did a bit with just an empty chair and \"killed\".\" Mark Steyn spoke particularly favorably of Eastwood's closing statement, referring to it as \"some of the hardest lines of the convention\". Jon Stewart commented on the August 31 episode of \"The Daily Show\" that Eastwood's performance could be understood as a metaphor for the existence of \"a President Obama that only Republicans can see\", who bears \"so little resemblance to the world and the President that I experience.\"\n\nRepublican Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker described the speech as \"that one moment, which I cringed about\". Former Romney adviser Mike Murphy tweeted: \"Note to file: Actors need a script.\" Meanwhile, Ann Romney commented to \"CBS This Morning\" that Eastwood is \"a unique guy and he did a unique thing last night. We appreciated Clint's support. I didn't know it was coming.\" \"The New York Times\" quoted unnamed Romney aides describing the Eastwood speech as \"strange\" and \"weird.\" One Romney aide described it as \"theater of the absurd.\" According to \"Double Down\", a book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann recounting the 2012 Republican campaign, one of Romney's senior strategists, Stuart Stevens, excused himself during Eastwood's performance to vomit in another room in reaction to it. According to the \"Times\", the Eastwood appearance was cleared by Stevens and another senior campaign leader, Russell Schriefer, who drew up a rough set of talking points for Eastwood. Staffers reported that unlike other speakers at the convention, there were no rehearsals for Eastwood's speech, nor did they require Eastwood to be on script.\n\nStaffers also reported that Eastwood's use of the chair was a last-minute decision by the actor himself. Eastwood confirmed this in a September 4 interview with \"The Carmel Pine Cone\": \"There was a stool there, and some fella kept asking me if I wanted to sit down. When I saw the stool sitting there, it gave me the idea.\" Eastwood further elaborated that he purposely avoided preparing for the speech to make it appear unpolished and more appealing to the average citizen.\n\nDuring his speech, Eastwood said, \"See, I never thought it was a good idea for attorneys to be president anyway,\" apparently referencing President Obama. Amy Argetsinger of the \"Washington Post\" and Joe Palazzolo of \"The Wall Street Journal\" both noted that Romney has a Juris Doctor; as Palazzolo wrote, Romney \"is a trained lawyer and a businessman. He earned both his J.D. and his MBA at Harvard University, in a dual-degree program.\" Romney passed the Michigan bar exam, but has never practiced as an attorney, instead pursuing a career in management consulting.\n\nThe incident led to the \"Eastwooding\" Internet meme spreading via Twitter whereby people would pose next to empty chairs, sometimes pointing at the chairs. The episode was also lampooned in \"The Onion\". The model of chair, designed in 1992 by the Italian architect/designer Sergio Mian, was profiled as well. Inspired by the Eastwood speech, a Texas man hanged an empty chair in effigy.\n\nThe speech follows a long-standing American tradition of empty chair debating, dating back to at least 1924, as pioneered by Progressive vice presidential nominee Burton K. Wheeler. The style of the conversation was noticeably similar to the humorous one-sided conversations popularized by Bob Newhart in the 1960s; Newhart himself joked in a tweet: \"I heard that Clint Eastwood was channeling me at the RNC. My lawyers and I are drafting our lawsuit.\" Bloggers have suggested that Eastwood was attempting a form of Gestalt therapy either for himself or for the Republican Party generally.\n\nIn a September 7, 2012, interview with his hometown newspaper, \"The Carmel Pine Cone\", following his speech at the Republican Nation Convention, Eastwood said that \"President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people,\" and \"Romney and Ryan would do a much better job running the country, and that's what everybody needs to know. I may have irritated a lot of the lefties, but I was aiming for people in the middle.\"\n\nFollowing Obama's poor performance in the first general presidential debate of the 2012 cycle, Eastwood's empty chair symbol was revived. \"The New Yorker\" featured a caricature of Romney debating Eastwood's chair (drawn by Barry Blitt) for its October 15, 2012, edition.\n\nIn response to Clint Eastwood's speech, President Obama tweeted a photo himself sitting in the presidential chair at the Cabinet's Table with the caption \"This seat's taken.\"\n\nOn November 7, 2012, the day after President Barack Obama won reelection, Daniel Day-Lewis brought a chair onstage at the 2012 BAFTA Britannia Awards and congratulated it. Day-Lewis added: \"I love Clint Eastwood, this is no satirical comment on him or his politics...When I saw him talking to a chair in front of a roomful of strangers, I thought: 'I've got to try that.\n\nSeveral months later, following the election, Eastwood revealed to CNBC anchor Becky Quick that his infamous \"empty chair\" skit had been inspired by a Neil Diamond song (\"I Am... I Said\") that had come over the radio in his Tampa hotel room and that included a lyric about an empty chair not hearing the singer's laments. Eastwood said that the skit was made up on the spot right before he gave it and that if he could, he would say something different if he could have a do-over: \"My only message was [that] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked.\" I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's the way to do it in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values.\"\n\nThe chair prop itself was transported from Florida to the offices of Reince Priebus, the former Chairman of the Republican National Committee. While the chair is among many pieces of political memorabilia in Priebus' office, it is the first item he points out to reporters.\n"}

{"id": "24219325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24219325", "title": "Commerce (card game)", "text": "Commerce (card game)\n\nCommerce is a 19th-century gambling French card game akin to Thirty-one and perhaps ancestral to Whisky Poker and Bastard Brag. It aggregates a variety of games with the same game mechanics. Trade and Barter, the English equivalent, has the same combinations, but a different way of acquiring them. Trentuno, \"Trent-et-Uno\", applies basically to the same method of play, but also has slightly different combinations.\n\nLike any other game of the Commerce group, the aim is to finish with the best three-card combination in hand. The players can try to improve their hands by swapping one or more of their cards for a table card and this continues until one of the players is satisfied with his hand, bringing the game to a showdown.\n\nCommerce is usually played by 3-10 players, although any number can play. The game is played with a complete pack of 52 cards ranking A K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. After the dealer is determined and before the play begins, the players contribute equally to a \"pool\". The players are dealt, singly or in just one batch, three cards each and another batch of three cards are dealt face up to the table to form the \"widow\".\n\nBefore looking at his own cards, the dealer may exchange one or two of his cards for one or two of the exposed cards on the table, putting his own, face upwards, in their place. His object is to \"make his hand\", but if he exchanges all three cards at once he cannot do it again. Thereafter, each in turn, starting with the eldest, can do likewise.\n\nUsually there are as many rounds in the game as there are players, and a fresh card is added to the \"widow\" at the beginning of each. A player who is satisfied with his cards then knocks on the table instead of playing, and play ceases as soon as two players have knocked. When the rounds are finished the players show their cards and the holder of the best combination receives the stake deposited in the \"pool\", while the player with the worst hand puts one counter called \"Going up\" therein. The player whose three are first gone off may purchase one more, called \"Buying a horse\", for a sum usually one third of the original stake, or as agreed, to be put into the pool. After that, every player, whose counters are gone must wait until the game comes to an end, which is concluded by the player who continues longer in the game, thereby gaining the final sweep.\n\nThe best combinations are, from high to low:\n\n\nIn case of a tie between two or more of the players in any round, the highest Tricon wins, coming Aces first, then Kings, Queens, down to Twos. If the tie happens to be in a sequence, the highest wins, reckoning the A K Q sequence as the best and the 3 2 A sequence as the lowest. If with Flushes, the one making the best \"point\" wins. If Pairs, the highest wins and if two hands are alike, then the holder of the highest third card has the preference. With Point a tie is very rare, but if that does happen, the holder of the first highest card different from the opponent's wins.\n\nThere are several variations of the game and Pounce, or \"Pounce Coommerce\", seems to be the most popular variation of Commerce. In this, if a player has already three similar cards, e.g. three Nines, and the fourth Nine comes into the pool, he says \"Pounce\" and takes it, thus obtaining a hand of four, which is higher than any hand of three: whenever a pounce occurs, a new card is turned up from the pack.\n\nThe game is played the same way as in the original Commerce, only that there is no \"widow\". The aim is to have the best Commerce hand, that is, a tricon, sequence or point. Starting with the eldest, each in turn must exchange one card by announcing \"trade\" or \"barter\". If the player says \"trade\", he passes a card face down to the dealer and receives another from the stock, paying the dealer one chip for this privilege. If he says \"barter\", he exchanges one card sight unseen with his right-hand neighbour, but without payment. The play continues until one of the players knocks.\n\nIf two players show a hand with the same point value, a three-card beats a two-card flush and if still equal, the winning hand is that of the dealer if he is still involved in the play, otherwise that of the first in order of play after the dealer.\n\nIn this variation a 40-card deck is used. The best hand when someone knocks is that of the player containing cards of the same suit totaling 31 points or the nearest below it. Three of a kind is a special hand ranking between 30 and 31 points.\n\nThis is only applicable to the modern mode of playing the game, which is extended until all the players are satisfied with their hands. They may keep on trading until they all receive cards good enough to stand upon. The great objection to this variation of the game is that it is wearisome because the players have to wait until all the others are satisfied with their cards.\n\nThe combinations \"pair\" and \"point\" are not recognized.\n\n"}

Though most figures were hollowcast metal, composition and plastic dimestore figures were also made. The popularity of the toy soldier reflected public interest in wars around the world and America's own military preparedness of the era.\n\nAs opposed to the standard 54mm size popularised by Britains figures, the minimally painted dimestore figures were 3 inches/7 cm in size to correspond with the American made standard gauge toy trains of the time. Though they had made smaller sized figures previously, Barclay began their 3 inch size in 1924 with the figures made of 87% lead and 13% antimony.\n\nThe largest manufacture of toy soldier in the United States in the 1930s and early 1940s was the Barclay Manufacturing Company. Prices of the soldiers were mostly kept to five cents, a nickel during this time, making them affordable to children. Other manufacturers made similar figures in mostly comparable sizes. The soldier's uniforms changed with military fashion, going from high collar to open collar and from puttees to leggings.\n\nIn 1942 lead toy production ceased with American toy soldiers being manufactured in composition, plastic and paper. Production resumed in 1945 with moulds reconfigured to the M1 Helmet but prices rose to 10 and later 15 cents. In the early 1950s Barclay conserved metal by designing new figures with a large \"pod foot\" instead of the usual base. However the low cost of mass amounts of unpainted plastic figures, the increasing cost of the price of metal and scares of the dangers of metal toys lead to the demise of the dimestore soldier.\n\nBarclay's biggest rival the Manoil Manufacturing Co. ceased trading in 1959. Barclay ceased trading in 1971.\n\n"}

{"id": "10743994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10743994", "title": "Foley (filmmaking)", "text": "Foley (filmmaking)\n\nFoley (named after sound-effects artist Jack Foley) is the reproduction of everyday sound effects that are added to film, video, and other media in post-production to enhance audio quality. These reproduced sounds can be anything from the swishing of clothing and footsteps to squeaky doors and breaking glass. The best Foley art is so well integrated into a film that it goes unnoticed by the audience. It helps to create a sense of reality within a scene. Without these crucial background noises, movies feel unnaturally quiet and uncomfortable.\n\nFoley artists recreate the realistic ambient sounds that the film portrays. The props and sets of a film often do not react the same way acoustically as their real life counterparts. Foley sounds are used to enhance the auditory experience of the movie. Foley can also be used to cover up unwanted sounds captured on the set of a movie during filming, such as overflying airplanes or passing traffic.\n\nThe term \"Foley\" also means a place, such as Foley-stage or Foley-studio, where the Foley process takes place.\n\nWhat is now called Foley originated as sound effects added to live broadcasts of radio drama from radio studios around the world in the early 1920s. Phonograph recordings of the era were not of sufficient quality or flexibility to faithfully reproduce most sound effects on cue, so a sound effects person had to create all sounds for radio plays live. Jack Donovan Foley started working with Universal Studios in 1914 during the silent movie era. When Warner studios released \"The Jazz Singer\", its first film to include sound, Universal knew it needed to stay competitive and called for any employees who had radio experience to come forward. Foley became part of the sound crew that turned Universal's then-upcoming \"silent\" musical \"Show Boat\" into a musical. Because microphones of the time could not pick up more than dialogue, other sounds had to be added in after the film was shot. Foley and his small crew projected the film on a screen while recording a single track of audio that captured their live sound effects. Their timing had to be perfect, so that footsteps and closing doors synchronized with the actors' motions in the film. Jack Foley created sounds for films until his death in 1967. His basic methods are still used today.\n\nModern Foley art has progressed as recording technology has progressed. Today, sounds do not have to be recorded live on a single track of audio. They can be captured separately on individual tracks and carefully synchronized with their visual counterpart. Foley studios employ hundreds of props and digital effects to recreate the ambient sounds of their films.\n\nFoley complements or replaces sound recorded on set at the time of the filming, known as field recording. The soundscape of most films uses a combination of both. A Foley artist is the person who creates this sound art. Foley artists use creativity to make viewers believe that the sound effects are actually real. The viewers should not be able to realize that the sound was not actually part of the filming process itself. Foley sounds are added to the film in post production after the film has been shot. The need for replacing or enhancing sounds in a film production arises from the fact that, very often, the original sounds captured during shooting are obstructed by noise or are not convincing enough to underscore the visual effect or action. For example, fist-fighting scenes in an action movie are usually staged by the stunt actors and therefore do not have the actual sounds of blows landing. Crashes and explosions are often added or enhanced at the post-production stage. The desired effect is to add back to the original soundtrack the sounds that were excluded during recording. By excluding these sounds during field recording, and then adding them back into the soundtrack during post-production, the editors have complete control over how each noise sounds, its quality, and the relative volume. Foley effects add depth and realism to the audio quality for multimedia sources.\n\nFoley artists review the film as it runs to figure out what sounds they need to achieve the desired sound and results. Once they gather the material and prepare for use, they practice the sounds. When they accomplish the desired sound, they watch the film and add in the sound effects at the same time. This is similar to the way actors re-record dialogue, lip-syncing to the video or film image.\n\nScenes where dialogue is replaced using dubbing also feature Foley sounds. Automatic dialogue replacement (ADR) is the process in which voice sounds are recorded in post production. This is done by a machine that runs the voice sounds with the film forward and backward to get the sound to run with the film. The objective of the ADR technique is to add sound effects into the film after filming, so the voice sounds are synchronized. Many sounds are not added at the time of filming, and microphones might not capture a sound the way the audience expects to hear it. The need for Foley rose dramatically when studios began to distribute films internationally, dubbed in other languages. As dialogue is replaced, all sound effects recorded at the time of the dialogue are lost as well.\n\nFoley is created by the sound artist mimicking the actual sound source in a recording studio. Often there are many little sound effects that happen within any given scene of a movie. The process of recording them all can be time-consuming.\n\nFoley art can be broken down into three main categories — feet, moves, and specifics.\n\nThe category entails the sound of footsteps. To make the sound of walking down a staircase, Foley artists stomp their feet on a marble slab while watching the footage. Foley studios carry many different types of shoes and several different types of floors to create footstep sounds. These floors, known as Foley Pits, vary from marble squares to gravel and rock pits. Creating just the right sound of footsteps can greatly enhance the feel of a scene. Foley Artists are often referred to as \"Foley Walkers\" or \"Steppers\" when working in the \"feet\" subset of Foley.\n\nThe “moves” category makes up many of the more subtle sounds heard in films, for example, the swishing of clothing when two actors walk past each other. This sound is created by rubbing two pieces of the same material together near the microphone at the same rate that the actor’s legs cross. Cloth is not always used and tends to be recorded at the discretion of the dubbing mixer who ultimately controls the final outcome of the audio post-production process.\n\nFoley can also include other sounds, such as doors closing and doorbells ringing; however, these tend to be done more efficiently using stock sound effects, arranged by sound editors.\n\nFoley effects help the viewer judge the size of a space. For example, a large hall has strong reverberation, while a small room may have only slight reverberation. Open outdoor spaces usually have no reverberation at all.\n\n† These effects were parodied in The Firesign Theatre's audio play \"The Further Adventures of Nick Danger\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7408685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7408685", "title": "General game playing", "text": "General game playing\n\nGeneral game playing (GGP) is the design of artificial intelligence programs to be able to play more than one game successfully. For many games like chess, computers are programmed to play these games using a specially designed algorithm, which cannot be transferred to another context. For example, a chess-playing computer program cannot play checkers. A general game playing system, if well designed, would be able to help in other areas, such as in providing intelligence for search and rescue missions.\n\n\"General Game Playing\" is a project of the Stanford Logic Group of Stanford University, California, which aims to create a platform for general game playing. It is the most well-known effort at standardizing GGP AI, and generally seen as the standard for GGP systems. The games are defined by sets of rules represented in the Game Description Language. In order to play the games, players interact with a game hosting server that monitors moves for legality and keeps players informed of state changes.\n\nSince 2005, there have been annual General Game Playing competitions at the AAAI Conference. The competition judges competitor AI's abilities to play a variety of different games, by recording their performance on each individual game. In the first stage of the competition, entrants are judged on their ability to perform legal moves, gain the upper hand, and complete games faster. In the following runoff round, the AIs face off against each other in increasingly complex games. The AI that wins the most games at this stage wins the competition, and until 2013 its creator used to win a $10,000 prize. So far, the following programs were victorious:\n\n\nThere are other general game playing systems, which use their own languages for defining the game rules. In 1992, Barney Pell defined the concept of Meta-Game Playing, and developed the \"MetaGame\" system. This was the first program to automatically generate game rules of chess-like games, and one of the earliest programs to use automated game generation. Pell then developed the system \"Metagamer\". This system was able to play a number of chess-like games, given game rules definition in a special language called Game Description Language, without any human interaction once the games were generated.\n\nIn 1998, the commercial system Zillions of Games was developed by Jeff Mallett and Mark Lefler. The system used a LISP-like language to define the game rules. Zillions of Games derived the evaluation function automatically from the game rules based on piece mobility, board structure and game goals. It also employed usual algorithms as found in computer chess systems: alpha-beta pruning with move ordering, transposition tables, etc. The package was extended in 2007 by the addition of the Axiom plug-in, an alternate metagame engine that incorporates a complete Forth-based programming language.\n\nOther general game playing software include:\n\n\n\nThe General Video Game AI Competition (GVGAI) has been running since 2014. In this competition, two-dimensional video games similar to (and sometimes based on) 80s-era arcade and console games are used instead of the board games used in the GGP competition.\n\nSince GGP AI must be designed to play multiple games, its design cannot rely on algorithms created specifically for certain games. Instead, the AI must be designed using algorithms whose methods can be applied to a wide range of games. The AI must also be an ongoing process, that can adapt to its current state rather than the output of previous states. For this reason, open loop techniques are often most effective.\n\nA popular method for developing GGP AI is the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm. Often used together with the UCT method (\"Upper Confidence Bound applied to Trees\"), variations of MCTS have been proposed to better play certain games, as well as to make it compatible with video game playing. Another variation of tree search algorithms used is the Directed Breadth First Search (DBS), in which a child node to the current state is created for each available action, and visits each child ordered by highest average reward, until either the game ends or runs out of time. In each tree search method, the AI simulates potential actions and ranks each based on the average highest reward of each path, in terms of points earned.\n\nIn order to interact with games, algorithms must operate under the assumption that games all share common characteristics. In the book \"Half-Real: Video Games Between Real Worlds and Fictional Worlds\", Jesper Juul gives the following definition of games: Games are based on rules, they have variable outcomes, different outcomes give different values, player effort influences outcomes, the player is attached to the outcomes, and the game has negotiable consequences. Using these assumptions, game playing AI can be created by quantifying the player input, the game outcomes, and how the various rules apply, and using algorithms to compute the most favorable path.\n\nGeneral video game playing (GVGP) is the design of artificial intelligence programs to be able to play more than one video game successfully. In recent years, some progress has been made, including the development of programs that can learn to play Atari 2600 games as well as a program that can learn to play NES games.\n\nGVGP could potentially be used to create real video game AI automatically, as well as \"to test game environments, including those created automatically using procedural content generation and to find potential loopholes in the gameplay that a human player could exploit\". GVGP has also been used to generate game rules, and estimate a game's quality based on Relative Algorithm Performance Profiles (RAPP), which compare the skill differentiation that a game allows between good AI and bad AI.\n\nSince 2014, the General Video Game Playing Competition (GVGAI) has offered a way for researchers and practitioners to test and compare their best general video game playing algorithms. The competition has an associated software framework including a large number of games written in the Video Game Description Language (VGDL). VGDL can be used to describe a game specifically for procedural generation of levels, using Answer Set Programming (ASP) and an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). GVGP can then be used to test the validity of procedural levels, as well as the difficulty or quality of levels based on how an agent performed.\n\nThe games used in GVGP are, for now, often 2 dimensional arcade games, as they are the simplest and easiest to quantify. To simplify the process of creating an AI that can interpret video games, games for this purpose are written in Video Game Description Language (VGDL), which is a coding language using simple semantics and commands that can easily be parsed.\n\n\n\n"}

He has released six albums as a solo artist.\n\nHrab was born in Belleville, New Jersey and grew up speaking Ukrainian and surrounded by Ukrainian culture. He graduated from Montclair Kimberley Academy in 1989.\n\nHrab performs in several genres of music, but most often in rock and funk. His lyrics are often witty and his songs often reflect his interest in science and skepticism. Hrab lists Frank Zappa and David Byrne as key influences. \"You can shake your ass to it, but it's still really smart and interesting,\" he says. He has described his style of music with one word: Philosophunk! \"I’m a big fan of Frank Zappa, Talking Heads, XTC, the Beatles, and things like that. Those are my influences, but at the same time, I’m a huge fan of Stan Freberg and James Randi and Michael Shermer and those kinda guys. So it’s sort of like philosophy and music… What I do is I coalesce the vapors of the universe.\"\n\nHrab has released six albums since 1997 as an independent musician. One of Hrab's unique approaches as an indie is to customize the packaging of each his albums. One features a tin box, one in a DVD case, etc. \"Each one stands out as a piece of art, giving his fans a genuine reason to buy the physical disc as merchandise, not just a music holder.\" Two of his albums have won ADDY Awards for their packaging.\n\nAside from his solo work, Hrab has been a member of many bands over the course of his career, he listed the entire history in one episode of his podcast. The most notable groups are listed below.\n\nIn 1998 Hrab was the touring drummer for the Eric Mintel Quartet, and recorded one jazz album with them. The highlight of this tour was when the group played \"cool '50s swing\" at the Kennedy Center and the White House Christmas party.\n\nHrab's \"day job\" is playing drums for a Philadelphia-area band called the Philadelphia Funk Authority. The nine-member band was formed in 1999 and plays corporate, private and club gigs in the region around Philadelphia and also tours nationwide. The group has shared the stage with Elton John and other acts.\n\n\nWhen performing his own material with a band, Hrab has called the group the Geologic Orchestra. The band is made up of some members of the Philadelphia Funk Authority as well as other musicians, and has played in a seven-piece configuration among others.\n\nHrab's sixth independent album \"Trebuchet\" was released in June 2010. As a means of promoting the album, he offered the full album to any podcast who wanted to run it, uncut, in their feed. Many podcasts such as Skepticality, American Freethought and We Are Not Delicious took him up on his offer. (See below for background on Hrab's ties to the podcasting community). The album is also available as a conventional CD and digital download.\n\nFrom November 26 – December 5, 2010, Hrab embarked on an entirely fan-organized tour of Australia and New Zealand. The tour began with appearances at The Amazing Meeting Australia, a skeptical and freethinker conference co-sponsored by the Australian Skeptics and the James Randi Educational Foundation. In ten days, Hrab traveled to and played in four Australian states, the Australian Capital Territory and the north and south islands of New Zealand.\n\nThe tour was named \"Styrofoam\" after a malapropism created as an inside joke by Kylie Sturgess.\n\nIn September 2013 Hrab announced the inception of The Blue Turtles, a band formed to cover Sting's first solo album, The Dream of the Blue Turtles. The debut performance was on July 20, 2014 at the Ice House in Bethlehem, PA as a part of the Ice House Tonight concert series.\n\n\nOn January 23, 2015 Hrab performed \"Occasional Songs for the Periodic Table\" as a part of the Ice House Tonight series in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. While Hrab previously performed the album on his podcast, and live in an abbreviated version in Las Vegas, this was the first time the entire concert was performed live. The concert consisted of a song written and performed by Hrab for each of the 118 elements on the Periodic Table.\n\nOn January 24, 2016 Hrab performed a greatest hits concert featuring string Quartet versions of songs from 5 of his albums at the Ice House in Bethlehem PA. During the concert George performed with the Rittenhouse String Quartet. Together they performed arrangements of Hrab’s songs arranged by Veikko Rihu and Slau Halatyn On May 12, 2016 Hrab reprised The Broad Street Score at the Fashion Institute of Technology’s, Katie Murphy Amphitheater as part of the annual NECSS conference. The show made its international debut on August 24, 2016 in Turku, Finland.\n\nAfter being featured on the podcast Skepticality Hrab was invited by its hosts to DragonCon in 2006. There he performed and met many podcasters who became interested in featuring his music. He credits this exposure for worldwide interest in his music. \"Folks from Australia and Singapore who should have no idea who I am have downloaded songs and bought albums. That is purely due to podcasts,\" Hrab said.\nAround the same time (summer of 2006), Hrab hosted a weekly program called \"The Geologic Radio Hour\" on the Lehigh University radio station WLVR. Listed as \"free form eclectic\" and running at midnight on Tuesdays, it featured spoken word segments and a number of comedy sketches developed by Hrab. (a segment of one of the programs is available on Hrab's website)\n\nBased on the experience of the radio program and the contacts made in podcasting in 2006, and encouraged by his friend and producer Slau, Hrab launched his own podcast in February 2007.\n\nThe \"Geologic Podcast\" is a weekly podcast consisting of personal stories, comedy sketches, news commentary, music and interviews, starring Hrab. The content often draws from Hrab's musical career, the music industry in general and from topics that relate to skepticism, atheism, rationalism and humanism. The title is a pun on Hrab's first name and his interest in rationalism; the podcast contains \"not a hint of geology\". New episodes of the program are posted on Thursday or Friday.\n\nThe podcast content varies from week to week, but often includes several of a number of recurring segments. Some are Hrab speaking on a particular topic or relating a story, others are comedy sketches in which Hrab plays characters. Occasionally the podcast will take the form of a concert, with Hrab singing and playing guitar. In one such example, Hrab celebrated his 44th birthday by covering Yes' album \"90125\" in its entirety. Hrab has also conducted interviews with musicians such as Slau and Milton Mermikides, as well as others.\n\nIn February 2017 Hrab celebrated 10 years of the podcast with an eight-hour 500th episode which was broadcast as video on Facebook Live. The broadcast featured interviews with Steven Novella, Phil Plait and Paul Provenza, among others.\n\n\nOther than Hrab's mother and the interviews, nearly all the voices on the program are provided by Hrab.\n\nHrab has performed on or has been interviewed by a number of other podcasts, including \"The Good Atheist\", \"Skepticality\", \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\", \"Slacker Astronomy\", \"Sessions with Slau\", \"The Rabbit Zone\", \"The Nonsense Podcast\", \"The Skeptic Zone\", \"Point of Inquiry\", \"Inquiry FM\", \"Artist Connection Podcast\", \"The Pseudo Scientists\", \"Maynard's Malaise\", Cognitive Dissonance, The Story Collider, and InKredulous.\n\nHrab also wrote & recorded the theme song for the 365 Days of Astronomy podcast, \"FAR\". He created and performed in the associated music video.\n\nHrab's TEDx Talk at TEDxLehighRiver September 19, 2015 was titled \"Rethinking Doubt\": The Value and Achievements of Skepticism.\"\n\nOn June 4, 2016, Hrab served as emcee of the Reason Rally in Washington, DC. On June 5, 2016, Hrab moderated a celebrity panel with Kelly Carlin, John de Lancie, Lawrence Krauss, Paul Provenza, and Dave Rubin at the mini-conference that followed the Reason Rally.\n\n\nAfter the release of \"[sic]\", Hrab's self-published first album, he was sued for invasion of privacy by a former supervisor from his job at Moravian College. She claimed that a short phrase written in Cyrillic script in the liner notes as well as one short track on the album were intended as a disparaging remark directed at her, which embarrassed her in front of her coworkers. Hrab denied the charges and the case went to trial in January 1999. Hrab lost the case and had to pay a small amount of damages, and the album was removed from distribution.\n\nLater, Hrab documented the entire affair (including re-enacting all of the testimony at trial) on his podcast. In 2007 the album was re-released with the offending material removed.\n\nHrab is of Ukrainian Catholic descent and was born in New Jersey. His father (also named George Hrab) is a musician who has performed in a band called Tempo since 1959. Hrab has lived in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania since attending Moravian College where he received a Bachelor of Music in 1993. In the summer of 2011, Hrab revealed on his podcast that he is allergic to penicillin.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The game features two modes: a standard game with unlimited credits and a Score Attack mode where players are only given a single credit to beat the game. Score Attack also supports online leaderboards. The game features five different types of ships to choose from, and five stages in total, with each (except the first stage) having its own original boss at the end.\n\nThis game takes place in the Gradian Year 6664, two years before \"The Silent Nightmare Incident\". The planet Antichthon, a protectorate of the Gradian Empire, suddenly and mysteriously falls silent. A report was made by the Director General of the Space Science Agency, Dr. Venom, which mentions that Antichthon's mother computer was now under the control of the Bacterians.\n\nRealizing that a threat from the Bacterians may be imminent, the Gradian Government deploys its Gradian forces to combat the threat. Among them is Special Colonel James Burton, who had defeated the Bacterians a few years ago. Armed with an A.I. program called Gaudie, James Burton sets out in the hyperspace fighter known as the Vic Viper, in the hopes that he can combat the new Bacterian threat. But little does James know that there's much more in store for him...\n\n\"Gradius ReBirth\" uses the \"Nemesis\" titles for the MSX as its basis. The power meter and text display have also been updated. The music was composed by Manabu Namiki and consists of remixed music from previous \"Gradius\" games.\n\nAn update to the game was released on the Wii Shop Channel for free of charge. It improves some of the visuals and adds a new ranking board for the adjustments made to the score system. In addition to this, there are new music tracks and a few changes to the game's levels.\n\n\"Gradius ReBirth\" garnered positive reviews. IGN gave the game 7/10, praising the nostalgic retro design but finding the game to be punishingly hard for most players and the lack of multiplayer disappointing. Despite also praising the retro visuals and soundtrack, NintendoLife gave \"Gradius ReBirth\" 6/10.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44635146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44635146", "title": "HappyHolograms", "text": "HappyHolograms\n\n\"#HappyHolograms\" is the tenth and final episode in the eighteenth season of the American animated television series \"South Park\". The 257th episode overall, it was written and directed by series co-creator and co-star Trey Parker. The episode premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on December 10 2014. It is the second part of the two-part season finale which began with the previous episode, \"#REHASH\". The episode makes multiple references to earlier episodes over the season, as well as to previous seasons, while mainly lampooning the trend of culture constantly making trending topics with no actual relevance. It also lampoons news events such as the death of Eric Garner, the shooting of Michael Brown, the sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby, and the use of celebrity holograms. YouTube celebrity PewDiePie appeared as himself, continuing his story line from the previous episode.\n\nContinuing from the previous episode, \"Rehash\", Kyle Broflovski laments how his younger brother Ike's generation's preoccupation with trending topics and Let's Play videos has led him to be seen as an out-of-touch \"grandpa\" by younger kids. Kyle sends out a Twitter message to help families come together. In response, Bill Cosby appears at Kyle's home to invite him to participate in a television special to be watched by families together. Kyle agrees, but after Cosby leaves, he is revealed to be a hologram.\n\nRandy and Sharon Marsh go to the police to report about the hologram of Randy created by his ex-manager to replace his stage persona Lorde, but the police are skeptical. Meanwhile, a patrolman brings in the rogue Michael Jackson hologram, but despite the fact that the patrolman says he shot the hologram and used a chokehold on him, the hologram's light skin and features present a problem for the police, as they can only use such harsh tactics on black people.\n\nThe television special will feature various celebrities, holograms of deceased celebrities, and LP commentary by Cartman. The special is the brainchild of Randy's ex-producer and Cartman. The producer's staff, however, feel he has given too much power to Cartman, whose growing popularity results in his commentary window appearing not only on computers and other devices, but in thin air throughout the episode. Upon seeing a TV commercial for the special, Kyle is angered that his idea has been turned into a social media project, while his best friend, Stan Marsh, is upset because he thinks his father, Randy, is performing again as Lorde.\n\nRandy and the Jackson hologram learn about the television special and its intent, and agree to work together to stop it. When the Tupac Shakur hologram sent to capture the Jackson hologram appears at the police station, Randy and the Jackson hologram flee to the Marsh home. Randy then learns that Stan and Kyle have been taken hostage by his ex-producer, and is confronted by the Shakur hologram in his home.\n\nWhen Kyle asks the producer why he is doing this, the producer explains that when he became a grandfather, one day he asked his grandson who his favorite celebrity was, and his grandson said it was PewDiePie. Bewildered that his grandson worshiped an insignificant Internet personality, and was unimpressed with anyone to whom he tried to introduce him, the producer says that with the television special, he will assimilate the younger generation's culture into his own. Stan is astonished that the producer is \"such a grandpa\".\n\nThe Shakur hologram and the Jackson hologram decide to team up against the producer. When Cartman's window appears before the producer, he tries to have him shut down, but Cartman is trending so much and has grown so powerful that he has reached \"trend-scendence\", \"like Johnny Depp, but cool\". As Cartman continues to appear on screens all around the world, he states that he is now \"trends-gender\" and therefore must be given his own bathroom, which was his motivation for being involved in this plan. The Shakur and Jackson holograms appear at the restaurant where the producer is hiding with the hostages. As Jackson fatally shoots the producer, Kyle, realizing that everyone on the planet can see everyone else on their computers, speaks out to his brother, Ike, apologizing for being a \"grandpa\". He accepts that Ike will develop his own generational interests, and admits that he was merely sore that Ike was a fan of Cartman in particular. He says that he just wants to be a family again. Ike and his friends resolve to get the public to \"believe\" again, and create a new trend which Kyle, breaking the fourth wall, urges the home audience to spread. In response, PewDiePie's window appears, and his commentary is so powerful that Cartman's window is eliminated.\n\nIn an epilogue, Kyle says he managed to get their family to use the living room again for one hour each night, though Stan is still confused over the events that have just concluded. Kyle suggests that perhaps they are not going to understand it, and further says that at least YouTube celebrities are authentic, and have not been marketed to the public by corporations. PewDiePie's window then appears, and he thanks \"South Park\" for being on \"his\" show.\n\nThe episode contains numerous references to previous episodes in the series, mostly in connection to Randy Marsh's double life as Lorde. Customer service employee \"Steve\" returns from \"Grounded Vindaloop\", as does the Washington Redskins logo from \"Go Fund Yourself\", while Cartman's desire for his own bathroom is from \"The Cissy\".\n\nOn the DVD audio commentary, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, in hindsight, thought the story would have been better off split up into three episodes and not two, mainly because there was a lot of content left that they wanted to use but not enough time. The original plan was to make the story three episodes long but they settled for two.\n\nThe episode makes numerous references to the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, as well as the sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby.\n\nThe episode received a B rating from \"The A.V. Club\"s Dan Caffrey, though he stated that \"It was rushed, it was messy, and it may have been just a bit too much story for \"South Park\", even for a two-parter.\"\n\nMax Nicholson of IGN gave it a 6.8 out of 10, and stated \"the climax of the entire episode (and arguably the season)...didn't tie everything together in the way that it could (and should) have.\"\n\nChris Longo from Den of Geek gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars, stating the episode \"was incoherent, hilarious madness—its own artform.\" Longo's article also noted that, in real life, the topic #IHateCartmanBrah became the top trending topic worldwide on Twitter.\n\n"}
{"id": "231704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231704", "title": "Hard disk recorder", "text": "Hard disk recorder\n\nA hard disk recorder (HDR) is a system that uses a high-capacity hard disk to record digital audio or digital video. Hard disk recording systems represent an alternative to reel-to-reel audio tape recording and video tape recorders, and provide editing capabilities unavailable to tape recorders. Audio HDR systems, which can be standalone or computer-based, typically include provisions for digital mixing and processing of the audio signal.\n\nDirect-to-disk recording (DDR) refers to methods which may also use optical disc recording technologies such as DVD, and Compact disc.\n\nPrior to the 1980s, most recording studios used analog multitrack recorders, typically based on reel-to-reel tape. The first commercial hard disk recording system was the Sample-to-Disk 16-bit, 50 kHz digital recording option for the New England Digital Synclavier II in 1982. The high cost and limited capacity of these solutions limited their use to large professional audio recording studios, and even then, they were usually reserved for specific applications such as film post-production. Stereo audio was not immediately available due to data input and output limitations on hard drives of that time.\n\nWith the arrival of the compact disc in 1982, digital recording became a major area of development by equipment makers. Several affordable solutions were released during the late 1980s and early 90s; many of these continued to use tape, either in reels, or in more manageable videocassettes. In 1993, iZ Technology Corporation developed RADAR (Random Access Digital Audio Recorder distributed by Otari), designed to replace 24-track tape machines. By the mid-1990s, with the steady decline of hard disk prices and the corresponding increases in capacity and portability, the cost of hard disk recording systems had dropped to the point where they became affordable for even smaller studios. Hard disk systems have since become the preferred method for studio recording.\n\nOn January 14, 2004, Engineers from Fairlight, WaveFrame and AMS were awarded Academy Scientific and Technical Awards for the development of hard disk recording technology\n\nOne major advantage of recording audio to a hard disk is that it allows for non-linear editing. Audio data can be accessed randomly and therefore can be edited non-destructively, that is, the original material is not changed in any way. Non-linear editing is not inherent to every hard-disk recording system, however. Different manufacturers implement different degrees of this facility.\n\nHard disk recorders are often combined with a digital mixing console and are an integral part of a digital audio workstation (DAW). In this form, complex tasks can be automated, freeing the audio engineer from performing a final mix in real time.\n\nA personal computer can be used as a hard disk recorder with appropriate software; nowadays this solution is often preferred, as it provides a more flexible interface to the studio engineer. Many studio-grade systems provide external hardware, particularly for the analog to digital conversion stages, while less expensive software systems can use the sound card included with any modern computer.\n\nThe major constraints on any hard disk recording system are the storage capacity, transfer rate, and processor speed. Some systems use lossy audio compression to minimize the first two factors. This solution is becoming increasingly rare, thanks to rapid increases in hard disk capacity.\n\nStand-alone hard disk recorders are able to record audio or video without requiring a computer. Examples of notable stand-alone hard disk recorders and manufacturers include Alesis, Akai, Fostex, Korg, Mackie, TASCAM, Roland Corporation, Yamaha Pro Audio, RADAR and Zoom HD8 and HD16.\n\nMiniaturization of recording and storage technology for consumer video already allows the non-professional user to directly record home movies to a permanent storage medium like DVD.\n\nDDRs have replaced Magnetic tape based DV, Digital8, 8mm Video Format, VHS and MicroMV video tape recorders.\n\nProfessional television studio DDRs video servers are being used to replace video tape recorders (VTR)s and VTR Cart machines, that playout television commercials and TV shows. Digital audio workstations (DAW) are used in professional audio recording studios. Computer software can implement a hard disk recorder function.\n\nConsumer applications include camcorders to high-end tapeless camcorders, digital video recorder (DVR) and set top box models like TiVo and personal computer based recorders. More professional applications include non-linear editing (NLE) systems like Avid Technology video editing systems, recording television productions/filmmaking in the field with professional video cameras in digital cinematography for digital cinema productions. Hard disk recorders are used in professional television studio from small systems able to record 2 hours to large multi port playout systems supporting hundreds of hours of material.\n\n"}
{"id": "40857095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40857095", "title": "Hypsos", "text": "Hypsos\n\nHypsos is a Greek philosophical concept comparable to the modern concept of the sublime, or a moment that brings oral speech to an astonishing and monumental pause. Its root \"hypso-\" literally means \"aloft\", \"height\", or \"on high\". However, a distinguishing feature of hypsos in rhetorical studies is that it “combines conflicting emotions: fear and awe, horror and fascinations.” It is a climactic moment in speech that generates uncertainty for the audience.\n\nThe ancient Greek rhetoric teacher Longinus introduced the concept of hypsos in the only significant piece of literature that he is known for having written during his lifetime, \"On the Sublime\". In his work, Longinus prompted the possibilities and freedom that speech could possess by presenting hypsos. Longinus’ theories and concepts differed greatly from other Greek rhetoricians and philosophers, and challenged the traditional rigid structure of rhetorical practices.\n\nHypsos is studied by present-day rhetoricians, and is often referred to through the publication of \"Translations of the Sublime: The Early Modern Reception and Dissemination of Longinus: Peri Hupsous in Rhetoric, the Visual Arts, Architecture, and the Theatre\", a collection of volumes of Longinus’ essays. It stands as one of few pieces that explore the ways in which hypsos (which Longinus refers to as “the sublime in one single thought”) is used not only in rhetoric and literature, but also in the visual arts, architecture, and theater.\n"}
{"id": "57701724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57701724", "title": "Illustrated Tarock", "text": "Illustrated Tarock\n\nIllustrated Tarock () or Illustrated Dreiertarock is a card game for three players from the Austrian branch of the Tarock family. It was thought by Mayr and Sedlaczek to be extinct but, in 2009, when the two Tarock authors were guests on an ORF radio programme, players from Vienna called in who confirmed they still played the game. It is sometimes called Point Tarock which, however, is a different game, albeit a close cousin. Although it has \"a reputation for being a little more convoluted than the others\", Furr, who calls it Point Tarock, maintains that this is not so. However, he recommends that players become familiar with Tapp Tarock before attempting this game.\n\nThere is no consensus over the meaning of the name. The Tarock game described here is occasionally called \"Point Tarock\", or it is given both names. However, Point Tarock is actually a different form of game, which also appears under the name \"Illustriertes Tarock\".\n\nAs in other Tarock games there are no official rules. Instead the rules vary from game to game and publication to publication. The rules given here follow those of Fritz Beck. These instructions also offer occasional variations. In places, other variants from a set of rules used in Graz are mentioned; they are indicated in the test with (G).\n\nLike other Tarock games in Austria and other lands of the former Habsburg Empire, Illustrated Tarock uses a 54-card deck of the type described in the article on Königrufen. This deck contains 22 tarocks as trumps (I – XXI + Sküs) and 32 suit cards in the four French suits of Hearts, Diamonds, Spades and Clubs.\n\nThe game uses the same values as other Austrian tarock games like Königrufen.\n\n5 Points – Kings, I, XXI, Sküs; 4 Points – Queens; 3 Points – Cavaliers; 2 Points – Valets; 1 Point – remaining tarocks and pip cards\n\nCounting is carried out in groups of 3 cards. From the points in each group, 2 are deducted e.g. King + Cavalier + X = 9 points, minus 2 points gives 7 points. If fewer than 3 cards remain, 2/3 points are deducted from the total. 1/3 or 2/3 points are rounded up or down at the end to the nearest whole number.\n\nHigher suit cards beat lower ones of the same suit; tarocks beat suit cards and lower tarocks. Players must follow suit (\"Farbzwang\") but do not have to win the trick (no \"Stichzwang\"). If the lead suit cannot be followed, a tarock card must be played.\n\nAs in most Tarock games, play proceeds anti-clockwise.\n\nA player is nominated as the dealer by lots; in one variant (G), a recorder (\"Schreiber\") is also chosen by lots. Rearhand deals; middlehand sitting to his left cuts or knocks.\n\nSix cards are laid face down to for a talon. The rest of the cards, even if they have been 'knocked', are dealt in four packets of four cards. In one variant (G), if the cards have been knocked, after the talon three packets of 16 cards are dealt. Forehand and middlehand decide which packet to take up, the third is left for rearhand.\n\nDuring the auction (\"Lizitation\"), players look to see if there is a contract that they can bid for.\n\nThe value of the contract depends on the number of talon cards to be used. \"Dreiblatt\" is a contract using 3 of the talon cards, \"Zweiblatt\" uses two, \"Einblatt\" uses one and Solo none.\n\nForehand names a contract or says \"pass\" (\"Weiter\"), whereupon the right to bid passes to middlehand, etc.\n\nA declared game may be confirmed by the next player as follows:\n\nNext, forehand decides, if necessary, whether to accept a declared \"Unteren\" or not (\"hold the contract\" – \"das Spiel halten\"). The contract 'held' could then be outbid by rearhand declaring a higher value contract.\n\nIn this case (three \"passes\") there are three options for reaching an agreement:\n\nAfter the auction and declaration of any bonuses have been made, the talon is uncovered (except in Trishaken and Solo) without changing the order of the cards. In a variant (G), however, bonuses are \"not\" declared before the talon is uncovered. Depending on the outcome of the auction, the player takes three, two or one card into his hand, whereby only adjacent cards may be selected. After evaluating the hand, a corresponding number of cards are dealt face down. These are counted at the end together with the cards in the player's tricks.\n\nThe soloist then declares \"Ich liege\" and makes any bonus declarations. The defenders, in clockwise order, say \"good\" (\"Gut\") or \"Kontra\". When the \"Kontra\" process has finished, forehand leads to the first trick. Subsequently, the player who wins a trick leads to the next trick.\n\nAt the end of the game the card points gained are counted up. To win the contract at least 36 points (rounded up or down as need be) are required.\n\nThis describes how points are awarded for games won and the multiplication factors depending on the number of cards drawn from the talon. See Bonuses for the settlement of bonus declarations and Valat.\n\nThe following game points apply:\n\nTo these game points are added \"excess points\", i.e. the number of points above 35, the number needed to win. For example, a declared contract won with 40 points counts 3 + 5 = 8 points.\n\nTrischaken scores as follows:\n\nThe scoring of contracts and bonuses depends in the number of cards taken from the talon, as follows:\n\nSo a contract of \"Zweiblatt\" won with 39 card points scores (3 + 4) × 2 = 16 game points.\n\nIn the literature slightly different scoring schemes may be found.\n\nA number of bonuses (declarations) may be awarded in Illustrated Tarock. These are bonuses for certain card combinations, bonuses for points earned, bonuses for last trick declarations and bonuses for the Valat. There are several declaration options:\n\nThe respective basic values for \"Still\" contracts are given.\n\nBonuses for card combinations do not depend on the outcome of the game, they are always awarded. Beck assigns the basic value when the declaration has been made after talon cards have been exchanged, at G only the basic value is assigned for a declaration after the game has ended\n\nThese bonuses can be won both by the soloist and by a defender. Here, too, Beck assigns the basic value when the declaration has been madke after talon cards have been exchanged, at G only the basic value is awarded for a declaration after the end of the game.\n\n\nThese bonuses can only be earned by the soloist.\n\n\nFor these bonuses, too, Beck doubles the basic value doubled for declarations made after the talon exchange. G only awards a bonus for \"With 50\", 10 points, awarded at the end of the game.\n\n\nOw Pre-Ultimo (\"Uhu Pre-Ultimo\") is a variation that needs to be pre-agreed.\n\nBeck is silent about any \"Mondfang\" (\"Moon capture\") bonus. The Graz rules state:\n\nIf Tarock XXI is take by the Sküs, the winner of the Mond gets an extra 5 points and the player who lost the Mond has 5 points deducted.\n\nValat is when a player wins all the tricks in a game.\n\nIn this game of three, there is very rarely a distribution of cards that enables Valat to be achieved. The possibility of declaring Valat is even rarer.\n\nValat is scored, according to Beck, as follows:\nVariant A:\n\nValues apply to Dreiblatt; in addition to other in-game points and bonuses.\n\nVariant B:\nThe numbers 12/24/48 above are considered multiplying factors for the points scored in the game and for bonuses. Beck writes: \"However, this method of calculation is controversial [...] and we do not necessarily recommend it either.\" \n\nIn this variant, multiplication factors are used.\n\nMultiplication basis: points for declared/'taken'/'held' contract; surplus points; bonuses for card combinations; bonuses for last trick declarations. The multiplication factors for \"Zweiblatt\" etc. are applied.\n\nIf Valat is not achieved, the game is won by the defenders with the points of the cards that were in play, i.e. 70 minus the remaining cards in the talon.\n\nBoth contract and bonus declarations may be responded to with \"Kontra\" (\"double!\") and the first declarer may reply with \"Rekontra\".\n\nKontras may be declared before or after the talon pick-up, and always double the game points and bonuses. Beck is silent as to whether Kontra is only valid for the defender who says it or whether it is also valid for his partner.\n\nKontras always take place after the player has said \"Ich liege!\". Game and bonus declarations are treated separately (if necessary only one of them). Kontra also applies to a defending partner.\n\nRevoking is a violation of the rules. If the soloist 'revokes', his game and bonus declarations are considered lost, the game is scored with ten surplus points, and they are awarded to the defenders. In the case of revoking by a defender, the game awarded to the soloist, he receives all points for game (including ten excess points) and bonuses credited.\n\nIllustrated Tarock is played in series. A series ends as soon as at least one player reaches 100 game points. Players who earn 100 points will receive 10 extra points. This does not happen if it was the result of a revoking.\n\nFor each player, the total points achieved after each game are recorded. It is quite possible that player A gets points for the game won, player B and C get points for a Pagat Ultimo that player A did not get through.\n\nThe notation is done line by line. Either each player can write down their own series or a player (the \"Schreiber\") is drawn by lot and records the results of all players.\n\n"}

His most recent book, \"The Capitalism Papers\", argues against capitalism as a sustainable and viable system on which to base an economy.\n\nMander was born in the Bronx, New York City to Harry and Eva Mander, \nan immigrant Jewish couple who struggled to achieve success in America. In his \"Four Arguments\" he wrote:\nMy parents carried the immigrants' fears. Security was their primary value: all else was secondary. Both of them had escaped pogroms in Eastern Europe. My father's career had followed the path familiar to so many New York immigrants. Lower East Side. Scant schooling. Street hustling. Hard work at anything to keep life together. Early marriage. Struggling out of poverty.\n\nCuriously, success came to him during the Depression. He founded what later became Harry Mander and Company, a small service business to the garment industry, manufacturing pipings, waist bands, pocketing and collar canvas.\n\nOne of the reasons for my father's success during hard times was World War II. He was beyond draft age and so was free to do a successful trade in servicing the manufacture of military uniforms. After the war, the business grew in new directions as the economy spurted forward into an era of rapid growth.\nAt an early age, Jerry Mander moved with his family from the Bronx to a semi-rural area of Yonkers, New York. \nHe grew up there, and says: \"I was a golf star throughout my youth and that was what I wanted to be, a professional golfer when I was very young.\"\nMander earned a B.S. in Economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, then an M.S. in International Economics from Columbia University’s Business School.\n\nAfter receiving his M.S., Mander worked in advertising for 15 years, including five as partner and president of Freeman, Mander & Gossage in San Francisco. Mander worked with the noted environmentalist, David Brower, managing the Sierra Club's advertising campaigns to prevent the construction of dams in the Grand Canyon, to establish Redwood National Park, and to stop the U.S. Supersonic Transport (SST) project. In 1971 he founded the first non-profit advertising agency in the United States, Public Interest Communications.\n\nMander served as the executive director of the International Forum on Globalization, which he founded in 1994, until 2009 and continues on its staff as a Distinguished Fellow. He is also the program director for Megatechnology and Globalization at the Foundation for Deep Ecology.\n\nIn 2007 Jerry Mander appeared in the full-length documentary film, \"\".\n\nIn an interview with Nancho.net's W. David Kubiak, \nMander describes how he got into advertising and how he turned it to the service of social causes:\nWell, I wasn't a rebel when I got into advertising. I became a rebel through advertising. It was by being in advertising and realizing what advertising does in the system. I mean I can't explain why I, unlike other advertising men, saw that as a big problem. But I became involved using those techniques to help, you know, environmental groups and anti-war groups and civil rights groups, using advertising as a technique to help them. Advertising and also public relations work. So using that medium is what awoke me in many ways to the power of the medium and the power to use it in the reverse, against the system as well. Although the main problem is that those who are in power have so much more power and more money than those who are trying to resist it. And so we're always up against a heavy ratio, and the fact the opposite side has more power than we do.\nIn 1965, Mander married feminist author Anica Vesel Mander (b. 1934, d. 2002-06-19). They had two sons, Kai Maxim Mander and Yari David Mander. Although the Manders divorced in 1982, they remained close friends for the rest of Anica's life.

Marino Faliero, recently elected Doge of Venice, offends one of the chief officers of state, Michel Steno. Steno retaliates by writing on the Doge's throne an indecent libel on Faliero's wife. For this he is tried by the Council of Forty and convicted, but is only sentenced to a month's imprisonment. Faliero is so outraged by this, as he believes, inadequate punishment that he secretly joins in the conspiracy of a group of malcontents to overthrow the constitution of Venice, thinking thereby to gain revenge on his enemies. The plot is discovered and Faliero is executed.\n\nByron was inspired to take on this subject when, on examining the portraits of the Doges in the Palazzo Ducale in Venice, he discovered that the portrait of Faliero had been blacked out. The main historical source he drew on was Marino Sanuto's \"Vite dei Doge\" (published posthumously 1733). He completed the play in July 1820, by which time he was living in Ravenna, and published it in April 1821, along with his \"The Prophecy of Dante\". He intended to dedicate it to Goethe, but delays in the post between Italy and England resulted in the play being published without a dedication. The posthumous 1832 edition of Byron's collected works included a later dedication of the play by Byron to his friend Douglas Kinnaird. \"Marino Faliero\" was translated into French in 1830 and into Italian in 1838.\n\nByron intended his play to be read rather than acted, and when he heard that the actor-manager Robert William Elliston intended to stage it he caused his publisher, John Murray, to obtain an injunction to prevent him. Elliston nevertheless performed it, in a version cut almost by half, at Drury Lane four days after the play was published. The reaction from both audiences and critics was lukewarm; perhaps, as Byron thought, because of the play's neoclassical form and lack of sensationalism and love interest.\n\nThe subject of Eugène Delacroix' painting \"The Execution of the Doge Marino Faliero\" (1825–26), now in the Wallace Collection in London, was suggested by Byron's play. A tragedy by Casimir Delavigne on the same subject is believed to have drawn on Byron, as well as on a story by E. T. A. Hoffmann, and Delavigne's play itself inspired Donizetti's opera \"Marino Faliero\". Swinburne was impelled to write his own \"Marino Faliero\" by what he considered shortcomings in Byron's play.\n\n"}
{"id": "16634028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16634028", "title": "Michael B. Leavitt", "text": "Michael B. Leavitt\n\nMichael B. Leavitt (1843–1935) was an American theater entrepreneur, manager, and producer. He entered show business as a blackface minstrel show singer. By the 1860s, Leavitt had made the leap to management and, following the precedent set by others, was touring variety show troupes in rural areas, billing them as authentic city entertainment. By 1870, Leavitt had made a name in the theater industry by importing acts to North America from Europe. Leavitt's companies toured both the United States and Mexico; he had a corner on the best theaters in the latter. He sometimes worked in partnership with his brother, Abraham Leavitt. Acts he managed include magicians Alexander Herrmann and Harry Kellar.\n\nIn his memoirs, Leavitt claimed to have made several innovations in American show business. For example, he credited himself with the introduction of lithographic theater posters to the United States in 1872 after he had brought some back from Europe. By the end of the 1870s, lithographic printing had begun to supplant block printing for theater advertising. Leavitt claimed that in the late 1870s, his six to eight touring burlesque companies required $8,000 to $20,000 worth of lithographs posters each season. Another of Leavitt's claims was that he was the first to use \"all star\" as a billing description. He also claimed that in 1880, he was the first to use the term \"vaudeville\" to describe a variety show.\n\nHistorians usually cite Leavitt's greatest innovation as the creation of the first touring burlesque company and of the burlesque style in general. Leavitt had witnessed a European troupe known as Rentz's Circus sometime in the 1870s. He then decided to form an all-woman blackface minstrel troupe, which he named Madame Rentz's Female Minstrels. The format of its shows, which Leavitt introduced, merged the three-act blackface minstrel show with aspects of Lydia Thompson's all-female troupe's show, vaudeville, and musical travesty. He called the new genre \"burlesque\". The troupe, later renamed the Rentz-Stantley Company and then the Rentz-Stantley Novelty and Burlesque Company, was a success, and it set the standard for burlesque companies through the 1880s and 1890s.\n\nLeavitt had a taste for sensationalism. For example, in 1884, he bought the rights to \"The Danites\", a play by McKee Rankin that was quite critical of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). Leavitt then decided to stage the play in Salt Lake City, historical center of Mormonism, as a publicity stunt.\n\nLeavitt also handled magicians Alexander Herrmann and Harry Kellar. \"Whenever I open a new theatre, \" Leavitt once said, \"I want to insure of large crowds, I will have Herrmann the Great play the date.\" Herrmann was always a drawing card where ever he played, receiving fifty percent of the gross receipt earning $75,000 a year (about $3 million in today's figures).\n\nAged 70 in 1914, Leavitt came out of retirement to enter the motion picture business. He secured the rights to present the film \"Sixty Years a Queen\" in the Canadian Maritimes. Despite his advanced age, show business chronicler Robert Grau described Leavitt as \"yet as spry and apparently as youthful as he was in his palmy days\".\n\n"}

The game was developed by Funcom and released in Europe in September 15, 1999 and in North America on March 31, 2000.\n\nSpeed Freaks is a kart racing game featuring several single and multiplayer modes. During the game, players take control of one of nine characters and drive karts around tracks with various themes. During a race, the player's viewpoint is from behind his or her kart. The goal of the game is to either finish a race ahead of other racers, who are controlled by the computer and other players, or complete a circuit in the fastest time.\n\nIcons marked with question marks are arrayed on the race tracks; they give weapons (pick-ups) to a player's kart if the vehicle passes over them. Pick-ups, such as missiles and slime, allow racers to hit others with the objects, causing them to spin and lose control. A kart that obtains the stealth mode pick-up is temporarily invulnerable to attack. Lines of speed boost tokens are found on the tracks. By running through these tokens, a kart collects them and fills cells on its speed boost bar. The player can use accumulated speed boost to increase speed at a faster rate than under normal acceleration.\n\n\"Speed Freaks\" has three single player modes, Tournament, Single Race and Time attack. In Tournament one player races against five computer-controlled characters in a series of four races called leagues. There are three leagues available, titled Easy, Medium and Hard. Initially only the Easy league is available, by finishing this league, the Medium league is unlocked, which in turn unlocks the Hard league when finished. In order to continue through a league a position of third or higher must be achieved in each race. If a player finishes in fourth to sixth position, the race must be retry – at the cost of one of a limited number of retries – until a placing of third or above is achieved. Points are accrued by finishing in the top three positions in a race; first to third place receive ten, seven and five points. Computer controlled characters are also awarded three points for fourth place and one point for fifth place. The racer with the highest number of points after all four races have been completed wins the league. winning all of the races in a league unlocks one of Three Challenges. In each challenge a player races against one computer-controlled character in a single race, where if the player wins the race, their opponent becomes a playable character. In single race mode, players compete against five computer-controlled characters at a track of the players' choosing from those that are present in Tournament mode. In time attack mode, players race against the clock through the same tracks that are present in Tournament mode, attempting to set the fastest time possible.\n\n\"Speed Freaks\" also has two multiplayer modes; Vs. and Multiplayer. In Vs. mode two players race against each other either in a single race or through a league, on the same tracks as are present in the Tournament mode, with the screen split in half. In Multiplayer mode three or four players race against each other, on one of 12 additional tracks. The tracks featured in this mode have lower detail than those in single player and Vs. mode. This game mode requires the Multitap peripheral in order for four controllers to be connected to the PlayStation.\n\n\"Speed Freaks\" features nine original characters from which the player can choose to compete as or against. Six characters are available immediately at the start of the game and three further characters can be unlocked by beating them in a challenge. Each character's kart has different capabilities with differing levels of top speed, acceleration and handling.\n\n\"Speed Freaks\" was produced by Padraig Crowley and designed and developed by the SD Team at Funcom Dublin in Ireland. The game took over two years to develop. Working titles used included \"Project SDR\" and \"Wheelnuts\".\n\nThe game was released in North America under the title \"Speed Punks\". Sony acquired the rights to publish the game in the region as early as the summer of 1999, but held back as to avoid competing with \"Crash Team Racing\".\n\n\"Travelling Without Moving\" by Jamiroquai is used in the introduction video of this videogame. Other music within the game is by Martin Schioler.\n\nThe game received mostly positive reviews. IGN gave it a 9/10.\n"}

Adapted from a French farce, the show featured dialogue that was condemned as indecent by many contemporary reviewers. The play's appearance on Broadway was suppressed when New York City officials threatened not to renew the operating license of the theater.\n\nThe story follows the misbehaviors of Regina (Valeska Suratt) as she passes whooping cough to the numerous men she kisses. In the final act, her amours land her in divorce court, where she performs a dance routine borrowed from Suratt's vaudeville act.\n\nAfter early performances in Trenton, New Jersey, producer Al Woods brought the play to Broadway, with sultry vaudeville actress Valeska Suratt in the lead role. It opened at the New York Theatre on April 25, 1910. Trenton police had attended a rehearsal and declared the play fit for performance after some mild censorship, but when it came to New York, Mayor William Jay Gaynor viewed it less favorably. Hearing rumors about the play's content, he reviewed a script beforehand and found nothing objectionable in it. When the production went live, he received complaints that made him suspect he had not been given an accurate script. He decided to send stenographers to take notes on its content. They reported back that the actors had \"interpolated\" salacious elements into the performance.\n\nBased on this evidence, Gaynor asked New York City Police Commissioner William F. Baker to suppress the play. On May 6, 1910, Baker contacted the theater's management company, Klaw & Erlanger. He threatened that if the play was not stopped, he would refuse to renew the theater's operating license, which expired at the end of April. Abraham L. Erlanger promised to cancel the show, but Woods did not agree. After unsatisfactory meetings with Baker and Gaynor, Woods went to the New York Supreme Court on May 9, 1910, to get an injunction preventing the police from closing down the play. The judge gave Woods the order he requested, but while it prevented the authorities from interfering with the show directly, it did not compel them to renew the license for the theater. Left with no home for his production, Woods was forced to shut it down.\n\nNotwithstanding the objections from Woods, Gaynor's actions garnered a positive response from the press. A column in \"The New York Times\" said his actions were guided by \"common sense and good taste\". When the show headed to other cities, Gaynor threatened to write other mayors to warn them against it.\n\nThe play was \"unmercifully damned by the critics\", according to theater scholar Gerald Bordman. The \"Trenton True American\" described the performances there as \"disgustingly vulgar\". A brief review of the Broadway opening from \"The New York Times\" called it \"stupid\", although the reviewer found some humor in the performance of supporting player Dallas Welford. Drama critic George Jean Nathan called it \"nauseating and ... disgusting in its futile efforts to be risqué\".\n\nWhen the play went on the road after being shut down in New York, the \"Philadelphia Times\" declared it \"coarse\", \"vulgar\" and not worthy of any \"self-respecting person\".\n"}

It is based loosely on Steven Millhauser's short story, \"Eisenheim the Illusionist\". The film tells the story of Eisenheim, a magician in turn-of-the-century Vienna, who reunites with his childhood love, a woman far above his social standing. The film also depicts a fictionalized version of the Mayerling incident.\n\nThe film premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and opened the 2006 Seattle International Film Festival; it was distributed in limited release to theaters on August 18, 2006, and expanded nationwide on September 1. The film was a commercial and critical success.\n\nIn Vienna, Austria-Hungary, 1889, a magician named Eisenheim is arrested by Chief Inspector Walter Uhl of the Vienna Police during a magic show involving necromancy. Later, Uhl explains the story of Eisenheim's life to Crown Prince Leopold.\n\nEisenheim was born to a cabinet-maker and became interested in magic after meeting a travelling magician. He also fell in love with Sophie, the Duchess von Teschen, but the two were forbidden to see each other on account of the former being a peasant. They kept meeting secretly but were caught one day and separated by force. Eisenheim proceeded to study magic by travelling the world, and fifteen years later returned to Vienna to perform. During one performance, he encounters the adult Sophie and learns that she is expected to marry the Crown Prince Leopold, who, it is rumored, is brutal towards women and in the past even murdered one. Eisenheim conducts a private show for the Crown Prince and humiliates him in the course of it. In response, he is banned from performing again in Vienna. Eisenheim asks Sophie to flee with him, but Sophie is afraid that they will be hunted down and executed. Sophie also reveals that the Crown Prince is planning a \"coup d'etat\" against his elderly father, the Emperor Franz Joseph I.\n\nAt the Mayerling hunting lodge, Sophie tries to end her engagement with Leopold. He reacts by chasing her into the stables with a sword, in full view of the servants. Sophie's body is discovered the next morning in the Vienna Woods, an unknown man blamed for her assassination. This throws Eisenheim into a deep depression. He eventually buys a theatre and begins a new series of magic shows, this time focusing exclusively on the summoning of dead spirits. Leopold secretly attends one of them, during which Eisenheim summons the spirit of Sophie, who says that someone in the theater is her murderer. Leopold, highly unnerved, orders Uhl to arrest Eisenheim for fraud, but Eisenheim manages to avoid jail by openly confessing to the public that his show is a mere illusion.\n\nEisenheim is threatened that if he summons Sophie in his next performance, he will be arrested and likely imprisoned. Uhl attends the packed performance with dozens of officers, and in spite of the warnings, Eisenheim brings Sophie's spirit to life again. Uhl storms the stage with his officers, but to the shock and horror of the audience, Eisenheim is revealed to be a spirit when Uhl's hand passes through him. Eisenheim then fades away in front of everyone.\n\nUhl reveals to Leopold that he has found evidence - a jewel from Leopold's sword and Sophie's distinctive locket - which could implicate Leopold in Sophie's murder. Uhl has already informed the Emperor and the General Staff of Leopold's conspiracy to seize the throne. Leopold points a revolver at Uhl, threatening to kill him, but as officers of the imperial guard of the Austro-Hungarian Army arrive, Leopold shoots himself in the head. Later, as Uhl leaves the palace, he places Sophie's locket in his pocket. He is now no longer Chief Inspector of Police. As a boy approaches him, he is jostled by a bearded man in a long coat. The boy gives him a package containing Eisenheim's notebook about the Orange Tree trick, which Uhl had been unable to figure out. He asks the boy who it was that gave him the notebook, and the boy replies \"Herr Eisenheim.\" He checks his pocket and realizes the person who jostled him stole the locket. He sees the man and chases after him, but the man boards a train and escapes. Uhl realizes the jostling and the notebook are a message from the illusionist, and begins to rethink recent events. He concludes that Sophie and Eisenheim staged her death so that she could be free of Leopold. Uhl laughs delightedly at the brilliance of their plan. Later, and far away, Sophie and Eisenheim start a new life together in a cabin at the foot of a beautiful mountain. Eisenheim places Sophie's locket in her palm.\n\n\nThe script was based loosely on \"Eisenheim the Illusionist\", a short story by Steven Millhauser from Millhauser's 1990 collection \"The Barnum Museum\". Together with \"The Prestige\" and \"Scoop\", \"The Illusionist\" was one of three films in 2006 to explore the world of stage magicians.\n\nMagic consultancy and technical advice during the production was supplied by James Freedman, Ricky Jay, Michael Weber and Scott Penrose. Director Neil Burger wrote, \"Starting in pre-production, James (Freedman) became a major collaborator; brainstorming, designing and refining everything from small sleight of hand tricks to major narrative set pieces. He worked with Edward Norton preparing him for his stage performances and acted as a hand double in various scenes. His contribution was enormous.\" Aaron Johnson, who plays the teenage Eduard in the beginning of the film, also learned how to do the ball trick seen in those scenes.\n\nThe original story, on which the movie is based, does not include the artifice of the protagonist framing the Archduke for murder.\n\nAlthough the film is set in Austria, it was filmed mostly in the Czech Republic. The city of Vienna is represented in the film by Tábor and Prague, while the scenes set in Eisenheim's childhood village were shot in Český Krumlov. The Crown Prince's castle is actually the historical fortress of Konopiště (located near Benešov), formerly the home of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. The front gates of Leopold's Vienna palace (the Hofburg) were actually the front gates of Prague Castle. All other shots were at Barrandov Studios in Prague.\n\nAs of June 29, 2008 the film has earned worldwide box office receipts of $87,892,388, including $39,868,642 in the United States, exceeding its reported $16.5 million budget. In the first five months after it was released on DVD in January 2007, the film earned $35.99 million in rental revenue.\n\n\"The Illusionist\" received mostly positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes classified it as 73% \"certified fresh\" with 190 reviews (as of March 4, 2018). Jonathan Rosenbaum's review in \"The Chicago Reader\" praised Paul Giamatti's performance of \"a character who feels sympathy for the magician but owes allegiance to Leopold and is therefore divided and compromised ... Giamatti's performance is subtle, expressive, and richly nuanced.\" Stephen Holden, in his review for \"The New York Times\", praised Edward Norton's role, which, according to him, \"perfectly fits his disturbing inscrutability\". \"Variety\" wrote that Jessica Biel \"is entirely stunning enough to fight to the death over\".\n\nDirector of Photography Dick Pope earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, losing at the 79th Academy Awards to Guillermo Navarro, cinematographer for \"Pan's Labyrinth\".\n\nThe soundtrack for the film was composed by Philip Glass and was released on 15 August 2006.\n\n\nOn October 14, 2014, it was announced that The CW was developing a TV series based on the film.\n\n"}

In contrast to performers, this broad category contains all \"unseen\" theatrical personnel who practice stagecraft and are responsible for the logistic and production-related aspects of a performance including designers, operators, and supervisors. Many professional designers and technicians consider the diminutive \"techie\" to be offensive.\n\nTheatrical responsibilities taken by technicians include:\nA single theatrical technician may regularly do one or more of the above jobs during load in, load outs (strike), rehearsal and performance. Performance technicians are generally divided between those backstage (stagehands, Stage Managers) and those in a control room (lighting and audio technicians). During load in and load out additional crew members may be needed due to the amount of work required to be completed in a short time span. Larger and more complex shows require larger crews and often personnel with specialized advanced skills to perform these job functions.\n\nThe position may be volunteer or a paid position. It is not uncommon to receive compensation (such as comp/free tickets to the current or future productions or items used in the show) in other forms than money for pay. This type of compensation allows the person working to receive value for their services while not costing the producer more out-of-pocket expenses. Theatrical technicians are represented by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees in the United States.\n\nStagecraft and technicians can be classified into departments and jobs as follows. Not all productions will have all departments or jobs filled, and, in many cases, one technician will perform multiple jobs (even if only possessing one title).\n\n\nThis is the general name for all work involving scenery, including the deck (floor) of the stage.\n\nThis department is responsible for all of the onstage lighting for a show including, but not limited to, practicals, stage lighting and followspots. Electricians are responsible for the assembly, installation, operation and maintenance of the lighting for a production. The Electrics department is also typically in charge of any fog or haze machines used during a production, as well as the configuration of pyrotechnics and other special hardware.\n\n\nThis department is responsible for all equipment hung (flown) in the theater space. This department varies greatly from show to show, sometimes being absorbed into the Electrics or Carpentry departments. If the production incorporates personnel flying (such as in the staging of Peter Pan), there will usually be designated riggers specifically trained in flying actors. Rigging techniques and traditions come from sailing. Sailors were considered the earliest stagehands in history and many techniques used today for rigging in the theater are from standard uses on boats. Theater technicians today have also incorporated techniques from mountain climbers as well to improve the capabilities of flying equipment in the air. \n\nA theater consists of four basic rigging systems such as: hemp house, single purchase, double purchase and truss. Proper knowledge of the basic rigging systems by theater technicians is how scenery is properly built and hung over people's heads for productions. The hemp house is where all the ropes are housed in the theater and are counterweighted with sandbags. Whereas a single purchase is where the loading floor is on the stage floor in order to reduce the amount of staged space in the wings. A double purchase system works quite differently compared to a single purchase because it puts the loading floor halfway between the stage floor and the loft blocks. The truss is considered as to be the most important rigging system in theater because it consists of two or more pieces of pipe fabricated together with cross bracing. The purpose of the truss is to replace standard pipes for extremely heavy loads to be lifted. \n\nThe properties department is responsible for all hand and scenic props for a show. This usually includes furniture, weaponry and consumables (paper, food and drink) for a production. In addition to the above duties, the props department is responsible for the cleanliness of the stage floor, including sweeping and mopping of the stage surface.\n\nThe audio department is responsible for all sound production for a show, including the configuration of microphones, speakers and control equipment, as well as the production of any necessary audio tracks. Personnel in this department include:\n\n\nA rarely seen department in theatre due to the heavy restrictions on the use of true pyrotechnics and is sometimes combined with other tech departments (usually the Electrics department) is referred to as special effects. Theatrical technicians are responsible for the production and operation of explosives, special effects and illusions on sufficiently large theatrical productions. Today many of the special effects used on stage have been modernized and are extremely advanced the most commonly used effects are nature, fire, fog and haze. In order to make special effects seem more realistic on stage technicians use innovative techniques and special equipment to bring the production to life across the stage. For nature effects like wind, fans are commonly used to bring movement on stage by adjusting the speed and direction of the fan. For effects like fire, equipment is brought in to create flames and smoke and is usually operated by a licensed special effects operator. Whereas fog and haze machines are easy and accessible for technicians to use and only require fluid to be placed inside the machine to vaporize into fog and haze. These machines also have functions where the flow and speed of the fog and haze can be adjusted to control how its distributed throughout a production.\n\nThe stage manager is in control of a production during its run. Responsibilities include calling the cues and determining the starting time of the show and ensuring the safety of all persons involved. Depending on circumstances, multiple positions are possible:\n\nResponsible for the creation and maintenance of costume pieces and dressing the performers.\n\n\n"}
