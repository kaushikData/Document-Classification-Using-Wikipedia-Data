Later that year, it was released in the App Store for iOS devices. In 2014, a prequel entitled \"The Ensign\", which provided more insight into the world and its characters, was released for iOS.\n\n\"A Dark Room\" was created by Michael Townsend and released for browsers on June 10, 2013. According to Townsend, the game was designed to tell its story entirely through environmental cues, rather than relying on exposition and dialogue. In July 2013, Townsend released the source code of the game on GitHub under the open source license MPL 2.0.\nSoon, Townsend was contacted by developer Amir Rajan, who asked for permission to adapt the game for iOS. Amir ported the game to iOS using the RubyMotion mobile toolchain, and released it on the App Store in late 2013. From 2014 onwards an Android port of \"A Dark Room\" was being worked on, which was finally released in 2016.\n\nThe game begins with the player awakening in a cold, dark room after a mysterious event. Initially, the player can only light and tend a fire in the room. As the game progresses, the player gains the abilities to collect resources, interact with strangers, start a village, and explore the world. As the game progresses, the type and quantity of resources and exploration available increases. According to \"The New Yorker\", \"What follows is a strange hybrid, part mystery story and part smartphone productivity software...the game evokes the simplest text-based computer games of the nineteen-seventies while stimulating a very modern impulse to constantly check and recheck one's phone. It's like a puzzle composed of deconstructed to-do lists.\" The site added, \"You can begin to see a structure emerge from the fragments, but where that structure will lead you remains impossible to predict, and so the compulsion to keep pressing little word buttons grows stronger.\"\n\n\"TouchArcade\" gave the game a rating of 4 out of 5, writing, \"It's a strange little thing, to be sure, but I'd definitely recommend A Dark Room to people who appreciate off-beat RPGs, fans of experience-driven games, or really anyone looking for something a little bit different from usual.\" Slide to Play rated it 3 out of 4, commenting, \"It may not seem like much at first, but if you stick around long enough, it's easy to fall under A Dark Room's spell.\" 148Apps gave the game 3 out of 5, writing, \"\"A Dark Room\" may have plenty of longevity and may be genuinely intriguing, but its interface feels undeveloped in its iOS iteration.\"\n\n\"The New Yorker\" explained, \"When \"A Dark Room\" was first released on iPhone, at the end of 2013, the game was listed in a number of Best of the Year lists, including those published by Forbes, Paste, and the gaming site, Giant Bomb.\" The app \"rocketed to the most-downloaded spot in the App Store's games section in April and stayed there throughout the month\".\n\nEngadget praised the game's surprise ending, writing that \"...it's definitely worth the time it takes to find it.\"\n\n"}

He became a professional singer as a youngster. Around 1908, he toured with Guy Brother's Minstrel Show, and helped form a vaudeville act \"Weston, Fields and Carroll\".\n\nHis first hit as a songwriter was \"On the Mississippi\" (1912), which he wrote the music for with Harry Carroll and Ballard MacDonald supplied the lyrics. In 1914 he wrote the lyrics to \"Aba Daba Honeymoon\", which was revived for the 1950 M.G.M. film \"Two Weeks With Love\" and thus got a renewed popularity which brought Fields large royalty incomes during his last two years.\n\nFrom 1914 onward, he recorded with many bands and for many labels and had a varied career in the recording industry. In 1918, he was popular for his performance of his \"Hunting the Hun\" war song. His 1919 recordings with bandleader Ford Dabney may be the very first recordings of a white singer backed by a black band. For a period Fields also formed a vocal trio with brothers Jack and Irving Kaufman, billing themselves as \"The Three Kaufields\". Fields also often appeared on records under pseudonyms, for example as \"Mr X.\" on Grey Gull Records and related labels. In 1926 he recorded with Oreste Migliaccio & His Queensland Orchestra. His last records were made in the early 1940s.\n\nAmong Field's most prolific partnerships was the one with band leader and pianist Fred Hall, with whom Fields made plenty of records and co-wrote several songs, often with comic titles like \"The Shoes We Have Left Are All Right\", \"You're My Little Rhapsody in Blue\", and \"I Can't Sleep in the Movies Anymore\". Hall and Fields also broadcast together as Rex Cole's Mountaineers.\n\nRetiring to Florida in 1946 he also worked in radio on WKAT Miami. He suffered a stroke early in 1953 and was killed in a fire at Littlefield Nursing Home in Largo, Florida a little later the same year.\n\n\n"}

Gaur's plays are contemporary and thought-provoking, connecting intimate personal spheres of existence to larger social political issues. His work deals with Internet censorship, communalism, caste issues, feudalism, domestic violence, crimes of state, politics of power, violence, injustice, social discrimination, marginalisation, and racism. Arvind is the leader of Asmita, Delhi's \"most prolific theatre group\", and is an actor trainer, social activist, street theatre worker and story teller.\n\nGaur was the recipient of a research fellowship awarded by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (India) (1997–98). He was on the guest faculty of Delhi University for Theatre in education program for three years. He has conducted many theatre workshops and performed in colleges, institutions, universities and schools in India and abroad.\n\nHe organizes theatre workshops for children in schools and slums as well as street theatre performances on socio-political issues. He has directed more than hundreds stage and street plays over 25 years.\n\nHe was born on 2 February 1963 in Delhi. Arvind’s father Shri Shiva Nandan Sharma (died on 16.04.09) was a Maths scholar and his mother Saraswati Devi is a housewife. He has one brother advocate Anil Gaur and three sisters: Shashi Prabha, late Mithlesh and Dr. Anita Gaur. His wife Dr. Sangeeta Gaur.\n\nAfter completing his schooling from Model School, Vivek Vihar in Delhi, he decided to study engineering in Electronic Communication. Later, he joined the Delhi Public Library drama group. In DPL He acted in and directed plays. Then he worked with slum kids and industrial labourers for some time and conducted workshops for them. His first street play was with Zakir Hussein College, called \"Videshi Aya\". It became very popular and he staged it around 200 schools. After this, his desire to express led him to journalism. He worked with the \"Navbharat Times\" newspaper as culture columnist for about four years.\n\nWatching plays, reading about them and writing about them is how his training in theatre started. He then shifted to Press Trust of India (PTI-TV). He was associated with TV serial \"Tana-Bana\". He was in charge of the research and programming there. All through his years with street theatre, print and television, Gaur had developed keen interest in direction. Finally, after devoting two years to PTI-TV, he felt the urge to switch to theatre completely.\n\nArvind's debut play was Bhisham Sahni's \"Hanoosh\" (February, 1993). He started his theatre journey with classics like \"Tughlaq\", \"Andha Yug\", \"Caligula\", \"Julius Caesar\", etc.\n\nHe performed Girish Karnad's \"Tughlaq\" in a small basement theatre (SRC). It was a huge success. His \"Tughlaq\" was selected as \"the best play of the year 1994\" by Sahitya Kala Parishad. He achieved greater heights during a decade in theatre. He trained actors in his own style. He trained them as a complete theatre person. Arvind Gaur also collaborated with theatre artists and groups specially in exploring a new language for solo performances.\n\n\n\nGaur directed more than 40 street theatre performances on socio-political issues. He has always raised voice against any socio-political issue that effects the common public. He directed street plays like \"Corruption\", \"Garbage\", \"Road Rage\", and \"Dastak\" which is against the issue of eve teasing. His street plays are always thought-provoking and leave a huge mark on the mindset. He and his team performs socio-political street plays all across Delhi/NCR and the country. He is regarded as a man with a message who believes that change can start from society, if we wish to start the change.\nOn May 2nd 2017, Theatre and film actor Shilpi Marwaha broke her 11-year long association with Asmita Theatre Group, alleging that Arun Gaur made \"advances\" towards her. He made advances, and the moment it happened, I said no and left. It started in February 2016 in Varanasi, when we were rehearsing for a play late at night. We were discussing a script when he tried to hold my hand and made advances towards me. I left immediately and thought he would not repeat this. But it happened again after five-six months. He would say, 'Yeh toh normal cheez hai, ismein galat kya hai?' After it happened for the first time, I did not go to Asmita for many days,\" she says\n\n\n\n\nHe scripted plays like Untitled, Gandhari in search of light, I will not Cry, Bitter Chocolate (based on Pinki Virani's book), \"Madhavi\" solo play (based on Bhisham Sahni's play) and many street plays for Asmita Theatre.\n\nArvind Gaur designs lights for Naya Theatre group's major productions under the direction of Padma Shri Habib Tanvir.

Other such early links between underground comix and modern independents include Mike Friedrich's \"Star*Reach\" and Wood's own \"witzend\". Critic Ken Jones, in a 1986 retrospective review, suggested that \"Big Apple Comix\" and Mark Evanier's \"High Adventure\" may have been \"the first true alternative comics\".\n\nThe comic featured writer-editor Goodwin displaying his cartoonist abilities; Adams and a fledgling Larry Hama sharing vertically split pages to parallel a street prostitute with a corporate secretary using sex to further her career; and Wood's story \"My Word\", a bitter parody of the Al Feldstein-scripted \"My World\" that Wood illustrated in EC Comics' \"Weird Science\" #22 (Dec. 1953).

Audio engineering and RF engineering are also essential parts of broadcast engineering, being their own subsets of electrical engineering.\n\nBroadcast engineering involves both the studio and transmitter aspects (the entire airchain), as well as remote broadcasts. Every station has a broadcast engineer, though one may now serve an entire station group in a city. In small media markets the engineer may work on a contract basis for one or more stations as needed.\n\nModern duties of a broadcast engineer include maintaining broadcast automation systems for the studio and automatic transmission systems for the transmitter plant. There are also important duties regarding radio towers, which must be maintained with proper lighting and painting. Occasionally a station's engineer must deal with complaints of RF interference, particularly after a station has made changes to its transmission facilities.\n\nBroadcast engineers may have varying titles depending on their level of expertise and field specialty. Some widely used titles include:\n\nBroadcast engineers may need to possess some or all of the following degrees, depending on the broadcast technical environment. If one of the formal qualifications is not present, a related degree or equivalent professional experience is desirable.\n\nBroadcast engineers are generally required to have knowledge in the following areas, from conventional video broadcast systems to modern Information Technology:\n\n\nAbove mentioned requirements vary from station to station.\n\nThe conversion to digital broadcasting means broadcast engineers must now be well-versed in digital television and digital radio, in addition to analogue principles. New equipment from the transmitter to the radio antenna to the receiver may be encountered by engineers new to the field. Furthermore, modern techniques place a greater demand on an engineer's expertise, such as sharing broadcast towers or radio antennas among different stations (diplexing).\n\nDigital audio and digital video have revolutionized broadcast engineering in many respects. Broadcast studios and control rooms are now already digital in large part, using non-linear editing and digital signal processing for what used to take a great deal of time or money, if it was even possible at all. Mixing consoles for both audio and video are continuing to become more digital in the 2000s, as is the computer storage used to keep digital media libraries. Effects processing and TV graphics can now be realized much more easily and professionally as well.\n\nWith the broadcast industry's shift to IP-based production and content delivery technology (sometimes referred as Broadcast 3.0) not only the production technology and workflows are changing, but also the requirements for broadcast engineers, which now include IT and IP-networking knowhow.\n\nOther devices used in broadcast engineering are telephone hybrids, broadcast delays, and dead air alarms. See the glossary of broadcast engineering terms for further explanations.\n\nBroadcast stations often call upon outside engineering services for certain needs. For example, because structural engineering is generally not a direct part of broadcast engineering, tower companies usually design broadcast towers.\n\nOther companies specialize in both broadcast engineering and broadcast law, which are both essential when making an application to a national broadcasting authority for a construction permit or broadcast license. This is especially critical in North America, where stations bear the entire burden of proving that their proposed facilities will not cause interference and are the best use of the radio spectrum. Such companies now have special software that can map projected radio propagation and terrain shielding, as well as lawyers that will defend the applications before the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), or the equivalent authorities in some other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States, many broadcast engineers belong to the Society of Broadcast Engineers (SBE). Some may also belong to the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), or to organizations of related fields, such as the Audio Engineering Society or Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) - IEEE Broadcast Technology Society (BTS).\n\nFor public radio, the Association of Public Radio Engineers was created in late May 2006.\n\n\n"}

Five of the episodes are edited, with a feature-exclusive sixth, into the 2011 stereoscopic compilation movie \"Tales of the Night\".\n\nThe series, which Ocelot also voice acted in, co-produced, art directed and designed, returns to the format of short silhouette animation fairy tales established by 1989's \"Ciné si\" and continued in 1992's \"Tales of the Night\" to produce further stories originally conceived for the then-unsuccessful \"Ciné si\", episodes of which have since enjoyed popularity in the form of the compilation movie \"Princes and Princesses\".\n\nAt least as early as September 2006, when \"\" was previewing in France, Ocelot was mentioning in interviews that he was planning to return to silhouettes and the anthology format with a project then planned to be titled \"Bergères et Dragons\" (\"Shepherdesses and Dragons\") and released in 2008 but wavered on whether it would it take the format of a feature film or television series and if it would consist of a combination of existing and new or all-new footage (the title suggests the inclusion of the \"Bergère qui danse\" segment of the earlier \"Tales of the Night\"). Instead, 2008 saw the inclusion of these earlier silhouette films in the \"Les Trésors cachés de Michel Ocelot\" short film collection and the new project, set back by production of several others, was announced in June 2010 as taking its eventual form of both a television series of ten new silhouette films and a new \"Tales of the Night\" for movie theaters drawn from it.\n\n\"Dragons\" also notably sees him return to working with once-regular composer Christian Maire, who had last scored \"Ciné si\" for him two decades ago, and is the first production animated by his own Studio O in Paris, which previously had covered only pre-production for projects animated at larger animation studios. A total of over 300 characters and 800 sets were designed for the project, which was animated by a team of five in Autodesk Maya.\n\nAt least two of the episodes had pre-television premieres, with \"L'Élue de la Ville d'or\" (\"The Electress of the City of Gold\") screening at the \"Festival international de cinéma d'animation de Meknès\" in May 2010 and \"Le Garçon qui ne mentait jamais\" (\"The Boy Who Never Lied\") in competition for the \"Cristal\" for best TV production at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival in June, for which it lost out to Studio Soi's \"Der Kleine und das Biest\" (\"The Little Boy and the Beast\") but was instead given a special award for a television series.

Roy takes Nathan swimming with Burke and Randy, but Nathan admits he can't swim. While watching Roy, Burke threatens to throw him in the water, but Roy stops him. While Roy is driving them home, he pulls onto the side of the road and they start kissing. When Nathan starts to have sex with Roy, Roy angrily stops him, asking \"who taught [him] to screw like that\". Nathan swears \"no one\".\n\nWhen Nathan gets home that night, his father wants to know if he had a good time. Nathan is on the brink of tears as he answers his father. He ties a string up to his dresser drawer and bedpost, tucks his pillows under his sheets, and moves to the floor to sleep. In the night he hears a thud and runs from his room, because it's his father sneaking in. It is later revealed that his father had touched him in the past inappropriately. Nathan sleeps outside and comes home only for meals, but returns to his tree outside after eating.\n\nRoy finds him and offers him a place to sleep in his family's barn. The next morning, Nathan goes home for breakfast and his father catches him, yelling at him to not run from him, but Nathan's mother interrupts and he runs to the school bus. Later, Roy tells Nathan they're going camping with Burke and Randy that weekend. That night, Roy tells ghost stories around the campfire, and in their tent, Nathan gives Roy a blowjob, and Roy asks him if he minds when Roy doesn't do those things back to him, and Nathan says he doesn't mind. Hiking through the woods, the boys find an old plantation house. They go inside to investigate, and Nathan hears a voice call his name, resembling his father's. They then find cloth with what looks like to be blood on it, and they smell sulfur (which Nathan says is the smell of the Devil), and the boys see a shadow move up the stairs.\n\nBurke takes the flashlight from Roy and goes to investigate with Randy. Roy and Nathan go into a bedroom and talk, and Nathan says he feels as if he'll never leave that house. He hears the voice again and Roy goes to see if the guys are back. Nathan sees his father and closes his eyes tight, when Roy enters the room again. He tells Nathan not to look at whatever he's seeing anymore and kisses him. Roy gets down on his knees and proceeds to fellate Nathan, when Burke and Randy find them. Roy storms out of the room, and Nathan hears the voice again, and is suddenly knocked unconscious. A shadow of a person carries him up the stairs.\n\nIn the attic, Burke rapes Nathan, and realizing what he's done, disgusted with himself, he breaks an arm off a rocking chair and knocks Nathan over the head with it. Blood starts pooling on the floor beneath Nathan's head, and Burke leaves him in the attic. When Roy and Randy find Nathan early the next morning, he appears to be dead. Roy tells Randy to go on and find Burke, whom he says he doesn't believe at this point about what happened. Roy cries once Randy leaves, then Roy leaves too. The police arrive, bringing Nathan's father who tearfully covers Nathan's face with a blanket.\n\nNathan awakens from a coma, or resurrected if he died, gets up and leaves the plantation house. He wanders for a long time still dazed from the blow to his head. Finally he sees Roy coming out of Sunday evening church, but Roy is with his family, so Nathan wanders around some more waiting for Roy to get home. Nathan's mother leaves his father, and Nathan, his head now clear, finds Roy crying in the barn where Nathan slept while hiding from his father. As Roy looks up, he sees Nathan and hugs him.\n\nAt the end of the story, Roy is driving the bus and looks in the mirror to an empty seat, but when he looks a second time, Nathan is there smiling at him.\n\nThe movie departs from the novel and leaves the impression that Nathan is truly dead, and that the previous scenes were a wishful dream sequence of one of the two boy lovers, presumably Roy. In the book this scene does not take place. The book has the boys meeting in the yard of Roy's church, running together into the woods to talk things over, and deciding to run away together since Roy has been seen sucking Nathan by both Burke and Randy, and both boys will surely will be outed to their families and the whole community. The book ends with: \"They hear the voices of people searching for them in the woods. They stand and go. They never look back.\"\n\n\n\"Dream Boy\" first screened at the Berlin International Film Festival in Germany on February 12, 2008. Its first American screening was on October 24, 2008 at the Chicago International Film Festival. The film was released on DVD in North America on August 24, 2010.\n\nOn the North American DVD release, albeit a given R rating for \"sexual content, and some violence including a rape — involving teens\", before starting the film, an MPAA block gives the film a PG-13 for \"thematic elements involving sexuality, and language\".\n\n"}

{"id": "317419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317419", "title": "Game complexity", "text": "Game complexity\n\nCombinatorial game theory has several ways of measuring game complexity. This article describes five of them: state-space complexity, game tree size, decision complexity, game-tree complexity, and computational complexity.\n\nThe state-space complexity of a game is the number of legal game positions reachable from the initial position of the game.\n\nWhen this is too hard to calculate, an upper bound can often be computed by including illegal positions or positions that can never arise in the course of a game.\n\nThe game tree size is the total number of possible games that can be played: the number of leaf nodes in the game tree rooted at the game's initial position.\n\nThe game tree is typically vastly larger than the state space because the same positions can occur in many games by making moves in a different order (for example, in a tic-tac-toe game with two X and one O on the board, this position could have been reached in two different ways depending on where the first X was placed). An upper bound for the size of the game tree can sometimes be computed by simplifying the game in a way that only increases the size of the game tree (for example, by allowing illegal moves) until it becomes tractable.\n\nHowever, for games where the number of moves is not limited (for example by the size of the board, or by a rule about repetition of position) the game tree is infinite.\n\nThe next two measures use the idea of a \"decision tree\", which is a subtree of the game tree, with each position labelled with \"player A wins\", \"player B wins\" or \"drawn\", if that position can be proved to have that value (assuming best play by both sides) by examining only other positions in the graph. (Terminal positions can be labelled directly; a position with player A to move can be labelled \"player A wins\" if any successor position is a win for A, or labelled \"player B wins\" if all successor positions are wins for B, or labelled \"draw\" if all successor positions are either drawn or wins for B. And correspondingly for positions with B to move.)\n\nDecision complexity of a game is the number of leaf nodes in the smallest decision tree that establishes the value of the initial position.\n\nThe game-tree complexity of a game is the number of leaf nodes in the smallest \"full-width\" decision tree that establishes the value of the initial position. A full-width tree includes all nodes at each depth.\n\nThis is an estimate of the number of positions one would have to evaluate in a minimax search to determine the value of the initial position.\n\nIt is hard even to estimate the game-tree complexity, but for some games a reasonable lower bound can be given by raising the game's average branching factor to the power of the number of plies in an average game, or:\n\nformula_1.\n\nThe computational complexity of a game describes the asymptotic difficulty of a game as it grows arbitrarily large, expressed in big O notation or as membership in a complexity class. This concept doesn't apply to particular games, but rather to games that have been generalized so they can be made arbitrarily large, typically by playing them on an \"n\"-by-\"n\" board. (From the point of view of computational complexity a game on a fixed size of board is a finite problem that can be solved in O(1), for example by a look-up table from positions to the best move in each position.)\n\nThe asymptotic complexity is defined by the most efficient (in terms of whatever computational resource one is considering) algorithm for solving the game; the most common complexity measure (computation time) is always lower-bounded by the logarithm of the asymptotic state-space complexity, since a solution algorithm must work for every possible state of the game. It will be upper-bounded by the complexities of each individual algorithm for the family of games. Similar remarks apply to the second-most commonly used complexity measure, the amount of space or computer memory used by the computation. It is not obvious that there is any lower bound on the space complexity for a typical game, because the algorithm need not store game states; however many games of interest are known to be PSPACE-hard, and it follows that their space complexity will be lower-bounded by the logarithm of the asymptotic state-space complexity as well (technically the bound is only a polynomial in this quantity; but it is usually known to be linear).\n\nFor tic-tac-toe, a simple upper bound for the size of the state space is 3 = 19,683. (There are three states for each cell and nine cells.) This count includes many illegal positions, such as a position with five crosses and no noughts, or a position in which both players have a row of three. A more careful count, removing these illegal positions, gives 5,478. And when rotations and reflections of positions are considered identical, there are only 765 essentially different positions.\n\nA simple upper bound for the size of the game tree is 9! = 362,880. (There are nine positions for the first move, eight for the second, and so on.) This includes illegal games that continue after one side has won. A more careful count gives 255,168 possible games. When rotations and reflections of positions are considered the same, there are only 26,830 possible games.\n\nThe computational complexity of tic-tac-toe depends on how it is generalized. A natural generalization is to \"m\",\"n\",\"k\"-games: played on an \"m\" by \"n\" board with winner being the first player to get \"k\" in a row. It is immediately clear that this game can be solved in DSPACE(\"mn\") by searching the entire game tree. This places it in the important complexity class PSPACE. With some more work it can be shown to be PSPACE-complete.\n\nDue to the large size of game complexities, this table gives the ceiling of their logarithm to base 10. (In other words, the number of digits). All of the following numbers should be considered with caution: seemingly-minor changes to the rules of a game can change the numbers (which are often rough estimates anyway) by tremendous factors, which might easily be much greater than the numbers shown.\n\nNote: ordered by game tree size\n\n\n"}

In addition to composing the songs for the 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\" (lyrics by E.Y. Harburg), including the classic \"Over the Rainbow\", Arlen is a highly regarded contributor to the Great American Songbook. \"Over the Rainbow\" was voted the 20th century's No. 1 song by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).\n\nArlen was born in Buffalo, New York, United States, the child of a cantor. His twin brother died the next day. He learned to play the piano as a youth, and formed a band as a young man. He achieved some local success as a pianist and singer before moving to New York City in his early twenties, where he worked as an accompanist in vaudeville and changed his name to Harold Arlen. Between 1926 and about 1934, Arlen appeared occasionally as a band vocalist on records by The Buffalodians, Red Nichols, Joe Venuti, Leo Reisman, and Eddie Duchin, usually singing his own compositions.\n\nIn 1929, Arlen composed his first well-known song: \"Get Happy\" (with lyrics by Ted Koehler). Throughout the early and mid-1930s, Arlen and Koehler wrote shows for the Cotton Club, a popular Harlem night club, as well as for Broadway musicals and Hollywood films. Arlen and Koehler's partnership resulted in a number of hit songs, including the familiar standards \"Let's Fall in Love\" and \"Stormy Weather\". Arlen continued to perform as a pianist and vocalist with some success, most notably on records with Leo Reisman's society dance orchestra.\n\nArlen's compositions have always been popular with jazz musicians because of his facility at incorporating a blues feeling into the idiom of the American popular song.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, Arlen married, and spent increasing time in California, writing for movie musicals. It was at this time that he began working with lyricist E. Y. \"Yip\" Harburg. In 1938, the team was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to compose songs for \"The Wizard of Oz\", the most famous of which is \"Over the Rainbow\", for which they won the Academy Award for Best Music, Original Song. They also wrote \"Down with Love\" (featured in the 1937 Broadway show \"Hooray for What!\"), \"Lydia the Tattooed Lady\", for Groucho Marx in \"At the Circus\" in 1939, and \"Happiness is a Thing Called Joe\", for Ethel Waters in the 1943 movie \"Cabin in the Sky\".\n\nArlen was a longtime friend and onetime roommate of actor Ray Bolger, who starred in \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nIn the 1940s, he teamed up with lyricist Johnny Mercer, and continued to write hit songs like \"Blues in the Night\", \"Out of this World\", \"That Old Black Magic\", \"Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive\", \"Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home\", \"Come Rain or Come Shine\" and \"One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)\".\n\nArlen composed two defining tunes which bookend Judy Garland's musical persona: as a yearning, innocent girl in \"Over the Rainbow\" and a world-weary, \"chic chanteuse\" with \"The Man That Got Away\", the last written for the 1954 version of the film \"A Star Is Born\".\n\nArlen died of cancer at his Manhattan apartment at the age of eighty-one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1448126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1448126", "title": "Irish Film Classification Office", "text": "Irish Film Classification Office\n\nThe Irish Film Classification Office (IFCO) () is the organisation responsible for films, television programmes, and some video game classification and censorship within Ireland. Where restrictions are placed by the IFCO, they are legally binding.\n\nPrior to 21 July 2008, the office was branded as the \"Irish Film Censor's Office\", and was previously known as simply the \"Film Censor's Office\", or, in legal references, the office of the \"Official Censor of Films\", which was the official title of the head of the office prior to that date. The head of the office is the Director of Film Classification.\n\nThe Irish Film Censor's Office was set up in 1923, in accordance with the Censorship of Films Act, 1923. This law was amended in 1925, 1930, 1970, and 1992; and a substantial revision of the law occurred in the Video Recordings Act, 1989 which extended the remit of the office to the regulation of the video importation and supply industry. On 21 July 2008 the \"Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008\" came into force. Section 70 changes some of the provisions with regard censorship of films in the State. Section 71 renames the Film Censor as the Director of Film Classification and consequent to this, the Irish Film Censor's Office became the Irish Film Classification Office.\n\nThe office consists of 21 staff members:\n\nThe 10 assistant classifiers are paid €168 per day and are entitled to claim expenses on top of this. According to a freedom of information request granted to the Irish edition of the \"Sunday Times\" the assistant classifiers claimed €306,683 in fees and €52,569 of expenses in 2007; €339,608 in fees and €49,898 of expenses in 2008; and €162,263 in fees and €21,401 of expenses for the first half of 2009. This equates to a payment of approximately €60 per film rated.\n\nBefore 1965, there were no certificates and all films were tailored for a general audience, resulting in several bans and cuts (no doubt also due to extremely conservative societal standards). As of 2004, 2,500 theatrical films had been banned and about 11,000 cut, largely from before the overhaul.\n\nPublic controversy over the office's harsh methods came to a head in late 1964 - in 1963 alone, 31 films were rejected and 156 were cut. Critically acclaimed hits were no exception - Dr. Strangelove was cut, including Ripper's reference to Communists trying to \"sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids\" with fluoridated water, and Irish-shot medical drama Of Human Bondage was banned due to the heroine dying of syphilis. Even after the ban was overturned the following year, it still received an over-18's certificate with cuts - nude sculptures made by Auguste Rodin were removed from the background of the title sequence.\nThe appointment of a new Justice Minister, Brian Lenihan, in October 1964 coincided with this outrage. He met with the Cinema and Theatre Association in November to consider their views and even proposed to view recently banned films, including \"Of Human Bondage\". On 28 November, Lenihan announced he'd be appointing a new Film Appeals Board and would be able to reform censorship without changing existing legislation. - film correspondent Fergus Linehan pointed out that the 1923 Act explicitly supported age certification:\nLenihan announced the new Appeals board in January 1965, which came into effect on 18 January. Their main task was to begin enforcing limited certificates (alongside the general certificate)\n, which were as follows, according to the Appeals Board chairman:\n\nAll bar the last are still enforced today under different names.\n\nThe current cinematic certificates were announced on December 2004 at the European Conference of Film Classifiers in Paris and introduced on 1 January 2005:\n\n\nThese were introduced on 1 September 1994:\n\n\nFrom that date it was an offence to trade uncertified videos, which carried fines of up to £1000 and a maximum sentence of three years. Additional rates came in at £180 per rental title, £80 per sale title and £20 per advert/trailer. This limited the market, especially for London distributors whose releases previously went to Ireland automatically.\n\nThe current certificates for home video formats such as DVD and Blu-ray that are issued are:\n\n\nA retired certificate only used on home video is:\n\n\nThis is the crossover, or change, in a certificate that will happen when a film which has been shown in cinemas, is released on home video, but this only applies if:\n\n\nExamples of the former include Bullet to the Head, Get Hard and the 40th anniversary edition of Halloween, which all received 15 certificates individually but whose overall releases are 18's due to additional material.\n\nThe standard crossovers are as follows:\n\nNote: The certificate \"12RA\" did not have a corresponding cinematic certificate, and thus, did not have a standard crossover (certain 12A films received the certificate before it was withdrawn in the mid 2000s).\n\nIf the two rules above apply to a film's home video release, then, generally, it will be re-rated completely, \"but\" this does not mean certificates will always coincide for all formats, as occasionally (usually the DVD or Blu-ray) one edition will contain extra features while the other does not, causing one to be re-rated, and the other to take a Standard Crossover (for instance, a film which received a 15A certificate in cinemas may have received a 15 certificate on VHS but an 18 certificate on DVD; usually DVDs in these circumstances would carry a label on the reverse, informing viewers of this).\n\nUntil February 2009, the home video certificates were always the certificate surrounded by an octagon, followed by the words \"FILM CENSOR'S OFFICE\" and \"OIFIG SCRÚDÓIR NA SCANNÁN\", which were then surrounded by another, larger, octagon. The colours were cyan and white, but the order they appear in varied. Although the Office was renamed in July 2008, these continued to bear the old name until February 2009, when they were altered to read \"IRISH FILM CLASSIFICATION OFFICE\" and its Irish equivalent.\n\nUnlike the BBFC in the UK, which prior to PEGI ratings becoming legally enforceable in the UK on 30 July 2012 rated video games that met certain criteria (such as very graphic violence), the Irish Film Censor's Office does not usually rate video games, leaving ratings to PEGI, unless the game's content is deemed prohibitable under section 3 (1) of the Act.\n\nIFCO ratings for video games were introduced in 2001 and retired in 2003. Although the Silent Hill Collection was released in 2006, it contained re-releases of the second and third games, which were rated and released in 2001 and 2003 respectively.\n\nOnly 9 games have ever been submitted to and rated by the IFCO:\nDespite the lack of legally binding ratings, most (if not all) video game retailers attempt to prohibit the sale of PEGI 18+ rated games to people under the age of 18, and prior to PEGI ratings the same was done with BBFC 18 ratings on games (the same packaging is usually used in games sold in Ireland as in the UK).\n\nThe only prohibition notice for a video game was issued for \"Manhunt 2\" in 2007.\n\nAll decisions made with regard to certification, may be appealed for up to 6 months after the certificate is initially issued. An appeal is issued to the Classification of Films Appeal Board.\n\nWorks may also be submitted for re-classification after seven years since the original certification have passed (not an appeal \"per se\", but rather seen as an update of classification based on current standards).\n\nThe most recent example of a (failed) appeal is The First Purge, which received an 18 certificate for \"strong bloody violence, sustained threat and disturbing scenes\". The distributor (Universal Pictures) argued the case for a 16 certificate:\n\nAfter first being viewed on 15 June, it was re-viewed on 21 June when the Appeal Board stuck by the original decision.\n\nGer Connolly wrote back, explaining the decision in greater detail:\n\nFilms may be refused a certificate, e.g. on grounds of obscenity. Such films may not be shown in public cinemas or sold in shops, but are not \"ipso facto\" banned and have been shown at film festivals and art house clubs such as the Irish Film Theatre and Irish Film Institute. These may also show films which have not been submitted for certification, as the submission fee may be prohibitive if a film is screened only a few times at a small venue.\n\nProhibitions and revocations, with justification, are listed in the official gazette, Iris Oifigiúil, under the headings of PROHIBITION ORDER and REVOCATION ORDER.\n\nDespite the recommendations in the 2000 review of certification that no further films be banned, bans are still occasionally issued, although usually overturned on appeal. \"Boy Eats Girl\", a 2005 movie, was initially banned, with the option of a cut being provided to the producers. On appeal, the film was passed uncut, and granted a 15A rating, although the video certificate was raised to 18.\n\nMovies which are never submitted for cinema release in Ireland are occasionally banned on attempted video releases, although only one such order was made in 2004, banning the pornographic \"Anabolic Initiations 5\" (IMDb link), with the appeals board upholding the censor's order. One order was issued in 2005, reiterating the ban on \"Deep Throat\". The only order in 2006 banned the pornographic film \"Steal Runaway\".\n\nFilms and videos prohibited by the Classifier/Censor include:\nFor a more detailed list with dates and justification, see here.\n\nLike many systems of entertainment classification, the IFCO has received criticism for several decisions they have made in the past. The board has been described as too zealous and conservative. Many titles that receive 15 certificates from the BBFC are rated 18 by the IFCO. DVD examples include \"Kick-Ass\" and \"Black Swan\". Rarer cinema examples (which bypass the 16 rating) include \"Free Fire\" and \"You Were Never Really Here\".\n\nHowever, the IFCO are more lenient with strong language than the BBFC are, especially with very strong language (e.g. 'cunt'). Examples include \"Frost/Nixon\" and \"The Visitor\" receiving 15 certificates in the UK but PG's in Ireland despite the use of the stronger term 'motherfucker', and \"Gone Girl\" receiving an 18 in the UK but a 15 (on DVD) in Ireland despite four aggressive uses of 'cunt'. The 2014 documentary \"Red Army\" received a 12A in Ireland but a 15 in the UK for a single use of 'cocksucker' (although the video rating was upgraded to 15).\n\nThree titles in particular drew criticism of the board: \"Election\", \"But I'm a Cheerleader\" and \"Brokeback Mountain\".

{"id": "44373565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44373565", "title": "Life Is Strange", "text": "Life Is Strange\n\nLife Is Strange is an episodic graphic adventure video game developed by Dontnod Entertainment and published by Square Enix for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One and Android. The game was released in five episodes periodically throughout 2015. The game's plot focuses on Max Caulfield, an 18-year-old photography student who discovers that she has the ability to rewind time at any moment, leading her every choice to enact the butterfly effect. After having foreseen an approaching storm, Max must take on the responsibility to prevent it from destroying her town. The player's actions will adjust the narrative as it unfolds, and reshape it once allowed to travel back in time. Fetch quests and making environmental changes represent the forms of puzzle solving in addition to using branching choices for conversation.\n\nDevelopment of \"Life Is Strange\" began in April 2013. It was formed with an episodic format in mind, for reasons both financial and creative. The developers conducted field research on the setting by travelling to the Pacific Northwest, and subverted known archetypes to make the characters. Player feedback influenced the adjustments made to the episodes. Story and character arc serve as the central point in the game. During its release, \"Life Is Strange\" received generally favourable reviews commending the character development, rewind game mechanic and tackling of taboo subjects. Common criticisms included the slang that was used, poor lip-syncing in earlier episodes, and tonal inconsistencies in the story. It received over 75 Game of the Year awards and listings. It has sold over three million copies as of May 2017. A sequel, \"Life Is Strange 2\", was released in September 2018.\n\n\"Life Is Strange\" is a graphic adventure played from a third-person view. The mechanic of rewinding time allows the player to redo any action that has been taken. The player can examine and interact with objects, which enables puzzle solving in the form of fetch quests and making changes to the environment. Items that are collected before time travelling will be kept in the inventory after the fact.\n\nThe player can explore various locations in the fictional setting of Arcadia Bay and communicate with non-playable characters. Dialogue exchanges can be rewound while branching options are used for conversation. Once an event is reset, the details provided earlier are permitted to avail themselves in the future.\nIn some instances, choices in dialogue will alter and affect the story through short or long-term consequences. For each one of the choices, something good in the short-term could turn out worse later.\n\n\"Life Is Strange\" is set in the fictional town of Arcadia Bay, Oregon, and is told from the perspective of Maxine \"Max\" Caulfield (Hannah Telle), a twelfth grade student attending Blackwell Academy during October 2013. During photography class with her teacher Mark Jefferson (Derek Phillips), Max experiences a vision of a lighthouse being destroyed by a swelling tornado. Leaving for the restroom to regain her composure, she witnesses classmate Nathan Prescott (Nik Shriner) kill a woman in a fit of rage. In a single, sudden effort, she develops the ability to rewind time and rescues the girl, revealed to be her childhood friend Chloe Price (Ashly Burch). The two reunite and go for a walk at the lighthouse, where Max reveals to Chloe her capacity to travel back in time. It is established that the vision is rather the reckoning of a future event: a storm approaching the town. The next day, Max observes fellow student Kate Marsh (Dayeanne Hutton) being bullied for a viral video depicting her kissing several students at a party.\n\nMeeting Chloe at the diner where her mother Joyce (Cissy Jones) works, they decide to experiment with Max's power at Chloe's secret scrapyard hideout. However, strain causes Max to have a nosebleed and faint. Chloe takes her back to Blackwell, but class is halted when everyone is called out to the courtyard. Kate commits suicide by jumping off the roof of the girls' dorm. Max manages to rewind and time stops unexpectedly as she reaches Kate, giving Max the opportunity to convince her to come down. Max ultimately resolves to uncover what happened to Kate and Chloe's missing friend Rachel Amber. Max and Chloe break into the principal's office that night to investigate and enter the pool for a swim before evading David Madsen (Don McManus), head of security at Blackwell and Chloe's stepfather, and fleeing back to Chloe's place. The next morning, they sneak into the motorhome of Frank Bowers (Daniel Bonjour), drug dealer and friend of Rachel, and learn that Rachel was in a relationship with Frank and lied to Chloe about it, causing Chloe to storm off feeling betrayed. Max returns to her dormitory and examines a childhood photo of her and Chloe, but is suddenly transported to the day the picture was taken. Max prevents Chloe's father William (Joe Ochman) from dying in a traffic collision, which inadvertently creates an alternative reality where William is alive but Chloe has been paralysed from the neck down as a result of a collision in her own car.\n\nMax uses the photo to undo her decision and return to the present day, restoring Chloe's health. Continuing their investigation, Max and Chloe obtain clues leading them to an abandoned barn owned by the influential Prescott family. They discover a hidden bunker containing pictures of Kate and Rachel tied up and intoxicated, with Rachel being buried at Chloe's secret hideout. They hurry back to the scrapyard and find Rachel's grave, much to Chloe's despair. Max follows Chloe at the school party to confront Nathan, believing he will target fellow student Victoria Chase (Dani Knights). They receive a text from Nathan threatening to destroy the evidence, returning them to the scrapyard. All of a sudden, the two are ambushed by Jefferson, who anaesthetises Max and kills Chloe with a shot to the head. Max is kidnapped and held captive in the \"Dark Room\", a place Jefferson has been drugging and photographing young girls to capture their innocence. Jefferson also reveals that he took Nathan on as a personal student, but killed him before abducting Max due to him giving Rachel an overdose when he tried to mimic Jefferson's work, and intends to do the same to Max after he has the photos he wants. Max escapes into a photograph and emerges back at the beginning in Jefferson's class. She alerts David, getting Jefferson (and Nathan) arrested.\n\nMax is given the opportunity to go to San Francisco and have one of her photos displayed in an art gallery. She calls Chloe from the event, realizing that, for all her effort, the storm has reached Arcadia Bay. Max travels back to the time at which she took the gallery photo, which eventually leads her to sojourn alternative realities as they devolve into a dreamscape nightmare. Max and Chloe finally return to the lighthouse and confront the fact that Max brought the storm into existence by saving Chloe from being shot by Nathan earlier in the week. The only way to prevent it is for Max to go back to that moment via a photo she took and allow Chloe to be killed by Nathan. Max must make a choice: sacrifice Chloe's life to save Arcadia Bay, or sacrifice Arcadia Bay to spare Chloe.\n\n\"Life Is Strange\" was Dontnod Entertainment's second title with a female protagonist. Dontnod published a developer diary that said most prospective publishers were unwilling to publish a game unless it had a male protagonist. Most publishers had the same objection to Dontnod's first project, \"Remember Me\". Dontnod CEO Oskar Guilbert also challenged the idea at the start. Square Enix was the only publisher with no intention to change the female protagonist. Dontnod co-founder Jean-Maxime Moris said gender equality in video games was \"a great debate to have\", but \"we're not pretending to address the issue or use the issue to stand out from the rest\".\n\nDevelopment of \"Life Is Strange\" began in April 2013 with a team of 15, and more people were added when the collaboration with Square Enix began. Dontnod told Square Enix about \"Life Is Strange\" only after Square Enix turned down a pitch for a larger game. Before signing with Square Enix, \"Life Is Strange\" was imagined as a full-length video game that Dontnod would self-publish. However, the publisher surmised that it would be more successful as an episodic title. The game was originally codenamed \"What If\" but then retitled to distinguish itself from the film of the same name. \"Life Is Strange\" was born of the idea for the rewind mechanic, which the developer had already experimented on with their last game \"Remember Me\". The lead character Max was created with the ability to rewind time to supplement this mechanism. The episodic format was decided upon by the studio for creative reasons, financial restrictions and marketing purposes, allowing them to tell the story in its preferred slow pace. The Pacific Northwest was picked as the setting for the purpose of conveying a nostalgic and autumnal feel to the game. The development team visited the region, took photographs, looked at local newspapers and used Google Street View to make sure the environment was accurately portrayed.\n\nIt was decided early on that most of the budget be spent on the writing and voice actors. The original story was written in French by Jean-Luc Cano, and converted into a game script by the co-directors and design team. It was subsequently handed over to Christian Divine and Cano to be fine tuned in English. Story and character development were highlighted over point-and-click puzzles, making choice and consequence integral to how the narrative unfolds. Hannah Telle auditioned for Max Caulfield in July 2014 and was offered the part; Ashly Burch auditioned for both Max and her given role Chloe Price. The recording sessions were done in Los Angeles, California, with the French developer brought in via Skype.\n\nAlthough it holds significant differences from \"Remember Me\", the game addresses similar themes of memory and identity. \"Life Is Strange\" was specified as an analogue look at human identity in contrast to \"Remember Me\", the digital view of the same theme. Running on an improved version of Unreal Engine 3, it makes use of the tools and special effects like lighting and depth of field engineered for \"Remember Me\" as well as subsequent advances. Visual effects like post-processes, double exposure and overlapping screen space particles were used as an artistic approach to be displayed while the lead character rewinds time. The textures seen in the game were entirely hand painted, adapted to achieve what art director Michel Koch called \"impressionistic rendering\". Elements were adjusted based on player feedback, with influences like \"The Walking Dead\", \"Gone Home\" and \"Heavy Rain\" in mind. \"The Catcher in the Rye\" was an additional source of inspiration, whose protagonist Holden Caulfield shares a surname with Max, the game's lead. The characters were created using known archetypes, at first to establish an entry point for the player, and then to subvert them. For the sake of serving the realism, the supernatural elements were designed as a metaphor for the characters' inner conflict, and experts were consulted to tackle the subject of teen suicide.\n\nThe score was composed by Jonathan Morali of the band Syd Matters. Inspired by modern indie folk music, the soundtrack was intended to inform the mood of the game. The music contains a blend of licensed tracks and composed pieces. Featured artists include José González, Mogwai, Breton, Amanda Palmer, Brian Viglione, Bright Eyes, Message to Bears, Local Natives, Syd Matters, Sparklehorse, Angus & Julia Stone, alt-J, Mud Flow and Foals.\n\nSquare Enix and Dontnod announced \"Life Is Strange\" on 11 August 2014. The episodes were released digitally on PC via Steam, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 via PlayStation Network, and Xbox 360 and Xbox One via Xbox Live between 30 January 2015 and 20 October 2015. In November 2014, the publisher said they were interested in releasing physical copies of the game, but said that at that time they were \"100 per cent focused on the digital release\". One year later, the retail edition was set to be released for the PC, PS4 and Xbox One in North America on 19 January 2016 and in Europe on 22 January 2016; the limited edition had an artbook, the soundtrack, score, and a director's commentary. A Japanese version was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 on 3 March 2016. Feral Interactive ported \"Life Is Strange\" for OS X, released on 16 June 2016, and Linux, released on 21 July 2016. That same day, the first episode was made indefinitely available for free on Linux, Windows, OS X, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. \"Life Is Strange\" was included on PlayStation Plus for the month of June 2017. It was released for iOS on 14 December 2017, and launched on Android in July 2018, both ported by Black Wing Foundation.\n\n\"Life Is Strange\" received generally favourable reviews, with a Metacritic score of 85/100 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. While some reviewers criticised the games's lip-syncing and use of dated slang, they lauded the character development and time travel component, suggesting that there should be more games like it. \"Eurogamer\" said it was \"one of the best interactive story games of this generation\" and \"Hardcore Gamer\" said it was the sleeper hit of 2015. \"Life Is Strange\" received over 75 Game of the Year awards and listings. In April 2017, \"Xbox One UK\" ranked it first in its list of Xbox One games priced under . Game director Yoko Taro listed it as one of his favourite PlayStation 4 games.\n\nKevin VanOrd of \"GameSpot\" said \"Episode 1: Chrysalis\" is \"an involving slice of life that works because its situations eloquently capture a peculiar early-college state of mind\", while \"Game Informer\"s Kimberley Wallace said the game's tackling of \"subjects that are usually taboo for video games\" was impressive. \"Destructoid\"s Brett Makedonski said the episode's strongest characteristic was exploration—both \"self- and worldly\". Mitch Dyer of \"IGN\" said the story was ultimately obstructed by its \"laughable\" script and \"worse performances\". In response to \"Episode 2: Out of Time\", \"Polygon\"s Megan Farokhmanesh also said that the emphasis on self-exploration had considerable impact on the enjoyment of the game. Other critics said the ending was an \"emotional high point\" and that it brought meaning to the choices from both the first and second episodes. Mike Williams said in \"USgamer\" that the pacing of \"Episode 2: Out of Time\" was \"slower and less exciting\" than that of episode one.\n\nAdnan Riaz of \"Hardcore Gamer\" said \"Episode 3: Chaos Theory\" was a dramatic improvement that presented a \"thrilling, poignant, fascinating and ... enticing\" narrative whose outcome from past decisions also added a sense of realism. Peter Paras of \"Game Revolution\" complimented the character beats, particularly the development of Chloe Price, who he said \"really comes into her own as [a] fully-formed character\". Though \"GameSpot\"s Alexa Ray Corriea said that the fetch quests interfered with its emotional quality, the episode built up to a \"killer cliffhanger\" according to Farokhmanesh. \"GameZone\"s Matt Liebl said \"Episode 4: Dark Room\" was \"easily the most emotional episode\" and that the mystery of Rachel Amber had done a \"tremendous job in keeping us hooked\". Tom Hoggins of \"The Telegraph\" said the developer's venture into subjects like social division, online bullying, parental conflict and suicide as \"bold\". Critics said there were tonal problems, caused by the game's \"cheap ways\" of progressing the plot, such as character inconsistency and superfluous shock value. Critics were more favourable towards the episode's puzzles and relationships. They said the final episode, \"Polarized\", had a \"fitting conclusion\" to the coming of age story of Max Caulfield and the relationship between the two leads was carried out successfully. One stealth sequence was described as \"tedious\" and \"out-of-place\" while other aspects inhabiting the same course of events were favoured. Reviewers were divided on the ending.\n\nThe first episode was ranked fifth among the best selling PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 video games of February 2015. \"Life Is Strange\" reached one million sales in July 2015, having accumulated over 1.2 million unique players worldwide; the attach rate to units between the complete season and season pass proved to be \"extremely strong\", divulged Square Enix. The retail edition made seventh place in the top ten UK game sales chart for the week ending 23 January 2016. \"Life Is Strange\" was one of the top 100 best-selling games on Steam in 2016. As of May 2017, more than three million copies have been sold.\n\nAfter \"Life Is Strange\" achieved financial and commercial success, Dontnod Entertainment started to become more prominent in the video game industry; publishers pursued the studio for the first time, whereas they previously had to pursue publishers themselves. CEO Oskar Guilbert said that the game saved his company financially after the mediocre sales of \"Remember Me\".\n\nIn 2016, Square Enix sponsored its own \"Everyday Heroes\" photography contest, inspired by the game, offering a scholarship for the winning entry. Square Enix also coordinated with Parent Advocacy Coalition for Educational Rights (PACER) to support an anti-bullying inititive based on themes within the game.\n\nIn July 2016, Legendary Digital Studios and Square Enix, in conjunction with dj2 Entertainment announced that they would be adapting \"Life Is Strange\" as a digital series. Legendary said that, at the time of the announcement, they were meeting with potential writers for the series adaptation, which would be set in Arcadia Bay. \"\", a three-part prequel developed by Deck Nine, launched on 31 August 2017. A free spin-off called \"The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit\" was announced and released in June 2018. \"Life Is Strange 2\" was released on 27 September 2018, featuring a new location and cast of characters. A four-issue comic book series of the same name, set after the \"Sacrifice Arcadia Bay\" ending of the game, was released by Titan Comics in November 2018. It was written by Emma Vieceli, with interior and cover art by Claudia Leonardi and colors by Andrea Izzo. Square Enix also partnered with Titan Comics to produce \"Life Is Strange: Welcome to Blackwell Academy\", a book about Blackwell Academy written by Matt Forbeck.\n\n"}

He became a popular performer of lusty seaside songs and originated the J. Glover-Kind classic, \"I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside\" in 1909. He recorded over fifty songs during a ten-year period, including \"One of the Bhoys\" (1910), \"Belgium Put the Kibosh on the Kaiser\" (1914) and \"I'd Like to Shake Shakespeare\" (1915). He was also a major presence in pantomime productions throughout the British Isles during his later career.\n\nBorn in Hendon, County Durham, he initially worked on the Sunderland docks before being employed at the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Theatre, where he took up amateur dramatics. To progress his stage career, he secured engagements in Europe and South Africa in 1890, and performed in Australia two years later. In 1895 he returned to London and entered the vibrant scene of English music hall and became a leading performer on the circuit. In 1909 he first performed what was to become his most famous song \"I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside\", which he later recorded.\n\nIn 1917 Sheridan wrote and composed the musical burlesque, \"Gay Paree\", which he performed with a London theatre company and later toured the northern provinces including Scotland. His career took a decline in later years and he suffered severe depression, as a result. He committed suicide in Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow in 1918 aged 53.\n\nSheridan was born Frederick Shaw to Scottish-Irish parents in Hendon, County Durham and began working with his father, a sail maker, on the Sunderland docks. He progressed from there to working in the back offices of the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Theatre for four years between 1877–1881. There, he became interested in performing and took up amateur dramatics. Sheridan decided to shorten his name to Fred as was a popular name on the music hall circuit. He later changed his name again when he moved from amateur dramatics to the professional theatre and decided upon Mark Sheridan. He took the first name from the American writer and humorist Mark Twain and used his Irish mother's maiden surname, Sheridan.\n\nHis early experiences in variety shows were mainly in Europe, followed by performances in South Africa in 1890, where he went after his marriage to Ethel Maude Davenport. Two years later, he travelled to Australia and appeared on the Harry Rickards circuit, where he started a double act with his wife called \"The Sheridans\". He arrived back in London with his wife in 1895 but dissolved the double act with her. He was engaged to appear at the Standard Music Hall, Pimlico, the same year. From there he became a regular on the London music hall circuit, and quickly built up a reputation as one of the most popular music hall comedians of the time. Sheridan made frequent appearances on the same bill as Marie Lloyd, Little Tich, Dan Leno and George Robey. As well as his comedy sketches, he became a successful singer and enjoyed his biggest success in 1909 with \"I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside\". This led to performances as a principal boy in countless pantomimes across the country and further recordings, including \"One of the Bhoys\" (1910), \"Belgium Put the Kibosh on the Kaiser\" (1914), \"Here We Are Again\" (1914) and \"I'd Like to Shake Shakespeare\" (1915).\n\nIn 1915, Sheridan starred in the comic revue \"Winkles\", which later toured the northern provinces. As music hall was on the decline with audiences, Sheridan concentrated on revue. During his later years, he believed that his popularity was waning and was plagued by deep insecurities and depression.\n\nIn 1917, Sheridan returned to Glasgow where he had enjoyed some of his earliest successes. He wrote and personally financed \"Gay Paree\", a musical burlesque show based on W. G. Wills West End favourite, \"A Royal Divorce\". It cost Sheridan £2,000 and had a London company of 40 people, including two of his children, Billy and Fred. On 14 January 1918, \"Gay Paree\" opened at the Coliseum in Glasgow, in which Sheridan played the part of Napoleon. \"Gay Paree\" received negative reviews from both its audiences and newspaper critics. Sheridan's performance was considered by critics to be less successful than his earlier music hall performances.\n\nDevastated by the critics' reviews, Sheridan walked out of the theatre and the following day, was found dead in nearby Kelvingrove Park, from a single gunshot wound to the head. The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide, since the gun found had belonged to Sheridan. He was buried in Cathcart Cemetery on 18 January 1918, leaving his wife Maude, their three sons Billy, Fred and Jack, and two daughters Francis and Freda.\n\n\n"}

His older brother Jack Carey was a trombone player and bandleader; Mutt was playing cornet in his brother's band by about 1912. Carey toured the vaudeville circuits in 1917.

In real life, the field office is based at the nearby Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling while the Navy Yard is home to the museum and several military commands within the Department of the Navy. It is described by the actors and producers (on special features on DVD releases in the United States) as being distinguished by its comedic elements, ensemble acting, and character-driven plots. The NCIS is the primary law enforcement and counterintelligence arm of the United States Department of the Navy, which includes the United States Marine Corps.

These clips are shown at the beginning of every segment depicting the last two seconds of that segment, a segment being the five or six portions of the show meant to be separated by commercials. In the season-three premiere, \"Kill Ari (Part I)\", a freeze-frame shot was also used with the very end of most episodes turned into a freeze frame, as well.\n\nIt was reported in May 2007 that Donald Bellisario would be stepping down from the show. Due to a disagreement with series star Mark Harmon, Bellisario's duties as showrunner/head writer were to be given to long-time show collaborators, including co-executive producer Chas. Floyd Johnson and Shane Brennan, with Bellisario retaining his title as executive producer. In fall 2009, Gary Glasberg joined the crew and became the new \"day-to-day\" runner of \"NCIS\", as Shane Brennan had to focus on his new show, the spin-off \"\".

In Germany (Region 2), seasons 1–4 and 5–8 were released in two separate sets for each season. The first-season DVD omits the two introductory episodes from season eight of \"JAG\", though they are featured on the \"JAG\" season-eight DVD.\n\nIn 2010, CBS Interactive and GameHouse released a mobile video game, \"NCIS: The Game\" for iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, and BREW/J2ME. The game features five different cases written by the show's writers.\n\nOn November 1, 2011, Ubisoft released a video game adaption of\" NCIS\" for the PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii. A Nintendo 3DS version was released on March 6, 2012.

The backdoor pilot introduced Chris O'Donnell as Special Agent G. Callen, LL Cool J as Special Agent Sam Hanna, Louise Lombard as Special Agent Lara Macy, Peter Cambor as Operational Psychologist Nate Getz: and Daniela Ruah as Special Agent Kensi Blye. The crew for the series includes Michael B. Kaplan, Lev L. Spiro, Jerry London, Sheldon Epps, and Mark Saraceni.\n\nFollowing the show's official pick-up by CBS, it was confirmed that Louise Lombard had not been signed to continue her role as Special Agent Lara Macy. Linda Hunt and Adam Jamal Craig were confirmed to replace her in starring roles, playing OSP Manager Henrietta Lange and Special Agent Dom Vail respectively. Craig, who left the series in episode 21 of season 1, was replaced by Eric Christian Olsen playing Marty Deeks.\n\nCharacters from \"NCIS\" have appeared in the spin-off. Rocky Carroll portrayed Leon Vance in a recurring role, while Pauley Perrette portrayed Abby Sciuto and appeared in the season 1 episodes \"Killshot\" and \"\".\n\n\"NCIS: Los Angeles\" was created by Shane Brennan. In April 2011, \"NCIS\" creator Donald Bellisario sued CBS over \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" because of his contract which gave him \"first opportunity\" to develop a spin-off or sequel, the lawsuit was dismissed by a judge in June 2012. However, discussions continued between CBS and Bellisario and in January 2013 the dispute was settled outside of court a week before it was set to go to trial; the terms of the agreement were not disclosed but were described as being amicable.\n\nIn September 2013 CBS announced a planned second spin-off series set in New Orleans that would be introduced via a planted two-part backdoor pilot \"NCIS\" episode. The episodes were filmed in February 2014 and aired on March 25, 2014, and April 1, 2014. \"NCIS\" star Mark Harmon and showrunner Gary Glasberg are the executive producers, and CBS Studios produces the series. \"Crescent City\", the two-part backdoor-pilot episode was initially \"supposed to be just an idea for an episode\". Glasberg discussed the idea of the episode with Harmon, who said \"That's more than a[n] [...] episode\". The premise for the episodes are, according to Glasberg, \"all about this tiny little NCIS office that's down [in New Orleans], and the kind of cases that they come across\".\n\nThe series stars Scott Bakula as Special Agent Dwayne Cassius Pride, Lucas Black as Special Agent Christopher LaSalle, Zoe McLellan as Special Agent Meredith \"Merri\" Brody, Rob Kerkovich as Sebastian Lund, and CCH Pounder as Dr. Loretta Wade. Daryl \"Chill\" Mitchell, Shalita Grant and Vanessa Ferlito joined the main cast later, portraying computer specialist Patton Plame, Special Agent Sonja Percy, and Special Agent Tammy Gregorio, respectively.\n\nOn May 9, 2014, \"NCIS: New Orleans\" was picked up by CBS and was renewed for a second season on January 12, 2015.\n\n\"NCIS\" and \"NCIS: New Orleans\" have had two crossovers.\n\n\"NCIS\" has received many awards and nominations since it premiered on September 23, 2003, including the ALMA Awards, ASCAP Awards, BMI Film & TV Awards, Emmy Awards, and People's Choice Awards.\n\n"}
{"id": "38490983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38490983", "title": "Number (music)", "text": "Number (music)\n\nIn music, number refers to an individual song, dance, or instrumental piece which is part of a larger work of musical theatre, opera, or oratorio. It can also refer either to an individual song in a published collection or an individual song or dance in a performance of several unrelated musical pieces as in concerts and revues. Both meanings of the term have been used in American English since the second half of the 19th century.\n\nIn musical theatre, the lyrics of the individual song numbers are integrated with the narrative of the libretto (or \"book\"). As early as 1917, Jerome Kern wrote that \"musical numbers should carry on the action of the play, and should be representative of the personalities of the characters who sing them.\" The lyricist Oscar Hammerstein, another proponent of this view, even refused to list the numbers in \"Rose-Marie\" because he thought it would detract from what he viewed as the close integration between the book and the lyrics. However, both David Horn and Scott McMillin have proposed that full integration is not completely possible. For McMillin, the start of a musical number creates a noticeably different \"feel\" in which the singer becomes a \"performer\" not simply a character. For Horn, the individual numbers can serve not only to advance the narrative but also to directly address and engage the audience in an experience which stands apart from the dramatic context of the work., and this latter function had its roots in vaudeville entertainments. In revues, a type of multi-act popular theatrical entertainment that combines music, dance and sketches, there is no overall narrative, but rather a sequence of unrelated (often lavish) musical numbers. However, as Rick Altman points out, some of the numbers in these types of shows such \"This Heart of Mine\" in the film \"Ziegfeld Follies\" can be narratives in miniature. That number, according to Altman, \"is not just musical—its dream-like dance grows out of the Bremer/Astaire <nowiki>[</nowiki>Lucille Bremer and Fred Astaire<nowiki>]</nowiki> mimed narrative which opens the selection.\"\n\nOpera numbers may be arias, but also ensemble pieces, such as duets, trios, quartets, quintets, sextets or choruses. They may also be ballets and instrumental pieces, such as marches, sinfonias, or intermezzi. Until the mid-19th century most operas were structured as a series of discrete numbers connected by recitative or spoken dialogue. Oratorios followed a similar model. However, as the century progressed, numbers were increasingly unified into larger musical segments with no clear break between them. Early examples of this trend include Carl Maria von Weber's opera \"Euryanthe\" and Robert Schumann's secular oratorio \"Das Paradies und die Peri\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "661989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=661989", "title": "Pay television", "text": "Pay television\n\nPay television or subscription television are subscription-based television services, usually provided by both analog and digital cable and satellite television, but also increasingly via digital terrestrial and internet television. Subscription television began in the multi-channel transition and transitioned into the post-network era. Some parts of the world, notably in France and the United States, have also offered encrypted analog terrestrial signals available for subscription.\n\nSubscription-based or pay television has resulted in a change in what type of content is broadcast by these networks. This model has led to networks creating much more specialized types of shows to get viewers to subscribe. Subscription networks are most concerned with providing content that will make people want to subscribe as well as renew subscriptions rather than who is watching and when this viewing is taking place.\n\nDue to the unedited nature of premium services, it is typical for them to showcase programming that includes large amounts of profanity, sexual activity, nudity, graphic violence and other adult content (the inclusion of any such content depends on the program, as services may also include content that is at least partially, if not entirely, devoid of material that may be inappropriate for some viewers). To notify viewers of program content, most premium channels air advisory bumpers immediately before each program, mentioning the program's rating (this typically does not apply to live sporting events) and program content information. Since the 1990s, premium channels in the United States use content descriptors that describe potentially objectionable content included in the program, such as mild violence (identified as \"MV\") or strong sexual content (identified as \"SSC\"); additional features included in the television program such as closed captioning and surround sound functions, and alternate-language audio tracks via secondary audio program feeds may also be mentioned.\n\nMovies comprise much of the programming content seen on most pay television services, particularly those with a general entertainment format and those that focus exclusively on films; films that are broadcast on most premium channels air in their original theatrically-released (and in some cases, unrated home video or DVD) versions; this is in comparison to films aired on terrestrial television or basic cable, which may be subject to edits for time and/or content, depending on what content a jurisdiction allows to be shown over-the-air or on basic cable. Many pay television services obtain rights to films through exclusive agreements with film distributors (this did not become the norm in the U.S. until the mid-1980s, as it would be common for the same film to be broadcast on unrelated pay services during its term of license); films acquired during the original term of license agreements with a distributor may also be broadcast as \"sub-runs,\" in which a service holds rights to film long after the conclusion of a distribution agreement (under this arrangement, the pay service that originally licensed the rights to a particular film title, or one other than that which had held rights, may hold the broadcast rights through a library content deal).\n\nMany general interest premium channels also produce original television series, which feature content that in some jurisdictions may be edgier – and therefore, often more risque – than such programs seen on broadcast networks; many of these series (such as HBO's \"The Sopranos\" and \"Sex and the City\", and Showtime's \"Dexter\") have gone on to achieve viewer, critical and accolade success, though they are subject to a lower audience ratings threshold to be considered a hit than programs on broadcast television because these channels are subscription-based and therefore only appear in a fraction of homes with at least one television set. Some premium channels also broadcast television specials, which most commonly consist of concert events, documentary films and stand-up comedy acts, and in the past, have also included theatrical plays.\n\nSports programming is also featured on some premium services, in particular HBO and Showtime in the United States are both notable for their carriage of boxing events, while Showtime and Epix also carry mixed martial arts events; some general interest premium channels have aired other professional sporting events in the past: HBO for example, has carried games from the National Hockey League (NHL), National Basketball Association (NBA) and American Basketball Association (ABA) in its early years, and from 1975 to 1999 aired the Wimbledon tennis tournament. Specialty pay sports channels such as Setanta Sports and Fox Soccer Plus exist, and are typically sold at a higher expense than traditional premium services; out-of-market sports packages in North America are multi-channel pay services carrying professional or collegiate sporting events which are sold in a seasonal package – these are typically the most expensive type of pay services, generally running in the range of $35 to $50 per month.\n\nSome pay services also offer pornographic films; a few mainstream services (such as Cinemax in the U.S. and The Movie Network's MExcess in Canada) carry a limited amount of softcore content during late night time periods. Specialized channels dedicated to pornographic films also exist that carry either softcore adult programs (such as Playboy TV) or more hardcore content (such as The Erotic Network and Hustler TV), these channels are often sold on a night-by-night basis similar to the pay-per-view model, even though they commonly operate as 24-hour channels.\n\nPremium television services are commonly devoid of traditional commercial advertising, therefore programs on most pay television channels are uninterrupted by television commercials within the broadcast; instead, breaks are inserted between programs, which typically advertise promotions for upcoming programs and feature special behind-the-scenes interstitials (this is the main reason why most subscription television channels are able to run programs without any editing, as they are not subject to pressure from advertisers to tone down content); some sports-based pay services, however, may feature some commercial advertising, particularly if they simulcast sporting events that are broadcast by advertiser-supported television networks. In addition, most general interest or movie-based pay services do not adhere to the common top and bottom of the hour scheduling of other cable channels and terrestrial broadcasters. As such, programs often air using either conventional scheduling or have airtimes in five-minute increments (for example, 7:05 a.m. or 4:40 p.m.); since such channels broadcast content without in-program break interruptions, this sometimes leads to extended or abbreviated breaks between programs, depending on when the previous program concludes and when the start time of the next program is. The only universal variation to this is prime time, where the main channel in each pay service's suite usually schedules films to start at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. ET/PT on the hour.\n\nPay television channels come in different price ranges. Many channels carrying advertising combine this income with a lower subscription fee. These are called \"mini-pay\" channels (a term also used for smaller scale commercial-free pay television services) and are often sold as a part of a package with numerous similarly priced channels. Usually, however, the regular pricing for premium channels ranges from just under $10 to near $25 per month per suite, with lower prices available via bundling options with cable or satellite providers, or special limited offers which are available during free preview periods or before the launch of a network's prestige series. However, some other channels, such as sports and adult networks may ask for monthly pricing that may go as high as near $50 a month. There are also premium television services which are priced significantly higher than the mini-pay channels, but they compensate for their higher price by carrying little or no advertising and also providing a higher quality program output. As advertising sales are sensitive to the business cycle, some broadcasters try to balance them with more stable income from subscriptions.\n\nSome providers offer channels owned by the same company in a single package. For example, American satellite provider DirecTV offers the Encore channels along with the Starz multiplex (both owned by Starz Inc.) in its \"Starz Super Pack\"; and The Movie Channel, Flix and SundanceTV (the latter of which continues to be sold in the DirecTV package despite Showtime Networks no longer owning Sundance, that channel is now owned by AMC Networks) along with Showtime in its \"Showtime Unlimited\" package; Cinemax and its multiplex networks, in turn, are almost always packaged with HBO (both owned by Time Warner). Many pay television services offer multiplex services that are also sold with the main channel, which broadcast a different schedule from that of the service's main channel and often use separate formats focused on genre-based programming (for example; one channel may feature family-oriented programming, another may feature action films) or programming aimed at a specific target audience. In Canada, HBO Canada is packaged with two separate pay services: The Movie Network and Movie Central (as the two services are territorially restricted by choice to respectively serve Eastern Canada and Western Canada; the owners of both channels, Bell Media and Corus Entertainment, each own the territorial rights to HBO Canada in their respective areas).\n\nThough selling premium services that are related by ownership as a package is common, that may not always be the situation: for example, Canada's Family Channel was generally sold independently from The Movie Network and The Movie Network Encore while all were under common ownership (all three networks were owned by Astral Media until that company's 2013 merger with Bell Media; Family – which unlike the TMN channels, is distributed throughout the country – is now owned by DHX Media); The Movie Network Encore is also sold separately from The Movie Network (which spun off the channel in 1994 as TMN Moviepix) by some cable and satellite providers in Eastern Canada, though other providers offer both networks and their multiplex channels as a package. In the United States, Cinemax and Encore are optionally sold separately from or in a single package with their respective parent networks HBO and Starz, depending on the service provider. The Movie Channel and Flix meanwhile, are usually sold together with Showtime (all three channels are owned by CBS Corporation); though subscribers are required to purchase Showtime in order to receive Flix, The Movie Channel does not have such a restriction as a few providers optionally sell that service without requiring a Showtime subscription.\n\nUnlike other cable networks, premium services are almost always subscribed to \"a la carte cable television\", meaning that one can, for example, subscribe to HBO without subscribing to Showtime (in Canada, there are slight modifications, as most providers include U.S. superstations – such as WGN-TV, KTLA and WPCH-TV – with their main premium package by default). However, subscribing to an \"individual\" service automatically includes access to all of that service's available multiplex channels and, in some cases, access to content via video-on-demand (in the form of a conventional VOD television service, and in some cases, a companion on-demand streaming service as well). Most pay television providers also offer a selection of premium services (for example, the HBO, Showtime and Starz packages) in one bundle at a greatly reduced price than it would cost to purchase each service separately, as an inducement for subscribers to remain with their service provider or for others to induce subscribers into using their service. Similarly, many television providers offer general interest or movie-based premium channels at no additional charge for a trial period (loften one to three months, though there have been rare instances of free trials for pay services that last up to one year limited Tv for newer subscribers to that provider's television service.\n\nPay television has become popular with cable and satellite television. Pay television services often, at least two to three times per year, provide free previews of their services, in order to court potential subscribers by allowing this wider audience to sample the service for a period of days or weeks; these are typically scheduled to showcase major special event programming, such as the pay cable premiere of a blockbuster feature film, the premiere (either a series or season premiere) of a widely anticipated or critically acclaimed original series or occasionally, a high-profile special (such as a concert).\n\nSubscription services transmitted via analogue terrestrial television have also existed, to varying degrees of success. Canal+ operated a national analogue terrestrial pay channel in France from 1984 until the 2011 closedown of analogue television, when it transitioned to digital with the other terrestrial analogue channels. Its Spanish counterpart, Canal+ Spain, also broadcast nationally between 1990 and 2005. Some U.S. television stations launched pay services (known simply as \"subscription television\" services) such as SuperTV, Wometco Home Theater, PRISM (which principally operated as a cable service, only being simultaneously carried over-the-air for a short time during the 1980s, and unlike other general-interest pay services accepted outside advertising for broadcast during its sports telecasts), Preview, SelecTV and ONTV in the late 1970s, but those services disappeared as competition from cable television expanded during the 1980s.\n\nIn some countries, the launch of digital terrestrial television has meant that pay television has become increasingly popular in countries with regular antennas. Conversely, even as cordcutting by pay television subscribers due to price increases resulting from rising carriage fees and as the use of digital multicasting by terrestrial broadcasters has increased since the late 2000s, there have not been any attempts to launch new over-the-air pay services in North America.\n\nIn Australia, Foxtel, Optus Television and TransACT are the major pay television distributors, all of which provide cable services in some metropolitan areas, with Foxtel providing satellite service for all other areas where cable is not available. Austar formerly operated as a satellite pay service, until it merged with Foxtel and SelecTV. The major distributors of pay television in New Zealand are Sky Network Television on satellite and Vodafone on cable.\n\nSince the late 2000s, internet video services which distribute original and acquired movies and television shows (including Netflix, Amazon Video and Hulu Plus) have become major competitors to pay television channels, offering very similar programming content.\n\nPay-per-view (PPV) services are similar to subscription-based pay television services in that customers must pay to have the broadcast decrypted for viewing, but usually only entail a one-time payment for a single or time-limited viewing. Programs offered via pay-per-view are most often movies or sporting events, but may also include other events, such as concerts and even softcore adult programs. In the U.S., the initial concept and technology for pay-per-view for broadcast television was first developed in the early 1950s, including a crude decrypting of the over-the-air television signal and a decoding box, but never caught on for use at that time. It took another four decades when cable broadcasters started using pay-per-view on a widespread basis.\n\n\"Free\" variants are free-to-air (FTA) and free-to-view (FTV); however, FTV services are normally encrypted and decryption cards either come as part of an initial subscription to a pay television bouquet – in other words, an offer of pay-TV channels – or can be purchased for a one-time cost. FTA and FTV systems may still have selective access. Australia Plus is one example, as much of its programming content is free-to-air except for National Rugby League (NRL) games, which are encrypted.\n\n"}

Apple cited violations of their developer guidelines as the reason for removing the game, though an article published in \"The Guardian\" questioned the validity of their concerns. Following the removal of the game, it was released for Android phones, and a free playable Adobe Flash version was made available on the developer's website.\n\nThe \"Phone Story\" website contains extensive information about the topics touched on by the game, and all profits from the sale of the app go to charities which work in the areas described, including a donation of over $6000 to a girl injured in a suicide attempt at a Foxconn factory.\n\nThe game is offered as freeware under a Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-SA.\n\n\"Phone Story\" consists of four self-contained minigames, each featuring narration by a voice which represents the user's phone, detailing the real world conditions which the minigames represent. The first game deals with the mining of coltan in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and has the player controlling guards to ensure that labourers are not allowed to rest. The second takes place at a factory, in which the player must move a net back and forth in order to catch workers who are attempting suicide. The third is set in a phone store, in which the player must slingshot phones into the hands of consumers. The final minigame concerns the recycling of discarded phones in Ghana, tasking the player with dividing components from the phone among workers that are salvaging the parts in unsafe ways. Each minigame requires the player to complete the relevant action successfully a certain number of times before a timer runs out; if they do not, the narrator admonishes them, saying \"do not pretend that you are not complicit.\"\n\n\"Phone Story\" has received mixed reviews. \"Android Rundown\" said that it was \"not that entertaining or enlightening\", criticising the game's short length and repetitive gameplay and awarding it 5 points out of 10. \"Pocket Gamer\" were more positive in reference to the game's educational content, stating that it encouraged them to read up on the issues raised, but were similarly critical with the game's simplistic gameplay and short length.\n"}

A pitch is used throughout different stages of production, such as casting and distribution, as well as to urge film producers to further fund a project. Filmmakers who devise a pitch tend to manufacture a production package, which is handed out to each potential investor during the pitch. The package contains the basic information for the filmmaker's project, such as a plot synopsis and budgeting values. Sometimes, filmmakers will produce an independent pitch trailer as a part of the package to help potential financiers better visualize the project and the filmmaker's vision.\n\nThough pitches are usually made on the basis of a full script or teleplay, animated productions for both film and television are often pitched on the basis of storyboards alone. For example, the animated television show \"Phineas and Ferb\" was pitched from a storyboard. Co-founders of the project, Dan Povenmire and Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh, needed to convince overseas executives for The Walt Disney Company to greenlight the series, so they drew a storyboard and recorded it as a reel. They then mixed it and dubbed it over with sound effects, voices, and narrative, then sent the recording to the executives, who accepted it.\n\nTelevision pitches can also be devised by the network or company that produces the program. Certain networks are pitched the idea of including a character in a series in order to boost ratings. Such pitches have been used with \"Oliver\" in \"The Brady Bunch\" and \"Luke\" on \"Growing Pains\". Networks also try to force their ideas on series' producers through their pitches, though their approach is business-oriented and their ideas are generally not favored by writers and viewers. In 1992, the crew of the animated series \"Rugrats\" was approached by Nickelodeon, which pitched the idea of a \"Rugrats\" Hanukkah special. Paul Germain, co-creator of the series, responded by suggesting a passover special, which he dubbed a \"funny idea.\" After they closed production for that special, they began considering the Hanukkah special and eventually created it in 1996 as the episode \"A Rugrats Chanukah.\"\n\n"}

In 1795 the Russian population was 37 million, of whom the vast majority were serfs, owned by a mere 360,000 male nobles. The average aristocrat owned just 60 serfs and only 11 per cent owned more than 1000 .\n\nIn the late eighteenth century it became popular to employ serfs to mount productions of operas, ballets or plays. More than 2,000 of these slave-artists performed in more than 170 noble theaters and were bought and sold wholesale while at the same time becoming stars. For example, Prince Potemkin bought the whole serf orchestra of Count Kyril Razumovsky for 40,000 rubles. As the popularity of drama grew in Russia, competition developed between the nobles as to who could host the most impressive performances.\n\nWhile the majority of nobles owned less than a thousand serfs, the wealthiest individuals owned many more. Nicholai Sheremetev, for instance, owned 210,000 serfs. His son, Peter Sheremetev, was fascinated by the theater and invested in his company. Upon gaining control of the estate, Peter Sheremetev built a theatre company widely recognized during Russia’s golden age of nobility. Sheremetev fell in love with his star singer and actress whose stage name was “Pearl.” In 1801 Count Nicholas Sheremetev, aged 50 and the richest man in Russia, secretly married 32-year-old Praskovia Kovalyova in a ceremony that shocked the Tsar and all of the nation's aristocrats. Sheremetev’s love for theatre was exhibited by his long-term relationship with Kovalyova as well as the high professional quality of his theatre. By the early nineteenth century, there 170 serf theatres varying greatly in size and quality.\n\nSerf theatre companies provided the basis of public theatres in several Russian towns.\n\n"}
{"id": "35987069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35987069", "title": "Sandra and Woo", "text": "Sandra and Woo\n\nSandra and Woo is a comedy webcomic written by a German author, Oliver Knörzer, and drawn by an Indonesian artist, Puri \"Powree\" Andini. It is published in English and German. The first strip was put online on 19 October 2008 and the black-and-white comic strip has been updated twice a week since then. As of 6 November 2018, 1031 strips have been published. From strip #307, published on 12 September 2011, to strip #398, published on 30 July 2012, the comic was colored by the American artist Lisa Moore. She also colored selected strips from the strip archive during this time. The 1000th \"Sandra and Woo\" strip was posted on 1 July 2018. A Kickstarter was announced on 7 November 2018 for a printed anthology of the first 1031 strips published already, and a second book containing art based on the comic.\n\nThe main characters of the comic strip are the 13-year-old girl Sandra North and her pet raccoon Woo. Sandra lives together with her single father Richard in an unnamed town in the north of the United States. Woo is able to speak, but only talks with Sandra since he’s afraid to end up in a laboratory otherwise. Woo is a quite mischievous raccoon, so Sandra occasionally gets in trouble as a result of Woo’s misbehavior.\n\nSandra's boyfriend Cloud Williams and Sandra's best friend Larisa Korolev have appeared almost as often as Woo in the webcomic since 2010. Cloud is the son of two fanatic \"Final Fantasy\" fans, David and Ye Thuza, who named him after \"Final Fantasy VII\"’s hero Cloud Strife. They also have a younger daughter, named Yuna after the \"Final Fantasy X\" protagonist. Cloud gets trained in sword-fighting and combat by his Burmese mother Ye Thuza, who was a rebel in her home country before coming to America. Larisa is a free spirit who doesn’t think too much about the consequences of her actions. She’s a casual pyromaniac and the only thing she loves more than fire is probably smooching with boys. In strip #718 it was revealed that she was born with Wolfram syndrome, which means she has a lifespan of about 30 years, giving us some insight of her aggressive determination to live while she can.\n\nOther recurring characters include Woo's love interest Lily, the fox Shadow and the red squirrel Sid, who live in the large forest near Sandra’s house. Shadow and Sid met as kits when they were raised by the same wildlife rehabber. As indicated by the webcomic's tagline, \"a webcomic about friendship, life and the art of (not) eating squirrels\", it is a running gag in the webcomic that Woo, Shadow and other carnivores regularly try to eat Sid, but fail in the end.\n\n\"Sandra and Woo\" received positive reviews from most critics. Brigid Alverson from \"Comic Book Resources\" noted that \"it includes a bit of bad language and a few references to serious subjects, but the cute animals and the clean artwork have plenty of kid-appeal.\" In issue 06/2010 of the Russian game magazine \"Game Land\", the reviewer pointed out that comic readers would enjoy the references to other comics found in \"Sandra and Woo\". Jaron Hataway of \"The Dallas Morning News\"' \"Pop Culture Blog\" found that Andini's art style makes it easy to understand the course of action and that Knörzer understands the \"interwoven feelings of tween-aged girls.\" Criticising that the dialog \"can sometimes be a little off,\" he gave it a rating of 9/10 and concluded that \"the characters are wonderfully crafted and the art is delightful.\" Other critics were reminded of Bill Watterson’s \"Calvin and Hobbes\", which is also given as the main influence by the webcomic author, because of the similar style of humor.\n\n\"Sandra and Woo\" was nominated three times for the category \"Best Anthropomorphic Comic Strip\" at the 2010, 2011, and 2012 Ursa Major Awards, for the category “Best Black and White Art” at \"The Webcomic List Awards\" 2010, and was given a \"Webcomic Beaky Award\" as one of the three best new webcomics of 2008. In March 2013, \"Sandra and Woo\" reached the final round of the \"ComicMix Webcomic Tournament 2013\", a single-elimination tournament based on votes and donations between 128 of the most popular webcomics.\n\n\"Sandra and Woo\" was also the topic of two journal articles by linguist Jun.-Prof. Dr. Ulrike Preußer from the University of Duisburg-Essen published in German teaching magazines. Taking an in-depth look at the German versions of the strips \"A Sly Raccoon\" and \"The Forbidden Fruit\", Preußer discusses how teachers can use comic strips such as those to generate literary interest in grade schoolers. The German version of the strip \"Test Of Friendship\" was included in \"Freiräume – Evangelisches Religionsbuch für Mittelschulen\", a Protestant religious schoolbook for German middle schools.\n\n\"Sandra and Woo\" was also featured in two scientific papers written by the computer scientists Philip Buchanan, Bachelor of Engineering at the University of Canterbury, Michael Doggett, Associate Professor at Lund University, and Ramakrishnan Mukundan, Associate Professor at the University of Canterbury. Using artwork from various \"Sandra and Woo\" strips, they presented a new automatic algorithm for extracting properties of an individual artist’s style and applying those properties to other drawings.\n\nFor the 500th strip, entitled \"The Book of Woo\" and published on 29 July 2013, Knörzer and Andini created four illustrated pages inspired by the Voynich manuscript. All four pages show strange illustrations next to a cipher text. The strip was mentioned in MTV Geek and discussed in the \"Cipher Mysteries\" blog of cryptology expert Nick Pelling as well as \"Klausis Krypto Kolumne\" of cryptology expert Klaus Schmeh. \"The Book of Woo\" was also discussed on several pages of Craig P. Bauer's book \"Unsolved!\" about the history of famous ciphers. As part of the lead-up to the 1000th strip, Knörzer posted the original English text on 28 June 2018. The crucial obfuscation step was the translation of the English plain text into the constructed language Toki Poni by Matthew Martin.\n\nIn summer 2012, the German PC game developer Feline Fuelled Games began the development of an adventure game called Sandra and Woo in the Cursed Adventure featuring all the main characters from \"Sandra and Woo\". On 30 April 2015, the first screenshots of the game were uploaded to the webcomic's website. The game was eventually released on Steam on 5 May 2017 to mixed reviews from video game critics. In his review for \"Adventure Gamers\" (3.5/5 stars), Peter Mattsson was fond of the likeable characters and the interesting story, but criticized the design of some of the puzzles and minigames. Susanne Lang-Vorhofer from the German website \"Adventure Corner\" also liked the characters and the story, but had a very negative opinion about the German voice-over, giving the game a score of 68% in the end.\n\nSince 19 November 2011, the \"Sandra and Woo\" website also hosts Knörzer and Andini's fantasy webcomic Gaia, which follows the adventures of several graduates of an elite academy after a deadly attack during graduation ball. \"Gaia\" is based on a story which was originally developed by Feline Fuelled Games for a cancelled campaign mod for the PC game \"Neverwinter Nights 2\". \"Gaia\" is updated twice a week with full color pages. As of 12 July 2018, 673 pages have been published, including 7 cover pages.\n\n"}
{"id": "21859783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21859783", "title": "Shangani Patrol (film)", "text": "Shangani Patrol (film)\n\nShangani Patrol is a war film based upon the non-fiction book \"A Time to Die\" by Robert Cary (1968), and the historical accounts of the Shangani Patrol, with Brian O'Shaughnessy as Major Allan Wilson and Will Hutchins as the lead Scout Frederick Russell Burnham. Also includes the song \"Shangani Patrol\" by Nick Taylor (1966 recording).\n\nUnder the command of Major Wilson, the patrol tracks the fleeing Ndebele King Lobengula across the Shangani River. Cut off from the main force, they are ambushed by the Ndebele impi and, except for the few men sent as reinforcements, all are killed. Such was the bravery of the Shangani Patrol that the victorious Ndebele said, \"They were men of men and their fathers were men before them.\" Depending on one's viewpoint, this event was one of the great mistakes and military blunders of this time in history, or the last heroic stand of a gallant few. The incident had lasting significance in England, South Africa, and Rhodesia as the equivalent of 'Custer's Last Stand'. This is their story, told in a 1970 film shot on location in Matabeleland, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).\n\nLocale, Mashonaland, Southern Rhodesia, 1893. The British South Africa Company (BSAC) (later to become the British South African Police - BSAP) is based in the encampment of Fort Salisbury (now the capital of Zimbabwe, Harare). The film starts with a sepia toned trial of two AWOL volunteers and later deserters who were eventually court martialed by the army for stealing gold which was given to them by Matabele warriors on behalf of King Lobengula as a peace offering to end the war. In this trial (which is solely represented by archive drawings and voice-overs) the voice of TV anchor man/journalist Adrian Steed is heard as the judge (later to be seen as Major Forbes) and that of Stuart Brown playing Dr Leander Starr Jameson. \n\nThe film then cuts to a glorious sunset shot of Southern Rhodesia where the camp is situated. After a sentimental encounter between the leader Allan Wilson and his wife May, in which Wilson professes the fervent wish to procreate with his wife in order to produce pioneer Rhodesians, it cuts to the titles of the film, all based on scenes from the film. The horrific and ultimately unavoidable slaughter of the Patrol is included. Fort Salisbury has a serious problem; it is surrounded by hordes of menacing Matabele warriors, one of whom demands the release of the Shona people under the protection of the BSAC and promises that his warriors will kill them in the bush and not in the Shangani River so as not to dirty the water. \n\nThe BSAC re-group and under orders from Dr. Jameson, are to pursue King Lobengula’s troops all the way down from Fort Salisbury to the south of Rhodesia, at that time the kingdom of Lobengula, to capture King Lobengula and hold him to ransom. Wilson leads his troops on what has become a heroic but ultimately futile quest to capture the King in the hope that his troops will surrender. One by one, the volunteers begin showing signs of their inexperience and sometimes lack of courage. One even loses his nerve, runs away and is shot while fleeing. Eventually, with ammunition and morale running low, Wilson dispatches Burnham back to the fort to alert Major Forbes that reinforcements are required. After much argument, Burnham complies and the Shangani Patrol is minus another volunteer. \n\nBurnham alerts Major Forbes to the peril that the Patrol is in. Forbes refuses to back his troops up. The Patrol is eliminated by the Ndebele after Wilson fires his remaining bullet. He and the party are killed by the Matabele, who then praise the 34 men of the Shangani Patrol as being \"men of men\". \n\nThe final slaughter of the vanquished is shown in quick fire frame flashes (almost like still pictures) and with no sound, right up until the moment when the Matabele induna screams \"Touch not their bodies! They were men of men and their fathers were men before them!\" The last scene is of Burnham visiting the burial and monument to the Shangani Patrol at Matopo Hills.\n\n\"Shangani Patrol\" was the third film made by South African producers David Millin and Roscoe Behrmann under the newly formed RPM Film Studios. The film was shot entirely on location in Rhodesia, in the Marula district, about sixty miles from Bulawayo and not far from the historical battles of the First Matabele War. Shooting was completed in the scheduled six weeks.\n\n"}
{"id": "1481725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1481725", "title": "Soubrette", "text": "Soubrette\n\nA soubrette is a type of operatic soprano voice fach, often cast as a female stock character in opera and theatre. The term arrived in English from Provençal via French, and means \"conceited\" or \"coy\". A soubrette is also defined as a young woman regarded as flirtatious or frivolous.\n\nIn theatre, a soubrette is a comedy character who is vain and girlish, mischievous, lighthearted, coquettish and gossipy—often a chambermaid or confidante of the ingénue, she often displays a flirtatious or even sexually aggressive nature. The soubrette appeared in commedia dell'arte scenarios, often in the role of Columbina, where the actress would provide the details of her behavior and dialogue. From there, she moved to the works of Molière, which were influenced by the Commedia; the role of Dorine in \"Tartuffe\" (1664) fits the description. A famous example, though a hundred years later, is Suzanne in Beaumarchais' \"Le Mariage de Figaro\" (1784).\n\nIn classical music and opera, the term \"soubrette\" refers to both a soprano voice type and a type of opera role. A soubrette voice is light with a bright, sweet timbre, a tessitura in the mid-range, and with no extensive coloratura. A soubrette's vocal range extends approximately from middle C (C) to \"high D\" (D). The voice has a lighter vocal weight than other soprano voices with a brighter timbre. Many young singers start out as soubrettes but as they grow older and the voice matures more physically they may be reclassified as another voice type, usually either a light lyric soprano, a lyric coloratura soprano, or a coloratura mezzo-soprano. Rarely does a singer remain a soubrette throughout her entire career. The tessitura of the soubrette tends to lie a bit lower than the lyric soprano and spinto soprano.\n\nThe soubrette roles are typically found in comic operas or operettas and they usually portray good-looking, youthful girls who are flirtatious, saucy, and street-wise. Typically these roles are sung by younger singers and both sopranos and mezzo-sopranos are cast in them. Many soubrette roles have a considerable amount of spoken German dialogue, and therefore the soubrette singer must possess both an excellent comprehension of the German language and considerable acting skills. It is rare today to find true soubrettes singing in major opera houses as their voices are typically unable to carry over larger orchestras in larger halls. Often lyric, coloratura, and mezzo-sopranos are cast in soubrette roles, especially in the early part of their singing careers. This does not mean that these singers are soubrette sopranos but it does mean they can play soubrette roles. The coloratura soprano has a higher range, can sing more dexterous vocal passages and has a somewhat brighter sound than the soubrette. The lyric soprano has a richer voice and higher range than the soubrette soprano. The mezzo-soprano can sing as high as a soubrette but with a darker timbre and heavier weight in the voice. Mezzos also have a much more extensive range in the lower register. In addition, the beautiful light voice of the soubrette is ideal for baroque music, early music and baroque opera, as well as many art songs. However, the soubrette soprano voice is limited even in this repertoire by its lack of coloratura skill and relatively limited range. Many operettas and musicals include soubrette characters, such as Valencienne in \"The Merry Widow\" and in Gilbert and Sullivan, the Jessie Bond mezzo-soprano roles such as Cousin Hebe (\"H.M.S. Pinafore\") and Lady Angela (\"Patience\"). Another example is the character Ellie Mae Chipley, who sings \"Life Upon the Wicked Stage\" in Kern and Hammerstein's \"Show Boat\".\n\nSource:\n\nNotes\nSources\n"}
{"id": "961949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=961949", "title": "Superstars", "text": "Superstars\n\nSuperstars is an all-around sports competition that pits elite athletes from different sports against one another in a series of athletic events resembling a decathlon. Points are awarded for the position in which the competitor places in each event. The competitor with the most points at the end of all ten events is declared the champion.\n\nOn the original ABC version, an athlete could compete in up to seven events, but no athlete was permitted to compete in the sport(s) of his or her profession. In the World, International, European and British versions of the contest, athletes would compete in 8 out of 10 events, with no one generally allowed to take part in their own sport, although some handicapping rules did apply.\n\nThe idea was developed by 1948 and 1952 Olympic figure skating champion Dick Button. He shopped the idea to all three U.S. television networks, and ABC bought it as a special for the winter of 1973. The first Superstars competition was held in Rotonda West, Florida in March 1973 and was won by pole vaulter Bob Seagren. The BBC covered the competition and aired their own programme, featuring British athletes on 31 December 1973, which was won by 400 metre hurdles Olympic champion David Hemery. Television broadcasts of the competitions were popular both in Europe and North America in the 1970s and 1980s. Further events featuring European athletes started from 1975, with six World Superstars championships taking place from 1977 to 1982.\n\nCompetitors participate in a range of different sporting events, including a 100-yard dash/100m sprint, half mile (800 m) run, obstacle course or steeplechase, weightlifting, soccer skills, rowing, tennis, basketball, bicycle racing, shooting and swimming. The sports have varied over time and between the various national and international competitions; in the first competition there was no obstacle course, but table tennis and baseball hitting were included, while the European versions featured a 600m Steeplechase, indoor cycling on a highly banked velodrome, and the infamous 'Gym Tests'.\n\nCanadian soccer player Brian Budd was unbeaten in Superstars contests, winning the World Championship three times from 1978 to 1980, making him the most successful Superstar of all time.\n\nOriginally aired in the US by ABC in March 1973, Superstars was first broadcast in Britain on 31 December 1973 as \"Britain's Sporting Superstars\", closely following the American format. David Vine, who was the main presenter of the BBC programme from 1973 to 1985, said \"in 1972, Ron Pickering, myself, Don Revie, Billy Bremner and TV producer Barney Colehan sat in a hotel in Leeds and formulated Superstars but the BBC dismissed the idea. Then Dick Button started it in the States and the BBC bought the rights\".\n\nRecorded at Crystal Palace in August and promoted as a challenge between Britain's seven best sportsmen, the contest was won by David Hemery, the 1968 Olympic champion in the 400 metres hurdles, defeating Jackie Stewart, Bobby Moore, Joe Bugner, Roger Taylor, Tony Jacklin and Barry John. Featuring the first ever gym test (devised by Pickering, and comprising circuit running, a medicine ball throw, parallel bar dips and squat thrusts) the event came down to the final steeplechase, where Hemery overcame a 100m handicap to pass Barry John with 60 metres left. Shown on New Year's Eve, the programme was a major success and was repeated the following year.\n\nIn the second event in 1974, World Light-Heavyweight boxing champion John Conteh comfortably beat an ill Hemery and Colin Bell to win the title, again at Crystal Palace. Conteh credited the highly competitive nature of the competition with increasing his abilities as a boxer, the inception of this cross-sport contest quickly encouraged many top athletes to push themselves further, introducing the idea that the winner could claim to be the country's \"top sportsman\" and also provided an arena where recently retired champions (such as Hemery and Lynn Davies) could extend their careers.\n\nFollowing the success of the first two standalone UK competitions, in 1975 the British national Superstars contest was suspended, and the event was widened to include participants from continental Europe. Five preliminary heats were held, followed by a final at the Ahoy indoor arena in Rotterdam, famous for its banked, wooden cycling track. This proved to make Superstars a major hit, achieving large audiences across the continent and paving the way for the International and World Superstars editions to follow.\n\nMemorable events in the first year of European Superstars included Malcolm Macdonald winning the 100m sprint in a Superstars record time of 10.9 seconds (after being made to run the race twice following the false start of another competitor), David Hemery being beaten by Dutch field hockey player Ties Kruize following a fall in the 600m Steeplechase, Swedish Discus thrower Ricky Bruch setting records in the weight lifting and medicine ball throw section of the gym tests and the first appearance of pole vaulter Kjell Isaksson, who dominated the final heat in Sweden, scoring a then record 69 (out of a possible 80) points.\n\nBefore the final in Rotterdam, Kruize was badly injured in a car accident and was replaced by Hemery, who finished second. Kjell Isaksson dominated the event again, winning four of his eight events and finished second or third in three others, winning the title with an event to spare.\n\nThe rules for European Superstars allowed athletes to compete in \"near specialist\" events with a handicap, meaning that both Hemery and Isaksson were allowed to run in the 100m and Steeplechase, but only after giving the other finalists a head start. In the final 600m Steeplechase event Hemery made up a 100m handicap on his rivals in order to finish in overall second, after again falling badly at the water jump and running the last 100m with badly torn ankle ligaments.\n\nIn 1976 national competitions were resumed and Hemery again became UK Superstar, beating Conteh and Formula 1 World Champion James Hunt easily. By now Hemery was a \"professional Superstar\", competing in Britain, Europe and the US, and devising his own training regime. His performances duly improved, and even though 1976 Olympic Judoka David Starbrook took his parallel bar dips record in the gym tests, Hemery had become Britain's top competitor.\n\nIn the Ahoy final, Isaksson won five events and finished 20 points ahead of his nearest rival. The top eight finishers were also guaranteed a place at the inaugural World Superstars competition, to be held in the US the following year.\n\n1977 provided two new champions, with Isaksson taking part only in the World contest and David Hemery competing in American Superstars. In the UK national Superstars, rower Tim Crooks beat future World's Strongest Man Geoff Capes in a tight contest, but failed to qualify for the European final, losing by one point to François Tracanelli in the Spanish heat. Representing Great Britain instead at the Ahoy final was Rugby League player Keith Fielding, who finished a close second, matching Hemery's best ever performance by a British Superstar.\n\nThe winner of 1977 European Superstars was the returning Ties Kruize, who was now fully recovered from his car crash. With just the indoor steeplechase left, Kruize was one point behind Jean-Paul Coche but five ahead of Fielding. With Coche having completed his events Fielding needed to win the final race, with Kruize finishing no better than third. With Fielding already finished (and celebrating) Kruize passed speed skater Hans van Helden on the final straight to win by 2.5 points. An exhausted Fielding then told BBC TV that the loss was \"a damn, bloody shame\", but both qualified for the 1978 World Championship.\n\nThere was no UK national or European Superstars contest in 1978, but both events returned in 1979, along with a new \"Past Masters\" event for competitors over 35, which was won by Lynn Davies, the 1964 Olympic Long Jump champion. 1979 saw the first appearances of judoka Brian Jacks, who became Britain's most famous Superstar. Jacks had enormous upper body strength and quickly came to dominate the gym tests, setting records in squat thrusts and, in particular, the parallel bar dips. In the 1979 UK national final Jacks comprehensively beat the field, and then went on to compete in Rotterdam for the European title.\n\nNo Briton had ever won this title, but Jacks was a strong favourite against defending champion Ties Kruize. Jacks won the gym tests and set a new record time in the cycling. At start of the final event, the steeplechase, Jacks had a small lead, but was out of events. Kruize accumulated enough points in the steeplechase to join Jacks in a tie for first place. With no tie-breaking system in operation both men were crowned European Superstar, making Jacks the most successful British Superstar ever. Jacks succumbed to shingles in late 1979 so was unable to travel to The Bahamas for the World Championship.\n\nSuperstars regularly attracted over 10 million TV viewers in the UK and Jacks became a household name, appearing on children's TV shows and picking up endorsements usually beyond the reach of a minority sport participant. Superstars also expanded again in 1980, adding International Superstars to its list of programmes, though this was as a direct replacement for the European event. Although popular in the UK, US, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands and Australia, Superstars reached its peak at the turn of the decade, and one by one (starting in Europe) the participating nations fell away.\n\nAgainst Jacks in 1980 was Daley Thompson, globally recognised as the top multi-sports athlete after his victory in the 1980 Olympic Games decathlon competition. With Brian Budd in attendance for the UK National final, Brian Jacks took on Thompson, Steve Assinder from Basketball, pentathlete Danny Nightingale and the new \"Past Master\", former 400m hurdler John Sherwood, who won all his events in the heats, setting a new record.\n\nIn the gym tests Jacks scored 80 in the dips and 73 in the squat thrusts, and finished 18 points ahead of Sherwood in second place. Thompson finished third. John Sherwood in finishing in second place gained a place in the World Championships and with it the possibility of big prize money. To ensure that he was able to finish second Sherwood had to turn professional part-way through the competition in order to compete in the 100m (as his status as an amateur track and field athlete would normally have barred him from competing in this event). Although many amateur athletes (most notably Kjell Isaksson) had competed in Superstars since its inception, they had never been able to retain any prize money, with this instead going to their sport. In winning three World Superstar titles, Brian Budd won over $130,000, while Bob Seagren (the first World Champion) won over $200,000.\n\nIn International Superstars in Israel Jacks defeated both of the other European Superstars champions Ties Kruize and Kjell Isaksson, as well as 1980 Tour de France winner Joop Zoetemelk to claim the new title.\n\nFor Sherwood – a PE teacher from Sheffield at this time, and not a full-time sportsman – the World Championship proved to be a success, but not for Jacks, aiming to become the first European to win the title. In The Bahamas both Britons won events: Jacks in the weightlifting and the gym tests—after an epic struggle against Brian Budd—and Sherwood in the cycle race. However, it was Sherwood's two second-places in the football and 800 metres that propelled him into second place, with the cycling coming at Jacks' expense, and winning him $15,000 in the process. He was officially now Britain's best ever Superstar, although he had still finished 26 points behind Budd.\n\nTo start the 1981 season, the BBC decided to invite the most successful British Superstars back for a one-off \"Challenge of the Champions\" programme, featuring all the past winners of the UK National contest, as well as the two \"Past Masters\" and the two men who had won heats of European Superstars. Joining Brian Jacks were David Hemery, Keith Fielding, Lynn Davies, John Conteh, Tim Crooks, Malcolm MacDonald and John Sherwood.\n\nThis was arguably the strongest ever UK Superstars contest, and with so many competitive sportsmen present it was no surprise that records tumbled. Jacks was the heavy favourite, and duly won his 'banker' events, but his inability to compete in the running tests left him facing huge obstacles.\nHis performance in the gym tests was simply astonishing, smashing his own parallel bars record in the starkly lit Wycombe sports centre with an awesome 100 in 54 seconds; had he pushed himself all the way to the minute he could easily have added more. His innovative 'rocking' technique (like Budd's sliding squat thrusts) was widely copied, but none of his rivals could get anywhere near him, and though Sherwood again pushed him close in the squats section, in reality Jacks was in a class of one here.\n\nThe key to winning Superstars had become to gain maximum points in your best events and then to place as highly in the others – simple in theory, but appallingly hard in practice. Jacks usually dominated in the gym and weightlifting, and almost always also won the cycling and canoeing. That gave him a nominal 40 point head start on his rivals, but if this sequence could be disrupted, then Jacks was relying on picking up more points elsewhere. He never competed in the two running events and was a weaker shot that his rivals, so he was then faced with winning the basketball or swimming which were much more equal events. And in the Challenge of the Champions Keith Fielding was able to disrupt Jacks' strategy by enough to beat him.\n\nEarly on Jacks was looking good, beating Fielding in a record time to win the canoeing, but once Fielding had won the cycling Jacks was beaten. Fielding had entered the event hoping to take the Superstars 100m record first and foremost, and then to put up a good showing against Jacks. Now he was the ultimate champion.\n\nThe key had been his ability to score well throughout – he was second in the steeplechase for instance – and even losing his 'banker' (the 100m to David Hemery) was not a problem. By winning the steeplechase in the final event, Lynn Davies was able to push Jacks down into third place, and with injuries forcing the judoka to miss the 1981 British final later that season, this would be an ignominious end to his Superstars story. For Fielding, the forgotten man of 1978, this was a new dawn that he followed up by a second convincing win in the UK final.\n\nSince 1978, the BBC had also produced an equally popular British Superteams event, which was dominated from the start by the \"Athletes\" – a team of Track and Field stars, who won every series but the final one in 1985. From 1979 a stand-out performer in this team was Brian Hooper, a pole-vaulter with an immense will to win. He first came to prominence in the 1979 Superteams final, failing to be able to jump onto a balance beam in the obstacle course event, and by 1982 he had blossomed into a fine, all-round performer.\n\nLeading the 1982 Athletes team to Superteams victory, Hooper was trailed by the BBC as the new challenger to watch in that season's UK final. He was a strong swimmer, almost unbeatable in the canoeing and gym tests, and competitive in all his other events. And then he lost in his heat, to Karate fighter Vic Charles, and his promise seemed lost. However, Charles was unable to compete in the 1982 final, and Hooper was his replacement. He would go on to win his next five straight Superstars events, becoming two time British Superstar, three-time International Superstar, and the 1982 World Superstar Champion. Only Brian Budd has a better record in the competition.\n\nHooper's victory in the 1982 World Championship came at the expense of defending World Champion Jody Scheckter, and American Footballers James Lofton, Cris Collinsworth and Mark Gastineau. Hooper later stated that he felt pressured by the aggressive nature of the US challengers, which came to a head in the final of the bike race, where he found himself boxed in by several rivals all seemingly working in concert to hold him back. Charging through powerfully and fairly, Hooper finished comfortably in the lead, but was then faced with official protests, claiming he either took a short-cut off the track or otherwise acted illegally. He clearly had not, and was quickly declared the legitimate winner. Victories in the rowing and second place in the gym test and swimming saw him win by just 3/4 of a point from talented runner Lofton. He was however 10 3/4 points clear entering the final event (and thus guaranteed to win the title) and coasted through his obstacle course heat. As only the two fastest heat winners ran in the final, Hooper could not add to his tally. Lofton on the other hand had $10000 to fight for, and bested Renaldo Nehemiah in the final event, and duly took second place, something again he was virtually guaranteed before the event.\n\nBy now a professional Superstar (he won $37000 for the 1982 World Championship), Brian Hooper dominated British and International Superstars until he retired in 1984. He beat all of the major British Superstars of his era except Brian Jacks, who had previously retired through injury. Returning to the event age 50 in 2004, Hooper competed ably despite a torn pectoral muscle, finishing fourth against rivals at least 15 years younger than himself. Even now he still won the kayaking and came second in golf, almost making the final, beaten only in the end by an agonising uphill bike race.\n\nThough Brian Hooper continued to compete in (and dominate) Superstars events until he retired in 1984, he stopped competing in the UK national contest after 1983, and he was succeeded as national champion in 1984 by athlete Garry Cook. The 1983 championship was also notable for the record breaking performances of Des Drummond in the 100m, with the agile Leigh Rugby League player managing to lower the mark down to only 10.85 seconds, in itself a time comparable with many full-time track and field athletes who would compete in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The final also saw Hooper beat Vic Charles (the only man ever to finish above him in any Superstars competition at that point).\n\nIn the 1984 final Garry Cook was pushed very close by professional stunt performer and motorcycle racer, Eddie Kidd, but he held on against a weaker field than usual to become champion. Cook also competed in the now more popular \"Superteams\" series, as part of the never-defeated 'Athletes' team, who were only finally beaten during the last season of the show in 1985. By now the BBC had decided that the programme was in need of 'freshening up' and had altered the format several times, changing the format of the gym tests to include bar jumps and adding computerised scoring to stop the trend of sliding squat thrusts. The programme was also moved to Portsmouth and took on a naval theme, adding a field gun competition in a bid to boost flagging ratings. The final series of \"Superteams\" was duly won by 'Watersports' (a team representing swimming, water-skiing and diving) which was led by Olympic swimmer Robin Brew who excelled at running events and also in the gym tests, where the bar jump became his speciality.\n\nContinuing this success, Brew reached the final of the 1985 UK national championship where he narrowly beat a strong field, including Rugby League player Joe Lydon, Olympic silver medallist Judoka Neil Adams and then only a one-time Olympic gold medal winning rower, Steve Redgrave. The RAF officer then completed a successful first year in Superstars by becoming the last ever International champion, this time much more comfortably.\n\nA new period of Superstars dominance could have evolved for Brew, but with the UK version being the only surviving national championship outside the United States, and no prospect of World Superstars being revived, once TWI decided to halt production of International Superstars the BBC version was soon cancelled as well. With viewing figures falling, and potential participants ever more pressurised into not entering by scheduling conflicts and insurance demands the BBC's decision to end the show was neither unexpected or mourned, and although David Vine, Ron Pickering and executive producer Peter Hylton Cleaver did fight to keep the show on air, it was all to no avail.\n\nOver the next fifteen years, though the US version continued unabated, Superstars in the UK existed solely as a nostalgic memory for sporting clip shows, usually focussing on Kevin Keegan falling off his bike, Stan Bowles shooting the table instead of a target, or Brian Jacks eating oranges. During the 1990s BBC programmes (such as \"Fantasy Football League\") regularly made use of this footage – and kept the show in the public spotlight – while Sky Sports began to show full-length programmes on its \"Sky Sports Classic\" channel. This, together with a new generation of television executives and sports presenters who grew up as fans of the show created interest in a revival, which finally happened as part of the 2002 Sport Relief charity event.\n\nIn 2002, the BBC held a one-off, but truncated, UK Championship as a major feature of its biannual Sport Relief charity telethon. Featuring a field including Sir Steve Redgrave, Martin Offiah, John Regis, Austin Healey and Chris Boardman, the event was a first for a British Superstars event in that it featured both non-British competitors (Dwight Yorke and Gianluca Vialli) and also female participants (Alex Coomber and Stephanie Cook). With only seven events (as opposed to the usual eight or ten) and being only part of a larger event instead of being a stand-alone series, the contest was different from those of the earlier era.\n\nWhile the participants were no less able, the event was less 'competitive', with no prize money at stake and no European, World or International contest to qualify for. It was dominated by Healey, who won four of his five events, and came runner-up in the other. Stephanie Cook was the other stand-out performer, finishing joint second with Olympic cycling champion Chris Boardman, and finishing runner-up in two events.\n\nThe event was an overwhelming success, and it inspired the BBC to create a new UK Championship series in 2003. Produced by TWI and held in La Manga Club in Spain, this time it was a full event with heats and a final, something that had not been part of the series since 1983.\n\nOn 29 April 2008, it was announced that the show would be returning on Five for the summer of 2008. It was produced by TWI with eight one-hour shows. In a change of format, the competitors were split into four teams, captained by Kelly Holmes, Steve Redgrave, Roger Black and Mike Catt.\n\nFollowing the success of Team GB at the 2012 London Olympics, the BBC revived \"Superstars\" for a single special edition that aired on Saturday 29 December at 6.45pm, comprising a men's and women's UK championship. Presented by Gabby Logan, Iwan Thomas and Denise Lewis, the event was held on 24 & 25 November 2012, at the sports facilities of the University of Bath.\n\nThe show featured Olympic medallists who were coached for swimming by Rebecca Adlington, and the competitors were: Alistair Brownlee, Jonathan Brownlee, Mo Farah, Robbie Grabarz, Michael Jamieson, Anthony Joshua, Andrew Triggs Hodge, Peter Wilson, Nicola Adams, Lizzie Armitstead, Laura Bechtolsheimer, Gemma Gibbons, Helen Glover, Katherine Grainger, Jade Jones, Christine Ohuruogu.\n\nThe Men's Championship was won comfortably by Olympic Super-heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua, while the Women's Championship was won even more convincingly by women's coxless pair Olympic champion Helen Glover. Joshua won with an event to spare, while Glover won her final event (the Gym Tests) to win the Women's Superstars title by 14 points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Superstars\" was first broadcast by ABC Sports as a two-hour special in 1973. Bob Seagren, an Olympic pole vault gold medalist, was the first winner. However, it was heavyweight champion boxer Joe Frazier who nearly stole the show. In the very first event, the 50 meter swimming heats, Frazier nearly drowned, and only after he was retrieved from the pool did he admit to commentators that he didn't know how to swim. When a reporter asked him why he tried the race, Frazier replied, \"How was I to know I couldn't unless I tried it?\". He also famously opined, \"That Mark Spitz,\" (who had won several gold medals for swimming at the 1972 Olympics) \"is a tough muthafucker!\"\n\nSpin-offs included a women's version of the show, and a \"Superteams\" version, where the two World Series and Super Bowl teams each faced off (except that the owner of the New York Yankees at the time, George Steinbrenner prohibited his players from competing, so in years where the Yankees were in the World Series, their league's runner-up competed instead), with the winners competing in the finals. There were also brief runs of versions for celebrities and for juniors, where each state's Department of Education was asked to nominate one high school, and those schools each sent one boy and one girl to qualifying rounds, with the final aired on TV.\n\nThe show remained popular in the 1970s, but ratings declined and the last edition produced by ABC came in 1984. NBC Sports picked up the program the next year and carried it from 1985 to 1990. ABC took the show back in 1991, and broadcast it through 1994. During a three-year period (1991–1993) the event was held in Cancun, Mexico. The competitions were held in different areas of Cancun Palace and Melia Cancun hotels. During that period former great NFL players Frank Gifford, Dan Dierdorf and Lynn Swann worked as commentators of the Superstars Tournament.\n\nThere was no American version for three years (1995–1997) then ABC revived the show in 1998 and broadcast it through 2002. CBS Sports picked up the show the next year.\n\nSeveral athletes won the event two or more times. Among them:\n\nSpeed skater Anne Henning won three straight women's competitions (1976–78). Basketball player Ann Meyers matched that feat in 1981 through 1983. Volleyball player Linda Fernandez won two straight events in 1979 and 1980.\n\nIn 2009 the franchise was revived for ABC. \"The Superstars\" paired athletes and celebrities to compete as a team. Kristi Leskinen (Freestyle Skiing) and Maksim Chmerkovskiy (Ballroom Dancing) won the competition.\n\nThe popular obstacle course was the final event of the original \"Superstars\" to determine the overall winner. The \"Superteams\" version featured the obstacle course as an earlier event. The original course had the contestants climb a 12' rope wall, run through a tubular tunnel, push a blocking sled (or traverse across monkey bars in the Women's and \"Superteams\" versions), cleanly step through a dozen tires (2 rows of 6), jump over a water hazard (rectangular pool of water), clear a 4'6\" high bar, jump two sets of hurdles and cross the FINISH line. Penalty seconds were added for missing tires, stepping in the water hazard and knocking down the high bar and/or hurdles. Some athletes have shown super skills on this course by climbing the wall without using the rope and clearing the high bar like a hurdle.\n\nFor the 2009 \"elimination event\" version, contestants have to climb a rope wall, duck under four rope hurdles (2 sets side-by-side) (this was changed mid-season to a balance beam just over 3-inches wide), cleanly step through a bungee grid, ascend and descend a large ramp, push through a large door-like block, jump two sets of hurdles, run through a cargo net and cross the FINISH line.\n\nA companion competition, this event would pit the two World Series teams and the two Super Bowl teams in a playoff-type match using all the Superstars events, with some team events added such as Hawaiian rowing and the Tug-of-War. The running, swimming, and cycling events were relays, with the cycling done on tandem bikes; the obstacle course (which had its blocking sleds replaced by monkey bars similar to those used in the women's competition, as it was felt that the football teams would have too much of an advantage over the baseball teams) was decided by best combined time. The team that won the most events in each semi-final advanced to the SuperTeams finals where an ultimate champions would be crowned. The New York Yankees advanced to the World Series in 1977, 1978, and 1981, and was eligible to participate in these events held the early in the following year, however Yankees owner George Steinbrenner refused to allow his players to compete, as he had several of his top players under lucrative long term guaranteed contracts that required players to get ownership permission to participate in outside athletic activities, which in this case Steinbrenner refused to grant. In those years, loser of the ALCS in those years took the Yankees place, and in all three years that team ultimately won the competition.\n\nIn the 1978 final, the Dallas Cowboys and Kansas City Royals split the first six events, so the tug-of-war would decide the winner. However, while there was a time limit in the preliminary rounds, there was none in the final, and after 75 minutes in which neither team came particularly close to winning, the organizers declared the event (and, as a result, the competition) a tie.\n\n\n1977 World Superstars Championship Final Result\n\nIn 1976, following the success of the \"Superstars\" programme in the US, Britain and mainland Europe, Dick Button and American host broadcaster ABC decided to organise a World Superstars Final, to be held the following March at Callaway Gardens in Georgia.\n\nThe participants in the inaugural \"World Superstars Championship\" were to be the competitors from across the various national and continental versions of the show with the best records in the previous years, and as such the US was to be represented by its previous national champions Bob Seagren, O. J. Simpson, and three time reigning current champion Kyle Rote, Jr. The rest of the participants were to be drawn from the top six finishers from the 1976 European Superstars final, the top six from the US version in 1977, and the winner of the 1976 Canadian Superstars event. In reality, as was always an issue for Superstars, several competitors withdrew in the weeks before the contest, with Rote and Simpson pulling out just a week before taping, leaving a slightly weakened field headed by Seagren, double European champion Kjell Isaksson, Canadian champion Tony Gabriel and the joint runners-up from the US final Guy Drut and Dave Casper.\n\nAside from the withdrawals of Rote and Simpson the other major omission from the field was the double British champion and 1975 European runner-up David Hemery who was studying at university in the US, and had failed to qualify for the 1976 European final after finishing a narrow third in his heat. Had he paddled his Kayak 0.4 seconds faster or scored two more points in the pistol shooting he would have made the final, and with other strong European challengers (like Ties Kruize, Kevin Keegan and Björn Borg) also absent, the European challenge was significantly poorer.\n\nThe contest started with Rowing, where Peter Snell capitalised on a mistake from fellow athlete Frank Nusse to win the first ten points, then the penalty shoot-out. Here Gareth Edwards was one kick away from winning nearly $5000, but he fluffed his final shot and had to settle for a five-way tie for second place, while Guy Drut easily won the play-off, and took the money. After this it became a two-way contest between the two pole-vaulters, Isaksson and Seagren.\n\nControversially, Seagren (by nature of being retired from IAAF competition) was allowed to run in the track and field events, while Isaksson was not. Seagren later admitted that this gave him a major advantage over his younger, Swedish rival, as running was a fundamental part of any pole-vaulter's training regime, and thus they had to be favoured in such events. While Seagren was unable to win the 100 yard sprint, he did score two points, and his win in the half-mile race gave him a further ten. Isaksson countered with a win in the gym tests and two second-place finishes in the bike race and weightlifting. Seagren however kept competing strongly and his victory in the swimming and second place in the gym tests saw him take a 33 points to 30 lead over Snell and Isaksson into the final event: the obstacle course.\n\nThis event was not held in Europe, and therefore Isaksson was attempting it for the first time. In the heats Isaksson ran a time of 25.81 seconds, while Snell was far behind with 29.2 seconds. Seagren however, with much more experience in the event, ran 0.8 seconds faster than the Swede, finishing in 24.64 seconds. His loss in the final to record holder Lynn Swann was irrelevant; the seven points for second place made him the first World Superstars Champion, and won him $37,000 in the process.\n\n1978 World Superstars Championship Final Result\n\nWith the Superstars franchise nearing its zenith of popularity, the World Championship returned in 1978 with a 12-man field consisting of the national champions from Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the top three finishers from the 1977 European Superstars final, and the top five from the 1978 US National Championship. Completing the line-up was the returning champion, Bob Seagren.\n\nThough the 1977 runner-up Kjell Isaksson was missing (he would not compete in Superstars again until 1980), Europe was strongly represented by Jean-Paul Coche, Keith Fielding and Ties Kruize, while Wayne Grimditch, Greg Pruitt and Dwight Stones (who could famously jump up the 10-feet high obstacle course wall in one stride) represented the US. It was the Canadian champion however, Brian Budd, who would completely dominate the contest, and World Superstars for the next three years.\n\nBudd was a strong all-round athlete, his soccer training covering swimming, running, bike racing and gym work. He also understood that the key to winning Superstars was to win as many points as possible in the events you were good at, and to hold on for as many points as possible in the others. He turned out to be nearly unbeatable in the gym, half-mile race and the swimming, and more than competent in cycling and rowing. In 1978 he won 44 points from these five events alone, ten points more than he needed to become World Champion.\n\nIn the 100-yard dash, joint favourites Greg Pruitt and Keith Fielding were both unbeaten in the 100 yards/metres, and a fabulous race was in prospect. Budd got off to a blistering start – according to the UK commentator Ron Pickering it was 'a flyer' – and led in the first 30 yards, but Pruitt, then Fielding accelerated, and the two had a large lead over the rest of the field. As they approached the finish line, Fielding pulled onto Pruitt's shoulder, then leaned as the two crossed the line together. Without photo-finish equipment the result had to be called from hand-timing only. Fielding was given a time of 9.97 seconds; Pruitt had officially run 9.96. Fielding believed he had won, as did the BBC commentators covering the final. Fielding's challenge was teetering, and in the half-mile run the searing Caribbean heat and a crazy pace he had attempted to catch up with Budd cost him physically; he collapsed of heat exhaustion and had to receive first aid and oxygen from Ron Pickering at track-side.\n\nFielding eventually battled on bravely to finish fifth (and top European), but it was Bob Seagren who again gave the strongest challenge. His consistent performances won him a clear second place, but he was still 14 points behind Budd. The Canadian had joked and fooled his way through the contest, but it was all a very good act. He was far and away the best multi-disciplined athlete in the field, and he would prove just as unbeatable in the following two years.\n\n1979 World Superstars Championship Final Result\n\nThe third World Championship was held in March 1979, again in the sweltering heat of Freeport, Bahamas. Budd returned as reigning World and Canadian champion (and strong favourite) with Pruitt back as well, but this time as US National Champion. The European challenge was again restricted by injury and conflicting commitments, and was restricted to three competitors: UK runner-ups Lynn Davies and Dave Boy Green and Irish Superstars champion Pat Spillane. The 1979 European Superstars final had finished with Ties Kruize and Brian Jacks joint-winners, but both had missed out on The Bahamas through injury. If Europe was perhaps under represented, then the US challenge was as formidable as ever, with Pruitt, Wayne Grimditch, Jim Taylor and Joe Theismann all qualifying. Completing the line-up were two invited challengers – not Hemery, Isaksson, Fielding or Kyle Rote though. Instead the organisers had asked both Emerson Fittipaldi and Rafael Septién to 'make up the numbers', even though only Fittipaldi had ever entered Superstars before, both in the US and Europe, but neither time with any success. They did however represent Brazil and Mexico respectively, and thus increase the media interest in the contest in Latin America. They would have little impact on the final.\n\nThat was not the case for Budd, who dominated again, winning three events comprehensively, setting new records in the swimming and half-mile run in the process. He also finished third in every other event he competed in, winning the title by thirteen points this time. While Grimditch and Pruitt won multiple events, they could not match Budd's consistency. Neither could the best European, Lynn Davies, who finished second in four events but disappointed in the weightlifting and gym tests. In the end only two points separated second to fourth, with Grimditch beating Pruitt for second on count-back, and Davies two points back in fourth.\n\nBudd had set new standards, and most viewers thought him unbeatable. There was only one caveat to this victory. The top Europeans Kruize and Jacks were not present, and with Jacks in particular even more dominant in the gym tests than Budd there were questions asked about what he could have achieved. They would meet a year later.\n\n1980 World Superstars Championship Final Result\n\nBrian Budd won by the largest margin ever in the World Championship, winning three of the sports and finishing second in four. Because this was his third consecutive championship, he was not allowed to participate in any more Superstars competitions.\n\n1981 World Superstars Championship Final Result\n\n1982 World Superstars Championship Final Result\n\nFor the British, European and International version of the show, and in all episodes broadcast in the UK (regardless of where the episode originated) the theme music is \"Heavy Action\", written by Johnny Pearson. The strong association of the theme music to Superstars has led to the music being frequently misidentified as \"Superstars\", even though it is used in other countries as the theme to other sports events (such as in the United States, where versions of the piece have served as the long-time theme music of the NFL \"Monday Night Football\" broadcasts on ABC and later ESPN).\n\nWhile not necessarily written specifically for the UK version of Superstars (with Heavy Action instead being written by Pearson for the BBC music library in 1970 while he was working on \"Top of the Pops\"), the music has now become synonymous with both Superstars in the UK, and indeed sport in general, still regularly used by the BBC on sports shows, such as during the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe ABC version in the 1970s and 1980s also used an instrumental version of \"Superstar\" from \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" as its theme.\n\n"}

All variations center on the theme of Jewish children feeling alienated during the Christmas season, and Sandler's listing of Jewish celebrities (both real and fictional) as a way of sympathizing with their situation.\n\nThis version appeared on Sandler's 1996 comedy album \"What the Hell Happened to Me?\".\n\nPersons referenced in \"The Chanukah Song\":\n\nSandler also makes reference to the Carnegie Deli, a famed Jewish restaurant in New York City (it closed in 2016), and mentions that \"you don't need\" two holiday songs that do not mention Christmas: \"Deck the Halls,\" a celebration of the Pagan holiday of Yule; and \"Jingle Bell Rock,\" a rockabilly winter song.\n\nDuring the final verse, performed originally on \"Saturday Night Live\" and on a radio cut, Sandler sings the line \"Drink your gin and tonic-ah, but don't smoke marijuan-icah\". On the uncut album version, and during various concert appearances, the line was changed to \"Drink your gin and tonic-ah, and smoke your marijuan-icah\". The uncut version, despite the reference to marijuana, receives most radio airplay today; another radio edit skips completely over the gin and tonic/marijuana line altogether.\n\n\"The Chanukah Song, Part II\" was recorded live at Brandeis University for Sandler's 1999 album \"Stan and Judy's Kid\".\n\nPersons referenced in \"The Chanukah Song, Part II\":\n\nOther pop culture references include: Manischewitz wine, Hooked on Phonics, Daryle Lamonica, and Tijuana, Mexico.\n\nIncluded on the \"Eight Crazy Nights\" soundtrack featuring vocals from actor Rob Schneider and the children's choir The Drei-Dels.\n\nPersons referenced in \"The Chanukah Song, Part III\":\n\nAlso, in an unedited version that Sandler sings at some of his comedy shows, he replaces the lyric \"As for half-Jewish actors/Sean Penn is quite the great one/And Marlon Brando's not a Jew at all/But it looks to me like he ate one\" with \"Gwyneth Paltrow's half-Jewish/But a full-time Oscar winner/Jennifer Connelly's half-Jewish, too/And I'd like to put some more in her\". While this version is not played on radio stations, the music video shows a background screen showing a picture of Sandler licking his lips as the Jennifer Connelly lyric is sung, with shocked laughter coming from the audience. This version is hidden about four minutes after the edited version on the \"Eight Crazy Nights\" soundtrack.\n\nAlthough Sandler does not actually mention Schneider by name as part of the song, he mentions , a character played by Schneider, in the lyric, \"but we can do it all night long, with \" (the \"you can do it\" line is also a reference to Schneider's recurring \"townie\" character that originally appeared in \"The Waterboy\"). As Sandler mentions Bigelow, Schneider walks on stage, yells, \"I'm Jewish!\", and joins in for an abbreviated chorus. After the chorus, he sings a Jewish reference for the song (Mickey Raphael, see above), using an Elvis-esque vocal tic, to which Sandler seemingly ad libs \"tiny Elvis, ladies and gentlemen, tiny Elvis!\" (a reference to a Saturday Night Live skit Schneider performed with Nicolas Cage; and possibly also to Elvis Presley, who was halakhically Jewish on account of his maternal great-great-grandmother) In the rehearsal version, Sandler then gives an aside of, \"Schneider, I did not even know you were Jewish,\" to which Schneider replies, \"I'm a Filipino Jew, in fact, I've gotta run home and light the first pig!\" In the aired version, Schneider states, \"I'm a Filipino Jew.\" When Sandler muses, \"Filipino Jew?\" Schneider responds, \"There are four of us.\" He then puts on a blonde wig and joins the \"Drei-dels,\" the backing chorus of children, to whom he is already similarly dressed.\n\nSandler first performed this version at a live Judd Apatow & Friends event, part of the New York Comedy Festival, in November 2015. Lyrics can be found at the Huffington Post link here.\n\nPersons referenced in \"The Chanukah Song Part IV\":\n\n\nJimmy Fallon impersonated Adam Sandler during a \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" sketch on \"Saturday Night Live\" on October 24, 1998. In the sketch, Fallon, as Sandler, interrupts Will Ferrell's Alex Trebek by playing guitar and singing (to the tune of the song's chorus and first few verses), \"Robert De Niro, Bela Lugosi, Snuffleupagus, and Parker Posey!\" (Actually, De Niro, Lugosi and Posey were all raised Roman Catholic; Jerry Nelson, the puppeteer who performed Snuffleupagus, was likewise not Jewish.)\n\nIn 2004, Jewish-Australian hardcore punk band Yidcore covered it as \"The Punk Rock Chanukah Song\" in which they list Jews involved with punk music.\n\nThis song was covered on two different occasions for the Broadway charity albums \"Carols for a Cure.\" In 2006, the cast of Broadway's \"The Wedding Singer\" sang the first installment of the song, led by Constantine Maroulis, and featuring help from violinist Alicia Svigals. In 2013, the song was covered once again by the cast of \"Soul Doctor\", however this time, the lyrics covered Jewish Broadway personalities, including Mandy Patinkin, Andrew Lippa, Harvey Fierstein, Harold Prince and others. These lyrics were written by the show's Shlomo actor Eric Anderson, who himself has been pointed out in the song as \"not a Jew.\"\n\nIn the season 3 \"The Office\" episode \"Diwali\", Michael Scott (Steve Carell) parodies Sandler by performing \"The Diwali Song\" during a Hindu Diwali festival.\n\nIn 2008, Unitarian-Universalist Evan Austin performed a parody of this song called \"The Chalica Song\" about the Unitarian-Universalist holiday of Chalica. Austin lists celebrities and historical persons who are \"Unitarian-Universalists. Or Unitarians. Or Universalists. Or people with similar ideas.\" In 2009, Austin recorded \"The (Second) Chalica Song\" with the same tune, but a new list of names.\n\nIn 2009, a cover of the song by Neil Diamond was released on \"A Cherry Cherry Christmas\". This version featured several changes in lyrics, including the change from \"Tom Cruise isn't but I heard his agent is\" to \"Tom Cruise isn't, but Jesus Christ is\".\n\nOn a 2014 episode of \"Robot Chicken\", Sandler appears in a sketch on how to spell \"Chanukah\", singing a brief snippet of the song describing how Angelina Jolie is not a Jew.\n\n\n"}

It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 1996. The 85 minute film was shot with 16mm film. The film was directed by Ira Sachs. It won the \"Outstanding Emerging Talent\" award at Outfest in 1997, and was also nominated for the \"Producer's Award\" (for producer Margot Bridger) at the 1997 and 1998 Independent Spirit Awards.\n\n\"The Delta\" tells the story of 18-year-old Lincoln Bloom (Shayne Gray), who, after leading a relatively straight teenage life, is slowly drawn into the LGBT world and discovers he is gay. After visiting various shady establishments (including gay bars, video arcades, etc.) and engaging in sexual acts with \"men he didn't know,\" Lincoln meets Minh Nguyen (Thang Chan), a Vietnamese immigrant, and travels down river with him in a cabin cruiser. In a doomed relationship, the two bond with each other, Lincoln neglecting to tell his girlfriend and leading two parallel lives. At the end of the film, Minh and Lincoln take a boat out on the Mississippi River to set off fireworks and this is where the film dramatically concludes.\n\n\n\"The Delta\" was filmed entirely in Memphis, Tennessee, Sachs's hometown, and includes scenes of Memphis locations.\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews, with IndieWire calling it the \"essence of independent film.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"...so evocative that it is poetic in its impact.\" However, it was also criticized by \"The New York Times\" and others for leaving viewers with too many questions and moving too abruptly from plotline to plotline.\n"}
{"id": "23765634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23765634", "title": "The X-Files (franchise)", "text": "The X-Files (franchise)\n\nThe X-Files is an American science fiction–thriller media franchise created by Chris Carter. The franchise generally focused on paranormal or unexplained happenings. The first franchise release—simply titled \"The X-Files\"—debuted in September 1993 and ended in May 2002. The show was a hit for Fox, and its characters and slogans (e.g., \"The Truth Is Out There\", \"Trust No One\", \"I Want to Believe\") became pop culture touchstones in the 1990s. 1996 saw the premiere of a second series set in the same universe but covering a storyline independent of the X-Files mythology, titled \"Millennium\". In 1998, the first \"X-Files\" feature film titled \"The X-Files\" was released, eventually grossing over $180 million. A spin-off—\"The Lone Gunmen\"—was released in 2001 and abruptly canceled. Six years after the initial television series was canceled, another film—\"\"—was released. In January 2016, a tenth season of \"The X-Files\" aired, featuring Carter as executive producer and writer, and starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson. An eleventh season premiered in January 2018.\n\nIn addition to film and television, \"The X-Files\" franchise has expanded into other media, including books, video games, and comic books. These supplements to the film and television series have resulted in significant development of the show's fictional universe and mythology. By May 2002, the franchise generated in total revenue.\n\n\"The X-Files\", starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, first aired on September 10, 1993. Originally following the work of Special Agent Fox Mulder, an FBI investigator assigned to the X-Files, a division tasked with the solving of cases for which there are no explanation. Special Agent Dana Scully, a shrewd medical doctor, is assigned to debunk Mulder's work, though as the two continue to investigate the unexplained and the paranormal, her own faith is also tested. Scully later works alongside both John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish). \"The X-Files\" is generally divided into two classes of episodes, the first, \"monster-of-the-week\", or stand-alone episodes, and the second, X-Files mythology, which follows a government conspiracy to hide the truth about the existence of extraterrestrial life. The series also stars Mitch Pileggi as Assistant Director Walter Skinner, William B. Davis as The Smoking Man and John Neville as Well-Manicured Man.\n\n\"Millennium\", aired from 1996 to 1999, stars Lance Henriksen as Frank Black, a skilled criminal psychologist who could predict the actions of murderers and serial killers. Investigating the horrific crimes, Black eventually became a consultant for the Millennium Group, which believed that the world as we know it would come to an end at the beginning of the new millennium; a job which eventually leads to the demise of his wife, Catherine (Megan Gallagher). In the third season, Black turns on the group and rejoins the FBI as a special agent, working alongside Special Agent Emma Hollis (Klea Scott) to solve brutal crimes within the FBI's jurisdiction.\n\n\"The Lone Gunmen\", the third series in the \"X-Files\" franchise, follows the established characters of Richard Langly, Melvin Frohike and John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood, Tom Braidwood, and Dean Haglund), in their attempts to compile conspiracy-theorist magazine. Far more light-hearted than its predecessors, this series also stars Stephen Snedden as Jimmy Bond, and Zuleikha Robinson as Yves Harlow.\n\n\"The X-Files\" has crossed over with both \"Millennium\" and \"The Lone Gunmen\", as well as \"The Simpsons\" (in the season 8 episode \"The Springfield Files\").\n\n\nThe first feature film, \"The X-Files\", was released in 1998 in between the fifth and sixth season. It was intended to be a continuation of the season five finale \"The End\", but also be able to stand on its own. Season six opener \"The Beginning\" picked up where the film left off. The majority of the film was shot in the break between the series' fourth and fifth seasons. The film follows the actions of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) after their dismissal from the X-Files division.\n\nUnlike the first film, the plot of \"\" does not focus on the series' ongoing extraterrestrial-based \"mytharc\" and instead works as a standalone thriller–horror story. The film details ex-agents Mulder and Scully's search for a missing FBI agent. While Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) makes a notable appearance, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) are absent from the film. During a July 2013 panel discussion at the San Diego Comic-Con hosted by \"TV Guide\", both Anderson and Duchovny expressed willingness to do a third feature film, but Carter was more reserved at the idea, stating, \"You need a reason to get excited about going on and doing it again.\"\n\n\"The X-Files\" stars David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, and Mitch Pileggi, alongside Blythe Danner, Martin Landau, and William B. Davis. \"The X-Files: I Want to Believe\" stars Duchovny, Anderson, and Pileggi, alongside Amanda Peet, Xzibit, and Billy Connolly.\n\nThere are three series of novels based on \"The X-Files\" franchise, one based on each of the three shows. During the run of the television series \"The X-Files\", many books based on it were written and released, including novels based on episodes, a series of comic books from Topps Comics, and many \"official\" and \"unauthorized\" non-fiction books. Some of the novels, which were published in both hardcover and trade paperback editions, were adapted into audiobooks read by two of the series' stars, Gillian Anderson and Mitch Pileggi. Three \"X-Files\" books rose to the top-selling list over Europe and North America. These books were \"The Official Guide to The X-Files\", \"The Unofficial X-Files Companion\" and \"The X-Files Book of the Unexplained\". series of licensed tie-in comics based on \"The X-Files\" were launched in 2004, by Topps Comics, and in 2008 by the DC Comics imprint WildStorm. The Fox Broadcasting Network publishes the official \"The X-Files Magazine\". In total, five novels have been based on \"Millennium\", the first being a novelization of the pilot episode. Some novels were also released as audiobooks read by actor Bill Smitrovich. In 2015, a comic book adaptation of \"Millennium\" was released.\n\n\"The X-Files\" spawned a large number of spin-off products. \"The X-Files\" Collectible Card Game was released in 1996, and an expansion pack was released in 1997. \"The X-Files\" has inspired three video games. In 1998, \"The X-Files Game\" was released for the PC and Macintosh and a year later for the PlayStation. This game is set within the timeline of the second or third season and follows Agent Craig Willmore in his search for the missing Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. In 2000, Fox Interactive released \"\", a game-style database for Windows and Mac, which allowed users access to every case file. Then, in 2004, \"\" was released for the PlayStation 2. This game is an original story set in the seventh season and allows the player control of both Mulder and Scully. Both games feature acting and voice work from members of the series' cast. A 12-inch Frank Black figurine was issued by Sideshow in the same mold as \"The X-Files\" characters Fox Mulder and Dana Scully earlier.\n\n\"The X-Files\" franchise has influenced many series over the years and became a television touchstone of the '90s. The first installment, \"The X-Files\", became an international hit and its two main actors, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, became international sex symbols. Series such as \"Bones\", \"Fringe\" and \"Lost\" have cited \"The X-Files\" as a major influence. The series has also topped ranking polls worldwide, but most notably in the English-speaking world. Carter, Duchovny and Anderson celebrated the 20th anniversary of the series at a July 18, 2013, panel at the San Diego Comic-Con hosted by \"TV Guide\". During the discussion, Anderson discussed Scully's impact on female fans, relating that a number of women have informed her that they entered into careers in physics because of the character.\n\nThe two other series in the franchise have, on the other hand, made less impact. \"Millennium\", while well received by many critics, garnered criticism for the episodes being similar to each other in content and themes. \"Variety\" magazine reviewer Jeremy Gerard, although his review was mostly favorable, criticized it for giving him the \"nagging feeling\" that it wanted to hurt him. Many reviewers noted the dark storylines of the series, which were constantly mentioned as a reason why the show never became widely popular. The spin-off, entitled \"The Lone Gunmen\", lasted only one season due to declining viewership, although it too earned largely positive reviews.\n\nOn January 17, 2015, Fox confirmed that they were looking at the possibility of bringing \"The X-Files\" back. Fox chairman Dana Walden told reporters that \"conversations so far have only been logistical and are in very early stages\" and that the series would only go forward if Carter, Anderson, and Duchovny were all on board, and that it was a matter of ensuring all of their timetables are open. The X-Files (season 10) aired in January and February 2016.\n\n"}

{"id": "33463260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33463260", "title": "Zielony Balonik", "text": "Zielony Balonik\n\nZielony Balonik (literally, \"the Green Balloon\") was a popular literary cabaret founded in Kraków by the local poets, writers and artists during the final years of the Partitions of Poland. The venue was a gourmet restaurant of Apolinary J. Michalik called the \"Michalik's Den\" (Jama Michalika). The cabaret was founded in 1905 and ran regularly until 1912 (staged occasionally until 1915).\n\nThe grand opening of the \"Green Balloon\" cabaret took place on October 7, 1905 in a located in the heart of Kraków Old Town, not far from the medieval St. Florian's Gate. It was an \"art cabaret\", meant only for the cultural elite. The organizers made sure that the guests show enthusiasm; those who didn't, were no longer invited. As a result the audience consisted of a closed group of regulars, whose composition didn't change. Soon, rumors began to spread among the local bourgeoisie that the \"Green Balloon\" stage was a place of \"orgies, nude dancing and all manner of dissipation\". Boy-Żeleński responded on behalf of \"Zielony Balonik\" by writing a bawdy, humorous poem \"Pieśń dziadkowa\" (Grandpas Song) confirming that indeed, it is a Sodom and Gomorrah, synonymous with impenitent sin. However, the elitist treatment carried with it a major drawback. Gradually the ground breaking stage performances became depleted of fresh new topics and captivating lyrics for the songs, and the intervention of preventive censorship in the cabaret's scripted dialogues by Austrian authorities resulted in further avoidance of any pressing political issues stemming from the foreign occupation of the country.\n\nOver time even the regulars began to miss Balonik's earlier \"green humor\". One additional reason for its slow but relentless disintegration was that the living conditions of contributing artists began to deteriorate under the repressive Austrian rule. The patrons turned reluctant to dig further into the mine field of political satire concerned with the suppression of freedoms. It was one of the main distinguishing features of \"Zielony Balonik\" from the French and German cabarets of the time.\n\nThe main contributors included two Masters of Ceremonies: Jan August Kisielewski, and Stanisław Sierosławski; the slew of writers such as: Witold Noskowski, Tadeusz Zakrzewski, Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński (from 1906), Adolf Nowaczyński, Edward Leszczyński, Leon Schiller, and Juliusz Osterwa; as well as a group of visual artists in charge of set-design and exhibits, including: Witold Wojtkiewicz, Kazimierz Sichulski, Karol Frycz, Henryk Szczygliński, Alfons Karpiński, Stanisław Kamocki, Stanisław Kuczborski, Stefan Filipkiewicz, Henryk Uziembło, Fryderyk Pautsch, married couple Tadeusz Rychter and his wife Bronisława Janowska who designed political puppets (1868–1953), Ludwik Puget and Ignacy Blaschke.\n\n"}
