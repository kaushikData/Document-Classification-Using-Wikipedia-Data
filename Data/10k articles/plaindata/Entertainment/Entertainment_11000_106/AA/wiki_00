The magazine was launched on March 15, 2005 by Rachel Aimee, Rebecca Lynn, and Raven Strega. \"$pread\" was based in New York City, and was sold throughout the United States and Canada at independent bookstores and via national distributors.\n\nA co-editor said, \"We want the general public to become aware of issues such as the physical working conditions of sex workers and their health care and housing needs, and to start considering sex workers as real people rather than mythical beasts who only come to life when someone drops a quarter into a slot.\"\n\n\"$pread\" published personal experiences, political insights, and contained practical information, such as news, features, health columns, and sex industry resources. \"$pread\" supported the sex work community by donating 15% of each print run to the workplaces of and the outreach organizations utilized by sex workers. The tax outreach program \"helps sex workers who don't know they can and should file taxes\", said Audacia Ray, an executive editor at the magazine.\n\nAs of August 30, 2010, \"$pread\" has ceased printed publication due to both financial issues and not having enough people to keep the operation running, even if \"there was $100k made available\".\n\nBecause \"$pread\" was part of the sex workers rights movement, it was criticized by some branches of feminism that believe that sex work is inherently degrading:\nAmong feminists, perceptions are no less polarized – sex workers are either fully empowered agents using their sexuality in unassailably positive ways, or victims of a job that degrades them by its very nature. Most feminist dialogues about sex work sound more like monologues; defensiveness, mischaracterizations, and willful ignorance abound, making casualties of complexity and nuance.\n\nThe Feminist Press released a collection of some of the articles and essays from the original publications of the magazine into a 368-page book on the 15th March 2015 entitled \"$pread : The Best of the Magazine that Illuminated the Sex Industry and Started a Media Revolution\".\n\n\"Mary Christmas\" is a pseudonym of Emily O'Hara, an activist and a former editor of \"$pread\" magazine, a New York-based magazine on sex industry workers' rights.

{"id": "563545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=563545", "title": "Absolute music", "text": "Absolute music\n\nAbsolute music (sometimes abstract music) is music that is not explicitly \"about\" anything; in contrast to program music, it is non-representational. The idea of absolute music developed at the end of the 18th century in the writings of authors of early German Romanticism, such as Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder, Ludwig Tieck and E. T. A. Hoffmann but the term was not coined until 1846 where it was first used by Richard Wagner in a programme to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.\n\nThe aesthetic ideas underlying the absolute music derive from debates over the relative value of what were known in the early years of aesthetic theory as the fine arts. Kant, in his \"Critique of Aesthetic Judgment\", dismissed music as \"more enjoyment than culture\" because of its lack of conceptual content, thus taking as a negative the very feature of music that others celebrated. Johann Gottfried Herder, in contrast, regarded music as the highest of the arts because of its spirituality, which Herder linked to the invisibility of sound. The ensuing arguments among musicians, composers, music historians and critics have, in effect, never stopped.\n\nA group of Romantics consisting of Johann Gottfried Herder, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Jean Paul Richter and E.T.A. Hoffmann gave rise to the idea of what can be labeled as \"spiritual absolutism\". In this respect, instrumental music transcends other arts and languages to become the discourse of a 'higher realm' – rooted greatly in Hoffmann’s famous review of Beethoven’s 5th Symphony, published in 1810. These protagonists believed that music could be more emotionally powerful and stimulating without words. According to Richter, music would eventually 'outlast' the word.\n\nFormalism is the concept of music for music's sake and refers to instrumental music. In this respect, music has no meaning at all and is enjoyed by appreciation of its formal structure and technical construction. The 19th century music critic Eduard Hanslick argued that music could be enjoyed as pure sound and form, that it needed no connotation of extra-musical elements to warrant its existence. In fact, these extra-musical ideas detracted from the beauty of the music. The Absolute, in this case, is the purity of the art.\n\nFormalism therefore rejected genres such as opera, song and tone poems as they conveyed explicit meanings or programmatic imagery. Symphonic forms were considered more aesthetically pure. (The choral finale of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, as well as the programmatic Sixth Symphony, became problematic to formalist critics who had championed the composer as a pioneer of the Absolute, especially with the late quartets).\n\nCarl Dahlhaus describes absolute music as music without a \"concept, object, and purpose\".\n\nThe majority of opposition to the idea of instrumental music being 'absolute' came from Richard Wagner. It seemed ludicrous to him that art could exist without meaning; for him it had no right to exist.\n\nWagner considered the choral finale of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony to be the proof that music works better with words, famously saying: \"Where music can go no further, there comes the word ... the word stands higher than the tone.\"\n\nWagner also called Beethoven's Ninth Symphony the death knell of the symphony, for he was far more interested in combining all forms of art with his .\n\nToday, the debate continues over whether music has meaning or not. However, most contemporary views, reflecting ideas emerging from views of subjectivity in linguistic meaning arising in cognitive linguistics, as well as Kuhn's work on cultural biases in science and other ideas on meaning and aesthetics (e.g. Wittgenstein on cultural constructions in thought and language), appear to be moving \ntowards a consensus that music provides at least some signification or meaning, in terms of which it is \"understood\".\n\nThe cultural bases of musical understanding have been highlighted in Philip Bohlman's work, who considers music as a form of cultural communication:\n\nBohlman has gone on to argue that the use of music, e.g. among the Jewish diaspora, was in fact a form of \"identity building\".\n\nSusan McClary has criticised the notion of 'absolute music', arguing that all music, whether explicitly programmatic or not, contains implicit programs that reflect the tastes, politics, aesthetic philosophies and social attitudes of the composer and their historical situation. Such scholars would argue that classical music is rarely about nothing, but reflects aesthetic tastes that are themselves influenced by culture, politics and philosophy. Composers are often bound up in a web of tradition and influence, in which they strive to consciously situate themselves in relation to other composers and styles. Lawrence Kramer, on the other hand, believes music has no means to reserve a \"specific layer or pocket for meaning. Once it has been brought into sustainable connection with a structure of prejudgment, music simply becomes meaningful.\"\n\nMusic which appears to demand an interpretation, but is abstract enough to warrant objectivity (e.g. Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony), is what Lydia Goehr refers to as 'double-sided autonomy'. This happens when the formalist properties of music became attractive to composers because, having no meaning to speak of, music could be used to envision an alternative cultural and/or political order, while escaping the scrutiny of the censor (particularly common in Shostakovich, most notably the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies).\n\nOn the topic of musical meaning, \nWittgenstein, at several points in his late diary \"Culture and Value\", ascribes meaning to music, for instance, that in the finale, \na conclusion is being drawn, e.g.:\nJerrold Levinson has drawn extensively on Wittgenstein to comment: \n\n"}

Blood and Frances Emma Stewart. Frances was a member of the Alameda school department for many years. Adele moved to the eastern United States some years before 1917. As a youth, she was a talented equestrienne, had an interest in fashion, and admired the theater.\n\nBlood's first public performance was at the California Theatre in San Francisco. She acted the character \"Marguerite\" in a production featuring Lewis Morrison as \"Mephisto\". Blood appeared in numerous plays as the leading lady. Some of the theatrical presentations in which she starred are \"The Unmasking\", \"All Rivers Meet The Sea\", and \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\". In the latter she was with the stock company of Edward Davis, her first husband. Davis was a clergyman-actor who was formerly the pastor of the First Christian Church in Oakland, California. Their marriage was turbulent and Blood began divorce proceedings in 1914. Actress Jule Power was named as co-respondent in her suit. Davis responded by naming Governor Earl Brewer of Mississippi as co-respondent in counter charges against Blood. She finally won her divorce suit after which she left on a tour of the Orient. Following her divorce from Davis she was briefly married to Englishman Waddell Hope.\n\nDuring her vaudeville tours Blood was on stage in most of the prominent cities in the United States. She starred for five years in \"Everywoman\". During her travels she was known as \"the most beautiful blonde on the American stage\". She made two motion pictures including \"The Devil's Toy\" (1916) and \"\" (1920).\n\nBy December 1917, Blood retired. She became the devoted companion of her sister-in-law, Susanna Holmes, who was known as the \"Silver Queen\". Blood became named heiress to the Holmes' fortune. Blood eventually eschewed both wealth and social position because she believed it led to a philosophy of pessimism. She returned to the stage by accepting an offer from the Oriental company of Tim Frawley.\n\nIn 1926 she met Colonel R.W. Castle in Kashmir. He was an English officer in the Indian service. The two were engaged and planned a wedding in Calcutta.\n\nOn the night of September 13, 1936, Blood shot herself in the head at her home on the grounds of the Westchester Country Club in Harrison, New York. She died a few hours later at the United Hospital in Port Chester, New York.\n\nHer 17-year-old daughter, Dawn, was in the home with friends when they heard the sound of a gunshot come from Blood's bedroom. Dawn told police that her mother had been financially pressed and worried excessively in the previous two weeks.\n\nAdele's possessions were auctioned off garnering $1,000.\n\nDawn Blood committed suicide in July 1939. She was 19.\n\nBlood financed a summer stock company and leased the auditorium of the Bronxville High School for plays. The plays were scheduled to run for six weeks, but closed in three weeks. Both mother and daughter appeared in the casts.\n\n"}

Hu in 2003 to measure the authority power of players in a well-contracted organization. The index generates the Shapley-Shubik power index and can be used in ranking, planning and organizational choice.\n\nThe organization contracts each individual by boss and approval relation with others. So each individual has its own authority structure, called command game. The Shapley-Shubik power index for these command games are\ncollectively denoted by a power transit matrix Ρ.\n\nThe authority distribution π is defined as the solution to the counterbalance equation π=πΡ. The basic idea for the counterbalance equation is that a person's power comes from his critical roles in others' command game; on the other hand, his power could also be redistributed to those who sit in his command game as vital players.\n\nFor a simple legislative body, π is simply the Shapley-Shubik power index, based on a probabilistic argument (,).\n\nExample 1. College ranking by applicants’ acceptance\n\nSuppose that there are large numbers of college applicants to apply the colleges\nEach applicant files multiple applications. Each college then offers some\nof its applicants admissions and rejects all others. Now some applicants may get no offer\nfrom any college; the other then get one offer or multiple offers. An applicant with multiple\noffers will decide which college to go to and reject all other colleges which make offers\nto him. Of all applicants who apply to and receive offers from College i, we let P(i,j) be\nthe proportion of those applicants who decide to go to college j. Such applicants of\ncourse apply to and receive offers from College j as well.\n\nTo rank the colleges by the acceptance rates of the applicants to whom offers were\nmade, we can apply the authority distribution associated with the matrix P. The so-called “authority distribution” can be regarded as the measure of relative\nattractiveness of the colleges from the applicants’ point of view.\n\nExample 2. Journal rankings by citations\n\nAssume there are n journals in a scientific field. For any Journal i, each issue\ncontains many papers, and each paper has its list of references or citations. A paper in journal j\ncan be cited in another paper in Journal i as a reference. Of all papers cited by Journal i (repetition\ncounted), we let P(i,j) be the proportion of those papers which are published on Journal j. So P\nmeasures the direct impact between any two journals and P(i, i) is the self-citation rate\nfor Journal i . The authority distribution for π = πP would quantify the long-term influence of\neach journal in the group of journals and can be used to rank these journals.\n\nExample 3. Planning of a freeway system\n\nA few small towns believe that building a freeway system would be to their common\nbenefit. Say, they plan to build freeways F1,F2, . . . ,Fn−1. We let Fn be the existing traffic\nchannels of car, truck and bus. We assume that all the potential freeways have the same\nlength. Otherwise we can make up the assumption by dividing long freeways into smaller\nsegments and rename them all. The freeways with higher traffic intensity should be built\nwith more driving lanes and so receive more investments. Of all the traffic flow on Fi, we\nlet P(i,j) be the (estimated) proportion of the traffic flowing into Fj . Then the authority\ndistribution π satisfying π = πP will measure the relative traffic intensity on each Fi and\ncan be used in the investment allocation.\n\nA similar issue can be found in designing an Internet or Intranet system.\n\nExample 4. Real Effective Exchange Rates Weights\n\nAssume there are n countries. Let P(i,j) be country j's weights of consumption of country's total production.\nThe associated π measures the weights in the trading system of n countries.\n\n\n"}

Arcade is a video game developed by Austrian indie studio Bplus for Nintendo 3DS' eShop service. It was released in the United States on April 17, 2014 and in Europe on April 24, 2014. It's a sequel to the 2009 released \"Bit Boy!!\" for Nintendo's WiiWare service and the second installment of the \"Bit Boy!!\" series.\nIt uses a 3D, isometric playing field, with polygon characters.\nAccording to Bplus two more sequels will be released in undefined future.\n\nPlayers control a red cube named Kubi (from (kubos) ), who they must navigate through a series of worlds. The game follows the principle of rescuing Kubi's friends and avoid monsters that roam the levels. \nThe main goal in each phase, each level consists of 10 normal and 10 action phases, is to rescue seven of Kubis friends.\n\nThe publisher denotes the game with the terms \"Hide + Seek\", \"Avoid + Collect\" and \"Action + Puzzle\". \nEach level is based on a square floor plan. On this grid-like basis Kubi is moved. The camera is oriented isometric. \nThe players define how fast Kubi is moving by pressing the control pad and the buttons at the same time. Depending on how fast they are pressed Kubi moves fast or slow.\nThe game uses the 3DS featured play coins to give the player the ability to purchase continues like it would be in a real arcade machine.\n\nZeLeLi is a mighty gearwheel-shaped being created out of the essence of our dying sun 7 billion years in the future.

Forcefully cut out of the negative space of a black hole, the black Shadow Plättchen represent exactly the opposite of ZeLeLi. Like the ZeLeLi, Plättchen are not limited within the constrains of time and space.\nWherever they come along they spread massive havoc. \nCentral to the plot of the game are two main characters, the games hero Kubi and the game designer Bernd. He appears as a through the air floating pixel head and talks to Kubi during the games sequences.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Kubi gets killed by a monster created from the black Shadow Plättchen. Bernd is devastated and pleads ZeLeLi for help. ZeLeLi turns back the time and gives Kubi and Bernd the ability to speak to each other. In the mean time Bernd deleted the game in which Kubi died to create another one in whom his hero doesn't have to suffer this fate. Kubi thinks that Bernd is the one who has kidnaped all of his friends and refuses to be the hero unless Bernd designs the game exactly like Kubi wants it to be. As the story continues it is hinted that Bernd even if he is the developer of the game is not allmighty. The Shadow Plättchen gained power by killing small fairies called Pixel Flies and by kidnaping their king. With this power they got the ability to take influence on the game. So Kubi and Bernd are forced to work together to save Kubis friends and the game itself.\n\n\"Bit Boy!! Arcade\" was produced by Bplus. The first announcement was made via press release on 16 February 2012 stating that the game was halfway done. A first playable demo was shown at E3 2012.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews. Nintendo Life praised the overworld, saying it was one of the most interesting on the gaming history and also said it had an excellent soundtrack, but criticized the gameplay was broken and it was hard to play.\n\n"}

It premiered on Eleven on 1 September 2015. The episode was written by series producer Jason Herbison and directed by Declan Eames. It is \"Neighbours\" first three-hander in 30 years. Typically episodes of the show feature the ensemble cast and multiple on-going storylines. \"Episode 7202\" focuses on the conclusion to a long-running love triangle between Lauren Turner (Kate Kendall), Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin) and Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou). Herbison hoped the episode would be memorable for viewers, while Gamblin was grateful that he, Elmaloglou and Kendall were trusted enough with it. \n\nKendall thought the love-triangle was the perfect storyline to use the three-hander style and Elmaloglou said the consequences would be felt for a long time within the show. The episode was filmed in early June 2015. It is set in just two of the six houses on Ramsay Street. The actors described the filming schedule as \"pretty busy\" and a \"collaborative effort\". The episode was preceded by an online bonus scene titled \"Before Dawn\". \"Episode 7202\" received a positive reception from television critics, with one calling it \"an ambitious move\" and another dubbing it a \"landmark episode\" for the show. For his work on the episode, Herbison earned an AWGIE Award for Best Script for a Television Serial.\n\nAfter spending the night together, Lauren Turner (Kate Kendall) and Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin) discuss how things have changed between them. At Number 22, Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) wakes up on the sofa alone and stares at an empty wine glass. Lauren asks Brad what he and Terese argued about and he tells her that Terese has not been attending her AA meetings. Lauren then tells him that their night together does not have to go any further, but they agree to tell Terese, even though it could spell the end of the Willis's marriage. As he returns home, Brad finds Terese pouring a bottle of wine down the sink. She admits that she has a drinking problem and is willing to change. Terese then visits Lauren to ask for phone numbers of counsellors. Lauren calls Brad to tell him they can not reveal their affair to Terese. However, Terese receives an email containing aerial photos of the neighbourhood and she sees a picture of Brad and Lauren kissing. Realising that her husband has begun an affair, a devastated Terese returns to Number 32. \n\nTerese baits Lauren with questions about Brad until Lauren realises that Terese knows. Brad sees the email and returns to Lauren's home where Terese throws a jam jar at him. In the garden, Terese forces Lauren to admit that she has had feelings for Brad since they were reunited two years ago. Terese believes the affair has been going on for a while, and tries to find proof on Lauren's phone. She pushes Lauren into the swimming pool during the struggle. Brad goes after Terese and tries to explain that he and Lauren were going to tell her. Brad begs Terese to keep her appointment with the councillor, while she tells him to leave. Brad goes back to Lauren and asks if she meant what she said about having feelings for him for all that time. She says yes and gives him an ultimatum – try to work out a relationship with her or save his marriage to Terese. After leaving a sketch of Brad that Lauren drew on the lawn of Number 32, Terese calls her son and asks him to bring everyone home.\n\nOn 18 August 2015, David Knox of TV Tonight reported that \"Neighbours\" would be airing their first three-hander – an episode that features just three characters – on 1 September. The show's episodes usually feature an ensemble cast with multiple on-going storylines. While Knox observed that it is uncommon for an Australian drama to focus on so few actors. \"Episode 7202\" centres on the conclusion to a love-triangle storyline that has been running since 2013, with Brad Willis finally choosing Lauren Turner over his wife Terese. The episode is set in just two houses on opposite sides of Ramsay Street, and the scenes deal with three of the five stages of grief: denial, anger and bargaining.\n\nThe show's series producer Jason Herbison wrote the episode, and he hoped that it would be memorable for viewers in the future. He admitted to being worried about how the actors would react to the script, explaining \"I was a bit nervous when I broke the news of the episode to Kate, Kip and Rebekah. Filming an entire episode with no other cast is a big call in fast-moving serial television. However, all three embraced the challenge and delivered some of their best performances ever.\" \n\nGamblin was grateful to the producers for trusting that he, Elmaloglou and Kendall could carry such an important episode. He told Sarah Ellis from \"Inside Soap\" \"Usually we get three or four scenes, so to have a whole episode to ourselves was good – even though there were a lot of lines to learn!\" Kendall expressed her amazement that a three-hander had not been done before, but believed the love triangle was the perfect storyline to use the style. She felt excited about the script when she received it and branded the plot \"really interesting\". Kendall told Carena Crawford of \"All About Soap\" that it was a challenge to find the much needed depth and subtlety for the scenes. \"Episode 7202\" was preceded by an online bonus scene called \"Before Dawn\", which featured Brad and Lauren discussing their feelings for each other after they had sex.\n\nGamblin admitted that he was not surprised to learn Brad and Lauren would finally give into their feelings for one another. He believed many fans of the show had wanted Brad and Lauren to get together from the moment the Turner and Willis families arrived in 2013. Ellis observed that it was \"inevitable\" that they would reunite at some point. Brad and Terese's marriage was tested multiple times, but things came to a head when Terese's alcoholism and Brad's lack of sensitivity to her feelings began affecting their children. After Brad and Lauren's one-night stand, Gamblin said Brad felt guilty, but he also wanted to be honest and tell Terese to \"minimise the damage\". Elmaloglou thought the consequences of the episode would be felt for a long time afterwards, and that some \"interesting dynamics\" would also develop between the families.\n\nThe episode was filmed in early June 2015. Gamblin described the filming schedule as \"pretty busy\", while Elmaloglou called it \"a real collaborative effort\". For the scene in which Terese throws a jam jar at Brad, Elmaloglou was told to aim for Gamblin's head and he would get out of the way. Gamblin said that if he had failed to duck in time, she would have hit him across the face. The actors had two chances to get the take right as there were only two jam jars available for the scene. Kendall told an \"Inside Soap\" columnist that the stunt where Terese pushes Lauren in the pool could only be shot once, as it would take too long to dry out their hair and clothes. She explained \"so we knew what the money shot was, and worked everything else up towards that.\" Kendall and Elmaloglou were unable to hear Eames call out \"cut\", so they continued \"really going at it\" resulting in the final take.\n\n\"Episode 7202\" was watched by 222,000 Australian viewers upon its first airing, making \"Neighbours\" the tenth highest rated show on digital multi-channels that night. This was an increase of 25,000 viewers from the previous nights episode. Upon its broadcast in the UK on 15 September, the episode was seen by 764,000 viewers at 1.45pm and 597,000 at 5.30pm, an increase on the previous days episode.\n\nHerbison received the Best Script for a Television Serial accolade at the 2016 AWGIE Awards. Television critic Melinda Houston of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" praised the episode, saying \"it's an ambitious move for both the writer and actors – and it really works.\" She gave it three and a half stars out of five. A reporter for the same publication branded the episode \"special\" and observed that \"both the script and the performers are tested when the whole half-hour is given over to one storyline and three players\". They singled out Kendall's performance as being particularity good, saying she \"delivers scenes that transcend the genre.\" \n\nKnox (TV Tonight) noted that the actor's \"commitment together with the unique approach is what separates this from other episodes. Fans will doubtless look back on this as one of the more memorable stories.\" Katie Baillie from the \"Metro\" branded the episode \"dark and tense\". Michael Cregan of \"Inside Soap\" included the episode in his \"5 top soap moments\" feature when it aired in the UK. Carena Crawford of \"All About Soap\" dubbed it a \"landmark episode\". While a \"Soap World\" reporter named it \"Best Special Episode\" during their feature on the highs and lows of soap operas in 2015. The reporter wrote that the \"tense and gripping scenes\" kept viewers watching.\n"}

It is based on a rejection of the tenets and techniques of classical Hollywood cinema.\n\nEuropean art cinema gained popularity in the 1960s, with notable filmmakers such as Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, and Ingmar Bergman. At this time it was new to the even broader field of art cinema.\n\nThe continuity editing system is not necessarily abandoned but instead is not \"needed\". The cause and effect driven narrative, as well as the goal-oriented protagonist are also not needed. Instead, we may have the protagonist wander around aimlessly for the whole movie, with nothing of real importance happening to drive him from one activity to the other.\n\nClassical Hollywood cinema has a narrative transitivity, in which there is \"a sequence of events in which each unit follows the one preceding it according to a chain of causation; this chain is usually psychological\". The 'tale over teller' mantra of the classical Hollywood cinema is closely linked to the editing form that classical Hollywood cinema takes, and the rules they impose. For example, the 180 degree rule is followed since crossing the 180 degree line will cause a disturbance or a jarring effect on the viewer, thus calling attention away from story and to the teller. Jump cuts are avoided, since they can cause an ellipsis of the spatial or temporal kind. It is the job of classical Hollywood cinema to get the audience lost and absorbed into the story of the film, so that the film is pleasurable. In contrast the task of European art cinema is to be ambiguous, utilizing an open-ended (and sometimes intertextual) plot, causing the audience to ask questions themselves whilst introducing an element of subjectivity.\n\nAnother way they differ in terms of ‘realism’ is that Hollywood classical cinema has characters in full make up all the time, even when just coming out of bed; whereas European art cinema strives for a representation of the 'truth' and may not have characters in costume or make up.\n\n\n"}

Its remit covers arcades, betting, bingo, casinos, slot machines and lotteries, as well as remote gambling, but not spread betting. \n\nThe stated aims of the Commission are to keep crime out of gambling, and to protect the vulnerable. It issues licences to operators, and advises the government on gambling-related issues. It also collaborates with the police over suspected illegal gambling.\nThe Commission replaced the Gaming Board for Great Britain in 2007. In 2013 it assumed responsibility for regulating the National Lottery.\n\nThe Gambling Commission was established under the Gambling Act 2005 and assumed full powers in 2007, taking over responsibility from the Gaming Board for Great Britain, in regulating arcades, betting, bingo, casinos, slot machines and lotteries, but not spread betting (regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority). The Commission is a non-departmental public body, sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nIt is also responsible for the remote gambling which includes betting online, by telephone and other communication devices using the equipment, based on the territory of Great Britain.\n\nOn 1 October 2013 the National Lottery Commission, which regulated the National Lottery, became part of the Gambling Commission.\n\nThe Commission's stated aims are \"to keep crime out of gambling, to ensure that gambling is conducted fairly and openly, and to protect children and vulnerable people\". However, critics note its ADR process and default non-disclosure of complaints as often part of \"standard procedure\" contrasts directly with the validity of this claimed remit.\n\nThe Commission released a new 2018/19 business plan with the goals of improving industry standards, consumer protections and to further public protection from gambling related harm. \n\nThe Commission issues licences to gambling operators, can levy fines and revoke licences, and is tasked with investigating and prosecuting illegal gambling. It is also responsible for advising national and local government on gambling-related issues.\n\nFor remote gambling, the Commission issues licences to those operators whose remote gambling equipment is located in the territory of Great Britain. Whilst, those operators who wish to advertise their services in England, Wales, or Scotland, but are based outside the country, have to obtain a licence from the Gambling Commission following the passage of the Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Act 2014. The 2014 Act changed the licensing requirements so that any company wishing to advertise gambling and take bets from consumers in England, Wales, or Scotland must hold a licence issued by the Gambling Commission. Previously, an operator in one of the whitelisted gambling jurisdictions could advertise their services in Great Britain without requiring a separate license from the Commission. The proposals were opposed by the gambling industry, including the Gibraltar Betting and Gaming Association.\n\nThe list of responsibilities of the Gambling Commission includes work to ensure that licensees act in accordance with the requirements imposed by the Gambling Act 2005 and other related regulations and standards. The Commission has the right to visit its licensees and examine their financial activities. As a result of this examination, specialists from the Gambling Commission can issue recommendations for amendments. Apart from such advice, supplementary licence conditions can be set or removed. In some cases, the Commission may take action to correct or avoid certain misconducts.\n\nApart from reviewing the activities of the licensed operators, the Commission is authorised to take regulatory actions against those licensees who breach the rules in some way. The range of actions that may need to be taken varies from issuing a warning to inflicting a fine on those who violate licence conditions. In situations where additional investigation is required, the licence can be revoked.\n\nThe Intelligence department of the Gambling Commission collects information about the illegal activities related to their field and conducts preliminary investigation to build a picture of the situation and inform senior management.They also collaborate with other UK organisations and the police in cases where suspicious betting or gambling activities are detected.\n\nThe list of operators and personal licence holders who have had a regulatory sanction imposed on them is published on the site of the Gambling Commission.\n\nIn February 2018, the Commission fined British bookmaker William Hill £6.2 million for not protecting players after a series of systematic failures to prevent money laundering. \n\nIn May 2018, the Commission issued a £600,000 penalty to LeoVegas for producing misleading adverts to customers as well as several self-exclusion failings.\n\nIn June 2018, the Commission fined 32Red £2 million for failing a problem gambler who had deposited £758,000 with 32Red over more than two years. 32Red had failed to check the customer, who had a net income of £2,150 per month, could afford the bets despite several previous regulatory rulings in this area.\n\nThe Gambling Commission has come under fire for not preventing the spread of Fixed odds betting terminals on the high street. Their spread is linked to the transfer of responsibility for planning permission for bookmakers moving from the Gambling Commission to local authorities.\n\nIn 2014, the UK-regulated online bookmaker Canbet went into receivership, owing millions to customers. The demise of this site raised questions of the ability of the Commission to protect UK customers from rogue traders, although overall responsibility for UK online regulation was only given to the UKGC in November 2014.\n\nIn September 2014, UK-regulated online bookmaker BetButler closed down, leaving a message on its website reading \"The Board of BetButler Limited has been approached by a third party regulated gaming business to acquire the customer database, including all balances and pending withdrawal requests, of the business. This process will take some days to complete.\" Concerns were raised about pay out times and their financial state many months before this appeared. Again, the Gambling Commission have been criticised.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7804447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7804447", "title": "Gambling mathematics", "text": "Gambling mathematics\n\nThe mathematics of gambling are a collection of probability applications encountered in games of chance and can be included in game theory. From a mathematical point of view, the games of chance are experiments generating various types of aleatory events, the probability of which can be calculated by using the properties of probability on a finite space of events.\n\nThe technical processes of a game stand for experiments that generate aleatory events. Here are a few examples:\n\nA probability model starts from an experiment and a mathematical structure attached to that experiment, namely the space (field) of events. The event is the main unit probability theory works on. In gambling, there are many categories of events, all of which can be textually predefined. In the previous examples of gambling experiments we saw some of the events that experiments generate. They are a minute part of all possible events, which in fact is the\nset of all parts of the sample space.\n\nFor a specific game, the various types of events can be:\n\nEach category can be further divided into several other subcategories, depending on the game referred to. These events can be literally defined, but it must be done very carefully when framing a probability problem. From a mathematical point of view, the events are nothing more than subsets and the space of events is a Boolean algebra. Among these events, we find elementary and compound events, exclusive and nonexclusive events, and independent and non-independent events.\n\nIn the experiment of rolling a die:\n\nIn the experiment of dealing the pocket cards in Texas Hold’em Poker:\nThese are a few examples of gambling events, whose properties of compoundness, exclusiveness and independency are easily observable. These\nproperties are very important in practical probability calculus.\n\nThe complete mathematical model is given by the probability field attached to the experiment, which is the triple \"sample space—field of events—probability function\". For any game of chance, the probability model is of the simplest type—the sample space is finite, the space of events is the set of parts of the sample space, implicitly finite, too, and the probability function is given by the definition of probability on a finite space of events:\n\nGames of chance are also good examples of combinations, permutations and arrangements, which are met at every step: combinations of cards in a player’s hand, on the table or expected in any card game; combinations of numbers when rolling several dice once; combinations of numbers in lottery and bingo; combinations of symbols in slots; permutations and arrangements in a race to be bet on, and the like. Combinatorial calculus is an important part of gambling probability applications. In games of chance, most of the gambling probability calculus in which we use the classical definition of probability reverts to counting combinations. The gaming events can be identified with sets, which often are sets of combinations. Thus, we can identify an event with a combination.\n\nFor example, in a five draw poker game, the event \"at least one player holds a four of a kind formation\" can be identified with the set of all combinations of (xxxxy) type, where \"x\" and \"y\" are distinct values of cards. This set has 13C(4,4)(52-4)=624 combinations. Possible combinations are (3♠ 3♣ 3♥ 3♦ J♣) or (7♠ 7♣ 7♥ 7♦ 2♣). These can be identified with elementary events that the event to be measured consists of.\n\nGames of chance are not merely pure applications of probability calculus and gaming situations are not just isolated events whose numerical probability is well established through mathematical methods; they are also games whose progress is influenced by human action. In gambling, the human element has a striking character. The player is not only interested in the mathematical probability of the various gaming events, but he or she has expectations from the games while a major interaction exists. To obtain favorable results from this interaction, gamblers take into account all possible information, including statistics, to build gaming strategies. The predicted average gain or loss is called \"expectation\" or expected value and is the sum of the probability of each possible outcome of the experiment multiplied by its payoff (value). Thus, it represents the average amount one expects to win per bet if bets with identical odds are repeated many times. A game or situation in which the expected value for the player is zero (no net gain nor loss) is called a \"fair game. \"The attribute \"fair \"refers not to the technical process of the game, but to the chance balance house (bank)–player.\n\nEven though the randomness inherent in games of chance would seem to ensure their fairness (at least with respect to the players around a table—shuffling a deck or spinning a wheel do not favor any player except if they are fraudulent), gamblers always search and wait for irregularities in this randomness that will allow them to win. It has been mathematically proved that, in ideal conditions of randomness, and with negative expectation, no long-run regular winning is possible for players of games of chance. Most gamblers accept this premise, but still work on strategies to make them win either in the short term or over the long run.\n\nCasino games provide a predictable long-term advantage to the casino, or \"house\", while offering the player the possibility of a large short-term payout. Some casino games have a skill element, where the player makes decisions; such games are called \"random with a tactical element.\" While it is possible through skilful play to minimize the house advantage, it is extremely rare that a player has sufficient skill to completely eliminate his inherent long-term disadvantage (the house edge or house vigorish) in a casino game. Common belief is that such a skill set would involve years of training, an extraordinary memory and numeracy, and/or acute visual or even aural observation, as in the case of wheel clocking in Roulette. For more examples see Advantage gambling.\n\nThe player's disadvantage is a result of the casino not paying winning wagers according to the game's \"true odds\", which are the payouts that would be expected considering the odds of a wager either winning or losing. For example, if a game is played by wagering on the number that would result from the roll of one die, true odds would be 5 times the amount wagered since there is a 1/6 probability of any single number appearing. However, the casino may only pay 4 times the amount wagered for a winning wager.\n\nThe house edge (HE) or vigorish is defined as the casino profit expressed as a percentage of the player's original bet. In games such as Blackjack or Spanish 21, the final bet may be several times the original bet, if the player doubles or splits.\n\nExample: In American Roulette, there are two zeroes and 36 non-zero numbers (18 red and 18 black). If a player bets $1 on red, his chance of winning $1 is therefore 18/38 and his chance of losing $1 (or winning -$1) is 20/38.\n\nThe player's expected value, EV = (18/38 x 1) + (20/38 x -1) = 18/38 - 20/38 = -2/38 = -5.26%. Therefore, the house edge is 5.26%. After 10 rounds, play $1 per round, the average house profit will be 10 x $1 x 5.26% = $0.53.\nOf course, it is not possible for the casino to win exactly 53 cents; this figure is the average casino profit from each player if it had millions of players each betting 10 rounds at $1 per round.\n\nThe house edge of casino games vary greatly with the game. Keno can have house edges up to 25%, slot machines can have up to 15%, while most Australian Pontoon games have house edges between 0.3% and 0.4%.\n\nThe calculation of the Roulette house edge was a trivial exercise; for other games, this is not usually the case. Combinatorial analysis and/or computer simulation is necessary to complete the task.\n\nIn games which have a skill element, such as Blackjack or Spanish 21, the house edge is defined as the house advantage from optimal play (without the use of advanced techniques such as card counting or shuffle tracking), on the first hand of the shoe (the container that holds the cards). The set of the optimal plays for all possible hands is known as \"basic strategy\" and is highly dependent on the specific rules, and even the number of decks used. Good Blackjack and Spanish 21 games have house edges below 0.5%.\n\nOnline slot games often have a published Return to Player (RTP) percentage that determines the theoretical house edge. Some software developers choose to publish the RTP of their slot games while others do not. Despite the set theoretical RTP, almost any outcome is possible in the short term.\n\nThe luck factor in a casino game is quantified using standard deviation (SD). The standard deviation of a simple game like Roulette can be simply calculated because of the binomial distribution of successes (assuming a result of 1 unit for a win, and 0 units for a loss). For the binomial distribution, SD is equal to formula_1, where formula_2 is the number of rounds played, formula_3 is the probability of winning, and formula_4 is the probability of losing. Furthermore, if we flat bet at 10 units per round instead of 1 unit, the range of possible outcomes increases 10 fold. Therefore, SD for Roulette even-money bet is equal to formula_5, where formula_6 is the flat bet per round, formula_2 is the number of rounds, formula_8, and formula_9.\n\nAfter enough large number of rounds the theoretical distribution of the total win converges to the normal distribution, giving a good possibility to forecast the possible win or loss. For example, after 100 rounds at $1 per round, the standard deviation of the win (equally of the loss) will be formula_10. After 100 rounds, the expected loss will be formula_11.\n\nThe 3 sigma range is six times the standard deviation: three above the mean, and three below. Therefore, after 100 rounds betting $1 per round, the result will very probably be somewhere between formula_12 and formula_13, i.e., between -$34 and $24. There is still a ca. 1 to 400 chance that the result will be not in this range, i.e. either the win will exceed $24, or the loss will exceed $34.\n\nThe standard deviation for the even-money Roulette bet is one of the lowest out of all casinos games. Most games, particularly slots, have extremely high standard deviations. As the size of the potential payouts increase, so does the standard deviation.\n\nUnfortunately, the above considerations for small numbers of rounds are incorrect, because the distribution is far from normal. Moreover, the results of more volatile games usually converge to the normal distribution much more slowly, therefore much more huge number of rounds are required for that.\n\nAs the number of rounds increases, eventually, the expected loss will exceed the standard deviation, many times over. From the formula, we can see the standard deviation is proportional to the square root of the number of rounds played, while the expected loss is proportional to the number of rounds played. As the number of rounds increases, the expected loss increases at a much faster rate. This is why it is practically impossible for a gambler to win in the long term (if they don't have an edge). It is the high ratio of short-term standard deviation to expected loss that fools gamblers into thinking that they can win.\n\nThe volatility index (VI) is defined as the standard deviation for one round, betting one unit. Therefore, the VI for the even-money American Roulette bet is formula_14.\n\nThe variance formula_15 is defined as the square of the VI. Therefore, the variance of the even-money American Roulette bet is ca. 0.249, which is extremely low for a casino game. The variance for Blackjack is ca. 1.2, which is still low compared to the variances of electronic gaming machines (EGMs).\n\nAdditionally, the term of the volatility index based on some confidence intervals are used. Usually, it is based on the 90% confidence interval. The volatility index for the 90% confidence interval is ca. 1.645 times as the \"usual\" volatility index that relates to the ca. 68.27% confidence interval.\n\nIt is important for a casino to know both the house edge and volatility index for all of their games. The house edge tells them what kind of profit they will make as percentage of turnover, and the volatility index tells them how much they need in the way of cash reserves. The mathematicians and computer programmers that do this kind of work are called gaming mathematicians and gaming analysts. Casinos do not have in-house expertise in this field, so they outsource their requirements to experts in the gaming analysis field.\n\n\n\n"}

Since various definite film genres—including science fiction, film noir, thriller, and comedy—have used Gothic elements, the Gothic film is challenging to define clearly as a genre. Gothic elements have also infused the horror film genre, contributing supernatural and nightmarish elements. To create a Gothic atmosphere, filmmakers have sought to create new camera tricks that challenge audiences' perceptions. Gothic films also reflected contemporary issues. \"A New Companion to The Gothic\"s Heidi Kaye said \"strong visuals, a focus on sexuality and an emphasis on audience response\" characterize Gothic films like they did the literary works. \"The Encyclopedia of the Gothic\" said the foundation of Gothic film was the combination of Gothic literature, stage melodrama, and German expressionism.\n\nIn \"The Cambridge Companion to Gothic Fiction\", Misha Kavka says Gothic film is not an established genre, rather contributing Gothic images, plots, characters, and styles to films. These elements are often found in \"the broader category of \"horror\"\". Kavka quotes William Patrick Day's definition of the Gothic, \"[it] tantalizes us with fear, both as its subject and its effect; its does so, however, not primarily through characters or plots or even language, but through \"spectacle\"\". Cinema suits the Gothic definition in creating images that establish the spectacle.\n\nGothic films were part of early cinema, adapting Gothic fiction on screen like stage melodramas had previously done. Gothic works that strongly influenced cinema were those from the 19th century: \"Frankenstein\" by Mary Shelley, \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" by Robert Louis Stevenson, and \"Dracula\" by Bram Stoker. Like most early cinema, many silent Gothic films were lost or very short. In the aftermath of World War I, the horrors of war pervaded Gothic films. Robert Wiene's \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1920), though not based on a Gothic text, exhibited German Expressionism that Heidi Kaye said \"transformed the American approach to Gothic cinema\". \"The Encyclopedia of the Gothic\" said \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" became a \"milestone in Gothic film\".\n\nAccording to \"New Directions in 21st-Century Gothic: The Gothic Compass\", scholars consider the Gothic films \"Frankenstein\" (1931) by James Whale, \"Dracula\" (1931) by Tod Browning, and \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" (1931) by Rouben Mamoulian \"a foundational triptych, from which they in turn look back to earlier Gothic films and forward to later ones\".\n\nIn Australia, the first modern Gothic film is considered to be \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" (1975).\n\nWhen the British Film Institute in 2013 launched a program celebrating films and TV shows with Gothic themes, \"The Guardian\" identified the following as the ten best Gothic films (ordered by year):\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1936 by Eddie Shipstad, Roy Shipstad, and Oscar Johnson, who also skated in the show. In later years, Olympic skaters such as Donald Jackson, Barbara Berezowski, Peggy Fleming, and Janet Lynn were in the cast. Ice Follies also featured novelty acts such as Frick and Frack and Richard Dwyer, who was billed as \"Mr. Debonair\".\n\nThe production company is now called Ice Follies and Holiday on Ice, Inc., a subsidiary of Feld Entertainment which produces the shows under the Disney on Ice and \"... on Ice\" titles. Feld formed the new subsidiary from the Ice Follies and U.S. Holiday on Ice touring companies.\n\nThe show was a variety show that included a chorus line called The Ice Folliettes, which led to synchronized figure skating, that famously precisely performed a kick line and pinwheel on ice.\n\nIce Follies produced the first large scale, professional touring show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on . Ice Follies was featured in the Joan Crawford film, \"The Ice Follies of 1939\", MGM's answer to the popular Sonja Henie films of the time. Frick and Frack, the comic skating duo, joined the show in the 1939.\n\nIn 1946, Ice Follies began co-producing Ice Cycles with Ice Capades. In 1949, Ice Follies left the Ice Cycles show, leaving it under Ice Capades' ownership. In 1950, Roy Shipstad retired from performing and recruited Richard Dwyer to take over his role of \"Debonair\" as the \"Young Debonair\". By 1966, \"Young\" was dropped from the role title that later became \"Mr. Debonair\". Frack became ill in 1954 ending the duo, but Frick continued at Ice Follies with other partners.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Thomas Scallen took an executive position with Ice Follies which he eventually bought in 1964. The Ice Follies were placed within General Ice Shows, Inc., a subsidiary of Scallen's Medical Investment Corporation. General Shows purchased Holiday on Ice (HoI) by . After lawsuits filed by HoI's Chaffen and Arthur Wirtz were resolved in August 1971 and February 1976 respectively, Wirtz gained ownership of both shows.\nMattel's Irvin & Kenneth Feld Productions purchased the Ice Follies and the Holiday on Ice from Wirtz for $12 million in 1979. The company soon approached Disney about doing a Disney-related show on ice.\n\nIce Follies merged with Holiday on Ice in 1980, operating as a combined show in 1980 and 1981. The first \"Disney's World on Ice\" began touring in 1981. Frick suffered a career ending injury in 1980.\n\nIn 1995, the company branched out from \"Disney's World on Ice\" with \"The Wizard of Oz on Ice\", the first of the Classic Ice Spectaculars. Disney's World on Ice launched its first international tour in 1986 starting in Japan, had five different touring units by 1988, and changed its name in 1998 to \"Disney on Ice\". The first ice show done in conjunction with 20th Century Fox was \"Anastasia On Ice\" starting in 1998.\n\nIce Follies also expanded to perform \"Grease on Ice\" as early as 1999. Based on the Disney Channel original movie, \"High School Musical\" was launched as an ice tour in 2006 and lasted three years, despite having been originally expected to last one year.\n\n"}

Tolkien's Riders of Rohan is a computer video game from 1991 based upon the fictional War of the Ring set in the Middle-earth world created by J. R. R. Tolkien, centered in the Lord of the Rings novels. The massive-scale simulation takes part in the realm of Rohan and the player controls the forces of Good during the onslaught of the forces of Evil, namely centered on the conflict with Saruman of Isengard. It was published by Konami and Mirrorsoft.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it is very similar to the 1988 \"War in Middle Earth\", except the setting was downsized from the entire world just to the land of the Rohirrim, engulfing mostly the storyline from \"The Two Towers\", and to a small extent ending in \"The Return of the King\". In a combination of a single-unit adventure, small-scale battlefield tactics and broadscale campaign warfare, the player must coordinate the Fellowship and Rohan's troops in order to fend of the invasion of Saruman's Orcs and save the Rohirrim lands, as well as mounting enough forces to push the war on the fronts in the east in order to contribute to Sauron's defeat.\n\nAt the beginning, the player can in the starting menu choose to start a new game, load an old one, quit, access encyclopedias dealing with featured units and characters, or practice. The practice folds down to tutorials in single-fighter combat:\n- Archery: the player takes control of Legolas attempting to shoot down (18) Orcs from a wall, while crouching from their spears\n- Duel: the player chooses between four Heroes: Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Eomer, to fight either an Orc or a Dunlending in melee combat\n- Magic Duel: the player takes control over Gandalf fighting a Nazgul flying mounted on a Felbeast\n\nThe game begins just before the Battles at the Fords of Isen, with the player taking control over Rohan's western armies (an army consisted of an infantry unit [Westfold Militia], a light cavalry unit [Outriders], a horse archers unit [Harrowdale Bow] and three heave cavalry units [Helms Deep Guards and Edoras Guards, the Grimslade squadron being under Theodred's personal leadership]). The main army is led by Theodred, while there is a separate unit of heavy cavalry [Harrowdale] that is still behind on the road. The game ends when Sauron is destroyed after the Battle at the Black Gates and Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom.\n\nThe player can control only the good side in the conflict.\n\nThe game features a number of characters, only conditionally \"heroes\": \n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" called the game's graphics \"simple, yet pleasing\", but described it as \"a lightweight strategy game that includes several action sequences and some very limited character interaction\". The magazine stated that those who had not read Tolkien's books would likely not understand the game's backstory, and that strategy players would dislike how closely they needed to follow the original story's actions to succeed in the game. \"Computer Gaming World\" only recommended it to devoted Tolkien fans.\n\n\n"}

Those on this list appeared at least once on the American vaudeville stage during its heyday between 1881 and 1932. The source in the citation included with each entry confirms their appearance and cites information in the performance notes section.\n\nVaudeville is a style of variety entertainment predominant in North America and Australasia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A similar development in Britain was known as Music Hall. Developing from many sources, including shows in saloons, minstrelsy, freak shows, dime museums, British pantomimes, and other popular forms of entertainment, vaudeville became one of the most popular types of entertainment in America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Vaudeville took the form of a series of separate, usually unrelated acts each featuring a different types of performance. These performances could ranges from musicians (both classical and popular), dancers, comedians, animal acts, magicians, female and male impersonators, to acrobats, one-act plays or scenes from plays, athletes lecturing celebrities, minstrels, or even short films.\n\nWhile the initial origins of vaudeville are obscure, historians acknowledge that the opening of Tony Pastor's Fourteenth Street Theatre in New York City on October 24, 1881, marks the beginning of American vaudeville. Pastor had refined the rough variety acts into something wholesome enough for women and children. Other theatre owners quickly picked up on Pastor's new style of vaudeville and theatres began springing up like weeds and would continue in a quick pace until the 1920s. In Australasia vaudeville companies such as Fuller's became household names, eventually operating in several Australian and New Zealand cities at once. Vaudeville reached its height around 1915. These heights included an industrialization of the business of vaudeville. Following this climax, vaudeville began to struggle with competition from film and in the following decade, radio. These mediums competed not only for audiences, but talent as well. Towards the end of the 1920s, vaudeville theatres began to be converted to cinemas or closed altogether with entire circuits. After the blow dealt the world by the economic downturn of the Great Depression, vaudeville's pulse quickly weakened. Just as historians mark the date of the \"birth\" of vaude, the date of its death is marked as well. New York's Palace Theatre on Broadway, was the palace of vaudeville; a place where only the greatest of vaude's performers performed. On November 16, 1932, the last vaudeville bill was played there and the Palace became a full-time movie house. Vaudeville did continue to struggle on, but it never again reached the heights attained in 1915.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2933388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2933388", "title": "Mass Effect (video game)", "text": "Mass Effect (video game)\n\nMass Effect is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Microsoft Game Studios and Electronic Arts. Originally released for the Xbox 360 video game console in 2007, it is the first game of the \"Mass Effect\" series. The game takes place within the Milky Way galaxy in the year 2183, where civilization is threatened by a highly advanced machine race known as the Reapers. The player assumes the role of Commander Shepard, an elite human soldier who must stop a rogue agent from carrying out the Reapers' galactic invasion. The gameplay requires the player to complete multiple quests that generally involve space exploration, squad and vehicular combat, and interaction with non-player characters.\n\nPlanned as the first chapter of a trilogy from the very beginning, \"Mass Effect\" was developed over the course of three and a half years and uses the Unreal Engine 3 as a groundwork. It was designed so that the player would assume the role of a central character that could make important decisions and impact the story of the game in numerous ways. The combat was designed to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and real-time third-person shooter interface. In 2008 and 2009, two downloadable content packs that introduced new missions to the base game were released.\n\n\"Mass Effect\" received critical acclaim from video game publications and sold more than one and a half million copies by January 2008. Critics praised the game's interactive storytelling and cinematic design, but criticized its unbalanced combat mechanics and poor artificial intelligence. The game received several year-end awards, including Best RPG at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards and Roleplaying Game of the Year at the 2008 Interactive Achievement Awards. \"Mass Effect\" was ported to the Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3 platforms in 2008 and 2012, respectively. A sequel, \"Mass Effect 2\", was released in 2010.\n\n\"Mass Effect\" is a single-player action role-playing game in which the player takes the role of Commander Shepard from a third-person perspective. Shepard's gender, appearance, military background, combat-training and first name are determined by the player before the game begins. There are six different character classes for the player to choose from and each of them have different talents that provide enhanced combat capabilities. For example, the Soldier class is trained in weapon damage and has improved health, while the Sentinel class is trained in protecting and healing allies. At one point in the game, players may evolve their base class talent into one of two specializations, which depend on the class chosen by the player. Although any class can use any weapon type, each class is only effective with the weapons they are trained in.\n\nThe game's overworld is a galaxy map that the player can explore to find and complete quests. Most of the quests that progress the story consist of combat missions, while optional quests generally involve the player gathering items or interacting with non-player characters. As the player progresses throughout the game, six squad members become available, each with their own talents that can be developed. Experience points are gained in multiple ways, such as completing quests, defeating enemies, or finding and collecting items around the environment. Each time a sufficient amount of experience is obtained, the player \"levels up\" and is awarded a number of Talent Points that can be used to develop talents for both Shepard and the members of the squad. Each talent has 12 ranks that can be unlocked, with each rank costing one Talent Point.\n\nThe player's primary mode of transportation is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, buy new equipment, and travel to numerous planetary systems. Although the game features a large number of planets for the player to examine, only a few of them can actually be landed on and explored. Some of them can also be surveyed to search for valuable resources and quest-relevant items. Upon landing on a planet, the player can traverse on foot or by using an all-terrain infantry fighting vehicle called the M35 Mako. Most of the game's main quests are geared toward on-foot combat, but some segments may feature combat requiring the use of the M35 Mako. In contrast, secondary quests usually require the player to explore free-roam uncharted worlds with the vehicle. Equipment items, which include armor, weapon, and ammunition upgrades, can be found around the environment or purchased from merchants in settlements.\n\nCombat in \"Mass Effect\" is squad-based and two squad members accompany the player on the battlefield. The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Battles take place in real-time, but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different talent abilities for the squad members to use. The game uses an over the shoulder perspective akin to a third-person shooter, and features a cover system which allows players to strategically hide behind objects while fighting enemy forces. The player may also issue orders to the squad members, such as sending them to take cover behind an object, scout ahead, regroup, or focus their fire on a designed target.\n\nWeapons range from pistols to shotguns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. Although all of them have unlimited ammunition, they overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. In addition, the player can use grenades which latch onto targets or flat surfaces to be remotely detonated. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a health bar and damage-absorbing shields. The health bar only takes damage once the shields have been destroyed, but environmental hazards like heat or toxic agents may directly affect the health bar if they are not negated entirely by wearing appropriate armor. The health bar can be restored with the use of items called Medi-gels, while shields automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. Some talents and equipment items can improve the healing rate or shield regeneration. The player can revive fallen squad members with the use of the Unity talent. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.\n\nDuring conversations with characters, \"Mass Effect\" employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's dialogue options depend on wheel direction. The left side of the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard and affect the player's chosen morality. Morality is measured by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points allow the player to develop talents that affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game.\n\n\"Mass Effect\" is set within the Milky Way galaxy in the year 2183 where interstellar travel is possible through the use of mass transit devices called Mass Relays, a technology believed to have been built by an extinct alien race known as the Protheans. The term \"Mass Effect\" is defined as a form of mass-negating technology, allowing the creation of physics phenomena, like artificial gravity or FTL travel. A conglomerate body of governments known as the Citadel Council controls a large percentage of the galaxy and is responsible for maintaining law and order among races of the galactic community. Races that belong to the Citadel Council include humans, asari, salarians, and turians. Other alien races seen in the game include the reptilian krogan, the environmental suited quarians, and a hostile race of networked artificial intelligences called geth. Humanity is represented by the Systems Alliance, an organized body that joined the galactic community in 2157.\n\nThe protagonist of the game is Commander Shepard (voiced by Mark Meer or Jennifer Hale), a graduate of the Systems Alliance special forces program and a candidate to become the first human member of the Special Tactics and Reconnaissance (Spectre) force, agents given broad authority by the Citadel Council to protect the galaxy. Shepard's squad members include human Systems Alliance marine Kaidan Alenko (Raphael Sbarge), human Systems Alliance soldier Ashley Williams (Kimberly Brooks), turian Citadel Security officer Garrus Vakarian (Brandon Keener), krogan mercenary Urdnot Wrex (Steven Barr), quarian mechanic Tali'Zorah (Ash Sroka), and asari exoarchaeologist Liara T'Soni (Ali Hillis). Other characters include \"SSV Normandy\" captain David Anderson (Keith David) and \"SSV Normandy\"s pilot Jeff \"Joker\" Moreau (Seth Green).\n\nShepard and Kaidan are sent to the human colony of Eden Prime to recover an unearthed Prothean beacon. They repel an attack by the geth, rescuing Ashley in the process. Rogue turian Spectre, Saren Arterius, activates the beacon before escaping. Shepard reaches the beacon and receives a vision showing scenes of war and death. The \"SSV Normandy\" and its crew are summoned by Ambassador Donnel Udina to the Citadel Station, but Shepard is unable to convince the Citadel Council of Saren's treason without solid evidence. Shepard meets Garrus and Wrex, and rescues Tali, who possesses a recording of a conversation between Saren and asari Matriarch, Benezia. The two discuss their victory while also mentioning an artifact called the \"Conduit\" and the return of the Reapers, a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships believed to eradicate all organic civilization every 50,000 years. The Council revokes Saren's Spectre status and makes Shepard the first human Spectre. Shepard is also handed command of the \"Normandy\" by Anderson, and begins to follow several leads provided by him and Udina.\n\nOn the world of Therum, Shepard rescues Benezia's daughter Liara T'Soni, who joins Shepard's squad because of her biotic abilities and expertise of the Protheans. On the colony of Feros, Shepard fights off Saren's forces and learns that his flagship, Sovereign, possesses unique mind-control capabilities. On the world of Noveria, Shepard tracks down and defeats Benezia, who reveals that she and Saren are being indoctrinated by Sovereign. Meanwhile, the Council informs Shepard that a salarian infiltration unit has uncovered Saren's main base on Virmire. Upon arrival, Shepard learns that Saren has discovered a cure for the krogan genetic disease, the genophage, and plans to breed an army of unstoppable krogan warriors. Wrex clashes with Shepard over whether to destroy it, which results in him either standing down or being executed. After this conflict, Shepard assists the salarians in destroying the base by planting a bomb in it. Inside, Shepard is confronted by Sovereign, who reveals itself to be an actual Reaper.\n\nSovereign reveals that the Reapers remain outside the Milky Way waiting for organic life to develop and discover the Mass Relays, before harvesting them when they reach their peak. Afterwards, Shepard must choose between saving Ashley or Kaidan, who have both been pinned down with the bomb about to explode. Shepard also finds Saren, who claims that his allegiance to Sovereign will save organic life forms by demonstrating their usefulness to the Reapers. Liara is then able to pinpoint the Conduit's location back on the \"Normandy\": a Prothean world known as Ilos. There, Shepard learns that the Citadel Station is actually a huge Mass Relay that the Reapers use to invade the galaxy. During the last extinction cycle, a few Protheans survived on Ilos via cryopreservation and then re-entered the Citadel Station via the Conduit, a reverse-engineered miniature Mass Relay disguised aboard the station as a statue. The Protheans sabotaged the Citadel to prevent the Reapers from remotely activating the Citadel Mass Relay, which Saren plans to undo to allow Sovereign to trigger the Reaper invasion.\n\nAfter fighting through heavy geth forces at the Conduit, Shepard confronts Saren at the Citadel. Saren is either killed by Shepard or commits suicide if Shepard convinces him to rebel. The Destiny Ascension, the Citadel's flagship with the Council on board, then requests assistance; Shepard must either risk heavy human casualties to save them or sacrifice them to pursue Sovereign. Sovereign then reanimates Saren's corpse to attack Shepard, while simultaneously fighting off the Alliance. Eventually, Saren's corpse is destroyed, and Sovereign is dispatched by the \"Normandy\". For prevailing, Humanity is either invited to join the Council if it was saved, or becomes its new leader if it was left to perish. Regardless, Shepard can nominate either Anderson or Udina to this new leadership position before leaving the proceedings, vowing to end the Reaper threat.\n\n\"Mass Effect\" was developed by BioWare and directed by Casey Hudson, who previously directed BioWare's 2003 title \"\". Preproduction of the game began in early 2004, shortly after the Microsoft Windows version of \"Knights of the Old Republic\" was released. As the development team was already experienced with the Xbox console, they decided to develop the game originally for its successor, the Xbox 360, due to its improved processing power and development tools. A total of 130 people were involved in the development of the game and the first six to eight months were spent conceiving how the game would look. \"Mass Effect\" uses the Unreal Engine 3 as a groundwork, but on top of that the team developed additional components for advanced digital actors, space exploration, and squad combat, resulting in BioWare's largest programming project at the time. During the game's three- to four-year development cycle, most of the time had been devoted to the development of these technologies.\n\nAs BioWare wanted to create a big and memorable story, \"Mass Effect\" was envisioned as the first chapter of a trilogy from the very beginning, and having a considerable technological basis would help shorten the development cycle of its future sequels. Instead of designing a role-playing game where the player would control a blank protagonist, the developers wanted players to assume the role of a central character that would have to make important decisions. According to Hudson, this approach would allow them to create a unique \"level of intensity and cinematic power\", while at the same time give the player the same role-playing customization as previous BioWare games. Choices and consequences were a high priority, as developers did not want players to follow a pre-determined path. Since the game would feature a wide range of dialogue options when the player interacts with in-game characters, the team created the dialogue wheel to help players know which responses belong to which emotions. The use of digital actors allowed developers to create conversations where characters would speak by using facial expressions and body movement.\n\nHudson explained that they wanted to evolve the pseudo-turn-based combat of \"Knights of the Old Republic\" into a real-time third-person shooter interface. The combat was meant to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and more intuitive user interface. It was also designed so that players would not need to press many buttons to pull off the squad's different attack combinations. The team worked closely with Microsoft on several elements of the interface to make sure the combat was tactical enough, and went through a lot of trial and error to balance the combat between role-playing game and shooter. Creating a great sense of discovery was a major goal. Developers wanted the game to feature an actual galaxy that could be explored beyond the core story locations. Although a very large team manually built several parts of the galaxy, the tools and technologies they developed helped them extend the playable space significantly.\n\nDrew Karpyshyn, who previously served as a senior writer for \"Knights of the Old Republic\", was the lead writer for \"Mass Effect\". Despite the fact that each of the game's planets had one primary writer, all of the writers involved in the production had to review each other's work and offer criticism. This process of collaborative feedback and individual effort is common at BioWare, and it behooved Karpyshyn to make sure the style was consistent across all different areas. One of the biggest challenges the writers faced was the amount of volume they were required to write to support the game's multiple dialogue paths and story outcomes. It took them three years to get everything into the game, which featured about 400,000 words and more than 20,000 lines of spoken dialogue. According to Karpyshyn, this is roughly the equivalent of 20 movies or 4-5 full novels.\n\nFilms such as \"Star Wars\", \"Alien\", \"\", \"Blade Runner\", \"Starship Troopers\", and \"\" were major influences on the atmosphere and artistic qualities of the game. The team chose Jack Wall, who also penned the music for BioWare's 2005 title \"Jade Empire\", as the main composer of \"Mass Effect\" due to his ability to produce a wide range of musical styles. Hudson had a clear idea of what kind of music he wanted in the game, but gave Wall certain artistic freedom to express himself. According to Wall, the main vision was to \"marry the electronic instrument palatte of the late 70's/early 80's with more organic elements.\" Wall had never written this style of music before, but composer Sam Hulick helped him develop the electronic sound on a classic orchestral foundation. By the end of the project, composers Richard Jacques and David Kates joined Wall and Hulick to finish the score on time. While a total of 110 minutes of music was written for the game, all in-game and cinematic music was crafted as multiple stems to maximize their use and variety. The game went gold on October 22, 2007.\n\n\"Mass Effect\" was officially announced at the X05 trade show in Amsterdam on October 4, 2005, as an Xbox 360 exclusive. In May 2006, a demo of the game was presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and subsequently won Best Role Playing Game at the Game Critics Awards. IGN editors awarded the game for Best Graphics Technology and Most Innovative Design at their Best of E3 2006 Awards. They also listed it as one of the most anticipated games of 2007. New features of the game were detailed at the X06 trade show in Barcelona in September 2006, while the first hour of gameplay was shown at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco in March 2007. \"Mass Effect\" was then presented at E3 in July 2007, where it received Game Critics Awards for Best Console Game and Best Role Playing Game, and at the Games Convention in Leipzig, Germany in August 2007. The game's release date was announced on August 30, 2007. If the game was pre-ordered at certain retailers in Australia, players could receive a complimentary bonus disc which included a five-minute behind-the-scenes documentary, tracks from the game's soundtrack, and a number of trailers.\n\n\"Mass Effect\" was released for the Xbox 360 on November 20, 2007, in North America. However, the street date was broken in Australia on November 16, 2007, by EB Games, which received copies of the game early and took it as a sign to begin distributing. The game was released in both Standard and Limited Collector's Edition format. The Limited Collector's Edition included a bonus disc of exclusive \"Mass Effect\" background material, a soundtrack, and design galleries featuring more than 600 pieces of artwork with full audio commentaries. A soundtrack album titled \"Mass Effect Original Soundtrack\", which features 37 tracks of the game and covers a duration of 1:15:59, was released in conjunction with the game. The album includes the song \"M4 (Part II)\" by Canadian electronic rock band Faunts, which is featured in the game during the end credits.\n\nA Microsoft Windows version ported by Demiurge Studios was released on May 28, 2008. This version features optimized controls designed specifically for personal computers, high-resolution graphics, a new user interface, and other minor changes. BioWare initially intended to use SecuROM, a digital rights management software which would require online activation after installation and additional authentication checks every ten days. However, the company ultimately decided not to use it after listening to criticism from fans. In 2012, \"Mass Effect\" was ported to Sony's PlayStation 3 console by Edge of Reality, featuring lighting and visual effects improvements. It was released digitally on the PlayStation Network and as part of the \"Mass Effect Trilogy\" compilation. In 2015, \"Mass Effect\" was added to the list of backward compatible Xbox 360 games on Xbox One.\n\n\"Mass Effect\" features two downloadable content packs. The first pack, \"Bring Down the Sky\", was released as a paid download for the Xbox 360 on March 10, 2008, and as a free download for Microsoft Windows on May 28, 2008. The pack is included in the PlayStation 3 version of the game, which was released on December 4, 2012. \"Bring Down the Sky\" introduces a new mission where the player must explore an asteroid using the Mako and prevent it from striking an Earth-like planet. It also includes a new alien race and additional side-quest content. According to BioWare, the adventure takes 90 minutes to complete. Ryan Geddes of IGN highlighted the pack's included extras and \"stunning\" visuals, while Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer criticized its lack of narrative weight and reuse of outpost maps that are also available in the base game.\n\nThe second pack, \"Pinnacle Station\", was released as a paid download for the Xbox 360 and as a free download for Microsoft Windows on August 25, 2009. However, it remains absent on the PlayStation 3 version of the game. The pack introduces a training facility where the player can compete in eight virtual reality combat scenarios, divided into four different game types like Deathmatch and Capture the flag. After beating the combat scenarios, the player needs to complete four more to unlock a special survival mode, which is the same as the previous survival challenges but requires players to last five minutes. BioWare described \"Pinnacle Station\" as \"a \"Fight Club\"-style arena\" and originally intended to include a similar arena in the base game, but the idea was ultimately dropped because they were not able to do it well enough. The pack received mediocre reviews from critics, who called it uninspiring and unnecessary.\n\nUpon release, \"Mass Effect\" received critical acclaim from video game publications. The game's interactive storytelling and cinematic design were highlighted very positively, while the combat and vehicle navigation were generally seen as the game's weakest features. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot described \"Mass Effect\" as \"a great game with moments of brilliance and a number of small but significant obstacles that hold it back from reaching its true potential.\" Similarly, IGN's Erik Brudvig considered it greater than the sum of its parts, stating that although \"Mass Effect\" features numerous technical issues, most of the game \"is so expertly delivered that it can transcend its weaknesses.\"\n\nWriting for \"Game Informer\", Andrew Reiner said that the game's interactive storytelling encourages replay and that its detailed story \"makes the relationships feel real—you care about your crew, and you really feel like you have a voice that resonates throughout the galaxy.\" Alex Dale of \"CVG\" stated similar pros, stating that \"never before has storytelling been so competently ingrained into a videogame, and never before has a player had so much freedom to dictate the course of a linear storyline.\" Similar praise was given to the game's detailed character models, facial animations, and voice acting. Jennifer Tsao of 1UP.com felt the digital actors evoked real-life expressions, but admitted that the lip sync had some issues. Although the visuals were credited for their dramatic set pieces and evocative soundtrack, critics noted the game's inconsistent frame rate and long loading times.\n\nCameron Lewis of \"GamePro\" praised the game's story, depth, and presentation, while Paul Curthoys of \"Official Xbox Magazine\" remarked that the game \"bothers with emotions and moments that most games don't concern themselves with\", describing it as \"a great science-fiction novel in video game form.\" In contrast, \"Edge\" concluded that the space opera setting failed to provide \"the myth and exotica to adequately follow \"Star Wars\"\". The publication also criticized the cast of characters and overall tone, saying that \"Mass Effect\" \"strives so hard to be taken seriously that it winds up feeling relentlessly dour.\" Kristan Reed of Eurogamer noted the game's slow start and overwhelming setting, observing that it would confuse players before they know what the main game is about.\n\nThe combat was generally criticized for its unbalanced mechanics and poor artificial intelligence of the squad members. \"Edge\" commented that the game's role-playing elements did not blend well with its action, while IGN criticized the squad mechanics for not having enough weight, stating that the squad members \"are quite often no more useful than cannon fodder to draw the enemy away from you.\" The inventory management was also a subject of criticism, with 1UP.com describing it as painful and tedious. The galaxy exploration was favorably compared to the 1986 adventure game \"Starflight\" and the number of optional missions was highlighted positively, but the Mako sections were disparaged for their rocky planetary design and clumsy combat mechanics. The Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3 versions of the game received similar criticism to the Xbox 360 version.\n\nIn the United States, \"Mass Effect\" debuted at #6 on The NPD Group's video game sales chart for November 2007, with sales of 473,000 copies. The simExchange had previously forecast 328,000 sales for the period. By the following month, the game was absent from NPD's top 10. \"Mass Effect\" proceeded to sell over one million units worldwide within fewer than three weeks on shelves, according to Microsoft vice president Jeff Bell. Sales rose to 1.6 million copies after six weeks of availability, and VentureBeat's Dean Takahashi noted in March 2008 that the game was \"expected to cross 2 million in sales, generating an estimated $120 million\". In November 2008, the game's Xbox 360 version received a \"Gold\" certification from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, indicating lifetime sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. In April 2011, it was reported that both \"Mass Effect\" and its sequel have combined sold more than seven million units worldwide.\n\n\"Mass Effect\" received several year-end awards, including Best RPG at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards, Roleplaying Game of the Year at the 11th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, and Best RPG at the IGN Best of 2007 Awards. In addition, \"The New York Times\" selected \"Mass Effect\" as its Game of the Year. In 2008, IGN editors ranked the game number 1 on their list of Top 25 Xbox 360 games.\n\n\"Mass Effect\" has an optional subplot where the player can develop a romantic relationship with a non-player character. If the relationship becomes more intimate, a cutscene containing partial nudity and sexual activity is shown. The scene first came under scrutiny in an article by neoconservative blogger Kevin McCullough, who employed statements such as \"\"Mass Effect\" can be customized to sodomise whatever, whomever, however, the game player wishes\", and \"with its over the net capabilities virtual orgasmic rape is just the push of a button away.\" The article was criticized by the gaming community and long-time anti-obscenity campaigner Jack Thompson, who said that \"this contrived controversy is absolutely ridiculous.\" Although McCullough ultimately issued an apology, he still considered the material offensive.\n\nSimilarly, a Fox News program by Martha MacCallum discussed the sexual content of the game. MacCallum stated that the game \"leaves nothing to the imagination\" and features the ability for players to \"engage in full graphic sex.\" Self-proclaimed psychology specialist Cooper Lawrence and video game journalist Geoff Keighley were also interviewed. Lawrence described sexual content in video games as teaching their active users to consider women as objects of desire valued solely for their sexuality. She added that the game's player character is a man who decides how many women he wants to be with. Keighley focused on challenging the accuracy of her statements and asked her if she actually played the game, to which she responded \"No\". BioWare's parent company Electronic Arts requested a correction from Fox News, but they simply responded that the company had been offered a chance to appear on the channel.\n\nAfter watching someone play the game for about two-and-a-half hours, Lawrence eventually retracted her earlier statements. She added that she had been told the game was similar to pornography, and noted that she \"has seen episodes of \"Lost\" that are more sexually explicit.\" In the interim, largely as a reaction from an offended gaming community, her latest book attracted many customer reviews on Amazon which rated it one star out of five. Many of these reviews satirically noted that they had not read her book, but heard from someone else that the book was bad, and thus voted low. \"Mass Effect\" was also banned in Singapore for a short time before it was lifted with an M18 rating. Censors in the country said that a scene with an alien and human female caressing was the main reason why the game was not allowed to be sold in video game stores.\n\nSince \"Mass Effect\" was planned as the first chapter of a trilogy, development of a sequel began shortly before the game was released. The sequel, entitled \"Mass Effect 2\", was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on January 26, 2010, and for PlayStation 3 on January 18, 2011. With the import of a completed saved game of the original \"Mass Effect\", the player can impact the story of \"Mass Effect 2\" in numerous ways. The sequel was a critical success and received multiple year-end awards, including Game of the Year at the 2011 D.I.C.E. Awards and Best Game at the 2011 British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards.\n"}

It was developed and published by SNK Playmore and was released only in Japan on June 29, 2006 due to mostly negative reviews from critics. It is the first game of the series to be presented in 3D. None of the original \"Metal Slug\" team were involved with the title.\n\nThe game had no definite title when it was first unveiled in Tokyo Game Show back in 2004. In Electronic Entertainment Expo of 2005, SNK Playmore revealed the game to be called \"Metal Slug: Evolution\". However, this was later changed to just \"Metal Slug\".\n\nAlthough only the Japanese version has been released, the Japanese version contains menus that are mostly in English, as well as English voice acting. Japanese subtitles and dialogue are also available.\n\nThe game takes place in the year 2030, two years after the first Metal Slug game and before Metal Slug 2. Series antagonist General Morden becomes allies with Oguma, president of Oguma Enterprises and world leader of technology. Because this alliance could only stand to further strengthen Morden's military power, Marco Rossi, Fio Germi, Tarma Roving, and Eri Kasamoto set out to dissolve both parties. Recurring boss character Allen O'Neil also returns to oppose the player.\n\n\"Metal Slug\" maintains many features from the 2D entries; characters use an arsenal of various guns, grenades and explosives, and vehicles. The game also introduces full three-dimensional movement to the series to coincide with its 3D presentation, which uses super deformed characters.\n\nUpgrades and customization are some of the largest new features. Players can upgrade each character's combat abilities, categorized into Pellet, Power, Hit Rate, and Machine. These abilities allow characters to increase the damage, \"splash\" radius, and accuracy of their weapons and vehicle handling, respectively. Each character begins with a full proficiency in different categories. For example, Marco starts off with a full Hit Rate skill while Fio starts with a completely upgraded Pellet skill.\n\nAnother new feature is a grade system, which ranks the player according to their performance on each of the game's 12 levels. Achieving the highest rank, the S rank, allows the player to collect medals, which are used for upgrading character attributes.\n\nPlaying through the game also awards Skill Points to the player, which can be used to upgrade 4 other abilities, which affect the amount of damage a character can withstand, their ability to evade enemy attacks, and more.\n\nThe game also includes the option to customize the titular Metal Slug to their own liking, with the ability to switch out its \"core,\" treads, weapons, and armor. An in-game laboratory can be used to build custom parts for the vehicle.\n\n\"Metal Slug\" has received mixed reviews. NTSC-uk gave the game a 2 out of a possible 10, citing its poor graphics, barren environments, and overall boring gameplay. Edge scored a 5/10, saying, \"It's a glimpse of something special waiting to happen, of a no-nonsense attitude towards combat that could be developed into a series worthy of the torch that it has chosen to bear.\"\n\n"}

It may also be called a press mult box or press bridge. The sound engineer connects several microphones to allow all of them to get clean, high-quality audio.\n\nReporters use a mult box frequently at press conferences, especially when politicians give such interviews in small spaces, where not all the reporters in a press pool can access the interviewee.\n\nA whole set of etiquette and mores has developed amongst journalists governing the use of mult boxes. Because it is often difficult to get a good sound recording from a digital recorder for later broadcast or transcription for newspaper reporting, journalists have developed informal rules for their use. For example, the media should treat the sound engineer well, because while reporters can be selfish and competitive with each other, and the equipment can go wrong in many ways, the engineer allows all of them to get a good signal. It is also extremely important to show up early to press conferences; this \"early bird gets the worm\" habit allows one to test equipment, to avoid problems caused by the chaos of most press conferences, and to work cooperatively with the engineer.\n\nThe NCAA has a specific, written policy on the use of mult boxes for all NCAA championships.\n\nUnited States government agencies usually provide a mult box for media use at press conferences. However, they are not always consistent; the United States Department of Energy sometimes makes a mult box available, but then does not make a \"media avail with speakers\"; yet at other times does \"not\" allow a mult box but follows it up with a \"press availability\". Some state government agencies or courts also may provide such equipment for free to media, but charge a fee to rent it for private events held on state property.\n\nSome colleges and universities provide the use of a mult box \"gratis\" to media who need it to record large academic events such as commencement, speaker, or funeral, but charge for leasing to certain organizations. Larger houses of worship, such as a basilica or cathedral, may provide a mult box for certain religious services, but not others, depending on their policies and the nature of the mass or eucharist. Large media events, such as the Grammy Awards, Alamo Bowl, etc., often provide a mult box for media at their press conferences as a convenience.\n\nA mult box can be an extraordinarily expensive piece of audio-visual equipment to purchase, so many organizations rent them from a communications company or government agency. Larger venues may make them available to the media for free, but rent them to private parties.\n\nIn 2011, the United States Mission to the African Union donated a state of the art mult box to the cash-starved African Union in a formal ceremony, in which they also presented new interns who will be trained to use it.\n\n\n"}

Construction began in 1891, and it opened to the public on 21 October 1897 with a performance of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's \"Faust\". \n\nThe National Theatre stood as a cultural asset of the country during a time when coffee exports were a source of its success. It presents high quality performances, with artistic criteria being very high. \n\nThe building is considered the finest historic building in the capital, and it is known for its exquisite interior which includes its lavish furnishings.\n\nConstructed in the late 19th century, when San Jose's population was only around 19,000 people, the theatre presented many private performances. Its only real competition was the \"Teatro Mora\" (also called the Municipal Theatre, or \"Teatro Municipal\"), that existed for many years before the National Theatre, until it was destroyed and deemed unsafe by an earthquake. \n\nTo finance the construction of a theatre suitable for name \"National Theatre\", the President of Costa Rica, José Joaquín Rodríguez Zeledón decided to place a tax on coffee, then the principal export product. Later, one coffee planter begged the government to remove the export tax on his product and put it on rice and beans (also principal export products of the time).\n\nThere were many problems during the early period of construction. However, the construction errors were corrected by an Italian engineer who was brought in to direct the process. It took seven years to finish the theatre, and the inauguration took place on 21 October 1897.\n\nThe front of the theatre features statues of Calderón de la Barca and Ludwig van Beethoven. There are several monuments by the entry walkway including Frédéric Chopin. The inside features the mural \"Allegory of Coffee and Bananas\" by Milanese artist Aleardo Villa, which is featured on the five colón bill.\n\nAs well as having performances several times a week, the theatre is a tourist attraction. Performances by the National Symphonic Orchestra (NSO) take place as part of orchestra's regular season, and include both Costa Rican and foreign composers.\n"}

{"id": "44472410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44472410", "title": "No Lifeguard on Duty", "text": "No Lifeguard on Duty\n\nNo Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel is an autobiography by fashion model, photographer, author and talent agent Janice Dickinson. It was published in hardcover format in 2002 by ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins. The author's friend make-up artist Way Bandy advised her to begin putting her past experiences down on paper as a form of therapy from prior trauma in her life. After gaining sobriety, she started compiling her notes into book format. She contacted book publisher Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish her book after hearing her tale on the phone, without first seeing a writing sample. In November 2014, Dickinson asserted in an interview with \"Entertainment Tonight\" that pressure from Bill Cosby and his lawyers resulted in the removal of an account of sexual assault and rape by Cosby when she visited him at a hotel in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982. After Cosby's attorney disputed this account, she reappeared on the program to proclaim she was telling the truth and explained she was speaking out publicly because of a need to be heard and to represent other women who stated they experienced a similar trauma.\n\nThe book recounts Dickinson's early life where she states she experienced child abuse from her father, and moves forward describing her experiences throughout her career as a model. Dickinson explains her struggle with substance dependence upon drugs and alcohol during her career. The author discusses her time as a representative for companies including Virginia Slims, Max Factor, and Hush Puppies; and her success appearing on the covers of magazines including: \"Vogue\", \"Elle\", \"Harper's Bazaar\", and \"Cosmo\". While performing work as a model she takes the time to gain knowledge about the craft of photography and fashion. Dickinson describes how she originated the term \"supermodel\". \"No Lifeguard on Duty\" cautions about the tendency towards insecurity in celebrity culture.\n\n\"No Lifeguard on Duty\" received a favorable reception from multiple publications. Film rights to the book were purchased by Warner Bros. in 2004. \"Women's Wear Daily\" praised the author's comedic style in the work. Knight Ridder Newspapers wrote positively of the author's courage at describing difficult experiences from her past. \"The New York Observer\" found the writing style of the book to have a good flow throughout. \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote: \"Dickinson comes across as a triumphant survivor.\"\n\nDickinson's book had a positive impact on her career. Because of reading the book, Tyra Banks decided to bring Dickinson on board as a judge on her new program \"America's Next Top Model\" in 2003. Dickinson served as a judge on the program for a total of four seasons before being replaced by Twiggy Lawson. Oxygen Network subsequently hired her for its new program centered on the author's efforts to start her own company; the program launched in 2006 titled: \"The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency\".\n\nJanice Dickinson's friend make-up artist Way Bandy recommended she use the writing process to help heal from her past experiences. She began to do so as part of her addiction recovery during a twelve-step program. She put her notes down on legal pads and they became numerous over time. By the time Dickinson began to compile her writing into book format she had become established in her career and resided in Los Angeles, California with her two children. She started formally putting her notes together into a book after successfully gaining sobriety.\n\nShe got in touch with book publisher Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish the book after a brief phone call, without first receiving a draft of the work. In an interview with \"Los Angeles Magazine\", Dickinson recalled the process of pitching her book to Regan: \"I got a book deal without even turning in one shred of a writing sample. I was having an invincible moment. I told her how difficult it was for me growing up with an abusive father, how when I went to New York to become a model I was rejected for a year for being 'too ethnic.' Judith said, 'Okay, I'm in.'\"\nThe author explained to \"Los Angeles Magazine\" her reasoning for including in the book a graphic phrase used by Jack Nicholson after his lovemaking session with her: \"The reason that line made the book is because he told me not to say anything. And I will never, ever respond to anybody—man, woman, vegetable, or mineral—who tells me to keep my mouth shut. Alter what I've been through, I don't think so, pal.\"\n\nDickinson explained in an interview that she authored the work to communicate to others to publicly reveal their past negative experiences as a way to heal from trauma. She stated: \"I wrote this book to urge people not to keep secrets. I still suffer. The memories are still vivid. I made a lot of mistakes. I was shaped by my mistakes. But the past is done. The future's up to me.\"\n\nJanice Dickinson describes her early life where she suffered child abuse and physical abuse at the hands of her father. She writes that her three sisters and mother also experienced abuse from her father. She recounts her ups and downs during her career while finding success in the fashion industry. She emphasizes how bravery is important to success, and explains how she remained firm on her request for US$20,000 for a modeling position when the market figure at the time was only $5,000. Throughout the process she experiences emotional pain from relationships that lack depth, and learns for herself about the harms of substance dependence. Incidents related to her drug addiction problems include ingesting heroin from Gia Carangi prior to a photography session in Italy, and an experience in a state of alcohol intoxication falling off a fashion runway for Valentino Garavani and landing upon Sophia Loren.\n\nThe author discusses her time as a representative for companies including Virginia Slims, Max Factor, and Hush Puppies. She writes of her success appearing on the covers of magazines including: \"Vogue\", \"Elle\", \"Harper's Bazaar\", and \"Cosmo\". Professional photographers including Francesco Scavullo, Norman Parkinson, Irving Penn, Richard Avedon, Peter Beard, and Michael Reinhardt work with her in photoshoots. While performing work as a model she takes the time to gain knowledge about the craft of photography and fashion.\n\nIn the book she asserts that her experiences helped influence models who came after her including Cindy Crawford and Christy Turlington. She writes that she was the first to use the term \"supermodel\" and refers to herself as such. She recounts a particular exchange with her agent Monique Pillard who asked her: \"Janice, you are working night and day. Who do you think you are, superman?\" Dickinson responded: \"No, honey. I'm supermodel.\"\n\nDickinson remembers relationships with fellow celebrities including Sylvester Stallone, Liam Neeson, Warren Beatty, Mick Jagger, and Jack Nicholson. She enjoys her celebrity status and her time with friends John Belushi, Truman Capote, and Andy Warhol. Belushi and Dickinson enable each other's predilections for abusing drugs. She regularly spends time at Studio 54 during this period. Dickinson recounts a darker side of celebrity, and writes that she trusted in Bill Cosby when he informed her he could help her career in show business, only to experience verbal anger from him when she said she was too tired to engage in sexual activity with him.\n\nShe was supported during her career by her friendship with actor Bruce Willis and her positive connections with her sisters. She reflects on the nature of her marriages and looks back on her prior self-indulgent lifestyle. She explains to the reader how personal achievement may result from the allure of success, and simultaneously cautions against harmful byproducts of behavioral insecurity inherent in the mystique of celebrity.\n\nThe book was published in hardcover format by HarperCollins in 2002 under its imprint ReganBooks in the United States. Another edition was released the same year in the United Kingdom. The book was re-published in both formats in 2003, with a new cover. ReganBooks released a subsequent edition in 2004 with a third cover re-design. HarperCollins published eBook formats of the work in 2007 and 2008. Three editions of the book were published under its third cover design in 2009.\n\nWarner Bros. purchased the film rights to the book in 2004. Dickinson subsequently turned her works into a trilogy of three books. She followed up on \"No Lifeguard on Duty\" with \"Everything About Me Is FakeAnd I'm Perfect\" in 2004, and \"Check, Please!Dating, Mating, and Extricating\" in 2006.\n\n\"No Lifeguard on Duty\" received a favorable review from \"Publishers Weekly\". The review concluded: \"The book is sometimes predictable and psychologically simplistic, but Dickinson comes across as a triumphant survivor. Her willingness to recognize her own flaws makes it easy to relate to her positive message and should inspire readers searching for solutions to career and personal conflicts.\" The review praised the author's ability at being: \"honest enough to acknowledge the stimulating aspects of success and glamour, explaining why they lure insecure personalities and imprison them past the point of no return.\" \"Women's Wear Daily\" reviewed the book and wrote: \"What keeps the book from becoming too tawdry is Dickinson's sense of humor. She applies a healthy dose to both her conquests and disaster's alike.\"\n\nIn a 2002 article, Knight Ridder Newspapers characterized the book as: \"a brave, profane memoir of her escape from childhood abuse into the even more risky whirl of bright lights, big cities and spiraling self-destruction.\" A subsequent article in 2003 by Knight Ridder Newspapers wrote: \"what makes Dickinson's tome stand out from all the other Hollywood memoirs is that she has a cheeky sense of humor about her self-absorption.\" Philip Weiss of \"The New York Observer\" wrote: \"I read \"No Lifeguard on Duty\" at once and wasn't disappointed. Janice Dickinson is a funny and fluid narrator.\" Of the author's path to success recounted in the book, the \"International Herald Tribune\" wrote: \"Janice Dickinson had a cometlike trajectory as an early supermodel in the 1980s, which she has recounted in her raunchy life story\".\n\nWhile reading Dickinson's book, English novelist Jackie Collins ran into the author at a bookstore and asked the fellow author to lunch to discuss their mutual experiences. Janice Dickinson landed a television role as a judge on the program \"America's Next Top Model\" due to \"No Lifeguard on Duty\". Show creator Tyra Banks explained to \"The Boston Herald\" her decision process: \"The reason why I hired Janice Dickinson is because I read her book (\"No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel\"), and that book represented every single thing that I have never done. Every single thing that I have never experienced.\"\n\nBanks elaborated that she wanted a judge on the program that had gone through issues in her modeling career that she herself had not: \"I sit all the time and talk to girls and say, 'Don't drink. Don't smoke. Don't go out. Don't do this. I never did it.' But there's only so much you can preach to someone if you've never done it. I thought I could have someone like Janice because she's so outrageous.\" Banks stated that she thought Dickinson provided a warning to models not to follow the path she had taken because it had proved dangerous:\" When she's telling a girl, 'Don't do this,' she's saying, 'Don't do this because it didn't work for me.' I thought it was a good balance.\"\n\nAfter serving as a judge on the program for four seasons, Dickinson's spot was filled with Twiggy Lawson in 2005 for the show's fifth season. In December of the same year, Oxygen Network hired Dickinson for its new reality modeling television program which at the time was initially titled \"The Janice Dickinson Project\". It centered on her efforts to launch her own business with a modeling agency. Her television show launched in 2006, titled: \"The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency\".\n\nIn a November 18, 2014 interview with Dickinson on \"Entertainment Tonight\", she stated the initial version of \"No Lifeguard on Duty\" was different from what became the final published product. Dickinson said she wrote about a traumatic experience where she said Bill Cosby sexually assaulted her in 1982 at a hotel in Lake Tahoe, California. She stated that Cosby supplied her with red wine and then medicated her with drugs and subsequently raped her at the hotel. According to Dickinson, both Cosby himself and his attorneys persuaded the author and her publisher HarperCollins to delete mention of the incident from her book prior to publication. A few hours after the interview was publicized on \"Entertainment Tonight\", Netflix made the decision to postpone its Cosby comedy film special \"Bill Cosby 77\" from its lineup.\n\nMartin Singer, an attorney representing Cosby, made a statement in which he asserted Dickinson was not being truthful in her account. After Singer's statement, Dickinson reappeared on a subsequent broadcast of \"Entertainment Tonight\" to reassert her account from her prior interview on the program. In addition, she publicized photographs she took with a Polaroid camera of Cosby wearing a checkered bathrobe in order to support her assertions. In the interview with Kevin Frazier she stated her account was the truth: \"It is not a lie. It is my right as a woman. I have to speak up and you have to be able to go in and just be brave and do it for all the women that can't come forward.\" She explained her motivation for going public and her desire for her voice to be heard: \"The loss of innocence that I suffered and that these women suffered is why I'm sitting here today. And I don't care about what Cosby or networks or anybody says, you will hear me.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The festival had a \"Round Scene with a Corner\". The festival bears the name of the famous Serbian comedy playwright, Branislav Nušić, who used the sentence \"You’re bound for Ivanjica!\" as a punchline in his comedies, indicating the 19th century threat of exile to this town. Later it became the festival’s slogan and the invitation to Ivanjica. In 1972, the festival ended.\n\n\nIn 2008, a citizen petition for reviving the festival was signed by over 10% of the population. A citizen organisation named KudeS (Cultural Decentralization of Serbia) was formed and led the process of organizing the new festival. After the local Assembly adopted the proposal, the Municipality of Ivanjica, Ivanjica Culture Centre and Ivanjica Tourism Organisation joined the partnership, and these four organizations organised Nušićijada beginning in 2010.\n\nAccording to the organizers, the 2015 Nušićijada attracted attention of more than 55,000 visitors, the most since founding.

The concept was also important in Medieval and Renaissance music theory.\n\nGreek theorists used two terms interchangeably to describe what we call species: \"eidos\" (εἶδος) and \"skhēma\" (σχῆμα), defined as \"a change in the arrangement of incomposite [intervals] making up a compound magnitude while the number and size of the intervals remains the same\" ( (da Rios), translated in ). Cleonides (the Aristoxenian tradition) described (in the diatonic genus) three species of diatessaron, four of diapente and seven of diapason. Ptolemy in his \"Harmonics\" called them all generally \"species of primary consonances\" (εἴδη τῶν πρώτων συμφωνιῶν). Boethius, who inherited Ptolemy's generalization under the term \"species primarum consonantiarum\" (Inst. mus. IV,14), expanded species theory of Greeks; along with the traditional orderings of three primary species he introduced three further their orderings . For epistemology of the Antiquity music theory, the most important of all was the octave species, because \"from the species of the consonance of the diapason arise what are called \"modes\"\" .\n\nThe basis of octave species was the smaller category of species of the perfect fourth, or \"diatessaron\"; when filled in with two intermediary notes, the resulting four notes and three consecutive intervals constitute a \"tetrachord\" . The species defined by the different positioning of the intervals within the tetrachord in turn depend upon genus first being established . Incomposite in this context refers to intervals not composed of smaller intervals.\nMost Greek theorists distinguish three genera of the tetrachord: enharmonic, chromatic, and diatonic. The enharmonic and chromatic genera are defined by the size of their largest incomposite interval (major third and minor third, respectively), which leaves a composite interval of two smaller parts, together referred to as a \"pyknon\"; in the diatonic genus, no single interval is larger than the other two combined . The earliest theorists to attempt a systematic treatment of octave species, the harmonicists (or school of Eratocles) of the late fifth century BC, confined their attention to the enharmonic genus, with the intervals in the resulting seven octave species being :\n\nSpecies of the perfect fifth (\"diapente\") are then created by the addition of a whole tone to the intervals of the tetrachord. The first, or original species in both cases has the \"pyknon\" or, in the diatonic genus, the semitone, at the bottom and, similarly, the lower interval of the \"pyknon\" must be smaller or equal to the higher one . The whole tone added to create the species of fifth (the \"tone of disjunction\") is at the top in the first species; the remaining two species of fourth and three species of fifth are regular rotations of the constituent intervals, in which the lowest interval of each species becomes the highest of the next (; ). Because of these constraints, tetrachords containing three different incomposite intervals (compared with those in which two of the intervals are of the same size, such as two whole tones) still have only three species, rather than the six possible permutations of the three elements . Similar considerations apply to the species of fifth.\n\nThe species of fourth and fifth are then combined into larger constructions called \"systems\". The older, central \"characteristic octave\", is made up of two first-species tetrachords separated by a tone of disjunction, and is called the Lesser Perfect System . It therefore includes a lower, first-species fifth and an upper, fourth-species fifth. To this central octave are added two flanking conjuct tetrachords (that is, they share the lower and upper tones of the central octave). This constitutes the Greater Perfect System, with six fixed bounding tones of the four tetrachords, within each of which are two movable pitches. labels the resulting fourteen pitches with the (Greek) letters from Α (Alpha α) to Ο (Omega Ω). (A diagram is available at systema ametabolon)\n\nThe Lesser and Greater Perfect Systems exercise constraints on the possible octave species. Some early theorists, such as Gaudentius in his \"Harmonic Introduction\", recognized that, if the various available intervals could be combined in any order, even restricting species to just the diatonic genus would result in twelve ways of dividing the octave (and his 17th-century editor, Marcus Meibom, pointed out that the actual number is 21), but \"only seven species or forms are melodic and symphonic\" . Those octave species that cannot be mapped onto the system are therefore rejected .\n\nIn chant theory beginning in the 9th century, the \"New Exposition\" of the composite treatise called \"Alia musica\" developed an eightfold modal system from the seven diatonic octave species of ancient Greek theory, transmitted to the West through the Latin writings of Martianus Capella, Cassiodorus, Isidore of Seville, and, most importantly, Boethius. Together with the species of fourth and fifth, the octave species remained in use as a basis of the theory of modes, in combination with other elements, particularly the system of octoechos borrowed from the Eastern Orthodox Church .\n\nSpecies theory in general (not just the \"octave\" species) remained an important theoretical concept throughout Middle Ages. The following appreciation of species as a structural basis of a mode, found in the \"Lucidarium\" (XI, 3) of Marchetto (ca. 1317), can be seen as typical:\n\nWe declare that those who judge the mode of a melody exclusively with regard to ascent and descent cannot be called musicians, but rather blind men, singers of mistake... for, as Bernard said, \"species are dishes at a musical banquet; they create modes\" .\n\n\n"}

Plate spinning relies on the gyroscopic effect, in the same way a top stays upright while spinning. Spinning plates are sometimes gimmicked, to help keep the plates on the poles. \n\nMany Chinese acrobatics troupes feature plate spinning, usually in combination with contortion or acrobatic skills. These usually feature performers holding several plates in each hand spinning on sticks. \n\nWestern plate spinning performers usually present comedy acts and typically feature one performer with an assistant, spinning multiple plates on sticks held vertically in stands.\n\nOther forms of plate manipulation include plate waltzing, where plates are spun on their edges on a table top, and plate juggling, where plates are manipulated and thrown by the performers. Some performers have combined several of these elements into restaurant or kitchen-themed acts.\nThe Guinness World Record for spinning multiple plates is held by David Spathaky, assisted by Debbie Woolley, who spun 108 plates simultaneously in Bangkok, Thailand, on television in 1996. He had previously held and broken his own record four times since 1986.\n\nThe tune \"Sabre Dance\" is often played in the background. This was a popular act on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" (by Erich Brenn) and other American variety and talent shows during the early years of American television. Tom Griswold, co-host of \"The Bob & Tom Show\", a syndicated American comedy radio program, occasionally says he wishes he could see a plate spinner on TV again and wants to book one for his staff's annual Christmas party, which Chick McGee cites as further evidence that Griswold is out of touch with contemporary entertainment. In an episode of the \"Simpsons\", at the Springfield Retirement Castle talent show, one participant does a similar act, but uses the dentures of several of the residents. Plate spinning was often seen in HBO's prison drama \"Oz\", where an unnamed prisoner would often be seen spinning a book on the tip of a pen.\n\nOn British television, the popular game show \"The Generation Game\" would regularly feature a plate spinner demonstrating his skills, then inviting the contestants to have a go - with smashing results. During the 1960s & 1970s Wolfgang Bartchelli popularised plate spinning in Europe and regularly appeared on television. From the 1980s onward, plate spinner Andrew Van Buren regularly appeared and still can be seen presenting this format on game shows, on television and performing around the world.\n\n"}

Besides Bjelogrlić, screenplay was also done by Danica Pajović, Dejan Stojiljković and Vladimir Kecmanović, based on a story written by Stevan Koprivica. The series was done in co-production with Cobra Film, Radio Television of Serbia, Skopje Film Studio, Iskra, RTRS, Macedonian Radio Television and The Film Agency of the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nThe series is set in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes during the Interwar period and follows the story of two Belgrade police department inspectors. The first season is set during the period just before the 6 January Dictatorship and follows the attempts of the two inspectors to solve the cases of sacrificial murders which were shaking the Belgrade public.\n\nDragan Bjelogrlić, Andrija Kuzmanović, Marija Bergam, Aleksandr Galibin, Nenad Jezdić, Gordan Kičić, Nebojša Dugalić, Sebastian Cavazza and Toni Mihajlovski are in the lead roles. The first season ran from 22. October 2017 to 24. December 2017 on the RTS1 channel, as well as on many other television channels from former Yugoslavia. The filming of the first season took place between October 2016 and June 2017, while the second season will be filmed during 2018 and will be airing in 2019. The first season was received very well by both the audience and critics, although it caused some controversy. Production, acting, editing and costume design have all been praised, as well as the themes the series deals with.\n\nThe series is divided in three seasons and encompasses the period between 1928 and 1940.\n\nThe first season covers the period just before the assassination of the Croatian Member of National Assembly Stjepan Radić at the National Assembly of the Serbs, Croatians and Slovenians and the subsequent establishment of the dictatorship.\n\nBelgrade in between two World Wars was chosen as the main setting for the series. At the center of events we find the main characters – fifty year old criminal police inspector Andra Tanasijević Tane and his new associate, a young forensic by the name of Stanko Pletikosić. Belgrade is portrayed as a place where crime consists of classic robberies and murders, but whose biggest problems are wars between opium cartels, which use the city as just another route for smuggling the expensive and precious drug further into Europe and United States.\n\nThe plot of the first season starts with a very peculiar and brutal murder which occurs at a costume ball where most of the Belgrade's social elite is gathered. Inspector Tanasijević soon realizes that the cause of the frequent eerie events, which are beginning to grow in number by the day, is an ancient relic – Holy Lance (with which Jesus was pierced through on the cross) – to which mystical powers are ascribed. He realizes that there are people who are ready to do anything to have it in their possession and is sucked into the entangled web of crime of which all the obscure interest groups from the Balkans from that time are part of the Russian White army of general Vrangel, the secret police of the Soviet Union (OGPU and NKVD), Black Hand, IMRO, Yugoslav communists, the underbelly of Belgrade and secret society called Thule. Following the traces of the committed crimes, the inspector starts looking for relic with one goal in mind – to remove it from Belgrade and prevent more innocent deaths.\n\nDragan Bjelogrlić played the main role of inspector Tane, and he was also the producer and director.\n\nGordan Kičić played the role of Alimpije Mirić, one of the main antagonists. He said that he saw the screenplay as far back as 2014. He filmed his scenes in the first season from October 2016 to May 2017. He didn’t film his scenes in continuity but in parts which lasted a couple of days.\n\nNenad Jezdić, who plays the antagonist by the name of Krojač (Tailor), at first wished to play the role of inspector Tane. The role of Krojač was his last available choice. Slovenian actor Sebastian Cavazza got the role of Gabriel Maht. \n\nThe role of general Vrangel went to the Russian actor Aleksandr Galibin, who remarked that he was delighted to play such an important historical figure: \"It is such a precious thing to me to be playing such an important historical figure as general Vrangel was. I am particularly glad that we are filming in this church, where his body rests. That is especially touching.\"\n\nIn the second season, the Slovenian actor Jernej Šugman, who passed away in December 2017, was supposed to play the role of Anton Korošec minister of internal affairs of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe role of Stanko Pletikosić was supposed to be played by Miloš Biković, with whom Bjelogrlić already collaborated on \"Montevideo, God Bless You!\", but Biković gave up because of the obligations he had in Russia. Andrija Kuzmanović got the role in the end who also acted in \"Montevideo\".\n\nBrankica Sebastijanović and Marija Bergam were two main contenders for the role of Maja Davidović, with Bergam getting the role.\n\nMacedonian actor Toni Mihajlovski plays the role of Damjan Hadži Arsov, a fictitious member of Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization. Dejan Stojiljković, who is one of the screenwriters, said that his character is not based on Vanča Mihailov, but \"has more similarities with Bulgarian revolutionary Dame Gruev\". Macedonian actress Jana Stojanovska plays the role of Macedonian revolutionary Jovana, who is the sister of Damjan Hadži Arsov. Her character was based on Mara Buneva, also the member of Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization.\n\nThe role of the owner of the tavern \"Savsko bure\", who deserted the Austro-Hungarian army by managing to get across Sava river in a barrel is played by Aleksandar Stojković Piksi. Vladimir Vuletić, the vice president of FK Partizan, had a cameo role as one of the Thule henchman.\n\nSeries is planned to have three seasons.\n\nFirst season had ten episodes and dealt with the time period just before the 6. January dictatorship. Second season is planned to deal with the time period before the Marseilles assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, while the third season will be set just before start of World War Two in Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n\nPre-premiere in Serbia was on 17 October 2017 at Yugoslav Film Archive. The series had a premiere in Serbia on RTS on 12 October 2017 and had a time slot at 8 pm, which has long been the default time slot for all Serbian and Yugoslav TV series. The first episode in Serbia was watched by more than 2.123.000 viewers and was the most watched media on that channel.\n\nThe premiere in Bosnia and Herzegovina was at the 23th Sarajevo Film Festival, where two episodes which received ovations were shown. The first season was airing on RTRS.\n\nIn Montenegro the series is aired on RTCG 1, and in Macedonia on MRT 1. The series debuted in Macedonia at the 38. Manaki Brothers Film Festival in Bitola on 25 September 2017, and Dragan Bjelogrlić, Tomi Salkovski (co-producer), Igor Ivanov Izi (director on one of the episodes) as well as the actors Marija Bergam, Jana Stojanovska, Pero Arsovski and Petar Atanovski addressed the audience. \n\nThere was a great controversy in Croatian media for not airing the first season, and the reasons cited were that it was due to the character of Ante Pavelić and also that Dragan Bjelogrlić himself forbade it. Bjelogrlić dismissed these claims and said that the main reason for the series not airing in Croatia was because no channel acquired the rights to air.\n\nThe series was to start airing in Russia in December 2017. In Slovenia it’s been airing since 7 January 2018. on Planet TV.\n\nThe managing director of RTS Dragan Bujošević confirmed in an interview for Večernje Novosti on 14 January 2018 that RTS won’t be airing the second season because of the high price Cobra Film asked for. In an interview for N1 TV on 3 January 2018. Dragan Bjelogrlić named HBO and Top TV which is owned by SBB as the highest bidders for the new season, while RTS gave the lowest bid.\n\nBjelogrlić gave 2019 as the year in which the second season will be airing. The name of the series was translated into English as \"Black Sun\" which refers to the symbol that can be frequently in the series and also \"Shadows over Balkan\".\n\nDragan Bjelogrlić first got interested in the time period in which the series is set while filming the TV series as well as the movie version of Montevideo, God Bless You! He got interested in this period because he knew very little of it and he also thought that the Serbian public in general isn’t well informed about it: \"Our destiny was such that we never learned much about that time period, it was almost never talked about. And those were important and in a way intense times, especially in Yugoslavia.\" The fact that Yugoslavia was called \"Colombia of Europe\" between the two Wars also served as an inspiration to him.\n\nIn his article for Blic he wrote that he didn’t want to compromise on any part of the show’s creation: \"Shadows over Balkan is a piece for which I tried to make no compromises. There were no compromises on any level and in any phase of the show’s production. From the screenplay, story, themes, national divisions, aesthetics, direction to the budget and cost. I didn’t want to concern myself with the acquired taste of the RTS audience, ratings, political correctness, puritan moral principles, conservative historians, first and second Serbia, and the like…\" He seriously doubted in the success of the show, because \"in aesthetic, dramaturgic and narrative aspects it was different than everything else he worked on in the past.\" He was inspired by a number of American, German, Italian, Scandinavian and Eastern European TV series, and as the main source of inspiration he cited Boardwalk Empire. He was also inspired by the connection between crime and corruption saying how \"when he put some things in order, he came to the conclusion that there exists a historic constant which affects this region, because it is of utmost importance that when you are working on a piece of art which deals with the past, it is important to focus on the moment from which you are doing it.\"\n\nThe filming of the first season took place between 1 October 2016 and end of July 2017. The series was shot on many different locations in Belgrade, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a new film studio was also built in Baranda. Poor part of Belgrade from that period was constructed here -Jatagan Mala with fictive kafanas named \"Kod Nišliju\" (\"At Niški's\") and \"Savsko bure\" (\"Sava barrel\"), Pištoljmala and Savamala), as well as the richer part with a marketplace, a candy shop and a quilt shop, as well as a barber shop. According to Bjelogrlić, 30% of the filming took place in Baranda. Some particular scenes were shot on Zrenjanin streets as well as in its City Hall. Some scenes were supposed to be filmed in Slovenia as well, RTV Slovenija was in support of this, but it was later abandoned due to financial reasons.\n\nTogether with Bjelogrlić, the screenplay was worked on by screenwriters Danica Pajović, Dejan Stojiljković and Vladimir Kecmanović adapted to a film story by Stevan Koprivica. Koprivica worked on some of the early episodes, and according to Danica Pajović, \"the story was a Conan-Doyle type mystic drama about two inspectors who are working on resolving a series of sacrificial murders in Belgrade set between the two Wars. Bjelogrlić then expanded the theme to the Belgrade underbelly and opium trade in Yugoslavia and convoluted the story to such an extent that Dejan Stojiljković and I had to join the screenwriters team, with Vladimir Kecmanović also joining us later.\" According to his own words, this was the first time Dejan Stojiljković wrote a screenplay for a movie or a TV series.\n\nRobert Pešut Magnifico, with whom Bjelogrlić already collaborated on \"Montevideo \", worked on the soundtrack for the series. Ognjen Radivojević sang the song in the title sequence, and he was chosen by Magnifico and Bjelogrlić \"because of his specific tone of voice and emotions which emerge from his vocal range.\"\n\n"}

The Spuds MacKenzie mascot and campaign were created by a 23-year-old art director, Jon Moore. At the time he was working at Needham, Harper & Steers, a Chicago, Illinois, advertising agency. The dog first showed up in a Bud Light Super Bowl XXI ad in 1987. During the height of his popularity, large amounts of Spuds merchandise was available, such as plush toys and t-shirts where the dog was seen surfing a wave or \"Hanging Twenty\".\n\nThe dog, a Bull Terrier, was not without its share of controversy. Shortly after Spuds' rise to fame it was learned that the dog, who was portrayed as male in the commercials, was actually female. The ads were also the subject of attacks and calls for censorship by temperance-oriented groups. Soon after the ads were first aired in 1987, Senator Strom Thurmond began his own media campaign, claiming that the beer maker was using Spuds to appeal to children for the purpose of getting them interested in their product at an early age. By Christmas 1987, more legal action resulted from Budweiser's use of ads featuring Spuds dressed as Santa, which is illegal in states such as Ohio.\n\nIn 1989, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, along with Mothers Against Drunk Driving, alleged that Anheuser-Busch was pitching the dog to children. Although the Federal Trade Commission found no evidence to support that allegation, Anheuser-Busch decided to retire Spuds in 1989, claiming that the character's image had started to overshadow the product.\n\nThe character appeared in Bud Light's advertisement in Super Bowl LI as a ghost helping a man named Brian reunite with his friends in an homage to Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\". The house number in this advertisement's last segment is 1989, paying homage to the year Spuds was retired.\n\nThe dog's real name was Honey Tree Evil Eye or \"Evie\" for short (October 7, 1983 – May 31, 1993). She was from Malvern, Pennsylvania, but moved to Warsaw, Indiana at a very young age. She died of renal failure in North Riverside, Illinois.\n\nFinally, in 1985 Evie also became the mascot for a surfing brand based in Florida called \"Salty Dog\", which held an annual \"Hang Twenty Surf\" Contest.

{"id": "1746511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1746511", "title": "Suicide (game)", "text": "Suicide (game)\n\nSuicide (sometimes abbreviated to \"suey\"), or otherwise referred to as \"elimination\", is a game typically played by children and teenagers. The rules vary widely from place to place; those given below are not necessarily a \"standard\" form of the rules.\n\nSuicide requires at least two players, and can have as many as can be accommodated by the playing area. The playing area comprises a hard surface, such as concrete, and a large, flat wall, and is usually outdoors. The game also requires a rubber ball or a tennis ball.\n\nSuicide may be played in teams, but is most commonly played individually.\n\nThe object of the game is to be the last remaining player. In order to stay in the game, players have to avoid being \"pegged\" out.\n\nWhen the game begins, a player throws the ball against the wall. If the ball bounces off the wall and then hits the ground, other players are free to grab the ball and re-throw it. If the ball is caught by another player before it hits the ground, the player who threw the ball must run and touch the wall. Until the player touches the wall, they are \"open\" to be \"pegged\" (i.e., struck hard with a thrown ball) by the player who caught it. If a player comes into contact with the ball but fails to catch it, they are also \"open\" to be \"pegged\".\n\nNote: for games featuring more sensitive players, it may be acceptable, instead of pegging a player who is open to get them out, to throw the ball at the wall before the player \"tags up\" (touches the wall). The no-pegging rule must be stated before the game begins. If someone is pegged with the ball when the no-pegging rule is in effect, then it would be the same as if the player had simply missed the wall on the return.\n\nThere is no object—continuous play.\n\nWhen the game begins, a player throws the ball against the wall. The ball is \"in-play\". If the ball bounces off the wall and then hits the ground, other players are free to grab the ball and re-throw. Players must throw any \"in-play\" ball from where it was caught.\n\nA player throwing the ball after the catch of an \"in-play\" ball will be \"open\" when:\n\nA ball that simultaneously hits the wall and the ground at the same time (also sometimes called a \"chink\") is legal, and the throwing player is not open.\n\nA player who did not throw the ball is \"open\" when they touch the ball, but do not catch it for any reason. While a player is \"open\" they may be \"pegged\" (i.e. struck hard with a thrown ball) until they touch the wall. An \"open\" player may be \"pegged\" any number of times until they touch the wall. A player throwing a \"pegging\" ball that misses all \"open\" players becomes \"open\" themselves and must touch the wall.\n\nRoughhousing is acceptable in most games, including setting picks and tripping up players attempting to go for the ball or go for the wall. It is not permissible, however, to physically interfere with a player who is throwing the ball, nor is it permissible to stand against the wall and prevent other players from touching it when they need to. Doing either of those constitutes a penalty. Fighting and overly rough play may also draw a penalty.\n\nThe \"no-pegging\" rule may be waived for penalties, but if it is not, then a player who receives a penalty gets an automatic out.\n\nAnother penalty is enforced for the practice known as \"wall-hugging.\" Wall-hugging, in its purest form, occurs when a player positions themselves so that they are in constant contact with the wall. Therefore, in theory, if the ball hits them, they automatically become \"safe\", since they are already in contact with the wall. This is considered unfair and is dealt with accordingly.\n\nA player who wall-hugs, which is officially called when a player stands against the wall at the moment the ball contacts it (unless they are touching the wall to save themselves), is considered open. In order to be safe, the offending player is required to run to the other side of the court (either an opposite wall or an arbitrary marker set up beforehand) and then run back and touch the wall.\n\nWall-hugging can be modified to some arbitrary point before the wall (usually several steps away). In this case, even without touching the wall, players can be penalized as if they were wall-hugging.\n\nAn \"out\" based system is applied in many games, where three outs causes a player to leave the game and, in some cases, endure a \"punishment\" as described below. Another commonly used substitute for \"outs\" is the usage of a predetermined number of \"lives\", which can be lost the same way as in the \"outs\" system, or in some variants even be gained.\n\nIn some games that allow pegging, a player who is pegged for three outs (or loses all \"lives\") is forced to stand facing the wall with their hands on the wall, in a position similar to a police 'pat-down' stance (often referred to as \"Bottoms Up\"). The player who pegged them last is then allowed to peg them from any distance as hard as possible either one or three times depending on the severity of the rules. Variations of this rule are that three players are mutually selected to peg the victim once each, that the punishing player can choose to \"give\" one or more of their three pegs to other players, or that all players are allowed one peg each at the victim, which can include 10 or more players in a larger game. The punishing players often aim for the head or buttocks of the victim. Headhunting may be allowed in this punishment ritual even when it is not allowed in normal play.\n\nSuicide games are usually won by those who have expert dexterity and the ability to run and throw the ball fast. There are a number of offensive and defensive strategies that players can employ.\n\n\nIn general, players should avoid throwing the ball so that it comes off the wall either as a roller or a line drive. The harder the ball is to catch, the better the throw. Balls that fly high in the air are dangerous for they may be caught on the fly.\n\nThere are various elaborations on the base game concept which involve the use of \"calling out\" phrases in specific situations to enact special rules.\n\nIf the game is played with a fence behind the court used and a \"lives\" system is being utilized, \"watermelon\" rules may be applied. If the ball seems as if it is about to go over the fence, any player can call out \"watermelon\". If the ball goes over the fence, those players gain a \"life\". If it doesn't, they lose one. \"Watermelon\" must be called out before the ball is within a short distance of the fence.\n\nThere is also a \"freeze\" rule used in some occasions (in some places it's renamed \"challenge\", or \"reach\"), wherein whenever a player catches the ball from a long distance away from the wall, any other player may call out \"freeze\", meaning the person who has caught the ball must stop where they stand and throw the ball. When reaching the wall is impossible for the player, some games allow for the player to call \"relay\" and pass the ball to a player within reach of the wall.

They are known for their Internet series Honest Government Ads and Juice Rap News.\n\nTJM has been at the centre of a number of political controversies including the use of the \"Australien\" logo that is at the heart of a Bill to change the Australian Criminal Code Act as well as the divisive Australia Day piracy video.\n\nTJM was founded by Giordano Nanni, an Australian historian, author, satirist and video producer. TJM started publishing on YouTube in May 2008 with the first episode of Juice Rap News premiering on 4 October 2009. On 28 May 2016 Juice Media launched the Honest Government ad series with Visit Australia.\n\nOn 24 January 2017 TJM released the controversial \"Australia Day\" (Piracy parody).\n\nThe Australien Coat of Harms was created as the backdrop to the fictitious Department of Genuine Satire for the Honest Government Adverts. There are a number of notable differences between the fictitious Coat of Harms and the Commonwealth Coat of Arms that it lampoons including:\n\n\nIn September 2017 TJM received an e-mail from the Australian National Symbols Officer requesting that the use of the satirical logo no longer be used as they had received complaints from the members of the public about the logo. Coincidentally 5 days later a Bill was proposed to Australian parliament to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995.\n\nThe summary for the Bill was stated as:Amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to: introduce new offences for a person recklessly or intentionally representing themselves to be, or to be acting on behalf of, or with the authority of, a Commonwealth entity or service; and introduce a new injunction power to allow authorised persons to seek injunctive relief to prevent a person from engaging in conduct in contravention of the new offences.The case for the amendments to the Bill were presented in the Senate by the Attorney-General Hon. George Brandis QC\n\nThere were a number of public submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee overseeing the proposed amendments. Among the submissions were pieces from Australian Lawyers for Human Rights and Electronic Frontiers Australia both of which expressed concerns with the Bill with regards to freedom of speech and lack of safeguards and ambiguous wording in the Bill that could result in legal action being taken against critics and satirists.\"It is unfortunate that the Australian government cannot distinguish between impersonation and satire. But it is especially worrying because the government has proposed legislation that would impose jail terms for impersonation of a government agency. Some laws against impersonating government officials can be appropriate (Australia, like the U.S., is seeing telephone scams from fraudsters claiming to be tax officials). But the proposed legislation in Australia lacks sufficient safeguards. Moreover, the recent letter to Juice Media shows that the government may lack the judgment needed to apply the law fairly.\"This was a sentiment echoed by Adam Bandt MP in a speech to parliament in which he addressed the topics of freedom of speech and the rights to \"mercilessly troll government\".\n\nSenator Nick McKim is on record as saying: \"\"Where does this leave satire in Australia? Does it mean that figures such as Shaun Micallef, The Juice Media and The Chaser team, as well as upcoming comedians, will have to think twice before they crack jokes lest they find themselves on the stand or in the slammer? As the government's then Attorney-General put it, 'The test of what genuine satire is will be, as I said, up to the courts.' Australian common law has never previously had to deal with defining genuine satire, meaning that satirists will be in the dark as to the potential limits of their jokes until a body of common law has been established\".\"If successfully passed those found to be in breach of the new amendment can face 2–5 years imprisonment\n\nOn 21st June 2018, the Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017 was passed by both Houses and moved into law.\n\nOn 24 January 2017 TJM released a parody of a well known anti-piracy ad, colloquially dubbed \"You Wouldn't Steal a Car\", called Australia Day (Piracy parody). The video compared the celebration of Australia Day (Jan 26), which marks the arrival of the First Fleet, to a number of infamous events in history. The events depicted include Nazi's \"Final Solution\", dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Sep 11 attacks on the Twin Towers.\n\nThe video was released as part of the Change the Date campaign (#changethedate) which calls for changing the date of Australia Day by Aboriginal, Torres Straight Islander and wider community groups.\"Many believe celebrating on January 26 is insensitive as the arrival of the First Fleet marked the beginning of a brutal history which saw mass killings of Indigenous Australians.\"This video incited a great deal of debate, especially in social media, with a lot of negative sentiments expressed especially at the comparison of Jan 26 to other historical dates:\"I understand the sentiment, but these are really poor examples. Not one of these events resulted in the creation of a sustainable society/civilisation,\" Shaun Fielding said.The National Australia Day Council said in response:\"Though 26 January marks this specific event, today Australia Day celebrations reflect contemporary Australia: our diverse society and landscape, our remarkable achievements and our bright future. It also is an opportunity to reflect on our nation's history, and to consider how we can make Australia an even better place in future,\" In 2017 the Australia Day celebrations in Fremantle, Western Australia were cancelled and replaced with more culturally inclusive celebrations 2 days later on Jan 28. This was seen as a litmus test for the #changethedate movement.\n\nAn internet based Australian satirical news show consisting of a rapped \"news report\" with social commentary using comical rap lyrics.\n\nThe Honest Government Ads are filmed in Melbourne, Victoria. They are written by Giordano Nanni who creates the series in collaboration with Lucy Cahill. Actors appearing in the series are credited as Ellen Burbidge, Zoë Amanda Wilson and Matylda Buczko-Koren with Lucy Cahill also being credited with the voice overs.\n\nThese videos are a satirical take on Australian Government advertising. Each video targets a current social or political issue and highlights potential consequences of the Government's position and policy on that issue.\"And an increasingly popular way of sharing the ‘honest truth' about political events is through satirical videos, something that The Juice Media does brilliantly. They bring attention to the ridiculousness of political and worldwide events, not only by making people laugh but by being blunt about what is going on and how people are being taken advantage of. Not everyone agrees with their left wing politics, but it gets people talking.\"In an Al Jazeera English article looking at Satire in the Trump era Giordano Nanni was included in the discussion talking about the use of satire to help keep governments honest. \n\nAs part of the Honest Government ad series TJM has published three ads which are mock tourism ads highlighting the history and ongoing effects of colonial rule in certain countries. These have been produced for Australia, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28924923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28924923", "title": "Thidambu Nritham", "text": "Thidambu Nritham\n\nThidambu Nritham (dance with the replica of the deity) is a ritual dance performed in Temples of North Malabar. This is one among many rich art traditions of North Malabar. It is mainly performed by Namboothiris, and rarely other Brahmin communities like Shivalli, Karhade and Havyaka.\nNorth Malabar is well renowned for its deep rooted culture and tradition. This northern part of present Kerala State is home for several prominent religious destinations that make it a heaven for several unique religious and ritual art forms including Theyyam. Thidambu Nritham is one such ritual art form.\n\nThidambu nritham, as the name conveys, is an elegant dance carrying the decorated image of the deity ( thidambu) on the head.\n\nThis art form is staged both inside and outside the temple. Ten persons are needed for staging this dance. The dance is performed with the decorated deity of the Devi carried on the head. Foot work is most important and this is executed to the rhythms of the drums. Thidambu nritham is commonly performed by Namboothiris (Kerala Brahmins). There shall be seven musicians and two lamp-bearers. All the performers are male. The musicians are from Marar or Pothuval community and the lamp-bearers are from Pushpakan (Unni), Nambeesan, Variar, Unnithiricommunities.\n\nThe dancer wears a striking costume a skirt of pleated cloth, a silk vest, earrings, bangles, necklaces and a decorated turban called ushnipeetam. The performance unfolds in various stages like Urayal, invoking the deity,Thakiladi adantha, Chembada, Pamchan etc. The dancer is usually accompanied by a group of artistes, five of whom play the percussions and two hold aloft the lamps.\n\nThis ritual art form is believed to be over 600–700 years old and follows the principles of dance laid down in Natyasasthra the ancient treatise on performing arts compiled by Sage Bharatha in the second century B.C.\n\nThe origin of Thitambu Nritham cannot be easily traced. Tulu Brahmins who had migrated to the North Malabar during Kolathiri might have introduced this dance from Karnataka where a form of \"Nritham\" called \"Darsana Bali\" was in vogue. Replicas are made of bamboo with which a beautiful frame with intricate designs is created. The priestly dancer, clad in the traditional style after performing the usual rituals, comes out of the sanctorum, and standing under the flag, holds aloft the replica weighing about 10 kg on his head and starts the divine dance.\nAnother legend goes like this : A Namboothiri used to sit in meditation under a nux vomica tree [Botanical name : Stricnos nuxvomica; Mal. - \"Kaanjiram\"]. He had sores all over his body. The fruit that occasionally fell on his body gave him excruciating pain. In agony he cried out a curse : \"Let this tree bear no fruit any longer\". Even today the tree bears no fruit, though it has leaves. It is interesting that during the festival, the dancing Namboothiri priests place the idols of various gods in a small \"Mandapam\" under the tree. People pay obeisance to the deities here.\n\nThidambu Nritham begins with \"Kotti Urayikkal\", drumming in different rhythm, which would persuade the performer and the viewer to an equal extent. The performer will dance with the rhythm holding the “Thidambu” on his head and will create a holy atmosphere.\nThis unique ritual art form has undergone changes over the period of time. Even though the basic concepts of Thidamabu Nritham have not changed, slight change happened in its Thaalam, which has added more novelty and variety to this art.\nThere is no scope for emotional expressions in this art. An exception is famous \"Kootippiriyal\" (parting of lord Krishna and Balarama) at Trichambaram. The occasion is very touching with thousands watching with tearful joy, Krishna and Balarama playing about wildly until the former runs after the milkman carrying milk, and the latter returns to his dwelling some distance away. There is a legend woven round the Thitambu Nritham of Thrichambaram. There was an ardent devotee of lord Krishna - a Namboothiri. He visited the temple everyday, seeking Krishna's blessings. Time flew. He grew old, so old that he could not walk up to the temple half a kilometer away. Inwardly crushed at his physical incapacity, he prayed : \"Krishna, my dear, I cannot come to you; forgive me\". Legend has it that, that night, lord Krishna ran up to him with his brother Balarama and danced along what is called \"Pookkottu Nada\" just in front of the Namboothiri's house. The wonder and delight of the Namboothiri can well be imagined. The famous festival at Trichambaram which goes on from 22nd Kumbham to 6th Meenam (middle March) is in celebration of that event. During the festival, the \"Melsaanthis\" of Trichambaram and Mazhoor (Balarama's temple) hold aloft the replicas of the two deities and dance to the scintillating rhythm of percussion instruments.\nBrahmasree Puthumana Govindan Namboothiri,resident of Puthumana Illam,Chemmattam Vayal,kanhangad is a famous and distinguished thitampu nritham artist (expert) at temples.\n\nBrahmasree Puthumana Govindan Namboothiri (48), is a legend in the field of Thitampu Nritham.He hails from Chemmattam Vayal, kanhangad in Kasaragod district. He has performed at almost all the temples in north Kerala.He is also famous at the National level throughout India. Video clippings of his performance is even included in the topics of interest of the dance researchers in the foreign universities. Thitampu Nritham exponent Sri Govindan Namboothiri, is now also well known for developing and rejuvenating this dance form. He was recently honoured by many organizations for having brought out all the possibilities of this temple dance form.He was given the titles ‘Janakeeya Narthakan’ and ‘Thitampu Nritha Chakravarthy’ for the outstanding and valuable contributions in this field.He has received many honours during the past years from well known temples.He is known to majority of celebrities in other fields as ‘Thitampu Nritha Prathibha’.His style of performing Thitampu Nritham is unique and makes attractive to the viewers even without the knowledge of this divine art. It is always found that there will be a large crowd to watch this performance from areas far away from temples. He keeps all the conventional styles as such with varieties which comes under the new trend. He is becoming popular nowadays as he always sticks only to this art and never tries to copy other dances and art forms.Every year he performs at new temples in North Kerala and Karnataka. He has delighted crowds in various parts of Karnataka including Mangalore and Bangalore apart from the fans in Trivandrum, Kochi, Thrissur and Calicut. It is a measure of his fame that people even from far way places crowd to the temples where he is a performer. Every year Govindan Namboothiri gets invitations from new temples. Such is his popularity.He comes to perform Thitampu Nritham under request which has fascinated thousands of viewers (art lovers) and devotees.He is known as ‘GURUJI’ to the performers of other classical dance forms. A majority of his fans believes that the honors received by him so far is not sufficient to greet him for his excellence and the dedication he shows in this field. \nThere are many senior and great experts in Northern part of Kerala and Southern region of Karnataka performing another ritual, similar in appearance called 'darshanabali'.\n"}

{"id": "4029918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4029918", "title": "Winter guard", "text": "Winter guard\n\nWinter guard is an indoor color guard sport derived from military ceremonies or veterans organizations ceremonies. Unlike traditional color guard, Winter Guard is performed indoors, usually in a gymnasium or an indoor arena. Performances make use of recorded music rather than a live band or orchestra. Winter guard was invented in the United States, which remains the predominant scene for the sport.\n\nWinter Guard ensembles commonly perform at judged competitions officiated by local and regional associations using criteria developed by Winter Guard International. In most states, they have a cadet guard and high school guard.\n\nA Winter Guard generally consists of performing members under the direction of an instructional staff. The staff of a winter guard team (\"the guard\") are drawn from many different specialties, which sometimes overlap: there are equipment instructors (sometimes one for the unit, sometimes broken out into the individual sections), dance instructors, and drill instructors. The equipment instructors create the choreography performed with equipment and teach it to the guard. The dance instructors create and teach the movement choreography in the show. The drill instructors focus on the position of the guard members relative to one another and to the boundaries of the performance area, in addition to where each member goes at which specific time during the performance. In some cases, all of these roles are fulfilled by one sole director.\n\nA winter guard team usually has a captain, who is one of the performing members who leads and represents the guard. The captain may assume minor administrative duties and lead the team when instructors are not available. The captain is also the representative of the guard during awards ceremonies or retreat.\n\nThe number of members on a winter guard team varies widely from five to approximately 45.\n\nThe duration of winter guard shows depends on the class in which the guard is performing. In competition settings, each winter guard team is allotted a set amount of time to set up staging (including a vinyl floor if the guard is using one, and any props associated with the performance), place all equipment, perform the show, and remove staging, props, and equipment. Setup and tear-down typically run two minutes each, and performances run around five minutes. Judges impose penalties on teams that run past the allotted time.\n\nUnlike traditional Color guard (flag spinning) teams, which perform outdoors on a football field or parade route accompanied by a marching band or drum corps, winter guard teams perform indoors to recorded music.\n\nIn competitions, winter guard teams are judged in the areas of talent, precision, creativity, and horizontal orchestration (how all the elements create the larger picture/effect). Performances incorporate equipment, props, and dance moves.\n\nJudges must keep a running commentary on a tape recorder or digital recorder. The judges record the score on a designated sheet to be reviewed by the individual guard instructor(s). After every one in a class has competed and their scores have been tallied, if the instructor(s) so choose they may meet with all the judges to discuss in depth why they received the score they did, ways to improve, what they are doing right etc. The goal of all parties involved, is to have the performers, staff, and the programs grow and learn.\n\nThree primary types of equipment are used in winter guard: flags, rifles, and sabres (other items can be used to demonstrate artistic effects.) Such equipment is used in shows to demonstrate a team's technical ability. Rubber tape, such as electrical tape, is often used to cover the equipment and give it a uniform appearance and protect it from damage during the activity.\n\nThe most fundamental piece of equipment in color guard or winter guard shows is the flag. While winter guard flags take many different sizes and shapes, a standard size is a six-foot pole (metal) with a Three-foot \"silk\", often of a custom design. Smaller flags called \"swing flags\" are shortened poles with large silks connected to them. These poles are often plastic so they move more fluidly. These flags are often incorporated into the artistic element of the performance, even though they are not practical for tossing or spinning, due to the weight and length of the silk. Other flags may range from 5 feet to 7 feet depending upon the intended effect of the piece of equipment. Longer flags are not practical to spin or toss but generally serve as holders for large pieces of material.\n\nShaped similar to actual rifles, the rifles used in winter guard are made of solid or hollowed-out lightweight wood and weigh 2–5 pounds (about 1–2.25 kilograms). Most winter guard rifles have a length of 30–39 inches (about 76–99 centimeters) and are composed of seven parts:\n\nRifles can be made out of both wood and plastic. Some people prefer plastic because they are all the same weight and size, unless you order a bigger or smaller one. Others prefer wood because they're heavier and more durable. They are all exactly the same. Some people prefer wood because it is less slick and they can weight it the way they want to.\n\nUsually rookies, people new to color guard, will use plastic rifles. They tend to be a little more forgiving and easier to handle. Some people may not like plastic rifles because they can become slick and hard to handle, either when its raining or just from the sweat from the users hands. Some plastic rifles come with a manufacture guarantee that they will not break under normal usage. Because most are made out of a material called polyethylene, this makes the rifle sturdy and harder to break. The material can also be colored so that different teams can use different colored rifles. Sometimes, though, the material can warp after several bad drops which can lead to a bad spin while the rifle is in the air. Plastic rifles may also start to smell after prolonged use, some say that after a long time it will tend to smell like sweat because of the performers hands. \n\nWooden rifles can be hard to use because they are all slightly different and may not be weighted the same, this is why people that are more familiar with rifles use them and not usually rookies. Most wooden rifles are made of either poplar or aspen wood. It is recommended to tape wooden rifles as to keep the ends protected and make it more durable, the tape can also be used for cosmetics. Electrical tape is the first choice of most winter guards because you can get the tape in whatever color is desired to match the show. Water is the main antagonist to wooden rifles, it can destroy a rifle and make it completely not usable, but if cared for properly and used correctly they can last for a long time.\n\nSabres are elegant pieces of equipment used in winter guard. The length of sabres can range from about 30–39 inches (about 76–99 centimeters). They can either be plastic, metal, or plastic covered metal- though metal is more commonly used. Some metal sabres on the market are intricately decorated with engravings or etchings along the blade. These more intricately designed sabres tend to be more expensive.\n\nSabres have two main parts: the blade and the hilt. The blade has a pointed but dull end, and the length of the blade is dull as well. Some winter guard team members wrap their sabres in electrical tape, as they do with rifles. As with rifles, a piece of black or non-white tape placed near the center of rotation is used as a \"spotter\", making it easier to locate the fast-moving blade while it is rotating in the air. Sabres are used primarily by more advanced guard members.\n\nGuard members incorporate many different styles of dance into their shows. The most common styles of dance used are modern, contemporary, lyrical, jazz, and ballet. The different styles of dance are chosen depending on the different types of music chosen and the themes of the shows. Dance is usually incorporated into the equipment work, and is performed seamlessly throughout the show.\n\nWinter Guard International is not only a national competition but it is also an organization that has been around for many years. Unlike other traditional sports the rules and regulations have been changed and altered many times since the activity has started. There are judges who judge separate elements of a show – such as general effect, movement, equipment, and penalty points – and score the groups accordingly.\n\nBecause this activity not only exists in the United States but all around the world, major competitions worldwide are sanctioned and managed by Winter Guard International. This is the governing organization that makes and changes the rules and regulations for this activity. The rules that are written by WGI apply to every Winter Guard group competing in the World Championships no matter what country they are from. The World Championships are held every year in the United States. Most recently they have been held at the University of Dayton Arena in Dayton, Ohio with some prelims and semi-finals held elsewhere around the Dayton area and Cincinnati area.\n\nThe phrase \"Sport of the Arts\" is frequently associated with WGI. Winter guard is described by saying \"it brings music to life through performance in a competitive format.\"\n\nBecause not every color guard has the same skill level, population, or resources available, WGI uses a class division system to help remedy this. There are two divisions, Scholastic and Independent. These divisions include the classes (in descending order) Independent: Independent World Class, Independent Open Class, Independent A Class. Scholastic: Scholastic World, Scholastic Open, Scholastic National A Class, Scholastic Regional A, AA, and AAA. Novice Class and Cadet Class.\n\nGuard teams can be chosen to move to a higher class, but they can only move down a class after a period of inactivity or after a WGI review. For every competition, any team which achieves a score higher than a predetermined threshold is automatically moved up, or \"bumped\", to the class above its current position, even mid-season.\n\nThe Scholastic division is made up of guards that have members that all attend the same high school or a feeder school of that high school. There are many colleges and universities that sponsor their own winter guards as well, but these guards typically compete as Independent guards. Scholastic guards vary greatly in their ability and resources because they are more dependent on support from sources other than the members themselves, such as their school's band and school funding.\n\nIn the Scholastic division, there are three classes: Scholastic A, Scholastic Open, and Scholastic World. More divisions may exist at the local/regional level, such as Regional A, or Novice. In many places there is also a middle school class, often called Cadet. Scholastic A teams tend to be a step above the regional level and are the lowest level to compete in WGI. Scholastic Open teams are an intermediate level for competition. The Scholastic World division includes the highest caliber of winter guard teams.\n\nThe Independent division is composed of winter guard teams that do not associate themselves with a school (the exception being university teams). Additionally, these kinds of guards can be much more selective of their members, choosing to be gender-specific or to only have certain numbers of members.\n\nIn the Independent division, much like the Scholastic division, there are the three classes: Independent A, Independent Open and Independent World. The breakdown of skill level and placement mirrors that of the Scholastic division. There are age restrictions in the Independent A and Open classes. A member can perform with an Independent A class group if they are 22 or younger as of March 31 of that year. A member can perform with an Independent Open class group if they are 23 or younger as of March 31 of that year.\n\nAlthough the goal of many winter guards is to compete in the WGI World Championships, most guard competitions take place in regional winter guard circuits. One such circuit is the AIA circuit, or Atlantic Indoor Association circuit in which teams across Virginia, Washington D.C., and North Carolina participate. These circuits are loosely organized and may not be formally affiliated with WGI. In many cases the circuits predate WGI by a number of years. For example, the Midwest Color Guard Circuit celebrated their 50th anniversary season in 2007. They may also have different competitive structures with additional classes to those in WGI. Circuit classes often will include beginner or novice guards such as Cadet, Novice, B, Regional AAA, Regional AA, Regional A, and Regional Open. Circuits generally score using WGI standards and judges whether they are formally affiliated with WGI or not.\n\nIn addition, the winter guard activity is growing outside of the United States. In Europe, Color Guard Nederland (Netherlands) (CGN) and Winter Guard United Kingdom (WGUK) have recently affiliated with organizations from France and Germany to form the European Indoor Arts Alliance (EIAA) with the goal of creating a European Union-wide platform for the growth of the color guard activity in Europe, where the scholastic branch of the activity does not exist.\n\n"}
