{"id": "2190622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2190622", "title": "16 Blocks", "text": "16 Blocks\n\n16 Blocks is a 2006 American action thriller film directed by Richard Donner and starring Bruce Willis, Mos Def, and David Morse. The film unfolds in the real time narration method. It is Donner's final directorial effort, as he retired the same year the film was released.\nJack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is an alcoholic, burned-out NYPD detective. Despite a late shift the night before, his lieutenant orders him to escort a witness, Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), from local custody to the courthouse 16 blocks away to testify on a police corruption case before a grand jury at 10 a.m. Bunker tries to be friendly with Mosley, telling him of his aspirations to move to Seattle to become a cake baker with his sister who he has never met, but Mosley is uninterested, and stops at a liquor store. They are suddenly ambushed by a gunman, and Mosley drags Bunker to a local bar to take shelter and call for backup. Mosley's former partner, Frank Nugent (David Morse), and several other officers arrive. Nugent and his men are part of the corruption scheme, and he tells Mosley that Bunker is not worth defending as his testimony will likely expose several corrupt officers, including Nugent. The corrupt cops try to frame Bunker for firing at an officer before they try to kill him. Mosley intervenes, rescuing Bunker and fleeing.\n\nMosley briefly stops at his sister Diane's (Jenna Stern) apartment to retrieve guns and ammo, and learns the police have already approached her about his activities earlier that day. He and Bunker take steps to further elude the police, and Mosley is wounded in the process. They become cornered in a run-down apartment building as Nugent and his men search floor by floor. Mosley calls the district attorney to arrange for help, but purposely gives the wrong apartment number, suspecting there is a mole involved. Mosley and Bunker are able to escape onto a passenger bus, and as the police follow them, Mosley is forced to treat the passengers as hostages. The bus crashes into a construction site and is soon surrounded by the ESU. Aware that Nugent will likely order the ESU to raid the bus, risking the safety of the passengers, Mosley allows the passengers to go free, using their cover to allow Bunker to sneak off the bus in the confusion. Mosley finds a tape recorder in the discarded possessions on the bus, and prepares a farewell message to Diane.\n\nTo his surprise, Bunker returns to the bus; while Nugent is ready to fire on him, Nugent is made to stand down by a superior officer. Bunker has come to see Mosley as his friend and wants to be there for him to see this through. Bunker's tenacity convinces Mosley to get to the courthouse, and he manages to drive the bus into an alley, temporarily blocking the police from following them. He finds that Bunker has been wounded, and calls Diane, a paramedic, to bring an ambulance around to help, despite knowing she will be followed. Diane cares for Mosley and Bunker's wounds, though Bunker still needs further treatment at a hospital. As Diane's ambulance drives away, the police stop her but discover the ambulance is empty; she had a second ambulance pick up Mosley and Bunker that would not be under similar surveillance. Meanwhile, Mosley reveals to Bunker that should he testify, not only will Nugent be convicted but so would Mosley as one of the corrupt cops. Mosley gets off a block from the courthouse and wishes Bunker luck with his bakery, instructing the paramedic to take Bunker to the Port Authority and put him on a bus for Seattle. Bunker promises to send him a cake on his birthday.\n\nMosley continues to the courthouse, where the police and ESU are waiting for him, as well as the district attorney. Mosley enters the courthouse building through the underground garage, encountering Nugent alone, who tries unsuccessfully to dissuade him from testifying in Bunker's place. Mosley enters the courthouse proper, where one of Nugent's men (David Zayas) tries to shoot Mosley but is killed by one of the ESU snipers. Mosley informs the district attorney that he will testify in exchange for Bunker having his record expunged, also revealing that he had recorded the conversation with Nugent in the garage on the tape recorder, which he submits as evidence.\n\nTwo years later, Mosley is freed from prison. He celebrates his birthday with Diane and other friends, and is surprised to find that the cake had indeed come from Bunker, who has been successful in starting \"Eddie & Jack's Good Sign Bakery\" in Seattle.\n\nWillis originally wanted rapper Ludacris to play the part of Eddie Bunker. \"16 Blocks\" is the second film in which David Morse plays the villain to Bruce Willis as the protagonist; the first was \"12 Monkeys\", in which Morse plays Dr. Peters.\n\nThe film, released by Warner Bros., opened in the United States on March 3, 2006.\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed $12.7 million, which was the second-highest grossing film of the weekend. As of its May 15, 2006 closing date, the film grossed a total of $36.895 million in the U.S. box office. It made $65.6 million worldwide. According to Box Office Mojo, production costs were around $55 million. The film made $51.53 million on rentals, and remained on the DVD top 50 charts for 17 consecutive weeks.\n\nBased on 161 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 56% approval rating from critics, with an average score of 5.9/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Despite strong performances from Bruce Willis and Mos Def, \"16 Blocks\" barely rises above being a shopworn entry in the buddy-action genre.\" Metacritic, which assigns a rating in the 0–100 range based on reviews from top mainstream critics, calculated a score of 63, based on 34 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nMichael Atkinson of \"The Village Voice\" commented that \"the clichés come thick on the ground\" and called it \"a small movie trying to seem epic, or a bloated monster trying to seem lean.\" Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars and called Willis and Mos Def \"a terrific team,\" concluding that \"Until Richard Wenk's script drives the characters into a brick wall of pukey sentiment, it's a wild ride.\" \"Chicago Sun-Times\" critic Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars and commended Mos Def for his \"character performance that's completely unexpected in an action movie,\" while calling the film \"a chase picture conducted at a velocity that is just about right for a middle-age alcoholic.\" Wesley Morris of \"The Boston Globe\" described the film as admirably old fashioned, praising Donner for his direction, but criticized the film for lacking originality, saying it feels like a remake of \"The Gauntlet\" directed by Clint Eastwood.\n\nIn May 2013, Original Entertainment confirmed to have sealed a five-picture deal with Millennium Films to produce Bollywood remakes of \"Rambo\", \"The Expendables\", \"16 Blocks\", \"88 Minutes\", and \"Brooklyn's Finest\", with the productions for \"Rambo\" and \"The Expendables\" expected to start at the end of that year.\n\n"}

{"id": "57558048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57558048", "title": "Bieten", "text": "Bieten\n\nBieten, Laubbieten or Bavarian Poker () is a card game that is popular in the Austrian Tyrol and the Bavarian Prealps. It used to be a game frequently played by timber rafters and muleteers. It can be seen as a precursor to the traditional Tyrolean game of Perlaggen. The unusual feature of Bieten is the nature of the competition. The players have the option, even if they have a poor hand, of persuading their opponent(s) to cave in through skilful bidding (\"Bieten\") and bluffing. \n\nThe aim of each hand is to score points by winning certain 'figures'.\n\nGerman playing cards are used for Bieten. It is usually played by 2 or more players, without partnerships, but 3 or 4 players works best. Of the standard deck of 36 cards, the 6 of Acorns, Leaves and Hearts are removed, leaving only the 6 of Bells, the \"Weli\", in play. The card ranking is as for Watten, i.e. Sow (\"A\") - King - Ober - Unter - 10 - 9 - 8 - 7 - \"Weli\".\n\nIn Austrian Tyrol, William Tell pattern cards (also called \"double German cards\" or \"doppeldeutsche Karten\") are usually used for Bieten, while in South Tyrol the Salzburg pattern is more common.\n\nThe dealer shuffles the cards and gives the player to his right, the opportunity to cut. He then deals clockwise to each player - depending on the game variant - three or four cards (in two packets). Forehand begins by playing a card, the other players follow in clockwise order. Players must follow suit (\"Farbzwang\"), but do not have to take the trick (no \"Stichzwang\"). There are no trumps. \n\nThe winner of the trick is the player who played the highest card of the led suit. The winner leads to the next trick and so on until all the cards have been played. The cards remain face up on the table in front of each player.\n\nDuring the hands, each player has the right, if it is his turn (whether he is leading or not), to bid a 'figure' (\"Figur\") before or after he plays the card to the trick. A precondition is that he holds the figure in question (exception \"Spiel\" – see below) and that the figure has not yet been bid for in this hand. The following 5 figures may be bid for:<ref name=\"Auer52/53\">Auer (2015), pp. 52/53</ref>\n\n\nBidding is initiated e.g. with the words, \"I bid my Hearts\" (\"I biet mein Herz\") or \"My Greens\" (\"meine Grünen\"). The remaining players must respond in clockwise order and have the following options: \n\n\"Spiel\" is a slightly different figure. Each player may, at any time, bid on a \"Spiel\", because no-one knows at the start who will win the last trick. However, once the first card of the last trick is played, players may only bid if they have the same suit.\n\nThe aim of \"Laubbieten\" is to achieve a pre-agreed total number of game points, typically 11, and not to exceed it. At the end of each hand, players count their own points in accordance with the following rules:\n\n\nIf two equally ranked figures occur (e. g. twice 2x10s as a \"Gleich\"), and the figure was held, then Leaves rank higher than Hearts and Hearts rank higher than the other suits. Another variant is that no player gets a point.\n\nThe winner is the player who, after several rounds, is the first to reach the agreed points target, say 11 points, and a small cross is marked in his column on the score sheet. The player with the lowest score is the loser and gets a black spot called a \"Noggele\" or \"Bummerl\". If a player gets close to the target, he may only bid enough so as not to exceed it (i.e. he may not overbid). In the Bavarian Inn Valley, for example, if 11 points is the target, at 10 points one is \"gespannt\" (\"constrained\") and may no longer bid (albeit bids are held). The penalty is a 2 point deduction or the award of 0 points.\n\nTo work out the result of the game, the figures in the last deal are counted in a set order. First, figures that have been bid are scored in the order in which they were first bid; second, the remaining figures are scored in the order: Red, Green, Gleich, Hanger, Spiel.\n\nThe usual penalty for breaches of the rules is a 2-point fine.\n\nIt should be noted that the rules - especially concerning the \"Weli\" - vary from place to place and pub to pub.\n\nJust as the game of Schafkopf has its own language, so Bieten has its own language which is not always fully intelligible to outsiders.\n\nWelibieten is an old variant which may be seen as a simple stepping stone to the more complex game of Perlaggen. Here, the Weli does not score a point for the player holding it, but may instead be used as a wild card at the point when it is played. It may be used as any other card of the player's choice, but ranks immediately below the natural card it represents.\n\nAnother traditional variant was Spitzbieten which took Welibieten one stage further and was actually a simple version of Perlaggen with only three cards. In addition to the Weli, the Seven of Bells and Seven of Acorns were also used as wild cards, called \"Spitzen\". They ranked in the order: 6 \"Weli\", 7, 7. Although simpler than Perlaggen, it is described as a complete and entertaining game for 2 or more players.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42092952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42092952", "title": "Blood Knights", "text": "Blood Knights\n\nBlood Knights is a hack and slash action role-playing game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 (through PlayStation Network), and Xbox 360 (through Xbox Live Arcade). The game was developed by German studio Deck13 Interactive and published by Kalypso Media, also from Germany. \"Blood Knights\" was released on 1 November 2013 for the Xbox 360, 13 November 2013 for the PC, and 19 November 2013 for the PlayStation 3.\n\nThe game features two playable characters: Jeremy, a vampire hunter, and Alysa, a vampire that Jeremy became ritually bound to, on a quest to retrieve an artifact that can cause cataclysms. The game features both single player and local cooperative gameplay (co-op) modes, but does not allow for online co-op. \"Blood Knights\" received generally negative reviews upon release, with a large number of critics faulting the game for showing a lack of creativity and having uninteresting gameplay.\n\nThe game combines platformer, role-playing, and combat elements. Players move about several levels, including a forest and a castle, using precision jumping and puzzle solving to move about the level. Players can discover equipable weapons and armor that improves effectiveness in combat by exploring levels for chests. Combat takes the form of set piece battles, in which a number of enemies appear and must be defeated before the player can continue to progress through the area. These enemies include human outlaws, demons, werewolves, and other vampires. The game also contains boss battles, in which the player must defeat a significantly stronger enemy that is aided by normal enemies.\n\nPlayers assume control of Jeremy, a sword-wielding, melee-focused character, and Alysa, who uses crossbows to deliver ranged attacks. The game can be played as a single player game, in which the player alternates between controlling Jeremy and Alysa, or as a local co-op game, in which two players play cooperatively, with one controlling each character. \"Blood Knights\" does not support online co-op. Like most hack and slash games, the control scheme is minimal. When controlling Jeremy, players can chain attacks using one button (the X button on the Xbox 360), and can use a number of special attacks that have a cooldown timer, including a heavy blow, a whirlwind attack, and a power that draws distant enemies to Jeremy. While controlling Alysa, the game functions as a twin-stick shooter, in which movement is controlled by one thumbstick or set of keys, and firing weapons is controlled by the other thumbstick or another set of keys. Alysa also has special attacks, including the ability to fire flaming arrows and a grenade attack. In single player gameplay, the player can switch between Jeremy and Alysa by pressing a button (the Y button on the Xbox 360). Players can transfer health, in the form of blood, between the two playable characters, healing one at the expense of the other.\n\n\"Blood Knights\" takes place in a fictional version of Earth in which humans and vampires are at war. The main character, Jeremy, is the captain of a holy order that fights vampires. At the beginning of the game, the order travels to a set of ruins to protect the Blood Seal, a powerful artifact, from being captured by the vampires. The order suffers heavy losses in the attempt, and in desperation the priest Bartholomew uses a ritual to bind Jeremy to the vampire Alysa. During the course of Jeremy's attempt to retrieve the seal, he is turned into a vampire, and the vampires seize the seal themselves. With the seal removed from its resting place, the moon begins to crack apart, causing unpredictable and violent tides. Because Jeremy has been turned into a vampire himself, Bartholomew and another member of the holy order, Castello, kick Jeremy and Alysa into an abyss inside the ruins, abandoning them for dead. Castello assumes Jeremy's place as the captain of the order.\n\nJeremy and Alysa escape the ruins and pursue the vampires that stole the Blood Seal. Castello and the holy order are also pursuing the vampires. Jeremy and Alysa reach Godskeep, a human stronghold. In order to pass through the town, the pair must first rescue the town's sheriff, who went into a nearby forest with the town guard in an attempt to kill the powerful vampire Blood Fox. Jeremy and Alysa defeat Blood Fox, and in the town, Jeremy encounters Bartholomew, who split from Castello after an argument. Bartholomew tasks Jermey with recovering the Relic of Light, a powerful weapon that can be used against the vampires, in order to prove that Jeremy is still loyal to the order.\n\nAfter retrieving the weapon, Jeremy is informed that the Lords of Pikehold, a group of knights that defends the area, have defeated the vampire army carrying the blood seal. On his way to Pikehold Castle, Jeremy is then ambushed by Castello. The pair fight Castello, who falls off a cliff after being defeated. Inside Pikehold Castle, Jeremy discovers that the Lords of Pikehold have become thralls to a succubus. Jeremy and Alysa defeat the Lords of Pikehold and the succubus, who informs Jeremy that the Blood Seal has been taken by a vampire mage to the top of a mountain.\n\nBartholomew meets Jeremy and Alysa at the top of the mountain, and informs the pair that the vampires have already summoned a powerful demon that will slaughter mankind. Bartholomew has called upon the army of Rome, led by the powerful First Paladin of Rome, to defeat the demon. Jeremy, knowing that the First Paladin of Rome would kill him and Alysa on sight, sets off to defeat the demon before the army of Rome arrives. When Jeremy and Alysa confront the demon, it explains that it was summoned because the humans have become too numerous, and with increased numbers they have gone from fearing vampires to hunting them. Jeremy and Alysa kill the demon and Bartholomew recovers the Blood Seal. As he does this, the First Paladin of Rome arrives and demands the seal for himself. Bartholomew gives the seal to Jeremy instead, and battles the Paladin to delay the army of Rome.\n\nJeremy travels back to the ruins from the beginning of the game, only to find that the army of Rome has beaten him there. Jeremy and Alysa meet the First Paladin in the Blood Seal's resting chamber. The Paladin explains that he wishes to destroy the seal, causing a great deluge that will bring the people, who had stopped believing the Church's teachings, back under the Church's influence. Jeremy refuses to allow the Paladin to do this, and the Paladin attacks. After being injured, the Paladin pulls back and Castello appears and attacks. Jeremy and Alysa kill Castello, and the Paladin re-enters the fight. Jeremy and Alysa appear to severely wound the First Paladin, but he boasts that vampires cannot kill him, as he is under the protection of Rome. Bartholomew emerges from behind the Blood Seal's resting place and slits the First Paladin's throat from behind, killing him. Bartholomew claims that although the Blood Seal was destroyed in battle, the moon will heal itself. He reveals that while he has heard that it can be done, he does not personally know how to turn Jeremy back into a human, and unless he is human, the bond between him and Alysa cannot be undone. The game ends with Jeremy and Alysa agreeing to work together to find a way to reverse Jeremy's transformation into a vampire.\n\n\"Blood Knights\" went through a number of delays before being published. Announced by German publisher dtp entertainment in July 2012, the game was originally scheduled for release in the summer of 2012. In a Game Informer article published on 3 September 2012, the release date was given as 31 October 2012 (Halloween). This date was later shifted back to December 2012, citing \"legal negotiations\", and then to 20 February 2013, citing a need for more development time. 20 February passed with neither the release of the game nor an announcement by the developer or publisher, although both Xbox.com and Amazon.de now listed release dates in mid-march. Developer Deck13 Interactive then announced a release date of 19 March 2013. On 5 March 2013, Deck 13 founder Jan Klose explained that the release date remained uncertain, expecting the game to be released no later than mid-May 2013. Klose called the game 99.9% complete, and blamed the delays on financial difficulties at dtp entertainment, which necessitated that Deck 13 become a co-publisher and take on responsibilities that the studio not planned for. The game was eventually released by a different publisher, Kalypso Media, as the first game under their digital-only label \"Kobolt Games\". The game was finally released on 1 November 2013 for the Xbox 360, 13 November 2013 for the PC, and 19 November 2013 for the PlayStation 3.\n\n\"Blood Knights\" received mixed to poor reviews upon release. At Metacritic, a video game review aggregator, the Xbox 360 version of the game received an average score of 45 out of 100, based on 7 reviews. The UK \"Official Xbox Magazine\" remarked that \"\"Blood Knights\" holds as much annoyance as satisfaction\", while the US version of \"Official Xbox Magazine\" contended that \"\"Blood Knights\" is too easy to ever become actively irritating, but its deficit of danger makes it too darn \"dull\" to hold even a devoted horror nut’s attention for long\".\n\nCritics took issue with the game's lack of originality. Henry Kelly of \"The Digital Fix\" comments that \"The character models are quite basic and unimaginative - Jeremy has typically harsh features and the female characters are given skimpy outfits to show off their stereotyped fantasy physiques\". \"X-ONE Magazine\" calls the game an \"unashamed clone of \"Diablo\"\", which borrows mechanics, naming conventions, and character archetypes from \"Diablo\". The gameplay was considered by critics to be too easy, with a terrible enemy AI that made combat unchallenging, interspersed with what Henry Kelly called \"painfully simple non-puzzles\". Other components that faced criticism included the shallowness of the RPG elements, the lack of online co-op, and the dialogue, which was considered poorly written and occasionally poorly acted.\n\nReviewers did, however, have positive things to say about the game's co-op system, lack of online support notwithstanding. Cameron Lewis of \"Official Xbox Magazine\" US, in the summary of his review, noted that \"complementary characters make local co-op effective\". The UK version of the magazine called the co-op \"pleasant\", while \"X-ONE Magazine\" felt that the mode gave the game more substance.\n"}

Zuiker. Starring American recording artist Britney Spears and her then-husband Kevin Federline, the five-episode series aired on UPN from May 17 to June 14, 2005. The series chronicles the couple's relationship from their courtship, engagement and wedding.\n\nA majority of the footage was originally shot for Spears' own reality series to document the European leg of The Onyx Hotel Tour in the spring of 2004. Spears fell and injured her left knee during the shooting of the music video for \"Outrageous\", causing the remainder of the tour and the series to be cancelled.\n\n\"Britney and Kevin: Chaotic\" was heavily criticized by critics, who considered the series to be career suicide for Spears. Critics noted Spears' excessive narcissism and criticized the themes of the series as being too explicit. The DVD release of \"Britney and Kevin: Chaotic\" included Spears' first extended play of .\n\nMTV News announced in April 2004 that Spears was planning a reality television series to document her backstage life during the European leg of The Onyx Hotel Tour. Pitched as \"OnTourage\", footage from the six-week leg was to be compiled into a six-episode series, with each episode selling for about $1 million, \"much more than most reality programs\". Spears was to narrate and shoot footage of her with her dancers and handlers. The show was planned to be completed \"as early as summer\".\n\nOn June 8, Spears was shooting the music video for \"Outrageous\" in Queens, when she fell and injured her left knee. She was taken immediately to a local hospital and underwent arthroscopic surgery the next day. She was forced to remain six weeks with a knee brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused any future concerts to be canceled. As a result, \"OnTourage\" was also scrapped.\n\nIn July, Spears announced her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline, whom she had met three months before. As Federline had only recently ended his relationship with actress Shar Jackson, who was pregnant with their second child, this engagement was the subject of extensive media coverage. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement. In October 2004, the singer announced she would be taking another career break to start a family.\n\nAfter a \"fierce bidding war\", on April 5, 2005, it was announced that Spears had signed a deal with UPN to air a reality television series documenting her relationship with Federline. The series, which would air in five episodes, was revealed to chronicle the relationship \"from the earliest stages of their courtship to their engagement and ultimately, their stroll down the aisle\". In a statement about the series, Spears stated: \"From the day that Kevin and I met, there have been constant rumors and inaccurate speculation about our lives together. I feel that last year, the tabloids ran my life, and I am really excited about showing my fans what really happened, rather than all the stories, which have been misconstrued by journalists in the past. As I mentioned before, I am now going to be expressing my personal life through art\".\n\nThe series was initially titled \"Britney and Kevin: Can You Handle Our Truth?\", before its title was changed to \"Britney and Kevin: Chaotic\", with \"Can you handle our truth?\" becoming its tagline. All of the footage shot for \"OnTourage\" was used for \"Britney and Kevin: Chaotic\". According to Spears, the series helped the couple to know each other more, saying: \"I didn't know [Kevin] that well, and when I got the camera out, it made me feel better. It's really weird because it was like all this tension at first. We were so nervous being together. I'm really shy, and when I had the camera in my hand, it made me feel more outspoken.\"\n\n\"Britney and Kevin: Chaotic\" was heavily criticized by critics. Taylor Carik of \"Flak Magazine\" considered the series an \"insult to common sense and decency\", while commenting that \"Britney's ridiculous behavior in \"Chaotic\" confirms the obvious transparency of her status as a 'celebrity product' and the calculated nature of her success\". He also noted that music critics would \"easily open the floodgates for new and creative ways to discuss her offense to pop culture's attempts at meaningfulness\". Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk reviewed the series as an \"absolute disaster of the highest order\", while writing that: \"[\"Britney & Kevin: Chaotic\"] is an absolutely watchable and horrifying train wreck of a series\". Slant Magazine writer Ed Gonzalez noted that \"the show's extreme shooting style makes it especially hard to stare at what is—no more no less—a totem to the pop singer's narcissism\". He stated that the views Spears expresses in the series suggest that she is \"someone who believes they're the only person on the face of the earth\". \n\nJosh Wolk of \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt that \"Britney and Kevin: Chaotic\" was Spears' \"career suicide by videocam\", commenting, \"the truth is not only that she's vapid, but that she's self-obsessed to a dangerous degree\". Wolk also noted \"many intersecting things wrong on this show and with Britney that I can't possibly prioritize them\". Laura Fries of \"Variety\" perceived the series as \"a visual assault of nauseating camera angles, likely to upset even the most desensitized TV viewer\". Hayley Butler of Jam! gave the final episode of the series a mixed review, saying it \"was full of tear-jerking moments\" and \"the only episode not full of stupid jokes, childish behaviour and Britney's thoughts on life\", commenting that Spears and Federline wedding scenes \"looked to be a very emotional and touching event\". Butler also wondered \"if they feel their show served its purpose\".\n\nDuring a 2013 interview, Spears described the series as \"the worst thing I’ve done in my career\", and said: \"I would never do something like that again.\"\n\nThe first episode of the series was seen by 3.7 million viewers, making it UPN's most-watched piece of regularly scheduled programming in the 9pm Tuesday timeslot since March 2004. The second episode garnered 3 million viewers, finishing in eighty-first in its timeslot for the week. The third and fourth episode were viewed by 2.5 million viewers each, while the final, aired an hour earlier at 8:00pm Eastern Standard Time, drew 2.1 million viewers. In one month, \"Britney and Kevin: Chaotic\" lost 1.6 million viewers.\n\n<onlyinclude>\n</onlyinclude>\n\n\"Britney & Kevin: Chaotic... the DVD & More\" was released on September 27, 2005 in the United States.

{"id": "88947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=88947", "title": "Charango", "text": "Charango\n\nThe charango is a small Andean stringed instrument of the lute family, which probably originated in the Quechua and Aymara populations in post-Colombian times, after European stringed instruments were introduced by the Spanish during colonialization. The instrument is widespread throughout the Andean regions of Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, northern Chile and northwestern Argentina, where it is a popular musical instrument which exists in many variant forms.\n\nAbout 66 cm [26 inches] long, the charango was traditionally made with the shell from the back of an armadillo (\"quirquincho\", \"mulita\"), but also it can be made of wood, which some believe to be a better resonator. Wood is more commonly used in modern instruments. Charangos for children may also be made from calabash. Many contemporary charangos are now made with different types of wood. It typically has 10 strings in five courses of 2 strings each, but many other variations exist.\n\nThe charango was primarily played in traditional Andean music, but is more and more frequently being used by other Latin American musicians. A charango player is called a \"charanguista\".\n\nWhen the Spanish \"conquistadores\" came to South America, they brought the vihuela (an ancestor of the classical guitar) with them. It is not clear whether the charango is a direct descendent of a particular Spanish stringed instrument; it may have evolved from the vihuela, bandurria (mandolin), or the lute. Ernesto Cavour, charanguista, composer, and consulting music historian for many museums around the world, has noted characteristics of the charango in various vihuelas and guitars of the 16th century, and maintains the charango is the direct descendent of the vihuela.\n\nThere are many stories of how the charango came to be made with its distinctive diminutive soundbox of armadillo. One story says that the native musicians liked the sound the vihuela made, but lacked the technology to shape the wood in that manner. Another story says that the Spaniards prohibited natives from practicing their ancestral music, and that the charango was a successful attempt to make a lute that could be easily hidden under a garment such as a poncho.\n\nThere is no clear evidence that points to a specific location or moment in time for the birth of the charango but there are a number if theories being debated. One of those is that it is believed the charango came into its present form in the early part of the 18th century in the city of Potosi in the Royal Audiencia of Charcas part of the Viceroyalty of Peru (in what is present-day Bolivia), probably from Amerindian contact with Spanish settlers. Cavour presents evidence from Bolivian murals and sculptures as far back as 1744—in, for example, the Church of San Lorenzo of the city of Potos (Potosí), the facade of which depicts two mermaids playing what he believes to be charangos.\n\nAnother two theories that are being researched are that the Charango originally came to what is now known as modern day Potosi Bolivia, from the Ayacucho region in Colonial Peru as a result of migrations from the quechua populations. This would posit that the charango originated in what is a territory within modern day Peru from the process of cultural miscegenation and then spread to the rest of the Andean area. This theory has not been proven either.\n\nBecause in those times neither Peru nor Bolivia were established as Republics, pinning the Charango's origin to a modern day country is therefore problematic and a highly debated issue among nationalists from both countries.\n\nOne Bolivian musician has posited a third theory which is that the Charango was created as a variant of the timple canario from the Canary islands. More research however is required.\n\nThe first published historic information on the charango may be that gathered by Vega, going back to 1814, when a cleric from Tupiza documented that \"the Indians used with much enthusiasm the guitarrillos mui fuis... around here in the Andes of Bolivia they called them Charangos\". Turino mentions that he found carved sirens representing playing charangos in some Colonial churches in the highlands of Bolivia. One of the churches to which Turino refers may well be that mentioned by Cavour; construction on the San Lorenzo edifice began in 1547 and wasn't completed until 1744.\n\nAccording to Eduardo Carrasco of Quilapayún, in the first week after the 1973 Chilean coup d'etat, the military organized a meeting with folk musicians where it was explained that the traditional instruments charango and quena were now banned.\n\nThe origin of the term \"charango\" is not entirely clear. One source suggests that the instrument took its name from its players, who were called \"charangeros\", meaning \"someone of questionable character and low morals\". Another traces the term to the alteration of a Spanish term, \"charanga\", which could refer to either a type of military music played on wind instruments, or an out-of-tune orchestra. Charanguista Alfredo Coca, offers yet a third theory: asserting that \"charango\" comes from a Spanish corruption of the Quechua word “Chajwaku”, which means joy, noisy, boisterous, referring directly to the sound of the charango. As support for this he points to the common practice of the Conquistadors appropriating local terminology.\n\nCharanguista Ernesto Cavour disagrees, and tends to support the second origin, maintaining that the word “charango” comes from a mispronunciation of the Spanish word “charanga”, meaning \"brass band\" (a reasonable corollary to 'military music played on wind instruments').\n\nOne of the most complete contemporary statements on the origin of the term \"charango\" appears in the introduction to Duran and Pedrotti's, \"Charango Method\", ostensibly the first complete, bilingual charango method to be published:\n\nTraditionally a charango was made with a dried armadillo shell for the back and wood for the soundbox top, neck etc. While still common, this is no longer the norm: rather they are now typically made of wood, with the bowled back merely imitating the shape of the armadillo shell. Unlike most wooden lutes, the body and neck are typically made of a single block of wood, carved into shape. The charango's ten strings require quite a large headstock, often approaching or even exceeding the size of its diminutive sound box. Aside from these visual distinctions, it resembles something between a bowl-backed mandolin and a small ukulele.\n\nThe overall length of a typical charango is about 66 cm, with a string scale length of about 37 cm. The number of frets ranges from five to eighteen. The most common form of the instrument has ten strings of nylon, gut, or (less commonly) metal. (Variant forms of the charango may have anywhere from four to fifteen strings, in various combinations of single, double, or triple courses.) The body generally has a narrowed \"waist\", reminiscent of the guitar family, and not the pear-shape of the lute. There are many minor variations in the shape of the body and soundboard (top), and many different kinds of wood are used, although, like guitars, the preferred tone woods for the top come from the cedar or spruce families. Old instruments had friction-style tuning pegs (similar to those used on violins), but today a classical guitar style peghead with geared \"machine\" tuners is the norm, though these are occasionally positioned perpendicular to the headstock. Most instruments include some degree of ornamentation, which may range from simple purfling inlays around the perimeter of the top, to elaborately carved headstocks, and whole scenes engraved, carved, or burned into the back of the body. Strap buttons are sometimes added, as are position marker dots on the fingerboard.\n\nVariations may include a separate glued-on neck, a two-piece top plate of contrasting woods, old-style friction tuning pegs in palisander or ebony, guitar-style box construction, or even a hollowed-out neck. The size, shape, and number of soundholes is highly variable and may be a single round or oval hole, dual crescents, or even multiple holes of varying arrangement. Another variant is a neck with two holes bored 3/4 of the way through, parallel to the fretboard and close to the headstock (an innovation said to color the instrument's tone).\n\nMore recently solid-body electric and hollow-body acoustic-electric charangos have become available. The solid-body instruments are built very much as miniature electric guitars, whereas the acoustic-electrics are usually a standard acoustic charango with the addition of a contact microphone or piezoelectric pickup to run the output of the instrument through an amplifier.\n\nIn his book \"The Motorcycle Diaries\", Che Guevara describes an instrument that he identified as a charango while near Temuco, Chile, in 1952. It was \"made with three or four wires some two meters in length stretched tightly across tins fixed to a board. The musician uses a kind of metal knuckle duster with which he plucks the wires producing a sound like a toy guitar.\"\n\nThe basic charango has five pairs (or courses) of strings, typically tuned GCEAE. This tuning, disregarding octaves, is similar to the typical C-tuning of the ukulele or the Venezuelan cuatro, with the addition of a second E-course. Unlike most other stringed instruments, all ten strings are tuned inside one octave. The five courses are pitched as follows (from 5th to 1st course): G4 G4 - C5 C5 - E5 E4 - A4 A4 -E5 E5. Some \"charanguistas\" use \"octave\" strings on other pairs in addition to the middle course. Note that the lowest pitch is the \"E\" string in the middle (3rd) course, preceded by the higher pitched \"g\" (5th) course and \"c\" (4th) course, and followed by still higher pitched \"a\" (2nd) course and \"e\" (1st) courses. This tuning pattern is known as a re-entrant pattern because the pitches of the strings do not rise steadily from one string or course to the next, but progress from high to low and then back to high pitch again.\n\nThe ramifications of the charango tuning are that there is a very narrow tonal range in most chords, often with many pitch duplications, which produces a surprisingly powerful sound from the small instrument. Seventh and ninth chords shimmer more than on a guitar due to the close harmonies. In terms of melody playing, the \"charanguista\" can create a harp-like sound with close intervals ringing out (i.e., like a piano with the sustain pedal engaged). With the close pitch spacing across strings (intervals like 2nds), a simple alternating finger-style pattern in the right hand can produce very rapid chromatic and diatonic runs with only minimal movement of the left hand on the fingerboard. This makes the charango an extremely agile melodic instrument, especially when compared to instruments traditionally played with a flat pick.\n\nAs with any stringed instrument, tunings for the charango may vary, but the \"standardized\" tunings most commonly used (for the 10-stringed, five-course version) are:\n\nG#m7 and Gm7 tunings are achieved by tuning a semitone or a full step down, respectively. Em7 is achieved by tuning down by a perfect fourth.\n\nThere are metal string, nylon/gut string, and mixed-string charangos. Some metal-stringed versions have all strings at the same gauge. There are also solid-body electric charangos.\n\nThere are many types of charango. In many cases the variant is named for the town or region in which it originated, or in which it is most frequently seen (e.g., the \"Charango Ayquileño\" of Ayquile, Bolivia). The number of strings on these variant instruments ranges from 4 to 20, and courses may be single, double, triple, or quadruple strung. (The standard charango has 10 strings in 5 courses of 2 strings each.)\n\nSome types of charango are:\n\n\nOther, less common members of the charango family include:\n\nAs one of the most popular stringed instruments in regions along the Andes, countless other regional variations of the charango exist, for example:\nSeveral hybrids of charango with other instruments have also been made, for example: \"charanquena\" (charango and quena); \"charansicu\" (charango and zampoña); and \"charango charanguita\" (charango and guitar).\n\nThe charango is known by different names in various regions of the Andes. A few include:\n\nThere are also many dialect variants of these terms.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Currently there is a commercial requirement text for 3D TV broadcasters and Set-top box manufacturers, but no technical information is in there.\n\nNowadays 3D television technology is already in its first steps regarding its standardization, now the major 3D market is in theaters and Blu-ray Disc players with stereoscopic systems, but in the near future it will be extended to diffusion, and later Free viewpoint television will come into our homes, which means the need of new coding and transmission standards.\n\nThe implantation of first generation of DVB 3D-TV will be staggered:\n\n\nMatrix of signal formats for 3DTV:\nRegarding how a signal once it's decoded is sent to the display, current stereoscopic systems use a frame-sequential 3D signal. Left and right frames are sent alternately to the display and by diverse systems like shuttered glasses or polarized glasses are then shown to each eye. This involves that the real frame frequency halves the video frame frequency.\n\nIn Phase 1 system, only frame-sequential 3D is allowed, using frame compatible (CFC) format. This is made by a spatial multiplex that combines the left and right video sequences in one HD stream which is coded with H.264 as a single image. This allows to handle video as normal HD video using typical channels and interfaces like HDMI, which is possible in this 1.4a version. Frame compatible (CFC) model is also compatible with 2D HD mode in the same channel, adding some signalling for switching from 2D to 3D.\n\nThere are basically two ways to do spatial multiplex: Side by side and Top and bottom, but additional spatial multiplex formats have been proposed in order to improve picture quality by providing a better balance between the V and H resolution.\n\nSide by side (SbS) format just put the left and right images one next to the other in an HD image. Because of this, an horizontal decimate is required which causes halving of horizontal definition. DVB 3D-TV supports following SbS formats:\n\nTop and Bottom (TaB) format put left and right images one above the other in a HD image. In this case, vertical decimate is required which causes halving of vertical definition. DVB 3D-TV supports following TaB formats:\n\n\nThere are basically two types of text displayed on screen that need additional broadcasting information to be displayed on a 3D display:\n\n\nThe main function of signaling for frame compatible 3DTV is to signal the presence of a 3D or 2D video stream. It must be also possible to include in the broadcast signal information about the pixel arrangement used to decimate the master HDTV full samples/line pictures to create the anamorphic version, if 3D is available. It's interesting to signal also for 3D receivers the 3D events that are available, for which 3D availability should appear on EPG.\nFor future service compatible (CSC) 3DTV, signal that a 3D version of a 2D service or event is being simulcast, and vice versa will be needed.\n\nMultiview video coding is a compression standard appended from H.264/MPEG-4 AVC which allows send stereoscopic 3D video without resolution loss due to spatial multiplex, and reducing overhead of sending 2 HD images up to 50% and in a single video stream. It is used in Blu-ray players, but at the moment it's not applicable to broadcast because of the processing time for encoding, which uses motion compensation algorithms. Nevertheless, there have been some experiments with MVC 3D broadcast by Fraunhofer society over 2nd generation DVB (DVB-T2, DVB-C2 and DVB-S2).\n\nTotal Free viewpoint television can be reached by capturing multiple views and extracting 2D+depth information from them to create a 3D model of the scene. Currently this system is being investigated, but the coding complexity and great bandwidth requirements make current broadcasting applications using Multiview Video Coding impractical, so a totally new compression scheme and capture techniques need to be investigated.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "550955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=550955", "title": "Danzón", "text": "Danzón\n\nDanzón is the official musical genre and dance of Cuba. It is also an active musical form in Mexico, and is still much loved in Puerto Rico. \nWritten in time, the danzón is a slow, formal partner dance, requiring set footwork around syncopated beats, and incorporating elegant pauses while the couples stand listening to virtuoso instrumental passages, as characteristically played by a charanga or tipica ensemble.\n\nThe danzón evolved from the Cuban contradanza, or habanera (literally, 'Havana-dance'). The contradanza, which had English and French roots in the country dance and contredanse, was probably introduced to Cuba by the Spanish, who ruled the island for almost four centuries (1511–1898), contributing many thousands of immigrants. It may also have been partially seeded during the short-lived British occupation of Havana in 1762, and Haitian refugees fleeing the island's revolution of 1791–1804 brought the French-Haitian kontradans, contributing their own Creole syncopation. In Cuba, the dances of European origin acquired new stylistic features derived from African rhythm and dance to produce a genuine fusion of European and African influences. African musical traits in the danzón include complex instrumental cross-rhythms, expressed in staggered cinquillo and tresillo patterns.\n\nBy 1879, the year Miguel Failde's \"Las alturas de Simpson\" was first performed (in Matanzas), danzón had emerged as a distinct genre. Danzón went on to interact with 20th-century Cuban genres such as son, and through the danzón-mambo it was instrumental in the development of mambo and cha-cha-chá.\n\nThe danzón developed from the habanera, a creolized Cuban dance form. By 1879, the year \"Las alturas de Simpson\" composed by Miguel Failde (leader of the Orquesta Faílde) was first performed in Matanzas, danzón had emerged as a distinct genre. Creation of the new danzón form is generally attributed to Faílde. The classical composer Manuel Saumell has also been cited as a key figure in its delineation.\n\nThe English contradanza was the predecessor of the \"habanera\", also known as danza criolla. Out of this Creole genre, the Habanera, was born in 1879 another Cuban genre, called danzon, a sequence dance, in which all danced together a set of \"figures\". The first use of the term \"danzón\", which dates from the 1850s, is for just such a dance. Havana's daily paper, \"El Triunfo\", gave a description of this earlier\ndanzón. It was a co-ordinated dance of figures performed by groups of Matanzas blacks. The dancers held the ends of colored ribbons, and carried flower-covered arches. The group twisted and entwined the ribbons to make pleasing patterns. This account can be corroborated by other references, for example, a traveler in Cuba noted in 1854 that black Cubans \"do a kind of wreath dance, in which the whole company took part, amid innumerable artistic entanglements and disentanglements\". This style of danzón was performed at carnival comparsas by black groups: it is described that way before the late 1870s.\n\nFaílde's first danzóns were created for just such sequence dances. Faílde himself said \"In Matanzas at this time there was a kind of square dance for twenty couples who carried arches and flowers. It was really a dance of figures (sequence dance), and its moves were adapted to the tempo of the habanera, which we took over for the danzón.\"\n\nThe form of danzón created by Miguel Faílde in 1879 (\"Las alturas de Simpson\"), begins with an \"introduction\" (four bars) and \"paseo\" (four bars), which are repeated and followed by a 16-bar melody. The introduction and paseo again repeat before a second melody is played. The dancers do not dance during these sections: they choose partners, stroll onto the dance floor, and begin to dance at precisely the same moment: the fourth beat of bar four of the paseo, which has a distinctive percussion pattern that's hard to miss. When the introduction is repeated the dancers stop, chat, flirt, greet their friends, and start again, right on time as the paseo finishes.\n\nEarly danzón was played by groups called \"orquestas típicas\", which were based on wind instruments. They had several brass instruments (cornet, valve trombone, ophicleide), a clarinet or two, a violin or two and tympani (kettle drums). At the beginning of the 20th century, the lighter and somewhat more elegant sound of the \"charanga\" emerged (see Early Cuban bands). Initially, they were small orchestra of two violins, a cello, flute, timbales, güiro, and doublebass. Charanga and típicas competed with each other for years, but after 1930 it was clear that the days of the típica were over.\n\nIn 1898, a piano was included in a charanga for the first time. In Antonio María Romeu's hands a piano became standard. Its musical flexibility, its ability to influence both melody and rhythm, made it invaluable. In 1926, in his arrangement of \"Tres lindas cubanas\", Romeu incorporated a piano \"solo\" for the first time. His was Cuba's top charanga for many years.\n\nSimilar to other dances in the Caribbean and Latin America, the danzón was initially regarded as scandalous, especially when it began to be danced by all classes of society. The slower rhythm of the danzón led to couples dancing closer, with sinuous movements of the hips and a lower centre of gravity. The author of a survey of prostitution in Havana devoted a whole chapter to the iniquities of dancing, and the danzón in particular. Articles in newspapers and periodicals took up the theme:\n\nApparently, the danzón, which later became an insipid dance for older couples, was at first danced with \"obscene movements\" of the hips by young couples in close embrace, with bodies touching, and by couples who might come from different races...\n\nSo, behind the concern about music and dance were concerns about sexual licence, and about miscegenation, the mixing of races. As with other similar cases, the criticism was to no avail. The danzón became hugely popular, and was the dominant popular music in Cuba until the advent of the son in the 1920s. At length the Cuban government made Faílde the official inventor of the danzón – \"but not until 1960\", by which time the danzón had become a relic, and its 'child', the chachachá, had taken over.\n\nIn 1910, some 30 years after Faílde's early days, José Urfé added a montuno as a final part of his \"El Bombín de Barretto\". This was a swinging section, consisting of a repeated musical phrase, which introduced something of the son into the danzón (a tactic which was to recur again). Because of the popularity of son in the 1920s and 1930s, Aniceto Díaz in \"Rompiendo la rutina\" in 1929 added a vocal part, thereby creating a new genre called the danzonete.\n\nLater development led to more syncopation, which eventually led to the danzón-chá, nuevo ritmo, cha-cha-chá, pachanga and mambo. From the 1940s to the 1960s danzón and its derivatives were highly popular in Cuba, with several truly fine charangas playing most days of the week. Orquesta Aragón kept up an exceptionally high standard for many years, but the danzón itself gradually dropped out, and is now a relic dance.\n\nDanzón has never ceased to influence Cuban musicians, and it is reflected in many popular Cuban music genres, in Cuban Latin jazz, salsa, songo and timba, the latter building upon the charanga orchestration. Groups like Los Van Van and Orquesta Revé developed from charangas. Their make-up and orchestration (by Juan Formell) has been so greatly altered that it is difficult to identify traces of danzón; indeed, their present styles owe more to son than to danzón. The addition of brass instruments such as trombones and trumpets, and conga drums signalled a wider range of music.\n\nDanzón was also very popular in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, Mexico, because of the strong Cuban influence in the region. Later on, danzón developed in Mexico City, specially in the famous \"Salón México\"; it has survived as a dance longer there than in Cuba. Danzón also flourished in the city of Oaxaca, and many famous danzones were composed by Oaxacan musicians such as the famous Nereidas and Teléfono de larga distancia, both works of Amador Pérez Dimas, from the town of Zaachila, near Oaxaca city.\n\nToday, people still dance danzón in Mexico, particularly in the main plazas of Veracruz, Oaxaca and Mexico City, and in yearly festivals across Mexico. The dance had a second revival in the 1990s, especially among Mexico's senior citizens.\n\nA film called \"Danzón\" was released in 1991 directed by María Novaro. Plot: Julia (María Rojo) is a phone operator in Mexico City who lives for her job, her daughter and danzón. Every Wednesday, Julia does the danzón with Carmelo (Daniel Rergis) in the \"Salón Colonia\". They have danced for years without becoming close. One night, Carmelo disappears without a trace. Lonely and sad, Julia takes a train to Veracruz, where she knows Carmelo has a brother. That trip changes her life.\n\n\"Danzón no. 2\" by Mexican composer Arturo Márquez (b. 1950) is a popular piece in orchestral concerts.\n\nThe basic timbales part for danzón is called the baqueteo. In the example above, the slashed noteheads indicate muted drum strokes, and the regular noteheads indicate open strokes. The güíro also plays this pattern. The danzón was the first written music to be based on the organizing principle of sub-Saharan African rhythm, known in Cuba as clave.\n\nDanzón is elegant and virtuoso music, with dance. A danzón, in its original form, was not sung, and did not feature any improvisations, unlike some other Cuban genres.\nA danzón has the following typical structure:\nThe classic form is thus ABAC or ABACA.\nA danzón-chá or danzón-mambo typically add another part (D), a syncopated open vamp in which soloists may sometimes improvise, creating an ABACD or, more common, ABACAD.\n\nIn danzón, the mambo section is the final section of an arrangement. It was first devised by Orestes López, who added syncopated motifs taken from the son, together with improvised flute variations. He called this type of danzón \"ritmo nuevo\" (new rhythm). Orestes' danzón \"Mambo\" was the start of a trend continued by \"Arcaño y sus Maravillas\".\n\n\n"}

Modern dominoes first appeared in Italy during the 18th century, but how Chinese dominoes developed into the modern game is unknown. Italian missionaries in China may have brought the game to Europe.\n\nThe name \"domino\" is most likely from the resemblance to a kind of carnival costume worn during the Venetian Carnival, often consisting of a black-hooded robe and a white mask. Despite the coinage of the word polyomino as a generalization, there is no connection between the word \"domino\" and the number 2 in any language.\n\nEuropean-style dominoes are traditionally made of bone or ivory, or a dark hardwood such as ebony, with contrasting black or white pips (inlaid or painted). Alternatively, domino sets have been made from many different natural materials: stone (e.g., marble, granite or soapstone); other hardwoods (e.g., ash, oak, redwood, and cedar); metals (e.g., brass or pewter); ceramic clay, or even frosted glass or crystal. These sets have a more novel look, and the often heavier weight makes them feel more substantial; also, such materials and the resulting products are usually much more expensive than polymer materials. \n\nModern commercial domino sets are usually made of synthetic materials, such as ABS or polystyrene plastics, or Bakelite and other phenolic resins; many sets approximate the look and feel of ivory while others use colored or even translucent plastics to achieve a more contemporary look. Modern sets also commonly use a different color for the dots of each different end value (one-spots might have black pips while two-spots might be green, three red, etc.) to facilitate finding matching ends. Occasionally, one may find a domino set made of card stock like that for playing cards. Such sets are lightweight, compact, and inexpensive, and like cards are more susceptible to minor disturbances such as a sudden breeze. Sometimes, dominoes have a metal pin (called a spinner or pivot) in the middle.\n\nThe traditional set of dominoes contains one unique piece for each possible combination of two ends with zero to six spots, and is known as a double-six set because the highest-value piece has six pips on each end (the \"double six\"). The spots from one to six are generally arranged as they are on six-sided dice, but because blank ends having no spots are used, seven faces are possible, allowing 28 unique pieces in a double-six set.\n\nHowever, this is a relatively small number especially when playing with more than four people, so many domino sets are \"extended\" by introducing ends with greater numbers of spots, which increases the number of unique combinations of ends and thus of pieces. Each progressively larger set increases the maximum number of pips on an end by three, so the common extended sets are double-nine, double-12, double-15, and double-18. Larger sets such as double-21 can theoretically exist, but are rarely seen in retail stores, as identifying the number of pips on each domino becomes difficult, and a double-21 set would have 253 pieces, far more than is normally necessary for most domino games even with eight players.\n\nThe oldest confirmed written mention of dominoes in China comes from the \"Former Events in Wulin\" (i.e., the capital Hangzhou) written by the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) author Zhou Mi (1232–1298), who listed \"pupai\" (gambling plaques or dominoes), as well as dice as items sold by peddlers during the reign of Emperor Xiaozong of Song (r. 1162–1189). Andrew Lo asserts that Zhou Mi meant dominoes when referring to \"pupai\", since the Ming author Lu Rong (1436–1494) explicitly defined \"pupai\" as dominoes (in regard to a story of a suitor who won a maiden's hand by drawing out four winning \"pupai\" from a set).\n\nThe earliest known manual written about dominoes is the \"(Manual of the Xuanhe Period)\" written by Qu You (1341–1437), but some Chinese scholars believe this manual is a forgery from a later time.\n\nIn the \"Encyclopedia of a Myriad of Treasures\", Zhang Pu (1602–1641) described the game of laying out dominoes as \"pupai\", although the character for \"pu\" had changed, yet retained the same pronunciation. Traditional Chinese domino games include \"Tien Gow, Pai Gow, Che Deng\", and others. The 32-piece Chinese domino set, made to represent each possible face of two thrown dice and thus have no blank faces, differs from the 28-piece domino set found in the West during the mid 18th century. Chinese dominoes with blank faces were known during the 17th century.\n\nMany different domino sets have been used for centuries in various parts of the world to play a variety of domino games. Each domino originally represented one of the 21 results of throwing two six-sided dice (2d6). One half of each domino is set with the pips from one die and the other half contains the pips from the second die. Chinese sets also introduce duplicates of some throws and divide the dominoes into two suits: military and civil. Chinese dominoes are also longer than typical European dominoes.\n\nThe early 18th century had dominoes making their way to Europe, making their first appearance in Italy. The game changed somewhat in the translation from Chinese to the European culture. European domino sets contain neither suit distinctions nor the duplicates that went with them. Instead, European sets contain seven additional dominoes, with six of these representing the values that result from throwing a single die with the other half of the tile left blank, and the seventh domino representing the blank-blank (0–0) combination.\n\nIvory dominoes were routinely used in 19th-century rural England in the settling of disputes over traditional grazing boundaries, and were commonly referred to as \"bonesticks\".\n\nDomino tiles, also known as bones, are twice as long as they are wide and usually have a line in the middle dividing them into two squares. The value of either side is the number of spots or pips. In the most common variant (double-six), the values range from blank or no pips to six. The sum of the two values, i.e. the total number of pips, may be referred to as the rank or weight of a tile, and a tile with more pips may be called heavier than a lighter tile with fewer pips.\n\nTiles are generally named after their two values; e.g. deuce-five or five-deuce (2–5 or 5–2) are alternative ways of describing the tile with the values two and five. Tiles that have the same value on both ends are called doubles, and are typically referred to as double-zero, double-one, etc. Tiles with two different values are called singles.\n\nEvery tile belongs to the two suits of its two values, e.g. 0–3 belongs both to the blank suit (or 0 suit) and to the 3 suit. Naturally the doubles form an exception in that each double belongs to only one suit. In 42, the doubles can be treated as an additional suit of doubles, so the double-six (6–6) belongs both to the six suit and the suit of doubles.\n\nThe most common domino sets commercially available are double six (with 28 tiles) and double nine (with 55 tiles). Larger sets exist and are popular for games involving several players or for players looking for long domino games. The number of tiles in a set has the formula formula_1 for a double-\"n\" set.\n\nThe most popular type of play are layout games, which fall into two main categories, blocking games and scoring games.\n\n\nThe most basic domino variant is for two players and requires a double-six set. The 28 tiles are shuffled face down and form the \"stock\" or \"boneyard\". Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge in front of the players, so each player can see their own tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the opponent's hands at all times during gameplay.\n\nOne player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. This tile starts the line of play, in which values of adjacent pairs of tile ends must match. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends; if a player is unable to place a valid tile, they must keep on pulling tiles from the stock until they can. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\n\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says domino after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino.\n\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile, and they are not allowed to pass before the stock is (nearly) empty. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominoes\".\n\nAdaptations of both games can accommodate more than two players, who may play individually or in teams.\n\nThe line of play is the configuration of played tiles on the table. It starts with a single tile and typically grows in two opposite directions when players add matching tiles. In practice, players often play tiles at right angles when the line of play gets too close to the edge of the table.\n\nThe rules for the line of play often differ from one variant to another. In many rules, the doubles serve as spinners, i.e., they can be played on all four sides, causing the line of play to branch. Sometimes, the first tile is required to be a double, which serves as the only spinner. In some games such as Chicken Foot, all sides of a spinner must be occupied before anybody is allowed to play elsewhere. Matador has unusual rules for matching. Bendomino uses curved tiles, so one side of the line of play (or both) may be blocked for geometrical reasons.\n\nIn Mexican Train and other train games, the game starts with a spinner from which various trains branch off. Most trains are owned by a player and in most situations players are allowed to extend only their own train.\n\nIn blocking games, scoring happens at the end of the game. After a player has emptied their hand, thereby winning the game for the team, the score consists of the total pip count of the losing team's hands. In some rules, the pip count of the remaining stock is added. If a game is blocked because no player can move, the winner is often determined by adding the pips in players' hands.\n\nIn scoring games, each individual can potentially add to the score. For example, in Bergen, players score two points whenever they cause a configuration in which both open ends have the same value and three points if additionally one open end is formed by a double. In Muggins, players score by ensuring the total pip count of the open ends is a multiple of a certain number. In variants of Muggins, the line of play may branch due to spinners.\n\nIn British public houses and social clubs, a scoring version of \"5s-and-3s\" is used. The game is normally played in pairs (two against two) and is played as a series of \"ends\". In each \"end\", the objective is for players to attach a domino from their hand to one end of those already played so that the sum of the end dominoes is divisible by five or three. One point is scored for each time five or three can be divided into the sum of the two dominoes, i.e. four at one end and five at the other makes nine, which is divisible by three three times, resulting in three points. Double five at one end and five at the other makes 15, which is divisible by three five times (five points) and divisible by five three times (three points) for a total of eight points.\n\nAn \"end\" stops when one of the players is out, i.e., has played all of their dominoes. In the event no player is able to empty their hand, then the player with the lowest domino left in hand is deemed to be out and scores one point. A game consists of any number of ends with points scored in the ends accumulating towards a total. The game ends when one of the pair's total score exceeds a set number of points. A running total score is often kept on a cribbage board. 5s-and-3s is played in a number of competitive leagues in the British Isles.\n\nFor 40 years the game has been played by four people, with the winner being the first player to score 150 points, in multiples of five, by using 27 bones, using mathematical strategic defenses and explosive offense. At times, it has been played with pairs of partners. The double-six set is the preferred deck with the lowest denomination of game pieces, with 28 dominoes.\n\nIn many versions of the game, the player with the highest double leads with that double, for example \"double-six\". If no one has it, the next-highest double is called: \"double-five?\", then \"double-four?\", etc. until the highest double in any of the players' hands is played. If no player has an \"opening\" double, the next heaviest domino in the highest suit is called - \"six-five?\", \"six-four?\". In some variants, players take turns picking dominoes from the stock until an opening double is picked and played. In other variants, the hand is reshuffled and each player picks seven dominoes. After the first hand, the winner (or winning team) of the previous hand is allowed to pick first and begins by playing any domino in his or her hand.\n\nPlaying the first bone of a hand is sometimes called setting, leading, downing, or posing the first bone. Dominoes aficionados often call this procedure smacking down the bone. After each hand, bones are shuffled and each player draws the number of bones required, normally seven. Play proceeds clockwise. Players, in turn, must play a bone with an end that matches one of the open ends of the layouts.\n\nIn some versions of the games, the pips or points on the end, and the section to be played next to it must add up to a given number. For example, in a double-six set, the \"sum\" would be six, requiring a blank to be played next to a six, an ace (one) next to a five, a deuce (two) next to a four, etc.\n\nThe stock of bones left behind, if any, is called the bone yard, and the bones therein are said to be sleeping. In draw games, players take part in the bone selection, typically drawing from the bone yard when they do not have a \"match\" in their hands.\n\nIf a player inadvertently picks up and sees one or more extra dominoes, those dominoes become part of his or her hand.\n\nA player who can play a tile may be allowed to pass anyway. Passing can be signalled by tapping twice on the table or by saying \"go\" or \"pass\".\n\nPlay continues until one of the players has played all the dominoes in his or her hand, calls \"Out!\", \"I win\", or \"Domino!\" and wins the hand, or until all players are blocked and no legal plays remain. This is sometimes referred to as locked down or sewed up. In a common version of the game, the next player after the block picks up all the dominoes in the bone yard as if trying to find a (nonexistent) match. If all the players are blocked, or locked out, the player with the lowest hand (pip count) wins. In team play, the team with the lowest individual hand wins. In the case of a tie, the first of tied players or the first \"team\" in the play rotation wins.\n\nIn games where points accrue, the winning player scores a point for each pip on each bone still held by each opponent or the opposing team. If no player went out, the win is determined by the lightest hand, sometimes only the excess points held by opponents.\n\nA game is generally played to 100 points, the tally being kept on paper. In more common games, mainly urban rules, games are played to 150, 200, or 250 points.\n\nIn some games, the tally is kept by creating , where the beginning of the house (the first 10 points) is a large +, the next 10 points are O, and scoring with a five is a /, and are placed in the four corners of the house. One house is equal to 50 points.\n\nIn some versions, if a lock down occurs, the first person to call a lock-down gains the other players bones and adds the amount of the pips to his or her house. If a person who calls rocks after a call of lock-down or domino finds the number of pips a player called is incorrect, those points become his.\n\nWhen a player plays out of turn or knocks when he could have played and someone calls bogus play, the other person is awarded 50 points.\n\nApart from the usual blocking and scoring games, also domino games of a very different character are played, such as solitaire or trick-taking games. Most of these are adaptations of card games and were once popular in certain areas to circumvent religious proscriptions against playing cards.\nA very simple example is a Concentration variant played with a double-six set; two tiles are considered to match if their total pip count is 12.\n\nA popular domino game in Texas is 42. The game is similar to the card game spades. It is played with four players paired into teams. Each player draws seven dominoes, and the dominoes are played into tricks. Each trick counts as one point, and any domino with a multiple of five dots counts toward the total of the hand. These 35 points of \"five count\" and seven tricks equals 42 points, hence the name.\n\nDominoes is played at a professional level, similar to poker. Numerous organisations and clubs of amateur domino players exist around the world. Some organizations, including the \"Fédération Internationale de Domino (FIDO)\" organize international competitions. The 2008 and 2009 Double FIDO domino world champion from the UK is Darren Elhindi.\n\nBesides playing games, another use of dominoes is the domino show, which involves standing them on end in long lines so that when the first tile is toppled, it topples the second, which topples the third, etc., resulting in all of the tiles falling. By analogy, the phenomenon of small events causing similar events leading to eventual catastrophe is called the domino effect.\n\nArrangements of millions of tiles have been made that have taken many minutes, even hours to fall. For large and elaborate arrangements, special blockages (also known as firebreaks) are employed at regular distances to prevent a premature toppling from undoing more than a section of the dominoes while still being able to be removed without damage.\n\nThe phenomenon also has some theoretical relevance (amplifier, digital signal, information processing), and this amounts to the theoretical possibility of building domino computers. Dominoes are also commonly used as components in Rube Goldberg machines.\n\nThe Netherlands has hosted an annual domino-toppling exhibition called Domino Day since 1986. The event held on 18 November 2005 knocked over 4 million dominoes by a team from Weijers Domino Productions. On Domino Day 2008 (14 November 2008), the Weijers Domino Productions team attempted to set 10 records:\nThis record attempt was held in the in Leeuwarden. The artist who toppled the first stone was the Finnish acrobat Salima Peippo.\n\nAt one time, Pressman Toys manufactured a product called Domino Rally that contained tiles and mechanical devices for setting up toppling exhibits.\n\nIn Berlin on 9 November 2009, giant dominoes were toppled in a 20th-anniversary commemoration of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Former Polish president and Solidarity leader Lech Wałęsa set the toppling in motion.\n\nSince April 2008, the character encoding standard Unicode includes characters that represent the double-six domino tiles in various orientations. All combinations of blank through six pips on the left or right provides 49 glyphs, the same combinations vertically for another 49, and also a horizontal and a vertical \"back\" for a total of 100 glyphs. In this arrangement, both orientations are present: horizontally both tiles [1|6] and [6|1] exist, while a regular game set only has one such tile. The Unicode range for dominoes is U+1F030–U+1F09F. The naming pattern in Unicode is, by example, . Few fonts are known to support these glyphs. While the complete domino set has only 28 tiles, for printing layout reasons, the Unicode set needs both horizontal and vertical forms for each tile, plus the 01-03 (plain) 03-01 (reversed) pairs, and generic backsides.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "144231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144231", "title": "EarthBound", "text": "EarthBound\n\nEarthBound, also known as Mother 2 in Japan, is a 1994 Japanese role-playing video game co-developed by Ape Inc. and HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console. As Ness and his party of four, the player travels the world to collect the 8 melodies in order to defeat the evil alien force Giygas. It is the second game of the \"Mother\" series and the first and only to be released outside of Japan for two decades. \"EarthBound\" was released in Japan in August 1994, and in North America the next June.\n\nThe game had a lengthy development period that spanned five years. Its returning staff from \"Mother\" (1989) included writer/director Shigesato Itoi and lead programmer Satoru Iwata (later the president of Nintendo), as well as composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. Suzuki and Tanaka incorporated a diverse range of popular and exotic styles into the soundtrack, including salsa, reggae, and dub music, and wrote enough music as to fill two compact discs. Most of the other staff members had not worked on the original \"Mother\", and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until Iwata joined the team. Originally scheduled for release in January 1993, the game was completed around May 1994. \n\nThemed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of Americana and Western culture, \"EarthBound\" subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a real world setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre. Itoi wanted it to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone; for example, the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues, experiences in-game hallucinations, and battles piles of vomit, taxi cabs, and walking nooses. Upon release, it was marketed with a $2 million promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed \"this game stinks\". Japanese-to-English localizer Marcus Lindblom reworked the original puns and humor for the game's American release while adding private jokes and various allusions to Western pop culture. Its title, \"\"Mother 2\", was changed to \"EarthBound\"\" to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to.\n\nInitial reviewers had little praise for \"EarthBound\" in the United States, where it sold half as many copies as in Japan. Critics attribute this to a combination of the game's simple graphics, the satirical marketing campaign, and a lack of market interest in the genre. In the ensuing years, a dedicated fan community spawned which advocated for the series. Starting in 1999, Ness became a featured character in each of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series of video games which helped popularize \"EarthBound\". By the 2000s, the game had become regarded as a \"sacred cow amongst gaming's cognoscenti\", with multiple reader polls ranking it among the best of all time. A Japan-only sequel, \"Mother 3\", was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2006. In 2013, \"EarthBound\" was given a worldwide release on the Wii U Virtual Console following many years of fan lobbying, marking its debut in many territories including Europe.\n\n\"EarthBound\" features many traditional role-playing game elements: the player controls a party of characters who travel through the game's two-dimensional world composed of villages, cities, caves, and dungeons. Along the way, the player fights battles against enemies and the party receives experience points for victories. If enough experience points are acquired, a character's level will increase. This pseudo-randomly increases the character's attributes, such as offense, defense, and the maximum hit points (HP) and psychic points (PP) of each character. Rather than using an overworld map screen like most console RPGs of its era, the world is entirely seamless, with no differentiation between towns and the outside world. Another non-traditional element is the perspective used for the world. The game uses oblique projection, while most 2D RPGs use a \"top down\" view on a grid or an isometric perspective.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, \"EarthBound\" does not use random encounters. When physical contact occurs between a character and an enemy, the screen dissolves into battle mode. In combat, characters and enemies possess a certain amount of HP. Blows to an enemy reduce the amount of HP. Once an enemy's HP reach zero, that enemy is defeated. If a specific type of enemy is defeated, there is a chance that the character will receive an item after the battle. In battle, the player is allowed to choose specific actions for their characters. These actions can include attacking, healing, spying (reveals enemy weakness/strengths), mirroring (emulate a specific enemy), and running away. Characters can also use special PSI attacks that require PP. Once each character is assigned a command, the characters and enemies perform their actions in a set order, determined by character speed. Whenever a character receives damage, the HP box gradually \"rolls\" down, similar to an odometer. This allows players an opportunity to heal the character or win the battle before the counter hits zero, after which the character is knocked unconscious. If all characters are rendered unconscious, the game transitions to an endgame screen, asking if the player wants to continue. An affirmative response brings Ness, conscious, back to the last telephone he saved from, with half the money on his person at the time of his defeat, and with other party members showing as still unconscious. Because battles are not random, tactical advantages can be gained. If the player physically contacts an enemy from behind (indicated by a translucent green swirl which fills the screen), the player is given a first-strike priority. However, this also applies to enemies, who can also engage the party from behind (in this case, the swirl is red). Neutral priority is indicated by a blue swirl. Additionally, as Ness and his friends become stronger, battles with weaker enemies are eventually won automatically, forgoing the battle sequence, and weaker monsters will begin to flee from Ness and his friends rather than chase them.\n\nCurrency is indirectly received from Ness' father, who can also save the game's progress. Each time the party wins a battle, Ness' father deposits money in an account that can be withdrawn at ATMs. In towns, players can visit various stores where weapons, armor, and items can be bought. Weapons and armor can be equipped to increase character strength and defense, respectively. In addition, items can be used for a number of purposes, such as healing. Towns also contain several other useful facilities such as hospitals where players can be healed for a fee.\n\n\"EarthBound\" takes place about a decade after the events of \"Mother\", in the fictional country of Eagleland. The player starts as a young boy named Ness as he investigates a nearby meteorite crash with his neighbor, Pokey, to find his brother Picky. They find that an alien force, Giygas, has enveloped and consumed the world in hatred and consequently turned animals, humans, and objects into malicious creatures. A small, bee-like creature from the future instructs Ness to collect melodies in a Sound Stone to preemptively stop the force, but is killed shortly thereafter when Pokey and Picky's mother mistakes him for a pest. While visiting these eight Sanctuaries, Ness meets three other kids named Paula, Jeff, and Poo – \"a psychic girl, an eccentric inventor, and a ponytailed martial artist\", respectively – who join his party. Along the way, Ness visits the cultists of Happy Happy Village, where he saves Paula, and the zombie-infested Threed, where the two of them fall prey to a trap. After Paula telepathically instructs Jeff in a Winters boarding school to rescue them, they continue to Saturn Valley, a village filled with a species of creatures called Mr. Saturn, the city of Fourside, and the seaside resort Summers. Meanwhile, Poo, the prince of Dalaam, partakes in a seemingly violent meditation called \"Mu Training\" before joining the party as well.\n\nThe party continues to travel to the Scaraba desert, the Deep Darkness swamp, another village of creatures called Tenda who need a book to overcome their shyness, and a forgotten underworld where dinosaurs live. When the Sound Stone is eventually filled, Ness visits Magicant, a surreal location in his mind where he fights his personal dark side. Upon returning to Eagleland, Ness and his party use the Phase Distorter to travel back in time to fight Giygas, transferring their souls into robots. The group discovers a device that contains the alien, but it is being guarded by Pokey, who is revealed to have been helping Giygas all along. After defeating him in a fight, Pokey turns the device off, releasing Giygas and forcing the group to fight the monster. During the fight, Paula reaches out to the inhabitants of Earth, who pray for the children's safety. The prayers manage to exploit Giygas' fatal weakness – human emotions – and defeat the alien, eradicating him from all of existence. In a post-credits scene, Ness, whose life has returned to normal following Giygas' defeat, receives a note from Pokey, who challenges Ness to come and find him.\n\nThe first \"Mother\" was released for the NES in 1989. Its sequel, \"Mother 2\", or \"EarthBound\", was developed over five years by Ape (later Creatures) and HAL, and published through Nintendo. The game was written and designed by Japanese author, musician, and advertiser Shigesato Itoi, and produced by Satoru Iwata, who became Nintendo's president and CEO. \"Mother 2\" was made with a development team different from that of the original game, and most of its members were unmarried and willing to work all night on the project. \"Mother 2\" development took much longer than planned and came under repeated threat of cancellation. Itoi has said that the project's dire straits were resolved when Iwata joined the team. Ape's programming team had more members than HAL on the project. The HAL team (led by lead programmer Iwata) worked on the game programming, while the Ape team (led by lead programmer Kouji Malta) worked on specific data, such as the text and maps. They spent biweekly retreats together at the HAL office in view of Mount Fuji.\n\nThe game continues \"Mother\" story in that Giygas reappears as the antagonist (and thus did not die at the end of \"Mother\") and the player has the option of choosing whether to continue the protagonist's story by choosing whether to name their player-character the same as the original. He considered interstellar and interplanetary space travel instead of the confines of a single planet in the new game. After four months, Itoi scrapped the idea as cliché. Itoi sought to make a game that would appeal to populations that were playing games less, such as girls.\n\nThe \"Mother\" series titles are built on what Itoi considered \"reckless wildness\", where he would offer ideas that encouraged his staff to contribute new ways of portraying scenes in the video game medium. He saw the titles foremost as games and not \"big scenario scripts\". Itoi has said that he wanted the player feel emotions such as \"distraught\" when playing the game. The game's writing was intentionally \"quirky and goofy\" in character, and written in the Japanese kana script so as to give dialogue a conversational feel. Itoi thought of the default player-character names when he did not like his team's suggestions. Many of the characters were based on real life personalities. For instance, the desert miners were modeled on specific executives from a Japanese construction company. The final battle dialogue with Giygas was based on Itoi's recollections of a traumatic scene from the Shintoho film \"The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty\" that he had accidentally seen in his childhood. Itoi referred to the battle background animations as a \"video drug\". The same specialist made nearly 200 of these animations, working solely on backgrounds for two years.\n\nThe idea for the rolling HP meter began with pachinko balls that would drop balls off the screen upon being hit. This did not work as well for characters with high health. Instead, around 1990, they chose an odometer-style hit points counter. The bicycle was one of the harder elements to implement—it used controls similar to a tank before it was tweaked. Iwata felt that the Ape programmers were particularly willing to tackle such challenges. The programmers also found difficulty implementing the in-game delivery service, where the delivery person had to navigate around obstacles to reach the player. They thought it would be funny to have the delivery person run through obstacles in a hurry on his way off-screen. The unusual maps laid out with diagonal streets in oblique projection required extra attention from the artists. Itoi specifically chose against having an overworld map, and didn't want to artificially distinguish between towns and other areas. Instead, he worked to make each town unique. His own favorite town was Threed, though it was Summers before then.\n\n\"Mother 2\" was designed to fit within an eight megabit limit, but was expanded in size and scope twice: first to 12 megabits and second to 24 megabits. The game was originally scheduled for release in January 1993 on a 12 megabit cartridge. It was finished around May 1994 and the Japanese release was set for August 27, 1994. With the extra few months, the team played the game and added small, personal touches. Itoi told \"Weekly Famitsu\" that Shigeru Miyamoto liked the game and that it was the first role-playing game that Miyamoto had completed. \"Mother 2\" would release in North America about a year later.\n\n\"Mother\" composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka returned to make the \"EarthBound\" soundtrack, along with newcomers Hiroshi Kanazu and Toshiyuki Ueno. In comparison with \"Mother\", Itoi said that \"EarthBound\" had more \"jazzy\" pieces. Suzuki told \"Weekly Famitsu\" that the Super NES afforded the team more creative freedom with its eight-channel ADPCM based SPC700, as opposed to the old Nintendo Entertainment System's restriction of five channels of basic waveforms. This entailed higher sound quality and music that sounds closer to his regular compositions. Itoi believes that \"EarthBound\" may be the first video game to use vibrato, or \"string-bending\", in its music. The soundtrack was released by Sony Records on November 2, 1994.\n\nIn Suzuki's songwriting process, he would first compose on a synthesizer before working with programmers to get it in the game. His personal pieces play when the player is walking about the map, out of battle. Suzuki's favorite piece is the music that plays while the player is on a bicycle, which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include. He wrote over 100 pieces, but much of it was not included in the game. The team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of the 24 megabit cartridge—about two compact discs.\n\nAccording to Tanaka, the Beach Boys were repeatedly referenced between him and Suzuki, and that he would often listen to co-founder Brian Wilson's 1988 eponymous album while on the way to Suzuki's home. Suzuki has stated that the percussive arranging in the game's soundtrack was based on the Beach Boys' albums \"Smile\" (unreleased) and \"Smiley Smile\" (1967), which both contained American themes shared with Van Dyke Parks' \"Song Cycle\" (1968). To Suzuki, \"Smile\" evoked the bright and dark aspects of America, while \"Song Cycle\" displayed a hazy sound mixed with American humor and hints of Ray Bradbury, a style which he considered essential to the soundtrack of \"Mother\". Tanaka recalls Randy Newman being the first quintessentially American composer he could think of, and that his albums \"Little Criminals\" (1977) and \"Land of Dreams\" (1988) were influential. While Suzuki corroborated with his own affinity for Harry Nilsson's \"Nilsson Sings Newman\" (1970), he also cited John Lennon as a strong influence due to the common theme of love in his music, which was also a prominent theme in the game, and that his album \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" (1970) helped him to avoid excessive instrumentation over the SNES's technical constraints.\n\nThe soundtrack contains direct musical quotations of some classical and folk music; the composers also derived a few samples culled from other sources including commercial pop and rock music. The texture of the work was partially influenced by some salsa, reggae, and dub music. Speaking about Frank Zappa's \"Make a Jazz Noise Here\" (1991), Tanaka felt that Zappa would have been the best at creating a live performance of \"Mother\" music, but could not detail Zappa's specific influence on \"EarthBound\". Additionally, he felt that the mix tape \"Wired Magazine Presents: Music Futurists\" (1999) presented a particular selection of artists which embody the ethos of \"EarthBound\", running the gamut from Space Age composer Esquivel to avant-garde trumpeter Ben Neill, along with innovators Sun Ra, Steve Reich, Todd Rundgren, Brian Eno, and Can. Tanaka also mentioned that he listened to the various artists compilation \"\" (1988) heavily during \"EarthBound\"'s development. Miscellaneous influences on Suzuki and Tanaka for \"EarthBound\" include the music of Michael Nyman, Miklós Rózsa's film score for \"The Lost Weekend\" (1945), and albums by various other pop/rock musicians.\n\nAs was traditional for Nintendo, \"Mother 2\" was developed in Japan and localized in the United States, a process in which the game is translated into English for Western audiences. As the only game in the \"Mother\" series to be released in North America at the time, its title \"\"Mother 2\" was changed to \"EarthBound\"\" to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to.\n\nNintendo of America's Dan Owsen began the English localization project and converted about ten percent of the script before moving to another project. Marcus Lindblom filled Owsen's position around January 1995. Lindblom credits Owsen with coining some of the game's \"most iconic phrases\", such as \"say fuzzy pickles\". Lindblom himself was given liberties to make the script \"as weird as [he] wanted\", as Nintendo wanted the script to be more American than a direct translation would be. He worked alone and with great latitude due to no divisional hierarchies. Lindblom was aided by Japanese writer Masayuki Miura, who translated the Japanese script and contextualized its tone, which Lindblom positively described as \"a glass half full\".\n\nLindblom was challenged by the task of culturally translating \"an outsider's view of the U.S.\" for an American audience. He also sought to stay true to the original text, though he never met or spoke with Itoi. In addition to reworking the original puns and humor, Lindblom added private jokes and American cultural allusions to Bugs Bunny, comedian Benny Hill, and \"This Is Spinal Tap\". Apart from the dialogue, he wrote the rest of the game's text, including combat prompts and item names. As one of several Easter eggs, he named a non-player character for his daughter, Nico, who was born during development. While Lindblom took the day off for her birth, he proceeded to work 14-hour days without weekends for the next month. The game also includes protection against piracy that, when triggered, increases enemy counts to make the game less enjoyable. Additionally, right before players reach the end of the pirated copy's story, their game resets and deletes its saved file in an act that IGN declared \"arguably the most devious and notorious example of 'creative' copy protection\".\n\nUnder directives from Nintendo, Lindblom worked with the Japanese artists and programmers to remove references to intellectual property, religion, and alcohol from the American release, such as a truck's Coca-Cola logo, the red crosses on hospitals, and crosses on tombstones. Alcohol became coffee, Ness was no longer nude in the Magicant area as seen in the image, and the Happy Happyist blue cultists were made to look less like Ku Klux Klansmen. The team was not concerned with music licensing issues and considered itself somewhat protected under the guise of parody. Lindblom recalled that the music did not need many changes. The graphical fixes were not finished until March 1995, and the game was not fully playable until May.\n\n\"EarthBound\" was released on June 5, 1995 in North America. Though Nintendo spent about $2 million on marketing, the American release was ultimately viewed as unsuccessful within Nintendo. The game's atypical marketing campaign was derived from the game's unusual humor. As part of Nintendo's larger \"Play It Loud\" campaign, \"EarthBound\" \"this game stinks\" campaign included foul-smelling scratch and sniff advertisements. \"1UP.com\" called the scratch and sniff advertising campaign \"infamously ill-conceived\", and Digital Trends described the campaign as \"bizarre\" and \"based around fart jokes\". \"GamePro\" reported that they received more reader complaints about the game's scratch and sniff ad than about any other 1995 advertisement. The campaign was also expensive. It emphasized magazine advertisements and had the extra cost of the strategy guide included with each game. Aaron Linde of \"Shacknews\" wrote that the price of the packaged game curtailed sales. Between the poor sales and the phasing out of the Super NES, the game did not receive a European release.\n\nThe game originally received little critical praise from the American press, and sold poorly in the United States: around 140,000 copies, as compared to twice as many in Japan. \"Kotaku\" described \"EarthBound\" 1995 American release as \"a dud\" and blamed the low sales on \"a bizarre marketing campaign\" and graphics \"cartoonish\" beyond the average taste of players. The game was released when RPGs were not popular in the United States, and visual taste in RPGs was closer to \"Chrono Trigger\" and \"Final Fantasy VI\". The game was especially expensive due to the included strategy guide. While the game piggybacked on Itoi's celebrity in Japan, it became a \"curio\" for European audiences.\n\nOf the original reviewers, Nicholas Dean Des Barres of \"DieHard GameFan\" wrote that \"EarthBound\" was not as impressive as \"Final Fantasy III\", although just as fun. He praised the game's humor and wrote that the game completely defied his first impressions. Des Barres wrote that \"past the graphics\", which were purposefully 8-bit for nostalgia, the game is not an \"entry level\" or a \"child's\" RPG, but \"highly intelligent\" and \"captivating\". The Brazilian \"Super GamePower\" explained that those expecting a \"Dungeons and Dragons\"-style RPG will be disappointed by the childish visuals, which were unlike other 16-bit games. They wrote that the American humor was too mature and that the gameplay was too immature, as if for beginners. \"GamePro\" gave the game a mixed review, commenting that \"[T]he lack of a convincing story line and the dull NES-clone graphics ... will make serious RPG fans a little cautious about approaching \"EarthBound\"\". They said the \"saving graces are the fairly good music\" and \"hilarious adult humor\" but added that \"the humor is too mature for little kids, and the gameplay is too immature for older gamers.\"\n\nLindblom and his team were devastated by the release's poor critical response and sales. He recalled that the game was hurt by reception of its graphics as \"simplistic\" at a time when critics placed high importance on graphics quality. Lindblom felt that the game's changes to the RPG formula (e.g., the rolling HP meter and fleeing enemies) were ignored in the following years, though he thought the game had aged well at the time of its Virtual Console re-release in 2013.\nReviewing the game years after its release, multiple writers described the game as \"original\" or \"unique\" and praised its script's range of emotions and humor. IGN's Scott Thompson said the game teetered between solemn and audacious in its dialogue and gameplay, and noted its deviance from RPG tropes in aspects such as choice of attacks in battle. He found the game both \"bizarre and memorable\". \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" Simon Parkin thought the game's script was its best asset, as \"one of the medium's strongest and idiosyncratic storylines\" that fluctuated \"between humorous and poignant\". \"GameZone\" David Sanchez thought its script was \"clever\" and \"sharp\", as it displayed a wide range of emotions that made him want to talk to all non-player characters. \"GamesTM\" wrote that the game designers spoke with their players through the non-playable characters, and noted how Itoi's interests shaped the script, its allusions to popular culture, and its \"strangely existential narrative framework\".\n\nCritics praised its \"real world\" setting, which was seen as an uncommon choice. IGN's Thompson noted its 1990s homage as \"a love letter to 20th-century Americana\", with a payphone as a save point, ATMs to transfer money, yo-yos as weapons, skateboarders and hippies as enemies, and references to classic rock bands. \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" Parkin noted the theme's distance from the \"knights and dragons\" common to the Japanese role-playing game genre. Reviewers noted the game's steep difficulty. IGN's Thompson wrote that the beginning was the hardest, and that aspects such as limited inventory, experience grinds, and monetary penalties upon death were unfriendly for players new to Japanese RPGs. He also cited the quick respawn time for foes and ultimate need not to avoid battles given the difficulty of bosses.\n\nReviewers described the game's ambiance as cheery and full of charm. David Sanchez of \"GameZone\" thought the game's self-awareness added to its charm, where the player learned through the game's poking lighthearted fun. He added that the music was an \"absolute delight\" and complimented its range from space sounds to themes to \"bizarre\" battle tracks that varied with the enemy type. \"GamesTM\" wrote that the game's reputation comes from the \"consistent ... visual language\" in its Charles M. Schulz-esque character and world design. \"Kotaku\" Jason Schreier found the ending unsatisfying and unrelieving, despite finding the ending credits with its character curtain call and photo album of \"fuzzy pickles\" moments all \"wonderful\".\n\nIGN's Scott Thompson wrote that \"EarthBound\" balances \"dark Lovecraftian apocalypse and silly lightheartedness\", and was just as interesting nearly a decade after its original release. While he lamented a lack of \"visual feedback\" in battle animations, he felt the game had innovations that still feel \"smart and unique\": the rolling HP meter and lack of random battles. Thompson also noted that technical issues like animation slowdown with multiple enemies on-screen went unfixed in the rerelease. \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" Parkin found the game to provide a more potent experience than developers with more resources and thought its battle sequences were \"sleek\". \"Nintendo World Report\" Justin Baker was surprised by the \"excellent\" battle system and controls, which he found to be underreported in other reviews despite their streamlined, grind-reducing convenience. He wrote that some of the menu interactions were clunky. \"GamesTM\" felt that the game was \"far from revolutionary\", compared to \"Final Fantasy VI\" and \"Chrono Trigger\", and that its battle scenes were unexciting. The magazine compared the game's \"chosen one\" story to a \"throwaway \"\"/\"Goonies\" hybrid narrative\". Reviewers praised Nintendo for digitizing the Player's Guide, though IGN noted that it was technically easier to view it on another tablet rather than switching the Wii U's view mode. Multiple reviewers concluded that the game had aged well.\n\n\"EarthBound\" was listed in \"1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die\", where Christian Donlan wrote that the game is \"name-checked by the video gaming cognoscenti more often than it's actually been played\". He called the game \"utterly brilliant\" and praised its overworld and battle system. Similarly, \"Eurogamer\" Simon Parkin described it as a \"sacred cow amongst gaming's cognoscenti\". Critics consider \"EarthBound\" a \"classic\" or \"must-play\" video game, even in the United Kingdom, where the title was only available via import. Game journalists have ranked \"EarthBound\" among the best Super Nintendo games and most essential Japanese role-playing games, and multiple reader polls ranked the game among the best of all time. \"IGN\" rated \"EarthBound\" setting among the best in the medium, indelible between its unconventional environments, 1960s music, and portrayal of Americanism. \n\nIt has been described as one of the weirdest and most surreal role-playing games. Examples include using items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues, experiencing in-game hallucinations, meeting \"a man who turned himself into a dungeon\", and battling piles of vomit, taxi cabs, and walking nooses. David Sanchez of \"GameZone\" wrote that \"EarthBound\" \"went places no other game would\" in the 1990s or even in the present day, including \"trolling\" the player \"before trolling was cool\". Localization reviewer Clyde Mandelin described the Japanese-to-English conversion as \"top-notch for its time\". \"Kotaku\" found the localization \"funny, clever, and evocative\", and \"1UP.com\" said it was \"unusually excellent\" for the time. IGN wrote that Nintendo was \"dead wrong\" for believing that Americans would not be interested in \"such a chaotic and satirical world\".\n\n\"Kotaku\" described aspects of the game's story, such as the \"Mr. Saturn coffee break\", as \"poignant\". Jeremy Parish of \"USgamer\" called \"EarthBound\" \"the all-time champion\" of self-aware games that \"warp ... perceptions and boundaries\" and break the fourth wall, citing its frequent internal commentary about the medium and the final scenes where the player is directly addressed by the game. He thought the final scene was \"perhaps the most clever and powerful moment in a clever and powerful game\". \"GamesTM\" said the game felt fresh because of its reliance on \"personal experiences\" made it \"exactly the sort of title that would thrive today as an indie hit\". He called this accomplishment \"remarkable\" and credited Nintendo's commitment to the \"voices of creators\". IGN's Nadia Oxford said that nearly two decades since the release, its final boss fight against Giygas continues to be \"one of the most epic video game standoffs of all time\" and noted its emotional impact. \"Kotaku\" wrote that the game was content to make the player \"feel lonely\", and, overall, was special not for any individual aspect but for its method of using the video game medium to explore ideas impossible to explore in other media.\n\n\"EarthBound\" is known for having a cult following, which developed over time well after its release. Colin Campbell of \"Polygon\" wrote that \"few gaming communities are as passionate and active\" as \"EarthBound\", and \"1UP.com\" Bob Mackey wrote that no game was as poised to have a cult following. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas wrote in 2006 that \"EarthBound\" \"persistent\", \"ambitious\", and \"religiously dedicated collective of hardcore fans\" would be among the first groups to influence Nintendo's decision-making through their purchasing power on Virtual Console. Digital Trends's Anthony John Agnello wrote that \"no video game fans have suffered as much as \"EarthBound\" fans\", and cited Nintendo's reluctance to release \"Mother\" series games in North America. IGN described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America for similar reasons. Nintendo president Satoru Iwata later credited the community response on their online Miiverse social platform as leading to \"EarthBound\" eventual rerelease on their Virtual Console platform. Physical copies of \"EarthBound\" were hard to find before the rerelease, and in 2013, were worth twice its initial retail price.\n\n\"Wired\" described the amount of \"EarthBound\" \"fan art, videos, and tributes on fan sites like \"EarthBound\" Central or Starmen.net\" as mountainous. Reid Young of Starmen.net and Fangamer credits \"EarthBound\" popularity to its \"labor of love\" nature, with a \"double-coat of thoughtfulness and care\" across all aspects of the game by a development team that appeared to love their work. Young started the fansite that would become Starmen.net in 1997 while in middle school. It became \"the definitive fan community for \"EarthBound\" on the web\" and had \"almost inexplicable\" growth. \"Shacknews\" described the site's collection of fan-made media as \"absolutely massive\". It also provided a place to aggregate information on the \"Mother\" series and to coordinate fan actions.\n\nThe \"EarthBound\" fan community at Starmen.net coalesced with the intent to have Nintendo of America acknowledge the \"Mother\" series. The community drafted several thousand-person petitions for specific English-language \"Mother\" series releases, but in time, their request shifted to no demand at all, wanting only their interest to be recognized by Nintendo. A 2007 campaign for a \"Mother 3\" English localization led to the creation of a full-color, 270-page art book—\"The EarthBound Anthology\"—sent to Nintendo and press outlets as demonstration of consumer interest. \"Shacknews\" called it more of a proposal than a collection of fan art, and \"the greatest gaming love letter ever created\". Upon \"little\" response from Nintendo, they decided to localize the game themselves. Starmen.net co-founder and professional game translator Clyde \"Tomato\" Mandelin led the project from its November 2006 announcement to October 2008 finish. They then printed a \"professional quality strategy guide\" through Fangamer, a video game merchandising site that spun off from Starmen.net. \"The Verge\" cited the effort as proof of the fan base's dedication.\n\nOther fan efforts include \"EarthBound, USA\", a full-length documentary on Starmen.net and the fan community, and \"Mother 4\", a fan-produced sequel to the \"Mother\" series that went into production when Itoi definitively \"declared\" that he was done with the series. After following the fan community from afar, Lindblom came out to fans in mid-2012 and the press became interested in his work. He had planned a book about the game's development, release, and fandom before a reply from Nintendo discouraged him from pursuing the idea. He plans to continue to communicate directly with the community about the game's history.\n\n\"EarthBound\" Ness became widely known for his appearance as a playable character throughout the \"Super Smash Bros.\" fighting game series, debuting as a fighter in the first installment in 1999. Ness's inclusion in the original release was among its biggest surprises, and renewed \"Mother\" series fans' faith in new content from Nintendo. Ness was one of the game's most powerful characters, according to \"IGN\", if players could perfect his odd controls and psychic powers. In Europe, which did not see an \"EarthBound\" release, Ness was better known for his role in the fighting game than for his original role in the role-playing game.\n\nNess returned in the first sequel, \"Melee\", alongside an \"EarthBound\"-themed item and battle arena. Lucas, the protagonist of \"Mother 3,\" joined Ness in \"Brawl\". Several years after \"Brawl\" release, \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" wrote that Ness was an unpopular \"Smash\" character who should be removed from future installments. However, Ness returned in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, and Lucas was later added as downloadable content. Nintendo also produced Ness and Lucas Amiibo figurines.\n\nIn 1996, Nintendo announced a sequel to \"EarthBound\" for the Nintendo 64: \"Mother 3\" (\"EarthBound 64\" in North America). It was scheduled for release on the 64DD, a Nintendo 64 expansion peripheral that used a magneto-optical drive, but struggled to find a firm release date as its protracted development entered development hell. It was later canceled altogether in 2000 when the 64DD flopped. In April 2003, a Japanese television advertisement revealed that both \"Mother 3\" and a combined \"Mother 1+2\" cartridge were in development for the handheld Game Boy Advance. \"Mother 3\" abandoned the Nintendo 64 version's 3D, but kept its plot. It became a bestseller upon its Japanese release in 2006, yet did not receive a North American release on the basis that it would not sell. \"IGN\" described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America, as \"Mother 1\", \"Mother 1+2\" and \"Mother 3\" were not released outside Japan.\n\nWhen Nintendo launched its digital distribution platform, Virtual Console, for the Wii in 2006, \"IGN\" expected \"EarthBound\" to be among Nintendo's highest priorities for rerelease, given the \"religious\" dedication of its fanbase. Though the game was ranked the most desired Virtual Console release by \"Nintendo Power\" readers, rated for release by the ESRB, and able to be published with little effort, the Wii version did not materialize. Many fans believed that music licensing or legal concerns impeded the rerelease. English localizer Marcus Lindblom doubted that the game's music samples were an issue, since they were not a concern during development, and instead hypothesized that Nintendo did not realize the magnitude of the game's popular support and did not consider it a priority project. By 2008, it was not apparent that Nintendo of America was considering a rerelease. At the end of 2012, Itoi announced that the rerelease was moving forward, which a January 2013 Nintendo Direct presentation confirmed. \n\nAs part of anniversary celebrations for the Nintendo Entertainment System and \"Mother 2\" in March 2013, Nintendo rereleased \"EarthBound\" for Japan on the Wii's successor, the Wii U Virtual Console. \"EarthBound\" producer Satoru Iwata, now Nintendo's president, soon announced a wider rerelease, citing fan interest on Nintendo's Miiverse social platform. The July 2013 American and European launch included a free, online recreation of the game's original Player's Guide, optimized for viewing on the Wii U Gamepad. The game was a top-seller on the Wii U Virtual Console, and both \"Kotaku\" users and first-time \"EarthBound\" players had an \"overwhelmingly positive\" response to the game. Simon Parkin wrote that its rerelease was a \"momentous occasion\" as the return of \"one of Nintendo's few remaining lost classics\" after 20 years. The rerelease was one \"GameSpot\" editor's game of the year, and \"Nintendo Life\" Virtual Console game of the year. The New Nintendo 3DS-specific Virtual Console received the rerelease the next year, in March 2016. In September 2017, Nintendo released the Super NES Classic Edition, which included \"EarthBound\" among its games. Japan's version of the console did not include the game.\n\n"}
{"id": "12421555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12421555", "title": "Equivocation (magic)", "text": "Equivocation (magic)\n\nEquivocation (or the magician's choice) is a verbal technique by which a magician gives an audience member an apparently free choice, but frames the next stage of the trick in such a way that each choice has the same end result. For example, the performer may deal two cards to the table and ask a spectator to select one: if the spectator chooses the card on the left, the performer will say something like \"you keep this card, I'll take the remaining card\". If the spectator chooses the card on the right, the performer will take that card. Thus, the choice of which card to use is really made by the magician.\n\nThese basic techniques can be expanded to include practically any number of items, such as an entire deck of cards. For larger sets, items may first be grouped, then split up. The magician must quickly and carefully craft patter to convey the impression that the actions he or she takes with the items truly reflect the intent of the spectator.\n\nEquivocation can be used to force a card without the use of sleight of hand. The use of this kind of verbal force in close-up magic apparently offers a subject a free or random choice of card. It is not as common as sleight of hand or other methods.\n\nIn another use, a mentalist may perform an apparent act of mind reading by using the \"magician's choice\" to force a particular envelope that relates to a needed outcome. A mentalist may also force an effect from a certain outcome, as in taking something ordinary and using it to show their magical prowess.\n\nIn each of these examples, the effectiveness of the equivocation involves the \"information gap\" between what the spectator knows and what the spectator thinks they know. In the magician's force, the spectator does not know anything about what will happen to the two cards he initially selects. However, the spectator thinks that they are making a free choice in an otherwise scripted sequence of moves. In the effect of the prepared envelope, the spectator thinks they know that the envelope involves a prediction, but does not realize that the envelope in fact involves three predictions.\n\nEquivocation tends to lose its effectiveness if repeated in the same context, since the spectator gains more information from one performance to the next, thereby shrinking the information gap. For example, a spectator may wonder why their choice was kept in some cases and discarded in others. Equivocation is a particular form of alternate ending forces where double entendre wording is used and a different pattern of results to questions can be noticed, but its real strength is best realized when augmented with artful psychological techniques.\n\n"}
{"id": "83932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83932", "title": "Fictional universe", "text": "Fictional universe\n\nA fictional universe is a self-consistent setting with events, and often other elements, that differ from the real world. It may also be called an imagined, constructed or fictional realm (or world). Fictional universes may appear in novels, comics, films, television shows, video games, and other creative works.\n\nA fictional universe can be almost indistinguishable from the real world, except for the presence of the invented characters and events that characterize a work of fiction; at the other extreme, it can bear little or no resemblance to the real world, with invented fundamental principles of time and space.\n\nThe subject is most commonly addressed in reference to fictional universes that differ markedly from the real world, such as those that introduce entire fictional cities, countries, or even planets, or those that contradict commonly known facts about the world and its history, or those that feature fantasy or science fiction concepts such as magic or faster than light travel—and especially those in which the deliberate development of the setting is a substantial focus of the work.\n\nWhat distinguishes a fictional universe from a simple setting is the level of detail and internal consistency. A fictional universe has an established continuity and internal logic that must be adhered to throughout the work and even across separate works. So, for instance, many books may be set in conflicting fictional versions of Victorian London, but all the stories of Sherlock Holmes are set in \"the same\" Victorian London. However, the various film series based on Sherlock Holmes follow their own separate continuities, thus not taking place in the same fictional universe.\n\nThe history and geography of a fictional universe are well defined, and maps and timelines are often included in works set within them. Even new languages may be constructed. When subsequent works are written within the same universe, care is usually taken to ensure that established facts of the canon are not violated. Even if the fictional universe involves concepts such as elements of magic that don't exist in the real world, these must adhere to a set of rules established by the author.\n\nA famous example of a detailed fictional universe is Arda (more popularly known as Middle-earth), of J. R. R. Tolkien's books \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Silmarillion\". He created first its languages and then the world itself, which he states was \"primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary 'history' for the Elvish tongues.\"\n\nA modern example of a fictional universe is that of the \"Avatar\" film series, as James Cameron has invented an entire ecosystem, with a team of scientists to test whether it was viable. Additionally, he commissioned a linguistics expert to invent the \"Na'vi\" language.\n\nVirtually every successful fictional TV series or comic book develops its own \"universe\" to keep track of the various episodes or issues. Writers for that series must follow the \"story bible\", which often becomes the series canon.\n\nFrequently, when a series is perceived by its creators as too complicated or too self-inconsistent (because of, for example, too many writers), the producers or publishers may introduce retroactive continuity (retcon) to make future editions easier to write and more consistent. This creates an alternate universe that future authors can write about. These stories about the universe or universes that existed before the retcon are usually not canonical, unless the franchise-holder gives permission. \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" was an especially sweeping example.\n\nSome writers choose to introduce elements or characters from one work into another, to present the idea that both works are set in the same universe. For example, the character of Ursula Buffay from American sitcom \"Mad About You\" was also a recurring guest star in \"Friends\", despite the two series having little else in common. Fellow NBC series \"Seinfeld\" also contained crossover references to \"Mad About You\". L. Frank Baum introduced the characters of Cap'n Bill and Trot (from \"The Sea Fairies\") into the Oz series in \"The Scarecrow of Oz\", and they made a number of appearances in later Oz books. In science fiction, A. Bertram Chandler introduced into his future Galactic civilization the character Dominic Flandry from Poul Anderson's quite different Galactic future (he had Anderson's consent) – on the assumption that these were two alternate history timelines and that people could on some occasions cross from one to the other.\n\nSir Thomas More's \"Utopia\" is one of the earliest examples of a cohesive fictional world with its own rules and functional concepts, but it comprises only one small island. Later fictional universes, like Robert E. Howard's \"Conan the Cimmerian\" stories or Lev Grossman's Fillory, are global in scope and some, like \"Star Wars\", \"Honorverse\", \"BattleTech\", or the Lensman series, are galactic or even intergalactic.\n\nA fictional universe may even concern itself with more than one interconnected universe through fictional devices such as dreams, \"time travel\" or \"parallel worlds\". Such a series of interconnected universes is often called a multiverse. Such multiverses have been featured prominently in science fiction since at least the mid-20th century.\n\nThe classic \"\" episode \"\" introduced the Mirror Universe, in which the crew members of the Starship \"Enterprise\" were brutal rather than compassionate. The 2009 movie \"Star Trek\" created an \"alternate reality\" and freed the \"Star Trek\" franchise from continuity issues. In the mid-1980s, DC Comics \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" streamlined its fictional continuity by destroying most of its alternate universes.\n\nA fictional universe can be contained in a single work, as in George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" or Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\", or in serialized, series-based, open-ended or round robin-style fiction.\n\nIn most small-scale fictional universes, general properties and timeline events fit into a consistently organized continuity. However, in the case of universes that are rewritten or revised by different writers, editors, or producers, this continuity may be violated, by accident or by design.\n\nThe occasional publishing use of retroactive continuity (retcon) often occurs due to this kind of revision or oversight. Members of fandom often create a kind of fan-made canon (fanon) to patch up such errors; \"fanon\" that becomes generally accepted sometimes becomes actual canon. Other fan-made additions to a universe (fan fiction, alternate universe, pastiche, parody) are usually not considered canonical unless they get authorized.\n\nShared universes often come about when a fictional universe achieves great commercial success and attracts other media. For example, a successful movie may catch the attention of various book authors, who wish to write stories based on that movie. Under U.S. law, the copyright-holder retains control of all other derivative works, including those written by other authors, but they might not feel comfortable in those other mediums or may feel that other individuals will do a better job; therefore, they may open up the copyright on a shared-universe basis. The degree to which the copyright-holder or franchise retains control is often one of the points in the license agreement.\n\nFor example, the comic book \"Superman\" was so popular that it spawned over 30 different radio, television, and movie series and a similar number of video games, as well as theme park rides, books, and songs. In the other direction, both \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\" are responsible for hundreds of books and games of varying levels of canonicity.\n\nFictional universes are sometimes shared by multiple prose authors, with each author's works in that universe being granted approximately equal canonical status. For example, Larry Niven's fictional universe Known Space has an approximately 135-year period in which Niven allows other authors to write stories about the Man-Kzin Wars. Other fictional universes, like the \"Ring of Fire\" series, actively court canonical stimulus from fans, but gate and control the changes through a formalized process and the final say of the editor and universe creator.\n\nOther universes are created by one or several authors but are intended to be used non-canonically by others, such as the fictional settings for games, particularly role-playing games and video games. Settings for the role-playing game \"Dungeons & Dragons\" are called campaign settings; other games have also incorporated this term on occasion. Virtual worlds are fictional worlds in which online computer games, notably MMORPGs and MUDs, take place. A fictional crossover occurs when two or more fictional characters, series or universes cross over with one another, usually in the context of a character created by one author or owned by one company meeting a character created or owned by another. In the case where two fictional universes covering entire \"actual\" universes cross over, physical travel from one universe to another may actually occur in the course of the story. Such crossovers are usually, but not always, considered non-canonical by their creators or by those in charge of the properties involved.\n\nFor lists of fictional universes see:\n\n\n"}

It runs deeper than our activities involving music and art. It is the essence of our being, something we were born with then strive to recapture.\n\nThis book reflects the experience of an improvisational violinist as a doorway into understanding the acts of creation in which every human being engages in his or her daily life. Improvisation and creativity are not the property of a few professional artists or scientists but the essence of all our natural, spontaneous interactions. Every conversation is unrehearsed and reflects the activity of improvising as a basic life function.\n\nFrom the opening of the first chapter: \"There is an old Sanskrit word, Lila (Leela), which means play. Richer than our word, it means divine play, the play of creation and destruction and re-creation, the folding and unfolding of the cosmos. Lila, free and deep, is both delight and enjoyment of this moment, and the play of God. It also means love.\nLila may be the simplest thing there is---spontaneous, childish, disarming. But as we grow and experience the complexities of life, it may also be the most difficult and hard won achievement imaginable, and it's coming to fruition is a kind of homecoming to our true selves.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "13911199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13911199", "title": "Friction motor", "text": "Friction motor\n\nA friction motor is a simple mechanism to propel toy cars, trucks, trains, action figures and similar toys. The motor consists of a large flywheel which is connected to the drive wheels of the toy via a very low gear ratio, so that the flywheel revolves faster. The flywheel's axis is perpendicular to the direction in which the toy faces and moves. When the toy is pushed forward, the drive wheels engage the flywheel. Pushing the vehicle forward repeatedly spins this flywheel up to speed. When let go, the flywheel drives the vehicle forward. The flywheel stores the kinetic energy of the initial acceleration and propels the toy after it is released. \n\nAs the flywheel, unlike the spring of a pullback motor, is continuously rotating and not held, the motor may be \"pumped up\" by pushing the car repeatedly forward. The cars also typically work in forward and reverse. Some used a \"zip cord\" pulled from the vehicle body to accelerate the flywheel directly. Another system was the \"Turbo Tower of Power\" (TTP) in which air expelled from a hand-operated pump pushed turbine blades on the flywheel's rim.\n\nThese toys were especially popular in the 1960s to 1980s though they continue to be available today.\n"}
{"id": "2024225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2024225", "title": "Hip-hop dance", "text": "Hip-hop dance\n\nHip-hop dance refers to street dance styles primarily performed to hip-hop music or that have evolved as part of hip-hop culture. It includes a wide range of styles primarily breaking which was created in the 1970s and made popular by dance crews in the United States. The television show \"Soul Train\" and the 1980s films \"Breakin'\", \"Beat Street\", and \"Wild Style\" showcased these crews and dance styles in their early stages; therefore, giving hip-hop mainstream exposure. The dance industry responded with a commercial, studio-based version of hip-hop—sometimes called \"new style\"—and a hip-hop influenced style of jazz dance called \"jazz-funk\". Classically trained dancers developed these studio styles in order to choreograph from the hip-hop dances that were performed on the street. Because of this development, hip-hop dance is practiced in both dance studios and outdoor spaces.\n\nThe commercialization of hip-hop dance continued into the 1990s and 2000s with the production of several television shows and movies such as \"The Grind\", \"Planet B-Boy\", \"Rize\", \"StreetDance 3D\", \"America's Best Dance Crew\", \"Saigon Electric\", the \"Step Up\" film series, and \"The LXD\", a web series. Though the dance is established in entertainment, including mild representation in theater, it maintains a strong presence in urban neighborhoods which has led to the creation of street dance derivatives Memphis jookin, turfing, jerkin', and krump.\n\n1980s films, television shows, and the Internet have contributed to introducing hip-hop dance outside the United States. Since being exposed, educational opportunities and dance competitions have helped maintain its presence worldwide. Europe hosts several international hip-hop competitions such as the UK B-Boy Championships, Juste Debout, and EuroBattle. Australia hosts a team-based competition called World Supremacy Battlegrounds and Japan hosts a two-on-two competition called World Dance Colosseum.\n\nWhat distinguishes hip-hop from other forms of dance is that it is often \"freestyle\" (improvisational) in nature and hip-hop dance crews often engage in freestyle dance competitions—colloquially referred to as \"battles\". Crews, freestyling, and battles are identifiers of this style. Hip-hop dance can be a form of entertainment or a hobby. It can also be a way to stay active in competitive dance and a way to make a living by dancing professionally.\n\nHip-hop dance is a broad category that includes a variety of styles. It originated at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue by DJ Kool Herc and his historic block party that started it all. The older dance styles that were created in the 1970s include uprock, breaking, and the funk styles. Breaking was created in The Bronx, New York, incorporating dances that were popular in the 1960s and early 1970s in African-American communities. In its earliest form, it began as elaborations on James Brown's \"Good Foot\" dance which came out in 1972. Breaking at this period was not primarily floor-oriented as seen today; it started out as toprock which dancers perform while standing up. An influence on toprock was uprock which was created in Brooklyn, New York. Uprock looks similar to toprock, but it is more aggressive and looks like a fight. Uprock is also performed with partners, but in toprock—and in breaking in general—each person takes turns dancing. In 1973, DJ Kool Herc invented the break beat. A break beat is a rhythmic, musical interlude of a song that has been looped over and over again to extend that instrumental solo. Kool Herc did this to provide a means for dancers who attended his parties to demonstrate their skills. B-boy and b-girl stands for \"break-boy\" and \"break-girl\"; b-boys and b-girls dance to the break of a record. Further influenced by martial arts and gymnastics, breaking went from being a purely upright dance style—toprock only—to becoming more floor-oriented.\n\nAt the same time breaking was developing in New York, other styles were being created in California. The \"funk styles\" refers to several street dance styles created in California in the 1970s such as roboting, bopping, hitting, locking, bustin', popping, electric boogaloo, strutting, sac-ing, and dime-stopping. Out of all of these dances, boogaloo is one of the oldest. It started out as a 1960s fad dance and was the subject of several songs released during that time such as \"Do the Boogaloo\" and \"My Baby Likes to Boogaloo\". From being a fad, it developed into a dance style called electric boogaloo and a music genre called Latin boogaloo. The most popular and widely practiced of the funk styles are locking and popping. The television show \"Soul Train\" played a large role in giving these styles commercial exposure. Both The Lockers and The Electric Boogaloos—dance crews responsible for the spread of locking and popping—performed on this show.\n\nIt is historically inaccurate to say that the funk styles were always considered hip-hop. In an interview with \"Racked\" Moncell Durden, assistant dance professor at the University of Southern California, is quoted as saying \"Hip-hop dance involves two dances: breaking and social dances. That's it. Nothing else is hip-hop.\" The funk styles were adopted into hip-hop in large part due to the media. The media identified these styles as \"breakdance\" which caused confusion about their origin. They were created on the west coast independent from breaking and were originally danced to funk music, rather than hip-hop music.\n\nAs breaking, locking, and popping gained popularity in the 1980's, hip-hop social dancing (party dancing) started to develop. Novelty and fad dances such as the Roger Rabbit, the Cabbage Patch, and the Worm appeared in the 1980s followed by the Humpty dance and the Running Man in the 1990s. The music of the day was the driving force in the development of these dances. For example, the 1980s rap group Gucci Crew II had a song called \"The Cabbage Patch\" that the dance of the same name was based on. 2000s era social dances include the Cha Cha Slide, the Cat Daddy, and the Dougie. The previously mentioned dances are a sample of the many that have appeared since hip-hop developed into a distinct dance style. Like hip-hop music, hip-hop social dancing continues to change as new songs are released and new dances are created to accompany them.\n\nBreaking was created in the South Bronx, New York City during the early 1970s. It is the first hip-hop dance style. At the time of its creation, it was the only hip-hop dance style because Afrika Bambaataa classified it as one of the five pillars of hip-hop culture along with MCing (rapping), DJing (turntablism), graffiti writing (bombing), and knowledge. Though African Americans created breaking, Puerto Ricans maintained its growth and development when it was considered a fad in the late 1970s. In a 2001 interview Richard \"Crazy Legs\" Colón, the president of Rock Steady Crew, commented on how Puerto Ricans contributed to breaking: \"I think the difference is when the brothas first started doing [it] and it was at its infancy they weren't doing acrobatic moves. That didn't come into play until more Puerto Ricans got involved in the mid 70s. We then took the dance, evolved it and kept it alive. In '79 I was getting dissed. I would go into a dance and I would get dissed by a lot of brothas who would ask 'Why y'all still doing that dance? That's played out'. By 79, there were very few African American brothas that was doing this... We always maintained the flava. It was like a changing of the guard and all we did was add more flava to something that already existed.\" Breaking includes four foundational dances: toprock, footwork-oriented steps performed while standing up; downrock, footwork performed with both hands and feet on the floor; freezes, stylish poses done on your hands; and power moves, complex and impressive acrobatic moves. Transitions from toprock to downrock are called \"drops.\"\n\nTraditionally, breakers dance within a \"cypher\" or an \"Apache Line\". A cypher is a circular shaped dance space formed by spectators that breakers use to perform or battle in. Cyphers work well for one-on-one b-boy or b-girl (break-boy/break-girl) battles; however, Apache Lines are more appropriate when the battle is between two crews—teams of street dancers. In contrast to the circular shape of a cypher, competing crews can face each other in this line formation, challenge each other, and execute their \"burns\" (a move intended to humiliate the opponent, i.e. crotch grabbing).\n\nLocking, originally called Campbellocking, was created in 1969 in Los Angeles, California by Don \"Campbellock\" Campbell and popularized by his crew The Lockers. In addition to Campbell, the original members of The Lockers were Fred \"Mr. Penguin\" Berry, Leo \"Fluky Luke\" Williamson, Adolfo \"Shabba-Doo\" Quiñones, Bill \"Slim the Robot\" Williams, Greg \"Campbellock Jr\" Pope, and Toni Basil, who also served as the group's manager. At the 2009 World Hip Hop Dance Championships, Basil became the first female recipient of the Living Legend Award in honor of her role in giving locking commercial exposure.\n\nLocking looks similar to popping, and the two are frequently confused by the casual observer. In locking, dancers hold their positions longer. The \"lock\" is the primary move used in locking. It is \"similar to a freeze or a sudden pause.\" A locker's dancing is characterized by frequently \"locking\" in place and after a brief freeze moving again. According to \"Dance Spirit\" magazine, a dancer cannot perform both locking and popping simultaneously; thus, it is incorrect to call locking \"pop-locking\". While both styles originate in Los Angeles, locking and popping are two distinct funk styles with their own histories, their own set of dance moves, their own pioneers, and their own competition categories. Locking is more playful and character-driven, whereas popping is more illusory. In popping, dancers push the boundaries of what they can do with their bodies. Locking has specific dance moves that distinguish it from popping and other funk styles. In the 2006 book \"Total Chaos\", hip-hop historian Jorge \"Popmaster Fabel\" Pabon lists some of these moves which include \"the lock, points, skeeter [rabbits], scooby doos, stop 'n go, which-away, and the fancies.\" In addition, Lockers commonly use a distinctive dress style, such as colorful clothing with stripes and suspenders.\n\nPopping was created in Fresno, California in the 1970s and popularized by Samuel \"Boogaloo Sam\" Solomon and his crew the Electric Boogaloos. It is based on the technique of quickly contracting and relaxing muscles to cause a jerk in a dancer's body, referred to as a \"pop\" or a \"hit\". When performed correctly, each \"hit\" is synchronized to the rhythm and beats of the music. Popping is also used as an umbrella term to refer to a wide range of closely related illusionary dance styles such as strobing, liquid, animation, twisto-flex, and waving. Dancers often integrate these styles with standard popping to create a more varied performance. In all of these subgenres it appears to the spectator that the body is popping. The difference between each subgenre is how exaggerated the popping is. In liquid, the body movements look like water. The popping is so smooth that the movements do not look like popping at all; they look fluid. The opposite of this is strobing (also called ticking) in which the movements are staccato and jerky.\n\nPopping as an umbrella term also includes gliding. Gliding is a lower body dance performed with little to no movements in the chest or arms. In gliding a dancer appears as if they are drifting across the floor on ice. Opposite from gliding is tutting, an upper body dance that uses the arms, hands, and wrists to form right angles and create geometric box-like shapes. Tutting can be done primarily with the fingers rather than the arms. This method is called finger tutting. In both variations the movements are intricate, linear, and form 90° or 45° angles. In practice, tutting looks like the characters on the art of ancient Egypt, hence the name—a reference to King Tut.\n\nWhile popping as an umbrella term is widely used by hip-hop dancers and in competitive hip-hop dancing, Timothy \"Popin' Pete\" Solomon of the Electric Boogaloos disagrees with the use of the word \"popping\" in this way. Many of these related styles (animation, liquid, tutting, etc.) can not be traced to one person or group. Solomon states \"There are people who wave and there are people who tut. They're not popping. I say this to give the people who created other styles their just dues and their props.\"\n\nDecades after breaking, locking, and popping became established, four new dance styles appeared. Three of them come from California and one comes from Tennessee. Memphis Jookin' was created in the 1980s in Memphis, Tennessee. It is an evolution of an older Memphis line dance called The Gangsta' Walk. According to \"Dance\" magazine, jookin is characterized by dancers \"gliding footwork... popping and waving... [and] using the tips of their sneakers to balance on pointe.\" Gliding on tiptoes is fundamental to this dance. While watching a jookin' battle in Jackson, Tennessee, dance critic Alastair Macaulay observed that \"the most evidently sensational feature of jookin is the extensive use of what a ballet observer is bound to call pointwork: the men, in sneakers, go onto tiptoe... many of the men not only rose onto point but also hopped, turned, ran and balanced on point.\" Jookers have traditionally practiced their moves at the Crystal Palace skating rink in Memphis, which is akin to how milongueros practice their moves in public spaces in Buenos Aires.\n\nTurfing, an acronym for Taking Up Room on the Floor, was created in 2002 by Jeriel Bey in Oakland, California. Turfing is a fusion of miming and gliding that places heavy emphasis on storytelling (through movement) and illusion. Other than San Francisco Bay Area pride, turfing avoided becoming a fad due to local turf dance competitions and local youth programs that promote turfing as a form of physical activity.\n\nThe dance style Jerkin' was popularized in 2009 by the New Boyz's rap song \"You're a Jerk\". This song went viral via their MySpace page before they had a manager or were signed to a record label. After hearing about the song, Los Angeles radio station Power 106 hired the New Boyz to perform at local high schools. These shows led to \"You're a Jerk\" entering the radio's playlist. Later the same year, rap duo Audio Push released the song and video \"Teach Me How to Jerk\" which showcased the different dance moves within jerkin' including the \"Reject\"—the Running Man done in reverse. Dancers who perform jerkin' typically wear bright colors, skinny jeans, Mohawks, and Vans sneakers. This trend echos locking dancers in the 1970s who traditionally wore suspenders and black and white striped socks. Of the dance, journalist Jeff Weiss from \"LA Weekly\" stated \"For a youth culture weaned on the cult of individualism, jerkin' is its apotheosis.\" Similar to breaking, locking, and popping, jerkin's popularity spread through dance crews. For example, The Rej3ctz (crew) created both the Cat Daddy and the Reject dance moves.\n\nAlthough jookin', turfing, and jerkin' generated regional support and media attention, none have reached the same zenith as krumping. Ceasare \"Tight Eyez\" Willis and Jo'Artis \"Big Mijo\" Ratti created krumping in the early 2000s in South Central, Los Angeles. It was only practiced in Los Angeles until it gained mainstream exposure after being featured in several music videos and showcased in the krumping documentary \"Rize\". \"Rize\" was screened at several film festivals before it was commercially released in the summer of 2005. Clowning, the less aggressive predecessor to krumping, was created in 1992 by Thomas \"Tommy the Clown\" Johnson. Johnson and his dancers would paint their faces and perform clowning for children at birthday parties or for the general public at other functions as a form of entertainment. In contrast, krumping focuses on highly energetic battles and movements which Johnson describes as intense, fast-paced, and sharp. Of the dance, journalist Taisha Paggett from \"Dance\" magazine stated \"If movement were words, [krumping] would be a poetry slam.\" Compared to breaking and the funk styles, jookin', turfing, jerkin', and krumping are relatively new. The music driving the dances and the cultural similarities between these street dance styles, the funk styles, and breaking have brought them together under the same subculture of hip-hop.\n\nThe dance industry responded to hip-hop dance by creating a commercial version of it known as urban choreography. This urban choreography, sometimes called \"new style\", is the kind of hip-hop dance seen in rap, R&B, and pop music videos and concerts. From the point of view of someone deeply immersed in hip-hop culture, anything that looks like hip-hop dance that did not come from the streets and is not improvisational in nature is not a true hip-hop dance form. In an interview with \"Dance\" magazine, choreographer and hip-hop dance teacher Emilio \"Buddha Stretch\" Austin, Jr. described his point-of-view:\n\nStage performance can suppress improvisation which defined hip-hop dance early in its development. Furthermore, meshing different dance styles together dissolves their structures and identities. In an interview with \"The Bronx Journal\", choreographer and artistic director Safi Thomas expressed a similar qualm as Austin concerning hip-hop instruction within the studio:\n\nThe term \"new style\" was created by dancers outside the United States. According to Moncell Durden, adjunct professor at Drexel University and director of the film \"History and Concept of Hip-Hop Dance\", the 1992 dance documentary \"Wreckin' Shop From Brooklyn\" was very influential to hip-hop dancers in France and Japan. These dancers wanted to move like the New York hip-hop dancers who were profiled in the documentary. They called the social dancing (party dancing) they saw \"new style\" which was short for \"New York Style\".\n\nIn the context of the commercial dance industry, urban choreography (or new style hip-hop for dancers in France and Japan) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it. From a technical aspect, it is characterized as hard-hitting involving flexibility and isolations—moving a specific body part independently from others. \n\nA second important event in the development of hip-hop was the start of hip-hop dance instruction. Buddha Stretch was a pioneer in this field. He started teaching formal hip-hop dance classes in 1989 at Broadway Dance Center in New York City where he continues to teach today. Around the same time, hip-hop party dancing started to appear in music videos and on television—this was another important point in the development and commercialization of hip-hop. An early example of this is when Janet Jackson performed the Running Man in her 1989 music video for the song \"Rhythm Nation\" which was choreographed by street dancer Anthony Thomas. The dance was so popular during this time it was also performed by 1990s rappers MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice in their choreographed routines. Michael Jackson also used hip-hop in his 1992 music video \"Remember The Time\" which was choreographed by a then 21-year-old Fatima Robinson. At the time, Robinson was a street dancer with no formal training and \"Remember the Time\" was her first music video job. According to MTV.com, \"Dances have always been a part of hip-hop culture — from the running man to the Soulja Boy dance...\" and this era was the start of commercial hip-hop choreography as it looks today: dance routines are not specific to one genre (strictly popping, strictly locking, or strictly breaking) but rather an amalgamation of urban party dancing with studio technique added to it.\n\nAnother style the dance industry created in response to hip-hop was \"jazz-funk\". This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called \"In Living Color\". The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed every show with a hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid of hip-hop and jazz dance. R&B singer Beyoncé uses this style. Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this style. They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA as well as for K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a style of hip-hop because the foundational movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (on the balls of the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.\n\nOther developments in the dance industry occurred in response to the growing popularity of hip-hop. On the traveling convention circuit there were tap, ballet, and jazz dance conventions, but there were none specifically for hip-hop. The same void existed in dancewear. There was dancewear for tap, ballet, and jazz dancers but none for hip-hop dancers. Monsters of Hip Hop and Nappytabs dancewear were formed to answer to both needs. Nappytabs is the first line of hip-hop dancewear. Because their clothing is made for hip-hop dancers, they do not sell leotards, unitards, tights, or leg warmers. Their line consists of tank tops, shorts, t-shirts, sweat pants, harem pants, and hoodies. Monsters of Hip Hop (MOHH) was founded in 2003 in Baltimore, Maryland by Andy Funk, Becky Funk, and Angie Servant. The convention is dedicated exclusively to hip-hop instruction. Fatima Robinson, Stefan \"Mr. Wiggles\" Clemente, and Timothy \"Popin' Pete\" Solomon have taught classes at MOHH in the past. Every year, the convention brings together its top student dancers for a professionally choreographed showcase in Los Angeles called \"Monsters of Hip Hop: The Show\".\n\nMOHH may have been the first hip-hop dance convention, but it is not the only one that exists. Urban Dance Camp (UDC) is a six-week-long German-based dance convention held every year in Lörrach, a small town on the border of France and Switzerland. In a report on the event by a local paper, Bettina Kraft, the manager of UDC, estimated that 85% of the participants were from outside Germany. In 2009 Kraft created Urban Dance Showcase, a parallel event to UDC reserved only for performances by professional choreographers, dance crews, and UDC teachers. Dancers such as Shaun Evaristo, Les Twins, I.aM.mE, b-boy Lilou, and b-boy Hong 10 have performed at the showcase in the past.\n\nAside from dancewear and conventions, developments in agency representation occurred as well. Although limited, representation for individual dancers had existed since the 1980s at the beginning of the music video era due to the pioneering work of talent agent Julie McDonald. However, the UK-based dance agencies ProDance and Superbad Talent were created to exclusively represent street dancers.\n\nThe entertainment industry has been largely responsible for introducing hip-hop dance to mainstream audiences around the world. The first hip-hop films \"Wild Style\", \"Beat Street\", and \"Breakin'\" were made in the 1980s. When \"Wild Style\" opened in Japan, Rock Steady Crew performed breaking in Tokyo's Harajuku shopping district to promote the film. \"Wild Style\" was the first movie centered around hip-hop culture; however, \"Flashdance\" was the first commercially released film to feature breaking. In 1984, \"Beat Street\" was released in West Germany and screened at the Cannes Film Festival which helped to introduce breaking, graffiti writing, and turntablism to this part of Europe. \"Breakin\"' and \"\" brought the funk styles to the cinema. Breaking, locking, popping, and waacking were performed in these films. At this time in the 1980s, the United States was not the only country producing hip-hop films. In 1985, Yuen Woo-ping directed a hip-hop themed romantic comedy in Hong Kong called \"Mismatched Couples\" starring Donnie Yen. Another hip-hop film, \"Electro Rock\", was released the same year in the United Kingdom. This film featured a then 14-year-old Hanifa \"Bubbles\" McQueen Hudson, the UK's first b-girl.\n\nSeveral hip-hop dance films were produced after the millennium. \"The Freshest Kids: A History of the B-Boy\", \"Neukölln Unlimited\", \"B-Girl\", \"Bouncing Cats\", \"Planet B-Boy\", and \"\" all showcase breaking. Films such as \"Honey\", \"Save the Last Dance\", \"You Got Served\", the \"Step Up\" film series, \"StreetDance 3D\", \"Hype Nation\", \"Saigon Electric\", \"Berlin Dance Battle 3D\", and \"\" showcase all forms of hip-hop dance, especially new style hip-hop. \"Rize\", \"The Heart of Krump\", and \"Shake City 101\" are documentaries about krumping. All of these movies and documentaries are examples of films where the plot and theme surround hip-hop dance and how it affects the characters' lives. \"Bouncing Cats\" is the story of b-boy Abraham \"Abramz\" Tekya who uses b-boying to empower youth in Uganda. In 2010, the film won \"Outstanding Achievement in Documentary Filmmaking\" at Newport Beach Film Festival and \"Best Documentary Feature\" at Urbanworld Film Festival. \"Saigon Electric\" was Vietnam's first hip-hop film. It was written, produced, and directed by Vietnamese-American filmmaker Stephane Gauger. The film is about two female dancers (a ribbon dancer and a hip-hop dancer) and how their respective romances, the threat of their community center being torn down, and the stress of an upcoming dance battle affects their friendship. The film was choreographed by Viet Max and Ricky Cole. In 2012, it won a Golden Kite Prize (the Vietnamese equivalent of The Oscars/BAFTAs) for \"Best Film\" and \"Best Actress\".\n\nBefore reaching movie audiences, hip-hop dance was already being broadcast on television. \"Soul Train\" was a syndicated, music variety show that featured social dancing and performances by African-American soul, funk, and R&B singers. The show was broadcast in South Korea via the US Armed Forces Korea Network. Before officially becoming a crew, The Lockers made several appearances on this show. After becoming a crew, The Electric Boogaloos also appeared on the show. \"Soul Train\" premiered in 1970. During its 36 year run, the resident freestyle dancers were referred to as the Soul Train Gang. Auditions were held in 1971 when the show moved from Chicago, Illinois to Los Angeles, California. Dancers who wanted to get on \"Soul Train\" after this time had to rely on word-of-mouth recommendations from dancers who were already employed by the show. A regular feature during the broadcast was the Soul Train Line. To participate in the Soul Train Line, the dancers formed two lines of equal length facing each other with a large space in between them. Each dancer in line would take their turn dancing down the middle.\n\nOther music variety shows on television at this time were \"American Bandstand\", \"Solid Gold\", and \"Top of the Pops\". Unlike \"Soul Train\" which focused on soul and funk, these shows promoted Top 40 music and pop acts. \"Solid Gold\" employed a permanent dance troupe called the Solid Gold Dancers who performed choreographed routines to musical performances. Lucinda Dickey, an actress and dancer who played the lead role in the \"Breakin' \" films, appeared on the show during the 1982–1983 season as a Solid Gold dancer. In 1983, street dancers Marc \"Mr. Freeze\" Lemberger from Rock Steady Crew, Timothy \"Popin' Pete\" Solomon and Dane \"Robot Dane\" Parker from the Electric Boogaloos, and locking dancers Alpha \"Omega\" Anderson and Lewis \"Deputy\" Green also appeared on Solid Gold during a performance to the song \"What a Feeling\" from the movie \"Flashdance\". In 1982 during a performance in London on \"Top of the Pops\", street dancer Jeffrey Daniel performed popping and the \"backslide\" during the song \"A Night to Remember\". This was the first time popping was shown on British television thus spreading its popularity in the United Kingdom. A year later, Michael Jackson also performed the backslide during a performance of \"Billie Jean\" on the TV special. He called it the moonwalk and his performance spread its popularity all over the world to much larger extent than Daniel's performance did. It was Jeffrey Daniel who taught Michael Jackson how to do the backslide/moonwalk.\nA few hip-hop dance shows appeared on television in the 1990s such as 1991's \"The Party Machine with Nia Peeples\" and 1992's \"The Grind\". Several hip-hop dance shows premiered in the 2000s including (but not limited to) \"Dance Fever\", \"Dance 360\", \"The Wade Robson Project\", \"MTV Dance Crew\", \"America's Best Dance Crew\", \"Dance on Sunset\", and \"Shake It Up\". In 2006, MTV France documented the creation of a dance crew for an original series called \"MTV Dance Crew\". Viewers were able to see the crew from auditions to the selection of the final eight who were subsequently named Original Soul. Original Soul was coached by three professional choreographers who mentored them and helped refine their dancing. Over the course of 32 episodes they routinely participated in professional dance battles including the popping battle at Juste Debout, the Seven 2 Smoke battle at The Notorious IBE, and b-boy battles at Chelles Battle Pro. B-boy Lilou, b-boy crew Phase T, and promoter Bruce Ykanji (the founder of Juste Debout) all made appearances during the show.\n\nThe founders of Hip Hop International, Howard and Karen Schwartz, created the reality hip-hop dance competition \"America's Best Dance Crew\" (ABDC) in 2008. On the show, different crews competed in dance challenges against each other every week. ABDC contributed to the exposure of several crews such as Jabbawockeez, Quest, Beat Freaks, and Poreotics. These crews now have official websites, work with musical artists, and perform at live events. The JabbaWockeeZ had a show in Las Vegas, Nevada called \"MÜS.I.C.\" at the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino. \"MÜS.I.C.\" was the first hip-hop dance stage show on the Las Vegas Strip. In 2012, the Jabbawockeez performed the show during a five-month residency at the Jupiters Hotel and Casino in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. Both Poreotics and Hokuto \"Hok\" Konishi from Quest were nominated for a 2011 MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography. Poreotics was nominated with singer Bruno Mars for his video \"The Lazy Song\". Hok was nominated for LMFAO's video \"Party Rock Anthem\"; the rest of Quest crew appeared in the video as featured dancers.\n\nIn contrast to ABDC, individual dancers from all backgrounds compete on the reality dance competition \"So You Think You Can Dance\" (SYTYCD). It has a similar premise to the \"Idol\" series of singing competitions with initial auditions leading to the selection of a winner over the course of several episodes. In 2008, poppers Robert \"Mr. Fantastic\" Muraine and Phillip \"Pacman\" Chbeeb auditioned during season four of the US series. Neither made it to the final \"Top 20\", but the judges were so impressed with their dancing that both were invited back to participate in a popping battle against each other on the show's live finale. According to Muraine, this was the first popping battle that was nationally televised. After the battle, hip-hop dancer Joshua Allen was declared the winner of season four of the competition. The same year Mona-Jeanette Berntsen, a hip-hop dancer from Norway, won the first season of \"So You Think You Can Dance Scandinavia\".\n\nHip-hop dance has also been popular among viewers of the \"Got Talent\" series. French hip-hop dancer Salah won the first season of \"Incroyable Talent\" in 2006. French b-boy Junior won the second season in 2007. In 2008, hip-hop dancer George Sampson won \"Britain's Got Talent\", Danish popping and roboting duo Robot Boys won \"Talent 2008\" (), and hip-hop dance crew Quick won the Norwegian version of the show. After George Sampson, dance crew Diversity won the next season of \"Britain's Got Talent\" in 2009. The same year, Brazilian crew D-Efeitos won \"Qual é o Seu Talento?\" (\"What's Your Talent?\"). In 2010, Justice Crew won \"Australia's Got Talent\". After signing a recording contract with Sony Music Australia, Justice Crew shot a video for their single \"Dance with Me\" featuring rapper Flo Rida and \"America's Best Dance Crew\" alumni Beat Freaks. In 2015, nine years after he won \"Incroyable Talent\", hip-hop dancer Salah won the fourth season of \"Arabs Got Talent\".\n\nThough hip-hop dancing is established on film and on television, it has not gained the same level of exposure in theater. This may be due to the fact that the dance is performed more in film and in television than it is in a theatrical setting. B-boy and popper Stefan \"Mr. Wiggles\" Clemente and hip-hop historian Jorge \"Popmaster Fabel\" Pabon were involved in hip-hop theater at its inception. Their dance company, GhettOriginal, produced the first hip-hop stage shows: 1991's off Broadway musical \"So! What Happens Now?\" and 1995's \"Jam on the Groove\". Both shows were performed by the Rock Steady Crew, Magnificent Force, and the Rhythm Technicians. Aside from the pioneers in New York City was Rennie Harris' Puremovement hip-hop theater company. Harris founded Puremovement in 1992 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One of Puremovement's theater shows \"Rome & Jewels\" won two Black Theater Alliance Awards and three Bessie Awards. In 2012, Harris and his company toured Egypt, Israel, and the Palestinian territories as part of Dance Motion USA, a program sponsored by the US State Department to showcase American dance to other countries and promote cultural exchange.\n\nGerman b-boy pioneer Niels \"Storm\" Robitzky has his performance roots in hip-hop theater. In 1991, Robitzky—who went by the name \"Swipe\"—left Germany with his crew Battle Squad for New York City to look for b-boy legends they could study under. When he got to New York, he met b-boy Gabriel \"Kwikstep\" Dionisio who personally mentored him and introduced him to New York techniques. While in New York, he also learned about the funk styles from Clemente. Clemente and Dionisio knew each other since Dionisio was an original member of both GhettOriginal and the Rhythm Technicians. A year later in 1992, Robitzky performed with GhettOriginal at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. and at the Lincoln Center in New York City. It was Dionisio who gave Robitzky a new name, \"Storm\". In 2000, he wrote a book called \"Von Swipe zu Storm: Breakdance in Deutschland\" (\"From Swipe to Storm: Breakdance in Germany\").\n\nDancers in the United Kingdom have had success in hip-hop theater. In 2006, hip-hop dance company Boy Blue Entertainment won a Laurence Olivier Award for their show \"Pied Piper\". In 2008, \"Into the Hoods\" became the first hip-hop theater show to perform in London's West End. It eventually went on to become the West End's longest running dance show ever.\n\nYAK Films is a three-man team that films urban dance around the world. It was founded in Oakland, California by Yoram Savion and Kash Grimes. Their first videos were of the Turf Feinz dance crew performing turfing—a regional hip-hop dance style from Oakland. After generating significant views on YouTube, they started YAK (Yoram And Kash) Films and added music producer Ben \"B'zwax\" Tarquin to the team. From shooting videos only in the United States, they were able to easily transition to covering dance events in Europe due to Savion's dual French citizenship. In 2009, they filmed Battle of the Year's first one-on-one b-boy competition, and in 2010 they filmed dance battles at Juste Debout, a French street dance competition. In addition to filming dance events and original freestyle performances, they post tutorials and upload a weekly web series called \"YAK Like You Know\". Some of their more popular videos have been featured in \"Oakland Local\" and the \"Huffington Post\".\n\nJuba Films was founded in Germany by Julien Bam and Gong Bao. Rather than film freestyle content, Juba (\"Ju\"lien and \"Ba\"o) produces short films with a storyline. For their short b-boy film \"More Than Bread\", they won first place at the 7th International Online Dance Festival in 2011. In 2012, the \"Daily Mail\" wrote an article about Juba's short film \"With a Piece of Chalk\" after the video went viral and started trending on Mashable. Both Juba Films and YAK Films appeared at The Notorious IBE's New Dance Media Conference discussing the relationship between street dance and visual arts. Although Juba Films has won an award and YAK Films has booked high-profile events, they are not the only film production teams distributing hip-hop dance videos on the Internet. House of Crews, Strife TV, Pacific Rim Video Press, ProDance TV, Battle Fest Extreme, Urban Dance Show, Ocke Films, World of Dance Network, and Canal Street TV also produce hundreds of high-quality hip-hop dance content.\n\n\"The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers\" (\"The LXD\") was a good-versus-evil themed web series about a group of dancers who discover they have super powers through their dance moves. Each character specializes in one dance style. Consequently, a wide range of styles are displayed including krumping, tutting, breaking, locking, boogaloo, and popping. The majority of the dancing shown in the series is hip-hop; however, other styles have also been performed including jazz, tap, and ballet. AdvertisingAge.com gave the series a favorable review stating \"...each episode of 'LXD' packs a wealth of narrative sophistication into its eight or nine minutes. Combine this with the theater-worthy production values and a cast that exerts itself to an ungodly extent, and the end result is – pun time! – extraordinary.\" \"The LXD\" premiered July 7, 2010 on Hulu. In 2012, Jon Chu, the writer, director, and producer of \"The LXD\" launched a dance channel on YouTube called DS2DIO (pronounced D-Studio). DS2DIO has videos of master classes, freestyle dance, and original choreographed performances. Through this channel, Chu also made \"The LXD\" available on YouTube. Before then, it could only be viewed on Hulu.\n\n\n\nIn 2004, Safi Thomas founded the Hip-Hop Dance Conservatory (HHDC) in New York City. Thomas' goal was to provide a comprehensive education to hip-hop dancers that was comparable to what ballet, modern, and jazz dancers experience at their respective institutions. HHDC provides a formal curriculum with dance classes (breaking, freestyle, locking, etc.) and academic classes (dance theory, physiology, kinesiology, etc.) to people who want to pursue hip-hop dance as a career. It is the only educational institution in the United States that is exclusively dedicated to hip-hop dance instruction. HHDC does not grant degrees. It is a non-profit organization and repertory company that grants certifications to dancers that complete the three-year program.\n\nThree years later in 2007, the University of East London's Center for Performing Arts Development (CPAD) started intake for the only bachelor's degree program in the world specializing in hip-hop, urban, and global dance forms. The CPAD's program also lasts three years, but it is not exclusive to hip-hop. Students also study African dance, kathak, Bollywood, and capoeira.\n\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n \n\n"}
{"id": "3237421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3237421", "title": "IZ (toy)", "text": "IZ (toy)\n\nThe Zizzle iZ is an electronic musical toy released in September 2005 from Zizzle. Taking the shape of an abstract tripod figure, the iZ allows users to interactively manipulate music by twisting particular parts of the figure's body as well as add sound effects to prerecorded sound from a connected audio device. The toy also acts as a dancing speaker.\n\nSince its release it has been available in three color schemes, green/orange, dark blue/light blue and red/yellow.\n\niZ was developed by Roger Shiffman, who also created the Giga Pets, Furby and Poo-Chi toys. It was explicitly said during the development phase that a \"new Furby\" was the aim. iZ is designed to seem like it has a life of its own and does things out of its user's control when there is interaction with it.\n\nSince the iZ is such an abstract kind of toy the easiest way to understand it is by learning what you can do with it.\n\nThe iZ has a few methods for input. First, as mentioned, it has an audio jack to connect other audio devices. It has two ears that are twistable and a touch-sensitive tentacle, called a flicker, on its head. On top of this it also has five buttons placed on different places on its colorful belly. All the input methods except the audio jack are colored in a secondary color to raise its affordance. The iZ's three legs are also adjustable, but these do not generate any input.\n\nFor output the iZ has a built in speaker, a nose that lights up in different colors and two eyes driven by small motors making them able to move up and down.\n\nWhen another audio device is connected to the iZ it acts as a speaker but also overlays some of its own sound effects on top of the sound from the audio device. When overlaying its own sound effects it also moves its eyes and lights up its nose. By pressing the left side of iZ belly the sound effects will be turned off and iZ will only act as a regular speaker.\n\nWhen no other audio device is connected iZ has three modes of operation; Play, DJ and WZIZ FM.\n\nIn Play mode, which is the startup mode, iZ lets you compose your own music by manipulating his inputs. Each ear corresponds to one audio track, the belly controls the drum track and tempo, and the flicker can be hit for iZ to generate sound effects. iZ randomly adds his own flavour to the track by overlaying witty comments or radio noise.\n\nWhen in DJ mode iZ evolves the track himself by changing one feature of the track at a time. If the user doesn't like the current music iZ outputs, the belly can be pressed to force iZ to instantly make a change. No interaction is allowed in this mode, so when the user tries any input which will change the track a simple sound is played to indicate that it registered the input but won't react to it.\n\nAs stated in iZ's manual \"Although he is not a radio, he thinks he is\". In WZIZ FM mode, iZ creates a completely new track every time it makes a change and inserts a noise to simulate the tuning of radio stations between the tracks. If you adjust the ears, which are supposed to be the antenna, you make iZ create a new random track instantly.\n\nZizzle and DIC Entertainment created a direct-to-video iZ cartoon, \"iZ and the Zizzles\" in 2007. The trailer could be viewed on the Zizzle website.\n\n"}

{"id": "1414581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1414581", "title": "Irrational Games", "text": "Irrational Games\n\nIrrational Games, LLC (known as 2K Boston, LLC between 2007 and 2009) was an American video game developer founded in 1997 by three former employees of Looking Glass Studios: Ken Levine, Jonathan Chey, and Robert Fermier. The studio was acquired by Take-Two Interactive in 2006. The studio was known for its games \"System Shock 2\", \"Freedom Force\", \"SWAT 4\", and most notably two of the games in the \"BioShock\" series. In 2014, following the release of \"BioShock Infinite\", Levine opted to significantly restructure the studio from around 90 to 15 employees and focus more on narrative games. In February 2017, the studio announced that it had been rebranded as Ghost Story Games and considered a fresh start from the original Irrational name, though still operating at the same business subsidiary under Take-Two.\n\n\nShortly after \"BioShock\" was released, rumors arose that many of the staff who had worked on the game were leaving 2K Boston/Australia. In 2007, five members of the 2K Boston team moved to a new 2K Games studio in Novato, California. Soon after, 2K Games announced the formation of 2K Marin in Novato.\n\nIn late July 2010, several media outlets reported that a recently created website, whatisicarus.com, was a promotion relating to Irrational Games' unannounced project. The following week, information about the game was again teased, with the trailer confirmed for release on August 12, 2010. This was eventually revealed to be \"BioShock Infinite\".\n\nBefore Irrational started development on \"BioShock Infinite\", the studio did preliminary work for the \"XCOM\" project that later became \"\".\n\nOn February 18, 2014, Levine announced that the vast majority of the Irrational Games studio staff would be laid off, with all but fifteen members of the staff losing their positions. Levine said that he wanted to start a \"a smaller, more entrepreneurial endeavor at Take-Two\", speaking to how much stress completing a large game like \"BioShock: Infinite\" had caused him. Levine said \"I need to refocus my energy on a smaller team with a flatter structure and a more direct relationship with gamers. In many ways, it will be a return to how we started: a small team making games for the core gaming audience.\" Levine had considered starting a new development studio for this, knowing that building the ideas would take several years before any game product would be made, but Take-Two offered to let him keep the division within Take-Two, with Levine saying that they told him \"there was no better place to pursue this new chapter than within their walls\". The studio helped to find positions for the displaced employees, and 2K Games hosted a career day for the remaining 75 employees to help seek employment at 57 other studios.\n\nLevine and the 15 remaining members of the team began the process of creating new, smaller games focusing on a replayable narrative for the core gamers. It was said that Levine's studio will continue to keep the Irrational name, although Take-Two later stated that it was not true. Through 2014 to 2015 Irrational Games continued to post several openings for jobs at the studio. In January 2015, Levine and the remaining staff are currently developing their first game which will be a \"first-person sci-fi\" game.\n\nOn February 23, 2017, the studio announced it had rebranded itself as Ghost Story Games, founded by 12 of the former Irrational members with Levine still as president and creative director. The studio's focus is \"to create immersive, story-driven games for people who love games that ask something of them\"; the name was chosen as ghost stories \"are immersive, exciting, and steeped in community\", similar to their design philosophies. As of this point, the studio had about 25 employees.\n\n\n"}

A two-man anthology by cartoonists Dean Haspiel and Josh Neufeld, \"Keyhole\" was published by two different publishers, starting with Millennium Publications and ending up at Top Shelf Productions.\n\n\"Keyhole\" began as a self-published mini-comic by the long-time friends Haspiel and Neufeld. \"Keyhole Mini-Comics\" ran for four issues in 1995. Reviewed in \"Factsheet Five\", \"Comics Buyer's Guide\", and elsewhere, it was then picked up by Millennium, which published the first full-sized issue in June 1996. With its fourth issue, \"Keyhole\" was released under Millennium's new imprint, Modern Comics. Top Shelf picked up the comic for its fifth and sixth issues.\n\nIn 2002, Haspiel, Neufeld, and Alternative Comics announced plans to publish \"Keyhole\" vol. II, but the comic never appeared, and the two cartoonists have since moved on to other projects.\n\nEqually inspired by Harvey Pekar's \"American Splendor\" and Los Bros Hernandez' \"Love and Rockets\", a typical issue of \"Keyhole\" featured an autobiographical travel story by Neufeld, a Billy Dogma story by Haspiel, and short recurring features such as R. Walker and Neufeld's \"Titans of Finance,\" Neufeld's one-page \"Travel Tips,\" and the Haspiel/Neufeld collaborative feature \"Lionel's Lament.\" Other stories appearing in \"Keyhole\" included short autobiographical pieces by Haspiel, and assorted collaborations with other writers (including one memorable piece with \"The Duplex Planet\"'s David Greenberger).\n\nAlthough \"Keyhole\" only ran six issues, it was a critically acclaimed project which proved to be a launching pad for both Haspiel and Neufeld's careers. \"The Comics Journal\" characterized \"Keyhole\" this way: \"Brought together in a single, independent magazine, these artists' strong, disparate talents create a broad reading experience, and a blending of artistic intentions and personal expression like very few others available today in American comix.\"\n\nHaspiel debuted his existential antihero, Billy Dogma, in \"Keyhole\", a character whose adventures have since been published by Modern Comics, Top Shelf, Alternative Comics, and Image Comics. In addition, Haspiel collected many of the autobiographical stories from \"Keyhole\" in \"Opposable Thumbs\" (2001), published by Alternative Comics, and used those stories as a jumping-off point for the \"Street Code\" stories he later told on DC Comics' webcomics imprint Zuda Comics.\n\nNeufeld, in turn, collected the \"Titans of Finance\" stories in a self-titled comic published by Alternative in 2001. In 2004, he collected his \"Keyhole\" travel stories (as well as subsequent ones) in the Xeric Award-winning graphic novel \"A Few Perfect Hours\".\n\nIn addition, both cartoonists became regular illustrators for Harvey Pekar and his \"American Splendor\" projects.\n\n\n"}

The tour began on January 5, 2018, at the Target Center in Minneapolis, and visited cities across North America, South America, Oceania and Europe.\n\nDel Rey's fifth studio album, \"Lust for Life\" was officially released worldwide on July 21, 2017. During the months leading up to the album's release, fans and press speculated whether or not Del Rey would embark on a headlining concert tour in support of the album, as she did not for her previous release, \"Honeymoon\". In an interview for Beats 1 on July 12, 2017, Zane Lowe asked Del Rey if she planned to go on a world tour and she seemed unsure, but during the following months Del Rey began to announce various one-off promotional concerts across the United Kingdom and United States. The promotional tour took place from July to October 2017, and consisted of concerts at intimate venues in London, cities in California and New York City, as well as shows at the Echo Arena Liverpool and the SSE Hydro in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn August 19, 2017, Del Rey confirmed in a video via Instagram that she would be embarking on an official world tour in support of \"Lust for Life\", as her first official headlining concert tour since The Endless Summer Tour in 2015, which was in support of \"Ultraviolence\". Del Rey teased many details of the tour during the following weeks, she informed fans of what continents she would be visiting and how to purchase tickets through presale.\n\nThe first dates for the LA to the Moon Tour were eventually announced on September 27, 2017, with a leg of North American dates, and on the same day Del Rey announced that she would be appearing at various South American festivals. Tickets for the North American shows became available for presale on September 29, followed by general sale on October 2. The North American leg is supported by American singer Jhené Aiko and Colombian-American singer Kali Uchis. Australian and European dates for the tour were announced on October 16, 2017.\n\nOn January 16, 2018, it was announced that American singer Børns, whom Del Rey had recently collaborated with on two tracks for his second studio album \"Blue Madonna\", would be joining Del Rey as the opening act for the Australian leg of the tour.\n\nIn an interview with MTV during October 2017, Del Rey stated that she was working to create a stage design for the tour that incorporates \"lots of senses\", and beach themed projections with \"beautiful structures that move in and out of the stage to give it a classic feeling\". The stage design, designed by Jason Ardizzone-West, was revealed once the tour began on January 5, 2018. The stage features an array of beach-themed props and is backed by a large screen displaying visuals designed by Storme Whitby-Grubb. Terence Cawley of \"The Boston Globe\" described the set-up as a \"microcosm of [Del Rey's] beloved California\" with a display of rock formations, palm trees, and beach chairs. Reed Fischer of \"GoMN\" similarly described the stage as \"pure Los Angeles\", suiting the title of the tour, \"LA to the Moon\", with \"projections of crashing waves, a fast-moving highway, and a sun-drenched swimming pool danced on the stage floor throughout the night\".\n\nThis set list is representative of the show on January 5, 2018 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The sketches feature host Jimmy Fallon, house band The Roots, announcer/sidekick Steve Higgins, the show's writers, celebrity guests, and audience members. Most of the skits below appeared only on \"Late Night\", while some have carried over to the \"Tonight Show\".\n\nEvery Tuesday on the show, Jimmy weighs the pros and cons of a topic that's currently in the news, with the pros being the setups and the cons being the punchlines. (e.g. Pro: With Tiger competing, this year's Masters promises to be the most exciting golf tournament ever. Con: That being said, it's still golf.) Special editions of the sketch include: \"The reissue of the Rolling Stones' album \"Exile on Main St.\"\", in which Jimmy was joined via satellite by Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Charlie Watts; one in which the topic was \"The New NFL Season\", where Jimmy was joined by Justin Tuck of the New York Giants; and \"The NFL Playoffs\" with New York Jets placekicker Nick Folk.\n\nEvery Thursday (formerly Wednesday) on the show, Jimmy reads off viewer comments from a topic for discussion he started the night before on Twitter. Topics have included \"My parents are weird\", \"Why don't they make that?\", \"Beach fail\", and \"Makes Me Mad\"\n\nJimmy previously created a spin-off named \"Late Night Instagrams\".\n\nNearly every Friday on the show, Jimmy writes thank-you notes. He claims that Friday is the day he catches up on \"personal stuff\" like checking his inbox, returning e-mails, and writing his weekly thank-you notes. He explains that he is running behind and asks the audience if they wouldn't mind if he took time out of the show to write them, and asks James Poyser to play some accompanying music (a sped-up version of U2's \"October\"). The notes are sarcastic in tone and involve current events, people in the news, or things that annoy Jimmy (e.g. \"Thank you, pony tails, for turning the backs of girls' heads into horses' butts\").\n\nThe sketch airs on Thursday during the week of Thanksgiving, in deference to the holiday. The sketch aired on Thursday, March 28, 2013, because the show was off for Good Friday that year. It also aired on Thursday, February 5, 2015, during the \"Tonight Show\"'s week in Los Angeles (the show did not air on Friday that week).\n\nJimmy also wrote out a special Winter Olympics-themed set of thank you notes during NBC's prime-time Olympic coverage on February 26, 2010 (a Friday); anchor Bob Costas \"played\" the usual thank you note-writing music (by pretending to play along on a keyboard while a pre-recorded track of the music played in the background). Costas and Jimmy reprised the bit with a Summer Olympics-themed set on August 10, 2012 (also a Friday).\n\nMayor Michael Bloomberg joined Jimmy behind the desk to write out some thank-you notes of his own on Friday, December 13, 2013.\n\nRegis Philbin joined Jimmy with a little help to write out some thank-you notes of his own on Friday, June 19, 2015.\n\nNASA astronaut Scott Kelly wrote the first thank-you note in space, during his year-long mission to the International Space Station.\n\nPresident Barack Obama joined Jimmy in writing out some thank-you notes on Thursday, June 9, 2016.\n\nIt was announced on January 31, 2011 that Fallon had signed a book deal to publish entries from the series as two books, the first of which, \"Thank You Notes\", was released May 23, 2011. The sequel, \"Thank You Notes 2\", was released on May 22, 2012. The new book also has a limited edition which has a sound chip that plays the \"Thank-you Notes\" theme music (to which Jimmy replies \"We don't even need James Poyser any more\", then the camera cuts to Poyser looking depressed).\n\nAlso on Fridays, Jimmy shows a mashup of news anchors reading the week's biggest headlines, set to music.\n\nDone on Wednesdays mostly during the NFL season. Similar to a high school yearbook, Jimmy shows pictures of NFL players and says what \"Most likely to…\" awards they received, to promote the players on the teams of that week's episode of \"NBC Sunday Night Football\", which are simply based on what they look like. He also does it for random celebrities (including the cast of the new season of \"The Bachelorette\"), as well as NHL and NBA players, whose playoffs also air on NBC. For the final version of the skit on \"Late Night\", NFL players listed the awards for the show's writers. They then doused Jimmy with Gatorade. Jimmy then gave away Super Bowl tickets to a lucky audience member.\n\nSort of an updated version of Jay Leno's \"Headlines\", Fallon shows viewer-submitted screen shots from various media (phones, Internet, television, etc.) that contain typos or similar accidentally funny errors, using an iPad (Apple Inc. is one of the show's main sponsors). The final selection is always a picture of a man who the viewer claims looks like Jimmy, who will then put on a costume to match.\n\nCiting Donald Trump's distrust of mainstream news, Jimmy appears as the President on \"Trump News Network\" in which he unsuccessfully spins negative stories about him to portray him in a more positive light, instead having the reverse effect.\n\nIn the first two seasons was a parody of the MTV series \"The Hills\", documenting Jimmy's arrival to \"Late Night\" and his initial struggles in the beginning of the show, such as whether to wear a red tie or a blue tie on his premiere episode. Season 1 of the series dealt with Jimmy's passive-aggressive power struggle with A.D. Miles, \"Late Night\"'s head writer. Future \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member Jenny Slate appeared as Jimmy's assistant who betrayed his trust by collaborating with Miles. New installments premiered every Monday during the summer of 2009, and have a storyline focused on continuity, much as \"The Hills\" does.\n\nSeason two finds Miles, having moved to the costume department in the season one finale, unhappy with his new role and wishing he was back among the writing staff. As revenge, he dresses Jimmy in ridiculous clothes in order to make Jimmy look like an idiot. During the season, Jimmy and Miles both run for the position of fire warden of the floor. In the series finale, Jimmy and Miles decide to end their silly feud and be friends again, Jimmy gives Miles his job in the writing department back, and they appointed fire-safety enthusiast Questlove to be fire warden.\n\n\n\n\"Real Housewives of Late Night\" is a recurring parody of the various \"The Real Housewives of...\" reality shows with five cast members playing the roles of their fictional \"wives\". The cast includes \"Late Night\" host Jimmy Fallon as power-mad Denise, announcer Steve Higgins as gravel-voiced chain smoker Lydia, Roots bassist Owen Biddle as alcoholic Renee, head writer A.D. Miles as uptight Dale (who is usually accompanied by her son Caleb, who is allergic to all food other than a special paste), and 'director' (in reality, writer) Bashir Salahuddin as compulsive eater Yvonne. Each segment continues from the last in an overarching story similar to \"7th Floor West\". The plot revolves around alliances and over-the-top rivalries between the characters resulting in exaggerated responses by the characters. \"Today Show's Fourth Hour\" hosts Kathy Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb appeared on the set of their show during one episode.\n\nWhen the show was in Indianapolis for Super Bowl XLVI, the housewives met up with some of the \"wives\" of the Indianapolis Colts players (actually the players themselves in drag), including Dallas Clark's wife Sherry, Pierre Garçon's wife Noelle, Antoine Bethea's wife Daris, Robert Mathis's wife Shay-Shay, and Dan Orlovsky's wife Marianne. During the episode, Denise inadvertently started a fight with the Colts wives when she mistakenly congratulated the Colts on making the Super Bowl (thinking the game was played at one of the teams' home stadium), and was informed they were actually the league's worst team that season, with their 2-14 record. This caused Denise and Yvonne to quickly resolve their differences and unite against the Colts wives, causing the \"Late Night\" wives to win the brawl.\n\n\n\nNamed after \"Late Night\"'s location at 30 Rock, Studio 6B, \"6-Bee\" is a parody of the FOX series \"Glee\". After Jimmy goes to an NBC accountant (played by Fred Armisen) to request money for cue cards, he is turned down because the $375 they would cost is too expensive. However, Jimmy discovers that the first place prize money for glee club sectionals (a flyer for which is conveniently posted in the hallway outside Studio 6B across from a row of lockers) is $380, so he decides to gather the \"Late Night\" crew – including A. D. Miles, Paula Pell, Bashir Salahuddin, and Abby Elliott from \"SNL\" – together to compete. As practice, they sing the Bon Jovi song \"Livin' on a Prayer\".\n\nLater, Jimmy and the \"Late Night\" squad discover that the cast of the NBC show \"Parks and Recreation\" (including Amy Poehler, Rashida Jones, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza, and Chris Pratt) will also be competing in sectionals – and \"Parks & Rec\" has recruited The Roots to be in their squad. Jimmy is so frustrated by the Roots' defection that he sings the Twisted Sister song \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" (which, eventually, both squads join in on).\n\nEpisode two of \"6-Bee\" won an Emmy in the category \"Outstanding Short Form Picture Editing\" at the 2010 Primetime Creative Arts Emmys.\n\n\n\"Late\" is a parody of the ABC series \"Lost\". It deals with the twelve survivors of an elevator crash on the day of the very first show of \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\". After the crash, the twelve are trapped on a mysterious abandoned floor in the 30 Rock building.\n\nOn November 8, 2010 was a musical parody of several vampire shows and movies (the \"Twilight\" films, \"The Vampire Diaries\", \"True Blood\", \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"Angel\", etc.). In the first episode, a new writer at \"Late Night\", Angelique (Kate Simses), discovers that several of the show's writers, including Jimmy, Bashir Salahuddin, and Morgan Murphy, are secretly vampires, and is herself \"turned\" by Miles.\n\n\"Jersey Floor\" is parody of the MTV series \"Jersey Shore\". It takes place on a floor in the 30 Rock building that, in addition to being a regular office floor, has a social scene filled with hot tubs, tanning, gyms and lots of partying. The floor is accessed by a special elevator that \"Jersey-fies\" its riders when the \"Jersey Floor\" button is pressed. It features Jimmy \"J-Bro\" Fallon, Steve \"The Inflation\" Higgins, Josh \"DJ Josh\" Meyers, Abby \"Lovebug\" Elliott, A.D. \"Miles\" Miles, Bashir \"B-Hole\" Salahuddin, and Rachel \"Drootchie\" Dratch. Episode 2 featured guest stars Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Episode 3 featured cameos from many members of the \"Jersey Shore\" cast, including Snooki, JWoww, Sammi Sweetheart, Deena Nicole, Ronnie, and Vinny, who were de-Jerseyfied (appearing in more conservative clothes and hairstyles) when they went back to the regular floor with their analogues, then decided they didn't like it and went back to the Jersey Floor.\n\n\n\"Downton Sixbey\" is a parody of the ITV/PBS series \"Downton Abbey\". When the Earl of Downton Sixbey (Jimmy) receives word that the current heir to Downton Sixbey, Carson Daly is missing following a hot-air ballooning accident, a distant nephew (Questlove) receives word that he is to become the new heir. However, in the second episode, Daly appears at Downton Sixbey, alive and well (only to seemingly perish before the third episode, in another hot-air ballooning accident, along with Usher and Shakira).\n\n\nOn October 9, 2012, Jimmy, as Mitt Romney, did a parody of \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\" called \"Mister Romney's Neighborhood\". Barack Obama (Dion Flynn) also appeared as the mailman (a parody of Mr. McFeely). Later, he visited the Neighborhood of Make-Believe (\"where me and Paul Ryan get most of our facts from\") and outed Henrietta Pussycat as a puppet operated by a union worker. This sketch was in response to the real Romney's claim that he will discontinue federal PBS funding if he is elected president.\n\nIn a parody of \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\" in 2013, Jimmy puts on a cardigan and hosts a children's program, but everything is a little off.\n\n\"Game of Desks\" is a parody of \"Game of Thrones\". The premiere, on May 24, 2013, had A. D. Miles overthrowing Jimmy and appointing himself host, and sentencing Jimmy to death by beheading. When the executioner failed by missing the chopping block entirely and Jimmy lived, Seth Meyers was appointed Jimmy's successor (as he already has been in real life).\n\nOn September 11, 2013, \"Joking Bad\" was a parody of the AMC series \"Breaking Bad\". When the Jimmy learns that he has only six months left as host of \"Late Night\", he teams up with low-level street joke dealer Higgins to sell top quality jokes on the black market. However, after head writer Miles becomes suspicious after seeing video of Colin Quinn with one of the illicit jokes, Jimmy turns to black-market joke wholesaler Gus (Dion Flynn) to move his supply.\n\nBob Odenkirk appeared in a cameo in character as Saul Goodman, while Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul appeared in cameos ostensibly as themselves.\nOn September 22, 2015 was a parody of \"Empire\", \"Jimpire\" sees Jimmy trying to decide who should be his successor as host of the show if he were to die from his finger injury. Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson appeared as their characters on the real show: Howard calmly told Jimmy to stop imitating Lucious Lyon, while Henson got in a fist fight with her analog Steve Higgins (saying she's the one and only Cookie Lyon). Questlove and Black Thought of The Roots appeared as rappers who first perform solo but then decide to team up as a duo.\n\nOn December 12, 2017, a parody of both The CW television series \"Riverdale\" and the Peanuts specials as \"Peanuts\" aired. The skit had the gang's reactions to Linus' death in the pumpkin patch while waiting for the Great Pumpkin. The skit ended with a cameo appearance from the Riverdale cast in a hallway reacting to the Peanuts cast at a school dance.\n\nThe show's longest running musical sketch, Jimmy joins his house band, The Roots, to serenade the audience on a topic of current newsworthy significance in the style of a slow jam. For years, whenever the sketch aired, former \"NBC Nightly News\" host Brian Williams (or, as Jimmy calls him, \"Brilliams\" or \"Bri Will\" or \"Bri Will.I.Ams\") joined Jimmy in slow jams. The following have been topics of a Slow Jam:\n\nJimmy and men from the show's staff plus one of the guests from that night's episode will perform the \"Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?\" theme as Rockapella, except they will only sing rhythm and not vocals.\n\nJimmy is the frontman of a punk band similar to the Ramones called The Vanilla Wombats. Each of the band members dresses in black, with a black cape, dark sunglasses, and a platinum blonde wig. Their songs include \"My Upstairs Neighbors Are Having Sex (And Listening To The Black Eyed Peas)\" and \"I've Finally Accepted The Fact That I Wear Size 36 Jeans\".\n\n\"Blow Your Pants Off\", a CD and vinyl LP of the show's greatest hits, was released on June 12, 2012. The album cover shows a bottomless Jimmy lying down on his stomach, but he says a \"stunt butt\" was used. It won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album.\n\nJimmy has performed original songs such as \"I'm Gettin' Drunk on Christmas\", \"I'm Goin' Huntin' for Cougars\", one about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill called \"[Tar] Balls in Your Mouth\" (which Jimmy later revealed on the October 31, 2011 episode of \"Conan\" was his first choice for the name of his Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavor \"Late Night Snack\"), \"The Ballad of Steven Slater\", \"Gonna Eat That Talkin' Sandwich: The Sarah Palin Song\", \"The Ballad of Anthony Weiner\" (which repeatedly used the term \"sucks, Weiner\"), and \"Walk of Shame\" (accompanied by Dave Matthews). While Jimmy is singing, often some people wearing yellow tracksuits and sunglasses (usually including Seth Herzog and Mike Dicenzo, one of them without pants), as well as the Product Placement Preacher start dancing behind him. Jake Gyllenhaal joined in once as one of the Banana Boyz.\n\nIn 2010, country singer John Rich joined Jimmy for a duet of \"I'm Gettin' Drunk on Christmas\" which was later released on iTunes and became one of their most popular Christmas songs of the year.\n\nOn September 8, 2011, Eddie Vedder joined Jimmy for a duet of \"Balls in Your Mouth\".\n\nJimmy has solicited song titles from the audience, asking them to send him titles of songs for him to sing via Twitter; he picks the one he likes the best (e.g. \"Black Thought's Favorite Dinosaurs\" and \"I Love Your Elbows\") and performs a song with that title on the next night's show.\n\nJimmy impersonates singer Neil Young and sings a song. To date, he has sung the theme song to \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\", \"Pants on the Ground\" by \"General\" Larry Platt, an original song based on the \"Double Rainbow\" Internet meme, Willow Smith's \"Whip My Hair\" and LMFAO's \"Sexy and I Know It\" (duets with Bruce Springsteen), Miley Cyrus's \"Party in the U.S.A.\" (with David Crosby and Graham Nash, in a partial \"reunion\" of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young) and Iggy Azalea's \"Fancy\" (with Crosby, Stills & Nash).\n\nDuring Jimmy's week in Los Angeles in 2015, he performed a duet of \"Old Man\" alongside the real Neil Young.\n\nWhen Paul McCartney was a guest on the show, he confirmed that the working title of The Beatles song \"Yesterday\" was in fact \"Scrambled Eggs\". He and Jimmy went on to do a duet of the never-before-heard \"original version\", which was instead about their favorite food items.\n\nJimmy, Higgins, Tariq and Seth Herzog appeared as a boy band called The Miner 69ers, whose members were some of the rescued Chilean miners, and performed a song called \"There's Nothing Finer Than Sex With a Miner\".\n\nOn little celebrated holidays such as Election Day and Groundhog Day, The Roots' Captain Kirk Douglas performs a sex ballad called \"I'm Gonna Make Sweet, Sweet Love to You Woman on (holiday here)\", filled with double entendres and sexual innuendos.\n\nJimmy performed the \"Charles in Charge\" theme song as Bob Dylan. as a parody of \"I'm Not There\". In 2018, Jimmy performed The Times They Are a-Changin' with updated lyrics on a live post Super Bowl episode. Both segments were shown in black and white.\n\nAfter a cloud of smoke obscures the camera, Jimmy, the Roots, and some of the show's African-American writers (including Bashir Salahuddin) don dashikis and sing about snack foods (such as Hot Pockets or Ben & Jerry's) in the style of African choral group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. They once sang about Six Flags amusement parks as \"Ladysmith Theme Park Mombazo\".\n\nThe Ben & Jerry's version of the sketch began the show's relationship with that company, which ultimately led to the release of the show's official flavor, \"Late Night Snack\".\n\nJimmy as Eddie Vedder performed a parody of the Pearl Jam song \"Jeremy\" about basketball phenom Jeremy Lin of the New York Knicks.\n\nJimmy dresses in an amalgam of Ziggy Stardust-era David Bowie's costume, the face makeup from the cover of the Bowie album \"Aladdin Sane\", and NFL quarterback Tim Tebow's uniform and sings a song about events in Tebow's life to the tune of a Bowie song.\n\nThe first song (titled \"Tebowie\") was released as a 7\" vinyl record as a 2012 Record Store Day exclusive. (The B side was a cover of the \"Reading Rainbow\" theme song sung in the style of The Doors.)\n\nJimmy, Blake Shelton, Nick Offerman, and writer Chris Tartaro dressed up in chicken suits and sang The Lumineers' \"Ho Hey\", but replaced all the lyrics with chicken clucks, singing as the band \"The Chickeneers\" on a show before Easter in 2013.\n\nIn April 2013, Jimmy, Tartaro, Amy Poehler, and Michael Bublé formed the band \"cluck.\" and sang \"Some Nights\" by fun.\n\nOn November 4, 2015, Jimmy and Tartaro were joined by Meghan Trainor and Alanis Morissette to perform Morissette's \"Ironic\".\n\nNumerous clips of Brian Williams from \"NBC Nightly News\" broadcasts are edited together to make it look like Williams is rapping classic songs. So far the songs have been Snoop Dogg's part of \"Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang\", Warren G's \"Regulate\", Ice Cube's part of \"Straight Outta Compton\", Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch's \"Good Vibrations\", The Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight\" (which featured a verse by Lester Holt), Young MC's \"Bust a Move\", Snoop Dogg's \"Gin and Juice\", and Sir Mix-a-Lot's \"Baby Got Back\".\n\nSketch has not been performed since Williams' suspension from NBC News in February 2015.\n\nJimmy with the Roots join a musical celebrity to perform one of their hits on classroom instruments. These have included:\n\n\nJimmy and the Roots also did a classroom instruments version of \"Somebody Come and Play\" with the \"Sesame Street\" cast at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and performed a classroom instruments version of Daft Punk and Pharrell Williams' \"Get Lucky\" for the YouTube Rewind 2013.\n\nJimmy, Paul Rudd and the show's writers perform shot for shot recreations of music videos. These have included:\n\nJimmy and three other performers (and sometimes a fifth celebrity guest) sing a modern popular sing in the style of a barbershop quartet combined with reggae music.\n\n\nDressed to resemble their original performers, Jimmy and Kevin Bacon perform a parody of a classic song under the guise of it being an early draft of the actual lyrics.\n\nExamples have included \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" (where most of its lyrics were centered upon a hamburger stand, and eventually consisting entirely of the word \"hamburger\"), \"Free Fallin'\" (which focuses extensively on the interests of a woman mentioned in the first verse of the actual song, such as her apparent love of horses),\n\"American Woman\" (which had stanzas about an \"Australian Lawyer' and \"Canadian Dentist\"), and \"Legs\" (which had stanzas regarding other body parts).\n\nJimmy and Steve Higgins play fight commentators Brock Leonard and \"The Professor\" Barry Star on NBC's \"sister network\", the (fictitious) Steel Channel (a parody of Spike). The fight (or as Steel Channel calls them \"Stache Bash\" with a number and unique name for each one) takes place in an octagonal cage similar to that used for UFC bouts, with actual UFC referee and a bikini clad ring girl. Competitors thus far include the mustaches of Wilford Brimley, Geraldo Rivera, Gene Shalit, John Stossel, Carlos Santana, \"'80s Larry Bird\" (which also did a run-in), \"'70s Burt Reynolds\", \"'80s Tom Selleck\", \"'80s John Oates\", Dr. Phil McGraw, Albert Einstein, Lionel Richie, Herman Cain and Super Mario (with run-ins by \"'70s David Crosby\" (covered in a white powder), what was originally thought to be Charlie Chaplin's mustache that turned out to actually be the mustache of Adolf Hitler, \"'80s Dr. J\", and \"The Masked Mustache\" (wearing a luchador-style mask, whose identity was revealed during the \"Detective Jam Face\" ad)). The most recent bout was Ron Swanson vs. Yosemite Sam with run-ins by Wilford Brimley and Super Mario. (The mustache costumes are normally approximately six feet wide and completely cover the head and arms of the people inside them.) During the fight, a digital on-screen graphic advertising a new program on the Steel Channel - usually \"Detective Jam Face\" (played by A.D. Miles), but also once \"Mustaches on Ice\" (a Christmas special featuring the UMF competitors performing ice skating routines) - interrupts, covering the entire screen for a few seconds. When the ad goes away, we return to find the fight is over, with Brock and Barry proclaiming the finish a history-making event and the finishing move something they've never seen before and will probably never see again.\n\nAnother program on the Steel Channel (\"from the creators of Ultimate Mustache Fighter\") is \"Kicking Stuff\", where a man named Jonathan (Bobby Tisdale) takes ordinary objects, places them on top of an overturned orange bucket, and then kicks them off. After kicking the object, he points at the camera and yells \"Kicking stuff!\"\n\nAfter showing some footage from the show, Jimmy brings out Jonathan and has him kick something live in studio.\n\nThe Steel Channel's sports report, somewhat of a parody of \"SportsCenter\". Jimmy and Higgins play \"extreme\" anchors Cory van Funk and Bert Donovan, respectively. The report consists of a few segments: \"Check Out This Dude\", where they make fun of pictures of athletes; \"Point / Counterpunch\", where one anchor (usually Donovan) makes an argument and the other (usually van Funk) responds by punching him in the face; and \"Making Terrible Things Happen With Our Minds\", where video clips are intercut with close-ups of the anchors' faces concentrating, and then the person in the clip has an accident. In a recent version, Chris Kattan appeared as a depressed skateboarding teenager who reviews monster truck shows; when the hosts got him to open up about what was bothering him (beliefs he is unloved by his father), they cut him off and finished the sketch. The sketch ends with the anchors blowing on an animal horn to summon the \"T-shirt yeti\", who comes out and throws T-shirts into the audience.\n\nJimmy opens this sketch by saying, \"We're always striving to get better here at \"The Tonight Show.\"\" This is followed by him and The Roots imitating a bar from Daft Punk's \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\", which punctuates the camera zooming in on Jimmy four times. Suggestions ranging from the mundane (\"book Sandra Bullock soon\" or \"more audience member close-ups\") to the silly (such as \"have a stuntman dressed as Abraham Lincoln fall down the stairs\" or \"recreate the cover of Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" with a grown man instead of a baby\") are supposedly contributed by audience members. A frequent \"suggestion\" is to have Black Simon & Garfunkel (actually The Roots' Captain Kirk and Questlove, complete with an album cover parodying \"Bookends\") perform a current pop song in the style of a Simon & Garfunkel song (always ending with the \"lie-la-lie\" chorus from the song \"The Boxer\").\n\nIn this segment, Jimmy presents videos from a website <http://RobertIsBothered.com> that Robert Pattinson has set up to discuss things that bother him. Jimmy stars as Pattinson in character as Edward Cullen from the \"Twilight films\", but with his actual British accent. Throughout the segment he sits in a tree and talks about what bothers him, all from the perspective of Pattinson. Also making an appearance is a blow-up doll representing Kristen Stewart.\nThings bothering Robert include Daniel Radcliffe (a competing video shows Radcliffe as Harry Potter – also played by Fallon – is bothered by Pattinson), Shark Week, Snickers ads in magazines, Halloween costumes and candy, the novel \"New Moon\" and vampires in general, Valentine's Day, the iPad, the World Cup, and Thanksgiving. On March 1, 2010, celebrating Jimmy's first year of hosting, the real Pattinson came on to promote the film \"Remember Me\". During the sketch, he interrupted Jimmy, saying \"I don't talk like that!\" Jimmy then asked Robert how that made him feel, eventually getting him to say \"bothered!\"\n\nJimmy as Justin Bieber will sit by a reflecting pool and discuss topics that are on his mind. He will begin by talking about his own life (his appearance on \"\", his new position as host of \"Punk'd\"), but then start rambling on about more serious topics, such as John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories, the subprime mortgage crisis, his fears that China's economy will overtake that of the United States, and the debate over human cloning. It also shows him dancing, eating snacks, and receiving phone calls from other celebrities such as President Obama, Chuck Norris, and Alan Greenspan. (The real Bieber joined Jimmy-as-Bieber during the dance segments on the installment which aired the day before the release of Bieber's movie \"\".) At the end the segment, Bieber leaves in a magical fashion, such as walking on water, opening a wormhole, or transforming himself into golden retriever puppy Gary Frick from the \"If Puppies Could Vote\" sketch.\n\nAfter the November 2011 paternity rumors involving Bieber, Jimmy-as-Bieber came on the show and performed his new song, \"(It's Not My) Baby\".\n\nJimmy introduces a segment which will supposedly present images of two celebrities whose heads have been swapped through digital photo manipulation. A \"Head Swap\" song plays, ostensibly a short introductory jingle using sing-a-long lyrics and illustrated by a series of still photos. However, the song becomes an extended narrative set in the offices of \"Late Night\", depicting Jimmy asking a member of the show's graphics department to create \"Head Swap\" images. In each instance of the sketch, a different set of bizarre complications ensue, involving Jimmy in outlandish situations (such as the accidental death of a co-worker and their attempts to hide the body because the graphic artist is on parole didn't want to go back to prison for her murder; although at the end she was only unconscious) which push the actual \"Head Swap\" to a secondary issue. The conflict is eventually resolved, and only one image of a \"Head Swap\" is shown as the song ends.\n\nVarious members of the show's crew, and often one of the guests, read letters they have written to their parents in the manner of children at a summer camp. While they are reading, an overlay of the actual letter slowly comes into view. Lastly, Jimmy takes out some parchment, an ink well, and a large quill and proceeds to write his letter, in calligraphy, in Victorian era-style language with a voice to match.\n\nDuring the Christmas season, the letters are written to Santa Claus instead. In honor of the final episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", the sketch aired with letters written to Oprah Winfrey.\n\nA yearly Christmas tradition on the show (according to Jimmy) is bringing out a large board (the Countdown to Christmas Cabinet) with 12 numbered doors in the manner of an Advent calendar. The number of the door opened corresponds to the number of days left before the show's holiday break. Behind each door is a stereotypical Christmas sweater. Jimmy picks a number out of a Santa hat, and whomever in the audience has that number wins that day's sweater.\n\nIn 2013, an abbreviated version of the series (\"The 5 Days of Christmas Sweaters\") aired.\n\nIn a manner reminiscent of Oprah on her talk show, Jimmy gives a gift to the entire audience each day during the last week before the show's holiday break.\n\nJimmy plugs in his iPhone to a monitor to show off some new applications he's discovered. One of these apps always deals with a picture of the head of comedian Paul Reiser (such as \"ReiserTris\", a Tetris-like game with Reiser heads instead of the regular Tetris blocks). On a recent version, Jimmy used an app designed to locate Reiser, and it displayed \"I am 8 feet behind you\", then Reiser did a cameo. Another recurring app is \"Axl Rose Relaxation Tapes\", with the Guns N' Roses frontman (actually Jimmy) singing over relaxing sounds such as wolves howling or thunderstorms, usually ending with him yelling \"Take a nap!\"\n\nThe official \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" iPhone app, released November 10, 2010, has a feature called \"Jimmy's Phone\", which allows users to use some of the apps featured in the sketch, including \"Axl Rose Relaxation Tapes\", \"Moldova Y/N\" (which uses your phone's GPS to tell you whether or not you're currently in that eastern European nation), \"iBanana\" (which allows the user to virtually peel and eat a banana), \"Lint Brush\" (allowing users to virtually clean lint off themselves), \"Wet Cement\" (allowing users to virtually draw in wet cement), and \"Bieber yourself\" (allowing users to photoshop Justin Bieber's hair on to pictures of themselves).\n\nAfter Jimmy briefly mentions three trivial celebrity news items, he declares that the stories should be placed into the \"Who Cares \"Hindenburg\".\" Steve Higgins provides new narration to the classic newsreel footage of the destruction of the zeppelin \"LZ 129 Hindenburg\" (imitating Herbert Morrison's \"Oh, the humanity\" radio narration). The newsreel footage has had a news crawl featuring the three news items superimposed over the zeppelin to make it look like a modern blimp. The new narration always ends with the exclamation \"Who cares?\" A frequent target is Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz.\n\nWe listen in on Roots drummer ?uestlove as he thinks some quasi-intellectual thoughts such as \"what do you do when the fire escape catches on fire?\" or \"how do you throw out a trash can?\" (he cocks his head and looks off into the distance, nodding occasionally, as we listen to his pre-recorded narration).\n\nIn \"Post-Apocalypse Andy Rooney\", Jimmy plays former \"60 Minutes\" commentator Andy Rooney as he gives his thoughts about life in a world after a nuclear war and zombie uprising.\n\nAfter Rooney's retirement, the sketch became \"What is Andy Rooney doing now?\", showing how Rooney is spending his free time, (i.e. calling everyone in the phone book and ranting to anyone that will listen).\n\nJimmy stopped doing Rooney impressions after the real Rooney's death in late 2011.\n\nJimmy, claiming to be an expert on facial expressions, explains the meanings behind numerous expressions made by U.S. President Barack Obama. The expressions are usually explained by a short phrase (such as \"determined yet hopeful\"), until the end of the segment, which features pictures from President Obama's February 2009 meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper; at this point the phrases become overly long drivel about 1980s or 1990s youth popular culture (often food and sitcoms), reminiscing over minute details about the subject. Jimmy once did this segment with photos of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in place of Obama.\n\nSomewhat similar to \"Obama Expressions\", Jimmy shows a series of photos, each showing a man and a woman. Jimmy then explains what the people in the photos are thinking. The first person's thought is somewhat regular (e.g. \"I'm feeding him! This is so romantic!\" for a picture of a wife feeding her husband) while their partner's thought is a humorous rejoinder (e.g. \"She's feeding me! This is so humiliating!\").\n\nSimilar to He Said, She Said, photos of people with their pets are shown, with the pets' thoughts being the punchlines.\n\nJimmy reads off some famous quotes that he found on Facebook, along with some other quotes allegedly by the same person, but of dubious provenance. (E.g. Lance Armstrong: \"I'll spend the rest of my life trying to earn back trust and apologize to people for the rest of my life.\" Also from Armstrong: \"Are there any drugs that can help me do that?\")\n\nOften after a speech by President Obama, Jimmy will give a timeline of events, starting with actual statements from the speech. The bit will eventually introduce Vice President Joe Biden, who will interrupt Obama in the manner of a spoiled child.\n\nWhile cleaning his office, Jimmy claims to have found some VHS cassettes from a 1980s production company named Video Vision. The videos are usually short instructional pieces (such as \"Dealing with Sexual Harassment in the Workplace\"), or holiday guides with bizarre factual errors such as \"Christmas was founded in Downtown Europe\". They are hosted by Jimmy (as \"James\" Fallon) with a spiked haircut, thick glasses, cheesy sweater and faded jeans, and have many of the hallmarks of video production of the mid-80s, including low video quality, awkward scene transitions, choppy edits, low-quality special effects, and cheesy graphics which include typos and spelling errors. Portions of the video tape may have been \"accidentally\" taped over with 1980's sitcoms.\n\nJimmy finds some old tapes of men from a 1980s video dating service that used to tape in Studio 6-B called \"Cupid's Arrow\". The videos are low quality (possibly because they were produced by Video Vision). The men featured are unattractive losers, and Jimmy stated that most of them were probably still available.\n\nThe sketch was later made into a \"Dating Game\"-style TV show hosted by Tony Sanders (played by Higgins) with three of the men: Chester Mann (played by Salhudtin), a perverted part-time shoe salesman and freeloader; James Spadge (played by Miles), a nerd with unusual medical conditions; and Jose (played by Jimmy), a flamboyant musician; and a female audience member as the contestant, with the video quality downgraded to look like it was from the 1980s. Jose is always the winner.\n\nTo get the audience excited about the show's sponsors, a fake gospel preacher named Rev. Daryl Bivens (played by Bashir Salahuddin) preaches about the products. Products have included the Big Philly Cheesesteak from Subway, Previlosec heartburn medication, and Toby's Rock Salt.\n\nAfter Jimmy gives a shout-out to someone, Questlove asks Jimmy if he can give a shout-out to someone as well. After doing so, other members of the cast and crew (usually including Kamal Gray, writer Morgan Murphy, director Dave Diomedi (always to his wife and about their sex life), Tariq Trotter (usually about some sort of craft or cooking project; Trotter wears a blondish-red wig while demonstrating it), or a character played by Bashir Salahuddin) interrupt and ask for shout-outs to people or things of their own. At the end, Jimmy quickly recaps each of the shout-outs.\n\nJimmy shows a series of velvet Elvises (or \"velvet Elvii\" as Jimmy claims they are also called) showing Presley in contemporary situations, such as listening to an iPod, skydiving, or appearing alongside people like Neytiri from the movie \"Avatar\", Fox News commentator Glenn Beck, or the cast of \"The Big Bang Theory\". One of the velvet Elvises will usually include a pull-string activated \"voice box\" (Jimmy pulls the string and holds the painting in front of his mouth so the audience cannot see him providing the voice).\n\nThe last painting is often of Elvis in a beige jumpsuit performing a particularly boring activity (e.g. taking a nap after doing a crossword puzzle, sitting on a park bench feeding birds). After Jimmy comments on just how boring the activity is, a Boring Elvis impersonator comes out and sings a song about the activity.\n\nJimmy claims to have had a character left out of various movies and video games, such as \"\" or \"\". He shows us a series of outtakes of him spouting bad attempts at catchphrases. Jimmy will also sometimes enlist actors promoting new movies to be in outtakes from those movies with him (including Jude Law for \"Sherlock Holmes\" and Kim Cattrall for \"Sex and the City 2\").\n\nAfter Jimmy passingly mentions the Hubble Space Telescope, a man in the audience dressed head to toe in New York Yankees apparel named Milky J (Bashir Salahuddin) enthusiastically begins listing and showing photos of astronomical features photographed by the telescope, each one punctuated by him yelling \"Hubble gotchu!\" He also sang a song about it, and later showed a rap video he made. This sketch's timing may be based on the song \"Rock You\" by The Roots.\n\nHe appeared in a recent shout-outs sketch, sending shout-outs to molecular models. Jimmy said he recognized him and Milky J explained that since Hubble is being phased out and replaced by the James Webb Space Telescope, he'd found a new interest. Jimmy then convinced him that Hubble is still something to get excited about, which made him go back into his old shtick.\n\nLater, Jimmy mentioned a new planet, and Milky J showed up and went into his routine, but Jimmy once again mentioned how Hubble is being replaced by the James Webb telescope. Milky J then did a rap video about his trip to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland to try to convince them to stop the new telescope from being launched.\n\nMilky J recently appeared in another shoutouts sketch, this time giving a shoutout to gravity: breaking his unfaithful wife's valuables by dropping them and saying \"gravity got it\".\n\nJimmy begins telling a story, but a man in the crowd wearing a Hawaiian shirt and a New York Mets bucket hat (Mike Dicenzo) interrupts, linking the beginning of Jimmy's story to \"Late Night\" via an extended word association, after which he says \"how you like me now?\". After he does it twice, Jimmy does one as well, causing the man to declare Jimmy the superior player and leave the studio in shame, despite Jimmy's repeated attempts to make him stay.\n\nDuring the sketch that aired March 11, 2013, as Bucket Hat guy went to leave, Laina the Overly Attached Girlfriend appeared near the exit, wearing an identical Hawaiian shirt and bucket hat. Despite Jimmy's attempts to get the two of them together, Bucket Hat Guy retreated from the exit to the safety of Jimmy's guest chair.\n\nJimmy shows a clip from a late-night Tennis Channel show starring Roger Federer (played by Jimmy) called \"At the Bar with Roger Federer\", where the tennis star hangs out in a bar and does strange things, including performing yo-yo tricks, identifying objects (incorrectly) by smell, and discussing his love/hate relationship with his good friend but fierce competitor Rafael Nadal. The sketch only airs during Grand Slam Tennis Tournaments, the current one of which Federer discusses during \"The Sports\" segment. The most recent edition of this sketch involved Federer buying \"a round of drinks on the Federer,\" then serving a tennis ball between his legs so it causes John McEnroe's drink to spill, which in turn provokes McEnroe to stand up angrily and yell, \"Come on, Roger! God! You cannot be serious!\" The camera then cuts back to Federer, who casually says \"That one's on me,\" as if nothing happened.\n\nLess a full sketch and more a recurring bit, Jimmy will look directly into the camera and jets of fire of will emanate from his eyeballs. Sometimes, he will instead shoot laser beams. Less frequently, gobs of cooked spaghetti will come out. Jimmy will also have Steve Higgins, Questlove, and his celebrity guests play along with the gag as well. Jimmy claims the ability to do these things is a side effect of his LASIK surgery.\n\nWhen Jimmy has a professional wrestler as a guest, they will usually enter the studio through a cloud of smoke via a trap door in one of the aisles of the audience area.\n\nJimmy will read a pamphlet from an upcoming small town festival for that weekend. It is only done in the summer.\n\nJimmy tells a news story where a person/place/thing is compared to something/one else. He then compares the two usually ending in a punchline joke. In the July 21, 2014 episode he compared Toronto mayor, Rob Ford, with a horse.\n\nJimmy demonstrates how a common piece of advice, like \"let it flow\" can take on a very different meaning depending on who you are.\n\nJimmy reviews several terrible (real) albums and songs (such as Scooter's \"How Much Is the Fish?\", Michael Henderson's \"Slingshot\", Hulk Hogan's \"Hulk Rules\", two tracks off of \"Music To Eat Oscar Mayer Weiners By\" (Motown style and Bossa Nova style), and \"A Taste of Dick Black\"). Questlove, an avid music collector, always states he thinks the songs and artists are fake since he's never heard of them.\n\nOnce a month, Jimmy reviews several terrible (real) books (such as \"How to Avoid Huge Ships: Second Edition\", \"Castration: The Advantages and the Disadvantages\", \"Cooking With [Winnie the] Pooh\", and \"Knitting With Dog Hair\") and suggests people not read them.\n\nTogether with the guys from the Found Footage Festival, Jimmy presents selections from old low-quality instructional VHS videos and suggests the audience avoid them (such as the owner's video for the Rejuvenique face mask, \"Superchops 4 Bass with Beaver Felton\", and \"Fun with Ventriloquism\").\n\nDuring the show's Video Game Week, Jimmy showcased some terrible games, such as \"Hooters Road Trip\" for the PlayStation, \"Captain Novolin\" for the Super NES, and \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" for the Atari 2600.\n\nIn the wake of Charlie Sheen's post-rehab media blitz, Jimmy appeared as Sheen in two commercials: one selling his cologne \"Winning\", and the other selling a Time Life collection of CDs containing outrageous quotes by him. Later, in response to the news that Ashton Kutcher would replace Sheen on \"Two and a Half Men\", Jimmy as Sheen made a new version of Kutcher's old show \"Punk'd\" called \"Sheen'd\" in which he goes around acting obnoxious and bothering people at their jobs. The real Sheen (who also promoted his new show \"Anger Management\") later appeared alongside Jimmy-as-Sheen in an ad for \"Clone\" cologne.\n\nJimmy plays British TV show host Peggy Hess, who presents a series of clips of celebrities making small-talk at functions where they are not hooked up to microphones. Whispering voices are added to the soundtrack to show what the celebrities are saying, such as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie discussing putting \"Cool Runnings\" in their Netflix queue, Pope Benedict XVI showing Barack Obama his fan art of Garfield, and Gary Busey explaining to John C. McGinley how he punched a mountain lion in the face and then became best friends with it.\n\nJimmy sent a correspondent to the streets of New York to ask people their thoughts on different topics in the news while dancing their answers.\n\nIn an effort to make basic math more relatable for kids, Jimmy breaks down basic arithmetic using pop culture references and notable names (e.g. Larry David + Static electricity = Bernie Sanders).\n\nA series of animated shorts featuring a father (voiced by Jimmy) giving advice to his (silent) preteen son. This segment only airs on the Friday before Father's Day.\n\nJimmy showcases some items that he has found on sale at various stores. The price-reduction stickers have been strategically placed so that their names are more suggestive, turning a copy of \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\" into \"The Very Hung Caterpillar\" or a DVD of the show \"Picket Fences\" into \"Picket Feces\". A bath toy called \"Rub-A-Dub Work & Squirt\" was left alone.\n\nJimmy showcases some interesting electronic greeting cards he's discovered, with the insides being insulting to the receiver.\n\nJimmy talks about going onto a website that does computer text-to-speech conversions, and then mentions that the computer voice is based on that of a nerdy man named Walter Kump (John Haskell). He then brings out Kump for an interview, which shows off some of the comical mispronunciations, improper enunciation and misuse of punctuation (i.e. saying the word \"slash\" when a \"/\" appears in the script) that are prominent of computer-generated voices.\n\nKump later announced he has chosen a second career as a rapper and has recorded a music video, which Jimmy let him play on the show.\n\nKump also appeared after his girlfriend (who speaks in a female robot voice) made a video of him falling while he was rollerblading that went viral.\n\nKump's latest appearance had him announcing he played the hero in an action movie, co-starring Kyle MacLachlan as the villain, and had Jimmy play a climactic scene from it.\n\nJimmy reads a somewhat depressing story from the news and then gives the silver lining. (Example: There are growing concerns about the level of privacy on Facebook. On the bright side, there's a way to post all of your information online without anyone ever seeing it – join Myspace.)\n\nA parody of nightly news programs. It usually includes inane graphs; short, nonsensical weather reports; depressed sports anchors, and manipulated footage of celebrities where their faces are turned upside-down.\n\nBritish comedian Russell Brand (Jimmy) comments on articles in the latest issue of \"Us Weekly\". Some episodes have Brand reading \"Star\" instead. When the real Brand was on in February 2013, he appeared and said Jimmy's impression was terrible and read the magazine himself.\n\nOn August 9, 2012, Jimmy joined anchor Bob Costas in studio at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, and showed a version of the sketch with Brand reading the special Olympics edition of the magazine.\n\nJimmy boils down a week's worth of a TV show to one sentence to allow his viewers to more quickly catch up on them. The result is a humorous but still appropriate sentence, like Rachel Maddow from \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" being edited to say \"Newt Gingrich had an ultrasound, and it revealed a small horse inside his stomach.\" The title of the sketch is a take-off of the Ronco Showtime Rotisserie Grill's slogan \"set it and forget it\".\n\nJimmy as Mitt Romney attempts to reach younger voters with a video blog, however he proves he is out of touch with them instead.\n\nJimmy as Mitt Romney and Dion Flynn as President Obama have one on one private conversations about their Presidential debates. Both candidates criticize themselves and each other.\n\nAfter President Obama was re-elected on November 6, 2012, they re-enacted Romney's concession call to President Obama, with them reminiscing about the election, then performing a duet of Paula Cole's \"I Don't Want to Wait\".\n\nJimmy will mention celebrity rumors (the setups) then tell the truth behind them (the punchlines).\n\nJimmy shows some celebrity Twitter replies to (fake) fan questions, and then reveals the original question. (e.g. Dalai Lama's reply: \"Bountiful, rich, and abundant.\" Follower's question: \"Describe your ideal guacamole.\") The sketch is also similar in spirit to Johnny Carson's \"Carnac the Magnificent\" bits on \"The Tonight Show\".\n\nWhen Jimmy tells a joke in the monologue that he thinks is particularly cheesy, he will apologize then give away its cue cards to members of the audience.\n\nJimmy often refers to fictional men as Gary, who are usually unintelligent or acting obnoxious and people are letting him know this. He also refers to fictional misbehaving boys as Garrison (who hates that name and wishes his parents would call him Gary).\n\nJimmy and the gang take turns miming the saxophone solo of \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" while a recording of it is played.\n\nWhenever a story about Dunkin Donuts is mentioned, Jimmy says, \"Or as I call it, 'Funkin Gonuts'\", the Roots then play some funky music, which Jimmy dances to. After it ends, Higgins says, \"Donuts!\"\n\nFollowing a story in his April 23, 2014 monologue about a depressed panda in China, named Seesha, Fallon mentioned that scientists had put a TV in the cage to cheer up the panda. Fallon then told a couple panda jokes for Seesha, and after each joke, a man in a panda suit would cut in front of the screen and do a short dance. Eventually, he worked his way into the hallway where he kept dancing as the Roots continued to play his song. The panda returned the next night, and Fallon sent out a hashtag called #FallonPanda to gather name suggestions. The next night, it was announced the panda's name was \"Hashtag.\" The panda now frequently returns in monologues following a series of jokes, dancing all the way into the hall to the Roots' music. It was later revealed that Ben Stiller was the man in the Hashtag costume, although when Stiller returned as a guest, Chris Rock had taken over mascot duties. On May 17, 2017, as part of a promotion for her upcoming single, for \"The Voice\" coach Miley Cyrus took a turn inside the suit. During the show's first trip to Universal Orlando Resort in 2014, Hashtag was part of a dance-off against Stuff the Magic Dragon, the mascot of the Orlando Magic, which ended in a tie. Hashtag the Panda can be seen at the Universal Studios Florida attraction Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon for meet-and-greets and also appears inside the attraction.\n\nWhen the announcer Steve Higgins says a joke that is both very funny and very cheesy, he will \"retire\" by waiving to the crowd and walking off the stage. He will then come back, appearing exhausted, then explaining something crazy that happened to him that caused him to come back.\n\nOn other occasions, Fallon will \"retire.\" When either man \"retires,\" the Roots play blues music.\n\nWhenever his predecessor Jay Leno is a guest, Jimmy will feign an injury during the monologue (in the form of allegedly pulling a muscle) and Leno will have to \"tag in\" and take his spot for a few minutes while he recovers.\n\nOne occasion had Jimmy supposedly get a tickle in his throat while telling Hillary Clinton jokes. Billy Crystal took over for the remainder of the monologues.\n\nA segment introduced on the show's first episode, in which Jimmy invites audience members to come on stage and lick objects, such as a lawn mower or a bowling ball, for ten dollars. Drew Barrymore and Kelly Ripa have played the game as celebrities.\n\nIntroduced in the show's second week, this segment features a game with loosely defined rules and bizarre scoring whose theme song is an off-key version of \"The Final Countdown\". Three audience members are chosen to spin a wheel containing various carpet samples. The wheel includes a \"mystery sample\", which is revealed by the announcer to both the audience and the contestants prior to game play. Each contestant spins the wheel just once and is awarded a seemingly arbitrary point value (Jimmy tells the second contestant that the point value the first contestant scored is the maximum number of points a contestant can possibly get, and then asks if the second player thinks he or she can beat it). Each game contains the speed round with a \"carpet sample fun fact\": a piece of trivia, and the \"lightning round\" in which the contestant must \"name as many things as possible\" in three seconds (after which Jimmy names a thing that is none of the things the contestant mentioned), and a \"carpet sample cartoon break\", which is followed by a \"the making of\" featurette, then a \"the making of the making of\" featurette, then an epilogue of the makers of them. If a contestant lands on a piece that has already been won, Jimmy turns the wheel back five spaces. A seemingly arbitrary winner, chosen by Higgins (who wasn't paying attention because he was arguing with his wife on the phone), wins the sample of carpet on which the wheel stopped during their spin. The other two contestants each receive a consolation prize that turns out to be much more valuable than the winning contestant's prize, usually a $300 gift card to the Apple Store (the winning contestant is ultimately awarded the consolation prize as well).\n\nJimmy picks three random audience members to come down. They are shown a table covered in various \"prizes\", including a large-screen plasma TV (or a MacBook, or other similarly desirable popular item), tickets to a cleaning products convention, a used trumpet, lingerie, recorded VHS tapes, donuts for the entire audience, a box of rocks, a coffee mug, a year's worth of back issues of \"Orthopedics\" magazine, a pipe carved into Jimmy's likeness, a 15-second rave, and other similar kitschy items. A Sharp 108 shows a rapid-fire series of images of the objects available to be won, with each image only visible for 1/6 of a second. When Jimmy gives the cue, the contestants must snap a picture with their cellphone of whatever item is on the screen. The contestant wins whatever item of which they have taken a picture. One unlucky female contestant's phone was so slow to take a picture that all she photographed was the game's logo after the prizes had stopped flashing. As a consolation prize, she was awarded \"donuts for the entire audience\". A frequent prize is \"The Call of the Wolf Waker\": a man (Mike Dicenzo) covered head to toe in furs performs a wolf call using his cupped hands; while he is performing the call, footage of sleeping wolves waking up is shown. Another grand prize was 15 seconds in the VIP room with two Victoria's Secret models.\n\nIn a parody of \"Dance Your Ass Off\", Jimmy invites three audience members on stage and challenges them to put on a neon yellow wool knit cap and yellow rubber gloves and try to get them off only by whipping their body parts around. Jimmy warns that \"smurfing\" (wearing one's cap loosely and high on the head in the manner of a Smurf) is not allowed. Two points are awarded for removing a hat, with one point each for the gloves; ties are broken based on audience applause. The winner receives $300 in one dollar bills, although the bills are presented in strange ways, such as wadded up and stuffed in a plastic bag, stuffed into the hollow handle of a snow shovel, or taped end-to-end in a long chain. Losers receive a T-shirt. Jimmy closes the segment by reciting a rhyming verse, which in some instances of the sketch becomes absurdly long and about an embarrassing health problem Jimmy has such as genital warts.\n\nJimmy challenges three audience members to a karaoke contest where they sing quotes from a celebrity, including Nicole Polizzi, John Madden and Mel Gibson; most installments use quotes from American conservative politicians and commentators, including South Carolina governor Mark Sanford; Tea Party convention speakers Tom Tancredo, Joseph Farah, and Sarah Palin; Fox News hosts Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity; and, most frequently, Rush Limbaugh. One version featured quotes from the erotic novel \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". Another featured quotes from recent \"Celebrity Apprentice\" bootee Gary Busey. (This installment had only two audience members, with Busey himself also competing; Busey was named the winner, but Jimmy revealed that \"friends, family, and the actual Gary Busey\" were not eligible to receive prizes.) The most recent installment featured quotes from the cast of \"Duck Dynasty\". The winner, determined by audience applause, receives a karaoke machine, and losers receive T-shirts or hoodies.\n\nJimmy invites three guests on stage, and they must attempt to throw the most hot dogs through holes carved in the mouths of large (about 6 feet tall) celebrity faces. The celebrities are usually related somehow, such as the cast of \"New Moon\", the three men from the TV show \"Full House\", hosts on Fox News Channel, or politicians. (An installment of the game after the House vote on the 2010 health care legislation featured Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA); the Congressman's face had a smaller-than-usual mouth hole but added cutouts for his nostrils.) In the case of a tie, contestants participate in a sudden-death toss-off. The winner receives a hot dog toaster, and the losers receive a package of hot dogs.\n\nThree audience members play air drums (similar to air guitar) along to a short drum-heavy instrumental track played by The Roots. The winner is selected by audience applause, who receives a drum kit donated by Yamaha and Zildjian. The two losers receive drumheads autographed by The Roots.\n\nThree audience members are each shown three close-up photos of different man boobs, and are asked to pick which one belongs to a particular celebrity. The three photos are given punny names such as \"Areola 51\" or \"Yo Flabba-Flabba\". Winners receive a man boobs-themed wall calendar, and losers receive a \"Man Boobs\" T-shirt.\n\nTwo pairs of audience members compete. One member of each pair rolls a specially marked die to determine whether they will be spitting or receiving. The spitter takes a sip of water, and then the receiver recites the punch line to a provided joke (usually in the form of \"[Normal phrase]? I thought you said [similar-sounding sexual phrase]!\"), at which the spitter performs their best spit-take. Audience applause determines the winning team. Sometimes, Jimmy will have the spitter and receiver switch positions if their first spit-take is particularly good or they have extra time. The winning team receives a pair of hand towels embroidered with the \"Competitive Spit-Takes\" logo, while the losing team receives a pair of moist towelettes.\n\nThree audience members select styles of dance (e.g. Irish stepdance, ballet, or disco) out of Jimmy's \"Velvety Dance Bag\", and then attempt to perform that dance style after being hung by a harness ten feet in the air. The winner is selected by audience applause. The winner receives a dancing-themed prize, such as Nintendo Wii and a dancing game or Arthur Murray dancing lessons, while the losers receive T-shirts.\n\nBefore the show, Jimmy selects members of the audience who are musicians but do not otherwise know each other. They are split into two \"instant bands\" and are given about half an hour to come up with a band name, design an album cover, and write a song to perform. Winners are determined by audience applause. Winners receive the instruments they played and a $300 gift certificate to Guitar Center, while the losers receive T-shirts.\n\nOn the June 15, 2011 show, Jimmy hosted the finalists in \"Rolling Stone\" and Garnier Fructis' \"Choose the Cover\" contest (Lelia Broussard from Los Angeles, California, and The Sheepdogs from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan). Prior to the show, a member of the audience (Terry Patterson from the San Francisco area) was selected and both bands had to write a song about her. Each member of both bands received a \"Late Night\" T-shirt, and the winning band (The Sheepdogs) received 20 pints of Jimmy's Ben & Jerry's flavor, \"Late Night Snack\".\n\nSimilar to Battle of the Instant Bands, Jimmy assembles two dance crews from the audience and has them each choreograph a dance routine in under an hour. The winners each receive $300 gift cards from J.Crew, while the losers win $100 gift cards.\n\nSimilar to Battle of the Instant Bands, Jimmy selects three singer/songwriters from the audience and has them write a short song based on a different nonsensical phrase like \"turtle sunrise\" or \"clouds are people too\". The winner receives a $300 gift card to Guitar Center, while the losers receive $100 gift cards.\n\nTwo audience members are given a scene to perform with Jimmy in reverse (walking backward, etc.). After they complete the scene, the footage is then shown reversed so that it looks normal. The winner is determined by audience applause, who receives a piece of reversible clothing (such as a jacket or a jersey), while the loser receives a tshirt with a reversed \"Late Night\" logo.\n\nTwo teams of three male audience members race in a relay to pass a Spanx body-shaping undergarment over their bodies as fast as possible. After taking the garment off of a mannequin, the first person steps into it and then pulls the garment over his head. The next team member then pulls the garment over his head and off over his feet. The third team member reverses direction once again and pulls the garment on feet-first. After pulling the garment over his head, the third team member then races to deposit the garment in a basket (the \"Spanx Bank\"). The other team members may assist in the passing of the garment, but cannot bunch it up or fold it onto itself. The winning team wins \"Late Night\" compression T-shirts and a pair of Spanx, and the losers receive regular \"Late Night\" T-shirts..\n\nThree audience members \"try to decipher the garbled-mouth ramblings of Rickie Johnston, a pig farmer with a real anger-management problem,\" according to Jimmy. Johnston (played by Bobby Tisdale) is a stereotypical redneck, dressed in a pair of overalls, a trucker's hat, and no shirt, in addition to a huge mouthful of chewing tobacco and an exaggerated Southern accent. The game has three rounds, worth 10, 100, and 1000 points. The first two rounds vary, but the third round is always \"What's On Rickie's Mini-Dish Tonight?\", which involves Johnston acting out a scene from a movie and the contestants must guess its title. The winner of the first installment of the game had the choice between a chocolate-covered horseshoe and a \"beer-amid\" (a pyramid made from cement-filled beer cans) as a prize and chose the beer-amid. The second installment of the game had as its prize a package of paper plates. The third installment awarded a watch made from a can of chewing tobacco. The losers receive a bag of frozen tater tots, with Jimmy giving Rickie a bag as well (they're his favorite).\n\nThree audience members are shown pictures of non-celebrities and each must guess the first and last name of the person shown. The images of non-famous men flashes quickly with one of a famous man second to last (usually 1990s sitcom stars). The first two contestants get a single guy to name, but the last contestant plays the \"lightning round\", where they try to name eight guys in 20 seconds. They show's grand prize, $15,000, has never been won, but the losers (all contestants are invariably losers) receive a T-shirt with their person's name on it (Higgins encourages all contestants to \"wear your shame in style\"). The spirit of the game is similar to \"Wheel of Carpet Samples\". Due to \"lack of budget\", the segment uses scene transition graphics from \"Home Improvement\" between contestants. It also features \"Name That Guy Fun Facts\" like \"[non-famous man]\" was born in Cincinnati, Ohio\".\n\nActor Charlie Day played the game's lightning round on the July 11, 2013 episode.\n\nJimmy claims this is \"the game that everyone is talking about.\" This is followed by five brief video clips of five different people (Oprah Winfrey, Chris Rock, Hillary Clinton, Brian Williams, and Glenn Beck) strung together so it sounds like they are saying the sentence, \"I love Models and Buckets.\" The twelve models are brought out and Jimmy will ask them an open ended question, such as \"How was your weekend?\", with each giving a different answer simultaneously. Jimmy then brings in two male audience members who singularly select alternately a bucket held by each model (similar to \"Deal or No Deal\") that is filled with an item such as food (e.g. orange soda, baked beans, or chocolate syrup), confetti, or packing peanuts to be tipped over the contestant's head by that model. The hope is to find the bucket that contains fake $1 bills. The losing contestant receives a \"Late Night\" bucket hat (Jimmy and The Roots then begin a rap interlude about the bucket hat). The initial installment of the game used 16 buckets instead of 12. When only six buckets remain, the game enters the \"double trouble\" phase, where each contestant selects a bucket to be tipped simultaneously. If a contestant wins early in the game, Jimmy will have the models reset with new buckets and the contestants play a second game for another $100. In one installment, both contestants won $100, and the bucket hat was not awarded. Contestants also a receive new clean clothing backstage afterwards.\n\nJimmy had audience members roll a twenty-sided die with a letter on each face (likely taken from the game Scattergories) and say as many words that start with that letter, with rules such as no proper nouns, no long pauses between words, etc. Contestants win $10 cash for each correct word.\n\nWhile two audience members are blindfolded and wear noise-canceling headphones on stage, Jimmy selects another audience member to come down and photocopy their face; after doing so, that person returns to their seat. Singularly each of two contestants are given the photocopy and the task to run into the audience to find the photocopied person. While they are searching, the Roots play music whose tempo slows or fastens depending on how \"hot\" or \"cold\" the contestant is in their search. The contestant that finds the photocopied person fastest is declared the winner and receives a desktop printer/fax/scanner/copier, while both the loser and the photocopied person receive a ream of copy paper.\n\nThree blindfolded audience members attempt to break ball-shaped piñatas with smiley faces on them (which \"bear a striking resemblance to celebrities in the news\") rotating around them using only karate kicks. Ties are broken by \"kicking awesomeness\" (as voted on by the audience). The winner receives $300 worth of Old El Paso boxed taco kits (brought out by Gwar and Dwar), while the losers receive \"Late Night\" black belts.\n\nFive audience members each donate one of their possessions to a communal \"jackpot\". Jimmy spices it up by adding the contents of a wallet in his pocket, including $500 (sometimes in cash, sometimes as a gift card to the Apple Store).\n\nEach of the five audience members has their name on a tile in a bucket. Jimmy singularly pulls a tile from the bucket to eliminate contestants until only one contestant is left, who wins everything in the jackpot. The other four contestants receive \"Late Night\" T-shirts or sweatshirts.\n\nThree audience members are singularly shown a collectible doll for five seconds, and then have thirty seconds to assume the pose of the doll as closely as possible using a box of props and costumes. Contestants that have yet to play are placed beneath large blue sensory-deprivation \"domes of silence\". The winner is chosen by audience applause; in the first installment, the winner received a three-foot-tall Barbie doll, but in later installments the prize was $100 and the doll the contestants were imitating. Losers receive doll-sized \"Late Night\" T-shirts.\n\nA series of stunts, each with an associated point value, cycles rapid-fire on the \"Dartboard of Insanity\" (the Sharp 108). Three audience members singularly shoot a Nerf dart gun at the Dartboard, stopping the cycle on a particular stunt. Whichever contestant completes the stunt with the highest point value is declared the winner. All three contestants receive $100 and either a T-shirt or a \"beer koozie sweatshirt\" (a sweatshirt with a pocket for a beer bottle on the front), although only the winner receives his $100 in the form of a giant check.\n\nOnly a few of the \"available\" games are ever played. Some of the games are highlighted by Jimmy before the game; some are named and also described – these are usually over the top. Still others only ever appear in the rotation. The last game to be played is always \"Dude Spoon\". (Some contestants land on \"Dude Spoon,\" but are given the option to spin again; they then land on \"Double Dude Spoon\", where they have to spoon with two dudes instead of just one.) The point value of games can vary from episode to episode.\n\nAvailable games include:\n\n\"In the rotation only\": Beat Your Meat (3 points), Believe it or Snot (6 points), Bride of Spanxenstein (5/6 points), Emission Possible (3 points), Fish Sandwich (3 points), Germs of Endearment (6 points), Hog-Tied and Lovin' It!

(12 points), Peanut Butter Pickle Face (3/5/6 points), Pickle Tickle (3/6 points), Purple Nurple (12 points), Sausage-Link Jump Rope (6 points), Veggie Wedgie (3 points), and Whack-A-Sack (3 points)\n\n\"Described\": Cat Nips (10 points – the contestant is strapped down and catnip is sprinkled on their nipples, and 12 cats are let loose to \"go to town\" on them), Expired Milkshake of Pain (12 points – the contestant must think about an expired milkshake while being shocked with a cattle prod), Fondles the Clown (3/10/12 points – a guy is taken off the street, dressed up like a clown, and tickles the contestant in his \"swimsuit area\"), Goblet of Shame (12 points – involves a medieval goblet and full frontal nudity), Hula Hoop of Horror (12 points – the contestant hula hoops while 15 strangers wearing hoods shock him with cattle prods), Jelly Sock of Death (3/10 points – the contestant is hit with a sock filled with jelly), Rabbit Punch (12 points – the contestant names a number from 1 to 12, and then a guy dressed in a rabbit costume punches them in the back as hard as he can), and Stank Hose (12 points – the contestant is whipped with a smelly garden hose)\n\n\"Played\": Blindfold Balloon Pop (5 points – a blindfolded contestant must pop 3 balloons by stomping on them), Dude Spoon (10/15 points – the contestant must spoon with a guy named Sebastian (Seth Herzog)), Egg Head (5 points – the contestant must put a large Easter egg on his head and dance the \"ancient mystical dance of the egg-head\"), Grab the Balls in Your Nutsack (10 points – while blindfolded, the contestant must determine how many blue balls are in a large sack filled with circus peanuts), Guac Head (3/4 points – the contestant has guacamole smeared into his hair), \"Late Night Snack\" Slip 'n Slide (5 points – the contestant traverses a Slip 'n Slide lubricated with melted ice cream), Hot Dog in a Hole (5/10 points – a solo version of the regular game; the contestant tries to score 7 hits), Look at Yourself (12 points – the contestant must look at themselves in a mirror for 30 seconds without laughing while Jimmy goads them), Nutsack Attack!!

One of the contestants tries to answer trivia questions; each correct answer earns the team $100, but for each incorrect answer, the non-answerer has a portion of his chest hair removed with hot wax. Unfortunately, all of the questions are in obscure \"Jeopardy!\"-like categories such as \"Latvian Prime Ministers\", \"13th-Century South American Architecture\", and \"Much Ado About 'Quantum Mechanics'\" (\"you'll notice 'quantum mechanics' is in quotes\", says Jimmy). The last regular question is played in the \"double trouble\" format, where two portions of hair are at stake. The question is usually in the category \"Numbers\", and the question is usually \"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 1000 – what is it?\" (After the contestant gives his guess, Jimmy offers him the chance to change his guess. After doing so, Jimmy reveals the correct number was actually their first guess.) The \"lightning round\" features categories flashing by quickly, with easy categories like music, TV, and movies being skipped over for another difficult category at the end. As a consolation prize, the contestants are given \"Ed Zeppelin\" T-shirts (also a prize in the \"Wheel of Game Shows\" game) and a 24-pack of Nad's body hair removal strips. To date, no one has answered a single question correctly.\n\nThe person being waxed in the installment that aired May 15, 2011, was New York Jets center Nick Mangold.\n\nAnother surreal game in the spirit of \"Wheel of Carpet Samples\". Three audience members play mini-games selected by pressing the \"game pud\" (a buzzer) as the options rotate on the Sharp 108 (similar to the game show \"Press Your Luck\"). If a player lands on a picture of actor Steve Guttenberg, however, they lose their turn and owe the show $75 (similar to \"Press Your Luck\" \"Whammy\"). To this end, Jimmy urges the contestants to shout \"No Guttenbergs!\" as the monitor rotates.\n\nGames available include: \"Animal Farm\", \"Brownie Points\", \"Dance Dance Dance\", \"Drawing Board\", \"Find the Red Tissue\", \"Grab the Cupcake\", \"Grocery List\", \"Guess the Card\", \"Hands in Your Pants\", \"\"Harry Potter\" Trivia vs. the Roots\", \"Heads or Tails?\", \"Hide the Shoe\", \"\"iCarly\" Trivia vs. the Roots\", \"Jellybean Jar\", \"Magnet Scramble\", \"Number Jumbler\", \"Number Scramble\", \"Picture Puzzle\", \"Remember That Episode of \"Full House\"\", \"Rock, Paper, Scissors, Nuclear Warhead\", \"Snap Judgment\", \"Tarantula Bonanza\", \"True or False\", \"Wet Nap Face Slap\", \"What's In The Box?\", \"What's the Difference?\", \"Where Did You Get That Shirt?\", \"Word of the Day\", \"Yes or No\", and \"You Can't Possibly Win!\".\n\nAfter all contestants inevitably tie at zero points since Jimmy doesn't tell them how to play the games, even after a \"tiebreaker\" (such as \"Brownie Points\", \"Shut Your Pie Hole\", or \"Egg On Your Face\"), they all receive copies of the \"Saturday Night Live\" board game (with three pieces missing) and Led Zeppelin T-shirts where the first \"L\" has fallen off so that they read \"Ed Zeppelin\". (Later installments of the game substitute a copy of Jimmy's CD \"Blow Your Pants Off\" for the \"SNL\" board game.)\n\nTwo audience members compete. Each is blindfolded and fed a cracker with three different foods on top (such as pepperoni, peanut butter, and Swedish fish). They must try to name as many of the ingredients as they can. The winner receives a $300 gift certificate to Whole Foods, while the loser gets to interact with a celebrity impersonator (such as Abraham Lincoln or young Santa Claus) (and is also given a $150 gift certificate to Whole Foods).\n\nThree audience members compete. They are each given three nouns (an object, a place, and a name - e.g. Barbie Doll, France, and Charlie Sheen) they must work into a 30-second freestyle rap. The nouns are generated by \"Rhyme Wave\", a \"robot\" (played by Tariq Trotter) with a computerized voice that appears on the Sharp 108. The winner is determined by audience applause. The winner receives a TASCAM pocket studio digital recorder, while the runners-up receive \"Late Night\" T-shirts, notepads, and pens to write down their own raps.\n\nTwo audience members compete. Each is played a new song by the Roots that they must memorize and then immediately perform. The contestant that has yet to play is placed beneath a large blue sensory-deprivation \"dome of silence\". The winner is determined by audience applause, who is given a $100 bill and a burned CD with their song rendition on it, while the loser receives a \"Late Night\" T-shirt.\n\nThree audience members compete. Each is given a topic by Jimmy and is given 10 seconds to give as many words as possible relating to that topic. After time is up, they are given a score by the \"Brainmaster\" (Mike Dicenzo, wearing a brown robe, turban, and a large, light-up brain). The winner is given a special prize in an ornate wooden chest (selected by the Brainmaster). The two losers receive cans of Turtle Wax. (The winner's prize, coincidentally, is also Turtle Wax.) (In one playing, the contestants received giftcards to Subway, and the winner also received a bag of potato chips autographed by Tony Danza.)\n\nThree audience members compete. They are each given a song to sing karaoke-style – with the catch that they will be wearing noise-canceling headphones so they cannot hear themselves sing. Also, cowboy DJ Munson Rawlings (Gerard Bradford) will be manipulating the pitch of the song, which they must match. The winner is determined by audience applause, who wins a pair of noise-canceling headphones, while the losers receive \"Late Night\" hoodies.\n\nOn May 15, 2013, Jimmy invented a new game. Two audience members, a young man and a young woman, were invited to the stage for a dancing competition. Jimmy placed them on either side of a small barrier (so that they could not see each other), then he called out the names of made-up dances which they performed for a few moments, while the Roots played music. The dances Jimmy announced were \"The Bro-Bot,\" \"The Freaky Frog,\" \"The Elevator,\" \"The Disco Dentist,\" \"Hand Dancin',\" \"The Sexy Sway,\" and \"The Flying Tornado.\" To choose a winner, Jimmy proposed a \"Blank-Off\" and pressed the \"Button of Boogie.\" A prepared slot machine gave each contestant three \"random\" words for a final dance: the young woman was given \"Pogo Stick Paperboy\" and the young man received \"The Glowing Thong.\" The contestants performed their interpretations of these last dances, as before, and then received prizes.\n\nIntroduced in the third week of the show, this segment consists of the audience and show members participating in an experience together. In the first show, these experiences were to eat a Warhead sour candy, wear a Snuggy, and make a bird call. Other \"Shared Experiences\" have involved playing with an inflated beach ball and shooting Nerf guns at A.D. Miles while he quietly played Jenga by himself.\n\nDuring the show's first week, on March 5, 2009, Jimmy picked three random audience members and elected one of them to be president of the audience for the night. Later that night, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow appeared in a breaking news segment and reported that his approval ratings were dropping. Attack ads from his opponent were also shown, accusing the president of being a flip flopper when it came to liking Jimmy's jokes. The old president was later \"impeached\" on April 17, 2009, and a new president was appointed.\nOn March 10, 2010, after Jimmy complained that neither of the previous presidents ever showed up to work, he \"elected\" a new president by picking one audience member at random. Jimmy gave the new president a \"presidential starter kit\", including a copy of the \"Late Night\" by-laws, a quill pen, a carton of cigarettes, a stapler, and a first lady with \"shapely arms\". After an attack ad on behalf of another audience member, \"NBC Nightly News\" weekend anchor Lester Holt gave a news report about the president's short term thus far.\n\nA recurring sketch in which audience members are called upon to stand in for celebrities who are having public feuds and come to a mutual understanding. Segments have included two men as Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Aniston, two white women as 50 Cent and Rick Ross, Perez Hilton and Carrie Prejean, Adam Lambert and Clay Aiken, and Glenn Beck and Keith Olbermann. One sketch involved four audience members reenacting the feud between Paula Abdul, Randy Jackson, Simon Cowell, and Ryan Seacrest regarding the new contract offered to Mr. Seacrest as the host of \"American Idol\" and the fact that she wasn't made a similar offer by the show's producers (she would eventually announce that she was not returning to the show).\n\nJimmy asks audience members random questions. House band The Roots then makes up a song about them on the spot using that information in a music style of Jimmy's choosing (reggae, '80s pop, doo-wop, etc.). When Ringo Starr was a guest on the show, there was an all-Beatles version; during \"Rolling Stones Week\", there was an all-Stones version. While the show was in Indianapolis for Super Bowl XLVI, the Roots were joined in freestylin' by the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra.\n\nOn the September 11, 2012 episode, one of the audience members selected was Andy Murray; The Roots did a song about him winning the 2012 US Open in the style of Scottish band The Proclaimers. On the October 2, 2012 episode, Alec Baldwin was selected; his song was about the seventh and final season premiere of \"30 Rock\".\n\nThe camera isolates on random audience members and a Facebook status for them appears which says an intimate personal thought about them.\n\nSame aspect of \"What's on Your Facebook?\", the camera isolates on random audience members and a graphic of an iPod appears showing what songs the person has on theirs, which is usually something extremely personal or obscene.\n\nThree audience members are hooked up to the \"Think-O-Sync-ometer\" (a box with a red button, later renamed the \"Intel Think-O-Sync-ometer 8500\") by wearing a \"wireless Think-O-Read-ometer headband\" (an elastic headband with a suction cup), making sure that the \"cerebral cortex nipple\" is facing out. They are then asked to concentrate for 15 seconds on a particular subject provided by Jimmy. Then, after pressing the button on the Think-O-Sync-ometer, Jimmy \"pokes\" each contestant's cerebral cortex nipple, allowing the Think-O-Sync-ometer to \"project\" the audience member's thoughts.\n\nJimmy selects members of the audience and puts their cellphones into the \"Hacker 9000\" (which Jimmy claims is top-secret technology that only he and Rupert Murdoch know about), which scans the phone and plays the last received voicemail, which is usually something embarrassing (like a bookstore calling to let them know the Justin Bieber books they ordered have come in, or a gay strip club offering a man a job, or a man's college roommate reminiscing about drunken pranks).\n\nJimmy provides the audience with paper and packs of markers and asks them to draw whatever they want. He then goes into the audience and reads off some audience members' names and has them show off their drawings.\n\nEvery night during the week of February 7 to 11, 2011, the \"Late Night\" crew choose one male audience member with straight hair and gave him a perm. He was interviewed with friends before the procedure, then the perm was revealed during the show. Jimmy wore a perm wig during the sketches.\n\"Late Night\" Perm Week returned May 21 to 25, 2012, as well as July 15 to 19, 2013.\n\nJimmy showcases children with weird talents like reciting 86 digits of π or contorting their body into the shape of a pretzel while eating a soft pretzel. Jimmy then gives each child a Hawaiian shirt and a metal detector (an homage to his own childhood pastime of searching for buried treasure in his backyard).\n\nAn homage to \"America's Got Talent\", Jimmy selects members of the audience and has them demonstrate a talent or perform a trick.\n\nJimmy plays the popular drinking game beer pong with a celebrity guest, including Serena Williams, Ivanka Trump, Betty White, and John McEnroe. They play the paddle-less version (\"Beirut\"). The first player to sink two balls wins (increased to three balls when Jimmy played McEnroe). When Jimmy played Kathie Lee Gifford, they played the \"classier\" version \"wine pong\" using glasses filled with chardonnay. When Jimmy played Gina Gershon, they drank tequila shots instead of beer. When Jimmy played with Mariah Carey, they played \"champagne pong\" using glasses filled with Dom Pérignon rosé.\n\nCurrent standings:\nIn a light-hearted attempt to reclaim the honor of his \"The Proposal\" co-star Betty White, who at the time was the only celebrity Jimmy had defeated in beer pong, Ryan Reynolds played Jimmy in a game of beer shuffleboard. The two later played another game after a dispute arose over an interpretation of the rules of the game.\n\nOn the March 27, 2009 episode, Fallon explained that he had watched an episode of \"Saved by the Bell\" that morning. The episode he watched was \"The Prom\", where Kelly opted to give the money she had saved to go to the prom with Zack to her father, who had just lost his job. Fallon commented on the absurdity of Kelly's father losing his job at a weapons plant because \"world peace had broken out\", and also pointed out that the year 2009 is the twentieth anniversary of \"Saved by the Bell\". Fallon then decided to launch a campaign to persuade the original cast of \"Saved by the Bell\" to appear in a reunion special on his show. Dennis Haskins, who portrayed Mr. Belding, was the first to agree to take part in the reunion, and appeared on the show the same night Fallon launched the campaign. On April 3, 2009, it was announced that Lark Voorhees, who portrayed Lisa Turtle, would also be joining the reunion, making her the second \"Saved by the Bell\" guest. On April 24, 2009, Mario Lopez appeared on the show. After helping Fallon re-enact almost verbatim the climactic scene of the episode \"Save the Max\" in which the \"Saved by the Bell\" gang put together a pledge-drive to save The Max (altered to \"Late Night\" putting on a pledge drive to reunite the \"Saved by the Bell\" cast), he agreed to appear on the reunion.\n\nOn June 8, 2009, Mark Paul Gosselaar appeared on the show as a guest to promote his series \"Raising the Bar\". When he came out on stage, he was dressed as his \"Saved by the Bell\" character Zack Morris and claimed that since graduating college, he had been living in Los Angeles, working as an actor named Mark Paul Gosselaar because \"there was already a Zack Morris in SAG\". After agreeing to appear on the reunion, he received a phone call, on his signature oversized early-1990s–era cell phone, from Jessie Spano; Gosselaar then informed Fallon that Elizabeth Berkley had also agreed to appear on the reunion. At the end of his appearance, Gosselaar sang \"Friends Forever\", a song performed by the \"Saved by the Bell\" gang's band \"Zack Attack\". Fallon and The Roots also performed with him.\n\nOn March 4, 2010, Fallon said \"it looks like the dream [of a reunion for \"Saved by the Bell\"] is over.\" However, on that night's show, he reunited the cast of the show \"California Dreams\" (which aired \"right after \"Saved by the Bell\"\" on NBC) instead. Dennis Haskins made a brief appearance, confusing the two reunions. \"California Dreams\" cast members Brent Gore (Matt Garrison), William James Jones (Tony Wicks), Heidi Noelle Lenhart (Jenny Garrison), Kelly Packard (Tiffani Smith), Jay Anthony Franke (Anthony Sommers), Jennie Kwan (Sam Wu), and Michael Cade (Sly Winkle) briefly discussed what they're doing now: Gore is working with a non-profit in Los Angeles, Jones is attending Pepperdine University in pursuit of a master's degree in clinical psychology, Lenhart is a mother of two, Packard is a mother of three and had a small part in the then-upcoming film \"My Girlfriend's Boyfriend\", Franke is living in Australia with his wife and had recently finished filming a television pilot he created himself, Kwan (who became tongue-tied and blushed after being introduced) had toured with the traveling production of the musical \"Avenue Q\" and did a lot of voice acting (including the character Suki from the Nickelodeon animated series \"\"), and Cade works with the company Oxcyon and had a couple of films coming out that summer. The seven cast members then played the \"California Dreams\" theme song as the show went to commercial.\n\nIn February 2015, the \"Saved by the Bell\" cast was finally reunited (excluding Dustin Diamond and Lark Voorhies) and reprised their roles for a sketch which had Jimmy as a new student at Bayside High, and revealed Zack Morris had impregnated Kelly Kapowski (Tiffani Thiessen is pregnant in real life).\n\nJimmy and a celebrity guest take turns trying to make three-point shots on a basketball goal using objects like a telephone or a bowl of Count Chocula cereal.\n\nJimmy and a celebrity surprise people at the Top of the Rock by photobombing their pictures.\n\nJimmy and a celebrity guest each pair with an audience member to play charades. Jimmy has played with Cameron Diaz, Amy Poehler, and teamed up with Poehler to take on the then-husband/wife team of Fred Armisen and Elisabeth Moss. He also teamed up with his former \"SNL Weekend Update\" partner Tina Fey to play against their successors as \"Weekend Update\" anchors, Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers. Jimmy teamed up with Nene Leakes to take on the team of Donald Trump and Lil Jon after Trump announced Leakes and Lil Jon as cast members for \"The Celebrity Apprentice\" on that night's episode. Sometimes Jimmy and Steve Higgins will each pair with a celebrity to play (Tariq Trotter from The Roots sometimes also plays if only one other celebrity is playing).\n\nJimmy and a celebrity guest each pair with a member of the audience and play a game of Celebrity. The game is played in three rounds, each using 16 possible celebrity names as answers. During the first round, the clue-giver can give as much of a clue as they want. During the second round, the same set of names is used, but the clues are limited to three words. During the third and final round, the same names are used again, but the clue-givers may only use gestures (like in charades).\n\nJimmy and a celebrity guest each pair with an audience member, or with two other celebrities, to play a version of the board game Pictionary. Guest players have included Tina Fey (October, 2012), Jennifer Aniston, Melissa McCarthy, Lenny Kravitz, CeeLo Green, Katie Couric, and many others.\n\nJimmy and a partner battle a celebrity guest and their partner in a game where each player takes turns doing impressions as clues to get their partners to guess mystery celebrity masks each other is holding up.\n\nWhile Jimmy is interviewing an actor, he casually mentions a mid-90s action film they were both in called \"Space Train\" (about people who have to save the Earth by going to outer space, but are afraid to fly, so they take a train into space). After the actor claims not to remember the movie, Jimmy shows a \"clip\" from the movie (acted out live by the two of them). Participating actors include Robert De Niro (on the show's first episode), Anna Faris, Ben Kingsley, Will Arnett, and Sir Richard Branson.\n\nWhen \"Saturday Night Live\" writer/actor Seth Meyers appears as a guest, Jimmy will sometimes bring out Meyers' younger brother Josh and have them play a version of \"The Newlywed Game\". Jimmy asks Seth a series of questions while Josh wears a pair of noise-canceling headphones, and then gets Josh to guess what Seth gave for answers. The brothers then switch positions, with Josh answering and Seth guessing.\n\nJimmy plays a game of tic-tac-toe with a celebrity guest that has them flinging slingshot \"party monkeys\" into buckets.\n\nJimmy plays a game of war with a celebrity in which the winner of each hand throws a glass of water on the loser. After one player uses five glasses, they earn the right to spray his opponent with a large water gun. He has played with Jason Statham, Christopher Meloni, Chris Kattan, Ashton Kutcher, Hugh Jackman, Jon Hamm, Tom Cruise, Ryan Reynolds, and Lindsay Lohan, among others.\n\nJimmy and a male guest each don a suit made of Velcro and throw small red balls at their opponent, trying to get the balls to stick to the suit. After 45 seconds, the balls are tallied and whichever person got more balls on their opponent's suit is declared the winner.\n\nJimmy plays a round of miniature golf in the studio and in the halls around the studio with a celebrity. To date, he has played with Billy Crudup, Will Arnett, Samuel L. Jackson, and Chris Rock.\n\nJimmy and a celebrity guest play an ice-fishing themed game of cornhole with beanbags shaped like fish and an ice-blue target platform. Three points are scored for a bag that goes in the hole, and 1 point for each bag remaining on the board at the end of the game. Each player has 5 bags to throw.\n\n\"*Dawson manually knocked some of her bags into the hole after the game, achieving a posted score of 16.\"\n<br>\"**Moretz walked over to the platform and dropped her last bag directly into the hole.\"\n\nJimmy and Kid Rock played a game of horseshoes. Tariq served as judge. Later, Jimmy played Tim McGraw, with Higgins as judge.\nJimmy and a guest play a game of ladder toss.\nJimmy and a celebrity guest alternate playing simple songs (such as \"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\" or \"Jingle Bells\") on a randomly selected musical instrument that neither have any experience playing, trying to get The Roots to correctly guess what they were trying to play. If there are two celebrity guests, they will compete against each other. Originally, Jimmy and the celebrity would try to guess the songs each other played. The game was introduced to Jimmy by Julianna Margulies, who had played it at a birthday party for William H. Macy. Scarlett Johansson, Carrie Brownstein and Fred Armisen have also played it.\n\nA sketch where Jimmy and a celebrity partner give a \"makeover\" to an audience member. Both Jimmy and the partner dress all in white, including blonde short-bobbed wigs, with Jimmy wearing a peasant shirt and tights. Jimmy sings \"let us play with your look\" over and over, rising in pitch until he gives out, while his partner makes over the audience member. The celebrity is the first guest later, and both Jimmy and the guest usually express wonder at who those two weird people were. \n\nJimmy shows a scene from \"Jacob's Patience\", a fictional 1990s Canadian soap opera he and his celebrity guest appeared on, where the actors used mannequin arms instead of their own. \n\nJimmy plays a clip from \"Other Voices\", a Canadian talk show airing at 3 AM he hosted, which featured his celebrity guest. Their dialogue is supplied off-screen and they must attempt to lip-sync along to it. The first installment featured Jimmy interviewing Steve Carell; Jimmy's dialogue was supplied by Higgins and Carell's was supplied by Chris Kattan. Later, when Jimmy interviewed Simon Cowell and Queen Latifah, Higgins and A. D. Miles supplied the dialogue. When Drew Carey appeared as a guest, in addition to Higgins and Miles providing their voices, Jimmy and Drew had people hiding behind them providing their arms. These are both sketches from \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\", the American version of which Carey hosted.\n\nJimmy and a female guest (or a male in drag) star in a fictional TeenNick show called \"Ew!\", shot in the basement of Sara's house, where two teenage girls talk about things that make them say \"Ew!\". Jimmy plays Sara (\"And if you're wondering, that's S-A-R-A, with no H, because H's are ew!\"). Her nerdy stepdad Gary (played by A. D. Miles), whom she hates and is embarrassed by, always interrupts midway through the show.\n\nThe character of Sara is based on an actual girl named Sara in Jimmy's audience who loudly said \"Ew!\" after a disgusting joke during the July 15, 2011, edition of \"Thank-You Notes\". When Jimmy asked the girl her name, she answered, \"Sara without an H.\"\n\nJimmy saying Ew! in the style of Sara whenever something disgusting is mentioned during the regular show has also become a running gag.\n\nIn chronological order, the show has featured the following celebrities as Sara's friends for guests:\n\nAs part of the pre-show video guests watch prior to riding Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, Jimmy appears as his real self introducing the ride's theme and safety procedures (which Tariq of the Roots raps to), only to discover Sara and Gary in the audience. When Sara interrupts Jimmy telling him to get the ride started, she introduces herself and Gary, using her catchphrase. Jimmy comments that they aren't supposed to be there yet because the rest of the audience is still outside. Sara then remarks, \"Ew! Let's get out of here! Gary, take me to the gift shop!\", and the pair leave.\n\nOn May 10, 2012, Will Ferrell hosted. He emerged from the curtains dancing and singing about his white \"tight pants\". In this sketch that was the most popular among fans, \"All of a sudden, Fallon crashed the party with his own tight pants, which did not sit well with Ferrell — who claimed he was the only one who could wear tight pants.\" The skit was re-run on Fallon's \"Best of Late Night\" special (2014). Later, on Fallon's Tonight Show, he revived the sketch with Jennifer Lopez. In 2016, it was reprised with Will Ferrell and Christina Aguilera.\n\nIn all renditions, Fallon always leaves and says he'll find a new town.\n\nWhenever Gwyneth Paltrow is on, Jimmy mentions they were in a singing duo named Shazazz several years ago (either in the late 1980s or early 1990s). They go on to perform their top hits, originally in the style of old school rap: \"Do It\", \"We're Gonna Do It\", and \"Remember When We Did It (The Reunion)\". A later version had them switching genres to R&B and performing \"Let's Do It\", \"Why Don't We Do It Again\", and \"We Did It\".\n\nJimmy reminisced with Liv Tyler about the time they appeared on \"Star Search\" in the 80s as the duo \"Pleather and Lace\", singing a cover of Cyndi Lauper's \"All Through the Night\". (The Star Search judges gave them ¼ stars.)\n\nLater, the duo appeared on the (fictional) talent search show \"Star Makerz\" singing The Human League's \"Don't You Want Me\". The Star Makerz judges gave them ¼ Zs.\n\nAfter showing a brief clip of the original black-and-white \"Password\" from the 1960s (originally hosted by Allen Ludden, Betty White's husband), Jimmy played Betty (along with two audience members) in a game of \"Password\" hosted by Higgins on a recreation of the original \"Password\" set. Jimmy later teamed up with Robert De Niro to play against Bradley Cooper and an audience member.\n\nSeveral more games of \"Password\" have occurred since then.\n\nHiggins emcees a version of the classic game show \"Pyramid\" where Jimmy and a celebrity guest each pair with an audience member.\n\nJimmy and a celebrity guest each pair with an audience member and play a game of Catch Phrase. The first pair to two points wins.\n\nWhenever she is a guest on the show, Rachel Maddow, a self-proclaimed mixologist, makes Jimmy an obscure cocktail.\n\nWhen he is a guest on the show, Denis Leary and Jimmy will usually play each other in a hockey-themed game, such as air hockey or \"box hockey\". They usually make a bet that the loser will donate money to the Cam Neely House for cancer patients in Boston.\n\nJimmy and a celebrity guest take turns rolling large, soft balls up a ramp into the audience, where audience members are holding bins and buckets labeled with different point values in a layout reminiscent of that used in a regular skee ball game.\n\nJimmy and a celebrity guest attempt to pour three bottles of beer, one at a time, first into a mug and then from the mug into a large graduated cylinder. The pouring is complicated by a broomstick, both ends of which is affixed to their wrists, so that their arms are completely outstretched when attempting the pour from the bottle to the mug. The person with the most liquid in the cylinder at the end of the game wins.\n\nJimmy and a celebrity guest each wear a clear plastic box around the upper half of their bodies. The box is divided into three zones: head, torso, and groin. Both of them are armed with a Nerf-style bow and suction-cup arrows. They stand approximately 15 feet apart and try to hit each other with the arrows. Five points are awarded for an arrow to the torso, ten for a head shot, and twenty for a hit in the groin area.\nJimmy and a celebrity guest each hit large foam balls off a tee into the audience using a large plastic bat. The audience is divided into three scoring zones. Each player hits three balls (and sometimes also a final \"superball\" worth double points). Where the ball lands in the audience is how much it's worth. When playing against a British guest, they use cricket bats instead.\n\nJimmy and a celebrity guest each put their arms and head through holes in stand-up pictures of chefs. In front of them is a pie-flinging machine. They then play rounds of rock-paper-scissors. Each time one of them loses a round, they click their machine one time. After a random number of clicks, the machine will propel the pie into their face (similar in concept to Russian roulette). The first person to take three (later reduced to two) pies to the face loses. One such guest was Glenn Close on June 5, 2013.\n\nJimmy and a celebrity guest appear as disembodied heads in front of a tranquil background and recite not-quite-true facts like \"George Washington's face appears on the quarter, the one-dollar bill, and Tobey Maguire's left butt cheek\" while new age music plays in the background.\n\nJimmy and a celebrity guest take turns selecting an egg from a carton where 8 of the eggs have been hard-boiled and 4 have been left raw. While Jimmy and his guest sit on stools at a small, high table, Steve Higgins presents the egg carton with humorous but ominous remarks while explaining the rules. The contestants then take turns in choosing an egg from the carton and smash it against his forehead. The first person to smash two raw eggs on his head is the loser.\n\nGuest players have included Jason Sudeikis (November 2012), David Duchovny (January 2013), Joel McHale (February 2013), Tom Cruise (April 2013), Seth Meyers (August 2013), and Edward Norton (October 2013).\n\nIn Word Sneak, Jimmy & the celebrity guest hold 5 cards, each containing random words that must be said in a conversation as seamlessly & casually as possible. Guests that have played include Bryan Cranston and Ricky Gervais.\n\nOnce a year on the show, Jimmy has a \"yacht rock\" party, celebrating that genre of soft rock of the late 70s and early 80s. Jimmy will wear a captain's hat (and give out the hats to the audience) and have nautical-themed games. In addition, a yacht rock act will perform one of their hits of the genre:\n\nWhenever Justin Timberlake appears on the show, he and Jimmy perform a medley of popular hip-hop and rap songs from a 30-year span in (roughly) chronological order. Thus far, they have done six installments.\n\nIn a spoof of \"The Price Is Right\" game Plinko, Jimmy and his celebrity guest drop disks into a Plinko-style pegboard, disks that end up in various liquids that are to be mixed and consumed as cocktails. The board invariably contains gag substances such as pea soup or pickle juice, in addition to alcoholic beverages such as champagne and mixers such as Tang.\n\nA game of Blackjack wherein at the end of each round, the winner slaps the loser across the face with a gigantic prosthetic hand.\n\nA game of pool played on a giant billiard table with bowling balls and no cues. The first person to sink three balls, stripes or solids, wins.\n\nIn this hybrid of beer pong and air hockey, at each end of the table are seven holes with cups full of beer in them. If your opponent succeeds in scoring the puck by sinking it in one of your cups, you must chug, then turn the cup upside down and place it on top of the hole. First player to score three wins.\n\nA game of flip cup.\n\nCelebrity guests and Fallon take turns to hit the button of impressions generator, it will land on a random celebrity with a random topic. Celebrity guests and Fallon are challenged to do the impression.\n\n\nCelebrity guests and Fallon take turns to hit the button of impressions generator, it will land on a random singer with a random song. Celebrity guests and Fallon are challenged to do the impression.\n\n\nCelebrity guests and Tariq from The Roots take turns hit the button of freestyle generator, it will land on three different topics. Celebrity guests have to do the rap freestyle containing the three random words.\n\n\nIn this sketch, aired on Nov. 22, 2009, guest Blake Lively and Jimmy play each other, reminiscing about their previous Thanksgiving Dinners. It is shown through flashbacks that each Thanksgiving both Blake and Jimmy bring the same food item or dish. Blake, enraged, slaps Jimmy. At the last Thanksgiving shown neither bring out a food dish, however Blake becomes enraged anyway when she and Jimmy break the wishbone from the turkey and he gets the bigger half.\n\nOn Halloween 2011, Jimmy and Heidi Klum bowled two frames apiece using pumpkins of various sizes instead of bowling balls. Klum beat Jimmy 19-18.\n\nAfter Stephen Colbert auctioned off a portrait of himself \"enhanced\" by artists Shepard Fairey and Andres Serrano for the charity DonorsChoose, he declared on his show, \"The Colbert Report\", that his \"BFF for six months,\" Jimmy Fallon, was going to match the auction price, $26,000. On the next night's \"Late Night\", Fallon demurred, saying, \"here's the thing: I never said that.\" Hearing that, Colbert came out on the \"Late Night\" stage and chided him, saying, \"if you can't donate $26,000 of your best friend's money without asking him first, what's the point in being best friends?\" In quasi-retaliation, Fallon announced that if his viewers would donate the $26,000 to DonorsChoose, Colbert would appear with the Roots to sing Rebecca Black's \"Friday\". (Fallon claimed he couldn't match the amount himself due to his money \"being tied up in Soul Patrol Sweatshirts\".) The viewers met the donation goal (as of April 2, 2011, 2,026 donors had pledged $63,902), with NBC Universal also matching the $26,000, and Colbert, along with Fallon, Black Thought, Taylor Hicks, and the New York Knicks City Dancers, performed the song on the April 1, 2011 show. During the performance, Seth Herzog held up a large placard with a QR code on it; the code led to a \"secret\" video where Jimmy thanked his viewers for their donations.\n\nIn a later segment of \"The Colbert Report\", Colbert noticed that NBC used a picture of the \"Friday\" performance in \"Late Night\"s Emmy packet, and pointed out the irony of doing so since Fallon and Colbert would be up for Emmys in the same category. Colbert then did a \"Thank You Note\" to Jimmy for promoting his show. On a later episode of \"Late Night\", Jimmy wanted to remain \"fremmymies\" (a portmanteau of \"friend\" and \"Emmy\") rather than \"emmymies\" and countered with his version of Colbert's \"The Wørd\" (which included \"Who are we kidding – neither of us is gonna beat Jon Stewart\"); the show then went to commercial with the logo \"Late Night with Jimmy Falbert\".\n\nWhen the six months was up, the pair became mortal enemies and went on each other's shows to feud. Anderson Cooper appeared on both sketches (claiming Italian restaurant Sbarro gives out free tickets to both shows when you buy a slice of pizza) asking each host if he could be their new friend, to which both replied \"No, Anderson, it's just too soon!\"\n\nOn December 20, 2012, Jimmy and Higgins did a version of the classic Abbott and Costello bit \"Who's on First?\" with Jimmy in the Bud Abbott role and Higgins in the Lou Costello role. During the bit, Billy Crystal appeared as the first baseman (Who), A. D. Miles was the second baseman (What), and Jerry Seinfeld played the third baseman (I Don't Know).\n\nOn May 24, 2012, Jimmy and Will Smith played their grandfathers, who had a music show on the old NBC Radio Network in the 1920s, and they show some old archived clips of them performing. However, all of the songs they performed were simply crooner-style versions of Smith's old songs, who claims they sound nothing like his music.\n\nJimmy and Bill Hader played a clip from a TV show in the 1980s they starred in together, in which play officers from the Point Pleasant, New Jersey Police Department, who repeatedly spit food on each other. Since then he did the skit again with Jake Gyllenhaal, Alec Baldwin and Kevin James.\n\nJimmy and Bryan Cranston show clips from a soap opera they were in called \"Suspended Suspense\" in which they played brothers fighting over their late father's estate, all while suspended in the air by harnesses.\n\nJimmy and Jennifer Lawrence show clips from instructional dance videos they attempted to sell on an overnight show on QVC.\n\nJimmy was joined by Lionel Richie for a duet of Richie's song \"Hello\", which was also a parody of its music video.\n\nJimmy and Jon Hamm show clips from a soap opera they starred in together called \"In the Dusk of Night\" in which they played business partners fighting about whether or not Hamm's character is having an affair with Jimmy's character's wife. All the while, small animals on remote controlled cars roll onto the set playing loud music. Hamm claimed his outstanding performance was the reason he got the part of Don Draper on \"Mad Men\".\n\nJimmy and Bryan Cranston show clips from an action show they were in together in which they played BASE jumpers who confessed wrongdoings to each other while on a dive.\n\nEach year for March Madness, Jimmy picks an underdog team he thinks will go all the way. So far he is 1–3; his first 3 picks lost in the first round, but his 2013 pick actually made the Final Four.\n\nIn 2009, Jimmy threw all of his support behind the Tennessee-Chattanooga Mocs, who were seeded #16 and played the heavy favorite, #1 seeded Connecticut Huskies in the first round. Jimmy made signs for the audience to hold up, gave them T-shirts, had their pep band play on the show, did a brief history of the school, and did an interview via satellite with Head Coach John Shulman. He also reviewed a list of notable graduates, which includes Dennis Haskins (most known as Mr. Belding from the TV series \"Saved by the Bell\") who made an appearance on stage in support of his alma mater and gave Jimmy a UTC hat. However, the show's support wasn't enough, as the Mocs lost the game 103–47. Coach Shulman and the outgoing senior players attended the March 20th taping of the show as audience members and Jimmy had a brief conversation with the coach during the show.\n\nIn 2010, Jimmy picked the Siena Saints. He said he wanted to pick his hometown school. He once again did a school history and reviewed a list of notable graduates, which also includes his sister Gloria. The Roots then performed a ballad about head coach Fran McCaffery. The #13 seed Saints lost in the first round to the #4 seed Purdue Boilermakers 72–64. As a tribute to the team, Jimmy read off the Siena roster and had the audience twirl Saints T-shirts.\n\nIn 2011, Jimmy picked the #15 seed Long Island-Brooklyn Blackbirds who played the #2 seed North Carolina Tarheels in the first round. To celebrate, Fallon gave the entire audience Long Island-Brooklyn basketball T-shirts. Later, the Roots sang a song about the LIU head coach Jim Ferry, described by Jimmy as \"the sexiest coach in the NCAA\", and then Jimmy gave the entire audience Blackbirds thundersticks. LIU's mascot also appeared during Cell Phone Shootout the day before the first game to give high fives to the audience. Jimmy's pick once again didn't make it past the first round, losing 102–87.\n\n\"Late Night\" was in reruns the week before the tournament in 2012, so no underdog pick was made that year; however, Jimmy did a Pros and Cons sketch about March Madness upon his return.\n\nIn 2013, Jimmy's team was the #4 seed Syracuse Orange, his first pick to have a higher seed than their first-round opponent. Jimmy gave a special shout-out to Syracuse sophomore forward Rakeem Christmas (whom, Jimmy points out, wears number 25 on his jersey). After Syracuse won their first game (81–34 over the #13-seed Montana Grizzlies), Jimmy gave one lucky audience member a bowl of oranges, which he elected to trade for a \"mystery prize\": a sack of oranges. After Syracuse won their second game (66–60 over the #12-seed California Golden Bears) Jimmy gave out another bowl of oranges, which was traded for a citrus juicer. Syracuse's third game was a 61–50 win over the #1-seed Indiana Hoosiers, but fell during a long weekend. After Syracuse won their fourth game (a 55–39 win over the #3-seed Marquette Golden Eagles), Jimmy gave out another bowl of oranges, which were traded for a gift-wrapped bowl of oranges. Jimmy wanted to show a clip from their Elite Eight Victory, but CBS wouldn't allow it, so they re-created one using an Atari 2600 basketball game. Syracuse was finally defeated in the Final Four by Michigan on April 6.\n\nIn 2014-2016, the Puppy Predictors chose the winners.\n\nIn 2017, Jimmy as Shaquille O'Neal did a bracket (or \"Shaq-et\") in during Shaq's fictional podcast named \"The Shaqcast\" in which he picked the winners based on bizarre criteria (i.e. Wisconsin wins because they're the cheese state and he loves cheese) or the better mascot (he chose Gonzaga to win the tournament because Bulldogs are adorable, although his first pick was his alma mater Louisiana State).\n\nAs an April Fool's Day prank in 2009, Yoshi Amao came out and did the entire monologue in Japanese (with subtitles) instead of Jimmy.\n\nIn 2010, most of the band was shown lounging instead of playing the theme song during the introduction (the music was pre-recorded) while keyboardists James Poyser and Kamal Gray had a pretend boxing match.\n\nIn 2011, the band briefly played the theme song intentionally poorly and Questlove's drumming \"stepped on\" Tariq's announcing of the episode number. Shortly thereafter, Questlove announced \"April Fools!\" They finished the theme song as normal.\n\nIn 2012, April 1 fell on a weekend.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2010 midterm elections, Jimmy had five Golden Retriever puppies with human first and last names (Roger Blain, Brian Johnson, Kyle McAdams, Lisa Armstrong, and \"troublemaker\" Gary Frick) act as \"pundits\" to predict the winner of various races by choosing which of two bowls of dog food to eat from (blue for the Democrat and red for the Republican). After he briefly went through the candidates' positions, he released the puppies from a small cage. The puppies selected:\n\nThe puppies correctly called three of the four races, only missing in the Sestak/Toomey race in Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter the election, an \"attack ad\" (\"paid for by cats\") surfaced slamming Gary Frick for his flip-flop in the Cuomo/Paladino race.\n\nIn a final bipartisan effort, he rewarded the puppies for their work by letting them eat out of a single bowl.\n\nJimmy also had the puppies predict the Best Picture winner of the 83rd Academy Awards. They incorrectly predicted \"Toy Story 3\" (\"The King's Speech\" was the actual winner).\n\nJimmy later had the puppies predict the results of the 2011 NFL season. They incorrectly selected the New England Patriots to be the winners of Super Bowl XLVI. The Patriots did make it to the Super Bowl, but lost to the New York Giants by the score of 21-17.\n\nOn the February 24, 2012 episode, Jimmy had the puppies predict the Best Picture winner of the 84th Academy Awards. They incorrectly predicted \"The Tree of Life\" (\"The Artist\" was the actual winner).\n\nThe night before the 2012 U.S. presidential election, Jimmy allowed Gary Frick (whom Jimmy has adopted as his own pet) to select the winner. She (Gary Frick is actually a female dog) incorrectly picked Mitt Romney as the winner (Barack Obama was re-elected).\n\nOn the January 30, 2013 episode, as part of an \"Audience Suggestion Box\" segment, Jimmy had the puppies predict the winner of Super Bowl XLVII. They correctly selected the Baltimore Ravens over the San Francisco 49ers (the final score was 34-31).\n\nOn the February 20, 2013 episode, Jimmy had the puppies predict the Best Picture winner of the 85th Academy Awards. They correctly predicted \"Argo.\" (Gary Frick did not appear in this segment; she was replaced by Barry Frick, whose relation to Gary, if any, is not yet known.)\n\nOn April 12, 2013 a puppy incorrectly picked Wichita State to win the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament (even though the show's pick was Syracuse, who also didn't win—that honor went to Louisville). The selection method was different for this prediction: each of the four puppies wore the jersey of a different team and the first one that reached the food bowl indicated the prediction.\n\nOn May 3, 2013, Jimmy had one puppy (Barry Frick) predict the winner of the 2013 Kentucky Derby. Barry incorrectly predicted Verrazano, who came in 14th place; Orb was the winner.\n\nOn September 4, 2013, as part of an \"Audience Suggestion Box\" segment, Jimmy had the puppies predict the winner of the NFL season opener between the Baltimore Ravens and the Denver Broncos. They predicted Denver. The puppies were correct when the Broncos, led by Peyton Manning, did win.\n\nOn April 30, 2015, as part of an \"Audience Suggestion Box\" segment, Jimmy had 16 puppies predict the winner of the 2015 Kentucky Derby, all of them representing one of the top sixteen horses racing. The puppies correctly predicted that American Pharaoh would win the derby.\n\nJimmy brought down two self-professed fans of the \"Harry Potter\" series and had them compete at a series of contests to try to win a prize package provided by Warner Brothers.\n\n\nBecause the contestants were tied after round 3, they went to a tiebreaker, where they had to chug a pint of butterbeer as quickly as possible.\n\nThe winner's prize was a three-day trip for two to London, staying at a four-star hotel, and the winner would film a \"Harry Potter\" movie scene. The loser received a \"Late Night\" T-shirt.\n\nJimmy and a choir of the show's staff sang a song about the twelve biggest news stories of 2010, to the tune of \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\". The sketch returned in 2011 as the \"\"Late Night\" Topical Carolers\".\n\nIn \"Target Demographic\", Jimmy details a very specific type of viewer which is attractive to advertisers due to their excessive wasteful spending on material goods. The first version was \"Blonde Connecticut Housewives\". The segment has also examined \"Jersey Shore D-Bags\" (actual residents of the area, not cast members of the MTV reality show), \"Indian Doctors\", and \"Balds\". This sketch was only done in the early days of the show and has seemed to be retired.\n\nLeading up to the 2011 BCS National Championship Game between the Auburn Tigers and the Oregon Ducks, Jimmy noted that, while most schools have school fight songs, no school has a school power ballad. After some deliberation as to which of the championship teams to choose, he decided to create one for Oregon, \"We are the Ducks\", which was performed by former Skid Row lead singer Sebastian Bach.\n\nJimmy and the show's staff, plus Will Arnett and Horatio Sanz, did a parody of \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\" called \"The Pro Bowl Shuffle\".\n\nJimmy played New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, Arnett played Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre, Sanz played Pittsburgh Steelers strong safety Troy Polamalu, Bashir Salahuddin played Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick, and A.D. Miles played New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning. In non-speaking roles, Owen Biddle played Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, Questlove played Detroit Lions tackle Ndamukong Suh, Damon Bryson played Eagles wide receiver DeSean Jackson, Kamal Gray played Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis, with unidentified gentlemen playing Cowboys tight end Jason Witten and Chicago Bears defensive end Julius Peppers.\n\nBlack Thought played Tennessee Titans running back Chris Johnson, Captain Kirk Douglas played Giants wide receiver Steve Smith, F. Knuckles played New Orleans Saints running back Reggie Bush, with an unidentified gentleman playing Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, even though those four players were not named to the 2011 Pro Bowl at the time (Johnson later made the Pro Bowl as a replacement for injured Houston Texans running back Arian Foster).\n\nJimmy enlisted the help of Zac Efron, Jesse Eisenberg, Howie Mandel, Jack McBrayer, Patton Oswalt, Maya Rudolph, Jason Segel, Martin Short, T.I., and Brian Williams to recite a shortened version of the poem \"A Visit From St. Nicholas\" in a Mad Libs fashion.\n\nDuring the week of the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Jimmy opened each show with an impression of a speaker from the previous night at the convention: San Antonio mayor Julian Castro, former president Bill Clinton, and singer James Taylor (singing a parody of \"Fire and Rain\" about the DNC and RNC).\n\nIn a parody of the viral video hit \"The Evolution of Dance\", Jimmy and First Lady Michelle Obama performed \"The Evolution of Mom Dancing\", a series of such dance moves as \"The 'Go Shopping, Get Groceries'\", \"The 'Raise the Roof'\", \"The 'Sprinkler'\", \"The 'Just The Hands Part of Single Ladies'\", \"The 'Where's Your Father? (Get Him Back Here!)'\", \"The 'Pulp Fiction'\", \"The 'Out of Sync Electric Slide'\", and \"The 'Dougie'\". The sketch was in honor of Mrs. Obama's \"Let's Move!\" campaign to end childhood obesity.\n\nLater, Jimmy and Justin Timberlake performed \"The Evolution of End Zone Dancing\", featuring some real touchdown dances like the \"'Ickey Shuffle'\" and \"The 'Dirty Bird'\", as well as other dances, such as \"The 'Touchdown Robot'\", \"The 'Old-Timey Railroad Car'\", \"The 'Earthquake Waiter'\", \"The 'I Thought I Just Saw Aaron Hernandez'\", \"The 'Football Spin' (Into The Love Scene From \"Ghost\")\", and \"The 'Justin Timberlake' (From 'N Sync)\" (the last of which mock-infuriated Timberlake, causing him to shove Jimmy and leave the set).\n\nThen there was an edition which featured Jimmy and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie performing \"The Evolution of Dad Dancing\".\n\nOn February 17, 2014, Fallon teamed up with Will Smith for \"Evolution of Hip Hop Dancing\".\n\n"}

{"id": "56371996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56371996", "title": "Making Samba", "text": "Making Samba\n\nMaking Samba: A New History of Race and Music in Brazil is a book by Marc A. Hertzman published by Duke University Press in 2013. Hertzman's concern with the historical narrative surrounding how Samba became one of Brazil's most valuable cultural staples prompted him to write this book. By tracing the careers of and Gilberto Gil from the late nineteenth century to the 1970s, Hertzman explores various themes such as intellectual property claims, popular music, race, gender, national identity, and the history of Afro-Brazilians in Rio de Janeiro, and how they all contribute to the making of Samba within the Brazilian State.\nHertzman's main argument in this book is that the historical narrative surrounding the emergence of samba in Brazil has either been over-criticized, or exceedingly fetishized. By using wide ranging evidence, such as Brazilian musicians' salary contracts, their involvement and activism with various musical associations, and their encounters with law enforcement, Hertzman explores their struggles in exerting their agency by claiming their music as what he calls, \"intellectual property.\" While Hertzman's book explores different themes such as \"musical blackface\" and \"the purity of samba,\" Hertzman discusses them within the context of Afro-Brazilian figures that were heavily involved with the progress of Samba so that his argument doesn't get off track.\n\n\"Making Samba: A New History of Race and Music in Brazil\" has been highly praised by a variety of historical scholars. Three critical reviews come from Charles A. Perrone in the Luso-Brazilian Review 51 (2014): 209-213. Marshall Eakin in \"Social History\" 39 (2014): 287-289. As well as Paulina Alberto in \"Americas\" 73 (2016): 266-268. All of these scholars agree that Hertzman's work has been a big success in his field and that it \"offers a substantial, indeed superb, contribution to the already robust literature about the birth of samba in the aftermath of slavery in Brazil and its rise to the status of national rhythm by the early twentieth century.\" Perrone adds, \"Even seasoned veterans of this subject will find some edifying surprises.\" \n\nThe Latin American Studies Association awarded \"Making Samba\" Honorable Mention for the 2014 Bryce Wood Book Award.\n"}
{"id": "7809720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7809720", "title": "Mass Appeal (play)", "text": "Mass Appeal (play)\n\nMass Appeal is a two-character play by Bill C. Davis. The comedy-drama focuses on the conflict between a complacent Roman Catholic pastor and the idealistic young deacon who is assigned to his affluent, suburban parish.\n\nFather Tim Farley is highly popular with his parishioners due to his charm, wit, easy-going manner, and entertaining (but unchallenging) sermons. One Sunday, seminarian Mark Dolson interrupts Farley's sermon to challenge his stance on the ordination of women. The pastor is outraged yet intrigued by the young man, and asks to have him assigned to work with him.\n\nDolson is a firebrand eager to change the Church. He enjoys attacking Farley's \"song and dance theology\" and questioning why he drinks so much. Dolson feels it's his job to shake parishioners out of their complacency. Farley likes Dolson, but sees that he'll never succeed as a priest if all he does is irritate people and make enemies. Each man has something to teach the other about how to perform his priestly duties.\n\n\"Mass Appeal\" was first performed in many small theatres, including The No Smoking Playhouse in Manhattan, produced by Pearl Tisman Minsky and Ken Berman, with Berman playing the role of Farley and Bill Davis playing the role of Dolson. At the suggestion of the pastor of The Actors' Church, Minsky brought the play to Geraldine Fitzgerald, with whom she was acquainted. When Fitzgerald agreed to direct the play, she took it to Circle In The Square Theatre in Greenwich Theatre who agreed to workshop it. After the workshop, Circle In The Square did not pursue the play. Geraldine Fitzgerald continued to develop the script with Davis making extensive revisions that greatly improved it. Minsky was about to bring the play to Lynn Meadows at the Manhattan Theatre Club. Fitzgerald suggested that she would bring the play to her as she was better acquainted with her where it was produced to great acclaim. Minsky and Berman met with other producers and put together a package for Broadway. At that point, Davis and Fitzgerald dropped Minsky and Berman, and had the play produced on Broadway. The Broadway playbill for \"Mass Appeal\" notes that the play was produced by arrangement with Minsky and Berman. \nThe play originally was produced by the Manhattan Theatre Club. Directed by Geraldine Fitzgerald and starring Milo O'Shea as Tim Farley and Eric Roberts as Mark Dolson, it opened at the Off-Broadway Stage 73 on April 22, 1980 and ran for 104 performances. Fitzgerald won the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding New Director.\n\nThe Broadway production, again directed by Fitzgerald and starring O'Shea as Tim Farley but with Michael O'Keefe as Mark Dolson, opened at the Booth Theatre on November 12, 1981 after 16 previews. It closed on May 16, 1982 after 212 performances.\n\nThe play premiered in the United Kingdom at the Lyric Hammersmith in London in 1982 with Gordon Jackson as Father Farley and Rupert Everett as Mark Dolson. It received its first British revival at the Finborough Theatre in London in 2006 with Kevin Colson and Brendan Patricks.\n\nIn 1982 the play was performed at Sydney's Seymour Centre theatre, and starred real-life father and son actors Michael and Christopher Pate. Actor/Director Will Stutts toured the United States as Farley in the mid 1980s.\n\nMichael and Christopher Pate, toured Australia. Returning to the Sydney Opera House.\n\nDavis adapted his play for a 1984 feature film starring Jack Lemmon as Tim Farley and Željko Ivanek as Mark Dolson.\n\n"}
{"id": "231715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231715", "title": "Melisma", "text": "Melisma\n\nMelisma (Greek: , \"melisma\", song, air, melody; from , \"melos\", song, melody, plural: \"melismata\") is the singing of a single syllable of text while moving between several different notes in succession. Music sung in this style is referred to as \"melismatic\", as opposed to \"syllabic\", in which each syllable of text is matched to a single note.\n\nMusic of ancient cultures used melismatic techniques to induce a hypnotic trance in the listener, useful for early mystical initiation rites (such as Eleusinian Mysteries) and religious worship. This quality is still found in Arabic music where the scale consists of \"quarter tones\". Orthodox Christian chanting also bears a slight resemblance to this. Middle Eastern melismatic music was developed further in the Torah chanting, as well as by the Masoretes in the seventh or eighth centuries. It then appeared in some genres of Gregorian chant, where it was used in certain sections of the Mass, with the earliest written appearance around AD 900. The gradual and the alleluia, in particular, were characteristically melismatic, for example, while the tract is not, and repetitive melodic patterns were deliberately avoided in the style. The Byzantine Rite also used melismatic elements in its music, which developed roughly concurrently with the Gregorian chant.\n\nIn Western music, the term \"melisma\" most commonly refers to Gregorian chant (the first definition of melisma by the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary' is \"a group of notes or tones sung on one syllable in plainsong\"). However, the term melisma may be used to describe music of any genre, including baroque singing and later gospel. Within Jewish liturgical tradition, melisma is still commonly used in the chanting of Torah, readings from the Prophets, and in the body of a service. For an examination of the evolution of this tradition, see Idelsohn.\n\nToday, melisma is commonly used in Middle Eastern, African, Balkan, and African American music, Fado (Portuguese), Flamenco (Spanish), and various Asian folk and popular musical genres. Melisma is also commonly featured in Western popular music. Early in their careers, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, and Stevie Wonder used it sparingly. Melisma is used by countless pop artists such as Michael Jackson, although this form usually involves improvising melismata (and melismatic vocalise) over a simpler melody. During the fadeout of the Beatles' 1966 track \"I Want to Tell You\", bassist Paul McCartney can be heard singing a high-pitched melisma in the style of classical Indian music.\n\nThe use of melisma is a common feature of artists such as Deniece Williams, Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Beyoncé, Christina Aguilera, among others. The use of melismatic vocals in pop music slowly grew in the 1980s. Deniece Williams topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart in May 1984, with Let's Hear It for the Boy with her melismatic vocals. Although other artists used melisma before, Houston, her rendition of Dolly Parton's love song \"I Will Always Love You\" pushed the technique into the mainstream in the '90s. The trend in R&B singers is considered to have been popularized by Mariah Carey's song \"Vision of Love\", which was released and topped the charts at number one in 1990, and went on to be certified gold.\n\nAs late as 2007, melismatic singers such as Leona Lewis were still scoring big hits, but around 2008–2009, this trend reverted to how it was prior to Carey and Houston's success – singers with less showy styles such as Kesha and Cheryl Cole began to outsell new releases by Carey and Christina Aguilera, ending nearly two decades of the style's dominance of pop-music vocals.\n\nThe French carol tune \"Gloria\" arranged by Edward Shippen Barnes in 1937, to which the hymn \"Angels We Have Heard on High\" is usually sung, contains one of the most melismatic sequences in popular Christian hymn music, on the \"o\" of the word \"Gloria\", which is held through 16 different notes. \"Ding Dong Merrily on High\", arranged by George Ratcliffe Woodward, contains an even longer melisma of 31 notes, also on the \"o\" of \"Gloria\".\n\nGeorge Frideric Handel's \"Messiah\" contains numerous examples of melisma, as in the following excerpt from the chorus \"For Unto Us a Child Is Born\" (Part I, No. 12). The soprano and alto lines engage in a 57-note melisma on the word \"born\".\n\nMelisma is also used, though rarely and briefly, in the music of Jethro Tull: examples include the eponymous track of the album \"Songs From the Wood\" and the song \"Skating Away (On the Thin Ice of the New Day)\".

The NFPB, established by the National Film Preservation Act of 1988, was reauthorized by acts of Congress in 1992, 1996, 2005, and again in October 2008. The NFPB's mission, to which the NFR contributes, is to ensure the survival, conservation, and increased public availability of America's film heritage. The 1996 law also created the non-profit National Film Preservation Foundation which, although affiliated with the NFPB, raises money from the private sector.\n\nThe NFPB adds to the NFR up to 25 \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant films\" each year, showcasing the range and diversity of American film heritage to increase awareness for its preservation. A film becomes eligible for inclusion ten years after its original release. For the first selection in 1989, the public nominated almost 1,000 films for consideration. Members of the NFPB then developed individual ballots of possible films for inclusion. The ballots were tabulated into a list of 25 films which was then modified by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington and his staff at the Library for the final selection. Since 1997, members of the public have been able to nominate up to 50 films a year for the NFPB and Librarian to consider.\nThe NFR includes films ranging from Hollywood classics to orphan films. A film is not required to be feature-length, nor is it required to have been theatrically released in the traditional sense. In addition, television programs, commercials, and foreign films are not excluded from consideration, although American films are given preference. The Registry contains newsreels, silent films, student films, experimental films, short films, music videos, films out of copyright protection or in the public domain, film serials, home movies, documentaries, animation and independent films. As of the 2017 listing, there are 725 films in the Registry.\n\nCurrently, the earliest listed film is \"Newark Athlete\" (1891), and the most recent is \"13 Lakes\" (2004). Counting the 11 multi-year serials in the NFR once each (as the NFR does) by year of completion, the year with the most films selected is 1939, with 19 films from that year chosen. The time between a film's debut and its selection varies greatly. The longest span is 121 years; \"Edison Kinetographic Record of a Sneeze\" was originally released in 1894 and selected in 2015. The shortest span is the minimum 10 years; this distinction is shared by \"Raging Bull\", \"Do the Right Thing\", \"Goodfellas\", \"Toy Story\", \"Fargo\" and \"13 Lakes\".\n\nThis table is through the 2018 induction list (727 films total). For purposes of this list, multi-year serials are counted only once (as they are in the Registry) by year of completion.\n\n"}

It is one of the components of the Peruvian Instituto Nacional de Cultura. As of 2007, the orchestra had ninety members. Besides the traditional classical repertory, the orchestra also performs Latin American and Peruvian works, including numerous world premieres.\n\nBefore the formation of the National Symphony Orchestra, there was an amateur symphony orchestra, founded in 1907 under the auspices of the Lima Philharmonic Society (Sociedad Filarmónica de Lima). The National Symphony Orchestra was founded during the administration of Óscar R. Benavides by law of 11 August 1938. It initially consisted of sixty-four musicians, half of them native Peruvians, the other half foreigners then living in Peru or hired by contract from abroad. The orchestra gave its first concert on 11 December 1938 at the Teatro Municipal de Lima, under the baton of Theo Buchwald, as part of the eighth International Conference of American States. The program featured the National Anthem of Peru, plus works by Beethoven, Debussy, Manuel de Falla, Ravel, and Wagner.\n\nThe first director of the orchestra was the viennese conductor Theo Buchwald, who remained in that position until his death in 1960. This epoch of the orchestra's existence is considered its most brilliant period, since the orchestra had among her members many talented musicians who had come from Europe to Peru when fleeing the Second World War, among them many Jews . Visiting conductors who led the orchestra included Fritz Busch, Carlos Chávez, Aaron Copland, Antal Doráti, Erich Kleiber, Igor Markevitch, Malcolm Sargent, Hermann Scherchen, and Igor Stravinsky. Visiting soloists who performed with the orchestra included Claudio Arrau, Yehudi Menuhin, Artur Rubinstein, Andrés Segovia and Nicanor Zabaleta. A period of decline began in the 1960s, due in part to the socio-economic problems of Peru and to government cultural policies. The orchestra is now passing through a period of financial crisis and managerial reorganization that has engendered much controversy, partly over the transfer of the management of the orchestra to the National Association of Musical Performing Arts Organizations (Asociación Nacional de Elencos Musicales). In August 2006, angered that they would not be paid for a performance of Mozart's Requiem with the National Chorus (Peru) (Coro Nacional), the union of musicians of the orchestra refused to play, and a substitute orchestra was hurriedly assembled instead.\n\nThe orchestra has long promoted the work of Peruvian composers, and it has performed works by Daniel Alomía Robles, Celso Garrido-Lecca, Roberto Carpio, Enrique Iturriaga, Armando Guevara Ochoa, Ernesto López Mindreau, Enrique Pinilla, Francisco Pulgar Vidal, Alfonso de Silva, Teodoro Valcárcel and Edgar Valcárcel, among others.\n\nThe orchestra's home for many years was the Teatro Municipal de Lima. The orchestra currently performs at the Gran Teatro Nacional, but it also gives educational concerts elsewhere in Lima and throughout Peru.\n\n\n\n"}

The band counts 14 percussionists, 5 saxophonist, 3 trumpeters, 3 trombonists, one tuba player and a double-bass player, with several pianists. The term \"invisibile\" (invisible) refers to a feature of the group: the need to restrain the \"visibility\" of the musicians, to minimize distress for the more sensitive components, which could find the presence of an audience difficult to tolerate. Nevertheless, the \"Orchestra Invisibile\" appeared in public and performed live in theatres (Torino, Pavia, and Tortona, and Viterbo. Yet, the communicative exchanges within the band are mainly non-verbal. The majority of the \"Orchestra Invisibile\"'s repertoire is jazz mainstream. The experience has shown how this musical genre could be a good compromise between the consistency of the harmonic structures and the changes deriving from the improvisation and the spirit of freedom, characteristic features of jazz. This can be heard in their first album Orchestra Invisibile, live 2012, published by the independent label Etichette Invisibili. This would sound like an off-key and uncoordinated group in the beginning that gradually harmonizes and synchronizes reaching a pleasant ensemble towards the end. The only way to assist the rehearsals is to actively participate by playing. This aspect has promoted the collaboration with famous musicians as Ellade Bandini (drummers for Paolo Conte, Fabrizio De André, Francesco Guccini, Mina and many more), Jorge Alberto Guerrero and Claudio Perelli.\nAnother critical feature of the band is the circular setting, both during rehearsals and live concerts, alternating melodic and rhythmic instruments, consistently with the sameness during the weekly rehearsals and the performance on stage. This disposition aims at improving the communication within the band, facilitating the visual contact. From the talent of Simona Concaro, and thanks to the contribution of the international musician Hanna Shybayeva, the album Playing with Autism 1.0 (Etichette Invisibili, INVI1301) and the book Playing with Autism 1.1 - Encountering Simona Concaro by Her Music (PUP 2014) have recently been published. Simona Concaro's executions have further been recorded in Playing with Autism 2.0 (Etichette Invisibili, INVI1401).\nIn 2015 it was published the photographic book Orchestra Invisibile (Jaca Book 2015). Celebrating the ten years of activity, the Orchestra Invisibile performed two live concerts at the Teatro Municipale of Casale Monferrato (AL, Italy) and at the Auditorium of the Istituto Vittadini of Pavia (Italy). Furthermore, Edizioni Cardano of Pavia published the book Ritratti Invisibili as a gift for the percussionists of the band.\nIn 2016 the Orchestra Invisibile took part at the Caffeina Festival in Viterbo, gaining the favour of both audience and critics. In 2017, in the context of the World Autism Awareness Day, the Orchestra played at the auditorium Tiziano Zalli of the Banca Popolare di Lodi, designed by Renzo Piano. The performance has been recorded and published in Orchestra Invisibile Live 2017 (Etichette Invisibili, INVI1701) along with a videoclip about the Orchestra Invisibile directed by Giorgia Soi with the contribution of Rossana De Michele.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The event was in commemoration of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II held over the Golden Jubilee Weekend 1–4 June 2002. The event itself was hosted at Buckingham Palace Garden on 3 June 2002. It was the pop/rock equivalent of the Prom at the Palace, that showcased classical music.\n\nThe concert was held at the gardens of Buckingham Palace Garden as part of the Golden Jubilee. The event was touted as the greatest concert in Britain since Live Aid or possibly ever. Tickets to the event were determined by a lottery. 12,000 people attended the concert. An estimated 1 million people watched outside the Palace in The Mall and around the Queen Victoria Memorial, and 200 million on television. The concert included performances of many hit songs from the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. The event was the culmination of a national day of partying. The BBC Music Live Festival also occurred on the day. At 13:00 towns across the United Kingdom had bands play The Beatles hit \"All You Need Is Love\" before church bells were rung around the country.\n\nAmongst others, performers included:\n\nPaul McCartney, Bryan Adams, Queen, Elton John, Shirley Bassey, Eric Clapton, Joe Cocker, Phil Collins, Ray Davies, Dame Edna Everage, Tony Iommi, Tom Jones, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Annie Lennox, S Club 7, Ricky Martin, Ozzy Osbourne, Rod Stewart, Tony Bennett, Blue, Emma Bunton, Atomic Kitten, Mis-Teeq, The Corrs, Cliff Richard, Will Young, Ruby Wax, Steve Winwood and Brian Wilson.\n\nAlso performing was the London cast of the musical \"We Will Rock You\". Several newspapers mentioned the absence of The Rolling Stones. The Stones said the event conflicted with their upcoming world tour.\n\nThe house band for the performance consisted of Phil Palmer (guitar), Pino Palladino (bass), Paul Wickens (keyboards), Phil Collins (drums), Ray Cooper (percussion), Eric Robinson (saxophone), Sam Brown, Margo Buchanan and Claudia Fontaine (backing vocals) and the Royal Academy of Music Symphony Orchestra conducted by Michael Kamen. Some performers brought their own musicians to the concert.\n\nThe concert was hosted by Lenny Henry and Ben Elton. Between some acts were short comedy segments featuring Meera Syal, Nina Wadia, Ruby Wax, Kermit the Frog (voiced by Steve Whitmire), and Barry Humphries (in characters as Dame Edna Everage and Sir Les Patterson).\n\nThe concert began with Brian May performing God Save the Queen on the roof of Buckingham Palace as a guitar solo with support from the orchestra onstage in the Garden far below. This sequence was spectacularly filmed, including some upward photography of May in full \"rock god\" mode and shots of the crowd in the Garden below. It has become an iconic moment and Brian May himself has said in interview that he hoped that he would strike the last chord at the same time as the orchestra in the gardens far below. Once it was finished, said May, the arm and fist went up, and the guitar was free, for it had done its work. Ozzy Osbourne recently said in the same interview that this was the greatest moment of his career and pronounced the Queen to be \"a beautiful woman.\"\n\nPhil Collins played drums for many of the artists, as well as singing his 1983 UK number one single \"You Can't Hurry Love\", with Queen's Roger Taylor playing drums. Taylor took late singer Freddie Mercury's place by singing lead vocals for the band's 1984 number two hit \"Radio Ga Ga\" (which Taylor had also written), with Collins playing drums in place of Taylor.\n\nS Club 7's performance of \"Don't Stop Movin'\" was announced as the last time the group would be performing as a septet, as Paul Cattermole had announced his departure from the group prior to the event.\n\nThe event ended with the Royal Family joining the stars onstage. Prince Charles thanked his mother for her fifty years on the throne, famously beginning his speech with the words, \"Your Majesty...MUMMY!\" to the delight of the crowd and bemusement of the Queen.\n\nFollowing this the Queen and Prince Philip went to light the National Beacon on the Mall. After the lighting of the beacon the largest fireworks show in the history of London took place. During this time different symbols were projected onto the palace including a Union Flag.\n\nA DVD has been issued of the performance. Some portions have been cut, e.g. Ruby Wax's monologue, Dame Edna's introduction of Paul McCartney performing \"Blackbird\" and Paul McCartney's spontaneous performance of \"Her Majesty\".\n\nA live CD recording of the performance was also released in 2002.\n\n"}

The first is one of the plays in the \"Fleury Playbook\", a 13th-century manuscript containing ten liturgical dramas; the text is by Hilarius, and no music accompanies it. The play itself dates from c. 1140. The second is a 13th-century drama with monophonic music, written about 1227 to 1234 by students at the school of Beauvais Cathedral, located in northern France. A large portion of the text is poetic rather than strictly liturgical in origin; it closely follows the narrative of the biblical story of Daniel at the court of Belshazzar.\n\nIn the US the latter play was revived in the 1950s by Noah Greenberg, director of the New York Pro Musica; a commentary in English, written and performed by W. H. Auden, was used in some of their performances. A recorded 1958 performance by the group at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and featuring boy choristers of the Church of the Transfiguration as satraps and soldiers, was released by Decca, with sleeve notes by Paul Henry Lang and Dom Rembert Weakland, O.S.B., who had discovered the text at the British Library. Since the New York Pro Musica production it has enjoyed many performances among early music troupes. Also important in the history of modern revivals of the Beauvais Cathedral version, \"Daniel\" was the 1985 production of the Boston Camerata, staged by Andrea von Ramm, with musical direction by Joel Cohen. In 2008, The Dufay Collective and William Lyons released their CD, \"The Play of Daniel\" on the Harmonia Mundi usa label. A new production of the \"Play of Daniel\" by the Boston Camerata, this time under the direction of French-born medievalist Anne Azéma, was presented in Boston in November, 2014. Daniel was played by tenor Jordan Weatherston Pitts. \n\nIn 2008, a new production, staged by Drew Minter with musical direction by Mary Anne Ballard in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the noted Cloisters production of 1958, was created, also at the Cloisters. The show has been reprised in subsequent seasons, in 2012 at the Cloisters and in 2013 and 2014 as part of the Twelfth Night Festival at Trinity Church Wall Street.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "49968138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49968138", "title": "Screenplay for Citizen Kane", "text": "Screenplay for Citizen Kane\n\nThe authorship of the screenplay for \"Citizen Kane\", the 1941 American motion picture that marked the feature film debut of Orson Welles, has been one of the film's long-standing controversies. With a story spanning 60 years, the quasi-biographical film examines the life and legacy of Charles Foster Kane, played by Welles, a fictional character based in part upon the American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst and Chicago tycoons Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick. A rich incorporation of the experiences and knowledge of its authors, the film earned an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) for Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles. \n\nScreenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz was a notorious personality in Hollywood. \"His behavior, public and private, was a scandal,\" wrote John Houseman. \"A neurotic drinker and a compulsive gambler, he was also one of the most intelligent, informed, witty, humane and charming men I have ever known.\" Orson Welles told Peter Bogdanovich that \"Nobody was \"more\" miserable, \"more\" bitter, and \"funnier\" than Mank ... a perfect monument of self-destruction. But, you know, when the bitterness wasn't focused straight at you, he was the best company in the world.\"\n\nWelles admired Mankiewicz, and had met him in New York in 1938 at the time of the Mercury Theatre's Broadway successes. In September 1939 Welles visited Mankiewicz while he was hospitalized in Los Angeles after a car accident, and offered him a job writing scripts for the Mercury Theatre's show on CBS radio, \"The Campbell Playhouse\". \"I felt it would be useless,\" Welles said later, \"because of Mank's general uselessness many times in the studios. But I thought, 'We'll see what he comes up with.'\" Mankiewicz proved very useful, particularly working with Houseman as editor, and wrote five scripts for \"Campbell Playhouse\" shows broadcast between November 12, 1939, and March 17, 1940. Houseman and Welles were partners in the Mercury Theatre, but when Mercury productions moved from New York to California the partnership ended and Houseman became an employee, working primarily as supervising editor on the radio shows. In December 1939, after a violent quarrel with Welles over finances, Houseman resigned and returned to New York. To Welles, his departure was a relief.\n\nIn late December, the executive board of RKO Pictures all but ordered studio chief George Schaefer to stop paying salaries to the Mercury Productions staff until Welles submitted an acceptable script and set a start date for filming. Over the next five weeks Welles spent many long evenings brainstorming plot ideas in the bedroom of the small rented house where Mankiewicz was in traction with his shattered leg. Mankiewicz testified in a court proceeding a few years later that the idea for the film began with a \"March of Time\"-style sequence that set out the life of a particular character whose life would then be the subject of the film. Welles later said the germinal idea was to create a posthumous portrait of a man through many points of view, in the recollections of those who knew him. \"I'd been nursing an old notion,\" Welles told Bogdanovich, \"the idea of telling the same thing several times—and showing exactly the same thing from wholly different points of view. Basically, the idea \"Rashomon\" used later on. Mank liked it, so we started searching for the man it was going to be about. Some big American figure—couldn’t be a politician, because you’d have to pinpoint him. Howard Hughes was the first idea. But we got pretty quickly to the press lords.\"\n\nWelles and Mankiewicz soon settled on the idea of using newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst as their central character. By late January their disagreements over plot details were more frequent and their collaboration less creative. \"That's why I left him on his own, finally,\" Welles said later, \"because we'd started to waste too much time haggling.\" In February 1940, Welles arranged a lunch at New York's 21 Club and persuaded Houseman to return to California. He was hired to supervise Mankiewicz as he put a rough draft on paper.\n\nOn February 19, 1940, Mankiewicz signed a contract with Mercury Productions to work on the screenplay. He would receive $1,000 a week for his work as long as he was not \"incapacitated by illness or any other reasons\", and would be paid a $5,000 bonus on delivery of the script. Mankiewicz was to receive no credit for his work as he was hired as a script doctor; a similar clause was present in the writers' contracts for \"The Campbell Playhouse\". Mankiewicz was advised by his agents, Columbia Management of California, and before he signed the contract it was again made clear that all credit for his work belonged to Welles and the Mercury Theatre, the \"author and creator\". Welles hesitated to officially agree to give Mankiewicz credit. His contract with RKO stated that the film would be produced, directed, performed and written by Welles, and his \"boy wonder\" persona had great publicity value for the studio. Welles's attorney, Arnold Weissberger, did not want to give RKO any cause to break Welles's contract should they wish to promote the film as solely his work. The contract with Mankiewicz left the matter of his receiving credit open; Welles's correspondence with his lawyer indicated that he did not wish to deny credit to Mankiewicz.\n\nAfter he came to agreement with Welles on the story line and character, Mankiewicz was given the job of writing the first draft that Welles could rework. In the last week of February or the first week of March 1940, Mankiewicz retreated to the historic North Verde Ranch on the Mojave River in Victorville, California, to begin working on the script. Welles wanted the work done as inconspicuously as possible, and the ranch offered the additional advantage of prohibiting alcohol. Mankiewicz was accompanied by a nurse, secretary Rita Alexander, Houseman, and a 300-page rough script of the project that Welles had written. The preliminary work consisted of dialogue and some camera instructions. Author Clinton Heylin wrote that Mankiewicz \"… probably believed that Welles had little experience as an original scriptwriter … [and] may even have felt that \"John Citizen, USA\", Welles's working title, was a project he could make his own.\"\n\nMankiewicz and Houseman worked together in seclusion at the ranch for 12 weeks. Houseman was to serve as editor, Carringer noted, \"but part of his job was to ride herd on Mankiewicz, whose drinking habits were legendary and whose screenwriting credentials unfortunately did not include a reputation for seeing things through.\" There was continual communication with Welles, and Houseman often travelled to Los Angeles to confer with him. Welles visited the ranch occasionally to check on their progress and offer direction. With his own secretary, Katherine Trosper, Welles was reworking the draft pages in Hollywood. These pages were given to RKO script supervisor Amalia Kent, who broke the material down in continuity form for the production units. Welles respected her for her service on the unproduced \"Heart of Darkness\" script. Welles came to suspect that Houseman had turned Mankiewicz against him. \"When Mank left for Victorville, we were friends. When he came back, we were enemies,\" Welles told biographer Richard Meryman. \"Mank always needed a villain.\"\n\nFor some time, Mankiewicz had wanted to write a screenplay about a public figure—perhaps a gangster—whose story would be told by the people who knew him. In the mid-1930s Mankiewicz had written the first act of an unproduced play about John Dillinger, titled \"The Tree Will Grow\". \"It was something [Mankiewicz] had been thinking about for years,\" Houseman wrote, “the idea of telling a man’s private life (preferably one that suggested a recognizable American figure), immediately following his death, through the intimate and often incompatible testimony of those who had known him at different times and in different circumstances.”\n\nWelles himself had worked with the concept. As a teenager in 1932 he wrote a play about the life of abolitionist John Brown called \"Marching Song\". Like that of \"Citizen Kane\", the play’s plot is structured around a journalist attempting to understand Brown by interviewing people who knew him and have different perspectives on him. The plot device of the unseen journalist Thompson in \"Citizen Kane\" is also reminiscent of the unseen Marlow in Welles's proposed film \"Heart of Darkness\", in which the narrator and audience share the point of view. \"Orson was from Chicago,\" said the Mercury Theatre's Richard Wilson, \"and I believe he was as much influenced by Samuel Insull and Colonel Robert McCormick as he was by the figure of Hearst.\" Roger Hill, head of the Todd Seminary for Boys and Welles's mentor and lifelong friend, wrote that Welles once told him about a project he was considering: \"He had outlined to me, years earlier, a plan for a stage play based on the life of an American tycoon who would be a composite of Insull, McCormick and Hearst.\" Hill said that even as a boy Welles was interested in the lives of the controversial tycoons: \"He sensed, even then, the theatrical impact that could be gained in assaulting, and possibly toppling, giants,\" wrote Brady.\n\nWelles did not know Hearst, but he knew much about him through drama critic Ashton Stevens. He also said that his father and Hearst knew each other. When Welles arrived in Hollywood in 1939 everyone was talking about Aldous Huxley's new book, \"After Many a Summer Dies a Swan\", a novel that dealt with the film colony and seemed to be a portrait of Hearst. Welles was invited to celebrate Huxley's birthday at a party where the consensus was that the book could never be made into a film due to Hearst's influence. How much Huxley's book influenced Welles's choice of subject is unknown; Brady wrote that \"a more personal coincidence, however, might have helped fuel the idea.\" Welles's first wife Virginia moved to Los Angeles shortly after their divorce, and on May 18, 1940, she married screenwriter Charles Lederer, favorite nephew of Hearst's mistress Marion Davies.\n\nIn his earlier years as a journalist, Mankiewicz sought political reporters who kept him up on gossip about Hearst, and he had even started to write a play about him. Soon after moving to Hollywood in 1926, Mankiewicz met Hearst and Davies through his friendship with Lederer. \"There were two castes in Hollywood,\" wrote Meryman, \"those who had been guests at San Simeon and those who had not.\" Mankiewicz and his wife were part of the social set invited to Hearst Castle on several occasions. They were always given the same apartment in La Casa del Monte guest cottage—\"like a little castle of our own,\" said Sara Mankiewicz. A celebrated wit, Mankiewicz was valued for his conversation and was seated near his hosts at dinner. He respected Hearst's knowledge and was privileged to be invited to his private office where he mingled with Hearst's editors and columnists. \"For the first time Herman's Hollywood pleasure merged with his political scholarship\", wrote Meryman.\n\nDescribed by biographer Simon Callow as \"a keen student of power and its abuses\", Mankiewicz was fascinated by Hearst, and Hearst in turn was interested in the former journalist with so much political knowledge. Mankiewicz and Lederer delighted in concocting facsimile newspapers that needled Hearst and his publications, for the amusement of Hearst and Davies. By 1936, however, Mankiewicz was no longer welcome in Hearst's circle due to his drinking and political arguments. \"Mankiewicz, nursing his resentment, had subsequently become obsessed by both Hearst and Davies,\" Callow wrote, \"collecting stories about them the way small boys collect stamps.\"\n\nDuring March, April and early May 1940, Mankiewicz dictated the screenplay, titled \"American\". Welles re-wrote and revised an incomplete first draft given to him, dated April 16, and sent it back to Victorville. Forty-four revision pages dated April 28 were given to Welles. Mankiewicz and Houseman delivered the second draft, bearing a handwritten date of May 9, to Welles after finishing their work in Victorville. Mankiewicz immediately went to work on another project for MGM, and Houseman left for New York four days later.\n\n\"Despite Houseman's description of himself and Herman paring every excess out of \"American\", it was 325 pages long and outrageously overwritten, even for a first draft,\" wrote Meryman. \"Houseman blandly ignores this fact. He implies that \"American\", with only the conventional amount of polishing, was what was filmed.\" Welles had been editing and rewriting the script pages in Beverly Hills. With the Victorville script now in hand he cut it by some 75 pages, and added or revised more than 170 pages. \"By far the most serious dramatic problem in \"American\" is its treatment of Kane,\" wrote Carringer. The RKO legal department warned Welles that it was too close a portrait of Hearst and that if the script was not changed a suit for libel or invasion of privacy was almost certain.\n\n\"There is a quality in the film—much more than a vague perfume—that was Mank and that I treasured,\" Welles said. \"It was a kind of controlled, cheerful virulence … I personally liked Kane, but I went with that. And that probably gave the picture a certain tension, the fact that one of the authors hated Kane and one loved him. But in his hatred of Hearst, or whoever Kane was, Mank didn't have a clear enough image of who the \"man\" was. Mank saw him simply as an egomaniac monster with all these people around him.\" Mankiewicz had made a study of Hearst over many years, and he had firsthand knowledge as one of his frequent guests at San Simeon; but he also drew on published accounts about Hearst for the script. \"He always denied it,\" wrote Carringer, \"but coincidences between \"American\" and Ferdinand Lundberg's \"Imperial Hearst\" are hard to explain.\" Welles removed a great deal of Mankiewicz's Hearst material, but Lundberg would eventually file suit nevertheless.\n\nThe fourth draft dated June 18 was the first to be titled \"Citizen Kane\". The title was contributed by RKO studio chief George Schaefer, who was concerned that calling the film \"American\" would seem cynical and identify too closely with Hearst, whose newspapers included the \"American Weekly\" and the \"New York Journal-American\". Mankiewicz and Houseman were put back on the Mercury payroll June 18 – July 27, and continued to help revise the script. Dated July 16, 1940, the final shooting script was 156 pages. \"After seven complete revisions, Welles finally had what he wanted,\" wrote Brady. Carringer summarized:\n\nMankiewicz (with assistance from Houseman and with input from Welles) wrote the first two drafts. His principal contributions were the story frame, a cast of characters, various individual scenes, and a good share of the dialogue. … Welles added the narrative brilliance—the visual and verbal wit, the stylistic fluidity, and such stunningly original strokes as the newspaper montages and the breakfast table sequence. He also transformed Kane from a cardboard fictionalization of Hearst into a figure of mystery and epic magnificence. \"Citizen Kane\" is the only major Welles film on which the writing credit is shared. Not coincidentally, it is also the Welles film that has the strongest story, the most fully realized characters, and the most carefully sculpted dialogue. Mankiewicz made the difference.\n\nWelles called Mankiewicz's contribution to the script \"enormous\". He summarized the screenwriting process: \"The initial ideas for this film and its basic structure were the result of direct collaboration between us; after this we separated and there were two screenplays: one written by Mr. Mankiewicz, in Victorville, and the other, in Beverly Hills, by myself. … The final version of the screenplay … was drawn from both sources.\"\n\nIn 1969, when he was interviewed for the official magazine of the Directors Guild of America, Houseman concurred with Welles's description of the scripting process: \"He [Welles] added a great deal of material himself, and later he and Herman had a dreadful row over the screen credit. As far as I could judge, the co-billing was correct. The \"Citizen Kane\" script was the product of both of them.\"\n\nBut at the same time, Houseman was stirring controversy, lunching with film critic Pauline Kael and giving Mankiewicz total credit for the creation of the script for \"Citizen Kane\". Carringer wrote that \"in his lengthy account of the Victorville interlude, Houseman gives the impression that Mankiewicz started out with a clean slate, and that virtually everything in the Victorville drafts is Mankiewicz's original invention.\" Houseman would openly say that Mankiewicz deserved sole credit for writing the film for many years—right up until his death—without explaining the contradictions present even in his own personal papers.\n\nOne of the long-standing controversies about \"Citizen Kane\" has been the authorship of the screenplay. Mankiewicz was enraged when an August 1940 column by Louella Parsons quoted Welles as saying, \" … and so I wrote \"Citizen Kane\".\" When RKO released the film in May 1941, the souvenir program included a double-page spread depicting Welles as \"the four-most personality of motion pictures … author, producer, director, star.\" Mankiewicz wrote his father, \"I'm particularly furious at the incredibly insolent description of how Orson wrote his masterpiece. The fact is that there isn't one single line in the picture that wasn't in writing—writing from and by me—before ever a camera turned.\"\n\nMankiewicz had seen rushes of the film shortly before this and said he was unhappy with the footage. However, Mankiewicz's assessment of the footage was full of contradictions. He told Welles that there were \"not enough standard movie conventions being observed\" and that he disliked the theatricality and lack of close-ups in the film. But Mankiewicz also called the footage \"magnificent\" and said he liked it \"from an ascetical point of view.\" He also said that he thought the audience would not understand the film.\n\nMankiewicz began threatening Welles to get credit for the film. This included threatening to post full-page ads in trade papers and getting his friend Ben Hecht to write an exposé about their collaboration in the \"Saturday Evening Post\". Mankiewicz also threatened to go to the Screen Writers Guild and claim full credit for writing the entire script by himself. Welles biographer Barbara Leaming believes that Mankiewicz reacted this way out of fear of getting no credit at all.\n\nAfter lodging a protest with the Screen Writers Guild, Mankiewicz withdrew it, then vacillated. The question was resolved in January 1941 when RKO awarded Mankiewicz credit. The guild credit form listed Welles first, Mankiewicz second. Welles's assistant Richard Wilson said that the person who circled Mankiewicz's name in pencil, then drew an arrow that put it in first place, was Welles. The official credit reads, \"Screenplay by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles\".\n\nMankiewicz's rancor toward Welles grew over the remaining 12 years of his life. Welles's irritation with Mankiewicz passed quickly, and he spoke of him with fondness.\n\n\"One of the things that bound his friends to him was his extraordinary vulnerability,\" Welles told Mankiewicz's biographer. \"He liked the attention he got as a great, monumental self-destructing machine. That was his role, and he played it to the hilt. He was a performer, as I think all very successful personalities are. He couldn’t be affectionate or loving outside his family. You never felt you were basking in the warmth of his friendship. So it was his vulnerability that brought the warmth out from the friends. And people loved him. \"Loved\" him. That terrible vulnerability. That terrible wreck.\"\n\nWelles further said this to Mankiewicz's biographer: \"I have only one real enemy in my life that I know about, and that is John Houseman. Everything begins and ends with that hostility behind the mandarin benevolence.\"\n\nQuestions over the authorship of the \"Citizen Kane\" screenplay were revived in 1971 by influential film critic Pauline Kael, whose controversial 50,000-word essay \"Raising Kane\" was printed in two consecutive issues of \"The New Yorker\" and subsequently as a long introduction to the shooting script in \"The Citizen Kane Book\". Kael's unacknowledged primary source was Houseman.\n\n\"The major focus of Kael's essay is its defense and celebration of screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz as the principal, neglected creative force behind \"Kane\",\" wrote film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum. \"According to Kael, the script was written almost entirely by Mankiewicz, and Welles had actively plotted to deprive him of any screen credit.\" The mainstream press accepted Kael's flamboyant but unsubstantiated essay—an extension of her dispute with Andrew Sarris and the auteur theory—based on her credibility as one of the country's top film critics.\n\n\"Raising Kane\" angered many critics, most notably Bogdanovich, a close friend of Welles who rebutted Kael's claims in \"The Kane Mutiny\", an October 1972 article for \"Esquire\". The article included the revelation that Kael used the research and interviews of Dr. Howard Suber, an assistant professor at UCLA where she was then a guest lecturer, without ever crediting him.\n\nOther rebuttals included articles by Sarris, Joseph McBride and Rosenbaum, interviews with George Coulouris and Bernard Herrmann that appeared in \"Sight & Sound\", a definitive study of the scripts by Carringer and remarks in Welles biographies by Leaming and Brady. Rosenbaum also reviewed the controversy in his editor's notes to \"This is Orson Welles\" (1992).\n\n\"Orson was vigorously defended,\" wrote biographer Barton Whaley, \"but in less prominently placed articles; so, again, the damage was immense and permanent.\"\n\nBy the time of Kael's death 30 years after its publication, \"Raising Kane\" was discredited.\n\nAny question of authorship was resolved with Carringer's 1978 essay, \"The Scripts of Citizen Kane\". Carringer studied the collection of script records—\"almost a day-to-day record of the history of the scripting\"—that was then still intact at RKO. He reviewed all seven drafts and concluded that \"the full evidence reveals that Welles's contribution to the \"Citizen Kane\" script was not only substantial but definitive.\"\n\nCarringer found that the issues raised by Kael rested on the evidence of an early draft of the screenplay, primarily written by Mankiewicz, which \"elaborated the plot logic and laid down the overall story contours, established the main characters, and provided numerous scenes and lines that would eventually appear in one form or another in the film.\" At that stage of the scripting, Kane was a caricature of Hearst rather than the fully developed character of the final film. Carringer found clues in the second draft that Welles was guiding the script, and in the third draft he documented Welles's direct involvement and responsibility for the first major revisions. \"That the subsequent installments are also attributable chiefly to Welles is indicated both by the circumstances and by the nature of the revisions,\" Carringer wrote.\n\nCarringer observed that \"Citizen Kane\" is one of the few Welles projects based on an original story idea rather than an adaption of existing work. \"Mankiewicz was hired to furnish him with what any good first writer ought to be able to provide in such a case: a solid, durable story structure on which to build,\" Carringer wrote. Welles then \"adapted it with the same freedom and disregard for authority with which he adapt[ed] a Shakespeare play or a thriller by Nicholas Blake.\"\n\nThe screenplay for \"Citizen Kane\" received the Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay), shared by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles.\n"}

It is created and produced by Robert Smigel and J. J. Sedelmaier as part of the \"Saturday TV Funhouse\" series of sketches. It follows the adventures of Ace and Gary, voiced by Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell, respectively, two superheroes whose sexual orientation is a matter of dispute, and a cavalcade of characters preoccupied with the question.\n\n\"The Ambiguously Gay Duo\" is a parody of the stereotypical comic book superhero duo done in the style of Saturday morning cartoons like \"Super Friends\". The characters are clad in matching pastel turquoise tights, dark blue domino masks, and bright yellow coordinated gauntlets, boots and shorts. The shorts were intended to satirize suggestions that early Batman comics implied a homosexual relationship between the eponymous title character and his field partner and protégé Robin, a charge most infamously leveled by Fredric Wertham in his 1954 book, \"Seduction of the Innocent,\" the research methodology for which was later discredited.\n\nThe typical episode usually begins with the duo's arch-nemesis Bighead, a criminal mastermind with an abnormally large cranium. Bighead is usually briefing his henchmen on a plot for some grandiose plan for world domination, interrupted by a debate as to whether or not Ace and Gary (The Ambiguously Gay Duo) are gay. Once the crime is in process, the police commissioner calls on the superheroes to save the day, often engaging in similar debates with the chief of police.\nAce and Gary set out to foil the evil plan, but not before calling attention to themselves with outrageous antics and innuendo, and behaving in ways perceived by other characters to be stereotypically homosexual, as in this conversation from the first episode:\nAce [patting Gary on the buttocks]: Good job, friend-of-friends!\nVillains/Bystanders [gasps, and ghastly stares]\nAce: What's everybody looking at?\nVillains/Bystanders in unison: NOTHING!\nSimilar gags appear in almost every episode.\n\nEpisodes not following this general formula have featured Ace and Gary answering fan mail or offering child safety tips. One such episode entails Ace and Gary giving children a ride home in their Duocar and offering home decorating tips, all while blithely making various suggestive gestures and comments.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2015, Bif Bang Pow Toys produced and released a new 8\" retro action-figure line of Ace and Gary titled the Ambiguously Gay Duo 8\" retro action figure series. They were both individually packaged on a card but sold together in a set at the Entertainment Earth Catalog and website and at other toy and comic book stores as well. That same year, Bif Bang Pow Toys produced the Ambiguously Gay Duo Tin Tote (Lunchbox) action figure set of four 5\" action-figures of Ace, Gary, and Bighead.\n\n"}

The series lasted 17 volumes and was published up until 2005 (covering Crumb's work up to 1992). After this, Crumb's work was to be collected in individually titled collections, and not be part of the official numbered series.\n\nAll volumes have been published at some point in both softcover and hardcover editions. Two box sets have also been produced, collected Volumes #1-5 and #6-10, with a slip case and signed plate, limited to 400 sets each.\n\nThe first two volumes contain material going back as far as Crumb's teenage years, from before he had had his comics professionally published. Some consider this material to be non-essential, and that it would be better for a newcomer to start with later volumes.\n"}
{"id": "791422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=791422", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "text": "The Hollywood Reporter\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter (THR) is a multi-platform American digital and print magazine founded in 1930 and focusing on the Hollywood film industry, television, and entertainment industries, as well as Hollywood's intersection with fashion, finance, law, technology, lifestyle, and politics.\n\nHeadquartered in Los Angeles, \"THR\" is part of the Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group, a group of properties that includes \"Billboard\" and SpinMedia. It is owned by Valence Media, a holding company co-founded by Todd Boehly, an executive of its previous owners, Guggenheim Partners and Eldridge Industries.\n\nUnder Janice Min, a faltering \"THR\" was relaunched in 2010 as a weekly large-format print magazine with a revamped, continuously updated website, as well as mobile and tablet editions.\n\n\"THR\" was founded in 1930 by William R. \"Billy\" Wilkerson (1890–1962) as Hollywood's first daily entertainment trade newspaper. The first edition appeared on September 3, 1930 and featured Wilkerson's front-page \"Tradeviews\" column, which became influential. The newspaper appeared Monday to Saturday for the first 10 years, except for a brief period, then Monday to Friday from 1940. Wilkerson ran the \"THR\" until his death in September 1962, although his final column appeared 18 months prior.\n\nFrom the late 1930s, Wilkerson used \"THR\" to push the view that the industry was a communist stronghold. In particular, he opposed the screenplay writers' trade union, the Screen Writers Guild, which he called the \"Red Beachhead.\" In 1946 the Guild considered creating an American Authors' Authority to hold copyright for writers, instead of ownership passing to the studios. Wilkerson devoted his \"Tradeviews\" column to the issue on July 29, 1946, headlined \"A Vote for Joe Stalin.\" He went to confession before publishing it, knowing the damage it would cause, but was apparently encouraged by the priest to go ahead with it.\n\nThe column contained the first industry names, including Dalton Trumbo and Howard Koch, on what became the Hollywood blacklist, known as \"Billy's list.\" Eight of the 11 people Wilkerson named were among the \"Hollywood Ten\" who were blacklisted after hearings in 1947 by the House Un-American Activities Committee. When Wilkerson died, his \"THR\" obituary said that he had \"named names, pseudonyms and card numbers and was widely credited with being chiefly responsible for preventing communists from becoming entrenched in Hollywood production.\"\n\nIn 1997, \"THR\" reporter David Robb wrote a story about the newspaper's involvement, but the editor, Robert J. Dowling, declined to run it. For the blacklist's 65th anniversary in 2012, the \"THR\" published a lengthy investigative piece about Wilkerson's role, by reporters Gary Baum and Daniel Miller. The same edition carried an apology from Wilkerson's son W. R. Wilkerson III. He wrote that his father had been motivated by revenge for his thwarted ambition to own a studio.\n\nWilkerson's wife, Tichi Wilkerson Kassel (1926–2004), took over as publisher and editor-in-chief when her husband died. She sold the paper on April 11, 1988, to Affiliated Publications, parent company of Billboard Publications, for $26.7 million. Robert J. Dowling became \"THR\" president in 1988 and editor-in-chief and publisher in 1991.\n\nDowling hired Alex Ben Block as editor in 1990, and editorial quality of both news and specials steadily improved. Block and Teri Ritzer dampened much of the rah-rah coverage and cronyism that had infected the paper under Wilkerson. After Block left, former \"Variety\" film editor, Anita Busch, was became editor between 1999 and 2001. Busch was credited with making the paper competitive with \"Variety\". Tony Uphoff assumed the publisher position in November 2005. In March 2006, a private equity consortium led by Blackstone and KKR, both with ties to the conservative movement in the United States, acquired \"The Reporter\" along with the other assets of Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen (VNU) which purchased Affiliated Publications in 1994. It joined those publications with \"AdWeek\" and A.C. Nielsen to form The Nielsen Company.\n\nJohn Kilcullen replaced Uphoff in October 2006, as publisher of \"Billboard\". Kilcullen was a defendant in Billboard's infamous \"dildo\" lawsuit, in which he was accused of race discrimination and sexual harassment. VNU settled the suit on the courthouse steps. Kilcullen \"exited\" Nielsen in February 2008 \"to pursue his passion as an entrepreneur.\" Matthew King, vice president for content and audience, editorial director Howard Burns, and executive editor Peter Pryor left the paper in a wave of layoffs in December 2006; editor Cynthia Littleton, widely respected throughout the industry, reported directly to Kilcullen. \"The Reporter\" absorbed another blow when Littleton left her position for an editorial job at \"Variety\" in March 2007. Web editor Glenn Abel also left after 16 years with the paper.\n\nIn December 2009, Prometheus Global Media, a newly formed company formed by Pluribus Capital Management and Guggenheim Partners and chaired by Jimmy Finkelstein, CEO of News Communications, parent of political journal \"The Hill\", acquired \"The Hollywood Reporter\" from Nielsen Business Media. It pledged to invest in the brand and grow the company. Richard Beckman, formerly of Condé Nast, was appointed the new company's CEO. Since January 2014, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" has been led by co-presidents Janice Min and John Amato.\n\nGuggenheim Partners announced on December 17, 2015 that it would sell the Prometheus media properties to its executive Todd Boehly. The company was sold to Eldridge Industries in February 2017. On February 1, 2018, Eldridge Industries announced the merger of its media properties with Media Rights Capital to form Valence Media.\n\n\"THR\"'s editors have included Janice Min (2010–2017), Elizabeth Guider (2007–2010), Cynthia Littleton (2005–2007), Howard Burns (2001–2006), Anita Busch (1999–2001), and Alex Ben Block (1990–1999).\n\nIn April 2007, industry veteran Eric Mika was named to the newly created role of Senior Vice President, Publishing Director of \"The Reporter\". Having previously served as Senior Vice President and Managing Director of Nielsen Business Media's Film and Performing Arts Group and, before that, as Vice President and Managing Director for \"Variety\", Mika assumed responsibility for the general management of sales, marketing and editorial for \"The Hollywood Reporter\", as well as the brand's ancillary products, events, licensing business and partnerships.\n\nIn June 2007, Rose Einstein, former Vice President, Advertising Sales for Netflix and 25-year veteran of Reed Business Media, was named to the newly created role of Vice President, Associate Publisher to oversee all sales and business development for \"The Reporter\". She left that position in June 2009. Mika left THR in early 2010.\n\nIn July 2007, \"THR\" named Elizabeth Guider as its new editor. An 18-year veteran of \"Variety\", where she served as Executive Editor, Guider assumed responsibility for the editorial vision and strategic direction of \"The Hollywood Reporter\"s daily and weekly editions, digital content offerings and executive conferences. After nearly running the publication into the ground, Guider left \"The Hollywood Reporter\" in early 2010.\n\nIn April 2010, Lori Burgess was named as publisher. Burgess had been publisher of \"OK!\" magazine since October 2008. Michaela Apruzzese was named associate publisher, entertainment in May 2010. Apruzzese previously served as the director of movie advertising for Los Angeles Times Media Group.\n\nIn May 2010, Janice Min was named Editorial Director. In January 2014, she was promoted to President/Chief Creative Officer with additional oversight of THR's sister brand, \"Billboard\". Lynne Segall, former vice president and associate publisher, was named publisher and senior vice president in June 2011.\n\nIn February 2017, Min announced she was stepping down from her role as President/Chief Creative Officer overseeing \"The Hollywood Reporter\" and \"Billboard\" to take on a new role at parent company. Simultaneously, it was announced that longtime executive editor Matthew Belloni would take over as Editorial Director.\n\nThe weekly print edition of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" includes profiles, original photography and interviews with entertainment figures; articles about major upcoming releases and product launches; film reviews and film festival previews; coverage of the latest industry deals, TV ratings, box-office figures and analysis of global entertainment business trends and indicators; photos essays and reports from premieres and other red-carpet events; and the latest on Hollywood fashion and lifestyle.\n\nThe \"Reporter\" published a primitive \"satellite\" digital edition in the late 1980s. It became the first daily entertainment trade paper to start a website in 1995. Initially, the site offered free news briefs with complete coverage firewalled as a premium paid service. In later years, the website became mostly free as it became more reliant on ad sales and less on subscribers. The website had already gone through a redesign by the time competitor \"Variety\" took to the web in 1998. In 2002, the \"Reporter\"s website won the Jesse H. Neal Award for business journalism. In November 2013, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" launched the style site Pret-a-Reporter.\n\nTHR.com, \"The Hollywood Reporter\"s website, re-launched in 2010, offers breaking entertainment news, reviews and blogs; original video content (and film and TV clips) and photo galleries; plus in-depth movie, television, music, awards, style, technology and business coverage. As of August 2013, Comscore measured 12 million unique visitors per month to the site.\n\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\" has a staff of roughly 150. In addition to hiring Eric Mika, Rose Eintstein and Elizabeth Guider, the \"Reporter\" hired the following staff in 2007:\n\n\nHowever, staffing levels began to drop again in 2008. In April, Nielsen Business Media eliminated between 40 and 50 editorial staff positions at \"The Hollywood Reporter\" and its sister publications: \"Adweek\", \"Brandweek\", \"Editor & Publisher\" and \"Mediaweek.\" In December, another 12 editorial positions were cut at the trade paper. In addition, 2008 saw substantial turnover in the online department: THR.com Editor Melissa Grego left her position in July to become executive editor of \"Broadcasting & Cable\", and Managing Editor Scott McKim left to become a new media manager at Knox College. With the entertainment industry as a whole shrinking, \"Hollywood studios have cut more than $20 million from the Motion Picture Association of America budget this year. The resulting staff and program reductions are expected to permanently shrink the scope and size of the six-studio trade and advocacy group.\"\n\nStaffing at \"THR\" in 2008 saw even further cutbacks with \"names from today's tragic bloodletting of \"The Hollywood Reporter\"'s staff\" adding up quickly in the hard economic times at the end of 2008. \"The trade has not only been thin, but only publishing digital version 19 days this holiday season. Film writers Leslie Simmons, Carolyn Giardina, Gregg Goldstein, plus lead TV critic Barry Garron and TV reporter Kimberly Nordyke, also special issues editor Randee Dawn Cohen out of New York and managing editor Harley Lond and international department editor Hy Hollinger, plus Dan Evans, Lesley Goldberg, Michelle Belaski, James Gonzalez were among those chopped from the masthead.\"\n\nWhen Janice Min and Lori Burgess came on board in 2010, the editorial and sales staff increased nearly 50%, respectively. Min hired various recognized journalists in the entertainment industry, most notably \"Variety\" film critic Todd McCarthy after his firing from \"Variety\" in March 2010, as well as Kim Masters of NPR, Tim Goodman of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", Lacey Rose of \"Forbes\", and Pamela McClintock of \"Variety\".\n\nThe 2010 relaunch of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" under then-CEO Richard Beckman was closely chronicled by the national media. After purchasing THR from Guggenheim Partners and Pluribus Capital in 2010, Beckman recruited Min, the former editor-in-chief of Us Weekly, to \"eviscerate\" the existing daily trade paper and reinvent it as a glossy, large-format weekly magazine.\n\n\"The Reporter\" relaunched with a weekly print edition and a revamped website that enabled it to break news. Eight months after its initial report, \"The New York Times\" took note of the many scoops \"THR\" had generated, adding that the new glossy format seemed to be succeeding with its \"rarefied demographic\". \"They managed to change the subject by going weekly… The large photos, lush paper stock and great design are a kind of narcotic here.\"\n\nBy February 2013, the \"Times\" returned to \"THR\", filing a report on a party for Academy Award nominees the magazine had hosted at the Los Angeles restaurant Spago. Noting the crowd of top celebrities in attendance, the \"Times\" alluded to the fact that many Hollywood insiders were now referring to \"THR\" as \"the new \"Vanity Fair\"\". Ad sales since Min's hiring were up more than 50%, while traffic to the magazine's website had grown by 800%.\n\nIn 1932, \"Variety,\" who at the time were only based in New York publishing weekly, sued \"The Hollywood Reporter\" for alleged plagiarism for $46,500 accusing them of copying their reporting by phoning or wiring the information to Hollywood after the publication of \"Variety\" in New York on Tuesdays so that they could publish the information before \"Variety\" reached Hollywood on Fridays.\n\nIn 2011, \"Deadline Hollywood\", a property of Penske Media Corporation, now the owner of \"Variety\", sued \"The Hollywood Reporter\" for more than $5 million, alleging copyright infringement. In 2013, \"THR\"s parent company settled the suit. According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The lawsuit [was] widely viewed in Hollywood as a proxy for the bitter war for readers and advertising dollars... The two sides agreed on a statement reading in part: 'Prometheus admits that \"The Hollywood Reporter\" copied source code from Penske Media Corporation's Web site www.tvline.com; Prometheus and \"The Hollywood Reporter\" have apologized to Penske Media.'\"\n\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\" published out of the same offices on Sunset Boulevard for more than a half century. Today, the offices are located in L.A.'s Mid-Wilshire district.\n\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\" sponsors and hosts a number of major industry events and awards ceremonies. It hosted 13 such events in 2012, including the Women in Entertainment Breakfast, where it announced its annual Power 100 list of the industry's most powerful women; the Key Art Awards (for achievement in entertainment advertising and communications); Power Lawyers Breakfast; Next Gen (honoring the industry's 50 fastest-rising stars and executives age 35 and under); Nominees Night; and the 25 Most Powerful Stylists Luncheon.\n\nEntertainment-industry awards receive ample coverage from \"The Hollywood Reporter\", both in print and online. The magazine handicaps all the races, profiles the contenders and analyzes the business impact of nominations and wins. THR awards analyst Scott Feinberg analyzes and predicts the Emmy and Oscar races (his weekly \"Feinberg Forecast\" is published from late August up to the Academy Awards broadcast). THR also offers special print editions, such as its annual Oscar and Emmy issues, during respective awards seasons. THR.com features The Race, an awards-coverage blog, which encompasses Race to the Oscars, an app dedicated to Academy Awards coverage for iPhone and Android platforms.\n\n\"Variety\" was long established as a weekly entertainment trade paper based in New York City, initially covering vaudeville circles, Tin Pan Alley and in the city's Theater District, but it was \"The Hollywood Reporter\" that began reporting the film business daily from Hollywood in 1930.\n\n\"Variety\" used to take three days to reach Hollywood and sued \"The Hollywood Reporter\" for alleged plagiarism in 1932 by taking advantage of the delay and difference in publication schedules and eventually started its daily Hollywood edition, \"Daily Variety\", in 1933.\n\nFrom 1988 to 2014, \"Variety\" and \"The Hollywood Reporter\" were both located on Wilshire Boulevard along the well-trafficked Miracle Mile. Staffers often migrate between the papers.\n\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\" maintains a business association with the home entertainment trade publication \"Home Media Magazine\", which is owned by Questex Media Group. The alliance includes an exchange of stories when the need arises, and gives \"The Reporter\" access into the home entertainment trade, which \"Variety\" enjoyed with its former sister publication, the Reed-owned \"Video Business.\"\n\nIn March 2007, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" surpassed \"Daily Variety\" to achieve the largest total distribution of any entertainment daily.\n\n"}
{"id": "436574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436574", "title": "The NBC Mystery Movie", "text": "The NBC Mystery Movie\n\nThe NBC Mystery Movie is the umbrella title of an American television series produced by Universal Studios, that was broadcast by NBC from 1971 to 1977. At times, it was divided into two versions that were broadcast concurrently during different nights of the week: \"The NBC Sunday Mystery Movie\" and \"The NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie\".\n\n\"The NBC Mystery Movie\" was a \"wheel show\", or \"umbrella program\" that rotated several programs within the same time period throughout the season. For its initial 1971–72 season, it featured a rotation of three detective dramas that were broadcast on Wednesday nights for 90 minutes, from 8:30–10:00 p.m. in the Eastern Time Zone.\n\nThe origin of the \"wheel\" format was a joint programming and creative production agreement between the NBC Television Network and Universal Studios Television and Motion Pictures dating from 1966. By that agreement, NBC ordered a multi-year series of dramatic anthology productions from Universal which would be broadcast as NBC series television programming in the United States (both as originals and re-runs), while Universal retained the rights to overseas release of these products as feature-length films. Also, NBC would not offer these shows subsequently as TV re-runs for international sales.\n\nThe first series created under this agreement was \"The Name of the Game\", a drama with three rotating stars. It was followed by \"The Bold Ones\" and \"Four in One\" (the similar \"The Men\" was produced for ABC and involved series from three studios, although one of them was Universal). While it was a long and profitable collaboration, it finally succumbed to the changes of the commercial broadcast market regarding both structure and content by the end of the decade.\n\nBy the late 1970s, the increasing popularity of situation comedies, coupled with their lower production costs and much greater scheduling flexibility and resale opportunities, surpassed that of these feature-length (90–120 minute) drama anthologies. The anthologies could not reasonably be reduced for shorter broadcast times for the re-run market. They were not designed for casual or short-term viewers, who would have little interest in the characters or the story of an individual episode. Each episode and each series were of widely varying quality, making package re-sale difficult. However, by the early 1980s, various movie episodes from the former \"Mystery Movie\" series were rebroadcast on late night's \"CBS Late Movie\" as a package with an earlier half-hour situation comedy series rerun. While they lasted, the best of them employed the finest actors, writers and production standards available.\n\nThe three original 1971–1972 season shows of \"The NBC Mystery Movie\" were:\n\nThe umbrella series was counted a great success in its first season and finished at number 14 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1971–1972 season. \"Columbo\" was nominated for eight Emmy Awards and won four categories. This success prompted NBC to move the series to the competitive 8:30-10:00 Sunday evening time period for the second season as \"The NBC Sunday Mystery Movie\". In addition, a fourth show was added to the rotation, lasting two seasons (1972–1974):\n\n\nNBC also launched a clone of the umbrella series, \"The NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie\", which debuted in the original time period and featured three new programs:\n\nDuring the 1973–1974 season, the programs rotating on Sunday remained the same, while on Wednesday, \"Cool Million\" and \"Madigan\" were canceled and \"Banacek\" rotated with three new series:\n\nRescheduling to Tuesday nights as \"The NBC Tuesday Mystery Movie\" during January 1974 was not enough to help boost ratings, and the midweek series was canceled. The Sunday series continued, anchored by the popular trio of \"Columbo\", \"McCloud\", and \"McMillan and Wife\".\n\nDuring subsequent years, these rotated with a fourth series, which changed each year (1972–1977), including:\n\nOf all the wheel series, only the original three — \"Columbo\", \"McCloud\" and \"McMillan & Wife\" — survived for the entire run of the \"Mystery Movie\". Most of the others were very short-lived, and, with the exception of \"Hec Ramsey\" and \"Banacek\", were all only on the air for one season. \"Quincy, M.E.\", which was the next to last new \"Mystery Movie\" series to premiere, ended up outlasting the parent series itself; midway through the final \"Mystery Movie\" season, \"Quincy\" was taken out of the wheel lineup and retooled into a one-hour weekly series that ran for seven more seasons, coming to an end in 1983.\n\nAlthough the \"Mystery Movie\" series was cancelled at the end of the 1976–1977 season, NBC kept \"Columbo\" in production and a seventh season consisting of five films premiered on November 21, 1977. After the fifth film aired in May 1978, NBC cancelled \"Columbo\" as well.\n\nThe \"Mystery Movie\" theme music was composed by Henry Mancini.\n\nThe opening credits consisted of a shadowed figure carrying a flashlight slowly walking toward the camera in a desert landscape under dramatically lit clouds, as images of the various rotating series appeared sequentially on the screen; at the end, an announcer (Hank Sims) presented the night's main actors and series \"(example: \"tonight, starring Peter Falk as Columbo\")\". Some syndicated episodes of \"Columbo\" retain this opening credit sequence, though slowed toward the end to avoid showing the title caption which includes \"NBC\" and (after the first season), a day of the week.\n\nThe \"Wednesday Mystery Movie\" theme was composed by Quincy Jones for its first season and had an animated open to show the lineup.\n\nIn 1989, Universal Television and ABC teamed to launch a revival of the mystery wheel, titled the ABC Monday Mystery Movie. The network brought back original \"Mystery Movie\" series \"Columbo\" to be part of the wheel, with Peter Falk returning in the title role. Two new series joined Columbo in its first year, \"Gideon Oliver\", starring Louis Gossett, Jr. as a crime solving anthropologist, and \"B.L. Stryker\", which featured Burt Reynolds as a South Florida private investigator.\n\nColumbo continued in its second season on Saturday (as \"ABC Saturday Mystery Movie\") with two other films series in August 1990. The new \"Christine Cromwell\", a San Francisco based mystery starring Jaclyn Smith. The wheel was completed with a revival of CBS' 1970s crime drama \"Kojak\". The wheel series ran irregularly from February 1989 until August 1990. After the series ended, ABC kept \"Columbo\" in production and Falk starred in an additional fourteen films before the network discontinued the series in 2003.\n\nNBC, meanwhile, brought \"McCloud\" back for a reunion film in 1989. The film, titled \"The Return of Sam McCloud\", featured Dennis Weaver in the role of United States Senator Sam McCloud.\n\nIn the fall of 1993, NBC made an attempt to revive the wheel format, this time called \"The NBC Friday Night Mystery\". As originally conceived, this rotation was supposed to include:\n\n\n\"NBC Mystery Movie\" maintained high ratings finishing in the top 30 of shows for the first four seasons. The show rated as the following:\n"}
{"id": "3042082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3042082", "title": "Which Lie Did I Tell?", "text": "Which Lie Did I Tell?\n\nWhich Lie Did I Tell?: More Adventures in the Screen Trade is a work of non-fiction first published in 2000 by novelist and screenwriter William Goldman. It is the follow-up to his 1982 book \"Adventures in the Screen Trade\".\n\nOriginally to be called \"The Big Campfire\", the inspiration for the title came when Goldman was in the office of a Hollywood producer who was talking on the phone to one of his associates. Suddenly he cupped his hands over the receiver, snapped his fingers and said “Bill, Bill! Which lie did I tell?”\n\nThe book begins with more stories about movies he has been involved with, starting with the period from 1982—when \"Adventures in the Screen Trade\" was published—to 1986 when he received no movie work. Goldman then tells the unfortunate story of how he became mixed up in \"Memoirs of an Invisible Man\", before the saving grace of \"The Princess Bride\" brought him his first screen credit in nearly nine years. Other adventures are \"Misery\", \"The Year of the Comet\" (which he uses as an example of how a movie can become a failure at the script level), \"Maverick\" (which he uses as an example of the principle that the best scene sometimes needs to be cut), \"The Ghost and the Darkness\" (which he uses as an example of how ego can hinder a film's production and artistic integrity) and \"Absolute Power\" (which he uses as an example to illustrate why a movie does not have to be faithful to the book on which it is based). Two films he does not cover are \"Heat\" (for legal reasons) and \"The Chamber\" (because it was not remotely interesting).\n\nThe next part of the book has Goldman analyzing scenes from various screenplays he admires including \"There's Something About Mary\", \"North by Northwest\" and \"Chinatown\".\n\nThe next section covers how he gets movie ideas, and details four examples and why he didn't pursue them.\n\n\"The Old Guy,\" inspired by the true story about an elderly criminal (recently made into a 2018 movie, \"The Old Man and The Gun,\" apparently without Goldman's participation). Goldman learned of the story in an April 1999 article in the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\n\"The Good Guy,\" an original story idea linking characters in the Littleton, Colorado school shooting and the JonBenet Ramsey murder, which took place in Boulder, CO.\n\"The Mastermind,\" expanding on the actual 1911 theft of the \"Mona Lisa\" painting, partially based on Seymour Reit's book \"The Day They Stole The Mona Lisa\".\n\n\"The Dolphin,\" inspired by a New York Times article about an autistic 10 year-old boy surviving four days lost in an alligator and snake infested Florida swamp.\n\nThe final section is an original screenplay where he examines the writing process and asks other famous screenwriters for their opinions.\n\nIn between chapters are various musings on a range of topics from why not to open a script with a courtroom scene to how he sets about adapting a book. Some of these snippets offer an insight into Goldman's background that was not in the first book—such as his relationship with his parents, his university life and time in the military—the book thereby shading into autobiography.\n\nThe chapters on \"The Princess Bride\", \"Misery\", \"Maverick\" and \"The Ghost and the Darkness\" originally appeared in his books \"Four Screenplays\" and \"Five Screenplays\" and in the published shooting script for \"The Ghost and the Darkness\".\n\nMichael Sragow describes \"Which Lie Did I Tell? (More Adventures in the Screen Trade)\": \"In addition to brief descriptions of topics like \"spitballing\" (brainstorming story notions) and expansions or reprints of behind-the-scenes stories already published as introductions to Goldman's screenplays, it contains famous scenes from other writers' screenplays; how-to advice on judging ideas, on turning ideas into stories and on writing them in a way that hooks the attention of a director or a star; and a partial draft of a script, with reactions from esteemed peers.\" \"School Library Journal\" wrote about \"Which Lie Did I Tell?\", \"From \"The Memoirs of an Invisible Man\" to \"Absolute Power\", this master storyteller explains his role and his thought processes for each film, at the same time delivering an exposition on how stories are written and films are made. Sprinkled throughout is his advice for future screenwriters. In the second section, he analyzes classic film sequences, setting each scene, quoting excerpts from the screenplays, and then explaining what made them great. Finally, the author offers story ideas and examines their potential for the big screen.\"\n\n"}
