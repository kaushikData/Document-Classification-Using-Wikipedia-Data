Many animals, at least in more commercial sports, are highly trained. Two of the most common animals in sport are horses and dogs.\n\nThere are many types of animal sporting events, with varying levels of participation from humans. Some are solely between the animals while others use the animals in a lesser role. Most sports involve training, while some can also involve selective breeding.\n\nThere are some large-scale events that include animals in a variety of sports. A rodeo can comprise many different sports, ranging from bull riding to pole bending. Some of the most well known types of animal racing may be, Horse racing, Dog racing (Greyhound racing), Pigeon racing, Camel racing, and (even Mule racing which mainly takes place in some parts of California etc,) as well as many more.\n\nRacing is the most popular form of animal-related sport, particularly horse racing. Some racing events directly involve humans as riders while others see the animals race alone. In some sports the rider is not directly riding the animal, instead being pulled along. Examples of this include harness racing, dogsled racing and popular ancient Greece and Roman Empire sport of chariot racing.\n\nGreyhound racing, a popular form of animal racing, dates back to the 1800s in the United States, after the dogs were brought over from Europe to help control the hare population. While track racing is the most common, there are other forms of racing. Pigeon racing, for example, sees homing pigeons finding their way home from a set distance away. Kambala, he-buffalo racing in coastal Karnataka, India is a rural spectator racing conducted every year during winter in about 50 towns/villages.\nRacing events are a common way to gamble, with billions spent worldwide every year. This is one reason that some countries or states have made such sports illegal.\n\nThere are some non-racing competitive events involving animals. Polo is an example, with competitors hitting a ball with mallets while on horseback. Elephant polo dates back to the early 20th century when members of the British aristocracy in Nepal began playing the sport.\n\nIn the 14th to 16th centuries jousting was a popular one-on-one tournament event involving knights on horseback.\n\nIn most counties the act of two or more animals fighting each other, such as cockfighting, and dog fighting, is seen as cruel and is therefore illegal. Some legal animal fights take place around the world, including cow fighting and camel wrestling. There are also some legal forms of sport where humans fight animals, such as bullfighting which has a long history in Spanish and Portuguese tradition. Not all animals are large, however, with cricket fighting being a popular (though illegal to gamble on) sport in Macau and Hong Kong.\n\nThere are several other blood sports in history that were intended as entertainment, many of which involved baiting by dogs. Many different types of animal have been placed into a pit, sometimes tied to a post, and set upon by dogs. This ranges from rat-baiting and badger-baiting to bear-baiting and lion-baiting. There are even some tales of human-baiting.\n\nAnimals that take part in animal fights are usually specifically bred for strength and stamina.\n\nHunting began as a crucial component of hunter-gatherer societies, being an important source of food. The domestication of animals and the development of agriculture lessened the need for hunts, with food being more readily available. Hunting became a sport for those of the high social classes. In most parts of medieval Europe, the upper-class (aristocracy and higher clergy) obtained as privilege the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory.\n\nDangerous hunting, as for lions or wild boars, usually on horseback (or from a chariot, as in Pharaonic Egypt and Mesopotamia) also had function similar to tournaments and manly sports: an honourable, somewhat competitive pastime to help the aristocracy practice skills of war in times of peace. In ancient Rome the \"Venatio\" was a form of entertainment that pitted humans against animals in an amphitheater.\n\nIn modern times, hunting is usually legal as long as the hunter has a license, though there are some unregulated forms in some countries. Animals can be on either side of a hunt, assisting the hunters or being hunted themselves.\n\nFox hunting has been a controversial issue, particularly in the United Kingdom, regarding its necessity and the cruelty involved (See Fox hunting legislation).\n\nFishing is somewhat different from other sports and is most commonly a pastime or hobby. However, it can also be a competitive sport.\n\nPigeon shooting was one of the shooting events of the 1900 Summer Olympics. Competitors in these events had to kill as many live pigeons as possible. Birds were released one at a time from 'traps' in front of the shooters.\n\nShows are intended to highlight the excellence of training or breeding of the animals involved. There is a variety of horse riding sports in this category, including show jumping and dressage, both of which are featured at the Olympic Games. At lower levels, horse shows offer a wide variety of competition both riding and driving as well as In-hand classes that evaluate equine conformation.\n\nDogs, being easily domesticated, are one of the most popular animals to have in shows. Cattle and sheepdog trials are popular in many countries and are used to show how well a dog can gather livestock. Other dog sports of this category include dog agility events, whereby the dogs must tackle obstacle courses, and obedience trials, where they must execute a predefined set of tasks.\n\nCrufts, a British conformation show for dogs, has grown since it started in 1886. While dogs are the most common show animal, cat shows are also common. Both of these animals have a wide variety of breeds and compete in categories, comparing each individual to the breed \"ideal.\"\n\nSome unusual animals also take part in shows, such as the competitors in rabbit show jumping and common chaffinches in vinkenzetting.\n\nFilms and television series about animals in sport can be realistic or fictional, involving animals in an activity that they cannot really perform. \"Seabiscuit\" is a fairly accurate portrayal of the famous American horse of the same name, while \"\", a film about a hockey-playing chimpanzee, is unrealistic.\n\nThe 1980 animated film \"Animalympics\" is a spoof of the Olympic Games and features anthropomorphicised animals. In the combination live action and animation film \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\", animated animals play a game of football. Similarly, several television commercials used the Budweiser Clydesdales and other animals in live-action and CGA roles to appear to be playing American football.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1999, the BBC broadcast \"One Man and His Dog\", a television series about sheepdog trials. They also commissioned three series of \"Pets Win Prizes\", a game show with contestants' pets having to perform in various tasks.\n\n\"Man vs. Beast\" is an American television show that pitches humans against animals in a variety of unusual challenges, including competitive eating between world champion Takeru Kobayashi and a brown bear.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19230351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19230351", "title": "Aquarium", "text": "Aquarium\n\nAn aquarium (plural: \"aquariums\" or \"aquaria\") is a vivarium of any size having at least one transparent side in which aquatic plants or animals are kept and displayed. Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians, aquatic reptiles such as turtles, and aquatic plants. The term \"aquarium\", coined by English naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, combines the Latin root \"aqua\", meaning water, with the suffix \"-arium\", meaning \"a place for relating to\". The aquarium principle was fully developed in 1850 by the chemist Robert Warington, who explained that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals, so long as the numbers of animals did not grow too large. The aquarium craze was launched in early Victorian England by Gosse, who created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London Zoo in 1853, and published the first manual, \"The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea\" in 1854. An aquarium is a water-filled tank in which fish swim about. Small aquariums are kept in the home by hobbyists. There are larger public aquariums in many cities. This kind of aquarium is a building with fish and other aquatic animals in large tanks. A large aquarium may have otters, turtles, dolphins, and other sea animals. Most aquarium tanks also have plants.\n\nAn aquarist owns fish or maintains an aquarium, typically constructed of glass or high-strength acrylic. Cuboid aquaria are also known as fish tanks or simply tanks, while bowl-shaped aquaria are also known as fish bowls. Size can range from a small glass bowl, under a gallon in volume, to immense public aquaria of several thousand gallons. Specialized equipment maintains appropriate water quality and other characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents.\n\nIn 1369, the Hongwu Emperor of China established a porcelain company that produced large porcelain tubs for maintaining goldfish; over time, people produced tubs that approached the shape of modern fish bowls. Leonhard Baldner, who wrote \"Vogel-, Fisch- und Tierbuch\" (Bird, Fish, and Animal Book) in 1666, maintained weather loaches and newts. It is sometimes held that the aquarium was invented by the Romans, who are said to have kept sea barbels in marble-and-glass tanks, but this is unlikely to be true.\n\nIn 1832, Jeanne Villepreux-Power, a pioneering French marine biologist, became the first person to create aquaria for experimenting with aquatic organisms. In 1836, soon after his invention of the Wardian case, Dr. Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward proposed to use his tanks for tropical animals. In 1841 he did so, though only with aquatic plants and toy fish. However, he soon housed real animals. In 1838, Félix Dujardin noted owning a saltwater aquarium, though he did not use the term. In 1846, Anne Thynne maintained stony corals and seaweed for almost three years, and was credited as the creator of the first balanced marine aquarium in London. English chemist Robert Warington experimented with a 13-gallon container, which contained goldfish, eelgrass, and snails, creating one of the first stable aquaria. The aquarium principle was fully developed by Warington, explaining that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals, so long as their numbers do not grow too large. He published his findings in 1850 in the Chemical Society's journal.\nThe keeping of fish in an aquarium became a popular hobby and spread quickly. In the United Kingdom, it became popular after ornate aquaria in cast-iron frames were featured at the Great Exhibition of 1851. In 1853, the aquarium craze was launched in England by Philip Henry Gosse who created and stocked the first public aquarium in the London Zoo which came to be known as the Fish House. Gosse coined the word \"aquarium\", opting for this term (instead of \"aquatic vivarium\" or \"aqua-vivarium\") in 1854 in his book \"The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea\". In this book, Gosse primarily discussed saltwater aquaria. In the 1850s, the aquarium became a fad in the United Kingdom.\nTank designs and techniques for maintaining water quality were developed by Warington, later cooperating with Gosse until his critical review of the tank water composition. Edward Edwards developed these glass-fronted aquaria in his 1858 patent for a \"dark-water-chamber slope-back tank\", with water slowly circulating to a reservoir beneath. \nGermans soon rivaled the British in their interest. In 1854, an anonymous author had two articles published about the saltwater aquaria of the United Kingdom: \"Die Gartenlaube\" (The Garden House) entitled \"Der Ocean auf dem Tische\" (The Ocean on the Table). However, in 1856, \"Der See im Glase\" (The Lake in a Glass) was published, discussing freshwater aquaria, which were much easier to maintain in landlocked areas. In 1862 William Alford Lloyd, then bankrupt because of the craze in England being over, moved to Grindel Dammthor, Hamburg, to supervise the installation of the circulating system and tanks at the Hamburg Aquarium. During the 1870s, some of the first aquarist societies were appearing in Germany. The United States soon followed. Published in 1858, Henry D. Butler's \"The Family Aquarium\" was one of the first books written in the United States solely about the aquarium. According to the July issue of \"The North American Review\" of the same year, William Stimson may have owned some of the first functional aquaria, and had as many as seven or eight. The first aquarist society in the United States was founded in New York City in 1893, followed by others. The \"New York Aquarium Journal\", first published in October 1876, is considered to be the world's first aquarium magazine.\nIn the Victorian era in the United Kingdom, a common design for the home aquarium was a glass front with the other sides made of wood (made watertight with a pitch coating). The bottom would be made of slate and heated from below. More advanced systems soon began to be introduced, along with tanks of glass in metal frames. During the latter half of the 19th century, a variety of aquarium designs were explored, such as hanging the aquarium on a wall, mounting it as part of a window, or even combining it with a birdcage.\n\nAround 1908, the first mechanical aquarium air pump was invented, powered by running water, instead of electricity. The introduction of the air pump into the hobby is considered by several historians of the hobby to be a pivotal moment in its development.\nAquaria became more widely popular as houses had an electricity supply after World War I. Electricity allowed artificial lighting, as well as aeration, filtration, and heating of the water. Initially, amateur aquarists kept native fish (with the exception of goldfish); the availability of exotic species from overseas further increased the popularity of the aquarium. Jugs made from a variety of materials were used to import fish from overseas, with a bicycle foot pump for aeration. Plastic shipping bags were introduced in the 1950s, making it easier to ship fish. The eventual availability of air freight allowed fish to be successfully imported from distant regions. Popular publications started by Herbert R. Axelrod influenced many more hobbyists to start keeping fish. In the 1960s, metal frames made marine aquaria almost impossible due to corrosion, but the development of tar and silicone sealant allowed the first all-glass aquaria made by Martin Horowitz in Los Angeles, CA. The frames remained, however, though purely for aesthetic reasons.\n\nJapan played an increasingly important role in shaping aquarium design in the latter part of the twentieth century, with the aquascaping designs of Takashi Amano influencing fishkeepers to treat home aquariums as aesthetically pleasing compositions, rather than simply as a way of displaying fish specimens.\n\nIn the United States, as of 1996, aquarium keeping is the second-most popular hobby after stamp collecting. In 1999, an estimated 9.6 million US households owned an aquarium. Figures from the 2005/2006 APPMA National Pet Owners Survey report that Americans own approximately 139 million freshwater fish and 9.6 million saltwater fish. Estimates of the numbers of fish kept in aquaria in Germany suggest at least 36 million. The hobby has the strongest following in Europe, Asia, and North America. In the United States, 40% of aquarists maintain two or more tanks.\n\nOver time, there has been an increasing appreciation of the usefulness of access to an aquarium to provide potential stress reduction and improvement of mood in people observing aquatic life.\nMost aquaria consist of glass panes bonded together by 100% silicone sealant, with plastic frames attached to the upper and lower edges for decoration. The glass aquarium is standard for sizes up to about . However, glass as a material is brittle and has very little give before fracturing, though generally the sealant fails first. Aquaria are made in a variety of shapes, such as cuboid, hexagonal, angled to fit in a corner (L-shaped), and bow-front (the front side curves outwards). Fish bowls are generally either made of plastic or glass, and are either spherical or some other round configuration in shape.\n\nThe very first modern aquarium made of glass was developed in the 19th century by Robert Warrington. During the Victorian age, glass aquariums commonly had slate or steel bottoms, which allowed them to be heated underneath by an open-flame heat source. These aquariums had the glass panels attached with metal frames and sealed with putty. Metal-framed aquariums were still available until the mid-1960s, when the modern, silicone-sealed style replaced them. Acrylic aquariums first became available to the public in the 1970s. Laminated glass is sometimes used, which combines the advantages of both glass and acrylic.\n\nGlass aquaria have been a popular choice for many home and hobbyist aquarists for many years. Once silicone sealant became strong enough to ensure a long-term water-tight seal, it eliminated the need for a structural frame. In addition to lower cost, glass aquaria are more scratch resistant than acrylic. Although the price is one of the main considerations for aquarists when deciding which of these two types of aquaria to purchase, for very large tanks, the price difference tends to disappear.\nAcrylic aquaria are now the primary competitor with glass. Prior to the invention of UV stabilization, early acrylic aquaria discolored over time with exposure to light; this is no longer the case. Acrylic is generally stronger than glass, weighs less, and provides a certain amount of temperature insulation. In colder climates or environments, it is easier to achieve and maintain a tropical temperature and requires less capacity from an aquarium heater. Acrylic-soluble cements are used to directly fuse acrylic together. Acrylic allows for the formation of unusual shapes, such as the hexagonal tank. Compared to glass, acrylics are easier to scratch; but unlike glass, it is possible to polish out scratches in acrylic.\n\nLarge aquaria might instead use stronger materials such as fiberglass-reinforced plastics. However, this material is not transparent. Reinforced concrete is used for aquaria where weight and space are not factors. Concrete must be coated with a waterproof layer to prevent the water from breaking down the concrete, as well as preventing contamination of the water by the concrete.\n\nPlywood can also be used when building aquaria. The benefits of using plywood include: lower construction costs, less weight, and better insulation. A popular positioning choice for plywood aquaria is keeping them in a wall. Here the use of plywood is hidden by sinking the aquarium inside the wall. Putting insulation between the two helps with the insulation of a heated tank.\n\nObjects used for aquariums include: coffee tables, sinks, gumball machines and even toilets. Another such example is the MacQuarium, an aquarium made from the shell of an Apple Macintosh computer. In recent years, elaborate custom-designed home aquariums costing hundreds of thousands of dollars have become status symbols—according to \"The New York Times\", \"among people of means, a dazzling aquarium is one of the last surefire ways to impress their peers.\"\n\nA kreisel tank (\"kreisel\" being German for \"spinning top\" or \"gyroscope\") is an aquarium shaped like a horizontal cylinder that is designed to hold delicate animals such as jellyfish and newborn seahorses. These aquariums provide slow, circular water flow with a bare minimum of interior hardware to prevent the inhabitants from becoming injured by pumps or the tank itself. The tank has no sharp angles around its sides and keeps the housed animals away from plumbing. Water moving into the tank gives a gentle flow that keeps the inhabitants suspended. Water leaves the tank through a screen which prevents animals from being drawn into the pump intake or overflow line.\n\nThere are several types of kreisel tanks. In a true kreisel, a circular tank has a circular, submerged lid. \"Pseudokreisels\" are \"U\" or semicircle shaped, usually without a lid. \"Stretch kreisels\" are a \"double gyre\" kreisel design, where the tank length is at least twice the height. Using two downwelling inlets on both sides of the tank lets gravity create two gyres in the tank. A single downwelling inlet may be used in the middle as well. The top of a stretch kreisel may be open or closed with a lid. There may also be screens about midway down the sides of the tank, or at the top on the sides. It is possible to combine these designs; a circular shaped tank is used without a lid or cover, and the surface of the water acts as the continuation of circular flow.\n\nAnother popular setup is the biotope aquarium. A biotope aquarium is a recreation of a specific natural environment. Some of the most popular biotopes are the freshwater habitats of the Amazon and Rio Negro rivers, the African rift lake environments of Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika, and saltwater coral reefs of Australia, the Red Sea, and the Caribbean. The fish, plants, substrate, rocks, wood, coral, and any other component of the display should completely match that of the local natural environment. It can be a challenge to recreate such environments, and most \"true\" biotopes will only have a few (if not only one) species of fish and invertebrates.\n\nFinally, an emerging concept for the home is that of a wall mounted aquarium, some of which are displayed at the Living Art Marine Center.\n\nAn aquarium can range from a small glass bowl containing less than of water to immense public aquaria that house entire ecosystems such as kelp forests. Relatively large home aquaria resist rapid fluctuations of temperature and pH, allowing for greater system stability. Beginner aquarists are advised to consider larger tanks to begin with, as controlling water parameters in smaller tanks can prove difficult.\n\nUnfiltered bowl-shaped aquaria are now widely regarded as unsuitable for most fish. Advanced alternatives are now available. In order to keep water conditions at suitable levels, aquariums should contain at least two forms of filtration: biological and mechanical. Chemical filtration should also be considered under some circumstances for optimum water quality. Chemical filtration is frequently achieved via activated carbon, to filter medications, tannins, and/or other known impurities from the water.\n\nReef aquaria under have a special place in the aquarium hobby; these aquaria, termed nano reefs (when used in reefkeeping), have a small water volume, under .\nPractical limitations, most notably the weight of water () and internal water pressure (requiring thick glass siding) of a large aquarium, restrict most home aquaria to a maximum of around 1 cubic metre in volume (1000 L, weighing or ). Some aquarists, however, have constructed aquaria of many thousands of litres.\n\nPublic aquariums and oceanariums designed for exhibition of large species or environments can be dramatically larger than any home aquarium. The Georgia Aquarium, for example, features an individual aquarium of .\n\nA new trend is to have very small aquariums, termed mini aquariums (less than 150 litres or 40 gallons) or nano aquariums (less than 75 litres or 20 gallons). These can be either freshwater or saltwater, and are intended to display a tiny but self-contained ecosystem.\nThe typical hobbyist aquarium includes a filtration system, an artificial lighting system, and a heater or chiller depending on the aquarium's inhabitants. Many aquaria incorporate a hood, containing the lights, to decrease evaporation and prevent fish from leaving the aquarium (and anything else from entering the aquarium).\n\nCombined biological and mechanical aquarium filtration systems are common. These either convert ammonia to nitrate (removing nitrogen at the expense of aquatic plants), or to sometimes remove phosphate. Filter media can house microbes that mediate nitrification. Filtration systems are sometimes the most complex component of home aquaria.\n\nAquarium heaters combine a heating element with a thermostat, allowing the aquarist to regulate water temperature at a level above that of the surrounding air, whereas coolers and chillers (refrigeration devices) are for use anywhere, such as cold water aquaria, where the ambient room temperature is above the desired tank temperature. Thermometers used include glass alcohol thermometers, adhesive external plastic strip thermometers, and battery-powered LCD thermometers. In addition, some aquarists use air pumps attached to airstones or water pumps to increase water circulation and supply adequate gas exchange at the water surface. Wave-making devices have also been constructed to provide wave action.\n\nAn aquarium's physical characteristics form another aspect of aquarium design. Size, lighting conditions, density of floating and rooted plants, placement of bog-wood, creation of caves or overhangs, type of substrate, and other factors (including an aquarium's positioning within a room) can all affect the behavior and survival of tank inhabitants.\n\nAn aquarium can be placed on an aquarium stand. Because of the weight of the aquarium, a stand must be strong as well as level. A tank that is not level may distort, leak, or crack. These are often built with cabinets to allow storage, available in many styles to match room decor. Simple metal tank stands are also available. Most aquaria should be placed on polystyrene to cushion any irregularities on the underlying surface or the bottom of the tank itself that may cause cracks. However, some tanks have an underframe making this unnecessary.\n\nLarge volumes of water enable more stability in a tank by diluting effects from death or contamination events that push an aquarium away from equilibrium. The bigger the tank, the easier such a systemic shock is to absorb, because the effects of that event are diluted. For example, the death of the only fish in an tank causes dramatic changes in the system, while the death of that same fish in a tank with many other fish in it represents only a minor change. For this reason, hobbyists often favor larger tanks, as they require less attention.\n\nSeveral nutrient cycles are important in the aquarium. Dissolved oxygen enters the system at the surface water-air interface. Similarly, carbon dioxide escapes the system into the air. The phosphate cycle is an important, although often overlooked, nutrient cycle. Sulfur, iron, and micronutrients also cycle through the system, entering as food and exiting as waste. Appropriate handling of the nitrogen cycle, along with supplying an adequately balanced food supply and considered biological loading, is enough to keep these other nutrient cycles in approximate equilibrium.\n\nAn aquarium must be maintained regularly to ensure that the fish are kept healthy. Daily maintenance consists of checking the fish for signs of stress and disease. Also, aquarists must make sure that the water has a good quality and it is not cloudy or foamy and the temperature of the water is appropriate for the particular species of fish that live in the aquarium.\n\nTypical weekly maintenance includes changing around 10–20% of the water while cleaning the gravel, or other substrate if the aquarium has one; however some manage to avoid this entirely by keeping it somewhat self-sufficient. A good habit is to remove the water being replaced by \"vacuuming\" the gravel with suitable implements, as this will eliminate uneaten foods and other residues that settle on the substrate. In many areas tap water is not considered to be safe for fish to live in because it contains chemicals that harm the fish. Tap water from those areas must be treated with a suitable water conditioner, such as a product which removes chlorine and chloramine and neutralizes any heavy metals present. The water conditions must be checked both in the tank and in the replacement water, to make sure they are suitable for the species.\n\nThe solute content of water is perhaps the most important aspect of water conditions, as total dissolved solids and other constituents dramatically impact basic water chemistry, and therefore how organisms interact with their environment. Salt content, or salinity, is the most basic measure of water conditions. An aquarium may have freshwater (salinity below 500 parts per million), simulating a lake or river environment; brackish water (a salt level of 500 to 30,000 PPM), simulating environments lying between fresh and salt, such as estuaries; and salt water or seawater (a salt level of 30,000 to 40,000 PPM), simulating an ocean environment. Rarely, higher salt concentrations are maintained in specialized tanks for raising brine organisms.\n\nSaltwater is typically alkaline, while the pH (alkalinity or acidicity) of fresh water varies more. Hardness measures overall dissolved mineral content; hard or soft water may be preferred. Hard water is usually alkaline, while soft water is usually neutral to acidic. Dissolved organic content and dissolved gases content are also important factors.\n\nHome aquarists typically use tap water supplied through their local water supply network to fill their tanks. Straight tap water cannot be used in localities that pipe chlorinated water. In the past, it was possible to \"condition\" the water by simply letting the water stand for a day or two, which allows the chlorine time to dissipate. However, chloramine is now used more often and does not leave the water as readily. Additives formulated to remove chlorine or chloramine are often all that is needed to make the water ready for aquarium use. Brackish or saltwater aquaria require the addition of a commercially available mixture of salts and other minerals.\n\nSome aquarists modify water's alkalinity, hardness, or dissolved content of organics and gases, before adding it to their aquaria. This can be accomplished by additives, such as sodium bicarbonate, to raise pH. Some aquarists filter or purify their water through deionization or reverse osmosis prior to using it. In contrast, public aquaria with large water needs often locate themselves near a natural water source (such as a river, lake, or ocean) to reduce the level of treatment. Some hobbyists use an algae scrubber to filter the water naturally.\n\nWater temperature determines the two most basic aquarium classifications: tropical versus cold water. Most fish and plant species tolerate only a limited temperature range; tropical aquaria, with an average temperature of about , are much more common. Cold water aquaria are for fish that are better suited to a cooler environment. More important than the range is consistency; most organisms are not accustomed to sudden changes in temperatures, which can cause shock and lead to disease. Water temperature can be regulated with a thermostat and heater (or cooler).\n\nWater movement can also be important in simulating a natural ecosystem. Aquarists may prefer anything from still water up to swift currents, depending on the aquarium's inhabitants. Water movement can be controlled via aeration from air pumps, powerheads, and careful design of internal water flow (such as location of filtration system points of inflow and outflow).\n\nOf primary concern to the aquarist is management of the waste produced by an aquarium's inhabitants. Fish, invertebrates, fungi, and some bacteria excrete nitrogen waste in the form of ammonia (which converts to ammonium, in water) and must then either pass through the nitrogen cycle or be removed by passing through zeolite. Ammonia is also produced through the decomposition of plant and animal matter, including fecal matter and other detritus. Nitrogen waste products become toxic to fish and other aquarium inhabitants at high concentrations. In the wild, the vast amount of water surrounding the fish dilutes ammonia and other waste materials. When fish are put into an aquarium, waste can quickly reach toxic concentrations in the enclosed environment unless the tank is cycled to remove waste.\n\nA well-balanced tank contains organisms that are able to metabolize the waste products of other aquarium residents. This process is known in the aquarium hobby as the nitrogen cycle. Bacteria known as nitrifiers (genus \"Nitrosomonas\") metabolize nitrogen waste. Nitrifying bacteria capture ammonia from the water and metabolize it to produce nitrite. Nitrite is toxic to fish in high concentrations. Another type of bacteria (genus \"Nitrospira\") converts nitrite into nitrate, a less toxic substance. (\"Nitrobacter\" bacteria were previously believed to fill this role. While biologically they could theoretically fill the same niche as \"Nitrospira\", it has recently been found that \"Nitrobacter\" are not present in detectable levels in established aquaria, while \"Nitrospira\" are plentiful.) However, commercial products sold as kits to \"jump start\" the nitrogen cycle often still contain \"Nitrobacter\".\n\nIn addition to bacteria, aquatic plants also eliminate nitrogen waste by metabolizing ammonia and nitrate. When plants metabolize nitrogen compounds, they remove nitrogen from the water by using it to build biomass that decays more slowly than ammonia-driven plankton already dissolved in the water.\n\nWhat hobbyists call the nitrogen cycle is only a portion of the complete cycle: nitrogen must be added to the system (usually through food provided to the tank inhabitants), and nitrates accumulate in the water at the end of the process, or become bound in the biomass of plants. The aquarium keeper must remove water once nitrate concentrations grow, or remove plants which have grown from the nitrates.\n\nHobbyist aquaria often do not have sufficient bacteria populations to adequately denitrify waste. This problem is most often addressed through two filtration solutions: Activated carbon filters absorb nitrogen compounds and other toxins, while biological filters provide a medium designed to enhance bacterial colonization. Activated carbon and other substances, such as ammonia absorbing resins, stop working when their pores fill, so these components have to be replaced regularly.\n\nNew aquaria often have problems associated with the nitrogen cycle due to insufficient beneficial bacteria. Therefore, fresh water has to be matured before stocking them with fish. There are three basic approaches to this: the \"fishless cycle\", the \"silent cycle\" and \"slow growth\".\n\nIn a fishless cycle, small amounts of ammonia are added to an unpopulated tank to feed the bacteria. During this process, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels are tested to monitor progress. The \"silent\" cycle is basically nothing more than densely stocking the aquarium with fast-growing aquatic plants and relying on them to consume the nitrogen, allowing the necessary bacterial populations time to develop. According to anecdotal reports, the plants can consume nitrogenous waste so efficiently that ammonia and nitrite level spikes seen in more traditional cycling methods are greatly reduced or disappear. \"Slow growth\" entails slowly increasing the population of fish over a period of 6 to 8 weeks, giving bacteria colonies time to grow and stabilize with the increase in fish waste. This method is usually done with a small starter population of hardier fish which can survive the ammonia and nitrite spikes, whether they are intended to be permanent residents or to be traded out later for the desired occupants.\n\nThe largest bacterial populations are found in the filter, where is high water flow and plentiful surface available for their growth, so effective and efficient filtration is vital. Sometimes, a vigorous cleaning of the filter is enough to seriously disturb the biological balance of an aquarium. Therefore, it is recommended to rinse mechanical filters in an outside bucket of aquarium water to dislodge organic materials that contribute to nitrate problems, while preserving bacteria populations. Another safe practice consists of cleaning only half of the filter media during each service, or using two filters, only one of which is cleaned at a time.\n\nThe biological load, or bioload, is a measure of the burden placed on the aquarium ecosystem by its inhabitants. High biological loading presents a more complicated tank ecology, which in turn means that equilibrium is easier to upset. Several fundamental constraints on biological loading depend on aquarium size. The water's surface area limits oxygen intake. The bacteria population depends on the physical space they have available to colonize. Physically, only a limited size and number of plants and animals can fit into an aquarium while still providing room for movement. Biologically, biological loading refers to the rate of biological decay in proportion to tank volume. Adding plants to an aquarium will sometimes help greatly with taking up fish waste as plant nutrients. Although an aquarium can be overloaded with fish, an excess of plants is unlikely to cause harm. Decaying plant material, such as decaying plant leaves, can add these nutrients back into the aquarium if not promptly removed. The bioload is processed by the aquarium's biofilter filtration system.\n\nLimiting factors include the oxygen availability and filtration processing. Aquarists have rules of thumb to estimate the number of fish that can be kept in an aquarium. The examples below are for small freshwater fish; larger freshwater fishes and most marine fishes need much more generous allowances.\n\nExperienced aquarists warn against applying these rules too strictly because they do not consider other important issues such as growth rate, activity level, social behaviour, filtration capacity, total biomass of plant life, and so on. It is better to apply the overall mass and size of a fish per gallon of water, than simply the length. This is because fish of different sizes produce quite differing amounts of waste. Establishing maximum capacity is often a matter of slowly adding fish and monitoring water quality over time, following a trial and error approach.\n\nOne variable is differences between fish. Smaller fish consume more oxygen per gram of body weight than larger fish. Labyrinth fish can breathe atmospheric oxygen and do not need as much surface area (however, some of these fish are territorial, and do not appreciate crowding). Barbs also require more surface area than tetras of comparable size.\n\nOxygen exchange at the surface is an important constraint, and thus the surface area of the aquarium matters. Some aquarists claim that a deeper aquarium holds no more fish than a shallower aquarium with the same surface area. The capacity can be improved by surface movement and water circulation such as through aeration, which not only improves oxygen exchange, but also waste decomposition rates.\n\nWaste density is another variable. Decomposition in solution consumes oxygen. Oxygen dissolves less readily in warmer water; this is a double-edged sword since warmer temperatures make fish more active, so they consume more oxygen.\n\nIn addition to bioload/chemical considerations, aquarists also consider the mutual compatibility of the fish. For instance, predatory fish are usually not kept with small, passive species, and territorial fish are often unsuitable tankmates for shoaling species. Furthermore, fish tend to fare better if given tanks conducive to their size. That is, large fish need large tanks and small fish can do well in smaller tanks. Lastly, the tank can become overcrowded without being overstocked. In other words, the aquarium can be suitable with regard to filtration capacity, oxygen load, and water, yet still be so crowded that the inhabitants are uncomfortable.\n\nFor planted freshwater aquariums, it is also important to maintain a balance between the duration and quality of light, the amount of plants, CO2 and nutrients. For a given amount of light, if there is insufficient number of plants or insufficient CO2 to support the growth of those plants, so as to consume all the nutrients in the tank, the result would be algae growth. While there are fishes and invertebrates that could be introduced in the tank to clean up this algae, the ideal solution would be to find the optimal balance between the above-mentioned factors. Supplemental CO2 can be provided, whose quantity has to be carefully regulated, as too much CO2 may harm the fishes.\n\nFrom the outdoor ponds and glass jars of antiquity, modern aquaria have evolved into a wide range of specialized systems. Individual aquaria can vary in size from a small bowl large enough for only a single small fish, to the huge public aquaria that can simulate entire marine ecosystems.\n\nOne way to classify aquaria is by salinity. Freshwater aquaria are the most popular due to their lower cost. More expensive and complex equipment is required to set up and maintain marine aquaria. Marine aquaria frequently feature a diverse range of invertebrates in addition to species of fish. Brackish water aquaria combine elements of both marine and freshwater fishkeeping. Fish kept in brackish water aquaria generally come from habitats with varying salinity, such as mangrove swamps and estuaries. Subtypes exist within these types, such as the reef aquarium, a typically smaller marine aquarium that houses coral.\n\nAnother classification is by temperature range. Many aquarists choose a tropical aquarium because tropical fish tend to be more colorful. However, the coldwater aquarium is also popular, which is mainly restricted to goldfish, but can include fish from temperate areas worldwide and native fish keeping.\nAquaria may be grouped by their species selection. The community tank is the most common today, where several non-aggressive species live peacefully. In these aquaria, the fish, invertebrates, and plants probably do not originate from the same geographic region, but tolerate similar water conditions. Aggressive tanks, in contrast, house a limited number of species that can be aggressive toward other fish, or are able to withstand aggression well. Most marine tanks and tanks housing cichlids have to take the aggressiveness of the desired species into account when stocking. Specimen tanks usually only house one fish species, along with plants, perhaps ones found in the fishes' natural environment and decorations simulating a natural ecosystem. This type is useful for fish that cannot coexist with other fish, such as the electric eel, as an extreme example. Some tanks of this sort are used simply to house adults for breeding.\n\nEcotype, ecotope, or biotope aquaria is another type based on species selection. In it, an aquarist attempts to simulate a specific natural ecosystem, assembling fish, invertebrate species, plants, decorations and water conditions all found in that ecosystem. These biotope aquaria are the most sophisticated hobby aquaria; public aquaria use this approach whenever possible. This approach best simulates the experience of observing in the wild. It typically serves as the healthiest possible artificial environment for the tank's occupants.\n\nMost public aquarium facilities feature a number of smaller aquaria, as well those too large for home aquarists. The largest tanks hold millions of gallons of water and can house large species, including sharks or beluga whales. Dolphinaria are specifically for dolphins. Aquatic and semiaquatic animals, including otters and penguins, may also be kept by public aquaria. Public aquaria may also be included in larger establishments such as a marine mammal park or a marine park.\n\nA virtual aquarium is a computer program which uses 3D graphics to reproduce an aquarium on a personal computer. The swimming fish are rendered in real time, while the background of the tank is usually static. Objects on the floor of the tank may be mapped in simple planes so that the fish may appear to swim both in front and behind them, but a relatively simple 3D map of the general shape of such objects may be used to allow the light and ripples on the surface of the water to cast realistic shadows. Bubbles and water noises are common for virtual aquariums, which are often used as screensavers.\n\nThe number of each type of fish can usually be selected, often including other animals like starfish, jellyfish, seahorses, and even sea turtles. Most companies that produce virtual aquarium software also offer other types of fish for sale via Internet download. Other objects found in an aquarium can also be added and rearranged on some software, like treasure chests and giant clams that open and close with air bubbles, or a bobbing diver. There are also usually features that allow the user to tap on the glass or put food in the top, both of which the fish will react to. Some also have the ability to allow the user to edit fish and other objects to create new varieties.\n\n\n"}

It was established in 1787 by the theatre and art loving King Gustav III and was for many years under the protection of the Swedish royal family.\n\nThe school was founded in 1787. Previously, actors had been educated as personal students of individual actors at the theatre, but it was decided that a school was necessary for a more secure succession of the profession and to teach children in the profession from the start from examples made by the continent. In 1788, it was called The Children's Theatre, teaching children between the ages of 9-14. The school is noted to have performed a play for the king and the royal court. One of the first students known was Lars Hjortsberg, who also performed at this occasion and became one of the stars of Swedish theatre history. The school was re-organised in 1793 by Anne Marie Milan Desguillons and her spouse, two actors from the French Theatre in Bollhuset in Stockholm. The students was often used in small parts by the royal theatre and in student performances. The instructors were often actors from the royal theatre.\n\nThe quality of the drama school was considered to be one of Europe's greatest (equivalent to British RADA) and up until 1964 it still featured traditional fencing, ballet-training, plastik (\"plastique\"; body movement and posture on stage), recital- and voice-training (following the same instructions since 1819) and teachings of skilled masking techniques - everything much the same since the 18th Century. The education originally was one year long, but later in the end of the 1910s became two years and later in 1930s extended to three years (as a third year as practising actor at the national stage in its productions was included and compulsory for all).\n\nIn the 1960s, Sweden - as many other countries - was influenced by new theatre traditions; such as method acting and new international thoughts on drama education. The International Theatre Institute arranged several symposia in Europe, which both students and teachers attended and the debate grew. This was also the 1960s and in the early days of the great emerging liberation movement through the world and soon with student revolts all over Europe; it was a time of change in the world of arts and culture, as well as in society in general and in the political debate. The opinion in Sweden was strong to make the acting school a national, non-traditional, independent theatre school governed by the state. The old education and teaching methods were questioned, and it was soon decided by the Swedish government that the school was to be separated from the Royal Dramatic Theatre (aka Dramaten) and become independent.\n\nIt was the then-managing director of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, Ingmar Bergman, who in 1964 initiated the final decision of separation (mostly because he was frustrated that the increasing number of students required more room and deserved more attention than he felt Dramaten could upbring at the time). However, he later came to regret this decision, bitterly calling it (in a late 1990s interview) \"the most stupid thing I've done in my entire life\" as he later felt that the long inherited theatre tradition was completely lost within the Dramaten building. For better or worse can always be debated (what tools and training methods make good actors?); but it's a fact that the students lost contact with the Royal Dramatic Theatre's long tradition, drama history and practising actors (who also regularly had taught at the acting school what other actors/directors once had taught them; and others before them). Looking back, many in Sweden now believe that the 1964 separation definitely affected negatively on the quality of theatre training and acting education in the country; a tradition was lost after 1964 and today many feel that the later national drama educational forms just couldn't quite reach the former standards that the Royal Dramatic Theatre's former acting school presented.\n\nThe last class of Dramatens elevskola was the class of 1967 (whose students enrolled in 1964 and graduated three years later).\n\nFamous students at Dramatens elevskola include: Signe Hasso, Greta Garbo, Gunnar Björnstrand, Ingrid Bergman, Max von Sydow, Stellan Skarsgård, Jan Malmsjö, Nils Asther, Gunn Wållgren, Inga Tidblad, Börje Ahlstedt, Bibi Andersson, Eva Dahlbeck, Ingrid Thulin, Stig Järrel, Gerda Lundequist and Lars Hanson, a.o (including most of the later so called \"Ingmar Bergman-actors\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further information on national Swedish drama education, present and historically, \"see\":\n\n\n"}
{"id": "154076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154076", "title": "Epiphany (feeling)", "text": "Epiphany (feeling)\n\nAn epiphany (from the ancient Greek ἐπιφάνεια, \"epiphaneia\", \"manifestation, striking appearance\") is an experience of a sudden and striking realization. Generally the term is used to describe scientific breakthrough, religious or philosophical discoveries, but it can apply in any situation in which an enlightening realization allows a problem or situation to be understood from a new and deeper perspective. Epiphanies are studied by psychologists and other scholars, particularly those attempting to study the process of innovation.\n\nEpiphanies are relatively rare occurrences and generally follow a process of significant thought about a problem. Often they are triggered by a new and key piece of information, but importantly, a depth of prior knowledge is required to allow the leap of understanding. Famous epiphanies include Archimedes's discovery of a method to determine the density of an object (\"Eureka!\") and Isaac Newton's realization that a falling apple and the orbiting moon are both pulled by the same force.\n\nThe word epiphany originally referred to insight through the divine. Today, this concept is more often used without such connotations, but a popular implication remains that the epiphany is supernatural, as the discovery seems to come suddenly from the outside.\n\nThe word's secular usage may owe much of its popularity to Irish novelist James Joyce. The Joycean epiphany has been defined as \"a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether from some object, scene, event, or memorable phase of the mind — the manifestation being out of proportion to the significance or strictly logical relevance of whatever produces it.\" The author used epiphany as a literary device within each entry of his short story collection \"Dubliners\" (1914); his protagonists came to sudden recognitions that changed their view of themselves and/or their social conditions. Joyce had first expounded on epiphany's meaning in the fragment \"Stephen Hero,\" although this was only published posthumously in 1944. For the philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas, epiphany or a manifestation of the divine is seen in another's face (see face-to-face).\n\nIn traditional and pre-modern cultures, initiation rites and mystery religions have served as vehicles of epiphany, as well as the arts. The Greek dramatists and poets would, in the ideal, induct the audience into states of \"catharsis\" or \"kenosis\", respectively. In modern times an epiphany lies behind the title of William Burroughs' \"Naked Lunch\", a drug-influenced state, as Burroughs explained, \"a frozen moment when everyone sees what is at the end of the fork.\" Both the Dadaist Marcel Duchamp and the Pop Artist Andy Warhol would invert expectations by presenting commonplace objects or graphics as works of fine art (for example a urinal as a fountain), simply by presenting them in a way no one had thought to do before; the result was intended to induce an epiphany of \"what art is\" or is not.\n\nEpiphanies can come in many different forms, and are often generated by a complex combination of experience, memory, knowledge, predisposition and context. A contemporary example of an epiphany in education might involve the process by which a student arrives at some form of new insight or clarifying thought. Despite this popular image, epiphany is the result of significant work on the part of the discoverer, and is only the satisfying result of a long process. The surprising and fulfilling feeling of epiphany is so surprising because one cannot predict when one's labor will bear fruit, and our subconscious can play a significant part in delivering the solution; and is fulfilling because it is a reward for a long period of effort.\n\nA common myth predicts that most, if not all, innovations occur through epiphanies. Not all innovations occur through epiphanies; Scott Berkun notes that \"the most useful way to think of an epiphany is as an occasional bonus of working on tough problems\". Most innovations occur without epiphany, and epiphanies often contribute little towards finding the next one. Crucially, epiphany cannot be predicted, or controlled.\n\nAlthough epiphanies are only a rare occurrence, crowning a process of significant labor, there is a common myth that epiphanies of sudden comprehension are commonly responsible for leaps in technology and the sciences. Famous epiphanies include Archimedes' realization of how to estimate the volume of a given mass, which inspired him to shout \"Eureka!\" (\"I have found it!\"). The biographies of many mathematicians and scientists include an epiphanic episode early in the career, the ramifications of which were worked out in detail over the following years. For example, allegedly Albert Einstein was struck as a young child by being given a compass, and realizing that some unseen force in space was making it move. Another, perhaps better, example from Einstein's life occurred in 1905 after he had spent an evening unsuccessfully trying to reconcile Newtonian physics and Maxwell's equations. While taking a streetcar home, he looked behind him at the receding clocktower in Bern and realized that if the car sped up close to the speed of light, he would see the clock slow down; with this thought, he later remarked, \"a storm broke loose in my mind,\" which would allow him to understand special relativity. Einstein had a second epiphany two years later in 1907 which he called \"the happiest thought of my life\" when he imagined an elevator falling, and realized that a passenger would not be able to tell the difference between the weightlessness of falling, and the weightlessness of space - a thought which allowed him to generalize his theory of relativity to include gravity as a curvature in spacetime. A similar flash of holistic understanding in a prepared mind was said to give Charles Darwin his \"hunch\" (about natural selection), and Darwin later stated that he always remembered the spot in the road where his carriage was when the epiphany struck. Another famous epiphany myth is associated with Isaac Newton's apple story, and yet another with Nikola Tesla's discovery of a workable alternating current induction motor. Though such epiphanies might have occurred, they were almost certainly the result of long and intensive periods of study those individuals had undertaken, rather than an out-of-the-blue flash of inspiration about an issue they had not thought about previously.\n\nAnother myth is that epiphany is simply another word for (usually spiritual) vision. Actually, realism and psychology make epiphany a different mode as distinguished from vision, even though both vision and epiphany are often triggered by (sometimes seemingly) irrelevant incidents or objects.\n\nIn Christianity, the Epiphany refers to a realization that Christ is the Son of God. Western churches generally celebrate the Visit of the Magi as the revelation of the Incarnation of the infant Christ, and commemorate the Feast of the Epiphany on January 6. Traditionally, Eastern churches, following the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar, have celebrated Epiphany (or Theophany) in conjunction with Christ's baptism by John the Baptist and celebrated it on January 19; however, other Eastern churches have adopted the Western Calendar and celebrate it on January 6. Some Protestant churches often celebrate Epiphany as a season, extending from the last day of Christmas until either Ash Wednesday, or the Feast of the Presentation on February 2.\n\nIn more general terms, the phrase \"religious epiphany\" is used when a person realizes their faith, or when they are convinced that an event or happening was really caused by a deity or being of their faith. In Hinduism, for example, epiphany might refer to Arjuna's realization that Krishna (incarnation of God serving as his charioteer in the \"Bhagavad Gita\") is indeed representing the Universe. The Hindu term for epiphany would be bodhodaya, from Sanskrit bodha 'wisdom' and udaya 'rising'. Or in Buddhism, the term might refer to the Buddha obtaining enlightenment under the bodhi tree, finally realizing the nature of the universe, and thus attaining Nirvana. The Zen term \"kensho\" also describes this moment, referring to the feeling attendant on realizing the answer to a \"koan\".\n\n"}

{"id": "32551591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32551591", "title": "French Film Festival UK", "text": "French Film Festival UK\n\nThe French Film Festival UK (also named FFF UK) is an association founded in 1992. The association was first based in Edinburgh and Glasgow, before spreading to other parts of the United Kingdom. The Festival takes place generally between November and the beginning of December, with a programme of French or French-language movies (films, shorts, documentary, animations, etc.).\n\nThe festival began during Britain's presidency of the EC and was one of the artistic events initiated when Edinburgh hosted the Euro-summit in 1992. It was created on the initiative of two film journalists Richard Mowe and Allan Hunter who ran the festival in tandem for a number of years. Hunter now has relinquished the reins to concentrate on other activities, including the Glasgow Film Festival and the Italian Film Festival UK, both of which he is a co-director. Mowe is now director of the French Film Festival UK, co-director of the Italian Film Festival UK and director of the distribution company CinéFile as well as continuing his journalistic activities. Ilona Morison now has joined the FFF UK team as deputy director.\n\nIt was the year of Josiane Balasko, Gérard Jugnot, Indochine, Madame Bovary and then newcomer Arnaud Desplechin's La Vie des morts. The Air France photographic archive was on show.\n\nJean Reno's mega-hit time-travelling comedy \"Les Visiteurs\" hit these shores to great success although the Festival would have to wait a few years for Reno himself to appear. Instead actor Christine Bujeau appeared in his place. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau came and conquered with Cyrano de Bergerac and other films in his canon; there was Bertrand Blier's Un, deux, trois soleil; Coline Serreau's \"La Crise\" (including a special screening and dinner in the Royal Museum of Scotland for sponsors Paribas) and a special focus on Claude Chabrol. The festival introduced Cédric Klapisch to the British public with \"Riens du tout\". A link was forged with the Brest European Short Film Festival ensuring a selection of new French short films. Jeanne Moreau and Claude Sautet sent messages of support.\n\nThe Festival have brought Michel Deville and \"Aux petits bonheurs\", Gérard Jugnot back again this time with \"Casque Bleu\"; The César winning Tonie Marshall was discovered with \"Pas très catholique\" as well as Philippe Lioret and his audience award-winner \"Tombés du ciel\". Antoine Desrosières, a young directorial Turk, brought his youthful protagonists Mathieu Demy and Aurélie Thierrée and \"A la belle étoile\". The Harcourt Studio's photographic archives were on show.\n\nIt was the year of Mathieu Kassovitz whom we introduced to the UK long before \"La Haine\" thrust him into the spotlight; Claude Lelouch was among the guests with Alessandra Martines; Josiane Balasko appeared on screen with Gazon Maudit; Hervé Palud and Louis Becker accompanied \"Un indien dans la ville\" and a test audience of youngsters gave their verdicts on dubbed and subtitled versions. Marion Vernoux was another discovery for \"Personne ne m'aime\". Bernard Stora won the audience award for \"Consentement Mutuel\" and Patrick Braoudé enchanted with the original \"Neuf mois\". We celebrated 100 years of Gaumont in a poster show.\n\nThe grande dame of French cinema, Agnès Varda received a retrospective in her honour and in her presence. Patrice Leconte launched \"Les grands ducs\". Gabriel Aghion camped it up with \"Pédale douce\" … Michel Serrault and Carmen Maura discovered \"Le bonheur est dans le pré\" and pupils went to school with \"Le maître des éléphants\" with special screenings for teachers and their charges. Abel Gance's monumental \"La Roue\" featured a live score by Adrian Johnston. A restored copy of \"Jour de fête\" gave Jacques Tati a new lease of life. Didier Bourdon clowned around in \"Les trois frères\" and in person. And there were new films from Pascale Ferran, Agnès Merlet and Tonie Marshall.\n\nThe real-life Lucie Aubrac made a heart-rending appearance in support of Claude Berri's Resistance epic. Bernard Giraudeau presented his breathtaking \"Les caprices d'un fleuve\" and screenwriter Éric Assous discussed his scripts for \"La femme défendu\" and \"Les Randonnneurs\". We discovered Robert Guédiguian long before Marius et Jeanette with \"A la vie, à la mort\" – and on screen there was Godard, Kassovitz and Klapisch, Michel Piccoli made his directorial debut, Alain Chabat showed dogged determination with Didier and Philippe Muyl's \"Tout doît disparaître\". Jan Kounen delivered Dobermann while Pascale Ferran and Pierre Trividic presented \"Petit arrangements avec les morts\".\n\nClaude and Annie Miller presented \"La classe de neige\" and other landmark films including \"La meilleure façon de marcher\", \"Garde à vue\", \"Le Sourire\", and \"L'éffrontée\". Antoine de Caunes showed his serious side in \"L'homme est une femme comme les autres\" and was present with actress Elsa Zylberstein. Patrice Chéreau also took the plane to talk about \"Ceux qui m'aiment prendront le train\". The classic choice of René Clair's \"Un chapeau de paille d'italie\" was accompanied by a live score by Ramond Alessandrini. Patrice Leconte launched \"Une chance sur deux\" at its London premiere and Betrand Tavernier made a lasting impression with \"Capitaine Conan\". Francis Veber caused ripples of laughter with \"Le dîner de cons\", subsequently a huge box office hit. Danièle Doubroux tantalised with \"Le journal du séducteur\" – and there were startling debuts by Jean-François Richet (\"Ma 6T va crack-er\"), Sébastien Lifshitz with Les corps ouverts, Olivier Dahan with \"Déjà mort\" and Laurent Bouhnik with \"Zonzon\". Claude Duty brought his shorts.\n\nTime to vive la différence: women film-makers were ready for their close-ups, among them Anne Fontaine, Valérie Lemercier, Brigitte Rouan, Diane Kurys and Danièle Dubroux – all were guests except Kurys. Jean Renoir's \"La carrosse d'or\" gleamed anew in a restored print. Michel Deville returned to form with \"La maladie de Sachs\" and first film talents included Smadi Wolfman, director Olivier Péray and producer David Kodsi (all guests) with Petits désordres amoureux as well as Stéphane Brizé, Didier Le Pêcheur and Christine Carrière. Alain Beigel (guest) revealed the talents of Emma de Caunes in \"Milles bornes\" – and accompanied his first feature, one of the year's most refreshing debuts.\n\nBertrand Blier gathered together a who's who of French stars for \"Les acteurs\" and came to talk about them. We took a special look at les thrillers with such acclaimed titles as: \"Scènes de crimes\" (Frédéric Schoendoerffer) with Charles Berling, and André Dussollier; \"Le cousin\" (Alain Corneau) starring Alain Chabat, Patrick Timsit, and Marie Trintignant; \"Au coeur du mensonge / The Colour of Lies\" (Claude Chabrol) starring Jacques Gamblin, Sandrine Bonnaire, Antoine de Caunes and Valéria Bruni-Tedeschi; Total Western / The Hunted Man (guest Eric Rochant) starring Samuel Le Bihan, Jean-François Stévenin and Jean-Pierre Kalfon; as well as Une affaire du goût / A tasteful affair (Bernard Rapp) introduced by actor Jean-Pierre Lorît. Isabelle Huppert starred in three Les destinées sentimentales (Olivier Assayas) and in contemporary roles in two films by Benoît Jacquôt L'ecole de chair and Pas de scandale. Là-bas … mon pays / Over There … My Country (Alexandre Arcady) took a fresh look at Algeria with Antoine de Caunes playing a celebrated television journalist while Le vache et le président (Philippe Muyl, also a guest) proved a delightful film for young people about a boy's bid to save his favourite cow and was scene by thousands of school children. Other guest included Anne Villaceque for Petite Cherie, and Sabine Franel for Le premier du nom. A new company CinéFrance was established to continue the pioneering work of the festival throughout the year, and to date has released successfully Au coeur du mensonge and La vache et le président with more titles pending.\n\nThe return of Josiane Balasko for \"Un crime au paradis\"; Jean-Pierre Salomé for \"Belphégor\"; Claude Miller for \"Betty Fisher\"; Thierry Lhermitte for \"Le prince du pacifique\"; Lucy Russell for \"L'anglaise et le duc\"; Thomas Gilou for \"La vérité 1 and 2\"; Mehdi Charef for \"Marie-Line\"; Fabrice Genestal for \"La Squale\"; Yves Lavandier for \"Oui mais …\" and Anne-Sophie Birot and Islid Lo Besco for \"Les filles ne savent pas nager\"; Christian Carion for \"Une hirondelle a fait le printemps\" and Pierre-Olivier Scotto and Thierry de Ganay for \"Le roman de Lulu\". Lynda Benahouada and Mohamed Chaouch attended to support Samia.\n\nSerge le Peron for Léaud l'unique; Patrice Leconte for L'homme du train; Olivier Dahan for Le peit poucet and La vie promise; Éric Berger for Tanguy; Etienne Chatiliez for Tanguy (in London); Agnes Obadia and Jean-Julien Chervier for Du poil sous les roses; Nicolas Philibert retro at the French Institute, Edinburgh.\n\nThe FFF offered a substantial retrospective – devoted to the work of Alain Corneau in his presence which also helped to \"grow\" the festival's influence as some screenings started in October in the run-up to the festival itself which ran from 7 to 30 November. In Glasgow the Corneau retrospective found a home at the CCA, adding yet another venue to the line-up while the Ciné Lumière devoted a weekend to the retro. In Edinburgh and Glasgow, the festival's founding cities, the response to the overall programme which embraced work by Claude Miller, Claude Chabrol, Jean Becker, Raoul Ruiz, Philippe Muyle, Jeanne Labrune, Michel Deville, Robert Guédiguian and Danièle Thompson among many, proved pleasingly buoyant and maintained the growing momentum seen over the last couple of years. Stirling Macrobert were cautiously upbeat about the participation on four titles. Sidebar activity included the stunning exhibition of photographs by Nicolas Guerin, a photographer who works for Positif, shown at the French Institute in Edinburgh and on the walls of GFT's Café Cosmo; a round table on literary adaptations in the cinema featuring Franco-Scottish input from Bernard MacLaverty, Alain Corneau and Leslie Hills at the French Institute where additional attractions included a programme of documentaries on writers as well as four portraits of directors Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Claire Denis, Jean-Jacques Beineix and Robert Guédiguian. Again the level of activity built on initiatives started in previous years. One of the resounding causes for optimism was the positive reaction to the educational programme (Moi César, Le Papillon and Vivre me tue) which proved popular with pupils, students and teachers. The strong opening weekend (and closing at London Ciné Lumière) with many guests in attendance including Alain Corneau, Nadine Trintingnant, Jean Veber, Nicolas Vannier, and Nicolas Guerin, ensured that the festival had a vibrant send-off and produced vibes that resonated over the days ahead. Distribution of guests ensured that Dundee (Jean and Louis Becker) and Aberdeen (Thomas Chabrol) shared in the bounty.\n\nThe star appearance in Glasgow of Jean Reno, created a storm of interest. Guests appeared variously in London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh and included Gael Morel for Le Clan, Dominique Cabrera for Folle embellie, Abelllatif Kechiche for L'esquive, and Emmanuel Mouret for Venus et fleur. Consul general Pierre Antoine-Berniard hosted an agreeable brunch at his residence and guests of honour included director Gael Morel, Unifrance's Antoine Khalife, Sylvain and Sally Chomet, Scottish director Richard Jobson, Palme Dog promoter Toby Rose and others including the French Institute's Olga Poivre d'Arvor. Education events surrounded Les choristes, Malabar Princess, Genesis and Raining Cats and Frogs. Special teaching packs were devised by Glasgow Film Theatre's learning team in collaboration with local authorities. Such events are becoming an increasingly important of FFF activities, with teachers demonstrating an unprecedented demand and interest. The tribute to Alain Delon whose image adorned the cover of the brochure, drummed up a strong following for La Piscine, Mr Klein and Melodie en sous sol.\n\nThere was a mini-celebration of le cinema francais to enable the French Film Festival UK to change calendar dates and to join forces in 2006 with the Renault French Film Season to become an all-encompassing showcase for French cinema in the UK. Titles presented comprised: Afiter You / Après vous; Just Friends / je préfère qu’on reste amis; The Art of Breaking Up / Un fil a la patte and The Ax / Le Couperet. Sadly the collaboration was short-lived and in 2007 the Festival regained its traditional November slot.\n\nThe year of the collaboration with the Renault French Film Season. The Panorama section of the Festival was devoted to titles featuring such big name stars as Carole Bouquet, Sandrine Bonnaire, Sabine Azéma, and, from the younger generation, Romain Duris and Audrey Tautou. Themes range from school rebellion (Bad Spelling, to be released by CineFile), a right royal romp which has already had considerable coverage over here (Palais Royal!, Momentum Pictures) and 1968 revolutionary fervour (Regular Lovers, Artificial Eye). Cutting-edge, new talent is celebrated in the Discovery section. Xavier Giannoli's An Adventure (Momentum Pictures) depicts a strange psychological encounter between Ludivine Sagnier and Nicolas Duvauchelle, while Mon Ange (Parasol Peccadillo) features Vanessa Paradis in her first screen role for six years, playing a hooker with a heart of gold who suddenly finds her world turned upside down. Master Classes, open to all, were scheduled with Bertrand Tavernier, the subject of the 2006 retrospective. As someone who has carved his own unique niche in French cinema as a dedicated cinéphile, producer, script-writer, and director, Tavernier has won countless international awards for his work which will be discussed at public events in London, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee. He will also present his latest film Holy Lola with Jacques Gamblin and Isabelle Carré plus the cult hit Death Watch, made in Glasgow with Romy Schneider and Harvey Keitel. The festival is presided over by honorary patron Sylvain Chomet, the Oscar-nominated creator of Belleville Rendez-vous currently working on this side of the Channel – another example of Franco-British fusion in action. There were three launches – in Edinburgh (Cockles and Muscles with Jacques Martineau and Olivier Ducastel), Glasgow (Lemming with Dominik Moll) and London (Le Temps qui reste) with Melvil Poupaud. Russian Dolls had its London bow at the Cineworld Shaftesbury Avenue followed by Bertrand Tavernier's masterclass and screening of Holy Lola. The delegation comprised, among others, Marie Gillain, Melvil Poupaud, Dominik Moll, Cédric Klapisch, Olivier Marchal, Bertrand Tavernier, Olivier Ducastel, Jacques Martineau, Edouard Colin, as well as Jacques Bonnaffé and Aisa Maiga (the latter low profile pair had least to contribute to the proceedings being secondary characters in their respective films Cockles and Russian Dolls).\n\nAfter a year of close collaboration with Unifrance and the showcase in London designed to promote films with UK distribution in place, it was agreed that the two events should regain their separate identities in 2007. The policy change within Unifrance was communicated relatively late in the planning of the FFF UK 2007 leaving the 15th edition of the festival locked in to dates from 15 April to 6 May (not necessarily the ideal timeframe) while the Rendezvous ran earlier from 29 March to 1 April and was based only in London. The FFF UK welcomed a range of guests including Christian Vincent, the subject of this year's retro. He attended screenings in three cities (London, Edinburgh, Glasgow) as well as taking part in masterclasses at Screen Academy Scotland in Edinburgh and at the Alliance française in Glasgow. Another three-city guest was director Patrick Grandperret who presented his new film Meurtrières / Murderers. Michel Hazanavicius, the director of OSS 117 attended with actress Bérénice Béjo – and took part in two screenings at Filmhouse Edinburgh and Vue Ocean Terminal. Unfortunately they had to cut their Glasgow date because of a funeral in France. The final attendee was Claudie Ossard, one of France's most powerful producers (Amélie / Betty Blue / Delicatessen) who presented her new production Paris je t'aime with FFF UK patron Sylvain Chomet (director of one of the segments). She used the occasion to talk shop with Chomet about their new live-action feature project.\n\nThe introduction of a Preview section devoted to showcasing films with UK distribution already in place (as a way of filling the gap left by the demise of the 2008 Unifrance London Rendezvous) also produced dividends. In particular the take-up for Priceless (top performer) and A Secret. The line-up of guests included Lola Doillon attending the openings in Edinburgh and Glasgow with her first film Just About Love, Jean Becker and Jean-Pierre Darroussin supporting Conversations with My Gardener in Scotland and London, and Lebanese film-maker Danielle Arbid in attendance for A Lost Man. Daroussin and also accompanied The Premonition, his first film as a director with actress Valerie Stroh. Lionel Bailliu worked tirelessly at master classes built around his feature Fair Play and his short film Squash at Screen Academy Scotland and Stirling University as well as the Alliance Française in Glasgow. London additionally welcomed Pierre Salvadori, Serge Bozon and Barbara Carlotti, and Damien Odoul. The only guest who failed to appear was Melvil Poupaud, who had to return at the last moment to the States for re-shoots on his new film. Award-winning photographer Fabrizio Maltese appeared in Edinburgh and Glasgow to publicise his exhibition Faces of French Cinema at the Institut franìais. He was accompanied by his editor Boyd van Hoeij.\n\nThe 17th edition featured two contrasting tributes to diverse but legendary figures: Jacques Tati and Jean Eustache. A new documentary The Magnificent Tati premiered in Edinburgh and Glasgow, presented by its director Michael House while Tati expert Professor David Bellos from Princeton University introduced all major screenings of Tati's oeuvres. The focus on Jean Eustache, curated by Edinburgh University, was presented by Eustache expert Jerome Game and Professor Keith Reader from Glasgow University. Panorama gathered titles featuring the crème de la crème of French stars among them Gérard Depardieu, Nathalie Baye, Josiane Balasko, Catherine Frot, André Dussollier, Gérard Jugnot, Jean-Pierre Darroussin, Fabrice Luchini, Chiara Mastroianni, and Emmanuel Mouret as well as a clin d'oeil on novelist Françoise Sagan. The Discovery section, among a wide selection, showcased Guillaume Depardieu's final moving performance and an arresting new Swiss film Another Man whose director Lionel Baier was in attendance with the support of the cultural department of the Swiss Embassy. Director and sailor Pierre Marcel presented his documentary Tabarly (the Gallic master mariner Eric Tabarly). Top French titles due on UK screens later in that year included the Cannes Film Festival award winner A Prophet by Jacques Audiard and Welcome by Philippe Lioret. In addition to regular cities (Glasgow, Edinburgh, London, Manchester, Warwick, Aberdeen, Inverness, Dundee) we welcomed to the fold Dumfries, Durham, Cambridge, St Andrews and Stirling. The Rhône-Alpes region around Lyon active in film locations, tourism and commerce held a special gala evening as part of the celebration.\n\nThe festival welcomed more than 20,000 spectators. An even wider geographical selection was on offer through the addition of the Horizons label, warmly embracing the world of Francophonie and its varied cultures thanks to the input of TV5 Monde. After the memorable Jacques Tati tribute and retrospective in 2009 the festival maintained the link by focussing on the work of Pierre Étaix in his presence and in particular the restored copy of Le grand amour. With his roots in the circus, he helped Tati on many of his films, developed multiple skills and carved his own film career working with everyone from Robert Bresson to Jerry Lewis. A close-up on a key figure in French cinema, André Techiné whose concerns have involved identity, sexuality and roots, was mounted in association with Stirling University's Bill Marshall. The new films cover titles from major directors such as Bertrand Tavernier, Rachid Bouchareb, Jean-Jacques Beineix and Costa-Gavras, to the newer generation of Christophe Honoré, Stephane Brizé, Cédric Kahn, and Zabou Breitman.\n\nDaniel Auteuil supported in person his remake Marcel Pagnol's classic The Well-Digger's Daughter (as actor and director) while Daniel Armogathe, President of the Marseille Cinematheque shared his Pagnol insights at screenings of the film in Edinburgh and Glasgow, part of a delegation from Marseille. Following the previous recent celebrations of Jacques Tati and, in 2010, Pierre Étaix, we saluted in their presence a Belgian burlesque duo in the same tradition Fiona Gordon and Dominique Abel and their Cannes hit The Fairy. The Belgian flag also was flown by Bouli Lanners (The Giants) and Dominique Reding's Robert Mitchum is Dead, all organised by Edouard Notte, lecturer in French language and literature at Edinburgh University in collaboration with WBI (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Francophone Community). The delightful opening choice of Romantics Anonymous starring Isabelle Carré and Benoît Poelvoorde was directed by Jean-Pierre Améris who accompanied his film at most screenings. There were superb documentaries such as Oceans, Special Flight, Think Global and a portrait of Charlotte Rampling (The Look) through animation (Zep's colourful Titeuf and A Cat in Paris) to significant new works by Alain Cavalier, André Techiné, Philippe Claudel, Danielle Arbid (who accompanied her controversial Beirut Hotel) as well as The Women on the 6th Floor's Philippe Le Guay. Scots actor Jamie Sives demonstrated the Auld Alliance in action and teamed up with director Vincent Vizioz for Temblay-en-France.\n\nClassic cinema was not neglected with Jean Delannoy's collaboration with Jean Cocteau Love Eternal and Fantomas by Louis Feuillade, the first great master of feature-length film-making, accompanied with a live electronic score by two cult Parisian DJs Jean-Yves Leloup and Éric Pajot (aka RadioMentale) in Dundee and The Hippodrome, Bo'ness.\n\nThe 20th Anniversary of the festival between 8 November and 2 December in over 12 cities including London, Edinburgh and Paris.\nThe guests of the festival were: Chantal Akerman, Pierre Jolivet, Eric Lange, Sophie Lellouche, François Pirot and Noémie Lvovsky with a piano recital by Jason Kouchak held at the ambassadors residence in Paris.\nThis year, the festival has screened in preview the movie \"Asterix and Obelix: On Her Majesty\" with great actors like Gérard Depardieu, Catherine Deneuve, Dany Boon or Valérie Lemercier. A retro was made in honor of Chantal Akerman and his film Almayer's Folly. The Horizons unveiled panorama feature films like \"All Our Desires\" by Philippe Lioret, \"My Worst Nightmare\" Anne Fontaine with Benoit Poelvoorde or \"Happiness never comes alone\" with Sophie Marceau. \"Under Discovery\", \"Headwinds of Lespert\" or first name Mathieu Delaporte and Alexandre de Patellière were broadcast. There was a special Quebec Cinema Showcase that highlights Québec film culture. The animated films \"The Suicide Shop\" and \"Ernest and Celestine\" made strong impression. While a classic item made rediscover old films such as \"Borsalino\" with Jean-Paul Belmondo.\n\nThe guests of this edition were: Anouk Aimée, Daniel Auteuil, Jean-Pierre Améris, Sylvain Chomet, Gregory Monro, Benazeth Catherine and Yolande Moreau. A slideshow is dedicated specifically to the immortal Louis de Funès and his films such as The crossing of Paris of Claude Autant-Lara and the megalomania of Gérard Oury. The Horizons panorama made discover films like capital with Gad Elmaleh, or The Man Who Laughs with Gérard Depardieu. The view was also discover a beautiful hilarious movie \"Me, Myself and Mum\" featuring the incredible personable actor- director Guillaume Galienne.\n\nThis year, the Horizons panorama in the brochure included the hit movie \"Belle and Sebastian\" by Nicolas Vanier or he tells the friendship between a boy and a dog, all our strength From Nils Tavernier or man that is loved too with Guillaume Canet by André Téchiné . The section contains the Discovery Domestic Life Isabelle Czajka Heirs of Marie- Castille Mention – Schaar or even Alone with François Cluzet. The animated portion still has its success this time Day of the Crows by Jean-Christophe Dessaint or Loulou, the incredible secret of Gregory by Eric Omond Solotareff. A tribute to World War I was done with different films on this theme.\n\nOfficial site: http://frenchfilmfestival.org.uk/FFF2012/wp / French Film Festival\n"}
{"id": "2033364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2033364", "title": "Fruit Basket Turnover", "text": "Fruit Basket Turnover\n\nFruit Basket Turnover or Fruit Basket Upset, also known as Fruit Salad, Fruit Bowl, Fruits Basket and others is a children's game.\n\nFruit Basket usually refers to a variation in which each fruit is ostensibly associated with only one player, and the player in the centre must call two fruit names.\n\nThe game is played as follows:\n\n\nIn some variants of the game, a player can be eliminated from the game, usually if they either fail to move when their fruit name is called, or are due to appear in the centre for two rounds in a row. Whenever a player is eliminated, a chair is also removed from the circle. The game resembles a combination of the games Musical Chairs and Duck Duck Goose.\n\nIn an outdoor version of the game, the players stand along the side of a large open area, and must run from one side to the other without being tagged when their fruit, or 'turnover', is called. Any player who is caught by the player in the middle must join the player in the middle to help catch players on future moves. Eventually, all players are caught.\n\nA variation of the game, played by older children and young adults, does not make use of fruit names. Instead, the player in the centre calls out the description of a group of people (for example, \"women\", \"people who have been to Kansas\", etc.) and all people in that group are required to move. The only limit on this is that the person in the centre must be a member of the specified group (e.g., only a woman may call on \"women\" to move).\n\nThe most well-known reference in Western youth culture to Fruits Basket is the anime and manga series of the same name, where it is used as a metaphor for ability to integrate with a social group. In that series, the protagonist Tohru Honda describes that whenever she played the game in school, she was assigned the name \"onigiri\" (rice ball). Although she was fine with this, she later realized that the other children playing never called this name because an onigiri is not a fruit and didn't belong in a fruits basket, thus leaving her sitting as they continued to play. However, at the end of episode 5, when she is accepted into the Sohma family, we see one child call \"onigiri!\" and, smiling, Tohru joins in the game. The series title itself originates from the fact that Tohru previously thought that she could never actually fit in with the Sohma family, just as a rice ball could never belong in a fruits basket, but, being accepted into the family proves otherwise, and she learns that she has a home with them.\n\nThe anime Mitsudomoe makes reference to the game in episode 1 of season 1 but is portrayed in a violent yet humorous way.\n\n"}

The book was severely criticized by academics upon its publication.\n\nThe main argument of the book may be summarized as the claim of an early (Neolithic) discovery of the precession of the equinoxes (usually attributed to Hipparchus, 2nd century BCE), and an associated very long-lived Megalithic civilization of \"unsuspected sophistication\" that was particularly preoccupied with astronomical observation.\nThe knowledge of this civilization about precession, and the associated astrological ages,\nwould have been encoded in mythology, typically in the form of a story relating to a millstone and a young protagonist—the \"Hamlet's Mill\" of the book's title, a reference to the kenning \" Amlóða kvren\" recorded in the Old Icelandic \"Skáldskaparmál\".\nThe authors indeed claim that mythology is primarily to be interpreted as in terms of archaeoastronomy (\"mythological language has exclusive reference to celestial phenomena\"), and they mock alternative interpretations in terms of fertility or agriculture.\n\nThe book's project is an examination of the \"relics, fragments and allusions that have survived the steep attrition of the ages\". \nIn particular, the book reconstructs a myth of a heavenly mill which rotates around the celestial pole and grinds out the world's salt and soil, and is associated with the maelstrom. The millstone falling off its frame represents the passing of one age's pole star (symbolized by a ruler or king of some sort), and its restoration and the overthrow of the old king of authority and the empowering of the new one the establishment of a new order of the age (a new star moving into the position of pole star). \nThe authors attempt to demonstrate the prevalence of influence of this hypothetical civilization's ideas by analysing the world's mythology (with an eye especially to all \"mill myths\") using \nSantillana and Dechend state in their introduction to \"Hamlet's Mill\" that they are well aware of modern interpretations of myth and folklore but find them shallow and lacking insight: \"...the experts now are benighted by the current folk fantasy, which is the belief that they are beyond all this - critics without nonsense and extremely wise\". Consequently, Santillana and Dechend prefer to rely on the work of \"meticulous scholars such as Ideler, Lepsius, Chwolson, Boll and, to go farther back, of Athanasius Kircher and Petavius...\"\n\nThey give reasons throughout the book for preferring the work of older scholars (and the early mythologists themselves) as the proper way to interpret myth; but this viewpoint did not sit well with their modern critics schooled in the \"current anthropology, which has built up its own idea of the primitive and what came after\".\n\nSantillana had previously published, in 1961, \"The Origins of Scientific Thought\", on which \"Hamlet's Mill\" is substantially based. Compare various statements in \"Hamlet's Mill\" to this quotation from \"The Origin of Scientific Thought\": \"We can see then, how so many myths, fantastic and arbitrary in semblance, of which the Greek tale of the Argonaut is a late offspring, may provide a terminology of image motifs, a kind of code which is beginning to be broken. It was meant to allow those who knew (a) to determine unequivocally the position of given planets in respect to the earth, to the firmament, and to one another; (b) to present what knowledge there was of the fabric of the world in the form of tales about 'how the world began'.\"\n\n\"Hamlet's Mill\" was severely criticized by academic reviewers on a number of grounds: tenuous arguments based on incorrect or outdated linguistic information; lack of familiarity with modern sources; an over-reliance on coincidence or analogy; and the general implausibility of a far-flung and influential civilization existing and not leaving behind solid evidence. At most, it has been given a grudging sort of praise. Thus, Jaan Puhvel (1970) concluded that\nWriting in \"The New York Review of Books\", Edmund Leach noted:\nH. R. Ellis Davidson referred to \"Hamlet’s Mill\" as:\nIn contrast the classical scholar Harald Reiche positively reviewed \"Hamlet's Mill\". Reiche was a colleague of Santillana at MIT, and himself developed the archaeoastronomical interpretation of ancient myth in a series of lectures and publications similar to \"Hamlet's Mill\" (dealing more specifically with Greek mythology), including an interpretation of \"the layout of Atlantis as a sort of map of the sky\".\n\nThe Swedish astronomer Peter Nilson, while recognizing that \"Hamlet's Mill\" does not qualify as a work of science, expressed admiration for it as well as it being a source of inspiration when he wrote his own book on classic mythologies based on the night sky: \"Himlavalvets sällsamheter\" (1977).\n\nBarber & Barber (2006), itself a study aiming to \"uncover seismic, geological, astrological, or other natural events\" from mythology, appreciates the book for its pioneer work in mythography, judging that \"Although controversial, <nowiki>[Santillana and von Dechend]</nowiki> have usefully flagged and collected Herculean amounts of relevant data.\" Nevertheless, the conclusions the authors draw from their data have been \"virtually ignored by the scientific and scholarly establishment.”\n\nThe full hardcover title is \"Hamlet's Mill: An Essay on Myth & the Frame of Time\". Later softcover editions would use \"Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge and its Transmission Through Myth\". \nThe English edition was hastily assembled and published five years prior to Santillana's death. \nHertha von Dechend (who is generally held to have written more of the book) prepared an expanded second edition several years later. \nThe essay was reissued by David R. Godine, Publisher in 1992. The German translation, which appeared in 1993, is slightly longer than the original. The 8th Italian edition of 2000 was substantially expanded.\n\n\n\n"}

The studio has - to this date - produced two films, \"A Wicked Tale\" and \"e’Tzaintes\", both of which premièred to critical acclaim in the international film festival circuit. The studio’s mission is to create a platform for writers, storytellers, musicians and film-makers to come together to present alternative art forms to mainstream audiences. Their Mantra – To Provoke the Senses and Open the Mind.\n\nINRI studio was a concept that came about in 1999 when Tzang Merwyn Tong and long time friend Armen Rizal Rahman, an aspiring musician, decide that it was time they band together to create a production company they can call their own. They roped in Lee Amizadai and together the unit identified themselves as INRI studio.\n\nThe trio went on to make their very first film together. Using their scrap earnings and savings that they have accumulated over the years, the team of film-makers started work on their first film \"e’Tzaintes\". The film’s a teenage black comedy about a bunch of social outcasts. It was a project that took them 3 years to complete.\n\nThe film was a hit when it premièred at GV Grand at Great World City in Singapore on January 2003. Tickets to this independent première were completely sold out with people even paying to sit on the aisles.\n\n\"e’Tzaintes\" went to travel to a couple of film festivals. It premièred in Europe in 2004 as the Opening Night Film of the Berlin Asia-Pacific Film Festival and was screened as part of the Asian New Force at the Hong Kong IFVA Festival.\n\nThe studio then embarked on their second film, \"A Wicked tale\", starring Evelyn Maria Ng as the Little Red Riding Hood character in Tzang Merwyn Tong’s dark re-imagination of the Brothers Grimm fable. The film made its World Premiere to a full house crowd at the Rotterdam International Film Festival and was later invited to FanTasia Film Festival to be screened as one of the Closing Night films. The movie won the Gold Remi Award at WorldFest in Houston. On December 2005, INRI studio made history by being the first short film in Singapore to be released commercially on DVD.\n\nThe INRI studio collective now consists of artists, writers, musicians and filmmakers coming together to explore new ways of how they can take things to the next level. An underground music project is currently in the pipeline.\n\nThe word INRI is inspired by the inscription on the cross from which Jesus Christ was crucified. INRI is a Latin acronym for Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum (literally translated as Jesus of Nazareth King of Jews). The letters can be found inscribed on a stylized plaque (or parchment) hanging just above the corpse of Christ on many depictions of the Crucifixion.\n\nContrary to belief, the use of the name INRI is neither religious nor sacrilegious. Tzang Merwyn is known to be a big fan of mythology and he considers the crucifixion a romantic and inspiring historic parable.\n\nIt’s a story about a man (assumed by many as a heretic) who refuses to deny accusations that he was the Saviour even though he was about to be nailed to the cross. The story is symbolical of the kind sacrifice one has to make to stage a revolution, and the letters, INRI, a reminder to Tzang and his team mates that mockery and ridicule awaits those who choose to do things differently.\n\n\n\n"}

In the game, initially known as \"Project Totem\", players must move pieces of a totem pole through various levels while avoiding obstacles. The name comes from the music sample kalimba by mr scruff in windows versions.\n\nA noble shaman on the island of Kalimba protects her people through a mystic totem pole. When an evil shaman destroys both the good shaman and the totem pole, she discovers that her spirit can control pieces of the totem and plans to use that ability to save the island's inhabitants by building a new, stronger totem pole.\n\nThe player controls two colored pieces of the totem pole simultaneously; when the player moves one piece in a given direction, the second piece copies the action. The totem pieces may pass safely through anything that matches their own color, but otherwise must avoid all enemies and pitfalls. If a piece is lost through contact with an enemy or other obstacle, both pieces are lost, but the pieces reset to the most recently passed checkpoint. As players advance, they collect items scattered throughout the level. Upon completion of the level, points are scored for each item collected, but are reduced by the number of times the pieces were lost. The completed level unlocks a totem piece that also serves to rank the player's performance in that level. Levels may be replayed in order to improve both score and time of completion.\n\nIn cooperative mode, each player controls a pair of totem pieces of the same color. Playing through a different set of levels from the single-player mode, players must work together to arrange their pieces in ways to complete the levels. Scoring and ranking are otherwise the same as the single-player version.\n\nFirst announced in April 2014 as \"Project Totem\", \"Kalimba\" was developed by Press Play, a Danish gaming studio that was acquired in 2012 by Microsoft Studios. In November 2014, the name was changed to \"Kalimba\" officially and a release date of December 17, 2014 was announced for Xbox One, with a Windows PC release planned for January 2015. At the initial announcement, Press Play mentioned that the game would also be released on Xbox 360, but after the release date for Xbox One was announced, Press Play said, \"while there are plans to hopefully bring Kalimba to [Xbox] 360 in the future, there's nothing concrete in the works at the moment.\"\n\nIn April 2015, Press Play announced the official release date of the PC version of \"Kalimba\", which was released on Steam April 22, 2015. They further announced an update to both versions that would add two new gameplay modes along with a DLC expansion that added new single-player and co-op levels to the game. One of the new modes allows single players to speedrun the levels and compete against ghosts of other players, while the second mode introduces new challenges for co-op play. The new game modes are free to all users, and users can purchase the additional levels either individually (single-player or co-op) or in a discounted bundle; current Xbox One players can obtain the DLC at no additional charge for a limited time.\n\"Kalimba\" has received generally positive reviews. Reviewers have complimented the game on its concept and the fun of playing the game cooperatively, but have said that the game's graphics and sounds are ultimately \"forgettable\". The game was both nominated and shortlisted for a 2015 BAFTA award in the 'Best Original Property' category.\n"}

In 2006, Gene Luen Yang's graphic novel \"American Born Chinese\", originally published as a webcomic on Modern Tales, was the first graphic novel to be nominated for a National Book Award. Don Hertzfeldt's animated film based on his webcomics, \"Everything Will Be OK\", won the 2007 Sundance Film Festival Jury Award in Short Filmmaking, a prize rarely bestowed on an animated film.\n\nWebcomic artists have also won comic awards from organizations that generally honor print comics, such as the Ignatz Awards and Eisner Awards, and there are awards, such as the Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards, which are given only to webcomics. \n\nFrom 2001 until 2008, the Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards were given out, with voting rights granted only to online cartoonists. Because of the large number of categories, such as \"Best Art\", \"Best Writing\", \"Best Gag Comic\" and \"Best Newcomer\", only the winners of the main category \"Best Comic\" are listed here. The following articles provide complete listings of all nominees and winners in each year:\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, users of internet forum The Webcomic List held an amateur award ceremony, where winners of its various categories were selected through a panel of judges. The ceremony itself was presented in the form of a webcomic, allowing it to spoof televised award shows as well as exhibit sample portions of the awardees.\n\nThe Eagle Award is a series of awards for comic book titles and creators. They are awarded by UK fan voting for work produced during the previous year. The awards featured a \"favourite web-based comic\" category from 2001 until its discontinuation in 2012.\n\nThe Will Eisner Comic Industry Award, commonly shortened to the Eisner Award, is a prize given for creative achievement in American comic books. In 2003, Justine Shaw's \"Nowhere Girl\" received a nomination for an Eisner award in the \"best new series\" category, while Shaw was nominated for \"talent deserving of wider recognition\", making her the first webcomic artist to be nominated for an Eisner. \"Paste Magazine\" noted in 2016 that the Eisner's conflation of \"digital comic\" and \"webcomic\" may cause independent works to be overshadowed by online services such as Marvel Unlimited and DC Comics' \"Digital First\". In 2017, it was split into \"Best Digital Comic\" and \"Best Webcomic\".\n\nThe Harvey Awards, named for writer-artist Harvey Kurtzman (1924-1993) and coordinated by the publisher Fantagraphics, are given for achievement in comic books. The Harveys were created as part of a successor to the Kirby Awards which were discontinued after 1987.\n\nFollowing the revamp in 2018 after the awards moved to New York Comic Con, the \"Best Online Comics Work\" has been renamed \"Digital Book of the Year\".\n\nThe Ignatz Awards are intended to recognize outstanding achievements in comics and cartooning by small press creators or creator-owned projects published by larger publishers. They have been awarded each year since 1997, but skipped a year in 2001 due to the show's cancellation after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Recipients of the award are determined by the votes of the attendees of the annual Small Press Expo.\n\nThe award for webcomics was first awarded in 2012 for work produced during the previous year. It was divided the following year into two separate categories, \"On-Line Comics – Short Form\" and \"On-Line Comics – Long Form\".\n\nPresented by the \"Slate Book Review\" and the Center for Cartoon Studies, the Cartoonist Studio Prize was first awarded in 2013 for work produced during the previous year.

More recently, the mobile cinema world has seen the relaunch of a recently restored 1967 custom built mobile cinema unit (see 'History' below).\n\nSince 2006, Italy's Cortomobile, a mobile cinema seating two viewers, has projected short films and animations in cinema festivals and has been the protagonist of the First Car Film Festival (Florence) in March 2009.\n\nSince 1995, Cinetransformer International of Miami, Florida has circulated a fleet of mobile cinema units for use in event and experiential marketing. With a patented stadium style configuration of 91 seats, the Cinetransformer debuted as the world's first 3D mobile cinema at Comic Con in 2010 with the release of Jackass 3 in 3D. It was chosen again in 2011 to debut Final Destination 5 In 3D.\n\nDuring the Russian Civil War between Communists and counter-revolutionaries, the early cinema pioneer, Dziga Vertov, helped establish and run a film-car on Mikhail Kalinin's agit-train. He had equipment to shoot, develop, edit, and project film. The trains went to battlefronts on agitation-propaganda missions intended primarily to bolster the morale of the troops. They were also intended to stir up revolutionary fervor of the masses.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Tony Benn, working under Harold Wilson's Labour government, commissioned seven custom built mobile cinema units for the Ministry of Technology campaign to 'raise standards' and promote British industry. The project was short-lived and the units were sold off at government auction in 1974, most are thought to have been long since decommissioned and disappeared. However, one has survived via purchase by Sir William McAlpine to tour with the Flying Scotsman locomotive he rescued from America, and consequently donated to the Transport Trust in 1975 where it was in preservation for 15 years. It has since been through several private owners and following a full restoration is now in operation as Vintage Mobile Cinema, based in the South West of England. In May 2015, the only remaining Vintage Mobile Cinema was sold and will be moving to its new home on the Hertfordshire/Buckinghamshire border.\n\nMobile cinema was very popular during the colonial periods in Africa when Land Rovers were used as movie vans to transport a white linen screen, usually mounted on the Land Rover, a portable generator, a 16mm projector and mounted loudspeakers. In this way rural areas received propaganda and educational films, usually shown in the evenings during dark hours.\n\nThe Sol Cinema is based in the UK and seats 8 people, leading it to be billed as the World's smallest solar powered cinema in 2010. It uses an LED projector showing short films in cinematic surroundings complete with usherettes; batteries to store the energy from the Sun to power the cinema. Their photovoltaic panels harness the sunlight, even as the films are being shown so they never run out of power. The Sol Cinema won a Digital Hero award for best use of sustainable technology in 2014. Total Film magazine listed the Sol Cinema at number 26th in the 'Best Movie Cinemas in the World'.\n\nSol Cinema is booked to perform at Glastonbury Festival each year. It also tours all over the UK and Ireland.\n\nIn Ireland, mobile cinemas operated from the 1920s to the mid-1960s. A portable wooden structure was erected, with seating for up to 250 people. The building had wooden sides and a canvas roof, approximately 40 ft. by 24 ft. The 35mm projector was housed in a caravan at one end of the building. These shows travelled winter and summer in all sorts of weather; at times gales forced them to remove the canvas roof of the cinema sometimes at night when the winds made it hard to do so. There were up to 20 families touring Ireland, mainly in isolated areas where the nearest permanent cinema was miles away. These mobile cinemas stayed up to 3 weeks in a village before moving to another area. The families lived in caravans had their own generators and a stock of films with them. During the war, transport became difficult as fuel for motor vehicles was in short supply. Some cinemas settled down for the duration of the war, whilst others reverted to horses to move their equipment from village to village and saved their fuel to run the generators. Even then they had to buy extra fuel on the black market at up to 30 shillings a gallon. The children of the showmen went to the local national schools for the duration of their stay; some went to 16 - 18 schools a year. Admission fees were around 1 shilling and 6 pence to 2 shillings for adults around the time when they ceased to tour in the 1960s. The arrival of TV ended these mobile cinemas however they will be remembered for bringing cinema to people in isolated areas some who had never seen talking movies. Most of the films shown were about 8 years old and had been bought by the show people who some had up to 5 weeks stock in hand showing for 2 hours a night , even though the showman owned the films they did not have the permission to show them to the public without paying excise duty each time they were shown needless to say they did not so every now and then along would come an excise officer and seize a film or at least just the Title of a film\n\nMost of the families changed to amusement shows, some operated their own circus, others went the way of stage shows some settled down to live in towns and villages. Most are still represented in show business by way of children and grandchildren others have moved to other countries. The names of some of these families are well remembered: The Lyons family, Mullins, Cullens, McCormacs, Courtneys, Lynns, McFaddens, Barrets, Corvinos, Roses, Gazetts, Bradleys, and many more; the names of some have nearly been forgotten by all but the oldest. In 1949, one of these families, Brian Lyons, was featured in the \"Times Pictorial\" in a full front page of images of their show and also a large article on other pages. The photos were all taken in Rosscarbery West Cork and contained some shots of locals sitting in the cinema. Over the years, a number of these mobile cinemas went up in flames due mainly to the type of film that was in use which was made up of a nitro solution. Luckily, no one was ever hurt though the buildings were destroyed in most cases. Most of those that suffered this fate were back on the road before long with help from other showmen. Today the name of McCormack, Mullins, McFadden, and Courtney are some of the names that still follow the roads to bring entertainment to the people of Ireland both in the city and remote country areas.\n\nSince 1999, Road Movie has been involved with unique cinematic events using mobile cinemas throughout South Australia, both in the city and country locations.\n"}

{"id": "1529797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1529797", "title": "Old Chicago", "text": "Old Chicago\n\nOld Chicago was a combination shopping mall and indoor amusement park that existed in the Chicago suburb of Bolingbrook, Illinois, from 1975 until 1980. It was billed as \"The world's first indoor amusement park\", and it was intended to draw visitors all year round, rain or shine. It opened to great fanfare and over 15,000 visitors on June 17, 1975, with an enormous building that housed major rides, such as two roller coasters and a Ferris wheel, as well as a turn-of-the-century themed shopping mall. However, only six months after opening, the complex ran into financial troubles due to construction cost overruns. The opening of a competing amusement park in the same general region (known today as Six Flags Great America) hurt attendance, and the lack of large anchor stores failed to draw enough local and repeat shoppers. Despite management changes, the center continued to lose money. By 1978, the mall began closing on Mondays and Tuesdays and in early 1980 the entire amusement park shut down and the rides were sold, only five years after opening. Efforts to find alternative uses for the huge building failed, and the structure was demolished in the spring of 1986.\n\nIts address was 555 S. Bolingbrook Drive, Bolingbrook, Illinois 60439.\n\nDesigner Robert Brindle conceived of the idea behind Old Chicago after a visit to Knott's Berry Farm amusement park in Buena Park, California, and wished to put an entire park - complete with roller coaster, Ferris wheel, and log flumes - indoors so that it could be open year-round. Brindle's concept featured an early 20th-century decor inside, with the mall featuring smaller local shops and boutiques rather than the traditional department stores that anchored most malls.\n\nOver two years in the making, Old Chicago was opened to the public on June 17, 1975, in a grand opening party that attracted over 10,000 invited guests, causing massive traffic jams. The Old Chicago TV commercial featured an 18-year-old Michelle Mauthe tap-dancing on top of the dome during high winds, while a cameraman filmed from inside a helicopter.\n\nConstruction on the mall was not yet complete and much of the electrical wiring was still exposed. When local officials saw the situation, the mall owners were told that they would not be able to open June 26 as scheduled. Construction crews worked around the clock to complete the project, and after a last-minute inspection, the mall opened on time to another crowd of over 15,000. In the mall's first months of operation, it received over 50,000 visitors each weekend.\n\nSoon, problems began developing with the mall's hurried construction. As early as July 1975, a malfunction in the mall's sprinkler system caused a six-hour shutdown of the mall. Later that year, a small fire in a trash compactor forced an evacuation of the mall. In November, acrobat Jimmy Troy fell to his death from the trapeze during a circus at the mall.\n\nOnly six months after opening, the mall was on the verge of bankruptcy due to millions of dollars in overruns in construction. Brindle was removed as general manager, and Illinois Central Railroad (an investor in the project) installed Clyde Farman.\n\nThe outdoor Six Flags Great America (then known as Marriott's Great America) theme park opened in 1976, drawing visitors away from Old Chicago. Unusual stores, boutiques, and a lack of recognizable anchor stores proved to be another of Old Chicago's undoings; the mall was not very successful in attracting \"local\" residents week after week because of a lack of stores they wanted to shop in. Late in 1976, as attendance declined, stores in the mall began closing down.\n\nIllinois Central took full control of the mall's logistics in early 1977, rescheduling the hours of operation and spending over $8 million adding new attractions. A series of management changes occurred, but the shops continued closing one by one.\n\nBy 1978, Old Chicago began closing on Mondays and Tuesdays. More fires struck during 1979: The Old Chicago Tobacco Company caught fire when a tobacco dryer malfunctioned. There were no sprinklers in the area where the fire started. A Fourth of July fireworks display also ignited prematurely, causing minor injuries to two people.\n\nFinally, in March 1980, the entire amusement park shut down and the rides were sold. The last remaining stores left soon afterward, as management pitched the idea of recreating the mall as a discount outlet. The plan didn't attract investors and the mall closed in August 1981. A group of investors purchased the enormous building shortly afterward with plans to convert it into a casino. The village of Bolingbrook nixed the idea and the building was put up for auction in 1982. Illinois Central expressed their desire to demolish the structure, but the village, in the hopes of finding a buyer, changed its zoning laws to prevent the destruction. While Bolingbrook sought a new buyer for the building, structural damage from roof leaks began damaging the vacant building. In addition, vandals repeatedly broke into the building, causing more damage.\n\nIn 1985, the building was finally sold to investment banker C.L. Carr, who initially pledged to keep the building open as an entertainment complex, but later attempted to sell parcels of the land beneath it. Last-ditch efforts to salvage the enormous building - as an international trade center for the People's Republic of China, as a venue for the 1992 World's Fair, even as a Major League Baseball stadium for the Chicago White Sox - would all fail and the building was demolished in the spring of 1986.\n\nDirector Brian De Palma filmed scenes from his 1978 supernatural thriller film \"The Fury\" at Old Chicago.\n\nThe concept of an amusement park inside a mall emerged years later at two famous malls—West Edmonton Mall in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (Galaxyland), and Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota (Nickelodeon Universe), as well as Adventuredome at Circus Circus in Las Vegas, and Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi. The Mall of America's amusement park was originally operated by the company who owned Knott's Berry Farm.\n\nThe now-expanded street where Old Chicago once stood is still named for the mall. Arena Auto Auction's address is 200 Old Chicago Drive.\n\nThe Chicago Loop roller coaster that stood inside the mall's amusement park is now called the \"Canobie Corkscrew\" and operates at Canobie Lake Park. It was among the first four in the world to turn riders upside down twice, along with Corkscrew at Knott's Berry Farm, Wabash Cannonball at Opryland USA, and Corkscrew at Magic Harbor, all four opening in 1975.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31605154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31605154", "title": "Post-network era", "text": "Post-network era\n\nThe post-network era, also known as the post-era era, is a concept that was popularized by Amanda D. Lotz. It denotes the period that followed an earlier network era, television's first institutional phase that started in the 1950s and ran through to the mid-1980s, and television's later multi-channel transition. It describes a period that saw the deterioration of the dominance of the Big Three television networks: ABC, CBS and NBC, and follows the creation of a wide variety of cable television channels that catered specifically to niche groups. The post-network era saw the development of technologies that deliver a wider diversity of programming choice, less constraints on a consumers choice of medium, decentralization of the location of their viewing, and freedom of choice over time of their viewing. For Amanda D. Lotz, the post-network era has been defined by five C's: \"choice, control, convenience, customization, and community\". These five concepts, which have defined the post-network era, all relate to the ways in which viewers have greater access to a wider array of content which can be consumed on their own terms. The concept comes from the field of Television studies, and has been used by various academics to discuss numerous different topics. The concept has been endorsed by media scholar Henry Jenkins, co-director of the Media Industries Project Michael Curtin, and American Studies, and Film and Media professor Jason Mittell.\n\nVast modifications were made to the way in which the television industry was operated following the earlier Network Era and a period of Multi-channel transition. The major factor governing the transition to a post-network paradigm was a computational and generational shift in the audience. These emergent developments in the post-network era have led television audiences to split attention between many different channels, devices, and forms of media as Television programs are no longer confined to the Television set.\n\nThe development of technologies with timeshifting abilities such as the VCR and DVR rendered broadcast times irrelevant, and also shifted discussion away from simple differentiation between cable and free-to-air television. Although much of this technological change coincided with the Multi-channel transition, its effect can be felt well into the post-network era, creating the groundwork for future technological developments including Hulu and Netflix On-Demand.\n\nThe increasing digitization of content has presented viewers with an increasing level of access to high quality televisual content on DVD and online. This has fostered the development of new portable methods of delivering media that help to bring television to spaces outside of the home. Consequently, multiple new revenue streams have emerged as television networks are able to sell shows through online storefronts like iTunes. The DVD market, too, has become a financially viable place to extract additional profits from television shows post-broadcast. In the case of Family Guy, this even led to the show's renewal in 2005 due to strong DVD sales, four years after its initial cancellation.\n\nIn order to reap the benefits of advertising in an era where television programs are no longer necessarily watched first-run on network television station, advertisers have innovated, using product placement in more popular television shows and producing their own branded entertainment, a form of media in which the content and advertising messages are inextricably linked. This differs from traditional advertising practices that only saw the broadcast of a number of 30-second adverts in chunks during pre-planned ad-breaks.\n\nA major aspect of the post-network era has been the development of new technologies that change the ways in which television is consumed and distributed. These technological changes have come about with the invention of the tablet, the use of smart phones, web-enabled devices connected to the television like many modern gaming consoles saw the subsequent development and wide uptake of online VOD services like Netflix and Hulu, as well as specific, network-branded streaming services. This shift in technology created a new-found level of convenience and mobility for viewers, as television trends towards a situation in which you can watch \"whatever show you want, whenever you want, on whatever screen you want\". Amanda D. Lotz argues that technologies like Netflix and NBC, Fox, and ABC's own Hulu have clearly impacted the way in which we access television, allowing us to catch up on television shows whenever we please rather than adhering to a first run schedule. Hulu also allows for interaction between fans of television shows while they are watching episodes through the site's inbuilt comment feature, creating the sort of immersive media experience and fostering a participatory culture of affiliation, two major interests of Henry Jenkins. This technological change also brings a change in theatricality, as television producers respond to the ways in which their audiences watch television.\n\nOne of the major developments in the post-network era has been the decision by a fragmented cable network system to target specific groups with their programming rather than a homogeneous mass audience. As consumers began to watch television programs on tablets and cell phones in their own time, niche channels emerged from the expansion of cable television networks, advertising became integrated into television shows rather than ad-breaks, and people were no longer tied to a 24-week first-run broadcast cycle. Producers responded to changing consumption patterns by changing the ways in which they produce television content, which resulted in the creation of shows like Sex and the City, Breaking Bad and Arrested Development (which aired on network television) with features that were unrepresentative of those developed in the Network era and during the Multi-channel transition.\n\n"}
{"id": "35450747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35450747", "title": "Prostitution in Togo", "text": "Prostitution in Togo\n\nProstitution in Togo is legal and commonplace. Related activities such as solicitation, living off the earnings of prostitution or procuring are prohibited. Punishment is up to 10 years imprisonment if minors or violence is involved.\n\nSex trafficking, child prostitution and HIV are problems in the country. However, the country has recently introduced some government codes, and has also started enforcing existing codes, such as a child code protecting the rights of children throughout the country, in order to help combat some of these problems.\n\nIn 2014, it was estimated there were 10,284 sex workers in the country. A 2011 survey found 51% worked in bars and 26% in brothels. About half of the country's sex workers are in Lomé. According to research published in 2015, between 2005 and 2015, prostitution in the country increased 180%, and that three quarters of the prostitutes are Togolese, and Ghanaian women 15%. It is not uncommon for prostitutes travel between Togo and neighbouring countries to find work.\n\nThere are reports of brothels and prostitutes working in various parts of Lomé, including \"Décor\" and Kodjoviakopé (near Aflao across the Ghanaian border). The nationalities of the prostitutes include Togolese as well as Nigerians, Liberians, Ghanaians and Ivorian nationals. Many sex workers in the city have regular taxi drivers who run them around and wait while the woman is with a client. Hotel managers may also offer special rates if the sex worker brings clients there regularly.\n\nA number of university students are turning to prostitution for financial reasons.\n\nProstitution grew with the colonisation by Germany. Initially occurring along the coast, especially Lomé, and then spreading inland as colonisation advanced into the interior. In Lomé, Aného and Atakpamé, African prostitutes serving only European males were required to live in designated areas known as \"kasernierung\". A brothel was built in Lomé in 1909 to replace the \"kasernierung\" area. Initially it housed 40 prostitutes.\n\nFollowing the defeat of Germany in World War I and subsequent French control of the country, prostitution continued to flourish. The large number of single, or married men away from home, colonists and troops created the demand for prostitution. As in other French colonies, military brothels (Bordel militaire de campagne) were set up around where troops were stationed.\n\nExperts convened by the United Nations found that typically \"all the responsibility\" of the problems that are faced in the sex industry are usually placed on women. In response to the issues noted by this committee, the government of Togo has declared that July 31 is Women's Day throughout the country. Additionally, this may have been what encouraged them to enact on some of their new policies, such as actively enforcing laws that protect children against the sex trade. This committee noted that sex was a two person act and that the men who are typically the demand market for sex workers need to be examined too and held accountable for their actions.\n\nHIV and syphilis are problems in the country. Sex workers and their clients are high risk groups, especially as condom use is inconsistent, although there are 11 different prevention programmes distributing condoms throughout the country.\n\nHIV prevalence has dropped amongst sex workers: 29.5% in 2005, 13.1% in 2011 and 11.7% in 2015. (National adult HIV prevalence was 2.1% in 2016.) However, prevalence rates vary across the country; although the average amongst sex workers was 13.1% in 2011, it ranged from 19.5% in Lomé to 7.8% in the Savanes and Kara Regions.\n\nA study in 2008 noted that as many as 60% of long truck drivers in Togo that were having sexual relations with sex workers were not using a condom during sex. Additionally, around 50% of the truck drivers interviewed stated that they had not been tested for HIV, which is a concerning statistic considering the prevalence of sexually-transmitted diseases in Togo.\n\nA study in 2011 found 2.2% of sex workers were infected with syphilis, and 2.3% of clients. This also varied by region with those in Lomé having the highest rate of infection at 3.1%.\n\nHomosexual men, women, and couples do not receive the same access to the ability to be diagnosed and treated for a potential case of HIV/AIDS that heterosexual couples receive.\n\nIn the 2000s concerns were raised internationally about child prostitution in Togo.\nTogolese law explicitly prohibits the sexual exploitation of children and child prostitution, although it is not effectively enforced. NGO organizations such as UNICEF have intervened to try to get child prostitutes off the streets. There are also reports of women being trafficked for prostitution.\n\nAnother issue in Togo is that the laws do not protect well against child trafficking, and these children are usually sold in to the sex industry. Togo does not enforce the law that prevents selling children into sex slavery, and there is also no statutory rape law in Togo. Since 2007 the Togolese government has done a better job of raising awareness for people in Togo about the issues of child sexual exploitation and child prostitution. They released a code in 2007 which protected the rights of children in certain areas of life, and this code led to the eventual release of hundreds of child sex workers throughout the country of Togo, after they improved their efforts to enforce this code. Once these children were rounded up, they were properly taken care of, and tested for a variety of medical issues, mostly of mostly sexual health aspects.\n\nTogo is a source, transit and, to a lesser extent, destination country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. The western border of the Plateau region, which provides easy access to major roads leading to Lome, and Accra, Ghana, was a primary source for trafficking victims during the reporting period. Most Togolese victims are children exploited within the country. Traffickers bring children from rural areas to Lome, where they are exploited in child sex trafficking. Girls from Ghana are exploited in sex trafficking in Togo. From September to April, many Togolese adults and children migrate in search of economic opportunities to Benin, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Mali, where many are subjected to sex trafficking. Togolese women have been fraudulently recruited for employment in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, the United States, and Europe, where they are subjected to forced prostitution.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Togo as a \"Tier 2 Watch List\" country.\n\nIn 2005, in a raid in the capital city Lome, over 200 people were arrested in an operation designed to reduce child prostitution. The government had previously announced on the radio its commitment to address the issue. The government's minister for child protection, Agneley Christine Mensah, said that the children who had been arrested would be taken into care and helped \"to acquire new trades and skills so that they can be integrated into normal social and economic life\".\n"}
{"id": "489626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=489626", "title": "Rating site", "text": "Rating site\n\nA rating site (less commonly, a \"rate-me site\") is a website designed for users to vote on or rate people, content, or other things. Rating sites are typically organized around attributes such as physical appearance, body parts, voice, personality, etc. They may also be devoted to the subjects' occupational ability, for example teachers, professors, lawyers, doctors, etc.\n\nRating sites typically show a series of images (or other content) in random fashion, or chosen by computer algorithm, rather than allowing users to choose. They then ask users for a rating or assessment, which is generally done quickly and without great deliberation. Users score items on a scale of 1 to 10, yes or no. Others, such as BabeVsBabe.com, ask users to choose between two pictures. Typically, the site gives instant feedback in terms of the item's running score, or the percentage of other users who agree with the assessment. They sometimes offer aggregate statistics or \"best\" and \"worst\" lists. Most allow users to submit their own image, sample, or other relevant content for others to rate. Some require the submission as a condition of membership.\n\nRating sites usually provide some features of social network services and online communities such as discussion forums messaging, and private messaging. Some function as a form of dating service, in that for a fee they allow users to contact other users. Many social networks and other sites include rating features. For example, MySpace and TradePics have optional \"rank\" features for users to be rated by other users.\n\nOne category of rating sites, such as Hot or Not or HotFlation, is devoted to rating contributors' physical attractiveness. Other looks-based rating sites include RateMyFace.com (an early site, launched in the Summer of 1999) and NameMyVote, which asks users to guess a person's political party based on their looks. Some sites are devoted to rating the appearance of pets (e.g. kittenwar.com, petsinclothes.com, and meormypet.com). Another class allows users to rate short video or music clips. One variant, a \"Darwinian poetry\" site, allows users to compare two samples of entirely computer-generated poetry using a Condorcet method. Successful poems \"mate\" to produce poems of ever-increasing appeal. Yet others are devoted to disliked men (DoucheBagAlert), bowel movements (ratemypoo.com), unsigned bands (RateBandsOnline.com), politics (RateMyTory.Com), nightclubs, business professionals, clothes, cars, and many other subjects.\n\nWhen rating sites are dedicated to rating products (epinions.com), brands (brandmojo.org), services, or businesses rather than to rating people (i-rate.me), and are used for more serious or well thought-out ratings, they tend to be called review sites, although the distinction is not exact.\n\nThe popularity of rating people and their abilities on a scale, such as 1–10, traces back to at least the late 20th century, and the algorithms for aggregating quantitative rating scores far earlier than that. The 1979 film \"10\" is an example of this. The title derives from a rating system Dudley Moore uses to grade women based upon beauty, with a 10 being the epitome of attractiveness. The notion of a \"perfect ten\" came into common usage as a result of this film. In the film, Moore rates Bo Derek an \"11\".\n\nIn 1990, one of the first computer-based photographic attractiveness rating studies was conducted. During this year psychologists J. H. Langlois and L. A. Roggman examined whether facial attractiveness was linked to geometric averageness. To test their hypothesis, they selected photographs of 192 male and female Caucasian faces; each of which was computer scanned and digitized. They then made computer-processed composites of each image, as 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, and 32-face composites. The individual and composite faces were then rated for attractiveness by 300 judges on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very unattractive, 5 = very attractive). The 32-composite face was the most visually attractive of all the faces. Subsequent studies were done on a 10-point scale.\n\nIn 1992, \"Perfect 10\" magazine and video programming was launched by Xui, the original executive editor of \"Spin\" magazine, to feature only women who would rank 10 for attractiveness. Julie Kruis, a swimsuit model, was the original spokesmodel. In 1996, Rasen created the first \"\"Perfect 10\" Model Search\" at the Pure Platinum club near Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

{"id": "58892821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58892821", "title": "Regular tuning and temperament", "text": "Regular tuning and temperament\n\nIn the traditional theory of music, a regular temperament is an assignment of relative pitches to the notes of the chromatic scale (i.e. a \"tuning\" of this scale), in which every interval of a perfect fifth is tempered by the same amount. A tuning in which all the perfect fifths remain untempered is called \"Pythagorean tuning\". In this article, unless the context implies otherwise, the unqualified term \"fifth\" by itself will mean \"perfect fifth\".\n\nAuthorities differ as to which tunings they regard as being included amongst those they refer to as \"temperaments\", and therefore as to whether or not they include Pythagorean tuning amongst those they refer to as \"regular temperaments\". Some treat the term \"temperament\" as a synonym for \"tuning\", others reserve the term \"temperament\" for tunings that are not any form of just intonation (including Pythagorean tuning), and one eminent musicologist, James Murray Barbour, required a temperament to have at least one interval with an irrational frequency ratio. In any case, all regular temperaments and Pythagorean tuning are collectively referred to as \"regular tunings\". Tunings and temperaments which include perfect fifths of different sizes are called \"irregular\".\n\nIn the diatonic scales of common practice Western music, any note is either separated from another by a whole number of perfect fifths, or is in the same pitch class as such a note.\nIn these scales, therefore, the interval between any pair of notes can be formed either by adding a whole number of fifths to, or subtracting them from, a whole number of octaves, or by subtracting a whole number of octaves from a whole number of fifths. A regular tuning of such scales, therefore, can be constructed from a single chain of fifths, the pitch of any note being determined by that of a single reference note and the common size of all the perfect fifths. There are, however, some more extended scales for which the construction of regular tunings requires two or more chains of fifths offset from each other by intervals which cannot be formed from combinations of whole numbers of fifths and octaves.\n\nA modified concept of regular tuning has been proposed by some modern musical theorists, who define it to be a general system of music intervals produced by combining together intervals of a finite number of fixed sizes, not necessarily including a fifth or an octave.\n\nSome examples of regular temperaments are meantone temperaments and equal temperaments.\n\nIn the chromatic scale of western music, the perfect fifths are the intervals between any two successive notes in the following list:\n\nor its extension to include notes with more flats or sharps. An assignment of pitches to these notes, and others in the same pitch classes, is a regular tuning if the intervals between pairs of successive notes in the list are all the same size. The tuning is Pythagorean if the intervals are all just perfect fifths, or is a regular temperament if they are tempered fifths.\n\nDenote the size of the fifth, as a fraction of an octave, by \"f\". For the fifths to qualify as tempered, \"f\" must be close, but not exactly equal, to its just value of . To preserve the proper pitch ordering of the notes within each octave,\n\nit must also satisfy the inequalities, 4/7 < \"f\" < 3/5.\n\nIn such a regular tuning, the common size of the intervals E–F and B–C, the diatonic semitone, is 3 − 5\"f\" of an octave. The common size of the intervals between the flattened version of a note and the note itself, or between the note itself and its sharpened version, the chromatic semitone, is 7\"f\" − 4 of an octave.\nThe common size of the intervals C–D, D–E, F–G, G–A and A–B, the whole tone, is the sum of the diatonic and chromatic semitones, or 2\"f\" − 1 of an octave. The diatonic semitone is larger than, smaller than, or equal to, the chromatic semitone according as \"f\" is less than, greater than, or equal to, 7/12. In the last case, the diatonic and chromatic semitones are both 1/12 of an octave, exactly half the size of a tone, and the tuning is 12-tone equal temperament.\n\nUnless \"f\" = 7/12, as in 12-tone equal temperament, the first five notes in the list above, G, D, A, E, B, will not belong to the same pitch classes as the last five, F, C, G, D, A, and therefore not be enharmonically equivalent to them. If \"f\" > 7/12, each sharp is 12\"f\" − 7 of an octave sharper than its otherwise enharmonically equivalent flat, whereas, if \"f\" < 7/12, it is 7 − 12\"f\" of an octave flatter. On a standard musical keyboard, with only the 12 notes of the chromatic scale in each octave, only one note from each of the enharmonically alternative pairs, F/G, C/D, G/A, D/E, A/B, can be assigned to any one of the appropriate black keys. The assignments traditionally chosen were either F, C, G, E and B, or F, C, A, E and B. The size of the intervals G–E and C–A (and of the other diminished sixths, B–G, F–D, D–B and A–F) is 7 − 11\"f\" of an octave. For most of the regular temperaments used in practice in the past, these intervals were too dissonant to perform acceptably as perfect fifths, and were then referred to pejoratively as \"wolf intervals\".\n\nA regular tuning is obtained by selecting the desired size of the perfect fifths and constructing one or more chains of fifths, in which the upper end-point of each fifth is the same as the lower end-point of the next one in the same chain. The scale to be tuned comprises all the notes belonging to the same pitch classes as those at the end-points of the fifths in all the chains. If an end-point of one of the fifths in each chain is taken as a reference, the pitches of all the notes of the scale relative to those references can be determined by travelling in either direction by a whole number of fifths along the appropriate chain, starting from its reference, and then moving up or down by a whole number of octaves. When there is more than one chain, the pitches of the notes in one chain relative to those of another are completely determined by any single interval between any pair of notes, of which one belongs to the first chain and the other to the second.\n\nIf a chain of twelve fifths starts from the note A, the notes at the ends of successive fifths in the chain will be:\nIf the G at the end of the chain is not in the same pitch class as the A at its start, then extending the chain upwards will produce notes D, A, E, B, F, ... etc., and extending it downwards will similarly produce notes D, G, C, F, B, ... etc. The following tables give the sizes in fractions of an octave of the intervals between the note C at the start of an octave and each of the naturals, sharps and flats within the octave immediately above it when it is tuned with a regular tuning whose fifth is a fraction of an octave. The columns of the tables are ordered according to the sizes of the corresponding intervals.\n\nThe regular tunings given as examples below have either been proposed or used as a means of determining the relative pitches of the notes in the above sequence.\n\nIn the traditional definition of regular tuning, it is taken for granted that the perfect fifth whose size is being fixed by the tuning is that of the diatonic major scale of common practice Western music. A regular tuning in this sense is thus inextricably tied to the structure of that scale and others closely associated with it. It is a much less useful concept for other styles of music whose scales cannot be straightforwardly derived from the diatonic.\n\nSome musical theorists have recently proposed an alternative definition of regular tuning which can be applied to a wider range of musical styles. According to this alternative definition, a regular tuning is a collection of intervals which can be produced by combining together intervals of a finite number of fixed sizes. For the purposes of the definition, an interval is regarded as being completely determined by just its size and direction (ascending or descending), independent of any specific range of pitches which it might span, with a descending interval being regarded as the negative of an ascending one of the same size. Thus, the intervals between any of the pairs of notes [C,E], [D,F], [E,G], etc., in 12-tone equal temperament, for example, are considered to be merely separate instantiations of the \"same\" interval—an ascending tempered major third of size one-third of an octave—, and the intervals between the pairs [E,C], [F,D], [G,E], etc., to be instantiations of its negative—a \"descending\" tempered major third of the same size. An ascending interval in this sense can therefore be represented by a single number that specifies it size, and a descending one by the negative of the number specifying its size.\n\nA regular tuning in this alternative sense is not required to contain octaves or perfect fifths, or to be usable for tuning any of the usual scales of common practice music, and will therefore not necessarily be obtainable as the set of intervals of a regular tuning in the traditional sense. The collection of intervals that can be produced by combining together octaves, just perfect fifths and just major thirds, for instance, although a regular tuning according to this alternative definition, cannot be the set of intervals of any tuning that is regular under the traditional definition. For the rest of this article, the term \"regular tuning\", unless otherwise qualified, will be used in this alternative sense.\n\nIntervals that can be combined together to produce all the other intervals of a given regular tuning are called \"generators\" of the tuning. Any interval of such a tuning must have the form    , where  , and   are generators for it, and  , and    are integers. The minimum number of non-zero generators needed to produce all the intervals of the tuning is called its \"rank\", and regular tunings of rank 2 are called \"linear\". The collection of \"all\" intervals obtainable by combining together the generators of a regular tuning has the mathematical structure of a free abelian group of the same rank. The theory of these groups can therefore be useful for investigating the properties of regular tunings.\n\nThe intervals of any regular tuning in the traditional sense can be obtained by combining together its perfect fifth, a pure octave, and possibly some intervals separating chains of fifths that may be offset from one another. That set of Intervals is therefore a regular tuning in the alternative sense. The set of intervals of an equal temperament—in which just one size of interval is needed to produce all the others—has rank 1. Since the intervals of Pythagorean tuning and meantone and Helmholtzian temperaments can be produced from their fifths and the octave, but not from any intervals of just one size, those sets of intervals have rank 2, and are therefore linear.\n\nAn interval obtainable as a combination of generators whose sizes in octaves are all of the form , with all being prime numbers no greater than some fixed prime , is called a \"\"p\"-limit interval\", and a regular tuning is called a \"p\"-limit tuning if all its intervals are \"p\"-limit intervals. Thus, since the intervals of Pythagorean tuning are generated by the octave, of size one (i.e. ) octave, and the just perfect twelfth, of size octaves, they form a 3-limit tuning. Likewise, the set of intervals generated by the octave, a just perfect twelfth, and a just major seventeenth, of size octaves, constitutes a 5-limit tuning. Since this set of intervals cannot be generated by any smaller collection of generators, it is a regular tuning of rank 3.\n\nIn just intonation, the pair of notes forming every consonance has a frequency ratio whose numerator and denominator are small whole numbers. As a consequence, these intervals must belong to a \"p\"-limit tuning for some small prime . Thus, the intervals of Ptolemy's syntonic diatonic scale, for instance, in which the relative pitches of the notes are completely determined by the requirement that all three of its primary triads be perfectly just major chords, form a 5-limit tuning, since they can be generated by intervals of sizes , , and octaves.\n\nBy going one step further, to proper 7-limit tunings, it is possible to obtain regular tunings with perfectly just septimal intervals. The regular tuning generated by intervals of sizes , , , and octaves, for instance, is a 7-limit tuning of rank 4 which contains perfectly just harmonic seventh intervals of size octaves, as well as perfect fourths and fifths, and major and minor thirds and sixths which are all perfectly just.\n\nBy definition, a tempered interval is one which is very nearly—but not quite—just. Thus, if      are all either tempered or just intervals of a regular tuning, there must be some just intervals,    , such that      are all very close to zero. Since    and   are all just, they must belong to a \"p\"-limit tuning for some small prime \"p\". If they are all distinct, and there is no interval which can be expressed in two or more different ways as a combination of them, then the association of the interval     to the interval    , for each \"r\"-tuple,   , of integers, defines a mathematical function from the \"p\"-limit tuning generated by     onto the regular tuning generated by    . This function, which turns out to be a useful tool for the construction of tunings with desired properties, is called a \"temperament mapping\".\n\nThe only just interval of 12-tone equal temperament is the octave. Its tempered intervals are its perfect fourth and fifth, and its major and minor third and sixth, whose sizes in octaves are , , , , , respectively. The corresponding just intervals can all be generated from the octave, just perfect fifth and just major third. Thus, the temperament mapping for the intervals of 12-tone equal temperament associates the 5-limit interval    , for any triple of integers,   , with the interval    .\n\nIf a regular tuning generated by an octave and a tempered perfect fifth of size    octaves, the sizes of its perfect fourth, major and minor thirds, and major and minor sixths, in octaves, are  ,  ,  ,   , and\n, respectively. If    (quarter-comma meantone), the octave, major thirds and minor sixths are perfectly just, but all other consonances are tempered. If   (one-third-comma meantone), the octave, minor thirds and major sixths are perfectly just, and all other consonances are tempered. Otherwise, all consonances except the octave are tempered. In any case, the temperament mapping for the intervals of this temperament associates the 5-limit interval   , for any triple of integers,   , with the interval   .\n\nThe just intervals of schismic temperament are its octave and perfect fourth and fifth, and its tempered intervals are its major and minor third and sixth. The sizes of these latter intervals, in octaves, are , , , and , respectively. Thus, the temperament mapping for the intervals of schismic temperament associates the 5-limit interval    , for any triple of integers,   , with the interval    .\n\nThe just intervals of Helmholtzian temperament are its octave, major third and minor sixth, and its tempered intervals are its perfect fourth and fifth, and its minor third and major sixth. The sizes of these latter intervals, in octaves, are , , , and , respectively. Thus, the temperament mapping for the intervals of Helmholtzian temperament associates the 5-limit interval    , for any triple of integers,   , with the interval    .\n\nLet be the temperament mappings for the intervals of 12-tone equal temperament, a regular tuning generated by an octave and a fifth, and schismic and Helmholtzian temperaments respectively, as described above. The following table lists the images of each of the 5-limit just consonances under these temperament mappings.\nThe purpose of tempering consonances is to allow a greater number of them to be accommodated within the confines of a fixed scale, at the expense of compromising their purity. In a regular tuning, this manifests itself in the existence of intervals that can be formed from two \"different\" combinations of consonances, even though their corresponding just versions are independent.\n\nIn 12-tone equal temperament, an interval comprising 7 octaves can also be expressed as a combination of 12 perfect fifths. In any regular tuning generated by an octave and a tempered fifth (including 12-tone equal temperament), an interval comprising 4 perfect fifths can be expressed as a combination of 2 octaves plus a major third. In both schismic and Helmholtzian temperament an interval comprising 5 octaves can be expressed as a combination of 8 perfect fifths plus a major third.\n\nIf    are the temperament mappings defined above, these relations can be written as:\n\nThat is, these relations correspond to the ditonic comma's being mapped to zero under the temperament mapping of 12-tone equal temperament, the syntonic comma's being mapped to zero under the temperament mappings of any regular tuning generated by an octave and a tempered fifth, and the schisma's being mapped to zero under the temperament mappings of schismic and Helmholtzian temperaments.\n\nIf some interval of a regular tuning can be formed from two different combinations of its consonances,   , whose corresponding just versions are independent, there must exist positive whole numbers,   , and   , with    for any , such that\n\nSubtracting the right side of this equation from the left gives\n\nwhere    for   . Such an equation is called a \"(linear) relation\".\n\nIf    is the temperament mapping for the regular tuning, and    the just consonances such that    for   , the above linear relation can be written as\n\nThus,   , which is a non-zero \"p\"-limit interval for some small prime \"p\", is mapped to zero by the temperament mapping   . If all the integers    and    are reasonably small in magnitude, then because each of the intervals    is equal to, or closely approximated by, the corresponding   , the interval    will be quite small. It is referred to as a \"\"comma\".\n\nThe set of all \"p\"-limit intervals    such that    is called the \"comma lattice\"\" of the tuning. The comma lattice of the general regular tuning described above is itself another a regular tuning whose rank is strictly less than  . It follows from one of the fundamental theorems of linear algebra that the rank of the regular tuning and the rank of its comma lattice must sum to  .\n\nThe regular tuning formed by the intervals of 12-tone equal temperament has rank 1. Its comma lattice, generated by the syntonic and ditonic commas, has rank 2.\n\nA regular tuning generated by the octave and a tempered perfect fifth whose size in octaves is irrational has rank 2. Its comma lattice, generated by the syntonic comma, has rank 1.\n\nThe regular tuning formed by the intervals of schismic temperament and that formed by the intervals of Helmholtzian temperament both have rank 2. They both have the same comma lattice, generated by the schisma, of rank 1.\n\nIf a regular tuning has generators    that satisfy one or more linear relations, then its rank   , say, will be strictly less than   . Although there must then exist a set of    generators for the tuning, it may not always be possible to select these from among the unmodified generators in the original set,  } . In general, some, at least, of the intervals in a minimal set of    generators will have to be constructed as combinations of 2 or more of the originals.\n\nConsider the regular tuning generated by the octave, just perfect fifth, and a tempered major third of size octaves. A temperament mapping   for this tuning is defined by   . The generators satisfy the relation   , corresponding to the comma   , a 5-limit interval of size approximately 13.7 cents. Although this regular tuning has rank 2, none of its original generators can be expressed as a combination of the other two, so no pair of them can serve as generators for it. The fifth part,   , of a just perfect fourth, however, can be written as    (a combination of the original generators), and since   ,   , and   , either the octave or the just perfect fifth together with the interval constitute a pair of generators for this tuning.\n\nFinding a minimal set of generators for a regular tuning with consonances satisfying some linear relations requires, in general, some fairly advanced, but well-known, techniques of linear algebra. Proofs are omitted from the following outline.\n\nIf the generators    of a regular tuning satisfy the linear relations:\nand no others apart from linear combinations of these, then the rank, , say, of the tuning's comma lattice is the rank of the matrix    whose entries are the integers   , and the rank of the tuning itself is   . Let    be the Smith normal form of   ,    be    and    unimodular matrices such that   ,    be the    submatrix of    comprising its last    rows,    be the    submatrix of    comprising its last    columns,    be the    column vector whose entries are   , and let   .\n\nSince the entries of    are integers, the entries,   , of    are intervals in the tuning generated by   . But since the entries of    are also integers, and   , it follows that    constitute a minimal set of    generators for the tuning.\na.  The matrix of the right side of the relation   , satisfied by the generators   , and    of the immediately preceding example, is   , which has Smith normal form  . Postmultiplying    by either of the two unimodular matrices,\nwill reduce it to its Smith normal form:\n\nThe inverses of these unimodular matrices are:\n\nApplied to the original generators,   , and   , the first of these produces the pair of generators    and   , while the second produces the pair    and   .\nb. (Miracle temperament)   Consider the regular tuning generated by the octave,  , temperered perfect fifth,   , of size\n\ntempered major third,   , of size and two other intervals,   , of sizes \n\nThe generators    satisfy the set of relations\n\nwhich has matrix\n\nPostmultiplying    by the unimodular matrix\n\nreduces it to Smith normal form:\n\nFrom this it follows that the tuning has rank 2, and its comma lattice rank 3. The last two rows of the inverse of   ,\ngive the octave,   , and the interval   octaves as a minimal set of two generators for the tuning. This last interval is called a \"secor\", after George Secor, who discovered it, and the regular tuning just described is called \"miracle temperament\". The tuning's tempered fifth comprises 6 secors, and its tempered major third one octave minus 7 secors. Its minor sixth is thus tempered to 7 secors.\n\n"}

{"id": "14330722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14330722", "title": "Telefon Hírmondó", "text": "Telefon Hírmondó\n\nThe Telefon Hírmondó (also Telefonhírmondó, generally translated as \"Telephone Herald\") was a \"telephone newspaper\" located in Budapest, Hungary, which, beginning in 1893, provided news and entertainment to subscribers over telephone lines. It was both the first and the longest surviving telephone newspaper system, although from late 1925 until its termination in 1944 it was primarily used to retransmit programmes broadcast by an affiliated radio station.\n\nThree decades before the development of radio broadcasting, the \"Telefon Hírmondó\" was the first service to electronically deliver a wide range of spoken and musical programming to a diverse audience. Although its inventor envisioned that the technology could be eventually expanded to serve a national or international audience, the technical limitations of the time ultimately limited its service area to just the city of Budapest.\n\nThe \"Telefon Hírmondó\" was founded by Tivadar Puskás (a few reviews translated his name as \"Theodore Buschgasch\"), an engineer and inventor who had worked with Thomas Edison. In view of the ever-increasing pace of living, especially in major cities, Puskás recognized that daily newspapers, even with multiple editions, could no longer effectively keep up with developing events. He decided that this problem could be rectified through the introduction of a regularly updated audio news source.\n\nInitially, the \"Telefon Hírmondó\" editorial office was located near Astoria, at 6 Magyar Street. The system began operating on 15 February 1893 with around 60 subscribers, and was inaugurated with a message from Puskás, which, translated into English, stated:\n\nAt this time newspapers published in the Austro-Hungarian Empire had to be authorized by the government. The contemporary press laws did not apply to a telephone newspaper, and government officials were wary that the \"Telefon Hírmondó\" could develop into an \"important tool of power\", as it could potentially be used to quickly spread strategic, political, and social information. The \"Telefon Hírmondó\" had started operations based on an informal verbal approval, in order to demonstrate that the idea was practical. After two weeks of successful operation, on 2 March 1893 Puskás sent a letter to Béla Lukács, the Hungrarian Minister of Trade, requesting formal authorization to run his \"newspaper\", under the provisions of the Act No. XXXXI of 1888. Included was a request to be assigned fifty years of exclusive rights for operation within the city of Budapest, although the government was eventually unwilling to approve this portion of the request.\n\nTividar Puskás died on 16 March 1893, just one month after the \"Telefon Hírmondó\" had been launched. His brother, Albert Puskás, took over responsibility for the service, moved the center of operations to 24 Ersébet street, and resumed talks with the government for the formal operating authorization. Included in these discussions were any fees that should be paid to the government, plus limits on the operation's profits. In addition, because the initial design had subscribers using their existing telephones to call the \"Telefon Hírmondó\", there was a question as to how much the telephone company should be compensated for the use of its lines.\n\nWhile these negotiations were ongoing, Albert Puskás sold the \"Telefon Hírmondó\", along with the associated patent rights, to a local engineer, István Popper, who, effective 26 September 1894, accepted the authorization conditions put forward by the government authorities. The permission to operate included the provision that the \"Telefon Hírmondó\" staff would write down the news reports in advance and have them signed by both the manager and the announcer, with copies of the pages sent three times a day to the Budapest Royal Prosecutor and the Budapest Police Department, plus the next day to the concerned ministries.\n\nPopper created The Telefonhírmondó Joint stock company, modernized the equipment, and broadened the range of the programmes. In October 1894, the offices were moved to 22 Kerepesi street, with Emile von Szveties acting as the technical director. The company also constructed its own one-way telephone network, independent of the local telephone company, in order to provide a continuous service to subscribers.\n\nIn 1892, Puskás patented, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a telephone switchboard that included relay equipment used to simultaneously transmit telephonic sounds to multiple locations, describing his invention as \"A new method of organizing and fitting a telephone newspaper\". Additional patents were received internationally, including a Canadian grant, issued in 1893, which characterized the invention as a \"Telephonic News Dispenser\".\n\nInitially the \"Telefon Hírmondó\" used telephone lines provided by the local telephone company to distribute its programmes. It later received permission to string its own lines, and, under the guidance of its technical director, Nándor Szmazsenka, constructed a network that divided Budapest into twenty-seven districts. Starting with of wire, the systems expanded to 372 miles (599 km) in 1901, and in 1907. Twenty-seven copper wires ran from microphone receivers in the Opera House to the central office, where the current would pass through a patented device that increased the sound. A main wire ran to each district, with branch wires to individual houses. The distribution to subscribers was regulated by another patented device.\n\nVacuum-tube amplification would not be developed until the 1910s, so there were limited means for producing signals strong enough to be heard throughout the system. Therefore, for transmitting the news, announcers with especially loud voices — known as stentors — were hired and instructed to speak as forcefully as possible into specially designed double-receivers.\n\nHome installations normally consisted of two earphone telephone receivers, connected to long, flexible wires. A subscriber could listen using both earphones, or, alternately, two persons could listen by each using a single earphone. A loud buzzer, strong enough to be heard throughout a room even when the subscriber's receivers were not currently being listened to, was used to draw attention to important announcements. The American author Thomas Denison, who visited Budapest in 1901, found that transmission of spoken news was \"highly satisfactory\", but the audio quality for musical programmes, whether vocal or instrumental, \"still leaves something to be desired\".\n\nSubscribers received programme listings, reviewing the day's schedule, that could be posted on the wall above their receivers. The \"newspaper issue\" began with a news bulletin and newspaper article summaries. The afternoon schedule comprised \"short entertaining stories\", \"sporting intelligence\", and \"filler items\" of various kinds. There were hourly news summaries for those who had missed the earlier bulletins. The evening schedule consisted of theatrical offerings, visits to the opera, poetry readings, concerts, lectures (including repeats of Academy lectures by notable literary figures), and linguistic lessons (in English, Italian and French).\n\nThomas S. Denison wrote in 1901 that the service began transmitting at 10:30 AM, and generally ended at about 10:30 PM, although it ran later in the case of a concert or some other night event. Stock exchange quotations were transmitted from 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM, 11:00 AM to 11:15 AM, 11:30 AM to 11:45 AM, and again in the afternoon hours. Reports of the Reichsrath and political news were given at 11:45 AM to 12:00 PM; when the Reichsrath was not in session, this period was filled by fuller reports of general and foreign news. At 1:30 PM and 6:00 PM a brief summary of news was provided. 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM was filled by concerts, varied by literary criticism, sporting events etc. On Sundays there were special items: news from 11:00 AM to 11:30 AM, and a concert from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM. Thursdays featured a concert for children at 6:00 PM.\n\nW. G. Fitz-Gerald stated the following schedule for a day's typical programme in 1907:\n\nIn addition, special lectures or concerts for children were given once a week, and information for all the principal Hungarian and Austrian horse races was reported as soon as the results were known.\n\nThe \"Telefon Hírmondó\" news collection practices closely followed those commonly employed by print newspapers. A reporter would compose a story and submit it to the chief, who would sign it to fix responsibility. A clerk would then carefully copy the text with lithographic ink onto long galley slips which were transferred to a lithography stone, to be printed in parallel columns 6 inches wide and two feet long (16 cm x 60 cm). Then, two pressmen would take a number of impressions on a roller-movement hand press, using common printing paper. Each sheet was proofread by an assistant editor, with help of a copyholder. The verified sheet comprised part of the daily programme, and was added to the day's file along with the other sheets. A duplicate was cut up into convenient strips for the reading by the stentors.\n\nAlthough the \"Telefon Hírmondó\" had much in common with newspaper publications, it had no leading articles or editorials. The editor alone was responsible in case of action against the paper for libel. By 1901, there had been two or three lawsuits against the editor, and he had prevailed in all the cases. The service exchanged reports with the city newspapers, and the editors and managers of the \"Telefon Hírmondó\" received the same usual courtesies extended to the newspapers, such as passes and free tickets.\n\nIn 1901, the \"Telefon Hírmondó\" employed about 180 people during winter and 150 in the summer. The staff consisted of a business manager, an editor-in-chief, four assistant editors, and nine reporters. The only ladies among the staff were those who sang in the concerts. At this time the service employed six stentors in the winter: four for duty, and two for alternates. Due to the effort required to speak loudly into the transmitters, readers took turns of ten minutes each. The stentors had strong and clear voices with distinct articulation to maintain clarity of sound over the telephone lines. In the summer, four stentors sufficed. In cases where only two stentors were on duty, they took turns of half an hour maximum. By 1907, the system had a staff of over two hundred people, including two business managers, two principal editors, six sub-editors, twelve reporters, and eight stentors.\n\n\"Telefon Hírmondó\" began operations in 1893 with 60 subscribers, a total that grew to 700 in 1894, 4915 in 1895, 7629 in 1899, around 6200 in 1901, and 15,000 by 1907. Some of the notable subscribers included the Emperor Francis Joseph, the Prime Minister Baron Banffy, all the other members of the Hungarian Cabinet, Hungarian author Mór Jókai, and the Mayor of Budapest. The \"Telefon Hírmondó\" appealed strongly to the more intellectual classes. The principal hotels in the city also subscribed to the service, and their guests were free to use the instrument. The service could also be found in other places, including doctors' waiting rooms, barber shops, cafes, restaurants, and dentists' parlours.\n\nThomas S. Denison wrote in the April 1901 issue of \"The World's Work\":\n\nIn 1901, the expenses of the newspaper ranged between 9000 and 10,000 krones per month (a krone was about 42 U.S. cents at that time). The fixed charges (telegrams, salaries, rent etc.) were about 7000 krones a month, and varied with the seasons.\n\nThe annual subscription price of the service was 18 krones (the price of 10 kg sugar or 20 kg coffee in Budapest at that time). A receiver would be put into the subscriber's house at the company's expense. The subscriber was obliged to give security for a year's subscription, one-third of which had to be paid when the equipment was ready for use. The balance had to be paid in two equal installments, at the end of four months and eight months respectively.\n\nShort advertising messages were sandwiched between two interesting news items, so that they would command special attention. In 1901, advertisers were charged one krone for a twelve-second message. The system also experimented with coin-operated receivers located in public places, that took 20-Fillér coins.\n\nIn the 1920s, the company was granted the right to establish the first radio broadcasting station in Budapest, which began operating on 1 December 1925. The combined operations were now known as the \"Magyar Telefon Hirmondó és Rádió\". The services were offered in parallel for some time, both on radio waves and telephone wires. By 1930, \"Telefon Hírmondó\" had started other services, and it had 91079 subscribers. During World War II, the wire network was destroyed, resulting in the cessation of telephone news services.\n\nThe \"Telefon Hírmondó\"'s technology was patented in a number of countries, and in 1910 the rights to its use was licensed for the establishment of the \"Araldo Telefonico\" (Italian for \"Telephone Herald\") in Rome, Italy. By 1914\"Araldo Telefonico\" surpassed 1300 subscribers. The service was interrupted during World War I, and was re-launched in 1922, under the name \"Fonogiornale\".\n\nManley M. Gillam, a former advertising manager of the New York Herald, encountered the \"Telefon Hírmondó\" while touring Hungary, and obtained the American rights. In 1909 he established the United States Telephone Herald Company, which supported associate companies established throughout the United States. Two of these briefly conducted commercial operations: the New Jersey Telephone Herald Company, located in Newark, New Jersey, from 1911 to 1912, and the Oregon Telephone Herald Company, located in Portland, Oregon, during 1912-1913.\n\nThere have been varying opinions whether the \"Telefon Hírmondó\" should be considered the first \"broadcasting\" operation, in part due to differing definitions of the term, including semantic differences, involving issues such as audience size, geographic coverage, and whether the transmission is by wire or wireless. Another factor is the ongoing evolution of the technologies used for the electronic distribution of news and entertainment, including the introduction of radio broadcasting in the early 1920s, followed by wired systems such as cable TV, and still later by hybrid approaches including audio streaming over the Internet.\n\nA 1929 \"Chicago Daily News\" article that reviewed the history of the \"Telefon Hírmondó\" stated that the service's introduction qualified as \"the first broadcasting\". In 1967, reviewing the history of organized distributed audio in general, David L. Woods concluded that \"The \"Telephonic Newspaper\" of Budapest marked the first regular 'broadcasting' operation.\" However, a 1977 analysis of \"broadcasting's oldest stations\" by Joseph E. Baudino and John M. Kittross discounted Woods' conclusion, and explicitly eliminated the \"Telefon Hírmondó\" from consideration, explaining that \"we prefer to restrict ourselves to \"radio\" broadcasting\".\n\nAndrew Orlowski has called the \"Telefon Hírmondó\" service \"a historical antecedent\" of the WAP and mobile data services. Carolyn Marvin states that \"Telefon Hírmondó\" can be seen as a \"proto-broadcasting system\", and An Nguyen notes that it might also fit into the definition of online news as the content was delivered over a point-to-point communication network only to selected users.\n\nUsing news, literary and musical pieces that were transmitted through Telefon Hirmondó in 1897, Első Pesti Egyetemi Rádió, a Budapest based university station, for the first time, reconstructed a full \"broadcast day\". It was transmitted live via telephone from the same room where Telefon Hirmondó operated.\n\n\"Le Journal Téléphonique de Budapest: L'ancêtre de la Radio\" (in French) by Jules Erdoess, \"Radiodiffusion\", number 3, October 1936.\n\n"}

The film was based on the novel \"Le Cinquieme Singe\" by Jacques Zibi. The Cannon Group founder Menahem Golan produced via his 21st Century Film Corporation, following the demise of Cannon.\n\nThe original music score was composed by Robert O. Ragland.\n\nCunda (Kingsley) lives deep in the Brazilian rainforest and is intent on making enough money so he can marry a widow in his village. However, his trade - capturing snakes for scientists - pays very little money, and he's in direct competition with other suitors.\n\nOne day, Cunda is bitten by a snake, and he crawls to the river to recover. While going through the agonizing recovery, he has an hallucination of four chimpanzees sitting in the river. Recovered, he returns home and finds the four chimpanzees waiting for him, and his efforts to shoo them away fail. Knowing that chimpanzees are not native to Brazil, he decides that they are a kind of supernatural gift for him. Believing this, he decides to take them to \"the city\" to sell them.\n\nThe journey isn't easy from the start; he discovers that he can't tie them on a rope and drag them, and the only way is to coax them. They stumble into a gold-panning camp, where Cunda is forced to work in order to pay off an old debt. When one of the monkeys is taken as payment, Cunda must figure how to retrieve the monkey and escape. Later, he, the monkeys and the adults of a village are kidnapped by mercenaries. Cunda and the monkeys escape, along with a village woman who refuses to leave his side. Arriving at a small town, a confusing sequence results in one of the monkeys disappearing, and Cunda becoming the servant of the local rich woman who has taken it upon herself to take care of the monkeys. Cunda now has to solve these two problems, and deal with the fact of the village woman's attraction to him plus his growing fondness of the monkeys.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "340996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=340996", "title": "The Kliq", "text": "The Kliq\n\nThe Kliq was a backstage group in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) during the mid-1990s, composed of Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Sean Waltman, and for a short time Justin Credible. Several of the men, most notably Michaels, Nash, and Hall, wielded an immense amount of power within the company at the time, which they used to positively influence one another's careers.\n\nIn May 1996, The Kliq broke character at a live event at Madison Square Garden in an unscripted incident referred to as the \"Curtain Call\", which had far-reaching ramifications for the WWF specifically and the wrestling world as a whole. At a time when professional wrestling organizations worked to maintain the illusion of storylines and characters, the Curtain Call marked the first time that such high-profile performers had so publicly broken character, forcing the WWF and other wrestling organizations to begin acknowledging the scripted elements of their programming.\n\nThe Kliq was also the primary catalyst for two of the most well known stables in wrestling history: the New World Order (nWo) in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and the WWF/E, and D-Generation X (DX) in the WWF/E. Of the Kliq, Michaels and Waltman would serve in both groups; Triple H was a member of DX while Nash and Hall performed with the nWo.\n\nThe Kliq was formed in 1994 by real-life best friends Scott Hall (then known as Razor Ramon), Kevin Nash (Diesel), Michael Hickenbottom (Shawn Michaels) and Sean Waltman (1-2-3 Kid). In January 1995, Paul Levesque left WCW and arrived in the WWF as Hunter Hearst Helmsley (Triple H) and became the next member of The Kliq. Each man enjoyed a tremendous amount of popularity with fans, which allotted them a particular degree of control over their own careers. Nash, Hall, and Michaels, then among the company's most popular performers, came up with the idea of forming a backstage alliance, which would potentially allow them to consolidate even more power within the company. Bret Hart, another of the company's top performers at the time, claims in his autobiography \"Hitman\" that he was also asked if he wanted to be part of The Kliq, but declined the offer: \"The thing I remember most about that tour was Shawn, Razor, and Nash talking to me in Hamburg about the idea of forming a clique of top guys who strictly took care of their own\". Levesque mentioned on the 2013 \"Triple H – Thy Kingdom Come\" DVD that he was recruited to the Kliq by Kevin Nash because he didn't do drugs or alcohol, and thus could serve as the group's designated driver after events.\n\nMichaels claims that the name \"The Kliq\" was originally coined by Lex Luger, due to the closeness of the five friends backstage. Although, Lex Luger had suggested that Davey Boy Smith created the name, because the five kept \"clicking\", referring to how often they talked. At the suggestion of Vince Russo, Michaels began referring to his fans as his \"Kliq\". Michaels wrote in his 2006 autobiography that he disliked the idea, and that it \"was not a huge hit\" with the fans.\n\nIn 1995, the men's growing popularity as performers led to the group developing a heavy influence on booking– the power to schedule matches and decide match outcomes, write storylines, and largely determine the trajectory of other performers' careers. The group used this power to give one another preferential treatment, usually scheduling each other in heavily promoted, high-profile matches, often against one another: During the period of 1994 through 1996 particularly, Ramon had high-profile feuds with 1-2-3 Kid, Diesel, and Michaels, while Diesel and Michaels formed a championship-winning tag-team called Two Dudes with Attitudes.\n\nThe group's perceived abuse of power led to animosity amongst other wrestlers, particularly lower-ranking members of the company. In one instance, performer Carl Ouellet, then performing as Jean-Pierre Lafitte, claimed that his scheduled defeat of Diesel-- an event which would have marked an upturn in his own popularity and proven to be a turning point in his career-- was vetoed by Michaels, leading to a backstage confrontation between Ouellet and Michaels. The match between the two ended in a double-countout because Lafitte refused to be pinned by Nash. In retaliation, the group effectively ended Ouellet's career with the company by scheduling him to repeatedly lose low-profile matches. In his autobiography, Michaels said that \"we (The Kliq) buried him (Ouellet).\" Lafitte left the company soon after the incident; contrary to rumors, Michaels says that WWF Chairman Vince McMahon did not fire Lafitte.\n\nIn April 1996, Nash and Hall signed contracts with WCW, the WWF's top competitor, with whom the company was embroiled in a bitter rivalry. Accounts have differed as to what led to the men's departure: Wrestling commentators have speculated that their contracts were allowed to expire in order to cripple The Kliq's influence in the company, while official WWE media asserts that Nash and Hall were simply offered more money by WCW than the WWF was able to promise them at the time.\n\nNash and Hall's last contracted match for the WWF took place on May 19, 1996 at Madison Square Garden. At the time, Levesque and Nash were wrestling as villains, while Michaels and Hall were fan favorites. At the end of the night, Michaels wrestled Nash in a steel cage match. Immediately after the match, Ramon entered the ring and hugged Michaels; this was not seen as unusual in-story, as both wrestlers were fan favorites. However, Levesque then entered the ring and hugged Hall, followed by Nash. The four wrestlers then group hugged for several seconds before they turned to face the crowd with their arms raised together. Waltman, who himself would leave for WCW shortly after the incident, was in drug rehab at the time and thus didn't participate.\nTheir actions – dubbed the \"Curtain Call\" – scandalized WWF management. At the time, most major wrestling promotions, the WWF included, prided themselves on maintaining kayfabe – the illusion that all of the events which transpired in-ring were real and unscripted, and that wrestlers' on-screen rivalries extended outside of the ring. The company had a strict policy of onscreen rivals not breaking character by associating with one another on WWF programming, as a means of maintaining storylines and feuds between wrestlers, which sometimes lasted for years and could unravel in seconds if the two feuding wrestlers were seen associating as friends in public. WWF Chairman Vince McMahon was reported to have initially given his tacit approval for a \"farewell\" ceremony, but did not realize that it would become so elaborate. The severity of the incident was further compounded by the revelation that the event-- which was not broadcast on television-- had been filmed by two fans, Mani Mohtadi and Jason Cosmides, who had smuggled a camcorder past security. Stills from the footage were widely disseminated online and in wrestling magazines at the time, bringing the Curtain Call to a wider audience than if it had not been recorded.\n\nBecause Hall and Nash had already confirmed their departure for WCW, they escaped punishment. Michaels, who was the WWF World Heavyweight Champion at the time and one of the promotion's biggest drawing performers, could not be punished. The punishment fell solely on Levesque, who was demoted from being a championship contender to wrestling inexperienced or lesser experienced wrestlers for the next several months. He did, however, win the WWF Intercontinental Championship five months later. Levesque's unquestioning acceptance of his punishment had the unintended side effect of rehabilitating his image in the eyes of other performers who held a grudge against him for his time with the Kliq: according to The Undertaker in \"HHH: The Game\" DVD that when Levesque first arrived in the WWF, he was perceived of as arrogant and self-centered, but that by accepting his punishment, he earned legitimate respect.\n\nThe incident turned out to have a major impact on the WWF's future. For the first time in modern pro-wrestling history, a major company was forced to acknowledge that its events were scripted; McMahon would later use this to his advantage in the development of several meta-storylines, including a skit on the October 6, 1997 episode of \"Raw Is War\" in which Michaels and Levesque, both in character, played footage of the Curtain Call incident. Before the Curtain Call, Levesque had been booked into the finals of the 1996 King of the Ring tournament during the following summer, but his place – and the push that usually went with it – would instead go to Stone Cold Steve Austin, igniting his , an event which ultimately helped the WWF defeat WCW in the Monday Night Wars. Levesque's acceptance of his punishment and the respect it earned him resulted in him only suffering short-term repercussions. He would go on to win the following year's King of the Ring tournament and later went on to become a 14-time world champion, beginning with his WWF Championship victory over Mankind the night after SummerSlam in 1999. Unrelated to the Curtain Call aftermath, Levesque would later go on to marry McMahon's daughter, Stephanie, and take a significant role in the day-to-day business dealings of the company.\n\nWhen Hall and Nash went to WCW, they formed The Outsiders tag team, as well as the New World Order (nWo) stable alongside Hulk Hogan. Rather than see the breaking of kayfabe as a crisis moment for professional wrestling, the WCW decided to exploit it by introducing their own meta-storyline that incorporated fans' growing awareness of the backstage politics of pro-wrestling: Upon Nash and Hall's arrival, they were implied to still be working for the WWF, staging an \"invasion\" of the WCW.\n\nWhen Waltman later jumped to WCW, he also joined the nWo as Syxx, often working closely with the Outsiders and forming the trio known as the Wolfpac. Many fans criticized Kevin Nash for his booking tenure in WCW since it displayed the same self-promoting behavior associated with The Kliq on an even larger scale. Fans often pointed to Nash booking himself to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship from the then-undefeated Goldberg and the subsequent match with Hogan as the most grievous of his \"offenses\". Nash, however, claims that he did not have booking power at the time of the incident. Nash's innocence claim is disputed in several shoot interviews by various WCW wrestlers from the time who claimed that he, Hogan and several others often refused to put other wrestlers over in order to keep themselves as the main stars.\nMeanwhile, Michaels and Levesque began to persuade WWF management to let them pair up on screen, but management was hesitant and wanted to keep The Kliq separated on-screen. They eventually aligned together in the faction D-Generation X (DX), with Levesque's \"Hunter Hearst Helmsley\" fictional persona gradually transformed and re-dubbed Triple H or HHH, and alongside Levesque's then-girlfriend and on-screen female \"bodyguard\" Chyna. Rick Rude also temporarily joined the group (as a sort of on-screen bodyguard for Michaels), though his membership ended when he signed with WCW after his WWF contract expired in early November 1997.\n\nDX eventually became as influential to the Monday Night Wars as the nWo. DX's antics also went on to help spark The Attitude Era in the WWF. After Sean Waltman was fired from WCW, he was hired by WWF and joined DX, replacing the injured Michaels. The nWo's hand sign, often referred to as the \"Wolf Head\", was originally used by the Kliq members in the WWF. Waltman introduced the hand symbol to the nWo, Hall and Nash brought the hand sign with them, and it became widely used by the nWo members and fans worldwide.\n\nOn the October 6, 1997 \"Raw Is War\", Shawn Michaels alluded to this off-screen connection. After Bret Hart claimed to have destroyed the Kliq and to have \"run [Scott Hall and Kevin Nash] outta town\", Michaels declared, \"The Kliq owns this [professional wrestling] business\", and said that it had really undergone \"expansion\" rather than \"destruction\". During a brief period in 1998, after Waltman's return to the WWF as X-Pac, in promos the members of D-Generation X made numerous references to their \"friends\" in the WCW. On the April 27, 1998 \"Raw\" (recorded live in Hampton, Virginia), DX (by now composed of Triple H, Waltman, Billy Gunn, Road Dogg and Chyna) staged a mock \"invasion\" protest/paramilitary take-over of the nearby Norfolk Scope, where \"Nitro\" was being held. Triple H, riding in a M38, chanted \"Let our people go!\" through a megaphone during the incident. Waltman called out, \"We just wanted to say 'what's up' to our boys Kevin Nash and Scott Hall\". DX also led a chant of \"WCW sucks\" by fans outside the arena who had tickets to the show (some of whom, Triple H alleged, had been given free tickets to \"Nitro\" by WCW in order to boost crowd numbers).\n\nIn 2002, after WCW had gone out of business, The nWo was reformed in the WWF with Hall, Nash and Hogan, the group's initial members. Hogan soon left the group after being attacked by Nash and Hall as a result of his turning into a fan favorite at WrestleMania X8. Other former members, including Big Show and Waltman, joined the group. Later, Shawn Michaels – after years away from the ring –was introduced by Kevin Nash as the newest member of the nWo, and Michaels promised the rest of the group that he would soon deliver Triple H. After weeks of lobbying for Triple H's services, a backstage promo of The nWo wishing Triple H luck before the match aired. This included 4 members of The Kliq (Shawn, Kevin, Pac and Triple H), as Big Show appeared wishing Triple H good luck as well. The nWo told Triple H to \"throw up the hand signal\" if he needed any help out there. Shortly thereafter, Nash suffered a torn quadriceps (after returning the same night after time off due to a biceps injury) during a ten-man tag-team match, and the following week Vince McMahon disbanded The nWo. Eric Bischoff (acting as the Raw brand General Manager) later tried to make Michaels Triple H's manager. This led to a short-lived reformation of DX, as Triple H turned on him the same night, setting off a long and heated feud that took approximately two years to resolve. The year after, Nash returned from injury as a fan favorite and sided with Michaels against Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair, Batista and Randy Orton).\n\nMichaels and Triple H have reformed D-Generation X, first returning together for a six-month stint on the June 12, 2006 edition of Monday Night Raw. They would feud against The Spirit Squad (Kenny, Johnny, Mitch, Nicky, and Mikey), Big Show and Vince McMahon, and later the team of Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton), until Triple H's legitimate knee injury in the beginning of 2007. They would reform again on August 2009 during Shawn Michaels' last year in the WWE. During this year, D-Generation X would capture the Unified WWE Tag Team Championships at against Jericho and Big Show, which would become the start of the first and only title reign for Triple H and Shawn Michaels as a tag team. D-Generation X would later go on to disband in March 2010 (after losing the tag Team titles to Big Show and The Miz). Michaels would then focus heavily on ending the winning streak of The Undertaker at WrestleMania, having failed to do so at WrestleMania XXV, and he would put his career on the line for their second WrestleMania encounter at WrestleMania XXVI which he would go on to lose and therefore end his career.\n\nHall, Nash and Waltman (then working for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling) would reform the nWo in a stable called The Band, where Hall and Nash won the TNA World Tag Team Championship, but Hall and Waltman were released shortly after (and Nash's contract would expire later on in the year).\n\nOn April 2, 2011, The Kliq, consisting of Nash, Waltman, Triple H and Shawn Michaels, made a special appearance as Shawn Michaels was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame 2011. Scott Hall decided not to attend the Hall of Fame ceremony or other WrestleMania XXVII festivities due to concerns of remaining sober. Hall has battled many drug and alcohol problems and suffered from various health problems in the past years and credits his friends in The Kliq for helping him through his battles. In 2014, at the conclusion of Scott Hall's Hall of Fame induction, the members of The Kliq joined him onstage and reunited for the 1st time since the curtain call incident. They reunited again in 2015 on an episode of Raw, and then again at Nash's Hall Of Fame induction.\n\nA December 2014 episode of WWE Network show \"The Monday Night War: WWE vs. WCW\" focused on The Kliq.\n\nAlthough the core group of The Kliq has long been known there have always been rumours, suggestions and unofficial members either within the group or on the fringes looking in. The most consistently mentioned name is that of Peter Polaco who at the time of The Kliq's formation was working for WWF as Aldo Montoya and would later go on to gain fame as Justin Credible in Extreme Championship Wrestling. He apparently became friends with Scott Hall who offered to mentor him and from there he ended up travelling with the rest of the group until he negotiated his WWF release in 1997. Polaco's association with the group is also lent weight by the fact that upon his return to WWF after the closure of ECW in 2001 he instantly aligned himself on TV with X-Pac with the two going on to form a short lived stable under the name of X-Factor along with Albert as the group's enforcer.\n\nAnother name that has had a long association with The Kliq is that of Louie Spicolli, who was wrestling for the WWF in the early to mid 90's under the name of Rad Radford. Spicolli's friendship with the group, much like Polaco's, descends from Scott Hall taking the youngster under his wing and having him travel with the rest of them on the road. Spicolli left the WWF after only a few months when he was released to deal with issues that he was having with substance abuse at the time. During this time, Spicolli worked for ECW for a number of months, during which time he could be seen using the now infamous \"Wolf Head\" signal during tapings and matches. In a later interview he denied the association, and asserted that the \"Wolf Head\" symbol was originally Bret Hart's gesture and The Wolfpac stole it. He said he used the symbol in ECW in order to \"take it back.\" In late 1997, Spicolli returned to the spotlight by signing with WCW and was soon placed on screen as the lackey of Scott Hall, with the two engaging in a feud with Larry Zbyszko. However, the feud was never able to finish due to Spicolli's untimely death from a drug overdose at the age of 27. His death was never publicly acknowledged by any member of the group at the time, with only Zbyszko mentioning it on screen.\n\nPrior to her death in 2016, Chyna had association to the group, not only as an original member of D-Generation X, but also through her relationship with Triple H, along with another long-term relationship with Sean Waltman. Her link to The Kliq was unclear, with the details of her split from Triple H in 2000 never made public. Her relationship to Waltman was notorious for the release of a sextape in 2004 and Chyna being arrested for domestic assault in 2005 after a drug-fueled fight. It was thought the pair were no longer on speaking terms after going their separate ways to deal with a number of personal issues, including drug and alcohol addictions, as well as issues with depression. When Triple H was asked in 2015 about inducting Chyna into the WWE Hall of Fame, he cited the conflict between her work in the adult industry and WWE's current target audience as a reason it would not happen. However, when both Triple H and his wife Stephanie McMahon were asked the same question after Chyna died, they were both in favor of inducting her.\nOther people in the business have often had their names dropped into the hat but have never said either way whether they consider themselves to be a part of the group. The highest profile of these is probably Sid Eudy, better known as Sycho Sid or Sid Vicious. Another high-profile name is Rick Rude, who was both a member of the original D-Generation X and the nWo. Rude was involved in an incident in which he appeared on both \"Nitro\" and \"Raw\" in the same night, protesting on Nitro about the treatment of Bret Hart during the Montreal Screwjob (Rude actually appeared on the live \"Nitro\" show clean shaven and with a mustache an hour before appearing on \"Raw\" (which was taped a week earlier) with a full beard). How this affected his standing in the group is unclear, however it has gone on record that prior to his death Rude was one of the most respected people in the business by members of The Kliq.\n\nKonnan is said to have enjoyed a very close friendship with both Nash and Hall during his run in WCW and was a member of both the nWo and the Wolfpac. Konnan was also influential in bringing in Sean Waltman to AAA for his run with the company throughout 2007 and 2008, with the two aligning on screen for a while as a part of La Legión Extranjera. Curt Hennig, who was once a tag team partner of Hall during their days in the AWA, is also said to have had a long-running friendship with the group, and spent large amounts of his career working either with or against members of the group in various promotions.\n\nThe Bullet Club stable seen in New Japan Pro Wrestling and Ring of Honor pay homage to The Kliq by using the Wolfpac hand symbol, as well as the use of the \"2 Sweet\" catchphrase and the DX-style crotch chops. Its WWE offshoot, The Club, also uses the Wolfpac hand symbol. Bullet Club members Adam Cole and The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) also created a subgroup named Superkliq.\n\n"}

Its title is a reference to the 2010 \"Tonight Show\" host and timeslot conflict, which resulted in O'Brien resigning from his position as host of \"The Tonight Show\" in January 2010. O'Brien reached a settlement with NBC that barred him from appearing on television until September 2010, but it did not bar him from performing before a live audience in a concert setting. From April through June 2010, O'Brien performed 42 shows in the United States and Canada.\n\nO'Brien announced on March 11, 2010 via his Twitter account that he would embark on a 30-city live tour beginning April 12. Even with the unconventional marketing campaign of a single Twitter announcement, many locations sold out within hours of the tweet and additional shows were added on to meet demand. During the tour, O'Brien announced that his new show, \"Conan\", would debut on TBS in November 2010. A documentary following O'Brien during the tour, \"Conan O'Brien Can't Stop\", was released in June 2011.\n\nIn January 2010, late-night talk show hosts Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno engaged in a public relations conflict over who should host \"The Tonight Show\". Due to low ratings for \"The Jay Leno Show\" and \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\", NBC announced a schedule change, moving Leno from 10:00 pm to 11:30 pm, and O'Brien from 11:30 pm to 12:00 am. This change resulted in a public outcry and public demonstrations largely in support of O'Brien. O'Brien indicated that he would quit his show and leave the network if NBC were to implement it, citing the \"destruction\" of the venerable franchise which had aired at or around 11:30 pm for over 60 years.\n\nAs part of the deal between O'Brien and NBC, O'Brien was legally prohibited from appearing on television prior to September 1, 2010. He began to utilize social media to remain engaged with his fan base. O'Brien started a Twitter account on February 24, 2010. After about one hour, O'Brien's subscriber list had reached over 30,000 members and, approximately 30 minutes later, he was on the brink of passing 50,000 followers. After 24 hours, O'Brien had well over 300,000 followers. In late May 2010, he surpassed the one million mark for number of Twitter followers.\n\nO'Brien announced via his Twitter account that he would embark on a 30-city live tour on March 11, 2010, beginning on April 12, 2010. On the same day, teamcoco.com, an official website, was launched. According to TMZ, O'Brien decided not to keep any of the proceeds from the tour, in order to employ his show's staff members.\n\nSeveral members of O'Brien's staff joined him for the tour, including sidekick Andy Richter, and the former Tonight Show Band, temporarily renamed \"The Legally Prohibited Band\". Max Weinberg, the band leader, was unable to participate in the tour due to his recent heart surgery, although he did appear at one of the New York City shows.\n\nSigns at each venue encouraged audience members using Twitter during the show to use a unique hashtag. Reggie Watts served as the tour's opening act. In the video introduction to the show, Conan appeared as an obese and bearded version of himself struggling to cope with the loss of his talk show while Eric Carmen's \"All By Myself\" plays. He then transforms back into his thin self during his exercise montage (by merely pulling off his body suit) after getting the call to go on tour.\n\nThe tour differed from his television shows in that there was no desk or celebrity interviews, but presented as more of a variety show than a stand-up routine. Many elements from TV were incorporated into the show, including video bits, musical and comic performers, and cameo appearances by celebrities. Classic sketches were also revived for the tour, albeit under different names due to legal issues over the ownership rights. The Masturbating Bear, for example, made a brief appearance before being transformed into the Self-Pleasuring Panda. Also, the \"\"Walker, Texas Ranger\" lever\" was retitled the \"Chuck Norris Rural Policeman Handle\". Triumph the Insult Comic Dog mocked the city the tour was appearing in as himself in a prerecorded bit that inserts information about the city by dubbing over the original audio. O'Brien also introduced a giant inflatable bat he claimed to have purchased during Meat Loaf's \"Bat Out of Hell\" tour and at one point walked onstage wearing a replica of Eddie Murphy's purple suit from his comedy special \"Eddie Murphy Raw\". In addition, O'Brien performed music throughout the show, including the disco hit \"I Will Survive\" and a personal parody of \"On the Road Again\".\n\n\n\nThis show is a part of the \"Bonnaroo Music Festival\"\n\nJust hours before the first show of the tour, O'Brien announced that he would host a new show on cable station TBS, titled \"Conan\", which debuted in November 2010. In addition to the announcement of the television series, TBS also announced a one-hour TBS Special, featuring several writers for \"Conan\", as well Watts.\n\nEven with ticket prices starting at $40, The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour sold out. Footage of O'Brien's tour has been uploaded onto YouTube by fans in attendance and immediately went viral. A clip of O'Brien's performance of \"I Will Survive\", for example, has received more than 320,000 views.\n\n\"Conan O'Brien Can't Stop\", a behind-the-scenes documentary film shot during the tour, was released in June 2011. It focuses on the production of the tour, O'Brien's interactions with fans and his crew, and O'Brien's thoughts on the \"Tonight Show\" conflict and legal injunction that inspired the tour. The movie was filmed, directed and produced by director Rodman Flender, a college friend of O'Brien.\n\n"}
{"id": "19165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19165", "title": "The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)", "text": "The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)\n\n\"The Spanish Inquisition\" is a series of sketches in \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", Series 2 Episode 2, first broadcast 22 September 1970, parodying the real-life Spanish Inquisition. This episode is itself entitled \"The Spanish Inquisition\". The sketches are notable for their principal catchphrase, \"Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!\", which has become a frequently-used quote. The end of the sketch uses music from the composition Devil's Galop by Charles Williams. Rewritten audio versions of the sketches were included on \"Another Monty Python Record\" in 1971.\n\nThis is a recurring sketch always predicated on an unrelated sketch in which one character mentions that they \"didn't expect a Spanish Inquisition!\", often in irritation at being questioned by another. The first appearance of the Spanish Inquisition occurs in a drawing room set in \"Jarrow, 1912\". A mill worker (Graham Chapman) enters the room and tells a woman sitting on a couch knitting (Carol Cleveland) that \"one of the cross beams has gone out askew on the treadle\". When she says she doesn't know what he's talking about, the mill worker gets defensive and says, \"I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition!\" Then the Inquisition — consisting of Cardinal Ximénez (Michael Palin) and his assistants, Cardinal Biggles (Terry Jones) (who resembles his namesake Biggles wearing a leather aviator's helmet and goggles) and Cardinal Fang (Terry Gilliam) — burst into the room to the sound of a jarring musical sting. Ximénez shouts, with a particular and high-pitched emphasis on the first word: \"NO-body expects the Spanish Inquisition!\"\n\nAfter entering, Ximénez begins listing their weapons (\"fear, surprise, ruthless efficiency\"), but interrupts himself as he keeps forgetting to mention additional weapons and has to begin his list over again. After several attempts, Ximénez states that he will come in again, and herds the Inquisition back off the set. The straight man mill worker repeats the cue line, the Inquisition bursts back in (complete with jarring chord), and the introduction is tried anew. But Ximénez fails again and tries to get Cardinal Biggles to do the introduction, but Biggles is also unsuccessful.\n\nXiménez decides to forget the introduction and has Cardinal Fang read out charges of heresy against the woman. The woman pleads innocent, and the cardinals respond with laughter (as an on-screen caption reads \"DIABOLICAL LAUGHTER\") and threats (as the on-screen caption changes to \"DIABOLICAL ACTING\"). Ximénez intends to torture the woman with \"the rack\", but Cardinal Biggles instead produces a dish-drying rack. This rack is tied to the woman as Biggles pretends to turn a lever, but it has no effect whatsoever.\n\nThe Inquisition returns in a later sketch as an older woman (Marjorie Wilde) shares photographs with another woman (Cleveland), who rips them up as they are handed to her. When the older woman presents a photo of the Spanish Inquisition hiding behind the coal shed, the other woman says, \"I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition!\" The three cardinals then reappear and take the older woman away to a dungeon.\n\nBiggles tries to torture the woman by poking her repeatedly with soft cushions. When this fails, Ximénez orders Fang to get \"the comfy chair\", which is brought out and the woman placed in it. Ximénez states that she must stay in the chair \"until lunch time with only a cup of coffee at 11\", and begins to shout at her to confess – only to have Biggles break down and confess. This frustrates Ximénez, but he cannot complain about it since he is distracted by a cartoon character from the next scene.\n\nAt the end of the show, in the \"Court Charades\" sketch, a judge (Jones) who is also a defendant in an obscenity trial at the Old Bailey is casually sentenced by another judge (Chapman) to be burned at the stake. The convicted judge responds, \"Blimey, I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition!\" The whole court rises and looks expectantly at the witness entrance door. As the closing credits of the episode begin, the Inquisitors race out of a house and hop on a double-decker bus to the Old Bailey, all to the tune of \"Devil's Galop\". As the Inquisitors ride in the bus, they comment worriedly that they are running out of credits (which are seen on screen) and are panicked that the sketch will soon end. The bus reaches the courthouse and the cardinals charge up the steps of the Old Bailey. They finally burst into the now empty courtroom, only for Ximénez to shout, \"NO-body expects the Span-oh, bugger.\", as the words \"THE END\" appear on-screen.\n\nIn the \"Monty Python Live (Mostly)\" stage show the sketch ends when Ximénez orders Biggles to \"torture\" the victim (who is sitting in the comfy chair) by giving her a glass of cold milk from the fridge. When Biggles opens the door, the Man in the Fridge (Eric Idle) emerges and begins singing the \"Galaxy Song\" to the victim, while the Inquisition exit through the fridge.\n\nCardinal Ximénez briefly appears two episodes later (\"The Buzz Aldrin Show\") in a vox pop, again displaying difficulty counting (in this instance, the kinds of aftershave he uses). Later in that episode during the \"Police Constable Pan Am Sketch\", the policeman tells a chemist \"one more peep out of you and I'll do you for heresy\", with the chemist (played by Palin) responding that he \"didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition\"; except that instead of the Spanish Inquisition arriving, PC Pan Am (played by Graham Chapman) simply tells the chemist to shut up.\n\n"}
