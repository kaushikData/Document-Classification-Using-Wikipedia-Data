{"id": "44783823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44783823", "title": "Alex + Ada", "text": "Alex + Ada\n\nAlex + Ada is an American comic book series created by Jonathan Luna and Sarah Vaughn. The duo began work on the series in January 2013, before publishing 15 issues through Image Comics between November 2013 and June 2015. The series has since been collected into three trade paperbacks.\n\n\"Alex + Ada\" centers upon the relationship between a lonely man and an intelligent android. The series received positive reviews from critics who compared it to other popular science fiction stories, although Luna's artwork was sometimes criticized for being simplistic.\n\nJonathan Luna had previously created comics with his brother Joshua, but was exhausted after six straight years of work. Inspired by a TED Talk, he decided to take a break from working. During his two years away from comics, he painted \"Star Bright and the Looking Glass\", a fairy tale picture book that was proofread by his friend Sarah Vaughn and published in 2012.\n\nWhile working on the picture book, Luna realized he missed telling a story panel by panel and decided to return to comics. He and his brother had decided to work on separate projects, so Luna pitched the idea of a young man who falls in love with a female android to Vaughn over dinner. Vaughn, who began writing and drawing romance comics in her youth, jumped at the opportunity.\n\nAfter initializing the concept in January 2013, the two discussed the project for three or four months before creating an outline for the whole story. The original outline was for 12 issues, but it left room for improvisation and a few points were removed as the story progressed. They looked at past and present social movements for civil rights for inspiration for how one would progress and how people might respond to a movement for android rights. Luna wrote the first draft of issue one, then the two worked together to rewrite it.\n\nLuna began drawing around April. \"Alex + Ada\" is the first comic Luna drew completely digitally. Because Luna needed to focus on art, Vaughn wrote the first draft of the remaining issues. She and Luna would discuss the draft, then she would rewrite it.\n\nThe first issue of \"Alex + Ada\" was released November 6, 2013, and was Vaughn's first published comic work. It was the 141st best selling issue of the month with estimated sales around 15,000, which was more than any book Luna had done previously. During the course of publication, the series length was increased from 12 issues to 15 issues. Each issue was released approximately six weeks apart, with the final issue available June 18, 2015. Issue 15 was the 206th best selling issue of the month with estimated orders around 8,250. The series has been collected into three trade paperbacks, each containing five issues.\n\nAlex is a young man who is depressed after his fiancée breaks up with him. Tired of seeing him unhappy, Alex's grandmother sends him Ada, a Tanaka X-5 android which is capable of intelligent human interaction. The robot is initially incapable of self-awareness, as each android has a program that blocks any potential free thought or consciousness.\n\nAlex decides to remove this program and grant Ada her own mental freedom, as he is uninterested in a partner who cannot truly interact with him. Because removing the program is illegal and carries harsh consequences for both Ada and Alex, they have to pretend Ada is not self-aware. When a jealous love-interest of Alex reports Ada as sentient to the FBI, Alex and Ada attempt to flee the country. When they are intercepted by the FBI, Ada gets shot by the police and Alex is arrested. He is convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison, but Ada is not found to be sentient.\n\nDuring his time in prison, rights are granted to sentient robots. On Alex's release, Ada is returned to him. She appears to be non-sentient, but Alex discovers she locked her consciousness to protect him. He restores her freedom and is re-united with her.\n\nAccording to review aggregator Comic Book Round Up, critics gave the first issue an average 8.0/10 and the series as a whole 8.5/10. During its publication, \"Alex + Ada\" appeared on many \"best of\" lists created by comic news websites.\n\nReviewing for Bleeding Cool, Zac Thompson and David Dissanayake made favorable comparisons to the 1982 film \"Blade Runner\" and the 2013 film \"Her\". Dissanayake also noted the entertaining realism, as it \"feels like our world, full of technologies that...will [exist] very soon.\" Comic Book Resources' Sonia Harris also praised the series for its realism, writing the \"metaphor of artificially intelligent beings living out their secret lives, unsafe and insecure, yet potentially stronger and smarter than humans is potent.\" Dean Stell, a reviewer for Weekly Comic Book Review, said Luna and Vaughn created \"a wonderful and classically-themed science-fiction story.\" Writing for Bloody Disgusting, Lonnie Nadler said Luna's work on facial expressions was the \"major highlight\" of his illustrations.\n\nLuna's simplistic artwork is a frequent point of criticism among reviewers, although some call it appropriate for the setting. In addition to Luna's \"painfully plain\" illustrations, Newsarama's David Pepose also criticized the story's pace.\n"}
{"id": "2045528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045528", "title": "Ashcan copy", "text": "Ashcan copy\n\nAn ashcan copy is a type of American comic book publication created solely to establish trademarks on potential titles and not intended for sale, which was done in the 1930s and 1940s when the comic book industry was in its infancy. The term was revived in the 1980s by Bob Burden, who used the term for prototypes of his self-published comic book. Since the 1990s, it has been used to describe promotional materials produced in large print runs and made available for mass consumption. In the film and television industries, the term has been adopted for low-grade material created to preserve a claim to licensed property rights.\n\nIn the 1930s, the modern comic book was created and rapidly grew in popularity. In the competition to secure trademarks on titles intended to sound thrilling, publishers like All-American Publications and Fawcett Comics developed the ashcan edition, which was the same size as regular comics and usually had a black and white cover. Typically, cover art was recycled from previous publications with a new title pasted to it. Interior artwork ranged from previously published material in full color to unfinished pencils without word balloons. Not all of the titles secured through ashcan editions were actually used for regular publications.\nThe purpose of the ashcan editions was to fool the US Patent & Trademark Office into believing the book had actually been published. Clerks at the office would accept the hastily produced material as legitimate, granting the submitting publisher a trademark to the title. Since the ashcans had no other use, publishers printed as few as two copies; one was sent to the Trademark Office, the other was kept for their files. Occasionally, publishers would send copies to distributors or wholesalers by registered mail to further establish publication dates, but nearly all ashcan comic editions were limited to five copies or less.\n\nAfter being accepted by the Trademark Office, the ashcans were meant to be thrown away. At the time, waste containers were commonly called \"ash cans\" because they were used to hold soot and ash from wood and coal heating systems. The term was applied to these editions of comics because they had no value. However, some spare copies were given to editors and other employees to keep as souvenirs. The practice of creating and submitting ashcans was abandoned when publishers began to consider it an unnecessary effort that was used by lawyers to justify a fee. Because of their rarity, ashcans from this era are desired by collectors and often fetch a high price.\n\nIn the 1980s, Bob Burden was a dealer and collector of Golden Age comic books who was aware of ashcan comics. He was also the creator of a comic character, Flaming Carrot, who starred in \"Flaming Carrot Comics\" published by Aardvark-Vanaheim beginning in 1984. For each issue, Burden had magazine-sized prototype editions printed and shared them with friends and people who assisted with production. Some were also sent to retailers as advance previews to generate interest in his comic. Fewer than 40 copies of each prototype were made, and Burden described them as ashcans.\n\nIn 1992, Rob Liefeld applied the term to two digest-sized prototype versions of \"Youngblood\" #1, but this ashcan was created for mass release. Instead of denoting the material as worthless, Liefeld's usage implied rarity and collectability. This ashcan was the first publication from Image Comics, a new publisher started by popular artists during a boom period for comic books. The sales success of the \"Youngblood\" ashcans prompted imitation, and for the next year nearly every new Image series had a corresponding ashcan. The typical print run for Image ashcans was between 500 and 5,000. Soon, other publishers began using the idea in a variety of sizes and formats. In 1993, Triumphant Comics advertised ashcan editions of new properties with print runs of 50,000.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the speculation market in comics in the mid-1990s, the term has been used for promotional books. Established publishers such as Dark Horse Comics, IDW Publishing, and DC Comics continue to use ashcan copies as part of their marketing plan for new titles. Aspiring creators also apply the term to hand-stapled photocopied books they use to demonstrate their abilities to hiring editors at comic book conventions or as part of a submissions package.\n\nThe term has been appropriated by the film and television industries to refer to low-quality material made specifically to preserve rights to a licensed character, which often expire if unused for a set period of time. One of the earliest examples of this practice is the 1966 animated adaptation of \"The Hobbit\". Other prominent examples include \"\", a 2015 adaptation of \"The Wheel of Time\", and the unreleased Fantastic Four film from 1994.\n"}

{"id": "14592469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14592469", "title": "Cat play and toys", "text": "Cat play and toys\n\nCat play and toys incorporates predatory games of \"play aggression\". Cats' behaviors when playing are similar to hunting behaviors. These activities allow kittens and younger cats to grow and acquire cognitive and motor skills, and to socialize with other cats. Cat play behavior can be either solitary (with toys or other objects) or social (with animals and people). They can play with a multitude of toys ranging from strings, to small furry toys resembling what would be prey (e.g. mice), to plastic bags.\n\nObject play for animals (in this case, cats) is the use of inanimate objects by the animal to express play behaviour. In the case of pet domestic cats, humans normally provide them with purchased, human-made toys such as toy mice. When it comes to non-domestic, wild cats, they may use several objects in the wilderness as their toys including sticks, leaves, rocks, feathers, etc. Actions that cats may carry out as this play behaviour include throwing the toy object, chasing, biting, capturing, etc. as they might do with a real source of prey. Engaging in object play helps young cats to practice these skills that they need as they grow into adults.\n\nPlay in cats is a behaviour that is brought about during growth from the kitten stage onward. Some important aspects of this play behaviour for the development of kittens in to adult cats include motor development, social behaviour and cognitive development. There are different types of play that develop at different stages during the development and growth of a kitten. The first play behaviours observed in kittens include things like approaching, pawing and holding onto each other. Following this stage in their development, kittens begin to show an interest in inanimate objects and prey behaviour. This is the development of their nonsocial behaviour in which they become more independent and begin to practice predatory/hunting behaviour. Play behaviour in kittens is also important in providing them with physical exercise as they are growing, as well as providing a means of interacting with other members of their litter to keep strong social bonds among them. Social play is important between litter-mates since this is the main source of play for kittens in early life with little alternative to other means of play. Kittens are limited in room for exploring for other means of play, so engaging in this social play behaviour is important until they have access to other play objects such as toys. \n\nSince cats are meat-eating predators, nearly all cat games are predatory games.\n\nPrey are fearful of predators. Predators often encounter prey that attempt to escape predation. Prey that move towards the cat with confidence may be exhibiting an aggressive defensive posture. Cats often play with toys that behave more like fearful prey trying to escape than toys that mimic more confrontational prey.\n\nSuccess rate is important in play. A cat that catches its prey every time soon gets bored, and a cat that never gets it just loses interest. The ideal hunting success rate is around 1 in 3 to 1 in 6. Capturing prey at this rate generally maximises a cat's interest in the game.\n\nPlay is about predatory behaviour, and a highly excited cat can cause minor injuries in the excitement of the moment. With most cats, it is wise to keep playthings at least 20 cm (8\") away from fingers or eyes and avoid encouraging a cat to eat inedible toys. If playing with a human's bare hands, a cat will generally resist using its claws or biting too hard, but a cat that becomes extremely excited may accidentally inflict injuries to its human playmate in the form of light scratches or small puncture wounds from biting too hard. Cats' claws and mouths can contain bacteria that can lead to infection, so it is wise to clean and treat any wounds with an antiseptic solution and seek professional medical services if there is reason to believe that the wound has become infected.\n\nCatching and eating are two closely related but separate activities. Domestic cats often store caught food for eating later. Eating happens when the game is over, so incorporating food into hunting games tends to end the interest in play. Hidden treats helps engage cat's senses such as sense of smell and can be a form of play which enables them to utilize their searching skills. This idea of treats linked with play helps cats form the association that treats signify happy behaviour.\n\nThere are several different motor patterns associated with the play behaviour of cats and they have different roles in the social context. Pouncing is one of these motor patterns in which it is used to initiate play through physical contact. Chasing and horizontal leaping is an example of a motor pattern that may be used by a cat to end play. The movement of a cat's tail during play and the varying rates at which the cat may move its tail can even be a useful indicator of its level of playfulness. There are patterns of belly-up and stand-up actions that are engaged in by kittens in which seem to show that they prefer to engage in physical contact play in terms of their social role among other kittens.\n\nHunger has been shown to give an increase in intensity in the play behaviour of cats, and a decrease in fear which they show towards larger-sized toys. This effect that hunger has on play behaviour may be attributed to how experienced of a hunter the cat is. It is not expected that a cat who has a higher level of hunting experience would show this increased intensity of their play behaviour when hungry. Instead, they are more likely to show more predatory behaviour. In the case of cats with a lower level of hunting experience, they show this increased play behaviour since they are not able to engage in actual predatory activities and instead show predatory behaviours towards toys when hungry as an experienced hunter would show towards actual prey when hungry.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1909968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1909968", "title": "Cinema Novo", "text": "Cinema Novo\n\nCinema Novo is a genre and movement of film noted for its emphasis on social equality and intellectualism that rose to prominence in Brazil during the 1960s and 1970s. It means \"New Cinema\" in Portuguese, which is the official language of Brazil, the movement's \"home\". Cinema Novo formed in response to class and racial unrest both in Brazil and the United States. Influenced by Italian neorealism and French New Wave, films produced under the ideology of Cinema Novo opposed traditional Brazilian cinema, which consisted primarily of musicals, comedies and Hollywood-style epics. Glauber Rocha is widely regarded as Cinema Novo's most influential filmmaker. Today, the movement is often divided into three sequential phases that differ in tone, style and content.\n\nCinema Novo should not be confused with Novo Cinema (sometimes also referred to as \"Cinema Novo\"), a film movement that arose in Portugal between 1963 and 1974.\n\nIn the 1950s, Brazilian cinema was dominated by \"chanchada\" (musicals, often comedic and \"cheap\"), big-budget epics that imitated the style of Hollywood, and \"'serious' cinema\" that Cinema Novo filmmaker Carlos Diegues characterizes as \"sometimes cerebral and often ridiculously pretentious.\" This traditional cinema was supported by foreign producers, distributors and exhibitors. As the decade ended, young Brazilian filmmakers protested films they perceived as made in \"bad taste and ... sordid commercialism, ... a form of cultural prostitution\" that relied on the patronage of \"an illiterate and impoverished Brazil.\"\n\nCinema Novo became increasingly political. In the 1960s, Brazil was producing the most political cinema in South America. Brazil therefore became the natural “home of the Cinema Novo (New Cinema) movement”. Cinema Novo rose to prominence at the same time that progressive Brazilian Presidents Juscelino Kubitschek and later João Goulart took office and began to influence Brazilian popular culture. But it was not until 1959 or 1960 that 'Cinema Novo' emerged as a label for the movement. According to Randal Johnson and Robert Stam, Cinema Novo officially began in 1960, with the start of its first phase.\n\nIn 1961, the Popular Center of Culture, a subsidiary of the National Students' Union, released \"Cinco Vezes Favela\", a film serialized in five episodes that Johnson and Stam claim to be \"one of the first\" products of the Cinema Novo movement. The Popular Center of Culture (PCC) sought \"to establish a cultural and political link with the Brazilian masses by putting on plays in factories and working-class neighborhoods, producing films and records, and by participating in literacy programs.\" Johnson and Stam hold that \"many of the original members of Cinema Novo\" were also active members in the PCC who participated in the production of \"Cinco Vezes Favela\".\n\nBrazilian filmmakers modeled Cinema Novo after genres known for subversiveness: Italian neorealism and French New Wave. Johnson and Stam further claim that Cinema Novo has something in common \"with Soviet film of the twenties,\" which like Italian neorealism and French New Wave had \"a penchant for theorizing its own cinematic practice.\" Italian neorealist cinema often shot on location with nonprofessional actors and depicted working class citizens during the hard economic times following World War II. French New Wave drew heavily from Italian neorealism, as New Wave directors rejected classical cinema and embraced iconoclasm.\n\nSome proponents of Cinema Novo were \"scornful of the politics of the [French] New Wave\", viewing its tendency to stylistically copy Hollywood as elitist. But Cinema Novo filmmakers were largely attracted to French New Wave's use of auteur theory, which enabled directors to make low-budget films and develop personal fan bases.\n\nCinema Novo filmmaker Alex Viany describes the movement as having elements of participatory culture. According to Viany, while Cinema Novo was initially \"as fluid and undefined\" as its predecessor French New Wave, it required that filmmakers have a passion for cinema, a desire to use it to explain \"social and human problems,\" and a willingness to individualize their work.\n\nAuteur theory also greatly influenced Cinema Novo. Although its three phases were distinct, Cinema Novo encouraged directors to emphasize their personal politics and stylistic preferences. As Cinema Novo filmmaker Joaquim Pedro de Andrade explained to Viany in a 1966 interview:\n\nIn our films, the propositions, positions, and ideas are extremely varied, at times even contradictory or at least multiple. Above all they are increasingly free and unmasked. There exists a total freedom of expression. ... At first glance this would seem to indicate some internal incoherence within the Cinema Novo movement. But in reality I think it indicates a greater coherence: a more legitimate, truthful, and direct correspondence between the filmmaker--with his perplexities, doubts, and certainties--and the world in which he lives.\n\nClass struggle also informed Cinema Novo, whose strongest theme is the \"aesthetic of hunger\" developed by premiere Cinema Novo filmmaker Glauber Rocha in the first phase. Rocha wished to expose how different the standard of living was for rich South Americans and poor South Americans. In his 1965 essay \"The Esthetic of Hunger,\" Rocha stated that \"the hunger of South America is not simply an alarming symptom: it is the essence of our society. ... [Cinema Novo's] originality is [South Americans'] hunger[,] and our greatest misery is that this hunger is felt but not intellectually understood.\" On this note, Wheeler Winston Dixon and Gwendolyn Audrey Foster hold that \"[t]he Marxist implications of [Rocha's] cinema are hard to miss\".\n\nMost film historians divide Cinema Novo into three sequential phases that differ in theme, style and subject matter. Stam and Johnson identify \"a first phase going from 1960 to 1964,\" a second phase running \"from 1964 to 1968,\" and a third phase running \"from 1963 to 1972\" (though they also claim the final phase concludes at \"roughly\" \"the end of 1971\"). There is little disagreement among film critics about this time frame.\n\nFilmmaker Carlos Diegues claims that while lack of funds lowered the technical precision of Cinema Novo films, it also allowed directors, writers and producers to have an unusual amount of creative freedom. \"Because Cinema Novo is not a school, it has no established style,\" states Diegues. \"In Cinema Novo, expressive forms are necessarily personal and original without formal dogmas\". This directorial freedom, along with the changing social and political climate in Brazil, caused Cinema Novo to experience shifts in form and content in a short amount of time.\n\nFilms of the first phase represent the original motivation and goals of Cinema Novo. First-phase films were earnest in tone and rural in setting, dealing with social ills that affected the working class like starvation, violence, religious alienation and economic exploitation. They also addressed the \"fatalism and stoicism\" of the working class, which discouraged it from working to fix these problems. \"The films share a certain political optimism,\" write Johnson and Stam, \"a kind of faith that merely showing these problems would be a first step toward their solution.\"\n\nUnlike traditional Brazilian cinema that depicted beautiful professional actors in tropical paradises, first-phase Cinema Novo \"searched out the dark corners of Brazilian life--its \"favelas\" and its \"sertão\"--the places where Brazil's social contradictions appeared most dramatically.\" These topics were supported by aesthetics that \"were visually characterized by a documentary quality, often achieved by the use of a hand-held camera\" and were shot \"in black and white, using simple, stark scenery that vividly emphasized the harshness of the landscape\". Diegues contends that first-phase Cinema Novo did not focus on editing and shot-framing but rather on spreading a proletariat philosophy. \"Brazilian filmmakers (principally in Rio, Bahia, and São Paulo) have taken their cameras and gone out into the streets, the country, and the beaches in search of the Brazilian people, the peasant, the worker, the fisherman, the slum dweller.\"\n\nMost film historians agree that Glauber Rocha, \"one of the most well-known and prolific filmmakers to emerge in the late 1950s in Brazil\", was the most powerful advocate for Cinema Novo in its first phase. Dixon and Foster contend that Rocha helped initiate the movement because he wanted to make films that educated the public about social equality, art and intellectualism, which Brazilian cinema at the time did not do. Rocha summarized these goals by claiming his films used \"aesthetics of hunger\" to address class and racial unrest. In 1964, Rocha released \"Deus e o Diabo na Terra do Sol\" (\"Black God, White Devil\"), which he wrote and directed to “suggest that only violence will help those who are sorely oppressed\".\n\nWith Rocha at the helm during its first phase, Cinema Novo was praised by critics around the world.\n\nIn 1964, popular Democratic President João Goulart was removed from office by military coup, turning Brazil into a military-run autocracy under new President Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco. Brazilians consequently lost faith in the ideals of Cinema Novo, as the movement had promised to protect civilian rights yet had failed to uphold democracy. Cinema Novo filmmaker Joaquim Pedro de Andrade blamed fellow directors, whom he claimed had lost touch with Brazilians while appealing to critics: \"For a film to be a truly political instrument,\" de Andrade said, \"it must first communicate with its public\". Second-phase Cinema Novo thus sought to both deflect criticism and to address the \"anguish\" and \"perplexity\" that Brazilians felt after Goulart was ousted. It did this by producing films that were \"analyses of \"failure\"--of populism, of developmentalism, and of leftist intellectuals\" to protect Brazilian democracy.\n\nAt this time, filmmakers also started trying to make Cinema Novo more profitable. Stephanie Dennison and Lisa Shaw state that second-phase directors \"recognized the irony in making so-called 'popular' films, to be viewed only by university students and art-house aficionados. As a result, some \"auteurs\" began to move away from the so-called 'aesthetics of hunger' toward a filmmaking style and themes designed to attract the interest of the cinema-going public at large.\" As a result, the first Cinema Novo film to be shot in color and to depict middle-class protagonists was released during this time: Leon Hirzshman's \"Garota de Ipanema\" (\"Girl from Ipanema,\" 1968).\n\nHans Proppe and Susan Tarr characterize Cinema Novo's third phase as \"a mixed bag of social and political themes against a backdrop of characters, images and contexts not unlike the richness and floridness of the Brazilian jungle\". Third-phase Cinema Novo has also been called \"the cannibal-tropicalist phase\" or simply the \"tropicalist\" phase.\n\nTropicalism was a movement that focused on kitsch, bad taste and gaudy colors. Film historians refer to cannibalism both literally and metaphorically. Both types of cannibalism are visible in \"Como Era Gostoso o Meu Frances\" (\"How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman,\" 1971), in which the protagonist is abducted and eaten by literal cannibals at the same time it is \"suggested that the Indians (i.e., Brazil) should metaphorically cannibalize their foreign enemies, appropriating their force without being dominated by them.\" Rocha believed cannibalism represented the violence that was necessary to enact social change and depict it onscreen: \"From Cinema Novo it should be learned that an aesthetic of violence, before being primitive, is revolutionary. It is the initial moment when the colonizer becomes aware of the colonized. Only when confronted with violence does the colonizer understand, through horror, the strength of the culture he exploits.\"\n\nWith Brazil modernizing in the global economy, third-phase Cinema Novo also became more polished and professional, producing \"films in which the rich cultural texture of Brazil has been pushed to the limit and exploited for its own aesthetic ends rather than for its appropriateness as political metaphor.\" Brazilian consumers and filmmakers began to feel that Cinema Novo was contradicting the ideals of its first phase. This perception led to the birth of Novo Cinema Novo, also called \"Udigrudi\" cinema, which used 'dirty screen' and 'garbage' aesthetics to return Cinema Novo to its original focus on marginalized characters and social problems.\n\nBut third-phase Cinema Novo also had supporters. Cinema Novo filmmaker Joaquim Pedro de Andrade, who was active during the first phase and produced one of the premiere films of the third phase, \"Macunaíma\", was pleased Cinema Novo had made itself more relatable to Brazilian citizens, despite accusations it was selling out to do so. Referencing Leon Hirszman's \"Garota de Ipanema\", de Andrade praised Hirszman for using \"a popular stereotype to establish contact with the masses, while at the same time ... demystif[ying] that very stereotype\".\n\nBurnes St. Patrick Hollyman, son of famed American photographer Thomas Hollyman, states that \"by 1970, many of the cinema novo films had won numerous awards at international festivals\". In 1970 Rocha published a manifesto on the progress of Cinema Novo, in which he said he was pleased that Cinema Novo \"had gained critical acceptance as part of world cinema\" and had become \"a nationalist cinema that accurately reflected the artistic and ideological concerns of the Brazilian people\" (Hollyman). But Rocha also warned filmmakers and consumers that being too complacent in the achievements of Cinema Novo would return Brazil to its pre-Cinema Novo state:\n\nThe movement is bigger than any one of us. But the young should know that they cannot be irresponsible about the present and the future because today's anarchy can be tomorrow's slavery. Before long, imperialism will start to exploit the newly created films. If the Brazilian cinema is the palm tree of Tropicalism, it is important that the people who have lived through the drought are on guard to make sure that Brazilian cinema doesn't become underdeveloped.\n\nRocha's fears were realized. In 1977, filmmaker Carlos Diegues said that \"one can only talk about Cinema Novo in nostalgic or figurative terms because Cinema Novo as a group no longer exists, above all because it has been diluted into Brazilian cinema.\" Toward the end of Cinema Novo, the Brazilian government created film company Embrafilme to encourage production of Brazilian cinema; but Embrafilme mostly produced films that ignored the Cinema Novo ideology. Aristides Gazetas claims that Third Cinema now carries on the Cinema Novo tradition.\n\nIn 1969, the Brazilian government instituted Embrafilme, a company designed to produce and distribute Brazilian cinema. Embrafilme produced movies of various genres, including fantasies and big-budget epics. At the time, Cinema Novo filmmaker Carlos Diegues said he supported Embrafilme because it was \"the only enterprise with sufficient economic and political power to confront the devastating voracity of the multinational corporations in Brazil.\" Moreover, Diegues held that while Cinema Novo \"is not identified with Embrafilme\", \"[Embrafilme's] existence ... is in reality a project of Cinema Novo.\"\n\nWhen Embrafilme was dismantled in 1990 by President Fernando Collor de Mello, \"the consequences\" for the Brazilian film industry \"were immediate and grim.\" Lacking investors, many Brazilian directors co-produced English films. This caused English cinema to overrun the Brazilian market, which went from producing 74 films in 1989 to producing nine films in 1993. Brazilian President Itamar Franco ended the crisis by implementing the Brazilian Cinema Rescue Award, which funded 90 projects between 1993 and 1994. The award \"opened new doors to a young generation of new film-makers (and a few of the veterans) who were confident that, as the title of a film by Cinema Novo veteran director Carlos Diegues prophetically announced, better days would come (\"Melhores Dias Virao\"/\"Better Days Will Come\", 1989).\"\n\nAccording to Aristides Gazetas, Cinema Novo is the first example of an influential genre called Third Cinema. Like Cinema Novo, Third Cinema draws on Italian neorealism and French New Wave. Gazetas claims that Cinema Novo can be characterized as early Third Cinema because Glauber Rocha \"adopted Third Cinema techniques to bring awareness of the social and political realities in his country through cinema\". After fading with Cinema Novo, Third Cinema was revived in 1986 when English film companies looked to create a genre that \"focused upon non Anglo-American cinematic practices\" and \"avoided both the sentimental leftist cultural theory emanating from the UK and the cultural and educational practices in line with corporate cultures and market consumerism that related to variants of postmodernism.\"\n\nIn 1965, Glauber Rocha claimed that \"Cinema Novo is a phenomenon of new peoples everywhere and not a privilege of Brazil.\" Appropriately, Third Cinema has affected film culture throughout the world. In Italy, Gillo Pontecorvo directed \"Battaglia di Algeri\" (\"The Battle of Algiers,\" 1966), which depicted native African muslims as brave terrorists fighting French colonialists in Algeria. Cuban filmmaker Tomas Gutierrez Alea, co-founder of the ground-breaking Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos, used Third Cinema to \"reconstitut[e] an historical past for Cubans.\" According to Stuart Hall, Third Cinema also impacted black peoples in the Caribbean by giving them two identities: one in which they are unified across a diaspora, and another that highlights \"what black people have become as a result of white rule and colonization.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The think tank consisted of a variety of volunteer Mattel employees from inside and outside of the product development department. The goal set for the think tank was to create a toy that would successfully engage girls in construction play.\n\nOver a series of weeks the think tank divided into a collection of teams and individuals who developed competing concepts for a series of focus group testing and selection by girls and parents. A concept named \"Ello\" created by one of the teams and that included former Barbie Packaging Creative Director Richard Manville received enthusiastic praise from both girls and parents alike.\n\nDescribed as a \"creation system\" the Ello concept (targeted primarily to girls ages 5 to 14) incorporated some traditional elements of craft (beading and graphic customization), shapes and panels in unique color palettes, a variety of themes, and a flexible intuitive building process.

She is known for finishing third place at Miss America 2008, and for competing on the reality competition show \"Survivor\", following her stint as Miss Washington.\n\nUmemoto grew up in Wapato, Washington, with her three younger sisters and her parents, Gary and Luana. She attended Wapato High School, where played soccer and tennis, and performed as a cheerleader. She graduated in 2001. Later, she enrolled at Pacific Lutheran University, double-majoring in psychology and political science.\n\nUmemoto is of German, Japanese, Hispanic, and Native American origin. She is an enrolled member of the Yakama tribe.\n\nWhile in college, one of Umemoto's friends suggested that she enter a beauty pageant. Her first such pageant, Miss Pierce County (WA), took place in 2006. She won, and went on to finish as first runner-up at Miss Washington that year. One year later, as Miss Seattle, she won the Miss Washington crown and the right to represent the state at Miss America 2008. Her platform at Miss America was \"Embracing Diversity, Empowering Women.\" For the talent competition, she sang \"Angels\" by British singer/songwriter Robbie Williams.\n\nOn the night of the pageant telecast, Umemoto was crowned second runner-up, behind first runner-up Nicole Rash of Indiana and Miss America 2008 Kirsten Haglund of Michigan. Umemoto's finish was tied for the highest ever by a Miss Washington delegate. For her efforts, she earned a USD $20,000 scholarship, plus an additional $10,000 USD for placing in the Top Three of the pre-pageant reality show \"\".\n\nIn the Spring 2008, Umemoto revealed that she had been the victim of domestic violence. Her boyfriend had assaulted her at her home in Tacoma, shortly after the Miss America pageant took place. She immediately reported the incident to Pierce County Sheriff's Department, and the now ex-boyfriend went on the plead guilty to a domestic violence charge. He was sentenced to community service.\n\nThe week before she was to crown her successor as Miss Washington, Umemoto held a press conference to address a controversy over suggestive photos of her that had been leaked and published by TMZ. At the press gathering, she apologized for photos in which she was seen playing college drinking games and making obscene hand gestures while wearing her pageant crown. She stated that those photos were taken in private and had been stolen from her in violation of her trust. Ultimately, pageant officials decided not to discipline her for the photos.\n\nFollowing her stint as Miss Washington, Umemoto moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, where she starting working as the manager of a dance team.\n\nIn 2011, Umemoto was one of 18 people selected for the cast of \"\", the series' 23rd season overall. At the start of the game, she was placed on the Savaii tribe, the most notable member of which was Ozzy Lusth, a two-time returning player and one of two returnees that season (the other being Benjamin \"Coach\" Wade of the opposing tribe, Upolu). Umemoto would later form a tight bond with Lusth, becoming part of his alliance along with Jim Rice, Keith Tollefson, and Whitney Duncan. By Episode Four, however, Rice became leery of Umemoto and Lusth's relationship, and along with John Cochran, hatched a plan to eliminate her. But Savaii would go on to win the next immunity challenge on Day 11, meaning that she would remain safe that night. On Day 14, though, Savaii lost the immunity challenge, and both Rice and Cochran convinced Dawn Meehan to join them in blindsiding Umemoto.\n\nAt that night's Tribal Council, Umemoto was indeed voted out, but not immediately eliminated. As this was a Redemption Island season, she was sent to Redemption Island to join Christine Shields-Markoski, who had been voted out nine days earlier and had won the first three elimination duels of the season. For the next such duel, Umemoto and Shields-Markoski battled each other in a shuffleboard-style game. Each combatant started out with four pucks of her own on the board, and the object was to slide neutral pucks to the other side in an attempt to become the first to knock all of the opponent's pucks off the board. Shields-Markoski won the duel, her fourth in a row, and Umemoto became the fourth person eliminated from the game, finishing 15th place overall.\n\n"}

{"id": "1122906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1122906", "title": "Expressive therapies", "text": "Expressive therapies\n\nThe expressive psychotherapies are the use of the creative arts as a form of therapy, including the distinct disciplines expressive arts therapy and the creative arts therapies (art therapy, dance/movement therapy, drama therapy, music therapy, poetry therapy, and psychodrama). Unlike traditional art expression, the process of creation is emphasized rather than the final product. The expressive therapies are based on the assumption that people can heal through the various forms of creative expression. Expressive therapists share the belief that through creative expression and the tapping of the imagination, people can examine their body, feelings, emotions, and thought process.\n\nExpressive arts therapy is the practice of using imagery, storytelling, dance, music, drama, poetry, movement, horticulture, dreamwork, and visual arts together, in an integrated way, to foster human growth, development, and healing. Expressive arts therapy is its own distinct therapeutic discipline, an inter-modal discipline where the therapist and client move freely between drawing, dancing, music, drama, and poetry.\n\nAccording to the National Organization for Arts in Health (NOAH), what distinguishes the six \"creative arts therapies\" — art, dance/movement, drama, music and poetry therapy as well as psychodrama—from \"expressive arts therapy\" is that expressive arts therapy interventions are designed to include more than one of the \"expressive\" art forms (art, dance, drama, music, poetry), whereas creative arts therapists, such as art, dance/movement, drama, music, poetry and psychodrama therapists, are often intensively trained and educated to use only one modality in their practice. But NOAH also acknowledged that the terms \"are often used interchangeably in the field\", and that in any case all such professionals should collaborate closely.\n\nThe International Association of Expressive Arts Therapy (IAEAT) is the responsible organization handling the credentialing of expressive arts therapists.\n\nThe National Coaltion of Creative Arts Therapies Association (NCCATA) connects all six modalities of the creative arts therapies. However, each modality of the creative arts therapies has its own national association that regulates professional credentials, establishes educational standards and hosts annual conferences for the purpose of exchanging new ideas and research.\n\nEach national association of the different modalities of expressive therapies sets its own educational standards. In the United States, there are a fair number of colleges that offer approved programs in compliance with the national associations' credentialing requirements.\n\nThere are 37 universities for music therapy, 34 universities for art therapy, seven universities for dance/movement therapy, and five universities for drama therapy, as well as 5 universities for expressive arts therapy, that have approved master's degree programs in the United States. In addition, the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) has 75 undergraduate music therapy programs approved. Once finished with an academic degree, potential therapists have to apply for credentialing at the responsible national association.\n\nThere are six creative arts therapy modalities, recognized by the NCCATA, including art therapy, dance therapy, drama therapy, music therapy, poetry therapy and psychodrama.\n\nArt therapy combines psychotherapy and visual art. The creative process as well as the created art piece serves as a foundation for self-exploration, understanding, acceptance and eventually healing and personal growth. The creative act in therapy therefore can be seen as a means of re-experiencing inner conflict connected to resolution.\n\nLike other creative arts therapy modalities, dance/movement therapy is based on the assumption that \"mind, body and spirit are inseparable and interconnected\" (ADTA). Movement is the primary tool of intervention in a therapy session, but dance/movement therapy also uses the art of play in therapy. Like other creative art therapies it uses primarily nonverbal communication.\n\nDrama therapy refers to the combination of the two disciplines drama/theatre and psychotherapy. Drama Therapy, as a hybrid of both disciplines, uses theater techniques to treat individuals with mental health, cognitive, and developmental disorders. Through the art of play and pretend, patients gain perspective in therapy to their life experiences, which in the field is referred to as \"aesthetic distance\".\n\nMusic therapy is the use of music and music-making in a psychotherapeutic relationship, making it a musical therapeutic relationship. At its core, music therapy uses music as a symbolic representation and expression of the psychological world of the individual. Music therapy helps patients \"communicate, process difficult experiences, and improve motor or cognitive functioning\" (Jenni Rook, MT-BC, LCPC, 2016).\n\nPoetry therapy (also referred to as bibliotherapy) stands out from other creative arts therapies, which are all based on the assumption of the existence of a language that functions without words. Poetry therapy, however, is the use of the written word to bring healing and personal growth.\n\nPsychodrama is a distinct form of psychotherapy developed by Jacob L. Moreno in the early 20th century. Moreno, a trained psychoanalyst himself, had the goal of creating a more effective, action-based form of psychoanalysis as developed by Sigmund Freud and C.G. Jung. He developed a clear three phase structure (warm up, action, sharing) to his therapy as well as multiple intervention-methods that are still used by psychodrama therapists today.\n\nAlthough related, psychodrama and drama therapy describe different modalities within the field of creative arts therapies. Whereas psychodrama uses real-life experience of the patients in therapy to \"practice new and more effective roles and behaviors\" (ASGPP), drama therapy lets the patients explore more fictional stories, such as improvised scenes, myths or fairy tales.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52606202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52606202", "title": "Faking (Western classical music)", "text": "Faking (Western classical music)\n\nIn instrumental music performances in Western classical music, \"faking\" is the process by which a musician gives the \"...impression of playing every note as written\" in the printed music part, typically for a very challenging passage that is very high in pitch and/or very rapid, while not actually playing all of the notes in the part. Faking may be done by an orchestra musician, a concerto soloist or a chamber musician; however, faking tends to be more associated with orchestra playing, because the presence of such a large music ensemble (as many as 100 musicians) makes it easier for musicians who \"fake\" to do so without being detected. A concerto soloist or chamber musician who faked passages would be much easier for audience members and other musicians to detect. Orchestra musicians at every level, from amateur orchestras and youth orchestras to professional orchestra players will occasionally \"fake\" a hard passage.\nFaking is considered controversial in orchestral playing; \"The Strad\" magazine calls it one of the \"great unmentionable [topics] of orchestral playing\". A professional cellist states that all orchestral musicians, even those in the top orchestras, occasionally \"fake\" certain passages. Professional players who were interviewed were of a consensus that faking because a part is not written well for the instrument may be acceptable, but faking \"just because you haven't practised\" the music is not acceptable.\n\nA musician from the Canadian Music Centre stated that \"...when I hear someone [a musician] say \"I can just fake that\" [music] is akin to nails on a chalkboard.\" The CMC musician states that as a \"...performer I feel obligated to make sure I can play the music as well as I can. If that means I have to woodshed [(practice) a] lick up until the day of the concert that is what I will do, I can't personally accept \"faking\" it as an answer for any kind of music.\"\n\nOne reason that musicians \"fake\" is because there are not enough rehearsals or time to learn the pieces.Another factor is the extreme challenges in contemporary pieces; professionals interviewed by the magazine said \"faking\" was \"...necessary in anything from ten to almost ninety per cent of some modern works. Youth orchestra members and players in amateur or community orchestras may fake because the parts in professional orchestral repertoire are beyond their technical level. Gigging musicians playing in \"one-off\" pickup groups and local pit orchestras may fake because they do not have time to practice or prepare the music.\n\nIn jazz, the term \"fake\" does not have the same meaning as in Classical music, and as well, it does not carry negative connotations. In jazz, when a jazz quartet \"fakes\" accompaniment parts to a song with a singer, this is a synonym for improvising their backup parts. Improvising backup lines (chord voicings for piano/guitar, basslines for bass, and drum parts for drum set) is an essential skill for jazz musicians. The use of the term \"fake\" in the jazz scene is illustrated by the expression \"fake book\", a collection of lead sheets and chord progressions for jazz standards (commonly-played jazz tunes). The reason the book is called a \"fake book\" is because trained jazz performers are able to improvise accompaniment parts and solos from the chord charts contained therein.\n\nThere is some overlap between faking and miming in instrumental performance. The distinction is that with miming, the instrumentalists pretend to play while a pre-recorded backing track sounds over the PA system or, for a broadcast performance, on the audience's TV or radio; with faking, there is no backing track or use of technology. As well, with faking, the performer often plays some portion of the notated music. For example, with a fast scale run, an orchestral musician who is faking may play the first note and the last note. In contrast, a musician who is miming while the recording is playing over speakers does not need to make any sounds at all. She only needs to move her body, arms and fingers to give the appearance of playing. Indeed, in some miming contexts, the instrumentalists are instructed not to make any sounds at all, as these might be picked up by live vocal mics on the stage.\n\nWhile miming in instrumental performance is most often associated with popular music, due to the widespread use of lip-synching and miming instrumental playing on TV shows such as \"Top of the Pops\" (while the recording plays on the viewer's TV speakers), there are examples where producers have hired an orchestra or chamber musicians to appear on a stage and pretend to play, while the spectators (if in a live venue) or viewers (if a broadcast event) hear a previously recorded tape of that orchestra/ensemble (or a different orchestra or ensemble) playing.\n\n"}

The fourth installment in the \"Fatal Frame\" series and the first on a Nintendo console, it was released in Japan on July 31, 2008. Despite a European release being announced, the game has never been released outside Japan. A fan translation was released in 2010.\n\nThe story, set on the fictional Rougetsu Island, focuses on Ruka Minazuki, one of a group of girls who was held captive on the island for unknown reasons. Years after their rescue, still suffering from amnesia, Ruka and the two surviving girls return to the island to seek out the truth. The game's title stems from a ritual mask key to the story. The gameplay, as with previous entries in the series, revolves around the main character exploring environments and tackling hostile ghosts using the Camera Obscura.\n\nThe idea for \"Mask of the Lunar Eclipse\" came to series co-creator Keisuke Kikuchi when he first saw the Wii hardware. Kikuchi and series co-creator Makoto Shibata returned as respective producer and director, while Grasshopper Manufacture's Goichi Suda acted as co-director, co-writer and designer. The gameplay concept was making the player literally feel the fear evoked in the game. The addition of further developers to the project enabled the team to reconsider the standard formula, although it proved to be a chaotic experience. As with previous games, the theme songs were sung by Tsuki Amano. When released, it became the best-selling entry in the series to that date, and received mixed to positive from Japanese and Western critics.\n\n\"Zero: Tsukihami no Kamen\", commonly referred to in the West as \"Mask of the Lunar Eclipse\", has players taking control of four different character navigating a variety of different environments, including traditional Japanese houses and a Meiji-era sanatorium-turned-hotel. Environments are navigated from a third-person perspective using the Wii Nunchuk. During exploration, the characters are regularly attacked by hostile spirits, who take away the characters' health through touch.\n\nThe two central characters can fight off and defeat spirits using the series' recurring Camera Obscura, a camera that captures spirits. Shots taken by the Camera Obscura deal varying amounts of damage based on how close the ghost is, the angle of the shot, and the film used. These factors are taken together to determine how many points the player is awarded for a shot. The most damaging type of shot is the \"Fatal Frame\", which is achieved if a shot is taken when the ghost is attacking. Points are used as the in-game currency, which can be used at save points to purchase items such as medicine and other items. Blue gems scattered around the environment can be used to upgrade the Camera Obscura, with some upgrades speeding reload time or enabling shots to deal more damage. Types of film range from an unlimited low-quality film that deals little damage to rarer and more powerful film types.\n\nIn addition to the Camera Obscura, the character can use a flashlight to explore their surroundings, and one character has access to a special Spirit Flashlight, which uses moonlight to pacify spirits. The Camera Obscura and flashlights are controlled with the Wii Remote. Should a ghost attack, gestures with the Wii Remote can shake them off. The \"New Game+\" mode unlocks additional costumes and further items and upgrades, many of them dependent on how much the player has scored during the initial playthrough. On higher difficulties, the number of items available is reduced.\n\nIn 1970, ten years prior to the start of the game, suspected serial killer Yō Haibara kidnapped five girls from their rooms in a sanatorium on Rougetsu, an island south of Honshu. The girls were rescued from a cavern beneath the sanatorium by detective Chōshirō Kirishima, who had been pursuing Haibara, but they had all lost their memories. Two years later, a catastrophe strikes Rougetsu Island which kills off the inhabitants. Eight years later, in the present, two of the rescued girls have died in mysterious circumstances and two of the survivors, Misaki Asō and Madoka Tsukimori, return to discover the truth about their pasts. Despite being warned by her mother not to return to the island, fellow survivor Ruka Minazuki goes there to find Misaki and Madoka. Shortly before Ruka's arrival, Madoka is killed by hostile spirits. Chōshirō, the detective who rescued them, also returns to the island to both find Ruka and continue his pursuit of Haibara. During her exploration, Ruka learns that she and Misaki are suffering from a malady known as the Hidden Moon Disease, which affects their memories and identity and is spread by touch and vision. Each character also collects pieces of a mask used in a local ritual dance to ease the passing of souls into the afterlife. During the course of the story, it is revealed that Misaki arranged their return to the island so their illness might be cured, and that Chōshirō himself died ten years before, and is now helping the girls guided by the benevolent spirit of Ruka's mother Sayaka.\n\nIt is gradually revealed that Ruka's father Souya had become obsessed with helping complete a ritual dance that would purify the islanders of the Hidden Moon Disease, which required the construction of a special mask for the dancer. Ruka herself became infected, and was treated at the sanatorium along with the other girls and the dancer, Haibara's sister Sakuya. The ritual was a catastrophic failure, with Sakuya reaching the final stage of the Hidden Moon Disease and falling into a coma, while the other girls collapsed and had their memories wiped. Two years after Ruka and Sayaka left the island, Sakuya woke and spread the Hidden Moon Disease across the island, killing all the inhabitants including Souya. To lay her to rest, the ritual must be completed, and for that her mask must be restored. Ruka comes into possession of all the mask fragments, which reform into the complete mask. Confronting Sakuya atop the island's lighthouse, she manages to pacify her with a sacred tune communicated to her by Sayaka, then Chōshirō puts the mask on Sakuya, completing the ritual and allowing all the island's spirits to pass into the afterlife. Depending on the game's difficulty setting, Misaki's fate is either left unknown, or her illness is cured after she is saved by Madoka's spirit and she leaves the island with Ruka.\n\n\"Mask of the Lunar Eclipse\" was co-developed by Koei Tecmo, Grasshopper Manufacture and Nintendo Software Planning & Development. Koei Tecmo was in charge of the gameplay and atmosphere, Grasshopper Manufacture were put in charge of character motion and other unspecified aspects of development, while Nintendo managed general production. Makoto Shibata and Keisuke Kikuchi, series creators and respective director and producer of the previous games in the series, returned to their respective posts. In addition, Grasshopper Manufacture's Goichi Suda acted as a co-director, co-writer and designer. Suda was initially reluctant to work on the project due to his intense dislike for ghosts and horror games. According to a later interview with Kikuchi, he was first inspired when he saw the potential in the Wii hardware, and was the first to propose the project to Nintendo. The main development goal for \"Mask of the Lunar Eclipse\" was \"feeling fear with [the player's] body\", with gameplay functions closely tied into the Wii hardware. Among these were feeding sounds through the Wii remote's speaker and creating effects using the rumble function. An adjustment they made was to the camera perspective: while it had been placed at a distance in previous games, it was shifted to an over-the-shoulder third-person view so the control of the torch was more realistic. This raised concerns as to the pace of the character's movement. Taking into account similar criticisms from fans of earlier games, the characters' speed was increased. This aspect was undergoing revision until quite late into development.\n\nWhen designing the game's main setting, the team moved away from the traditional enclosed Japanese mansions from previous games in favor of somewhere that blended Eastern and Western architectural tastes to create different gameplay opportunities, described in-game as a Meiji-era hotel. Traditional mansion settings were also included, with more locations being present than in previous games. The color yellow was chosen as the game's image color, while the key words used to describe the plot were \"memory\", \"moon\" and \"mask\". The subtitle refers to the mask that is key to the Kagura Dance Ritual. The mask in turn tied into story themes of the phases of the moon, the nature of memory, and music. During development, Shibata and Kikuchi felt that Grasshopper and Nintendo's involvement helped them reevaluate the series formula and try out new things. After development, Kikuchi said that the three companies' varying ideas on the project made the development \"a complete and utter mess\", though it ultimately worked out well. The characters were designed by Takeyasu Sawaki, who had previously worked in that capacity on \"Ōkami\" and \"\". The music was composed by Masafumi Takada and Etsuko Ichikawa. As with the previous two games, \"Mask of the Lunar Eclipse\" features songs by Japanese singer Tsuki Amano: the theme song \"Zero Tuning\", and the ending theme \"Noise\".\n\n\"Mask of the Lunar Eclipse\" was first revealed in January 2008 at a Tecmo press conference. It was the first series title to be developed and released for a Nintendo console. It was released on July 31, 2008. Its release was timed to coincide with a traditional time in Japan for people to tell each other ghost stories. Upon release, the game featured several bugs affecting player progress through the game, as revealed in a message to fans from Nintendo. While no North American release was planned, a European release was in the works and was briefly outed by a French gaming magazine. After the leak, Nintendo stated that a European release had been planned, but since then the localization had been cancelled. In addition to Nintendo, no other third-party publisher would publish the game overseas, leaving \"Mask of the Lunar Eclipse\" as a Japan-exclusive title.\n\nAfter Nintendo's announcement, a three-person team decided to create a fan translation of the game. The development process was compared by them to \"a Frankenstein's monster\", referring to how they needed to assess the data, construct a development schedule for the translation patch, going through theories about file structure, then creating a tool to access the game's data files. The modification program was then tested on \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" by a dedicated tester, then sent back for refinement. They worked hard to preserve the atmosphere of the original game, along with attempting to make the translation as true as possible without being overly verbose. To help translate the text, they posted the script in segments on internet forums, then later restricted access to the work due to quality concerns. During this time, they found several competent translators who were able to do the final 20% of script translation. It took several months for the entire process of extracting text, translation, then patching in the translated text to be completed. The patch ended up being quite large as the game designers had split the game into hundreds of different data archives and suitable accommodations and adjustments needed to be made for this. The fan translation was released on January 19, 2010. The patch was designed to work on any Wii device, bypassing the console's region locking, and included a newly-made costume for the main character. While receiving no official localized title, it has commonly been dubbed \"\"Fatal Frame / Project Zero IV\" or \"Fatal Frame / Project Zero: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse\"\" by journalists.\n\nDuring its debut, \"Mask of the Lunar Eclipse\" sold approximately 30,000 units, making one of the weaker debuts of the series. As of the end of December 2008, the game had sold nearly 75,000 units. While these were low sales compared to other Wii titles, it made \"Mask of the Lunar Eclipse\" the best-selling title in the series to that date.\n\nThe reviewers for \"Famitsu\" were united in their opinion that, while not a revolutionary title within the series, it was a high-quality game. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed regularly noted its similarity to previous entries in the series, praising the atmosphere and gameplay, while criticizing the control scheme and its negative effect on combat and navigation. In a preview of the game, Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku praised the game's multiple storylines and settings, but was mixed about its familiar gameplay and again criticized the controls. In closing, he generally cited it as a good entry in the series. Matthew Blundon of Nintendo Life, echoing the criticism of the controls, said that it would please hardcore horror game players. Albert Lichi of Cubed3 again faulted the control set up. In most other respects he was highly positive, praising the story, combat and graphics, calling it a \"labor of love\" on the part of the development team. In its import review, \"Edge Magazine\" generally enjoyed the unsettling atmosphere that the developers had succeeded in creating by using the dark settings and close-set camera angle. The reviewer also defended the often-criticized control scheme, saying that it added to the feeling of fear. In closing, the reviewer said that the subtlety of the game showed the flaws in other horror franchises such as \"Silent Hill\".\n"}

This includes the magazine version (which does not include any DVDs and is thus cheaper), a \"normal\" edition, which includes one DVD, and a XL Version, which contains 2 DVDs. The magazine for subscribers has less advertisement and shows a larger front-page picture. Until mid-2005 a CD-only version was also available, but it was decided that DVD-readers in Computers had become widespread enough, and so the CD-version was deemed unnecessary. Instead the XL version appeared for the first time.\n\n\"Gamestar\" was founded by Charles Glimm, Jörg Langer und Toni Schwaiger with the IDG Entertainment Media GmbH as publisher in 1997, with Jörg Langer as editor-in-chief.\n\nThe new magazine soon gained a lot of popularity. By the fourth quarter of 1999 it sold about 333,000 issues per month, in 2000 it overtook competitor PC Games as the largest German language videogames magazine in Europe.\n\nIDG also started \"GameStar\" sister magazines in Italy, Poland, Hungary and the United States. The US version was, quite differently from the rest, positioned as a magazine for adults, about PC and console games, similar to inCite. However they all folded after a few months due to disappointing sales. The only long term launch was achieved in Hungary. In 2005, \"GameStar\" spawned a sister magazine called \"/GameStar/dev\" which is targeted at European Game Developers. \"GameStar\" also has a sister magazine named \"GamePro\", which focuses on console games. Incidentally its headquarters are right next-door to the \"GameStar\" office.\n\nIn April 2015 \"GameStar\" and its sister magazine \"GamePro\" were sold by IDG to the French publisher Webedia.\n\nJörg Langer was succeeded by Gunnar Lott as editor-in-chief, followed by Michael Trier on 1 December 2007. As of June 2016, editor-in-Chief is Heiko Klinge.\n\n\"GameStar\" also held a popular known E-Sports-League, the \"GameStar Clanliga\", featuring games such a \"Warcraft III\", \"Counter-Strike\" as well as \"\".\n\nAfter it launched, \"GameStar\" was able to steadily gain in popularity. By the fourth quarter of 1999 it sold about 331.535 issues per month and in 2000 it overtook its competitor \"PC Games\" as the largest German language PC games magazine in Europe. Since then, \"GameStar\" kept the spot as the bests sold German language PC-gaming focused magazine in Europe.\n\nLike the whole print market, \"GameStar\" was affected by diminishing sales. In 2008 the average monthly circulation was 250,000 copies, but by January 2015 sold issues per month have dropped to 63,189. Despite the drop, \"GameStar\" remains the highest selling German language PC-gaming focused magazine in Europe.\n\n\"GameStar\" hosts a large PC gaming related portal in the internet. Like the magazine, the portal is centered on PC gaming and publishes news, reviews and tests for PC games and PC gaming related topics. \"GameStar.de\" is the largest PC gaming web portal in the German speaking internet and one of the largest web portals in the entirety of the German speaking internet. As of February 2016, \"Gamestar.de\" had 2.41 million unique visitors per month.\n\nOn YouTube, \"GameStar\" has its own channel with about 751,000 abonnements. During its history, \"Gamestar\" and IDG also hosted several spin-off YouTube channels, such as \"High5\" with temporary success. As off 2016, those have been already closed however.\n\n\"Gamestar.de\" also hosts a large internet forum, the GSPB (GameStar Pinboard).

He was sentenced instead to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nThe film was announced in 2014. Funds for its production were raised via crowdfunding, in which $2.4 million was raised for the creation of the film. The film was written by Irish filmmakers Ann McElhinney and Phelim McAleer and directed by Nick Searcy. Andrew Klavan was the screenwriter. It stars Earl Billings and Dean Cain. After difficulties finding a distributor willing to carry the film and a lawsuit by a judge who objected to his portrayal in the film, the producers signed a distribution deal with GVN Releasing. It was released in approximately 650 theaters across the United States on October 12, 2018.\n\nThe film focuses on the police investigation and trial of Kermit Gosnell. The film draws from the book \"Gosnell: The Untold Story of America's Most Prolific Serial Killer\".\n\n\nThe film was announced in 2014, less than a year after Gosnell was tried and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The filmmakers sought to raise funds for the production of the film through crowdfunding, but encountered resistance from Kickstarter, which the filmmakers said censored the project from their website. According to email exchanges released by McAleer, Kickstarter requested that the phrases \"'1000s of babies stabbed to death\" and '1000s of babies murdered'...be removed or modified to comply with the spirit of our Community Guidelines.\" Kickstarter's CEO denied that they censored the project and said the filmmakers blew an editorial exchange out of proportion.\n\nThe filmmakers switched to Indiegogo and launched their crowdfunding effort on March 28, 2014, with a goal of $2.1 million, which was reached less than two weeks later on April 9, 2014. It quickly became the highest-funded film on Indiegogo, and is currently one of the highest-funded crowdfunding projects of all time.\n\nThe film was originally intended to be a made for TV movie, but the filmmakers later decided to make it into a feature film. John Sullivan was announced as the executive producer of the film in December 2014. Nick Searcy was announced as the director of the film in March 2015. Searcy said in a statement, \"I am both excited and humbled by the opportunity to have a part in bringing this important American story to the screen. It is a story that many in Hollywood were unwilling to tell, and I am grateful to Ann, Phelim and Magdalena for having the courage to tell it.\" He also said, \"There are three aspects to this story that are fascinating. What happened; why it was allowed to happen; and why no one wanted to talk about it after it happened.\" Searcy later wrote in a September 2018 op-ed in National Review that he knew taking on a controversial project would cause him to be shunned by some in Hollywood but agreed to direct after reading the script. Searcy says he sought to make a film that \"would inform and benefit people on both sides of this issue, no matter how passionate\" and that would treat the politics of the case \"objectively in an honest and compelling film.\"\n\nEarl Billings was cast to play Kermit Gosnell, and Dean Cain was cast as Detective James Wood, one of the detectives who investigated Gosnell.\n\nMusician John Ondrasik, also known by his stage name Five for Fighting, recorded a song entitled \"The Song of Innocents\" for the end credits of the film.\n\nFilming was completed in October 2015, and release was expected in 2016, but a distribution deal was not secured until June 2018.\n\nThe film faced additional delays when, days before a distribution was set to be announced in June 2017, the Philadelphia judge who presided over Gosnell's trial, Jeffrey Minehart, filed a defamation lawsuit against the filmmakers for $50,000, stating the book and film portrayed Minehart \"'as a villain in their story of the righteous versus the wicked' when in fact he's a \"former prosecutor with an impeccable reputation for honesty, integrity and fairness.'\" The lawsuit was settled out of court and the filmmakers were allowed to resume negotiations with distributors.\n\nThe film premiered in Hollywood on October 9, 2018 at the Saban Theatre. It was released in approximately 650 theaters across the United States on October 12, 2018.\n\nA \"Washington Times\" article reported that the filmmakers were anticipating a lack of interest from the \"left-leaning media\" and that they would instead utilize social media, word-of-mouth, and reaching out to non-media influencers to garner support for the film. Executive producer John Sullivan said their marketing budget would focus on women 35 and older living within 15 miles of a theater showing the film. Sullivan said they were \"not naive\" about the increased public conversation about \"Roe v. Wade\" sparked by the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court and that they would \"embrace it in a way and have a discussion about it.\"\n\nThe producers attempted to purchase airtime on National Public Radio (NPR) to promote the film, but NPR responded that the announcements could not use the terms \"abortionist\" or \"abortion doctor.\" The producers declined to agree to NPR's stipulations and thus did not go through with the purchase.\n\nUpon its release, the film received only two reviews from large media sources: the \"Los Angeles Times\" and \"Forbes\". \"The Seattle Times\" noted in its October 12 new-release coverage that no advance press screening was held for the film. Other media such as \"NBC News\" and \"Washington Times\" reported without a review: focusing on the politics and morals of abortion, or on the relationship between the film and the case it was based on. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a \"rotten\" score of 50%, based on 12 reviews.\n\nIn first weekend of release, \"Gosnell\" earned $1,162,988 on 673 screens, making it the 12th highest earner by total revenue, although the film’s average performance of $1,728 per screen was only the 27th highest that weekend. In its second weekend, the film dropped to 511 screens and earned $640,283, averaging $1,253 per screen.\n\nThe filmmakers alleged that some movie theaters, including 15 multiplexes, dropped the film after its first weekend for political reasons.\n\n"}

{"id": "14119018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14119018", "title": "Humans vs. Zombies", "text": "Humans vs. Zombies\n\nHumans vs. Zombies (also called HvZ for short) is a live-action game predominantly played at US college campuses. The storyline of the game dictates that players begin as Humans and try to survive a Zombie invasion. The ultimate goal of the game is for either all Humans to be turned into Zombies, or for the humans to survive a set amount of time. Humans can defend themselves using any item that is approved by a moderator and thereby deemed safe and appropriate. The most common equipment includes balled up socks, marshmallows, and foam dart blasters. Humans may throw or launch these items at Zombies, who become stunned once hit. Safe zones are also established so that players can eat and sleep in safety. Zombies, on the other hand, are unarmed and must tag Humans to gain a kill. In some cases, if a kill is not made within a set time period, Zombies \"starve\" and are removed from the field of play.\n\nThe game was created in the fall of 2005 at Goucher College by Chris Weed and Brad Sappington, who have since created an official website with general guideline rules and information for other universities to create and customize their own HvZ game. Final rules are determined by each game's moderators and admins. Since the game's creation, Humans vs. Zombies has been played at over 1,000 locations, spanning across six continents, most notably at Utah State University, University of Maryland - Baltimore County (UMBC), Georgia Tech, Rochester Institute of Technology, and Florida State University.\n\nHumans vs. Zombies has grown in popularity across campuses. While most games deal with relatively few people, some games have grown to have hundreds of participants. Some schools and universities have banned the game due to its perceived violent nature. An increase in sensitivity to gun violence following the 2007 school shooting at Virginia Tech also led to worries about the game's continuation at Goucher and elsewhere, and several games have been shut down due to concerns about Nerf Blasters being used.\n\nWhile predominantly played on campuses, Humans vs Zombies is also played in residential areas, camps, and even military bases.\n\nHumans vs. Zombies is a survival game of tag, where \"human\" players fight off increasingly large numbers of \"zombies\"; if a human is \"turned\" (i.e. tagged), then that player becomes a zombie in turn. At the game's beginning, there are only one or two zombies; the zombies multiply by tagging humans, turning them into zombies after a period of one hour. Humans can defend themselves from zombies by using socks, marshmallows, Nerf Blasters or any other toys deemed safe and appropriate; if a zombie is hit by one of these methods of defense, they are stunned (not allowed to interact with the game in any way) for fifteen minutes. The goal of the zombies is to turn all the humans; the humans, meanwhile, must outlast all the zombies. The official rules, produced by Goucher College students, can also be modified to suit a particular campus. Schools can host their games for free at www.HumansVsZombies.org, the official site for the game.\n\nAlmost all players begin the game as humans, and must keep their ID cards with them at all times in case a zombie attacks them. If they are tagged, they must surrender their card, and become a zombie after one hour has elapsed. To defend themselves, humans are allowed Nerf Blasters, socks, or other approved toys. For protection, humans often band together and either stay hidden or attack the zombies directly. Certain areas are declared \"safe\" and humans can enter these areas without fear of attack. According to the Goucher rules, certain methods of eluding zombies are strictly forbidden; these include use of a car or leaving campus for extended periods. To draw zombies into the open and increase the speed of the game, humans can undertake \"missions\" with varying objectives.\n\nAll zombies wear headbands to distinguish themselves from humans. There is usually at least one original zombie, who starts out the game as a zombie, must start the spread of zombies, and in some rulesets is allowed to be free from wearing a headband for a fixed amount of time. Zombies must gather and input the identification number of all humans that they \"turn\" into the database to keep track of which humans have been converted. If a zombie is hit with a human's dart or sock, they are \"Stunned\" for fifteen minutes and cannot interact with the game until that time is up. If a zombie does not make at least one kill in 48 hours of play, then the zombie starves and leaves the game permanently.\nThe different universities have different rules for the game. For example, depending on the number of players at the university, the game may start with more than one original zombie. Also, the amount of time varies as well as the time each zombie has to get at least one bite before dying. Some administrations bring players back, traditionally as a zombie, in order to make the final mission, objective, or overall finale more interesting.\nThe rules for zombies are also known to change in storylines, traditionally after completed missions. This can include alternate stun times, transformation times, or death times. These possibilities make a zombie generally more directly affected by stories than humans.\n\nPeople who are not registered players are not allowed to interfere with gameplay. Under the original rules, this includes spying on the other team, or helping players stay in a safe area by bringing them food or doing something for a player which would otherwise require them to leave a safe-zone. If a non-player is shot with a Nerf dart or attacked by a player in any way, they should report the player(s) involved if the incident was intentional. Players who attack non-players will be banned under most rules. The original rules, and most University custom rules, stress the importance of safety in the game. The rules stress the safety of the players and non-players by not allowing realistic looking weaponry, weaponry which could hurt on impact, or dangerous behavior during gameplay.\n\nSince Humans vs. Zombies can last for days, rules establish \"safe zones\" where gameplay does not take place, and where players can stop participation in the game for a certain period. Safe zones are designated by the administrators in conjunction with University rules and/or other applicable rules. Safe zones include dorm rooms, bathrooms, dining halls, Academic buildings, Health centers and other such places. Safe zones vary by the rules set at each separate University. Some include every building on the campus and all vehicles, others may exclude some, but not all buildings and vehicles. Players are also considered safe attending a mandatory academic or athletic event. They are not safe, however, going to or coming from these events. Some colleges also consider a \"wheel rule\" where players are in a safe zone if they are on a skateboard, bicycle, or wearing rollerblades. Generally, HvZ is played on-campus, so off-campus is considered a safe zone as well. Under the original rules, however, all Humans must sleep on-campus and being away for longer than 24 hours warrants automatic death or removal. Every area not designated a safe zone by administrators is considered a free-play area where players may tag or be tagged. Under the original rules, the game is played at all times and never stops until the game has reached the conclusion.\n\nSome universities incorporate missions into the game play to encourage more active participation. These missions usually come with a reward for the winning side. This reward could benefit the winners or it could penalize the losing side, and thus benefit the winning side. Missions can easily be modified in-game to account for how many players are humans and how many are zombies, or to make the mission easier for one side and/or harder for the opposing side. Missions can also be constructed to follow a storyline throughout the game.\n\nHumans vs. Zombies was a showcased nominee and received the Kids Choice award at IndieCade in 2010.\n\nHumans vs. Zombies games have at times come under scrutiny by concerned members of communities in and around colleges. Many colleges have banned the game outright due to concerns about gun violence. Goucher College and other universities playing the game came under particular scrutiny after the Virginia Tech shootings in 2007; reporter Laura Wexler of \"The Washington Post\" stated that since the games are occurring in the midst of several shootings, \"[there has been] a heightened sensitivity and fear, and desire to prevent such occurrences. The reaction may not be completely rational, but it is understandable\". For instance, Alfred University was locked down on April 8, 2008 after reports that a young man was carrying a gun around before police determined the \"gun\" was a toy and the student was a participant in a Humans vs. Zombies game. Goucher college president Sanford J. Ungar released a statement saying:\n\nIt is unfortunate that the latest round of \"Humans vs. Zombies\" was playing itself out on the day of the events at Virginia Tech, and it is true that the student organizers of the game must be more vigilant about keeping it from interfering with classes and disrupting the daily lives of those who would prefer not to be involved in it. We are working with them to assess the game and its future at Goucher.\n\nIn response to these complaints, game moderator Max Temkin said, \"It's unfortunate that people feel threatened at Goucher. . . If people are concerned about their well-being, they should probably go to Public Safety and report the nature of their concern. No one's ever been hurt by a Nerf gun in our game.\" \n\nThere is also the controversy over what is appropriate dress for players. Many players wear BDU, tactical vests, and camouflage clothing of myriad patterns and designs. In response to players wearing military garb, Temkin said, \"The players I know of that were wearing these fatigues were players who are in the military, and as far as I'm concerned, they've earned the right to wear that uniform however and wherever they please, and it's not up to me or anyone else to tell them not to wear it.\"\n\nFollowing the Virginia Tech shootings, the game was banned outright at some colleges. Other college administrations banned Nerf blasters instead to discourage the game, but students were still allowed to use balled up socks or marshmallows, which students have admitted are not as much fun. Many campuses who responded negatively following the shootings have since repealed the Nerf bans, though others remain in place.\n\nAfter a performance at Ball State University on March 1, 2010, comedian Ethan Fixell of Dave and Ethan criticized students who play the school's popular Humans vs. Zombies game during an interview with the BSU Daily News. Fixell said \"Humans Versus Zombies is a woman repellent. It’s like anti-cologne. \" Some students felt that these remarks were inaccurate, as many of the players of the Ball State Humans vs. Zombies game are women.\n\nA few weeks later, Fixell defended his stance in an interview with HumansVsZombies.org.\n\nAt the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the 2013 Fall game was postponed for a month after a shooting incident on Langdon Street. The following message sent out to players by the moderators explains it best:\n\nAfter talking briefly with the University and UWPD, we the moderators have decided that the game is going to be suspended indefinitely ... as we want to remain sensitive to the fluid events happening on campus. In the interest in continuing to play Humans versus Zombies here, we have decided it is in everyones best interest if we delay the rest of the round.\nAt Bridgewater State University, the second 2013 Fall game was suspended and later cancelled after a participant was arrested for suspicious activity.\n\nSome Humans vs. Zombies clubs have made an effort to replace the word \"gun\" when referring to equipment with the word \"blaster.\" This allows Humans vs. Zombies players to try to distance themselves from the controversy. The Humans vs. Zombies club at some universities such as UMBC takes this further and enforces responsible behavior from their players. When referring to irresponsible behavior, one UMBC moderator has even said \"We will deny you were ever a part of this club\", referring to if a player engaged in especially irresponsible behavior.\n\nBrian T. Jaynes directed the 2011 film version of the live role-playing game Humans vs. Zombies. \"Humans vs. Zombies\" was filmed in Pittsburg, Texas and stars Madison Burge, Melissa Carnell, Frederic Doss, Chip Joslin, Jessica Hecker, Jesse Ferraro, and Rheagan Wallace. The comic artist Russell Foxx exclusively drew a motion comic sequel for the DVD release.\n\n\n"}

It was later ported to Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC) and published by 2K Games in 2007. Later ports to macOS (2008) and mobile platforms (2016) were handled respectively by TransGaming and Aspyr. Set in a world based on Chinese mythology, players control the last surviving Spirit Monk on a quest to save their tutor Master Li and defeat the forces of corrupt emperor Sun Hai. The Spirit Monk is guided through a linear narrative, completing quests and engaging in action-based combat. With morality-based dialogue choices during conversations, the player can impact both story and gameplay progression in various ways.\n\nDevelopment of \"Jade Empire\" began in 2001 as a dream project for company co-founders Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, who acted as the game's executive producers. Their first original role-playing intellectual property, the game reused the morality system from \"\", but switched to a real-time combat system. The game's many elements such as its combat system, the world and script, the constructed language created for the game, and the musical score by Jack Wall drew influence from Chinese history, culture and folklore. Upon release, it received widespread critical acclaim. Its success led to the creation of the PC version, which provided the basis for future ports and itself met with positive reviews.\n\n\"Jade Empire\" is an action role-playing game (RPG) in which players take control of a character most frequently dubbed the \"Spirit Monk\"; the Spirit Monk has six available pre-set character archetypes with different statistics: these statistics are split into health, magic energy (chi) and Focus, used to slow down time during combat. The characters are divided into three male and three female characters, with a fourth male character being available in later versions. Exploration is carried out from a third-person perspective through mainly linear or hub-based environments, where quests can be accepted from non-playable characters (NPCs). Completing quests grants rewards of experience points, in-game currency and occasionally fighting techniques. In addition to standard gameplay, players can engage in a shoot 'em up mini-game with a flying machine, earning items and additional experience.\n\nCombat takes place in real-time, with the protagonist and a chosen Follower fighting enemies either individually or in groups. Enemies range in type from normal humans to monsters and spirits. Attacks are divided into normal, heavy attacks which take longer to execute while dealing higher damage, and area attacks which damage multiple surrounding enemies. In addition to blocking, the protagonist and enemies can dodge attacks. The protagonist has access to different techniques, which range from purely offensive or guard-breaking techniques to healing and buffing techniques. Some fighting styles are hand-to-hand, while others are tied to a weapon type. In the console version, techniques are assigned to four face buttons, while the PC version has techniques assigned to number buttons. Magic-based attacks and techniques require Chi to function. Activating Focus during combat slows down time, allowing the protagonist to attack more freely as long as their Focus lasts. Defeated enemies can drop health and Chi.\n\nDialogue choices are tied into the game's moral alignments, called \"Open Palm\" and \"Closed Fist\". Neither path is meant to be based around good and evil, with their morality being based on a character's intent. The Open Palm primarily revolves around altruism, while the Closed Fist believes in self-reliance and can consequently be a more violent path. Selecting dialogue choices aligned to either the Open Palm or Close Fist paths alter how party members and NPCs respond to the protagonist, with a major choice during the final part of the game impacting the protagonist's alignment and the story's ending. Related to this is the ability to romance certain party members; out of two female and one male follower, one female and one male can be romanced by either male or female protagonists, while the second female can be romanced by a male. There is also an option to romance both females by a male protagonist, resulting in a love triangle situation.\n\nThe game's setting - the titular Jade Empire - is a far-eastern kingdom that is based upon many elements taken from the history of Ancient China and Chinese mythology. Humans live side by side in the mortal realm with mystical creatures and monsters, while the heavens are ruled by the August Personage of Jade through a Celestial bureaucracy. Human sorcerers are able to harness the Five Elements in their magic. The two languages spoken in the Jade Empire are English and the ancient Thou Fan tongue; once common, its speakers have become scarcer in the Empire. In the Jade Empire's recent past, a devastating drought threatened to destroy everything, but the drought came to an end through the actions of Sun Hai, current ruling emperor of the Sun dynasty, leading to him being worshiped as the Empire's savior. Key locations include the isolated village of Two Rivers, where the story begins; Tien's Landing, a former major port now shunned due to its dark past; the Imperial Capital, seat of Sun Hi and center of the Jade Empire; and Dirge, a ruined temple haunted by the spirits of its inhabitants.\n\nThe protagonist, whose gender and name can be selected by the player, is a Spirit Monk rescued as a baby when the forces of Sun Li destroyed their tribe. Raised in the isolated village of Two Rivers, the protagonist has been trained in martial arts by \"Master Li\", who is in fact Sun Hai's disgraced brother Sun Li the Glorious Strategist. During their adventure, the protagonist is accompanied by and gains multiple followers. These include Dawn Star, a Two Rivers student who can communicate with the dead; Sagacious Zu, a hermit with a dark past; the Black Whirlwind, a dim yet quick-witted mercenary; Henpecked Hou, a former arena fighter-turned-bunmaker; Wild Flower, a girl who shares her body with the benevolent spirit Chai Ka and the wicked spirit Ya Zhen; Sky, a former thief seeking revenge against his daughter's killers; Kang the Mad, a genius inventor who is in fact the banished deity Lord Lao; and Princess Sun Lian, the daughter of Sun Hi who goes on covert missions using the alias \"Silk Fox\". The main antagonists in \"Jade Empire\" are led by Sun Hai, current ruler of the Jade Empire. He is represented across the Jade Empire by Death's Hand, a black-armoured figure who leads the Lotus Assassins, a formerly monastic group who have turned to terror tactics to maintain order. Other characters include Gao the Greater and his son Gao the Lesser, key characters during the early narrative; and the Water Dragon, shepherd of the dead and a key guide to the protagonist.\n\nShortly after completing their training at Two Rivers, the Spirit Monk helps fend off an attack by a Lotus Assassin, facing undead opponents in the process. Master Li reveals the Spirit Monk's past, his own identity as Sun Li and role in the destruction of Dirge, and the increasing threat of the undead which is tied directly to Emperor Sun Hai. During a final training session to recover an amulet of their people, the Spirit Monk meets the spirit of the Water Dragon, who reveals that Sun Hai has incapacitated her and left the Spirit Monk as the land's only hope. Master Li's preference for the Spirit Monk pushes the impatient Gao the Lesser over the edge, leading to his expulsion. Gao the Lesser then kidnaps Dawn Star and summons Lotus Assassins allied with his father Gao the Greater. The Spirit Monk rescues Dawn Star and defeats Gao the Lesser with help from Sagacious Zu, but the Lotus Assassins—led by Death's Hand and his second-in-command Grand Inquisitor Jia—destroy Two Rivers and capture Master Li.\n\nUsing one of Gao the Greater's airships, the Spirit Monk travels to the village of Tien's Landing. During their time there, they fight and defeat Gao the Greater and learn that Master Li was taken to the Imperial Capital. While there the Spirit Monk finds two missing pieces from their amulet, acquires a map of wind currents which will allow passage to the Imperial Capital, and helps the village by purging the neighbouring Great Southern Forest of a corrupting force and closing a large dam which allows trading vessels to navigate the river again. They are also joined by Wild Flower, who guarded one of the amulet fragments; Black Whirlwind, who was hired to eliminate the monsters in the Great Southern Forest; Sky, who was freeing slaves taken by the Lotus Assassins; and Kang the Man, who was held captive by Gao the Greater. They are also first attacked and then aided by Silk Fox, who is determined to topple Death's Hand.\n\nUsing Kang's special airship, the party travel to the Imperial Capital, where Silk Fox meets them in her true role as Princess Sun Lian. While in the Capital, the Spirit Monk gains access to the Lotus Assassins' ranks by competing in a local fighting tournament. Once among the Locus Assassins, they dismantle them from within before retrieving the final amulet fragment from Grand Inquisitor Jia. Death's Hand then attacks, but Sagacious Zu sacrifices himself to collapse the Lotus Assassin base on Death's Hand. Led by Silk Fox, the group then infiltrate Sun Hai's palace, confronting the Emperor as he interrogates Master Li and finding him withered through using the Water Dragon's stolen power. After defeating him, Master Li kills the Spirit Monk and steals both the completed amulet and the Water Dragon's power, setting himself up as the new Emperor.\n\nThe Spirit Monk is guided back to the living world by the Water Dragon and the ghost of Dirge's abbot, who reveals the truth about Master Li. Sun Li—who orchestrated the entire siege—had conspired with his brothers Sun Hai and Sun Kin to seize the Water Dragon's power and kill Sun Hai. The brothers' plot fails as the Water Dragon's power made Sun Hai immortal. Sun Kin was killed, while Sun Li barely escaped and killed the Spirit Monk's rescuer to use them as a weapon against Sun Hai. Death's Hand was created by the Emperor by binding Sun Kin's spirit to Sun Li's armor. Returning to life in Dirge, the Spirit Monk reunites with their companions and holds off a vast assault from Sun Li, who also sensed their return. Infiltrating the Imperial Capital, the Spirit Monk's party fights their way through the palace and discovers the Water Dragon's body, torn open and preserved in limbo to provide endless water to the Jade Empire. The Spirit Monk then goes to confront Master Li.\n\nDepending on the player's choices at these points, several endings play out. If the Spirit Monk surrenders to Sun Li by not fighting him, they are remembered as a hero who knew their place, as the Empire becomes an oppressive dystopia under Sun Li's rule. If the Water Dragon's corpse is further corrupted by the Spirit Monk, then they usurp Master Li's stolen power and emerge as the next Emperor following his death. If the Spirit Monk destroys the Water Dragon's body, then her spirit is freed, and the dead are able to find their way into the underworld, causing the people to rejoice and hail the Spirit Monk as a hero of the Jade Empire.\n\n\"Jade Empire\" was developed by BioWare, after it earned critical and commercial success with \"Baldur's Gate\", \"Neverwinter Nights\" and \"\", RPGs based on pre-existing \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and \"Star Wars\" fictional universes. The game, which began development in May 2001, was the company's first original RPG intellectual property. The concept of \"Jade Empire\" had existed with company founders co-founders Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk since they started BioWare alongside the plan which would lead to \"Baldur's Gate\"; called a \"dream project\", their aim was to fulfill player fantasies of becoming a powerful martial arts master. The game was first developed and released for the Xbox. Zeschuk later felt they should have held the game back and developed it for the console's successor the Xbox 360.\n\nArt director Matt Goldman took inspiration from multiple eras of China's history when designing various aspects of the world, focusing between the Han and Ming dynasties. The environments were modeled on landscape artwork from the Song dynasty, while the color palette drew from the green-hued art of the Tang dynasty. For ancient artifacts based in an ancient civilization, Goldman drew inspiration from bronze artifacts dating from the Shang and Zhou periods. The wild areas were directly inspired by the Huangshan region. Different regions of the game were designed to reflect the differing social classes present in the Jade Empire. In addition to its Chinese inspiration, Goldman drew styling elements for both clothing and scenery from Japan, Thailand, Tibet, the Khmer Empire, and unspecified areas of South and West Asia. The monsters, while taking inspiration from brief descriptions in Asian literature, were mostly original creations for the game's world. Speaking of his experience on the game years later, Goldman described \"fond memories\" of the Canada-based development team working to create an Asian epic.\n\nCreating the new combat system was the one of the biggest challenges when developing the gameplay systems. Rather than the rule and turn-based combat of their earlier titles, the team wanted combat in \"Jade Empire\" to be in real-time, as the slower turn-based combat of their earlier works did not fit into its planned setting. The game's martial arts were based on a variety of real-life styles, including karate, aikido and capoeira. Implementing the combat system required creating a number of systems to handle combat without relying on pre-programmed fight choreography. A key element of the design was that managing character statistics was kept low-key so as not to interfere with the player's experience. The Dragonfly mini-game was designed by assistant producer Sheldon Carter. Carter based the mini-game on classic arcade top-down shooters such as \"Xevious\" and \"1942\".\n\nBased on their experience with \"Knights of the Old Republic\", the team developed \"Jade Empire\" using a new graphics engine. As part of the lighting system, the team used rim lighting to pick out the edges of characters and illuminate them using a local light source, creating a dynamic lighting effect to make characters look alive. A form of pixel flare, in which pixels reflect more light in bright conditions, was used to the same effect for areas in bright sunlight or the unrealistic lighting of parts of Heaven. The user interface, map and journal systems were all improved based on those used in \"Knights of the Old Republic\" to promote player comfort. The game was the first BioWare game to use motion capture for all human elements, contrasting with their work on \"Knights of the Old Republic\" which was done using hand animation. The use motion capture was intended to promote a sense of realism. The decision to use motion capture was influenced by the large number of animations required for combat actions. For several enemy characters, the staff used hand animation. When creating the prototype \"Deo\" fighting style, lead animator Deo Perez drew inspiration from a number of martial arts masters from movies including Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. Further refinement was done by the motion capture actors. Each style was based on a single real-life martial arts style.\n\nWhile their previous work on other licenses had been fun, BioWare were excited to create a new world and storyline without any restrictions. The team quickly decided not to set the game in historical China, wanting the freedom to include fantasy elements, leading to them creating a world based on Chinese mythology. According to lead writers Luke Kristjanson and Mike Laidlaw, they used its inspiration to create a world that felt alive, with a variety of locals and social norms coexisting. Like BioWare's previous RPGs, its main focus was on telling a story, but a lot of the additional lore and finer detail was made optional so players would feel a degree of freedom in how they explored the story. Dialogue was intended to blend BioWare's established writing style with the game's Eastern influences. The game's morality system was designed to be an evolution and refinement of that used in \"Knights of the Old Republic\". The menu-based dialogue choice system was carried over directly from \"Knights of the Old Republic\".\n\nThe inspirations for the game's plot included the Classic Chinese Novels \"Outlaws of the Marsh\", \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" and \"Journey to the West\", in addition to \"Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio\" and more recent works such as \"The Deer and the Cauldron\", \"Lone Wolf and Cub\" and \"Bridge of Birds\". They also drew inspiration from Wuxia and samurai movies including \"Seven Samurai\", \"Fist of Legend\", \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", \"Hero\", \"Shaolin Dolemite\" and \"The Five Fingers of Death\". The character Black Whirlwind was a homage by Laidlaw to Li Kui, a main character from \"Outlaws of the Marsh\". Henpecked Hou followed a tradition in BioWare titles of including a character for comic relief, in addition to playing on Chinese narrative stereotypes. A notable side character is Sir Roderick Ponce Von Fontlebottom, an explorer from a foreign land used for comic relief. The character was generally influenced by the explorers of Medieval Europe who had historically been to China.\n\nWhile much of the script is in English, many characters in the game speak Thou Fan, a 2,500-word Asian-style constructed language translated for players using English subtitles. Similar to the development of the Klingon language for \"Star Trek\" and the Elvish languages for \"The Lord of the Rings\", Thou Fan was developed to add to the personality, realism and immersion of to the setting of \"Jade Empire\". The team chose not to use a real-world Asian language as \"Jade Empire\" was set in a fantasy world despite its Asian influence, with Thou Fan being used to add a level of exoticism for players. To create Thou Fan, BioWare contacted the linguistics department of the nearby University of Alberta; one of those who responded was Wolf Wikeley, then a student at the University with a master's degree in psycholinguistics and a candidate for a PhD in phonology. When Wikeley—a fan of Japanese anime and video games—was interviewed, he spoke several sentences in fluent Klingon, impressing the BioWare staff and earning him the job. The language, according to Wikeley, relies on soft sounds and most closely resembles Mongolian. When planning the new language, Wikeley asked the developers who temperament the people of the Jade Empire had, as it would impact the sound and delivery of the words. After this is worked on creating a basic dictionary based on word substitution, although some words were inside jokes such as \"wankaawayi\" (director) which referenced Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai. Once the dictionary was complete, Wikeley set about creating unique grammar and language rules, such as the verb \"to be\" not existing, so it would not make the typical mistake of fictional languages of following the rules of a real language. Initially intended to be a lower class language denoting humility, a late change to the plot made Thou Fan a language of the Jade Empire's elite, turning its \"deferential softness\" into a mark of elegance.\n\nThe musical score of \"Jade Empire\" was composed by Jack Wall, who had previously worked on \"\" and . Wall was first approached by an audio manager at BioWare, with Wall later sending a demo tape, then later created a piece used in the game's first trailer. Wall decided to pursue the job because of his liking for BioWare's previous games, and accredited the trailer music with successfully getting the job of composer. Wall worked on the game from January 2004 to February 2005, coming in during the game's early development. From an early stage, Wall decided to create an orchestral rather than synthetic soundtrack, aiming for an \"East meets West\" aesthetic. A key member of staff whom Wall hired early on was Zhiming Han, a Chinese music consultant who was instrumental in maintaining the authentic sound of the score. Zhiming brought in several native Chinese musicians to perform the score, and helped by translating Wall's score into Chinese musical notation for the performers. The score was intended to feel generally Asian, incorporating traditional Chinese and Japanese percussion and wind instruments. Wall estimated that he composed over 90 minutes of music, ranging from environmental to cutscene-specific tracks, not including additional arrangements for shorter cutscenes by BioWare staff. A soundtrack album was released in 2005.\n\nEvery line of dialogue in the game, both English and Thou Fan, was fully voiced; Zeschuk and Martens estimated in different interviews that the recorded script came to over 320,000 words. The character of Dawn Star had 20,000 lines dedicated to her. One of the notable cast members was Nathan Fillion, whose role in the game was one of his earliest video game acting jobs. According to him, the script was written in a style he compared to broken English. When he talked with other actors on the project after the game was completed, he realized that they had rewritten the script into conventional English. He stated in 2017 that he would enjoy redoing those lines so they were easier to understand. Another notable cast member was British actor John Cleese, who voiced Sir Roderick Ponce Von Fontlebottom. Cleese became involved due to him and his agent being in Canada at the time voice recording was taking place. Upon being approached, Cleese was willing, and recorded all the character's lines during a single afternoon.\n\nFirst hinted at in 2002 when BioWare announced a further partnership with Microsoft Game Studios following \"Knights of the Old Republic\", the game was officially announced in September 2003, with further information being revealed at that year's Tokyo Game Show. Originally scheduled for release in March 2005, the game was pushed forward to April of that year. Along with the standard edition, a limited edition was produced which included an additional male playable character with unique combat abilities, and a special DVD detailing the production of multiple Xbox titles including \"Jade Empire\". The limited edition was designed as a gift for those who pre-ordered the game, and was developed in parallel to the standard game. By February, the game had entered the final stages of production, with staff focusing on polishing work. The game released on April 12, 2005, two days prior to its announced release date. The game was later released in Europe on April 22, and in Australia on June 30. The limited edition, exclusive to North America and Europe, released alongside the standard edition. In Japan, the game was released on June 16 under the title \"Jade Empire: Hisui no Teikoku\".\n\nA version for Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC) began development at BioWare due to demand from their strong PC-based community. While developing the port, BioWare upgraded hundreds of different textures by hand; additional content including new fighting styles, new enemies, and the seventh character previously available in the Limited Edition of the Xbox version; refined the enemy and followers' artificial intelligence and reworked the controls for a keyboard and mouse. While the team had the option of publishing the title through Microsoft Game Studio, Microsoft were focused on developing games for the Windows Vista alone, which clashed with BioWare's wishes to make the game available to a wide audience. For this reason, the team developed the PC version themselves and sought out a different publisher.\n\nThe PC version was first announced at the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Unlike the Xbox version, the PC version was published by 2K Games. The game went gold in February 2007, shortly before its North American release. The game released on February 27, 2007 in North America. It later released on March 2 in Europe and Australia. The downloadable version was released through Steam and BioWare's online store on February 28. It later released through GOG.com on June 11, 2013. A port of \"Special Edition\" for macOS was developed and published by TransGaming on August 18, 2008. Later ports for iOS and Android were developed and published by Aspyr respectively on October 6 and November 15, 2016.\n\n\"Computer and Video Games\" spoke highly of the game, saying that the game's accessibility would attract those introduced to BioWare's \"Knights of the Old Republic\", calling \"Jade Empire\" \"imaginative, accessible, beautiful to look at and incredibly immersive to play\". Rob Fahey of Eurogamer praised the aesthetics and replay value, but noted that the combat's lack of depth and limited customization options would be negatively viewed by some players. Writing for GameSpot's Greg Kasavin was positive overall, his only complains being issues with combat balance and the game's short length. Will Tuttle of GameSpy lauded every aspect of the game, calling it \"the best [RPG] to ever hit the Xbox\". IGN's David Clayman was again highly positive, noting only camera difficulties that distracted from the flow of combat. Luke van Leuveran of PALGN called \"Jade Empire\" \"an amazing action RPG\", praising its story and combat system. Reviews of the Xbox version were positive overall, with the graphics and storyline coming in for the majority of praise. While the gameplay was seen as solid, its simplicity was frequently criticized.\n\nSuzy Wallace of \"Computer and Video Games\" felt that the \"Special Edition\" managed to reach beyond its roots on the Xbox to become a good-quality RPG for PCs, despite dated graphics and gameplay pacing issues. Fahay, returning to review the PC port, was disappointed at the lack of graphical polish and technical upgrades over its console counterpart. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd shared points of praise and criticism with the Xbox review, while also noting that the PC version had few noticeable enhancements over the Xbox version. GameSpy's Allen Rausch enjoyed the storyline and gameplay, but noted the game's \"grainy\" cutscenes and some technical issues. Steve Butts, writing for IGN, generally enjoyed the game but found the combat repetitive and noted a lack of new content. Niel Booth, reviewing for PALGN, said that the game was enjoyable despite graphical and technical issues he raised. While sentiments towards the story and gameplay remained unchanged for the PC version, people noted that the original gameplay faults were heightened by the PC controls and that the graphics looked dated by modern gaming standards.\n\nLater responses have continued to be positive. In 2010, the game was included in the book \"1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die\". In a 2015 article, Mike Williams of USgamer said, \"\"Jade Empire\" was such a unique game for BioWare, but it's one the studio never followed up on.\"\n\nUpon its release, \"Jade Empire\" debuted at #3 on The NPD Group's video game sales chart for the month of April 2005. Writing for GameSpot, Tor Thorsen noted that its third-place finish came \"despite [its] being released in the middle of April\". It also secured second place on that month's Xbox chart, behind the debut of \"Doom 3\" on the platform. In May, the game fell to last place on NPD's multiplatform top 20, and to seventh in the Xbox rankings. It was absent from both lists by the following month. According to NPD, the game's North American sales surpassed 385,000 units by May 2006.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Jade Empire\" debuted at #7 on Chart-Track's multiplatform sales list for the week ending April 23. David Jenkins of Gamasutra called this \"an unremarkable opening\", and suggested that its sales had been damaged by competition from the newly-released \"\". It fell to 12th place in its second week, and to 20th in its third. IGN's staff wrote of this decline, \"The Bioware-developed game has been well reviewed over the past month, but that hasn't helped it from rapidly dropping down the charts.\" It was absent from Chart-Track's multiplatform top 40 by its fourth week of release. Conversely, on the firm's sales list for Xbox games, \"Jade Empire\" opened in first place and held the position for its debut 14 days. It fell to #5 in its third week, but remained in the top 10 until the week ending June 18. By the end of 2005, \"Jade Empire\"s sales totaled 45,000 copies in the United Kingdom, a performance characterized as substandard by Eurogamer's Kristan Reed.\n\nAs of October 2007, sales of \"Jade Empire\" had reached 500,000 units. BioWare's Greg Zeschuk later lamented the decision to release the game for Xbox, rather than as an Xbox 360 launch title. Speaking in 2013, he noted that \"game sales are down [right now] because people are waiting for new consoles, and we released \"Jade Empire\" into that kind of window.\" Zeschuck concluded that \"it would've been great to put off a bit and polish the game a bit more.\"\n\nThe decision to focus on both \"Jade Empire\" and their fantasy-themed \"\" resulted in BioWare passing over developing a sequel to \"Knights of the Old Republic\". The sequel, titled \"\", was given to Obsidian Entertainment. Alongside his work on \"Jade Empire\", Wikeley also created four different constructed languages for the \"Dragon Age\" series. Wall would also work with BioWare again on \"Mass Effect\" and its sequel.\n\nIn January 2007, BioWare staff announced there were no plans to develop \"Jade Empire 2\". However, BioWare co-founders Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk stated in September 2011: \"It's an IP, it's a setting that we were really passionate about, and we still are. Both Greg and I were big believers in the IP... We're just looking for the right way to deploy it.\" In 2009, GamesRadar included \"Jade Empire\" among the games \"with untapped franchise potential\", commenting: \"The original game had all the trappings of franchise material with engrossing characters, magnificent settings, and a unique take on martial arts-fueled RPG combat. But until hard evidence of a sequel's existence materializes, we’ll continue yearning for BioWare's one-off hit to attain franchise status.\"\n\n"}

Born into poverty in London, she and her siblings were deserted by their parents. Following unhappy spells in the workhouse and with an aunt, she left home at 14. After sleeping rough in Brewer Street, Soho, she joined a travelling fair, where she got the idea for her act after seeing a professional strong man at work.\n\nShe began as a variety and cabaret performer during the 1950s and '60s. Her popularity increased due to her early appearances on television shows in the US and UK, including \"The Toast Of The Town\" (1955) and the \"Bob Hope Christmas Show\". It was in the latter that, on stage in Iceland on 27 December 1955, that Rhodes lifted, then accidentally dropped, Hope, while entertaining troops for the USO.\n\nRhodes could bend iron bars across her knee, in her mouth and around her arm or neck. She ripped telephone directories, often ripping two simultaneously and ripping others into quarters. She lifted large men over her head or into her arms, including 450 lb boxer Ewart Potgeiter and giant Ted Evans, who reportedly weighed over 480 lbs. She frequently ended her act by lifting four male audience members at the same time. Other parts of her stage routine included allowing men to try to bend iron bars before she would, arm-wrestling two men at once (one with each hand as each man was allowed to use two arms), lifting jeeps and small cars and pushing them offstage while men sat in them, and defeating a team of four men in tugs of war. \n\nRhodes was a lifelong friend of author Quentin Crisp.\n\nAs a stunt performer, she worked on films, including \"Fanny by Gaslight\" (1944). She appeared as herself performing some of her strength feats in the Vernon Sewell-directed crime caper, \"Johnny, You're Wanted\" (1956). She also appeared in \"Burke and Hare\" (1971), \"The Pink Panther Strikes Again\" (1976) and \"The Elephant Man\" (1980).\n\nHer autobiography, \"Coming on Strong\", was published in 2007.

Between 1892 and 1897 he recorded extensively for the New Jersey Phonograph Company and its successor the United States Phonograph Company. He specialized in vaudeville sketches and comic songs, but also sang sentimental ballads popular at the time. He returned to Columbia in 1898 for an exclusive contract then began recording for Berliner Gramophone (disc) records in 1899 and continued with Victor and Columbia as discs became the dominant format in the early 1900s.\n\nHe began performing with banjoist Vess L. Ossman in 1901 and with Ada Jones in 1905. He is best remembered today for his vaudeville-style comic sketches, such as the \"Arkansaw Traveler\", combining clever turns of phrase, ironic elocutionary delivery, sound effects and music to create colorful dialogues featuring itinerant Southerners, auctioneers, circus barkers, and Irish, Jewish or Black Americans.\n\nAs the popularity of Len's style of humor waned in the latter part of the decade, he opened a booking agency called \"Len Spencer's Lyceum\" in New York.

They had so many imitators, the name became synonymous with belly dancers generally.\n\nFahreda Mazar Spyropoulos, (c. 1871 – April 5, 1937), also performing under the stage name Fatima, got her start at the Bird Cage Theatre in Tombstone, Arizona. In 1893 she appeared at the \"Street in Cairo\" exhibition on the Midway at the World's Columbian Exposition, held in Chicago. Legend has it that Mark Twain had a near fatal heart attack watching her go through her paces, but this story is unreliable.\n\nAshea Wabe (born Catherine Devine (1871 – January 3, 1908) danced at the Seeley banquet in New York in 1896, enjoying a fleeting \"succès de scandale\".\n\nFatima Djemille (died March 14, 1921) appeared at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair.\n\nLorraine Shalhoub (born December 20 1931 in Brooklyn) used the name Little Egypt for her acting career.\n\nFarida Mazar Spyropoulos, a belly dancer who went by the stage name of \"Fatima\" got her start at the Bird Cage Theatre in Tombstone, Arizona in 1881. In the reopened saloon's lobby hangs a larger-than-life sized painting she donated entitled \"Fatima\". It bears six patched bullet holes; one can be seen above the belly-button and a knife gash in the canvas below the knee. \n\nIn 1893 Spyropoulos went to Chicago to appear at the World's Columbian Exposition. At the Egyptian Theater on the fair's Midway Raqs dancers performed for the first time in the United States. Sol Bloom presented a show titled \"The Algerian Dancers of Morocco\" at the attraction called \"A Street in Cairo\" produced by Gaston Akoun, which included Spyropoulos, though she was neither Egyptian nor Algerian, but Syrian. Spyropoulos, the wife of a Chicago restaurateur and businessman who was a native of Greece, was billed as Fatima, but because of her size, she had been called \"Little Egypt\" as a backstage nickname.\n\nSpyropoulos gained wide attention, and popularized this form of dancing, which came to be referred to as the \"Hoochee-Coochee\", or the \"shimmy and shake\". At that time the word \"bellydance\" had not yet entered the American vocabulary, as Spyropoulos was the first in the U.S. to demonstrate the \"danse du ventre\" (literally \"dance of the belly\") first seen by the French during Napoleon's incursions into Egypt at the end of the 18th century. \n\nSome time after the fair Spyropoulos went to Europe, and performed under the stage name \"Little Egypt.\" \n\nSubsequently, several women dancers adopted the name of Little Egypt and toured the United States performing some variation of this dance, until the name became somewhat synonymous with exotic dancers, and often associated with the Dance of the Seven Veils. Spyropoulos then claimed to be the original Little Egypt from the Chicago Fair. Recognized as the true Little Egypt, she always disliked being confused with Ashea Wabe, after Wabe's performance at the Seeley banquet in 1896 ended up in her arrest and a full-scale New York City scandal.\n\nSpyropoulos danced as Little Egypt at the 1933 Century of Progress in Chicago at the age of 62.\n\nAt the time of her death, she had filed suit against Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for the use of her name in the motion picture \"The Great Ziegfeld\", claiming that the producers of the movie failed to ask her consent.\n\nAshea Wabe became front-page news in 1896 after she danced at a swank Fifth Avenue bachelor party for Herbert Seeley. A rival promoter reported that Wabe was going to dance nude and the party was raided by the vice squad. Though the raid precluded Wabe from completing her act, she nonetheless admitted to local authorities that she had been paid to dance and pose \"in the all-together\", a euphemism for having no clothes on. Theodore Roosevelt, then a New York City Police Commissioner, supported the police captain who conducted the raid and who was subsequently vilified by the city media for interfering with a party held by upstanding gentlemen. Only later did the story come out that Wabe (a.k.a. Little India) had every intention of performing in the nude and would have done so had the police raid not occurred.\n\nThe raid brought some amount of fame to Wabe. She was hired by Broadway impresario Oscar Hammerstein I to appear as herself in a humorous parody of the Seeley dinner. She might have then been forgotten except for a series of photographs taken by Benjamin Falk.\n\nOn January 5, 1908, she was found dead in her apartment at 236 West 37th Street, New York City, by her sister, having apparently died from gas asphyxiation. She was said to have left an estate of over $200,000.\n\nFatima was the subject of two early films, Edison's \"Coochee Coochee Dance\" (1896) and \"Fatima\" (1897).\n\n\n\n\n\"Loving Little Egypt\" is the title of a Thomas McMahon novel, set in the late 19th century.\n\n\n\n"}

Sometimes sets and equipment for a traveling show are delivered through a bay, other times, the bay could be used for delivery of supplies and lumber for set construction. In a smaller theaters, the bay may serve as a theater, green room, or scene shop.\nIn most union work, teamsters and grips who unload trucks and move equipment are different from the carpenters, electricians, and other stagehands who assemble a show. By Union rules, generally teamsters are not permitted to work on the actual performance, and the stagehands are not allowed to even enter trucks.

{"id": "25622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25622", "title": "Richard Bachman", "text": "Richard Bachman\n\nRichard Bachman is a pen name used by horror fiction author Stephen King.\n\nAt the beginning of Stephen King's career, the general view among publishers was that an author was limited to one book per year, since publishing more would be unacceptable to the public. King therefore wanted to write under another name, in order to increase his publication without over-saturating the market for the King \"brand\". He convinced his publisher, Signet Books, to print these novels under a pseudonym.\n\nIn his introduction to \"The Bachman Books,\" King states that adopting the nom de plume Bachman was also an attempt to make sense out of his career and try to answer the question of whether his success was due to talent or luck. He says he deliberately released the Bachman novels with as little marketing presence as possible and did his best to \"load the dice against\" Bachman. King concludes that he has yet to find an answer to the \"talent versus luck\" question, as he felt he was outed as Bachman too early to know. The Bachman book \"Thinner\" (1984) sold 28,000 copies during its initial run—and then ten times as many when it was revealed that Bachman was, in fact, King.\n\nThe pseudonym King originally selected (Gus Pillsbury) is King's maternal grandfather's name, but at the last moment (due to the pseudonym being ousted) King changed it to Richard Bachman. Richard is a tribute to crime author Donald E. Westlake's long-running pseudonym Richard Stark. (The surname Stark \"was\" later used in King's novel \"The Dark Half,\" in which an author's malevolent pseudonym, \"George Stark\", comes to life.) Bachman was inspired by Bachman–Turner Overdrive, a rock and roll band King was listening to at the time his publisher asked him to choose a pseudonym on the spot.\n\nKing provided biographical details for Bachman, initially in the \"about the author\" blurbs in the early novels. Known \"facts\" about Bachman were that he was born in New York, served a four-year stint in the Coast Guard, which he then followed with ten years in the merchant marines. Bachman finally settled down in rural central New Hampshire, where he ran a medium-sized dairy farm, writing at night. His fifth novel was dedicated to his wife, Claudia Inez Bachman, who also received credit for the bogus author photo on the book jacket. Other \"facts\" about the author were revealed in publicity dispatches from Bachman's publishers: the Bachmans had one child, a boy, who died in an unfortunate, Stephen King-ish type accident at the age of six, when he fell through a well and drowned. In 1982, a brain tumour was discovered near the base of Bachman's brain; tricky surgery removed it. After Bachman's true identity was revealed, later publicity dispatches (and \"about the author\" blurbs) revealed that Bachman died suddenly in late 1985 of \"cancer of the pseudonym, a rare form of schizonomia\".\n\nKing dedicated Bachman's early books—\"Rage\" (1977), \"The Long Walk\" (1979), \"Roadwork\" (1981), and \"The Running Man\" (1982)—to people close to him. The link between King and his shadow writer was exposed after a Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, noted similarities between the writing styles of King and Bachman. Brown located publisher's records at the Library of Congress which included a document naming King as the author of one of Bachman's novels. Brown wrote to King's publishers with a copy of the documents he had uncovered, and asked them what to do. Two weeks later, King telephoned Brown personally and suggested he write an article about how he discovered the truth, allowing himself to be interviewed. At the time of the announcement in 1985, King was working on \"Misery,\" which he had planned to release as a Bachman book.\n\nIn 1987, the Bachman novel \"The Running Man\" inspired the Paul Michael Glaser film of the same name. King insisted that his name not be on the credits, and the screen credit for the film went to Richard Bachman.\n\nKing used the \"relationship\" between himself and Bachman as a concept in his 1989 book \"The Dark Half.\" In the novel a writer's darker pseudonym takes on a life of its own. King dedicated \"The Dark Half\" to \"the late Richard Bachman.\" Originally there were plans to make the book a collaboration between the two, although this was later scrapped.\n\nIn 1996, Bachman's \"The Regulators\" came out, with the publishers claiming the book's manuscript was found among Bachman's leftover papers by his widow. It was released as a companion novel with King's \"Desperation\"; the two novels took place in different universes but featured many of the same characters. The two book covers were designed to be placed together to form a single picture. In the foreword by King included with \"Desperation\" he said that there may be another Bachman novel left to be \"found.\"\n\nThe next Bachman book to be \"discovered\" was \"Blaze.\" \"Blaze\" was, in fact, an unpublished novel of King's written before \"Carrie\" or the creation of Richard Bachman. For its publication King rewrote, edited, and updated the entire novel. It was published in 2007 under the Bachman pseudonym, with a foreword by King under his own name.\n\nKing has taken full ownership of the Bachman name on numerous occasions, as with the republication of the first four Bachman titles as \"The Bachman Books: Four Early Novels by Stephen King\" in 1985. The introduction, titled \"Why I Was Bachman\", details the whole Bachman/King story. (In 1996, the collection was reissued with a new King essay, \"The Importance of Being Bachman\".)\n\nRichard Bachman was also referred to in Stephen King's \"The Dark Tower\" series of books. In the fifth book, \",\" the sinister children's book \"Charlie the Choo Choo\" is revealed to be written by \"Claudia y Inez Bachman.\" The spelling discrepancy of the added 'y' was later explained as a deus ex machina on the part of \"The White\" (a force of good throughout King's \"Tower\" series) to bring the total number of letters in her name to nineteen, a number prominent in King's series. In the next novel of the series, \",\" Stephen King briefly discusses his Richard Bachman pseudonym.\n\nAfter the Heath High School shooting, King announced that he would allow \"Rage\" to go out of print, fearing that it might inspire similar tragedies. \"Rage\" for a time continued to be available in the United Kingdom in \"The Bachman Books\" collection, although the collection now no longer contains \"Rage\". In a footnote to the preface of \"Blaze,\" dated 30 January 2007, King wrote of \"Rage\": \"Now out of print, and a good thing.\" King's other Bachman novels are available in the US in separate volumes.\n\nIn 2010, King appeared on the FX television show \"Sons of Anarchy\" in a cameo role. His character, named Bachman, performed contract work quietly disposing of deceased bodies.\n\nIn issue 29 of the comic adaptation of \"The Stand\", Richard (Rich) Bachman appears as one of the top lieutenants of Randall Flagg, replacing the character of Whitney Horgan from the original novel. He is drawn to resemble King.\n\nIn the 2013 \"Grimm\" episode \"Nameless\", Richard Bachman, being a pseudonym of Stephen King, was a plot point. King's novel, \"Rage\", had its title page used as a prop for the killer to write a note to the police.\n\n"}

The show parodied current subjects, such as the New York City Subway system and the Theatre Guild (producer of the show). The \"Garrick Gaieties\" is remembered as \"bringing Rodgers and Hart their first major recognition.\" Their hit song \"Manhattan\" was introduced in this revue.\n\nThe revue first opened on Broadway at the Garrick Theatre on May 17, 1925, as a 2-performance benefit for the Theatre Guild. The reviews were favorable, and Rodgers and others persuaded the Theatre Guild to continue the production, which re-opened on June 8, 1925 and ran until November 28, for 211 performances.

It is the sequel to the 1988 film \"\" and the second installment in \"The Naked Gun\" film series. The film stars Leslie Nielsen as the comically bumbling Police Lt. Frank Drebin of \"Police Squad!\". Priscilla Presley plays the role of Jane, with O. J. Simpson as Nordberg and George Kennedy as police captain Ed Hocken. The film also features Robert Goulet (who previously made a \"special guest star\" appearance on \"Police Squad!\") as the villainous Quentin Hapsburg and Richard Griffiths as renewable fuel advocate Dr. Albert S. Meinheimer (as well as his evil double, Earl Hacker). Zsa Zsa Gabor, Mel Tormé and members of the Chicago Bears have cameo roles.\n\nDavid Zucker returns from the first entry as director and screenwriter of the film. Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker serve as executive producers for the film and receive writing credit due to their contributions to the and the \"Police Squad!\" television series. However, neither contributed to the screenplay for the film.\n\nFrank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) is honored at the White House, where President George H. W. Bush (John Roarke) announces that he will base his recommendation for the country's energy program on Dr. Albert Meinheimer's (Richard Griffiths) advice, which will be revealed during the doctor's speech at the National Press Club dinner the following week. The heads of the coal and oil (fossil fuel) and nuclear industries are distressed by this fact, as Dr. Meinheimer is an advocate for renewable energy. Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley), now separated from Frank and working for Dr. Meinheimer, is working late at Meinheimer's research institute when she spots a man leaving in a van. A maintenance worker discovers a clock with dynamite attached and takes it to the security guards, who accidentally trigger it.\n\nThe next morning, Frank reacquaints himself with Jane as he interviews her about the explosion. He is shown around the institute and meets Jane's boyfriend, Hexagon Oil executive Quentin Hapsburg (Robert Goulet), of whom he becomes exceedingly jealous. Frank's boss, Ed Hocken (George Kennedy), finds him and Jane at a lonely blues bar, where Frank promptly blows a chance to make up with her. Meanwhile, at a meeting of the \"energy\" industry leaders, Hapsburg reveals that he has kidnapped Dr. Meinheimer and found an exact double for him, Earl Hacker, who will endorse fossil and nuclear fuels at the Press Club Dinner.\n\nPolice Squad tracks down the van driver, Hector Savage (Anthony James). Once he discovers the cops are onto him, Savage holes up in a house, demanding money. Frank drives a SWAT tank into and through the house, inadvertently allowing Savage to escape, and causes more damage when he loses control of the tank and crashes into the city zoo, allowing the animals to escape. At a party that evening, Frank notices that Dr. Meinheimer does not instantly remember him, despite Jane telling him that Meinheimer had a photographic memory; Frank confronts her with this at her apartment following the party, but is dismissed. Moments later, Savage enters the home and tries to kill Jane. Frank becomes aware of Savage and kills him by sticking a fire hose into his mouth and turning it on full blast. Jane realizes that Frank was right, and the two rekindle their romance.\n\nThe next day Police Squad stakes out Hexagon Oil's headquarters where Dr. Meinheimer is being held. Frank tries to go undercover into the building, but instead is discovered and tied up by Hapsburg's henchmen. Frank and Dr. Meinheimer are eventually freed, and Police Squad proceeds to the Press Club Dinner. Finding their only way in locked, Frank, Ed, Nordberg (O. J. Simpson), and Dr. Meinheimer commandeer a mariachi band's costumes and head inside, where Hacker is eventually intercepted, allowing Meinheimer to give his speech. Hapsburg flees the dinner and takes Jane with him. After a shootout on the roof of the building, Hapsburg informs Frank that he has rigged the building with a small nuclear device which will kill everyone in there except for him and render Dr. Meinheimer's speech useless. After a fight, Frank attempts to learn the bomb's disarming code from Hapsburg, but Ed enters and throws Hapsburg out a window. Hapsburg hits an awning below and is able to come to the sidewalk unscathed, but is immediately killed by an escaped lion from the zoo.\n\nFrank and Jane attempt to disarm the bomb while Ed and Nordberg go back into the ballroom to evacuate it. After several failed attempts, Frank finally manages to disarm the bomb at the last second by tripping over its power cord, unplugging it. Frank is commended by the President, who offers him a special post as head of the Federal Bureau of Police Squad. Frank declines, instead asking Jane to marry him, which she accepts.\n\nAs with the first \"Naked Gun\" film, the original music for the second installment was composed and orchestrated by veteran soundtrack composer Ira Newborn, including the familiar big-band/blues theme for the \"Naked Gun/Police Squad!\" franchise.\n\nSeveral of the orchestral movements revolve around two other Newborn pieces: \"Drebin - Hero!\" (used at the top of the pre-credit sequence, from the Paramount-logo animation onward) and the romantic \"Thinking of Him\" (right after the credits).\n\nSeasoned Broadway and film singer/actress Colleen Fitzpatrick plays a saloon singer at a sad-sack restaurant called the Blue Note, to which a depressed Detective Lieutenant Drebin repairs after seeing former girlfriend Jane Spencer being wooed by villain Quentin Hapsburg. This role has frequently been attributed to singer Vitamin C who happens to share the same name, but this is incorrect.\n\nOther non-Newborn pieces make cameos in this \"Naked Gun\" installment. They include the standards \"Tangerine\" and \"Satin Doll\" and The Righteous Brothers' recordings of \"Unchained Melody\" (featured in Jerry Zucker's drama \"Ghost\") and \"Ebb Tide.\" Nielsen himself voices the Latin-flavored pop standard \"Bésame Mucho\" at the Press Club dinner.\n\nIn conjunction with the second \"Naked Gun\" film, Varèse Sarabande released a soundtrack combining the best Newborn compositions from the first two films.\n\n\"The Naked Gun : The Smell of Fear\" was met with mixed reviews from critics. The film currently holds a 57% \"Rotten\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10, with the critical consensus stating, \"\"Naked Gun : The Smell of Fear\" delivers a handful of moderate laughs, but overall, its strained antics pale in comparison to its gut-busting predecessor.\". Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" awarded it a B+, but observed that in some ways, it was \"the most predictable of the ZAZ films. Even the inconsistent \"Top Secret!\" (1984), a demented hybrid of Elvis movies and World War II espionage thrillers, had far wilder passages. Yet I'll take lesser ZAZ over most of the competition any day. Their comedies don't just get you laughing. They put you inside a new, cracked-mirror world — a world where no detail is too small for ridicule, and where Leslie Nielsen (bless him) can be a movie star.\" Kenneth Turan wrote in the \"Los Angeles Times\" that one should \"consider \"The Naked Gun : The Smell of Fear\". The title is funny enough, so are the credits (\"Un Film de David Zucker\"), and the key art, showing fearless Lt. Frank Drebin spread-eagled on a pair of speeding bullets, is good for a chuckle as well. But that's where the laughter ends, pal. Because the only thing about \"The Naked Gun\" that won't make you laugh is the film itself.\"\n\n\"The Naked Gun : The Smell of Fear\" knocked \"\" from the top spot at the box office. It took in $86.9 million in its 1991 domestic release ($179 million in 2015 dollars adjusted for inflation) against a reported budget of $23 million. It was the 10th best performing movie of 1991.\n\n"}
{"id": "17103032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17103032", "title": "The Testament of Cresseid", "text": "The Testament of Cresseid\n\nThe Testament of Cresseid is a narrative poem of 616 lines in Middle Scots, written by the 15th-century Scottish makar Robert Henryson. It is his best known poem. It imagines a tragic fate for Cressida in the medieval story of \"Troilus and Criseyde\" which was left untold in Geoffrey Chaucer's version. Henryson's cogent psychological drama, in which he consciously resists and confronts the routine depiction of Cressida (Cresseid) as simply 'false', is one of the features that has given the poem enduring interest for modern readers and it is one of the most admired works of northern renaissance literature. A modern English translation by Seamus Heaney, which also included seven of Henryson's fables from \"The Morall Fabillis\", was published in 2009.\n\nDiomedes, an Achaean hero with whom Cresseid begins a romantic relationship after being separated from and subsequently losing romantic interest in Troilus, banishes Cresseid from his company thereby leaving her destitute. After wandering for a while amongst the Greek soldiers, seeking their company, she returns to the home of her father Calchas, a keeper of the temple of Venus. Though Calchas welcomes her heartily, Cresseid desires to hide away from a disapproving world and encloses herself in a private oratory, where she weeps and rages against the cruelty of Venus and Cupid in, as she sees it, leading her on. The gods take offence at this blasphemy, and assemble to pass judgement on her, and the poem features graphically-realised portraits of the planetary pantheon of gods in the dream vision at its heart. They strike her with the symptoms of leprosy which remove her youth and good looks, leaving her disfigured and blind. She is thus considered a social outcast and decides she must join a leper colony. There she laments her fate until a fellow leper woman encourages her not to sigh over things which cannot be changed, but instead to take her cup and clapper and join the other lepers to beg for daily alms.\n\nAs Cresseid joins the lepers to go out begging, Troilus and the garrison of Troy happen to pass by. She lifts her eyes to his, but since she is blind she cannot recognise him. Troilus, similarly unable to recognise the disfigured Cresseid, yet being reminded of her, without quite knowing why, is spontaneously moved to give up to her all the wealth he has about him at that moment (his belt, a full purse of gold, and jewels) before riding off, almost fainting for grief when he reaches Troy. The lepers are astounded at the unexpected show of beneficence and when Cresseid asks of her benefactor's identity and is told, she, like Troilus, too is overcome with emotion. She berates herself for her treatment of him and renounces her previously 'selfish' complaints, before sitting down to write her testament, or will, dying soon after.\n\nHenryson's portrayal of Cresseid's 'disgrace' and ultimately tragic end, through the narrator of the poem, is observed with a largely rigorous objectivity. Where the narrator comes to judge, rather than reinforcing the institutional admonishment of a 'shocked' or disapproving society, he 'confesses' to his natural pity for Cresseid's misfortune, against the standard view of 'false womanhood' which she was taken in his day to represent. This is perhaps all the more expressive for having been apparently withheld or 'repressed' within the conceit of the poem. The most explicit statement of this breaks through in the passage:\n\n<poem>\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "256204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=256204", "title": "Whistle register", "text": "Whistle register\n\nThe whistle register (also called the flute register or whistle tone) is the highest register of the human voice, lying above the modal register and falsetto register. This register has a specific physiological production that is different from the other registers, and is so called because the timbre of the notes that are produced from this register is similar to that of a whistle.\n\nIn some sopranos, the modal register vocal production may extend into what is usually thought of as the whistle register. With proper vocal training, it is possible for men and women within all voice types to develop this part of the voice. However, some people find it difficult or uncomfortable to sing in this register, therefore, it may take them more time to gain control of it.\n\nThe whistle register is the highest phonational register, that in most singers begins above the soprano \"high C\" (C or 1,046.5 Hz) and usually extends to about two Ds above (D or 2349.3 Hz). It is created by using only the back of the vocal folds. The lower part of the whistle register may overlap the upper parts of the modal and falsetto registers, making it possible for singers to phonate these notes in different ways. However, fundamentally the whistle register is most commonly used to produce pitches above C. As with the other vocal registers, the whistle register does not begin at the same point within every voice, and there are rare voices which can extend the whistle register much higher or lower than the range listed above. For example, most operatic coloratura sopranos can sing up to the \"high\" F above \"high\" C without entering into the whistle register. Cleo Laine of UK and Yma Sumac of Peru are two sopranos with extreme vocal ranges.\n\nThe physiology of the whistle register is the least understood of the vocal registers. Unlike other types of vocal production, it is difficult to film the vocal cords while they are operating in this manner as the epiglottis closes down over the larynx and the resonating chamber assumes its smallest dimensions. It is known that when producing pitches in this register, vibration occurs only in some anterior portion of the vocal folds. This shorter vibrating length naturally allows for easier production of high pitches.\n\nAlthough the whole physiological production of whistle tone is not understood, it is known that when the laterals are active but the transversus inactive, a triangular opening is seen between the arytenoids, the vocal processes contact each other, but the posterior parts at the apex do not contact each other. The exception to this would be if the vocal folds are not stretched, as stretching of the vocal ligaments abducts (moves away from) the vocal processes.\n\nMany babies and small children regardless of sex can produce sounds in the frequency range of the whistle register without any conscious effort. Typically, the whistle register in children extends from the soprano \"high C\" (C or 1046.5 Hz) to two Gs above (G or 3136 Hz). Some children, however, can produce pitches that surpass the upper limit of the keyboard.\n\nIn European classical music, the whistle register is used primarily by coloratura sopranos. Many parts in the coloratura soprano repertoire extend beyond \"high C\" and often extend up to high F (F or 1396.9 Hz). Although many coloratura sopranos use whistle tone vocal production to sing these notes, some operatic sopranos are capable of singing up to \"high F\" without utilizing the vocal production associated with the whistle register but remaining in the modal register. However, most coloratura sopranos do utilize the whistle register, particularly when singing staccato notes in rapid succession, during high trills, or other elaborate coloratura ornamentation in the upper tessitura. Rarely will coloraturas use whistle tone when doing high extended notes. However, singers like Mado Robin were noted for doing so. \n\nIn Western popular music, the whistle register is used with more variety and to produce much higher pitches than are called for in classical music. It is mostly used by female singers, such as Mariah Carey, Minnie Riperton, Christina Aguilera, Ariana Grande, Tori Kelly, Normani and Morissette Amon, although some men can make use of the whistle register, too, like Dimash Kudaibergen or Adam Lopez. Wang Xiaolong holds the \"Guinness Book of Records\" title for the highest vocal note produced by a man (E, 5243 Hz). Female singer Georgia Brown was listed in the 2005 Guinness World Records for highest note (G or 25 kHz) ever reached, but this claim was removed when the 2007 edition was issued.\n\n\n"}
