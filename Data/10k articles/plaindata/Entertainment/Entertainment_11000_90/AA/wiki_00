The gameplay is similar — the player pilots a 'skimmer' through a 3D world — but with many extra features. Instead of a single, large gameworld, the storyline is mission-based (but allowing the player some control over the order of play). The world physics of the original game are expanded on, as these missions take place on different planets under different suns; for example piloting under a dark red-dwarf provides a different play experience to a bright yellow sun.\n\nIn addition, the player may design their own skimmers; customising engine and weapon strengths, equipment payloads, and arranging the on-screen control panel.\n\nThe game's interface is the same distinctive cursor-and-menu system used in Pete Cooke's other creations, such as \"Micronaut One\", \"A Whole New Ball Game\" and \"Tau Ceti\".\n\nFrom the game's instructions:\nAfter an incident on 61 Cygnus in 2197 when a rookie pilot selected the wrong gear when docking with the main central reactor and reduced half the planet to molten lava, Gal-Corp decided that a special training facility was needed to provide an elite corps of pilots for the advanced military skimmers used in colonisation and reconnaissance work.\n\nThe Galcorp Academy for Advanced Skimmer Pilots (GASP) was founded in 2213 to meet this requirement.

It is named after the song by Fats Waller (with Harry Brooks and Andy Razaf), \"Ain't Misbehavin'\".\n\nThe musical is a tribute to the black musicians of the 1920s and 1930s who were part of the Harlem Renaissance, an era of growing creativity, cultural awareness, and ethnic pride, and takes its title from the 1929 Waller song \"Ain't Misbehavin'\". It was a time when Manhattan nightclubs like the Cotton Club and the Savoy Ballroom were the playgrounds of high society and Lenox Avenue dives were filled with piano players banging out the new beat known as swing. Five performers present an evening of rowdy, raunchy, and humorous songs that encapsulate the various moods of the era and reflect Waller's view of life as a journey meant for pleasure and play.\n\n\"Ain't Misbehavin\"' opened in the Manhattan Theatre Club's East 73rd Street cabaret on February 8, 1978. The cast included Irene Cara, Nell Carter, André DeShields, Armelia McQueen, and Ken Page and was staged by Arthur Faria, now recognized as one of the original authors, and directed by Maltby. \"The New York Times\" reviewer wrote: \"The show moves with the zing and sparkle of a Waller recording-filled with bright melodies and asides.\" Its reception was such that it was decided to develop it into a full-scale production.\n\nThe musical opened on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre on May 9, 1978, and transferred to the Plymouth Theatre and then to the Belasco Theatre and closed on February 21, 1982, after 1604 performances and fourteen previews. Maltby was the director, with musical staging and choreography by Arthur Faria. The original cast featured Nell Carter, André DeShields, Armelia McQueen, Ken Page, and Charlayne Woodard. Luther Henderson, who adapted Waller's music for the revue, appeared as the production's original pianist. Replacements later in the run included Debbie Allen, Yvette Freeman, Adriane Lenox, and Alan Weeks. An original cast recording was released by RCA Victor.\n\nThe West End production opened on March 22, 1979, at Her Majesty's Theatre. DeShields and Woodard were joined by Evan Bell, Annie Joe Edwards, and Jozella Reed. It was revived in London in 1995 at the Tricycle Theatre and then the Lyric Theatre, with Debby Bishop, Dawn Hope, Melanie Marshall, Sean Palmer, and Ray Shell. A London revival cast recording was released by First Night.\n\nOn June 12, 1982, NBC broadcast the revue with the original Broadway cast.\n\nA Broadway revival with the same director, choreographer, and cast as the original 1978 production opened on August 15, 1988, at the Ambassador Theatre, where it ran for 176 performances and eight previews. Frank Rich, in his review for \"The New York Times\", wrote \"In their scrupulous re-creation of the Fats Waller show that first electrified Broadway a decade ago, the original cast and creators have conjured the same between-the-wars dream world as before... Though almost bereft of dialogue, this musical anthology expands beyond its form to become a resurrection of a great black artist's soul. Perhaps the key to the musical's approach, as conceived by the director Richard Maltby Jr., is its willingness to let Waller speak simply and eloquently for himself, through his art but without show-biz embroidery.\"\n\nIn 1995, a national tour directed and choreographed by Faria starred the Pointer Sisters, Eugene Barry-Hill, and Michael-Leon Wooley. Although it never reached Broadway as originally planned, a recording of highlights from the show was released by RCA.\n\nBeginning in November 2008 and lasting until at least May 2009, season two \"American Idol\" contestants Frenchie Davis, Trenyce Cobbins and winner Ruben Studdard starred in the 30th anniversary national tour of the show.

It was built in Toronto by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The four meter tall computer allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of tic-tac-toe against an artificial intelligence. The player entered a move on a lit keypad in the form of a three-by-three grid, and the game played out on a grid of lights overhead. The machine had an adjustable difficulty level. After two weeks on display by Rogers Majestic, the machine was disassembled at the end of the exhibition and largely forgotten as a curiosity.\n\nKates built the game to showcase his additron tube, a miniature version of the vacuum tube, though the transistor overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used in computers besides \"Bertie\" before it was no longer useful. \"Bertie the Brain\" is a candidate for the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer game to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only three years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display. \"Bertie\"s use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.\n\n\"Bertie the Brain\" was a computer game of tic-tac-toe, built by Dr. Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. Kates had previously worked at Rogers Majestic designing and building radar tubes during World War II, then after the war pursued graduate studies in the computing center at the University of Toronto while continuing to work at Rogers Majestic. While there, he helped build the University of Toronto Electronic Computer (UTEC), one of the first working computers in the world. He also designed his own miniature version of the vacuum tube, called the additron tube, which he registered with the Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers' Association on 20 March 1951 as type 6047.\n\nAfter filing for a patent for the additron tube, Rogers Majestic pushed Kates to create a device to showcase the tube to potential buyers. Kates designed a specialized computer incorporating the technology and built it with the assistance of engineers from Rogers Majestic. The large, four meter tall metal computer could only play tic-tac-toe and was installed in the Engineering Building at the Canadian National Exhibition from 25 August–9 September 1950.\n\nThe additron-based computer, labeled as \"Bertie the Brain\" and subtitled \"The Electronic Wonder by Rogers Majestic\", was a success at the two-week exhibition, with attendees lining up to play it. Kates stayed by the machine when possible, adjusting the difficulty up or down for adults and children. Comedian Danny Kaye was photographed defeating the machine (after several attempts) for \"Life\" magazine.\n\n\"Bertie the Brain\" was a game of tic-tac-toe in which the player would select the position for their next move from a grid of nine lit buttons on a raised panel. The moves would appear on a grid of nine large squares set vertically on the machine as well as on the buttons, with either an X- or O-shaped light turning on in the corresponding space. The computer would make its move shortly after. A pair of signs to the right of the playfield, alternately lit up with \"Electronic Brain\" and an X or \"Human Brain\" and an O, marked which player's turn it was, and would light up along with \"Win\" when a player had won. \"Bertie\" could be set to several difficulty levels. The computer responded almost instantly to the player's moves and at the highest difficulty level was almost unbeatable.\n\nAfter the exhibition, \"Bertie\" was dismantled and \"largely forgotten\" as a novelty. Kates has said that he was working on so many projects at the same time that he had no energy to spare for preserving it, despite its significance. Despite being the first implemented computer game—preceded only by theorized chess programs—and featured in a \"Life\" magazine article, the game was largely forgotten, even by video game history books. \"Bertie\"'s primary purpose, to promote the additron tube, went unfulfilled, as it was the only completed application of the technology. By the time Rogers Majestic pushed Kates to develop a working model for the Exhibition, he had been working on the tubes for a year, developing several revisions, and the University of Toronto team felt that the development was too slow to attempt to integrate them into the UTEC.\n\nAlthough other firms expressed interest to Kates and Rogers Majestic in using the tubes, issues with acquiring patents prevented him, Rogers Majestic, or the University of Toronto from patenting the tubes anywhere outside Canada until 1955, and the patent application was not accepted in the United States until March 1957, six years after filing. By then, research and use of vacuum tubes was heavily waning in the face of the rise of the superior transistor, preventing any re-visitation of \"Bertie\" or similar machines. Kates went on to a distinguished career in Canadian engineering, but did not return to working on vacuum tubes or computer games.\n\n\"Bertie\" was created only three years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, and while non-visual games had been developed for research computers such as Alan Turing and Dietrich Prinz's chess program for the Ferranti Mark 1 at the University of Manchester, \"Bertie\" was the first computer-based game to feature a visual display of any sort. \"Bertie\" is considered under some definitions in contention for the title of the first video game. While definitions vary, the prior cathode-ray tube amusement device was a purely analog electrical game, and while \"Bertie\" did not feature an electronic screen it did run on a computer. Another special-purpose computer-based game, \"Nimrod\", was built in 1951, while the software-based tic-tac-toe game \"OXO\" and a draughts program by Christopher Strachey were in 1952 the first computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen rather than light bulbs.\n"}
{"id": "42174514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42174514", "title": "Bug bounty program", "text": "Bug bounty program\n\nA bug bounty program is a deal offered by many websites and software developers by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to exploits and vulnerabilities. These programs allow the developers to discover and resolve bugs before the general public is aware of them, preventing incidents of widespread abuse. Bug bounty programs have been implemented by a large numbers of organizations, including Mozilla, Facebook, Yahoo!, Google, Reddit, Square, and Microsoft. Companies outside the technology industry, including traditionally conservative organizations like the United States Department of Defense, have started using bug bounty programs. The Pentagon’s use of bug bounty programs is part of a posture shift that has seen several US Government Agencies reverse course from threatening White hat (computer security) hackers with legal recourse to inviting them to participate as part of a comprehensive vulnerability disclosure framework or policy. \n\nHunter & Ready initiated the first known bug bounty program in 1983 for their Versatile Real-Time Executive operating system. Anyone who found and reported a bug would receive a Volkswagen Beetle (aka Bug) in return. A little over a decade later in 1995, Jarrett Ridlinghafer, a technical support engineer at Netscape Communications Corporation coined the phrase 'Bugs Bounty'.\n\nNetscape encouraged its employees to push themselves and do whatever it takes to get the job done. Ridlinghafer recognized that Netscape had many enthusiasts and evangelists for their products, some of whom to him seemed even fanatical, particularly for the Mosaic/Netscape/Mozilla browser. He started to investigate the phenomenon in more detail and discovered that many of Netscape's enthusiasts were actually software engineers who were fixing the product's bugs on their own and publishing the fixes or workarounds:\n\nRidlinghafer thought the company should leverage these resources and sat down and wrote out a proposal for the 'Netscape Bugs Bounty Program', which he presented to his manager who in turn suggested that Ridlinghafer present it at the next company executive team meeting.\n\nAt the next executive team meeting, which was attended by James Barksdale, Marc Andreessen and the VPs of every department including product engineering, each member was given a copy of the 'Netscape Bugs Bounty Program' proposal and Ridlinghafer was invited to present his idea to the Netscape Executive Team.\n\nEveryone at the meeting embraced the idea except the VP of Engineering, who did not want it to go forward believing it to be a waste of time and resources. However, the VP of Engineering was overruled and Ridlinghafer was given an initial $50k budget to run with the proposal and the first official 'Bugs Bounty' program was launched in 1995.\n\nThe program was such a huge success it's mentioned in many of the books detailing Netscape's successes.\n\nIn August 2013, a Computer Science student named Khalil used an exploit to post a letter on the Facebook timeline of site founder Mark Zuckerberg. According to the hacker, he had tried to report the vulnerability using Facebook's bug bounty program, but because of the vague and incomplete report the response team told him that his vulnerability was not actually a bug.\n\nFacebook started paying researchers who find and report security bugs by issuing them custom branded “White Hat” debit cards that can be reloaded with funds each time the researchers discover new flaws. “Researchers who find bugs and security improvements are rare, and we value them and have to find ways to reward them,” Ryan McGeehan, former manager of Facebook’s security response team, told CNET in an interview. “Having this exclusive black card is another way to recognize them. They can show up at a conference and show this card and say ‘I did special work for Facebook.’” In 2014, Facebook stopped issuing debit cards to researchers.\n\nIn 2016, ride sharing company Uber experienced a security incident when an individual accessed the personal information of 57 million Uber users worldwide. The individual supposedly demanded a ransom of $100,000 in order to destroy the users’ data. In Congressional testimony, Uber CISO indicated that the company verified that the data had been destroyed before paying the $100,000. Mr. Flynn expressed regret that Uber did not disclose the incident in 2016. As part of their response to this incident, Uber worked with partner HackerOne to update their bug bounty program policies to, among other things, more thoroughly explain good faith vulnerability research and disclosure. \n\nIndia, which has either the first or second largest number of bug hunters in the world, depending on which report one cites, also tops the Facebook Bug Bounty Program with the largest number of valid bugs. “India came out on top with the number of valid submissions in 2017, with the United States and Trinidad & Tobago in second and third place, respectively”, Facebook quoted in a post. \n\nYahoo! was severely criticized for sending out Yahoo! T-shirts as reward to the Security Researchers for finding and reporting security vulnerabilities in Yahoo!, sparking what came to be called \"T-shirt-gate\". High-Tech Bridge, a Geneva, Switzerland-based security testing company issued a press release saying Yahoo! offered $12.50 in credit per vulnerability, which could be used toward Yahoo-branded items such as T-shirts, cups and pens from its store. Ramses Martinez, director of Yahoo's security team claimed later in a blog post that he was behind the voucher reward program, and that he basically had been paying for them out of his own pocket. Eventually, Yahoo! launched its new bug bounty program on October 31 of the same year, that allows security researchers to submit bugs and receive rewards between $250 and $15,000, depending on the severity of the bug discovered.\n\nIn October 2013, Google announced a major change to its Vulnerability Reward Program. Previously, it had been a bug bounty program covering many Google products. With the shift, however, the program was broadened to include a selection of high-risk free software applications and libraries, primarily those designed for networking or for low-level operating system functionality. Submissions that Google found adherent to the guidelines would be eligible for rewards ranging from $500 to $3133.70. In 2017, Google expanded their program to cover vulnerabilities found in applications developed by third parties and made available through the Google Play Store.\n\nSimilarly, Microsoft and Facebook partnered in November 2013 to sponsor The Internet Bug Bounty, a program to offer rewards for reporting hacks and exploits for a broad range of Internet-related software. In 2017, GitHub and The Ford Foundation sponsored the initiative, which is managed by volunteers from Uber, Microsoft, Facebook, Adobe, and HackerOne. The software covered by the IBB includes Adobe Flash, Python, Ruby, PHP, Django, Ruby on Rails, Perl, OpenSSL, Nginx, Apache HTTP Server, and Phabricator. In addition, the program offered rewards for broader exploits affecting widely used operating systems and web browsers, as well as the Internet as a whole.\n\nIn March 2016, Peter Cook announced the US federal government's first bug bounty program, the \"Hack the Pentagon\" program. The program ran from April 18 to May 12 and over 1400 people submitted 138 unique valid reports through HackerOne. In total, the US Department of Defense paid out $71,200. In June, the Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, met with two participants, David Dworken and Craig Arendt, to honor them for their participation in the program.\n\n\"Open Bug Bounty\" is a crowd security bug bounty program established in 2014 that allows individuals to post website security vulnerabilities in the hope of a reward from affected website operators.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "678337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=678337", "title": "Chinatown, Vancouver", "text": "Chinatown, Vancouver\n\nChinatown in Vancouver, British Columbia, is Canada's largest Chinatown. Centred on Pender Street, it is surrounded by Gastown and the Downtown financial and central business districts to the west, the Downtown Eastside to the north, the remnant of old Japantown to the northeast, and the residential neighbourhood of Strathcona to the east. The approximate borders of Chinatown as designated by the City of Vancouver are the alley between Pender and Hastings Streets, Georgia Street, Gore Avenue, and Taylor Street, although unofficially the area extends well into the rest of the Downtown Eastside. Main, Pender, and Keefer Streets are the principal areas of commercial activity.\n\nChinatown remains a popular tourist attraction and is one of the largest historic Chinatowns in North America. However, it experienced decline as newer members of Vancouver's Cantonese Chinese community dispersed to other parts of the metropolitan area. It has been more recently overshadowed by the newer Chinese immigrant business district along No. 3 Road in the City of Richmond, south of Vancouver. Many affluent Hong Kong and Taiwanese immigrants have moved there since the late 1980s, coinciding with the increase of Chinese ethnic retail and restaurants in that area. This new area is designated the \"Golden Village\" by the City of Richmond. The proposed renaming of the area to \"Chinatown\" met resistance both from merchants in Vancouver's Chinatown and from non-Chinese residents and merchants in Richmond itself.\n\nChinatown was once known for its neon signs, but like the rest of the city, lost many signs to changing times and a sign bylaw passed in 1974. The last of these was the Ho Ho sign (which showed a rice bowl and chop sticks), which was removed in 1997. Ongoing efforts at revitalization include efforts by the business community to improve safety by hiring private security, considering new marketing promotions, and introducing residential units into the neighbourhood by restoring and renovating heritage buildings. The current focus is on the restoration and adaptive reuse of the distinctive association buildings.\n\nDue to the large ethnic Chinese presence in Vancouver—especially represented by multi-generation Chinese Canadians and first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong—the city has been referred to as \"Hongcouver\".\n\nChinatown is becoming more prosperous as new investment and old traditional businesses flourish. Today the neighbourhood features many traditional restaurants, banks, markets, clinics, tea shops, clothing stores, and other shops catering to the local community and tourists alike. The Vancouver office of \"Sing Tao Daily\", one of the city's four Chinese-language dailies, remains in Chinatown. OMNI British Columbia (formerly Channel M) had its television studio in Chinatown from 2003 to 2010.\n\nVancouver experienced large numbers of immigrants from the Asia-Pacific region in the last two decades of the twentieth century, most notably from China, whose population in the Vancouver Census Metropolitan Area was estimated at 300,000 in the mid-1990s. A significant development since the 1980s has been the increase of transnational awareness among the Chinese. The heightened mobility of capital, information, people, and commodities across territorial boundaries and distance challenged the traditional meaning of migration. Compared to Chinatown itself, more Chinese immigrants have settled in Richmond, drawn by its lower house prices, considerable concentration of Chinese retailers, and the nearby Vancouver airport. The business heart of Chinatown was visibly affected after the arrival of suburban Asian shopping districts, such as Richmond's Aberdeen Centre, which was promoted as North America's largest enclosed Asian mall in the proximity of other Chinese shopping centres, and which offered more parking and open space than historic Chinatown.\n\nIn 1979, the Chinatown Historic Area Planning Committee sponsored a streetscape improvement program to add various Chinese-style elements to the area, such as specially paved sidewalks and red dragon streetlamps that demarcated the area's borders while emphasizing it as a destination for heritage tourism. Starting with its designation by the province as a historic area in 1971 and subsequent economic shifts, Chinatown shifted from a central business district to playing a largely cultural role. Murality, a local non-profit, is installing a mural on East Pender Street with the aim of bringing colour and vitality to the neighbourhood.\n\nThe growth of Chinatown during much of the 20th century created a healthy, robust community that gradually became an aging one as many Chinese immigrants no longer lived nearby. Noticing local businesses suffering, the Chinatown Merchants Association cited the lack of parking and restrictive heritage district rules as impediments to new uses and renovations. Their concerns subsequently led to a relaxation of zoning laws to allow for a wider range of uses, including necessary demolition. Additions in the mid-1990s included a large parkade, a shopping mall, and the largest Chinese restaurant in Canada. More residential projects around the community and a lowering of property taxes helped to maintain a more rounded community. Reinvigoration was a discussed topic along government members, symbolically embedded in the Millennium Gate project, which opened in 2002. It can be argued that the role of the early Chinese settlers in Vancouver's Chinatown area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries helped to put Vancouver on the global map as a popular destination for Asian investment and immigration.\n\nChinatown's businesses today predominantly consist of those selling lower-order, working-class goods, such as groceries, tea shops, and souvenir stores. While some businesses, such as restaurants, stand out, they are no longer the only Chinese food establishments in the city, a shift that contributed to a visible decline in foot traffic and nighttime activity in Chinatown. As the vacancy rate in Chinatown currently stands at 10%, it has been acknowledged that Chinatown needs a new approach to development, since some businesses have relocated to suburban shopping centres while others simply retired or went out of business. Examples include the closing of some restaurants and shops, sometimes in instances where the family did not have successors or where the business could not sustain itself any longer. Although there is a considerable business vacancy, Chinatown lease rates are considered the cheapest in the city, at $15–$30 per square foot—about one-tenth of the asking price on Vancouver's Downtown Robson Street, the city's upscale shopping district.\n\nThe new Chinatown business plan encourages new entrepreneurs to move in—and has attracted a longboard store and German sausage shop—as ways of restoring storefronts and bringing in a younger crowd, and to make higher-income people more comfortable in the area. Attracted to the lower rent and the building's heritage status, younger businesses have moved in, often with white owners who also live in apartments above the shops. The general consensus is that Chinatown's priority is to attract people of all backgrounds to Chinatown, and it is believed that the opening of non-traditional stores will bring a new flow of energy and income to the streets. As a result, the commercial activity is becoming more diversified, dotted with Western chain stores such as Waves Coffeeshop and Dollar Giant. Other additions include vintage stores, two art galleries, bars, and a nightclub, built on the site of the former Ming's restaurant, in an attempt to bring something of a nightlife atmosphere, reminiscent of the 1950s and 1960s, back to the neighbourhood. The diversity of new shops and businesses is believed to be necessary in creating a new image for Chinatown in order to bring vibrancy back to the area and encourage commercial activities in general, and as a way to compete with suburban districts as well as nearby Gastown and Downtown Vancouver.\n\nThe Chinatown Historic Area planning committee, along with AECOM Economics, a US-based planning firm, helped to prepare a Chinatown Revitalization Action Plan for Vancouver's planning department in November 2011. Vancouver planners surveyed 77 businesses and found that 64% reported a decrease in revenue between 2008 and 2011. The majority of consumers, 58%, were local residents, with 21% coming from elsewhere in the Lower Mainland. Tourist spending accounted for only 12% of Chinatown customers. Recognizing the shifting role of Chinatown, the report highlighted key points to help the district keep up with the times:\n\n\nBuilding on these points, the report recommended that Chinatown needs:\n\nVancouver city councillors voted in 2011 to raise building height restrictions in Chinatown in order to boost its population density. A limit of 9 stories for most of the neighbourhood was set, with a maximum of 15 stories on the busiest streets. Highrises close to Stadium-Chinatown Station have already been built, with more condominium towers under construction, some projects taking advantage of empty lots that sat unused for decades. Due to the unconventional lot sizes, one 9-storey condominium is only 25 feet wide. However, that is not expected to be a problem in Vancouver, which has a market for affordable smaller-scale homes. Critics of highrise development speculate that the plan will effectively divide up the neighbourhood to form a \"Great Wall of Chinatown\" as lower-income residents are marginalized and displaced.\n\n\n\nIn recent years Chinatown has seen growth in new construction as a downtown building boom continued into the former Expo 86 lands, which adjoin Chinatown. New high-rise towers are being constructed around the old Expo 86 site, including International Village, which was built in 1998 and is located next to Stadium–Chinatown SkyTrain station. Anchored by Cineplex Odeon International Village Cinemas and flanked by Rexall Drugstore and Yokoyaya 123, the International Village Shopping Centre is a 300,000 ft² entertainment and shopping venue. It is one of the first master-planned communities in Greater Vancouver; is the central hub connecting Gastown, Chinatown, and Yaletown; and is adjacent to the Rogers Arena, the Plaza of Nations, and BC Place Stadium.\n\nInternational Village was designed to be downtown's answer to the Asian malls found in the Golden Village, though it is not as racially exclusive and includes businesses and residents that are non-Chinese.\n\nInternational Village also refers to the name given to the area by developer Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd., a subsidiary of Henderson Land Development.\n\nInternational Village was commonly called Tinseltown, based on one of the brands of theatre chain Cinemark Theatres, which owned the building before Cineplex did.\n\nChinese immigrants, primarily men, first came to Vancouver in the late 19th century. As more people of Chinese heritage came to Vancouver, clan associations were formed to help the newcomers assimilate in their adopted homeland and to provide friendship and support. Clan societies were often formed around a shared surname lineage, county (e.g., Kaiping, Zhongshan), or other feature of identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46773216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46773216", "title": "Crossout", "text": "Crossout\n\nCrossout is a Russian post-apocalyptic MMO-action game for PC and consoles. Described as a crafting and combat MMO, the game allows players to construct their own post-apocalyptic vehicles to be used in PvP engagements with real players and PvE missions involving AI-participants. The game is developed by Targem Games and is published by Gaijin Entertainment.\n\nOn May 20, 2015, both Gaijin Entertainment and Targem Games announced the development of a new free-to-play mmo set in a post-apocalyptic future. The first alpha tests of the game, called 'Battle Test', were launched in summer 2015. and in the same year, the game made its debut on the E3 2015. Later in the same year, the game was playable in a closed area at Gaijin Entertainment's booth at Gamescom 2015, where players got a promo code to participate in further testing. On April 5, 2016, Crossout went into closed beta and was launched into open beta on May 30, 2017, on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\n\nEvents of Crossout take place in the same universe as Ex Machina’s (aka Hard Truck: Apocalypse in the North American market), which is also a Targem-created game published by Buka in 2005. Crossout aims to depict life on Earth 20 years after the disaster, and 200 years before Ex Machina.\n\nIn the year 2027 the planet was swept over with a mysterious pandemic disease, that started to spread simultaneously all over the planet. Those few who survived the first days were then haunted by hallucinations, headaches and nightmares, most chose to end their lives. Neither the source of the disease, called “Crossout” by the media, nor the nature of the pathogen were identified. The planet was overthrown with chaos as the population fled the larger cities, leaving them as graveyards. In just a few dreadful months, civilization was no more.\n\nThe reason behind this was the disruption of an extraterrestrial, multi-millennia eugenic experiment aimed at developing a new sentient race on Earth. Due to a mishap with the control systems the “rally signal” in the DNA was engaged a few centuries earlier than planned and originally dormant experimental genes were activated which made entities combat-ready. The DNA of the inhabitants, however, hadn’t fully developed, and thus the planet was filled with lunatics and suicidal maniacs instead of super soldiers as was originally planned, these mutants survived, and despite their human appearance they couldn’t technically be called humans. Survivors have changed mentally, and a decade later visible transformations were reported. The most notable changes involved the blackening of the eyeballs or a strange luminescence in them. Keen to cover up their new appearance, these individuals would hide their eyes and faces under clothing and sunglasses.\n\nTwo decades have passed since “Crossout”, many do remember what was before. As always there are those willing to rebuild the old world and those that revel in the vision of a burning ruin. Yet there are also those devoid of any humanity at all, but one thing is for sure, this battle will rage on for a long time.\n\nThe gameplay is announced to be focused around the creation and subsequent upgrade of the player's vehicle through combat and trade as well as the crafting of new items. Currently, the game depicts a post-apocalyptic setting after a \"Nuclear war\" and \"human genetic testing gone awry\", showing some resemblance to the Mad Max universe.\n\nThe game focuses around vehicle combat. Players gain reputation with different factions, gaining access to new blueprints, parts, cars. Players gather parts and materials via battle rewards, completing missions, breaking down unneeded equipment, or by purchasing items from other players via an in-game market. Each player's combat vehicle is only limited by the player's imagination and 2 mandatory parts that need to be integrated into each player's design: cabin and undercarriage (frame). Parts such as armor, weaponry, generators, and auxiliary devices are not required. Different combinations of these items let players custom tune vehicles to their own liking and playstyle. As there are no fixed traditional vehicle \"classes\" or vehicle roles, players are free to edit and modify their vehicle as they feel, allowing players to customize both the look and the technical aspects of their vehicle, honing their machine’s performance and looks to their liking.\n\nAlong with vehicle crafting and customization, Crossout implements a physics model. Players must take into consideration the center of gravity, mass, location and placement of parts. A vehicle too top-heavy may roll over if turned too quickly or during movement on uneven terrain. Heavy machinery has more difficulty navigating. Equipment (such as a rotating radar dish) placed too close to the ground may be hit during its movement causing loss of control or degraded movement ability. Large caliber cannons present recoil on both ends of the weapon, being able to flip over a lighter vehicle that fired the projectile, and potentially flipping the player who is hit. This mechanic not only gives players more in-depth customization, but also acts as a self-balancing aspect. Players who just load down a vehicle with heavy armor and large caliber weapons would not be able to function in combat.\n\nThese battles are real-time and involve two teams of players and AI-participants. To win, a team must eliminate the enemy team, capture base or perform other tasks depending on the game mode.\n\nAny vehicle is “active” until the cabin is destroyed, before that it may lose other parts including armor, wheels and armament, effectively crippling or neutralizing it. Because of that, it is important to protect vital components on the battle wagon. Some parts, such as generators or fuel barrels, will explode upon destruction dealing damage to the components/vehicles around it.\n\nMatchmaking is currently limited only by the parts used to create the players' vehicles. Armor costs very few points, while guns and cannons cost much more, meaning that players will be matched with relatively equal-tiered vehicles. Because of this, a vehicle's points come mostly from the weapons it uses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMMORPG.com called Crossout “The most innovative game at E3 2015”.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2090445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090445", "title": "Cypria", "text": "Cypria\n\nThe Cypria ( \"Kúpria\"; Latin: \"Cypria\") is a lost epic poem of ancient Greek literature, which has been attributed to Stasinus and was quite well known in classical antiquity and fixed in a received text, but which subsequently was lost to view. It was part of the Epic Cycle, which told the entire history of the Trojan War in epic hexameter verse. The story of the \"Cypria\" comes chronologically at the beginning of the Epic Cycle, and is followed by that of the \"Iliad\"; the composition of the two was apparently in the reverse order. The poem comprised eleven books of verse in epic dactylic hexameters.\n\nThe \"Cypria\", in the written form in which it was known in classical Greece, was probably composed in the late seventh century BC, but there is much uncertainty. The Cyclic Poets, as the translator of Homerica, Hugh G. Evelyn-White noted \"were careful not to trespass upon ground already occupied by Homer,\" one of the reasons for dating the final, literary form of \"Cypria\" as post-Homeric, in effect a \"prequel\". \"The author of the \"Kypria\" already regarded the \"Iliad\" as a text. Any reading of the \"Kypria\" will show it preparing for events for (specifically) the \"Iliad\" in order to refer back to them, for instance the sale of Lykaon to Lemnos or the kitting out of Achilles with Briseis and Agamemnon with Chryseis\". A comparison can be made with the \"Aethiopis\", also lost, but which even in its quoted fragments is more independent of the \"Iliad\" as text.\n\nThe stories contained in the \"Cypria\", on the other hand, were fixed much earlier than that, and the same problems of dating oral traditions associated with the Homeric epics also apply to the \"Cypria\". Many or all of the stories in the \"Cypria\" were known to the composer(s) of the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\". The \"Cypria\", in presupposing an acquaintance with the events of the Homeric poem, in the received view thus formed a kind of introduction to the \"Iliad\" though there is an overlap in events from the death of Palamedes, including the catalogue of Trojan allies. J. Marks observes that \"Indeed, the junction would be seamless if the \"Kypria\" simply ended with the death of Palamedes.\"\n\nThe title \"Cypria\", associating the epic with Cyprus, demanded some explanation: the epic was said in one ancient tradition to have been given by Homer as a dowry to his son-in-law, a Stasinus of Cyprus mentioned in no other context; there was apparently an allusion to this in a lost Nemean ode by Pindar. Some later writers repeated the story. It did at least serve to explain why the \"Cypria\" was attributed by some to Homer and by others to Stasinus. Others, however, ascribed the poem to Hegesias (or Hegesinus) of Salamis in Cyprus or to Cyprias of Halicarnassus (see Cyclic Poets).\n\nIt is possible that the \"Trojan Battle Order\" (the list of Trojans and their allies, of \"Iliad\" 2.816-876, which forms an appendix to the \"Catalogue of Ships\") is abridged from that in the \"Cypria\", which was known to contain in its final book a list of the Trojan allies.\n\nIn current critical editions only about fifty lines survive of the \"Cypria\"'s original text, quoted by others. For the content we are almost entirely dependent on a prose summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the \"Chrestomathy\" attributed to an unknown \"Proclus\" (possibly to be identified with the 2nd-century AD grammarian Eutychius Proclus, or else with an otherwise unknown 5th-century grammarian). Many other passing references give further minor indications of the poem's storyline.\n\nWhat follows embeds reports of known content of the \"Cypria\" in a retelling of the known events leading up to the anger of Achilles.\n\nThe poem narrates the origins of the Trojan War and its first events. It begins with the decision of Zeus to relieve the Earth of the burden of population through war, a decision with familiar Mesopotamian parallels. The Theban war of the Seven ensues.\n\nThe \"Cypria\" described the wedding of Peleus and Thetis; in the Judgement of Paris among the goddesses Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite: Paris awards the prize for beauty to Aphrodite, and as a prize is awarded Helen, wife of Menelaus.\n\nThen Paris builds his ships at Aphrodite's suggestion, and Helenus foretells the future to him, and Aphrodite orders Aeneas to sail with him, while Cassandra prophesies the outcome. In Lacedaemon the Trojans are entertained by the sons of Tyndareus, Castor and Polydeuces, and by Menelaus, who then sets sail for Crete, ordering Helen to furnish the guests with all they require. Aphrodite brings Helen and Paris together, and he takes her and her dowry back to his home of Troy with an episode at Sidon, which Paris and his men successfully storm.\n\nIn the meantime Castor and Polydeuces, while stealing the cattle of Idas and Lynceus, are caught and killed: Zeus gives them immortality that they share every other day.\n\nIris informs Menelaus, who returns to plan an expedition against Ilium with his brother Agamemnon. They set out to assemble the former suitors of Helen, who had sworn an oath to defend the rights of whichever one won her hand. Nestor in a digression tells Menelaus how Epopeus was destroyed after seducing the daughter of Lycus, the story of Oedipus, the madness of Heracles, and the story of Theseus and Ariadne. In gathering the leaders, they detect Odysseus' feigned madness.\n\nThe assembled leaders offer ill-omened sacrifice at Aulis, where the prophet Calchas warns the Greeks that the war will last ten years. They reach the city of Teuthras in Mysia and sack it in error for Ilium: Telephus comes to the city's rescue and is wounded by Achilles. The fleet scattered by storm, Achilles puts in at Skyros and marries Deidameia, the daughter of Lycomedes, then heals Telephus, so that he might be their guide to Ilium.\n\nWhen the Achaeans have been mustered a second time at Aulis, Agamemnon is persuaded by Calchas to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to appease the goddess Artemis and obtain safe passage for the ships, after he offends her by killing a stag. Iphigeneia is fetched as though for marriage with Achilles.\nArtemis, however, snatches her away, substituting a deer on the altar, and transports her to the land of the Tauri, making her immortal.\n\nNext they sail as far as Tenedos, where while they are feasting, Philoctetes is bitten by a snake and is left behind in Lemnos. Here, too, Achilles quarrels with Agamemnon. A first landing at the Troad is repulsed by the Trojans, and Protesilaus is killed by Hector. Achilles then kills Cycnus, the son of Poseidon, and drives the Trojans back. The Greeks take up their dead and send envoys to the Trojans demanding the surrender of Helen and the treasure. The Trojans refusing, they first attempt an assault upon the city, and then lay waste the country round about.\n\nAchilles desires to see Helen, and Aphrodite and Thetis contrive a meeting between them. The Achaeans next desire to return home, but are restrained by\nAchilles, who afterwards drives off the cattle of Aeneas, sacks neighbouring cities, and kills Troilus. Patroclus carries away Lycaon to Lemnos and sells him as a slave, and out of the spoils Achilles receives Briseis as a prize, and Agamemnon Chryseis.\nThen follow the death of Palamedes, the plan of Zeus to relieve the Trojans by detaching Achilles from the Hellenic confederacy, and a catalogue of the Trojan allies.\n\nThe \"Cypria\" was considered to be a lesser work than Homer's two masterpieces: Aristotle criticised it for its lack of narrative cohesion and focus. It was rather a catalogue of events than a unified story.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1925 as a public-service organization, it is Denmark's oldest and largest electronic media enterprise. DR is a founding member of the European Broadcasting Union.\n\nDR is funded by a media licence which is charged to all Danish households with television sets, computers, smartphones and other devices with internet access.\n\nToday, DR operates six television channels, all of which are distributed free-to-air via a nationwide DVB-T network. DR also operates eight radio channels. All are available nationally on DAB+ radio and online, with the four original stations also available on FM radio.\n\nDR was founded on April 1, 1925 under the name of \"Radioordningen\", which was changed to \"Statsradiofonien\" in 1926, to \"Danmarks Radio\" in 1959, and to \"DR\" in 1996.\n\nDuring the German occupation of Denmark in World War II, radio broadcasts were censored – under particularly harsh conditions from August 1943 – leading many Danes to turn to Danish-language broadcasts from the BBC or the illegal press, as well as Swedish radio in 1944–1945.\n\nStatsradiofonien's second FM radio station, Program 2 (P2), was added in 1951, followed by P3 in 1963.\n\nExperimental television broadcasts started in 1949, with regular programming beginning on October 2, 1951 with the launch of Denmark's first television channel. Daily programming began in 1954. Colour television test broadcasts were started in March 1967, with the first large-scale colour broadcasting occurring for the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France. Danmarks Radio officially ended \"test\" transmissions of colour television on April 1, 1970, although it wasn't until 1978 that their last black-and-white television program (\"TV Avisen\") switched to colour.\n\nOn exactly 16 May 1983 at 14:00 CEST, DR launched its first teletext information service, which is still available on all DR channels.\n\nDanmarks Radio's monopoly on national television lasted until 1988, when TV 2 started broadcasting. 8 years later DR launched their second television channel, DR2 on August 30, 1996. It was sometimes called \"den hemmelige kanal\" (\"the secret channel\") in its early years because it could not be seen nationwide at its launch.\n\nThe first trials of DAB were carried out in 1995, with eight channels officially launching in October 2002.\n\nOn June 7, 2007, DR launched an online-only news channel DR Update. It was later added as a traditional channel. At the Danish changeover to over-the-air digital signals on November 1, 2009, DR added three new channels to their lineup\n\nIn 2013 a new logo in which the letters \"DR\" featured in a white sans-serif font on a black background was introduced, and the line-up of television channels was changed once again. A new channel targeting young people, DR3 replaced DR HD. Another channel for children, DR Ultra replaced DR Update. The closure of DR Update was the start of a revamping of DR 2 as a channel for news and society.\n\nA nationwide switch from DAB to the newer DAB+ format took place on 1 October 2017. All of DR's stations plus the privately owned, public service channel - Radio24Syv, moved to the second national DAB+ multiplex (DAB-blok 2).\n\nThe principal means of funding DR is through the media licence, costing 2.492 DKK per year per household since 2017. Traditionally, radio and television owners were obliged to pay the licence, though the increased availability of online streaming led to the television licence being replaced by the media licence on January 1, 2007. The media licence is mandatory for all owners of television sets, as well as computers, smartphones or other devices with internet access.\n\nIn 2007 approximately 180,000 households did not pay media licence.\n\nRevenue also comes from commercial activities such as concerts and events in the Koncerthuset, from book, CD, and DVD sales, and from overseas sales of its catalogue of programmes.\n\nOver a period of four years starting in 2019 through 2022 the media license will be replaced by general taxation, as announced on 16 March 2018 by a majority in the Danish Parliament consisting of Venstre, Conservatives, Liberal Alliance, and Danish People's Party.\n\n\n\n\n\nDenmark\n\nAll of Denmark is covered by digital terrestrial reception through a nationwide DVB-T and MPEG-4 network comprising six multiplexes (MUX). DR owns MUXes 1 and 2 in a joint-venture between DR and TV 2. MUXes 1 and 2 broadcast all six DR channels unencrypted. Given the low topography of the Danish mainland and islands, so-called signal overspill is inevitable if every part of the country is to receive coverage. Hence, all DRs' channels are available in northernmost Germany, and Scania the southernmost part of Sweden.\n\nGreenland\n\nEvery city in Greenland can receive DR1, DR2 and DR Ultra free-to-air via a public DVB-T network.\n\nFaroe Islands\n\nThe company, Televarpið, a subsidiary of Faroese Telecom covers the Faroe Islands with a DVB-T network broadcasting DR1, DR2, DR3, DR Ramasjang and DR Ultra.\n\nDR's online presence includes a comprehensive news website and archive. It was launched as DR Online in 1996. According to Kantar Gallup, dr.dk is Denmark's most visited site.\n\nAnother large part of the site allows users to watch and listen to most Television and Radio output live and for some time after broadcast using the DR TV and DR Radio platforms.\n\n\nDisbanded DR Orchestras\n\nSince 1963, DR has awarded the Rosenkjær Prize to a person who has proven an ability to make a difficult subject accessible to a wider audience in an understandable and vivid form. The prizewinner commits to hold a number of radio lectures. The prize is named after Jens Rosenkjær (1883–1976), Head of State Broadcasting 1937–53. The prize is now DKK 50,000, up from 25,000 in 2008, and 40,000 in 2009\n\nDR's board of directors comprises 11 members appointed for a four-year period. Three members, including the chair, are appointed by the Minister of Culture, and six by Parliament, while the employees of DR elect two members. The board has overall responsibility for DR programs and for the hiring of DR's chief executive, the director general, and the remaining management positions.\n\nDR moved in 2006-2007 all its activities from Radiohuset in Frederiksberg and TV-Byen in Søborg to a new complex in the Ørestad area of Copenhagen. The new building, called DR Byen (the DR city), covers an area of approximately .\n\nThe project became more expensive than planned, forcing DR to make drastic budget cuts. In April 2007 it was announced that 300 employees would be laid off, meaning that most of the sports department would be closed down as well as most of the educational department, several programmes and the radio channel DR X. DR would also give up its rights to the Olympic Games and attempt to sell the rights to a number of other sports events including football.\n\nAs the major recipient of license funds, DR operates under a public service contract with the government which it was unable to fulfil in the wake of the budget crisis related to the move. The budget overspends caused a major scandal which saw senior management of DR replaced, and was followed by a heated political debate over whether the service should receive additional emergency funding. Various measures to mitigate the impact on the public service obligations of the institution were contemplated by the Danish Parliament, and a compromise was agreed to limit the impact of the deficit.\n\nFor over a decade, the Danish People's Party, a nativist and anti-immigrant political party, has criticized DR for alleged bias in its political news coverage, citing the process for appointment to DR's board of directors. In response, DR set up a \"watchdog committee\" intended to detect and report upon any bias.\n\nThe first large-scale scientific content analysis of political news coverage on DR published by the Centre for Journalism at the University of Southern Denmark, studying election news coverage in the years 1994–2007, documented no persistent political bias towards either the left or the right. News coverage of political actors and parties was found to be largely similar to the news coverage on DR's competitor TV 2. The study concluded that political news coverage on both broadcasters was guided by journalistic professional criteria as to the newsworthiness of political actors and political issues, not by partisan considerations.\n\nIn 2008, Mikael Rothstein, author and professor of religious history at the University of Copenhagen, was highly critical of DR when it issued a Christian values policy, declaring that Muslims would feel excluded.\n\n\n"}

It was released for free download on September 29, 2013, by Maybach Music Group and Dream Chasers Records. The mixtape also released on mixtape hosting websites. The mixtape features guest appearances from Travis Scott, Diddy, Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, Mase, French Montana, Future, Yo Gotti, Fabolous and Jadakiss, along with his Dream Chasers Records artists Lil Snupe, Omelly, Louie V Gutta and Guordan Banks, among others.\n\nIn November 2012, in an interview with Cosmic Kev producer, Jahlil Beats stated that he would be producing on \"Dreamchasers 3\". On January 5, 2013, Meek Mill revealed a tentative track listing on his Instagram. On March 8, 2013, Meek Mill announced that the mixtape would be released on May 6, 2013. On August 26, 2013, he announced that the mixtape would be released on September 20, 2013. On September 3, 2013, the mixtape was pushed back until September 29, 2013. The following day, the first song from the mixtape that was released was a track called \"I B On That\" featuring Nicki Minaj, French Montana and Fabolous. On September 11, 2013, he released the final cover artwork for his mixtape. On September 25, 2013, in an interview with \"Rolling Stone\", he spoke about a song he was going to make the intro of the mixtape, saying: \"Kendrick's verse. Kendrick's verse, man. [Laughs] I don't know if I'ma keep it, though. Some of the guys I'm throwing shots at, I'm actually cool with these guys and I don't really be throwing shots at guys I'm cool with ... that really was influenced by the Kendrick shit, so we'll determine by tonight if I'ma finish that or not. My focus is on the intro, on making another fire-ass intro that I can go crazy to in the club.\"\n\nOn October 1, 2013, the music video was released for \"I B On That\" featuring Nicki Minaj, French Montana and Fabolous. On December 11, 2013, the music video was released for \"I'm Leanin\" featuring Travis Scott. On January 31, 2014, the music video was released for \"Heaven or Hell\" featuring Jadakiss and Guordan Banks.\n\n\"Dreamchasers 3\" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Jake Rohn of BET gave the mixtape four out of five stars, saying \"\"Dreamchasers 3\", like most mixtapes, does have some filler like \"My Life\" and the monotonous \"We Ain't the Same\" (which ironically bares too much similarity to what every other rapper is saying on records these days). It's not perfect, but it's pretty close.With Meek's current momentum, a slew of fellow dreamchasers in his corner and one of the strongest teams in the game behind him, he is establishing himself again as a true star on this tape and a deadly opponent on the mic.\" Bruce Smith of HipHopDX gave the album a positive review, saying \"Fans of Meek Mill’s \"Dreamchasers\" or \"Dreamchasers 2\", are bound to find much to like about \"Dreamchasers 3\". However, when Meek’s competition is talking about raising the bar lyrically, and he continues to rap about repo-ing women, and comparing diamond flooded watches to the disaster that was Hurricane Katrina, it won’t be surprising if his overall standing within the game takes another hit. This edition of \"Dreamchasers\" is closed out with what sounds to be an intro to Meek’s next effort, and hopefully that project shows the growth many think Meek Mill is capable of.\" Emmanuel C.M. of \"XXL\" gave the mixtape an L, saying \"Even though the tape isn’t game changing, it does show that Meek is very capable of making propulsive rap music that can also serve as hits. No longer is he only capable of making street anthems; he can actually churn out a vast array of records that will actually get spins. The growth is there. He’s using his strength, raw emotion and skill as a storyteller, and mastering his craft as an artist. However, this is far from the main course, just a table of different selections to temper the appetite.\"\n\nOn December 24, 2013, \"XXL\" ranked it at number 20 of their list of best mixtapes of the year.\n"}

It also includes smaller segments like radio, music, OOH, animation, gaming and visual effects (VFX) and Internet advertising. Entertainment industry in India has registered an explosive growth in last two decades making it one of the fastest growing industries in India. From a single state owned channel, Doordarshan in the 1990s there are more than 400 active channels in the country. Worldwide, 2010 saw the global economy begin to recover from a steep decline in 2009. Improved economic conditions in 2010 played a major role in a rebound in customer spend. Since the world economy begin to recover from the global financial crisis of 2008, improved economic conditions played a major role in rebound in consumer spend. While India was not critically impacted by the downturn in 2008 and 2009, it demonstrated one of the highest growth rates this year and continued to at a healthy pace. The rising rate of investments by the private sector and foreign media and entertainment (M&E) majors have improved India's entertainment infrastructure to a great extent. As per the recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Indians are likely to spend more on entertainment in the coming years with a steady growth in their disposable income. And as per the combined survey report by KMPG and FICCI, the entertainment industry in India is expected to expand by 12.5% every year and is likely to reach US$20.09 billion by the year 2013. The industry pegged at INR 5808 billion in 2009 as compared to INR 3565 billion in 2005. The Indian Media & Entertainment Industry grew from US$12.9 billion in 2009 to US$14.4 billion in 2010, a growth of 11 per cent, according to a report by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and research firm KPMG. The report also states that backed by positive industry sentiment and growing media consumption, the industry is estimated to achieve growth of 13 per cent in 2011 to touch US$16.2 billion. As the industry braces for exciting times ahead, the sector is projected to grow at a CAGR of 14 percent to reach US$28.1 billion by 2015.\n\nTelevision is one of the major mass media of India and is a huge industry and has thousands of programs in all the states of India. Today India boasts of being the second largest television market in the world. The small screen has produced numerous celebrities of their own kind some even attaining national fame. TV soaps are extremely popular with housewives as well as working women. Approximately half of all Indian households own a television. Television first came to India in the form of Doordarshan (DD) on Sept 15, 1959. Doordarshan is the National Television Network of India and also one of the largest broadcasting organisations in the world. Apart from the state run Doordarshan, there are six DTH players with 54.52 million DTH users in India with the present prediction; it is likely to overtake the US in terms of the largest DTH market in the world. As of 2012, the country has a collection of free and subscription services over a variety of distribution media, through which there are over 823 channels of which 184 are pay channels. Total television viewership of 415 million is amongst the world’s highest with nearly 15-16 Television companies beaming programmers to India. The major players being Doordarshan, STAR TV (Satellite Television Asia Network), Zee Television, United Television, CNN, Sony Television, ATN (Asia Television Network), BBC World, SUN TV, Discovery Channel, TNT and Others. India’s television business has an estimated $3.4 billion in revenue in 2005, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. With the government is focusing more on Digitalisation, TV distribution is taking new shape Digitalisation has been a major challenge for the government as digital cable is not gaining momentum. According to the new deadline, pan India digitalisation us expected to happen by December 31, 2014. Another challenge for the Television Industry is Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). India is amongst the countries with lowest ARPU as compared to developed countries like US and UK where ARPU is around US$45 to US$60, India has an ARPU approximately US$3.5.\n\nThe Indian print media industry is expected to grow by 9.6 per cent over the period 2010-15. The print industry is expected to grow from Rs 128 bn in 2006 to Rs 232 bn by 2011, at 12.6% CAGR. While the newspaper industry is estimated at Rs 112 bn, the magazine segment is valued at Rs 16 bn. The newspaper industry is also projected to perform well for the next five years growing at a CAGR of 10.1 per cent according to a report titled \"India Entertainment and Media Outlook 2011\" by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Indian print industry is growing strong and is expected to grow similarly while the global print industry is moving towards digitalisation and showing a negative growth rate year on year. Print industry in India is the world's second largest with over 90 million copies in circulation daily after China with 130 million copies in circulation daily. Most newspaper has an online presence and a growing view counts on their portals. Much of the entertainment and media segments are now focusing on growth in regional areas and smaller towns. Year 2009, a year when there was a slowdown, the regional print showed growth in local to local advertisement. In 2010, regional print further increased its share in overall print advertisement revenue pie. Regional papers give advertisers access to localised populations and their niche target audience, difficult to do via national broadcast media. Newspapers have realised value and have gone one step further and have launched area specific newspapers. With the rise in literacy in past decade has let to the rise of regional newspapers, they have much greater reach and a large audience to entertain. Magazines have not been at their best performance in past few years. However, niche magazine are doing well and is expected to show positive growth. The major challenge faced by this segment of media and entertainment industry is newsprint which continues to threaten profitability. Newsprint forms a major component of the cost of publishing a newspaper. It is roughly 40 -50 percent of the total cost.\n\nFilms are the most important form of entertainment in India. Film industry in India is among the largest in the world in terms of films produced (approximately 1000) in different languages which include films in Hindi, Kannada, Bengali, Tamil,marathi, Telugu, Punjabi and Malayalam. Approximately twenty-three million Indians go to see a film every day. Film Federation of India is the apex body of film industry in India whose objective is to popularise and promote the cinema Bollywood accounts for 46 percent of the total Indian film industry revenues film industry experts. According to unofficial estimates available in January 2001, the Indian film industry has an annual turnover of Rs. 60 billion (approximately US$1.33 billion). It employs more than 6 million people, most of whom are contract workers as opposed to regular employees. As at the start of 2001, a reasonable budget film in Hindi could cost US$1.75 million. A low budget Hindi film can be made for even as low as Rs. 15 million. A big budget Hindi movie can cost in excess of US$30 million. The 'bigness' of the budget is attributable mainly to the high fees paid to 'stars', celebrated music directors, high-end technologies and expensive travel costs to shoot in exotic locations worldwide. At the time of writing, it is believed that 'stars' like Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan are paid around Rs. 100 million (US$440,000) per film. India has a National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) which finances some films. A few film makers, who would find it hard to obtain finance from the regular sources, have been financed by the NFDC. However, NFDC cannot be considered to play a central role in the film industry because it finances too few films which, too, are not of the type that has made the Indian film industry so vibrant.\n\nRadio broadcasting in India started in British India in 1923 with the Radio Club of Bombay. All India Radio (AIR) was established in 1936 which is one of the largest radio networks in the world including the AIR FM. AM, FM and even Satellite Radio have made a huge impact on the Industry in India. Most of the media houses either already have a presence in the industry or are looking to get a license in the next round. Famous stations are Radio Mirchi (of the Times Group) has maintained a lead position in most cities it operates in and other channels like Radio City, Red FM, Big FM, Fever, Radio One have also been able to get significant traction. Till 1990 Indian economy was closed, no private player was allowed to enter and Akashwani has the sole responsibility to cater to the wide and culturally diverse Indian consumer base. In the last 5 years, the Radio industry in India has seen a compound annual growth rate of approximately 20% and has grown to a size of around Rs. 8.3 billion in 2008. By the end of the 2010, there were 245 active radio stations in India and had a market size of INR 10 billion. It registered a cumulative growth rate of 11 percent from 2007 to 2010. The industry is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20 percent over 2010- 2015 and is expected to be INR 25 billion in terms of revenue. Phase III privatisation of the radio FM is expected to add 839 new radio stations in 294 cities. The government has approved Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in FM radio channels to 26 percent from the current 20 percent. Ministry of Information and broadcasting is planning to release additional frequencies in all markets, automatic renewal of license at the end of the initial term of the license of the term. One of the major reasons for such an interest in the industry is the increased profitability. The government has cut the license fees to 1/10th of the previous amount.\n\nIndian film industry has been engaging in illegal activities by hiring IT professionals who are launching Denial-of-service attack against websites that they believe are violating the intellectual property of their clients.<ref name=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100905/11383610909.shtml\"></ref><ref name=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/10/bollywood_cyber_vigilantes_fight_movie_pirates/\"></ref>\n\n"}

He was half of the pop duo Milli Vanilli, with Rob Pilatus, selling multi-platinum albums around the world. However, he was later involved in one of the largest scandals in pop music history when it was revealed that neither he nor Pilatus had actually sung on any of Milli Vanilli's recordings. After the scandal, the group reformed as Rob & Fab in the 1990s with limited success. Morvan had a solo comeback in the 2000s releasing his first solo album, \"Love Revolution\".\n\nMorvan was born in 1966 in Paris, France, to parents from Guadeloupe. At 18, he moved to Germany, where he was a dancer and model, and was influenced by funk, soul, hip hop and pop. He met Rob Pilatus in a nightclub in Munich. They decided to form a rock/soul group.\n\nMorvan and Pilatus were noticed by music producer Frank Farian, who signed them as part of a musical act. Shortly after a trip to Turkey, where they reputedly got the band's name from a local advertising slogan, Milli Vanilli was born. Morvan and Pilatus served as the public faces for singers Charles Shaw, John Davis, and Brad Howell, who Farian thought were talented musicians but lacked a marketable image.\n\nThe first Milli Vanilli album was \"Girl You Know It's True\". Despite critical derision, Milli Vanilli's fame continued to grow worldwide. The album had four hit singles: the title track, and the group's three #1 hits, \"Girl I'm Gonna Miss You\", \"Baby Don't Forget My Number\", and \"Blame It on the Rain\". Milli Vanilli won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist on 22 February 1990 for \"Girl You Know It's True\".\n\nMorvan and Pilatus were a frequent target of rumours and allegations of on-stage lip-synching and not having sung on the album. Shaw told a reporter the truth about Milli Vanilli, but recanted after Farian paid him $150,000 to do so .\n\nWhen Morvan and Pilatus pressured Farian to let them sing on the next album, Farian admitted to reporters on 15 November 1990 that Morvan and Pilatus had not actually sung on any of the records. As a result, Milli Vanilli's Grammy was withdrawn four days later and Arista Records dropped the act from its roster and deleted their album and its masters from their catalog, thus making \"Girl You Know It's True\" one of the largest-selling albums to ever be taken out of print. A court allowed any American who bought the album to get a refund.\n\nFarian would later attempt a failed comeback for the group without Morvan and Pilatus.\n\nMonths later, Morvan and Pilatus parodied the scandal in a commercial for Carefree sugarless gum. They began to lip sync to an opera recording. An announcer asked as they were lip synching, \"How long does the taste of Carefree sugarless gum last?\" The record then began to skip and the announcer answers, \"Until these guys sing for themselves.\"\n\nThey then moved to Los Angeles, where they released an eponymous album under the name \"Rob & Fab\". Despite positive reviews from critics, the album failed due to financial constraints, poor promotion, and the scandal surrounding Milli Vanilli's lip-synching allegations. The album itself only sold around 2,000 copies.\n\nPilatus later served three months jail for assault, vandalism, and attempted robbery. He spent six months on drug rehabilitation before returning to Germany. He died of an alcohol and prescription drug overdose at a hotel in Frankfurt on 2 April 1998.\n\nMorvan spent several years as a session musician and public speaker. In 1998, he was hired as a radio DJ at famed L.A. radio station KIIS-FM. During this time, he also performed at the station's sold-out 1999 Wango Tango festival concert before 50,000 people at Dodger Stadium.\n\nIn 1997, Morvan was interviewed for the premiere episode of VH-1's \"Behind the Music\". He was also featured in a 2000 BBC documentary on Milli Vanilli. Morvan then spent 2001 on tour, before performing in 2002 as the inaugural performer at the brand-new Velvet Lounge at the Hard Rock Café Hotel in Orlando, Florida.\n\nIn 2003, Morvan released his first solo album, \"Love Revolution\", producing, recording, writing and singing all the tracks. On 14 April 2011, Morvan released a new single, \"Anytime\", to digital outlets.\n\nOn 25 May 2012, Morvan released a single, \"See the Light\" with a new band, Fabulous Addiction.\n\nIn March 2014, it was mentioned that Morvan was working on his next single in Los Angeles with Grammy-winning viral producer Clarence Jey and Grammy-winning singer Delious Kennedy from U.S. R&B group All-4-One.\n\nMorvan also DJs for private Heineken functions at the Heineken Experience center in Amsterdam. As a solo musician, Morvan has worked with several DJ/producers including Don Diablo, Guy J, Dance Spirit, Desert Minds, DJ Prinz, Patrick BP Bruyndonx, MuziJunki, Sean McCaff, Limoncello, Guan Elmzoom, and has collaborated on well-received dance releases with several. Some of his other pursuits include writing, painting and fashion design.\n\nOn 14 February 2007, it was announced that Universal Pictures was developing a film based on the true story of Milli Vanilli's rise and fall in the music industry. Jeff Nathanson, screenwriter from \"Catch Me If You Can\", was to write and direct the film. Morvan was supposed to serve as a consultant, providing his and Pilatus' point of view. However, the project was never completed. In 2011 German director Florian Gallenberger declared that he was reviving the project and would be rewriting the script.\n\nOn 26 March 2007, the Milli Vanilli \"Best of the Best\" album was released.\n\nMorvan now resides in Amsterdam and Los Angeles as of 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her début was in \"Pavillon,\" in Vienna. She also appeared on stage with Marlene Dietrich in \"Broadway,\" in which she sang and danced.\n\nA recording contract with Ultraphon in 1929 took her from Vienna to Prague and Berlin, where she enjoyed great success with Peter Igelhoff and Peter Kreuder. For over 45 years her voice was familiar worldwide, in radio shows, films, revues, concerts and musicals, but above all in recordings. First called \"The Great Lady Of Chanson\" in her native Vienna, the nickname followed her to London and America.\n\nGreta Keller's first marriage to the singer Joe Sargent (1928) did not last. He turned out to be an alcoholic.\nHer second marriage started and ended in Hollywood where she met and married Gaspar Griswold Bacon, Jr. son of Gaspar G. Bacon from a prominent \"Boston Brahmin\" family. The elder Bacon was a member of the board of Harvard University, and had been a close associate of J.P. Morgan, and later served as Secretary of State under Theodore Roosevelt and ambassador to France under William Howard Taft.\n\nHer husband, known in film and theater as David Bacon, was murdered in 1943, two weeks after finishing a major role in the Republic serial \"The Masked Marvel\". Speculation involved affairs with Howard Hughes and another actor, but the murder investigations ceased without a result and the files later disappeared. Due to that shock and a counter-indicated dose of morphein administered by Bacon's brother, a physician, Greta's child with Bacon was stillborn. It took some time for her to recover from these events, but she restarted her career in Switzerland, then on to Vienna, Berlin and back to New York City.\n\nGreta Keller's last long-time relationship: The last years of her life, from 1973 until her death in November 1977 Greta lived, worked, and traveled with her last partner, Wolfgang Nebmaier, who now lives in Southern Oregon, tends to his wife and their goats and other animals and writes stage and screen plays. (See also Chanteusemovie.com).\n\nHer lieder voice carried the charm of the Parisian women but never lost the heart of the girl from Vienna. Greta's singing in what some call \"a style reminiscent of Marlene Dietrich\" comes from the fact she was the model for how Marlene Dietrich developed her own voice. Greta Keller made recordings throughout the world and from the 1920s into the 1970s. She spent many years in the United States, notably in hotel club rooms at the Waldorf and (later) the Stanhope in New York, where her show always included \"My Way\", with lyrics composed by Paul Anka, and a number of Noël Coward numbers. A \"singer's singer,\" Keller often drew other performers to the room, including the Nordstrom Sisters, Beverly Sills and Hildegarde.\n\nOther regulars would book the same tables most nights that she was performing, including photographer Edgar de Evia. Favorites of the Stanhope crowd were the songs of Cole Porter and Noël Coward, for their sexual innuendo and double entendres. These included \"Miss Otis Regrets\" and \"I'm the Other Woman in His Life\" by her close friend Elisse Boyd. She regularly returned to Vienna. The poet and singer Rod McKuen was introduced by her to an audience in Vienna. McKuen, in turn, hosted a concert presenting her at Lincoln Center in the 1970s, and wrote the English lyric \"If You Go Away\" to Jacques Brel's \"Ne Me Quitte Pas,\" which she always sang.\n\nHer repertoire included songs from the 1930s through the war years as well as popular songs of the day. A few years before her death, her voice was heard in the Academy Award-winning movie, \"Cabaret\" (1972), for which she sang the song, \"\"Heirat\" (Married)\".\nKeller was buried on the Wiener Zentralfriedhof.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was released on Gore's first album \"I'll Cry If I Want To\" and also as a single which reached #5 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and #10 on the Billboard R&B singles chart.

The sequel, \"Judy's Turn to Cry,\" was recorded on May 14, 1963. In \"It's My Party,\" the singer was in tears because her boyfriend Johnny left with her best friend Judy. In \"Judy's Turn to Cry,\" the singer kisses another boy at another party in order to make Johnny jealous and Johnny hits the other boy and returns to her. In the chorus, which also opens the song, the triumphant singer gloats that \"Well now it's Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry; 'cause Johnny's come back to me.\" Until then the singer's \"tears just fell like rain drops\" because \"Judy's smile was so mean.\" With its emphasis on crying—in this case Judy rather than the singer—the song fit in with the theme of the album \"I'll Cry If I Want To\", in which most of the songs involved someone crying.\n\nThe song's instrumentation includes drums and horns. Allmusic critic Joe Viglione describes \"Judy's Turn to Cry\" as having \"a monstrous hook as valuable as 'It's My Party' with violence that may have been inspired by The Crystals pushing the envelope with their withdrawn classic 'He Hit Me (It Felt Like a Kiss)'\". Viglione also notes that because both \"It's My Party\" and \"Judy's Turn to Cry\" are short, both at just under 2:20, and both songs are different from each other, and each starts off with its own identifiable hook, and the choruses are different but the verses tell one continuous story, the two songs could be played on the radio back to back, allowing Gore to sing the entire \"soap opera.\" This song is in the key of D Major, while \"It's my Party\" is in the key of A Major. Connie Landers sang the two songs back to back on the 2008 album \"Girls Girls Girls: 1960's Rock N Roll\". Author Maury Dean notes that Gore's \"crisp soprano uses very sophisticated jazz progressions.\" Music journalist Lillian Roxon commented that \"you could savor every bitchy second of Lesley's triumph with her sequel 'Judy's Turn to Cry.'\"\n\nSubsequent to initial release as a single and on \"I'll Cry If I Want To\", \"Judy's Turn to Cry\" has been released on numerous Lesley Gore compilation albums. These include \"The Golden Hits of Lesley Gore\" in 1965, \"It's My Party: The Mercury Anthology\" in 1996, \"Sunshine, Lollipops, and Rainbows: The Best of Lesley Gore\" in 1998, \"20th Century Masters – The Millennium Collection\" in 2000 and \"The Ultimate Collection 1963–1968: Start the Party Again\" in 2005. It has also been included on a number of multi-artist compilations of 1960s songs.\n"}

Founded in March 2014 by brothers Antoine and Michel Morcos, the company first came into the public eye in 2014, through its port of the open-source game \"2048\". Many of Ketchapp's games are unlicensed variations of popular casual games by other developers. Ketchapp was acquired by Ubisoft in September 2016.\n\nKetchapp was founded by brothers Antoine and Michel Morcos on 7 March 2014 in Paris.\n\nIn March 2014, the company cloned Gabriele Cirulli's open-source puzzle game \"2048\" and published it as an iOS app, with advertising and in-app purchases. It eventually reached the top of the iOS App Store charts. Ketchapp became successful by adapting ideas from other popular apps, with many of its releases being variations on existing games, such as reworking the popular 2013 game \"Flappy Bird\" as \"Run Bird Run\".\n\nIn February 2015, the company released the scrolling reaction game \"ZigZag\", which was praised for not being a clone of an existing game, however, in April 2015, developer Mudloop accused Ketchapp that \"ZigZag\" was a version of their game, \"Zig Zag Boom\", that was submitted to but rejected by Ketchapp, and published under a different title without credit. Mudloop later stated that they had learned that their submission of \"Zig Zag Boom\" to Ketchapp post-dated Ketchapp having a working version of \"ZigZag\".\n\nAs of November 2017, Ketchapp has released 137 games, including \"Jelly Jump\". On 27 September 2016, French video game publisher Ubisoft announced that they had acquired Ketchapp.\n\nOn 16 May 2017, Ketchapp released a fidget spinner-themed game, titled simply \"Fidget Spinner\" and developed by Estoty. The app received seven million downloads in the first two weeks after it was released, as a result of which Ketchapp set up a Fanfiber store to sell limited edition Ketchapp-branded fidget spinners.\n"}

It is a variant of the classical count and capture game \"mancala\" (from the Arabic word \"naqala\", meaning literally \"to move\"), which is one of the oldest two-player strategy board games played throughout the world. \"Layli Goobalay\" means \"to exercise with circles\" in the Somali language.\n\nLayli Goobalay is played on a 2x6 mancala board (i.e., 2 rows of 6 pits each), with 48 seeds. At game setup, 4 seeds are placed in each pit. Similar equipment and game setup are used for in other mancalas.\n\nAt his or her turn, the player takes all the seeds from a pit and sows them counterclockwise. If the last seed of a sowing falls in a non-empty pit that is not a \"Uur\" (see below), relay-sowing applies. Thus, the player's turn ends when the last seed in a sowing is dropped in an empty pit or in a \"Uur\" pit. Depending on the pit where this last seed was dropped, the following situations may occur:\n\n\nA player can never begin a sowing from \"Uur\" pits, and relay-sowing does not apply to \"Uur\" pits. Consequently, the content of \"Uur\" pits tends to grow over time.\n\nThe game ends when one of the player can no longer move. Both players then capture the seeds from their own \"Uur\"s (remember that a player can own a \"Uur\" in the opponent's row) and from the other pits in their own rows. The player who captured most seeds wins the game.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48352", "title": "Le Pétomane", "text": "Le Pétomane\n\nLe Pétomane (, ) was the stage name of the French flatulist (professional farter) and entertainer Joseph Pujol (June 1, 1857 – 1945). He was famous for his remarkable control of the abdominal muscles, which enabled him to seemingly fart at will. His stage name combines the French verb \"péter\", \"to fart\" with the -\"mane\", \"-maniac\" suffix, which translates to \"fartomaniac\". The profession is also referred to as \"flatulist\", \"farteur\", or \"fartiste\".\n\nIt is a common misconception that Joseph Pujol actually passed intestinal gas as part of his stage performance. Rather, Pujol was able to \"inhale\" or move air into his rectum and then control the release of that air with his anal sphincter muscles. Evidence of his ability to control those muscles was seen in the early accounts of demonstrations of his abilities to fellow soldiers.\n\nJoseph Pujol was born in Marseilles, one of five children of stonemason/sculptor François Pujol and his wife Rose, in a Catalan origin family. Soon after Pujol left school, he had a strange experience while swimming in the sea. He put his head under the water and held his breath, whereupon he felt an icy cold penetrating his rear. He ran ashore in fright and was amazed to sense water pouring from his anus. A doctor assured him that there was nothing to worry about.\n\nWhile serving in the army, he told his fellow soldiers about his special ability, and repeated it for their amusement, sucking up water from a pan into his rectum and then projecting it up to several yards. He found that he could suck in air as well. A baker, Pujol would sometimes entertain his customers by imitating musical instruments, and claim to be playing them behind the counter. Pujol decided to try the stage, and debuted in Marseilles in 1887. When his act was well received, he moved to Paris, where he appeared at the Moulin Rouge in 1892.\n\nSome of the highlights of his stage act involved sound effects of cannon fire and thunderstorms, as well as playing \"'O Sole Mio\" and \"La Marseillaise\" on an ocarina through a rubber tube in his anus. He could also blow out a candle from several yards away. His audience included Edward, Prince of Wales; King Leopold II of the Belgians; and Sigmund Freud.\nIn 1894, the managers of the Moulin Rouge sued Pujol for an impromptu exhibition he gave to aid a friend struggling with economic difficulties. Pujol was fined 3,000 francs, and the Moulin Rouge lost their star attraction as the disagreement led him to set up his own travelling show called the Theatre Pompadour.\n\nIn the following decade Pujol tried to 'refine' and make his acts 'gentler'; one of his favourite numbers became a rhyme about a farm which he himself composed, and which he punctuated with anal renditions of the animals' sounds.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I, Pujol, horrified by the inhumanity of the conflict, retired from the stage and returned to his bakery in Marseilles. Later he opened a biscuit factory in Toulon. He died in 1945, aged 88, and was buried in the cemetery of La Valette-du-Var, where his grave can still be seen today.\n\nLe Pétomane left an enduring legacy and has inspired a number of artistic works. These include several musicals based on his life, such as \"The Fartiste\" (awarded Best Musical at the 2006 New York International Fringe Festival) and Seth Rozin's \"A Passing Wind\" which was premiered at the Philadelphia International Festival of the Arts in 2011. In addition, Le Pétomane was added to David Lee's 2007 reworked revival of the 1953 Broadway play \"Can-Can\", which had originally been written by Abe Burroughs and Cole Porter. The updated play, staged at the Pasadena Playhouse, featured musical theatre actor Robert Yacko as the fartiste, with sound effects provided by the band's trombone and piccolo players. More recently, the re-released works of English toilet humour specialist Ivor Biggun include \"Southern Breeze\", a song about a \"Famous French Farteur\" who describes in rhyme a stroll through a farmyard, accompanied by appropriate farting noises.\n\nLos Angeles-based Sherbourne Press published Jean Nohain and F. Caradec's \"Le Pétomane\" as a small hardcover English language edition in 1967. Due to its ‘sensitive’ nature, the usual national publicity venues shied away, some claiming that an author was needed for interviews (both elderly writers lived in France). However, ‘behind the curtain’ acceptance created a buzz within the national radio/TV promotional circuit and word-of-mouth discussion kept the book in stores for several years. Dorset Press, a division of Barnes & Noble, reissued the book in 1993.\n\nThe character has been portrayed several times in film. In 1979 Ian MacNaughton made a short humorous film, written by Galton and Simpson called \"Le Pétomane\", based on Pujol's story and starring veteran comic actor Leonard Rossiter. The 1983 Italian movie \"Il Petomane\", directed by Pasquale Festa Campanile and starring Ugo Tognazzi, gives a poetic rendition of the character, contrasting his deep longing for normality with the condition of 'freak' to which his act relegated him. The 1998 documentary \"Le Pétomane\" by Igor Vamos examines Joseph Pujol's place in history through archival films (none of which actually include him), historical documents, photographs, recreations and fake or tongue-in-cheek interviews. He briefly appears as one of the performers in \"Moulin Rouge!\", played by Keith Robinson.\n\nLe Petomane is also referenced in \"Blazing Saddles\", a 1974 satirical Western comedy film directed by Mel Brooks. Brooks appears in multiple supporting roles, including the dim-witted Governor William J. Le Petomane, whose name suggests he is full of hot air.\n\nLe Petomane is the name of the university in \"Up the Creek\", a 1984 college movie starring Tim Matheson involving a whitewater rafting race.\n\nLe Petomane is also a character in the novel \"The Great Abraham Lincoln Pocket Watch Conspiracy\" by Jacopo della Quercia.\nand a nearly identical recording horn.\n\nLe Petomane also appears as a character in 2001 Australian-American jukebox musical romantic comedy film \"Moulin Rouge!\"\n\n'Le Petoman' (without the e, English audiences will pronounce -mane differently to -man) was adapted from the book by 'Le Petomane 1857-1945' by J Nohain & F Caradec for the theatre in 2001 by Tony Stowers. It was turned down by Hull Truck, Salisbury Playhouse and the National Theatre in the UK on the grounds that they felt their audiences would be 'too sophisticated' for the subject matter. Instead it has been read in English in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 2005, in Paris in 2010 and again in Nantes in 2018 and to this day remains unperformed but often read. In 2010 it was translated to French by T Stowers and Kester Lovelace and appears in 'French Collection' by Tony Stowers and 'Plays: Volume Three' by Tony Stowers.\n\n\n\n"}

The entire series, consisting of 8 seasons and 692 episodes is available in both Australia and the UK. Initially released in \"Best Of\" compilation format on DVD in Australia with three sets, in the United States with the first two sets, and in the United Kingdom with only the first set.\n\nIn Australia, Shock Records commenced releasing what was to be the beginning of the entire series in 2006 in volume format on DVD; the complete series over 40 volumes. Prior to the release of Volume 13, \"The Complete Collection\" was made available with the remaining individual volumes released subsequently. A second version of \"The Complete Collection\" was released in 2011. All of the original sets are now out-of-print. As of late 2016, ViaVision are releasing \"Prisoner\" on DVD in their original complete season formats.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the series began releasing on VHS with the first 12 episodes over six videos and a video containing episodes 326 & 327. \"Prisoner Cell Block H\" DVDs have been released in stages by FremantleMedia Home Entertainment between 2008 - 2013. The content on the discs is identical to the Australian release, but with different cover/sleeve artwork. The UK releases started out as boxed sets of eight discs (32 episodes) with two discs in four cases within each set, but from Volume 4 onwards all the discs are packed into a plastic case with flip disc holders. The entire series has been released over a total of 20 volumes, the first 16 volumes featuring eight discs each but Volume 17 onwards contains ten discs.\n\nThe UK DVD releases are a combination of two volumes as released in Australia. For example, the UK Volume 1 consists of the Australian Volumes 1 and 2.\n\nAs with the Australian versions of the DVDs, the episodes are on the whole uncut, but due to the aged source of the master tapes, sometimes minor edits are made to the episodes to cover breaks in the picture or sound. \"The Edna Pearson Story\", released on UK DVD in February 2010, contains most of the previously cut scenes although, episode 470 is still missing a scene.\n\nThe first 12 episodes of \"Prisoner: Cell Block H\" were over six VHS tapes in the United States in 1993 via MPI Home Video\n\nNTV Entertainment released eight VHS tapes between 1993 and 1995 in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Prisoner\" is rated  M  (recommended for mature audiences) for moderate themes, violence, moderate violence, infrequent moderate violence, drug references, moderate drug references, moderate drug use, moderate drug themes and coarse language.\n\nIn late 2016, Australian distribution company ViaVision commenced releasing the series in their complete season formats on DVD and is under its original title of \"Prisoner\" as opposed to the Region 4 volume sets which contained the international title \"Prisoner: Cell Block H\". \n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Prisoner: Cell Block H\" was released via Fremantle Home Entertainment, beginning late 2008. The complete series was released through 20 volumes containing 32 episodes per set for the first sixteen volumes; Volume 17 contains 40 episodes, Volume 18 and Volume 19 both contain 48 episodes and the final volume contains 44 episodes. The reason for the increased number of episodes on later sets was due to the fact that Fremantle wanted to keep exactly double the amount of episodes as the original Australian sets. The first 33 Australian releases contain 16 episodes per set; sets 34 to 39 containing 24 episodes per set and Volume 40 containing 20 episodes. Therefore, Fremantle in the UK doubled-up on episodes so that they could finish releasing by Volume 20.\n\nIn Australia, distribution company Shock Records began releasing the UK volumes in 2011, as their original volumes are now out of print. The final volume was released in early 2014.\n\n"}

She was nicknamed \"The Joy Girl\", after playing the lead in the 1927 film of that same title. Borden was known for her jet-black hair and overall beauty.\n\nAt the peak of her career in the mid-1920s, Borden was earning $1,500 a week. In 1927, she walked out on her contract with Fox after refusing to take a pay cut. By 1929, her career began to wane due to her reputation for being temperamental and her difficulty transitioning to sound films. She made her last film, \"Chloe, Love Is Calling You\", in 1934 and moved on to stage work for a time. By the late 1930s, she had declared bankruptcy and stopped acting. During World War II, she joined the WACs. She was later honorably discharged after sustaining a foot injury and attempted to make a comeback in films. However, Borden's attempts to get back into acting were hindered by her alcoholism and health problems.\n\nIn 1945, she began working at the Sunshine Mission, a home for destitute women located in the skidrow section of Los Angeles. She died there in October 1947 of a stomach ailment and pneumonia at the age of 41.\n\nOlive Borden was born in Richmond, Virginia on July 14, 1906. Her birth name was often reported erroneously as Sybil Tinkle until the 1990s when it was discovered that another woman with the same name had been confused with Borden. Borden's father died when she was a baby and she was raised by her mother, Sybil (\"Sibbie\"), in Norfolk and Baltimore, Maryland where she also attended Catholic boarding schools. She was a distant relative of Lizzie Borden. As a teenager, she persuaded her mother to take her to Hollywood to pursue a career in show business. To support themselves they opened a candy store and Olive worked as a telephone operator.\n\nBorden began her career as one of the Sennett Bathing Beauties in 1922 and was soon appearing as a vamp in Hal Roach comedy shorts. Producer Paul Bern chose her for an uncredited role in his film \"The Dressmaker from Paris\" (1925). She was signed by Fox after being named a WAMPAS Baby Star in 1925 (along with cousin Natalie Joyce). Borden quickly became one of their most popular and highest paid stars earning a salary of $1,500 a week. She had starring roles in eleven films at Fox including \"3 Bad Men\" and \"Fig Leaves\", both costarring her then-boyfriend George O'Brien. During this time she worked with some directors who would go on to achieve major fame, including John Ford, Howard Hawks, and Leo McCarey.\n\nWhen Fox cut her salary in 1927, she walked out on her contract. By this point she was a major star but she found it difficult to make the transition from silent films to \"talkies\". She worked to get rid of her Southern accent but could not overcome her reputation as being difficult. She was still in demand as an actress, and continued to work for Columbia and RKO. Borden cut her trademark hair into a short bob and turned herself into a modern flapper. She made several movies in the early 1930s but her career stalled. Her last screen credit came in 1934 in the film \"Chloe, Love Is Calling You\". She moved to New York where she had a brief stage career and made a living on the vaudeville circuit.\n\nDuring her acting career, Borden was one of the highest paid stars. She spent her money freely and by the late 1930s, she was broke. Borden then found work as a postal clerk and mail carrier and also worked as a nurse's aide. In 1942, Borden joined the WAC where she received an army citation for bravery in turning over an enemy ammunition truck. Her Army career ended after she was hospitalized in Walter Reed Medical Center with a severe foot injury. After her honorable discharge she attempted an unsuccessful comeback in films.\n\nBorden struggled with alcoholism and numerous health problems. She spent her final years in the skid row section of Los Angeles scrubbing floors at the Sunshine Mission, a home for destitute women.\n\nBorden had several relationships with men in and out of the motion picture industry. For the majority of her life, she lived with her mother, Sibbie. From 1926 to 1930, Borden was romantically involved with actor George O'Brien and the press reported they were engaged. She also dated director Marshall Neilan, producer Paul Bern, and had a long affair with Arthur Benline, Lieutenant Commander in the Navy Construction Battalion.\n\nBorden was married twice. Her first marriage was to stockbroker Theodore Spector, whom she married on March 28, 1931, in Harrison, New York. The marriage was rocky and the couple separated in early 1932. Borden learned after their separation that Spector was not divorced from his first wife, Pearl, whom he married in 1919. Spector was arrested for bigamy in 1932 after his first wife came forward and claimed they were still married. In November 1932, Borden petitioned the court for an annulment, which was granted on November 22, 1932. She married her second husband, railroad technician John Moeller, in November 1934. That marriage ended in divorce seven years later.\n\nOlive Borden died on October 1, 1947 from a stomach ailment and pneumonia at the age of 41. The only possession she had when she died was a signed photo of herself. Borden's funeral was held on October 3 at the Sunshine Mission home for girls where she had worked and lived since 1945. The mission's founder, Essie Binkley West, officiated the service. Borden was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Her mother was interred in the grave next to her.\n\nFor her contributions to the film industry, Borden has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard. She was one of the first eight stars chosen to receive a star in 1958.\n\n"}

Association football is the most popular discipline and other sports played both professionally and recreatively athletics, auto racing, basketball, boxing, cycling, field hockey, fishing, golf, handball, mountaineering, padel tennis, polo, roller hockey, rowing, rugby union, sailing, skiing, swimming, tennis and volleyball. Argentine achievements can be found in team sports such as association football, basketball, field hockey and rugby union, and individual sports such as boxing, golf, tennis and rowing. Pato, the national sport, is not very popular.\n\nArgentina is one of the most important sport powers in the region, ending at the top of the medal count at the South American Games since 1978, with exceptions in 2002 and 2010. In the all-time medal table of the Pan American Games, Argentina holds first place among South American countries and fourth place in the Americas, behind the United States, Canada and Cuba. Despite a relative lack of success at the Olympic level in more traditional sports like athletics, swimming, and gymnastics, Argentina has had successful participations in other sports like association football, basketball, field hockey, roller hockey, padel tennis, polo and rugby union.\n\nFrom Rallying to Formula One, auto racing is a sport followed by a number of fans in Argentina. Formula One legend Juan Manuel Fangio was five times Formula One world champion under four different teams, winning 102 of his 184 international races, and is widely ranked as the greatest driver of all time. Other distinguished racers were Oscar Alfredo Gálvez, Juan Gálvez, José Froilán González, and Carlos Reutemann. Years after Fangio's career was over, Carlos Reutemann was the best known Argentine driver of the 1970s. More recently José María López has emerged as one of the world's top touring car drivers, winning the World Touring Car Championship in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Argentine competitions include the TC 2000 and Turismo Carretera road racing series, as well as Rally Argentina of the World Rally Championship. Argentina has also hosted the 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 editions of the Dakar Rally. Former events include the defunct Formula One Argentine Grand Prix and World Sportscar Championship's 1000 km Buenos Aires.\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Argentina and part of the country's culture. The sport is played by children during breaks at school and by grown-ups on the plenty of both indoor and outdoor fields located throughout the country.\n\nThe national team has won the FIFA World Cup twice (in 1978 and 1986), successive Olympic gold medals (in 2004 and 2008), fourteen Copas América, one Confederations Cup and six World Youth Championships. Argentine clubs have won the Copa Libertadores, the top continental competition, a record 22 times and the Intercontinental Cup or FIFA Club World Cup 8 times, a record shared with Brazilian clubs. The Argentine Primera División is the top level domestic competition. The country's most famed football idol is Diego Maradona. Actually the most famous football player is Lionel Messi.\n\nArgentina's fiercest rival is Brazil and their rivalry is sometimes known as the \"Battle of the South Americans\". They have played each other numerous times in the Copa América and the Confederations Cup, and their clubs have met several times in the Copa Libertadores finals. Argentina is one of the few national teams in association football that have beaten Brazil on a regular basis. Argentine and Brazilian national youth teams have also met at various tournaments. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, the under-23 teams met in the semi-finals, with Argentina winning 3–0 in a hard-fought game. In addition, the aforementioned Maradona has been often compared with Brazilian iconic player Pelé.\n\nWomen's football is far behind in terms of popularity and professionalism. However, the women's national team has competed in the South American Championship since 1995, finishing as runner-up three times before winning the competition in 2006 with a 5–0 victory over Brazil. The national team also played in the 2003 and the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cups, but they finished last in the group on both occasions.\n\nBasketball is a very popular sport, mostly in the provinces of Argentina. The Basketball Clubs' Association organizes the Liga Nacional de Básquet, the top level league in the country. Although the National team won the first FIBA World Championship in 1950, the sport did not gain country-wide popularity until the 2000s, when the national team conquered the Olympic gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics and had a good performance in the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Championships finishing on the second, fourth and fifth position respectively. The national team also won the bronze medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Argentine NBA star Manu Ginóbili also won NBA Championship rings in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014 as a member of the San Antonio Spurs, the 2007 victory included his compatriot Fabricio Oberto.\n\nThe National team has won the 2001 Tournament of the Americas and the 2011 FIBA Americas Championship.\n\nAlthough women's basketball is not professional in Argentina, the national team participates in most international competitions, reaching their highest point at the 2006 FIBA World Championship for Women where they finished in the 9th place.\n\nRugby union is a popular and largely amateur sport. However, despite this amateurism, the national team have become one of the most powerful in the sport, finishing third in the 2007 Rugby World Cup and rising as high as third in the World Rugby Rankings (then known as the IRB World Rankings) immediately after. Since November 2004, Argentina have picked up at least one win over all the participants in Europe's Six Nations Championship, drawn with the British and Irish Lions and narrowly lost to the All Blacks, who were forced to survive a last-second assault on their try line. In particular, the \"Pumas\" have enjoyed a dominating record in recent years against France, going 7–2 since 2000, with a total points against of 7.\n\nFor the first 20 years of the sport's professional era, dating from 1996, most important Argentine players have emigrated to Europe (mainly to England and France). Probably the best known players are 1970s and 1980s star Hugo Porta; Agustín Pichot, Pumas captain during their 2007 World Cup run and now the vice chairman of World Rugby; his successor as captain, Felipe Contepomi; current star utility back Juan Martín Hernández; 1990s star and later Pumas head coach Santiago Phelan; Marcelo Loffreda, who coached the team during their 2007 World Cup run before leaving to take up the coaching post at English club power Leicester Tigers; and current head coach Daniel Hourcade.\n\nIn 2012, Argentina joined New Zealand, Australia and South Africa in the Tri Nations Championship, which then became The Rugby Championship. In 2014, Argentina took their first victory in this competition against Australia in the first round. Argentina further cemented its links with SANZAAR when the country was added to that body's Super Rugby competition, which added teams based in Argentina and Japan in 2016.\n\nTennis has been quite popular among people of all ages since the 1970s, after both Guillermo Vilas and later Gabriela Sabatini in the 1980s reached the number 2 position and won several Grand Slams. Even though no Argentine player has thus far reached the first place at the ATP Rankings, many Argentines have been among the most important in the circuit. During the 2000s a number of Argentine players were among the top 10 and the 2004 French Open featured an all-Argentine final. Gastón Gaudio won the Roland Garros in 2004. At the 2005 Tennis Masters Cup, David Nalbandian defeated world number 1 Roger Federer and the tournament gathered 4 Argentine players, an all-time record for any nationality. Most recently, Juan Martín del Potro has emerged as one of the leading players in the world, having won the 2009 US Open a few days before his 21st birthday. Argentina has won the World Team Cup four times, in 1980, 2002, 2007 and 2010 and has reached the semifinals of the Davis Cup 7 times in the last 10 years, losing the finals against Russia in 2006 and Spain in 2008 and 2011; the Argentine team also played the final in 1981, where they lost against the United States.

The national team won the World Cup in 2002 and 2010. At the Olympic Games, it won the silver medal in 2000 and 2012, as well as bronze in 2004 and 2008. \"Las Leonas\" also won the annual Champions Trophy on seven occasions, in 2001, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016 and the World League 2014-2015. Luciana Aymar is recognized as the best female player in the history of the sport, being the only player to have received the FIH Player of the Year Award eight times.\n\nThe men's national team \"Los Leones\" won the gold medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics and the bronze medal at the 2014 World Cup and 2008 Champions Trophy. The national squad also won Pan American Games on nine occasions and the 2005, 2007 and 2012 Champions Challenges.\n\nRink hockey is mainly played in the Cuyo region (especially in San Juan Province). Argentine players have an international quality, with the men's national team winning five Rink Hockey World Championship titles. The women's national team is the world's most successful team, having won five titles.\n\nPascual Pérez was Argentina's first world boxing champion.

Argentine boxers have, as of 2004, earned 24 Olympic medals, including seven gold medals.\n\nArgentine boxer Victor Galindez was the third Latin American to win the world's Light-Heavyweight title (after Puerto Rico's José Torres and Venezuela's Vicente Rondon, WBA-recognized champion during the middle of the 1970s). Galindez died after he was run over by a car during an auto racing competition in which he took part.\n\nIn 1994, WBA world Middleweight champion Jorge Castro knocked out John David Jackson in the ninth round to retain his title in Monterrey, Mexico. Since Castro was on the brink of suffering a technical knockout loss when he won the fight, the punch with which he beat Jackson has become known as boxing's version of Diego Maradona's Hand of God goal.\n\nMarcela Acuña is a world champion female boxer, and arguably one of the most popular fighters of the 2000s in Argentina.\n\nOther fighters, such as Oscar Bonavena, Juan Roldán, and Luis Firpo, did not win world championships, but were also popular among boxing fans during their years as professional fighters.\n\nOn 17 April 2010, Sergio Martínez outpointed American Kelly Pavlik in Atlantic City to become the lineal Middleweight champion of the world.\n\nMarcos René Maidana has also been champion in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.\n\nPadel tennis is played by four and a half million amateur players in thirty five thousand courts; it is the most participated sport in Argentina. Professional players compete in National Circuit of tournaments. Argentina won 17 titles at the Padel Tennis World Championship (between women and men).\n\nArgentina's polo team won their first Olympic gold medal in 1924 and the second gold medal in 1936. Adolfo Cambiaso, Gonzalo Pieres, his brother Facundo, the Novillo Astrada brothers, the Heguy's, and Tommy Iriarte are currently ranked amongst the best polo players in the world. The three most important polo tournaments in the world, the Argentine Open, the Hurlingham Open, and the Tortugas Open are held in Argentina. Historically, Argentina has always been a leading country in this sport, and has been uninterrupted world champions since 1949 and Argentine players comprise most of the world's top ten players. Argentina has won five World Polo Championship.\n\nAmong the best in South America, the first prominent figure of this sport in Argentina was José Jurado. He was the first Argentine to travel to major international championships and is thus often credited as the \"Father of Argentine Professional Golf\".\n\nOther notable Argentine golfers include Roberto De Vicenzo, Antonio Cerdá, José Cóceres, Eduardo Romero, Ángel Cabrera, Andrés Romero and Ricardo González. De Vicenzo and Cerdá won the 1953 Canada Cup. In history, Argentine golfers won three Majors, Roberto De Vicenzo the British Open in 1967, and Ángel Cabrera the U.S. Open in 2007 and the Augusta Masters in 2009.\n\nArgentina won 10 Olympic medals in sailing (1 gold, 4 silver, 5 bronze), the Argentinian experience and level in this sport is high, even between young children competing in optimist class boats. Carlos Espínola is the sailor who won most Olympic medals in this sport with four. Santiago Lange won the World Championship on four occasions (1985, 1993, 1995 and 2004) and the gold medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nAlthough handball in Argentina lacks the popularity of this sport on the European continent, both in terms of infrastructure and federated players, the Handball is a firmly growing sport in Argentina with the men's national team regularly qualifying for the World Championship. Argentina has started producing world class talent, such as the brothers Diego and Sebastián Simonet.\n\nThe Men's national handball team won the gold medal at the 2011 Pan American Games and seven Pan American Handball Championships.\n\nVolleyball has a professional male league. Argentina national volleyball team's best achievements are the bronze medals at the 1988 Summer Olympics and 1982 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship.

The female team is less important internationally than its male counterpart.\n\nCricket has been played in Argentina since 1806, with the international side making its first appearance in 1868, against the Uruguay national team. The sport regained some popularity, due to the national team's participation at the World Cricket League, and the Argentina national women's cricket team at the Women's version of the ICC Americas Championship. Though cricket is a minor sport, Argentina is the strongest team in mainland South America, and are currently playing in division 1777 of the World Cricket League. There is a huge scope of development of the sport in this country, given that there are a large number of British descendants in Argentina. Argentina dominated the South American Cricket Championship.\n\nArgentina was one of eight founding members of the International Olympic Committee, and first participated in the Olympic Games in 1900 with one single athlete. Argentine Olympic competitors have, from 1900 to 2016, garnered 74 medals (21 gold, 25 silver, 28 bronze); from 1924 to 1952, its athletes had good showings, giving the Argentine delegations global ranks of between 16th and 19th.

The game was released for Windows in July 2003.\n\nOn September 9, 2014, Invictus announced via their Facebook page that the \"Street Legal\" franchise, as well as every other game Invictus had developed using that game engine was now abandonware, and the engine, along with all the art assets, were for sale.\n\nThe game takes place in Valo City (possibly a play on the word \"velocity\"), a metropolis known for its vast underworld of illegal street racing. The plot of the game is to beat every club and accomplish the requirements to enter the Race of Champions, a prestigious racing competition where one can win a bonus car. Players have to race others on the streets during the day for prestige (respect) or money to customize the car. During the night, players can either participate in a drag race against another driver or watch the race. And also the newly added race tracks that allows the player to race their own vehicles against AI's on a race track to win a prize.\n\nA unique feature of the game is its detailed level of customization for the vehicles. The player can buy a completely new car from the dealership, a used one from a local shop where they were already customized or even totaled, or build the car from scratch with a chassis. Unlike a traditional street racing video game if the player crashes their car the consequences are very real and must \"manually\" replace each part that got destroyed in the crash.\n\nCurrently, there are three patches for the game: the 2.2.1 MWM (by Miran & Wichur), 2.3.0 Live Edition (by Raxat) and SLRR2015 (by Bigg Boss93, available on VStanced.com). The latest version (2.3.1) was released on Steam and is gradually improved by the Russian game developer ImageCode in collaboration with Raxat.\n\nThousands of mods were made for this game, including vehicles, parts for said vehicles, tracks (Some mods only work on the 2.2.1 MWM version), sounds, menu interfaces, and textures. Because some of the versions of the game are highly unstable, it is highly likely to crash when too many mods are installed mainly on the 2.2.1 and 2.3.0 versions.\n\nThanks to public funding, the game was greenlit and eventually re-released on Steam on May 7th, 2016. The Steam release was very unstable when it first launched, but is gradually improving. Its textures and interface make it more contemporary, and the career is altered for more of a challenge.\n\nDave Singh, the owner of streetlegalmods.com, made a deal with Invictus Games, Ltd. stating that if the Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign reached a minimum of $150,000, the development of the sequel to \"SLRR\", \"Street Tuning Evolution\", would officially begin, as long as the game was playable and the community was allowed to add content. $500,000 was demanded to make a complete game.\n\nAfter having a bad launch with the Kickstarter, and due to the popular demand of a PayPal option, Invictus Games, Ltd. and Dave Singh decided to move the campaign to IndieGogo to solve the many problems, and also to extend the deadline. Backers could then use PayPal to make a pledge. The campaign would have been funded only if it had reached $150,000. The IndieGogo campaign had a significantly better launch than the Kickstarter campaign, which raised around $24,000 a little more than 40 days after its launch in December 18, 2014. The IndieGogo campaign raised nearly $10,000 just one day after its launch. Unfortunately the campaign failed, reaching just over $30,000.\n\nDespite the failure, another person, Bartosz \"Wichur\" Bieszka, plans to make a sequel to this game under the \"Car Tune\" title. ImageCode LLC is also working on a similar project also being called Street Tuning Evolution which means the game is still very much alive which will be a sequel to Street Legal Racing Redline.\n"}

Marasigan criticized \"Praybeyt Benjamin\" for \"unashamedly made for profit\". He also described the film as \"cheap, tacky and absolutely nonsensical. But say what you might about the film's level of intellectualism (or lack thereof), it is at least honest about its intentions\". Marasigan however acknowledged that the film fulfilled its purpose, to primarily entertain its target audience.\n\nBubbles Salvador at the Philippine Entertainment Portal, has a more positive review for the film. While Salvador took note of one loophole in the plot of the film - namely the lack of resolution between Bimbee and his father, with the former feeling unloved by the latter, Salvador described Praybeyt Benjamin 2 as \"worth of one's couple of hours at the cinema this holiday season, if one is not looking for a lesson in history, a love story, or a good scare, and would settle for a light and funny action comedy\".\n"}

Herman and Lily have a son, Eddie, who is a werewolf, and their niece, Marilyn, also lives with them.\n\n\n\nThis color revival of \"The Munsters\" starred John Schuck (Herman), Lee Meriwether (Lily), Howard Morton (Grandpa), Hilary Van Dyke (Marilyn) and Jason Marsden (Eddie), and broadcast 73 episodes from October 8, 1988, to May 25, 1991, giving it more first-run episodes than the original series. The pilot explained the 22-year gap following the original series by showing the family as they were in 1966 when an accident took place; the family then proceeds to wake up in 1988.\n\nIt was created following a failed attempt to revive the show with most of the original cast (Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis and Yvonne De Carlo) in the 1981 NBC telefilm \"The Munsters' Revenge\". In the living room set, there are photos of the original casts sitting on the mantle of the fireplace. \n\n\n\nThe series lasted three seasons on syndicated television, and proved popular with international audiences. \n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1976 (incorporated 1979) by Artistic Director Catherine Turocy and Ann Jacoby. With a mission to recreate and preserve the full range of 17th and 18th century dances (operas, court balls, salon performances and street shows) the New York Baroque Dance company also serves the community with educational programs for all levels, from elementary school to university, as well as programs for the general public.\n\nThe NYBDC has performed with many leading early music specialists, including John Eliot Gardiner, Christopher Hogwood, Nicholas McGegan and Wolfgang Katschner and ensembles that include Opera Lafayette Orchestra and Chorus, The Dallas Bach Society, Mercury Baroque, Apollo's Fire and Philharmonia Baroque. In New York City, the company produces annual performances with Concert Royal Orchestra.\n\nImportant productions have included Jean Philippe Rameau's \"Les Boréades\" (never performed in the 18th century) and Hippolyte et Aricie at the Aix-en-Provence Festival and the Opera de Lyon; Henry Purcell's \"Indian Queen\" at London's Barbican; Scylla et Glaucus by Jean Marie Leclair at the Opera de Lyon as well as more than one hundred performances of a double bill of Rameau's \"Pygmalion\" and Handel's \"Terpsicore\". At the International Handel Festival in Göttingen, Germany the company has performed many of that composer's works, including \"Ariodante\", \"Arianna in Creta\", \"Alcina\", \"Atalanta\", \"Orlando\", \"Terpsicore\" and \"Teseo\".\n\nAfter studying ballet and dance history at Ohio State University with Shirley Wynne, Turocy and six other dancers formed the Baroque Dance Ensemble which folded in 1975. Turocy relocated to New York City and formed a new company with Ann Jacoby (who had previously danced with the Baroque Dance Ensemble) as The New York Baroque Dance Co. Turocy had met harpsichordist and conductor James Richman at the Aston Magna Music Festival in 1974, where they were collaborating on music of Rameau, and the two eventually married. Richman later founded the Concert Royal Orchestra, whose performances date back to their 1977 Carnegie Hall debut, and with whom the New York Baroque Dance company has frequently collaborated since their 1977 recreation of dances by Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Féry Rebel (\"Les Caracteres de la Danse\") and the complete the dance scene from Rameau's pastoral masque, \"Les Fetes d'Hebe\" at Alice Tully Hall.\n\nIn 1997, to celebrate the company's 20th anniversary, The New York Public Library presented the exhibition: \"The New Baroque: Early Dance Re-creations and Inspirations.\" Ms. Turocy has taught historical performance at the Juilliard School and (with the New York Baroque Dance Company) has been a guest teacher at the Early Music Institute at Indiana University, Oberlin College, Curtis Institute of Music and Case Western Reserve. She directed Mozarts’s \"The Magic Flute\" at the University of Miami in 2013 and is a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.\n\nWith the New York Baroque Dance Company, Turocy won the 2018 Isadora Duncan Dance Award for Outstanding Revival at the 32nd annual \"Izzie\" Awards for the reconstruction of Rameau's 1745 opera-ballet \"Le Temple de la Gloire\" with the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra & Chorus (sharing the award with Krissy Keefer and Dance Brigade's “The Great Liberation Upon Hearing”). This work had previously been presented by NYBDC and Concert Royal at Florence Gould Hall in 1991. For her work with the company, Turocy won the 2001 Bessie Award for Sustained Achievement in Choreography.\n\n"}
{"id": "20647654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20647654", "title": "Trickster", "text": "Trickster\n\nIn mythology, and in the study of folklore and religion, a trickster is a character in a story (god, goddess, spirit, man, woman, or anthropomorphisation), which exhibits a great degree of intellect or secret knowledge, and uses it to play tricks or otherwise disobey normal rules and conventional behaviour.\n\nTricksters are archetypal characters who appear in the myths of many different cultures. Lewis Hyde describes the trickster as a \"boundary-crosser\". The trickster crosses and often breaks both physical and societal rules. Tricksters \"...violate principles of social and natural order, playfully disrupting normal life and then re-establishing it on a new basis.\"\n\nOften, the bending/breaking of rules takes the form of tricks or thievery. Tricksters can be cunning or foolish or both. The trickster openly questions and mocks authority. They are usually male characters, and are fond of breaking rules, boasting, and playing tricks on both humans and gods.\n\nAll cultures have tales of the trickster, a crafty creature who uses cunning to get food, steal precious possessions, or simply cause mischief. In some Greek myths Hermes plays the trickster. He is the patron of thieves and the inventor of lying, a gift he passed on to Autolycus, who in turn passed it on to Odysseus. In Slavic folktales, the trickster and the culture hero are often combined.\n\nFrequently the trickster figure exhibits gender and form variability. In Norse mythology the mischief-maker is Loki, who is also a shape shifter. Loki also exhibits gender variability, in one case even becoming pregnant. He becomes a mare who later gives birth to Odin's eight-legged horse Sleipnir.\n\nBritish scholar Evan Brown suggested that Jacob in the Bible has many of the characteristics of the trickster:The tricks Jacob plays on his twin brother Esau, his father Isaac and his father-in-law Laban are immoral by conventional standards, designed to cheat other people and gain material and social advantages he is not entitled to. Nevertheless, the Biblical narrative clearly takes Jacob's side and the reader is invited to laugh and admire Jacob's ingenuity–as is the case with the tricksters of other cultures\".\n\nIn a wide variety of African language communities, the rabbit, or hare, is the trickster. In West Africa (and thence into the Caribbean via the slave trade), the spider (Anansi) is often the trickster.\n\nThe trickster or clown is an example of a Jungian archetype. In modern literature the trickster survives as a character archetype, not necessarily supernatural or divine, sometimes no more than a stock character. Often too, the trickster is distinct in a story by his acting as a sort of catalyst, in that his antics are the cause of other characters' discomfiture, but he himself is left untouched. A once-famous example of this was the character Froggy the Gremlin on the early children's television show \"Andy's Gang\". A cigar-puffing puppet, Froggy induced the adult humans around him to engage in ridiculous and self-destructive hi-jinks.\n\nIn later folklore, the trickster/clown is incarnated as a clever, mischievous man or creature, who tries to survive the dangers and challenges of the world using trickery and deceit as a defense. He also is known for entertaining people as a clown does. For example, many typical fairy tales have the king who wants to find the best groom for his daughter by ordering several trials. No brave and valiant prince or knight manages to win them, until a poor and simple peasant comes. With the help of his wits and cleverness, instead of fighting, he evades or fools monsters and villains and dangers with unorthodox manners. Therefore, the most unlikely candidate passes the trials and receives the reward. More modern and obvious examples of that type include Bugs Bunny and Pippi Longstocking.\n\nModern African American literary criticism has turned the trickster figure into an example of how it is possible to overcome a system of oppression from within. For years, African American literature was discounted by the greater community of American literary criticism while its authors were still obligated to use the language and the rhetoric of the very system that relegated African Americans and other minorities to the ostracized position of the cultural \"other.\" The central question became one of how to overcome this system when the only words available were created and defined by the oppressors. As Audre Lorde explained, the problem was that \"the master's tools [would] never dismantle the master's house.\"\n\nIn his writings of the late 1980s, Henry Louis Gates Jr. presents the concept of Signifyin'. Wound up in this theory is the idea that the \"master's house\" can be \"dismantled\" using his \"tools\" if the tools are used in a new or unconventional way. To demonstrate this process, Gates cites the interactions found in African American narrative poetry between the trickster, the Signifying Monkey, and his oppressor, the Lion. According to Gates, the \"Signifying Monkey\" is the \"New World figuration\" and \"functional equivalent\" of the Eshu trickster figure of African Yoruba mythology. The Lion functions as the authoritative figure in his classical role of \"King of the Jungle.\" He is the one who commands the Signifying Monkey's movements. Yet the Monkey is able to outwit the Lion continually in these narratives through his usage of figurative language. According to Gates, \"[T]he Signifying Monkey is able to signify upon the Lion because the Lion does not understand the Monkey's discourse…The monkey speaks figuratively, in a symbolic code; the lion interprets or reads literally and suffers the consequences of his folly...\" In this way, the Monkey uses the same language as the Lion, but he uses it on a level that the Lion cannot comprehend. This usually leads to the Lion's \"trounc[ing]\" at the hands of a third party, the Elephant. The net effect of all of this is \"the reversal of [the Lion's] status as the King of the Jungle.\" In this way, the \"master's house\" is dismantled when his own tools are turned against him.\nFollowing in this tradition, critics since Gates have come to assert that another popular African American folk trickster, Br'er Rabbit (a contraction of \"Brother Rabbit\"), uses clever language to perform the same kind of rebellious societal deconstruction as the Signifying Monkey. Brer Rabbit is the \"creative way that the slave community responded to the oppressor's failure to address them as human beings created in the image of God.\" The figurative representative of this slave community, Brer Rabbit is the hero with a \"fragile body but a deceptively strong mind\" that allows him to \"create [his] own symbols in defiance of the perverted logic of the oppressor.\" By twisting language to create these symbols, Brer Rabbit not only was the \"personification of the ethic of self-preservation\" for the slave community, but also \"an alternative response to their oppressor's false doctrine of anthropology.\" Through his language of trickery, Brer Rabbit outwits his oppressors, deconstructing, in small ways, the hierarchy of subjugation to which his weak body forces him to physically conform.\n\nBefore Gates, there was some precedent for the analysis of African American folk heroes as destructive agents of an oppressive hierarchical system. In the 1920s and 1930s, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound engaged in an epistolary correspondence. Both writers signed the letters with pseudonyms adopted from the Uncle Remus tales; Eliot was \"Possum;\" Pound was \"Tar Baby.\" Pound and Eliot wrote in the same \"African slave\" dialect of the tales. Pound, writing later of the series of letters, distinguished the language from \"the Queen's English, the language of public propriety.\" This rebellion against proper language came as part of \"collaboration\" between Pound and Eliot \"against the London literary establishment and the language that it used.\" Although Pound and Eliot were not attempting to overthrow an establishment as expansive as the one oppressing the African American slave community, they were actively trying to establish for themselves a new kind of literary freedom. In their usage of the Uncle Remus trickster figures' names and dialects, they display an early understanding of the way in which cleverly manipulated language can dismantle a restrictive hierarchy.\n\nAfrican American literary criticism and folktales are not the only place in the American literary tradition that tricksters are to be found combating subjugation from within an oppressive system. In \"When Brer Rabbit Meets Coyote\", the argument is posited that the Brer Rabbit stories were derived from a mixture of African and Native American mythology, thus attributing part of the credit for the formation of the tales and wiles of Brer Rabbit to \"Indian captivity narratives\" and the rabbit trickster found in Cherokee mythology. In arguing for a merged \"African–Native American folklore\", the idea is forwarded that certain shared \"cultural affinities\" between African Americans and Native Americans allowed both groups \"through the trickster tales…survive[d] European American cultural and political domination.\"\n\nWhile the trickster crosses various cultural traditions, there are significant differences between tricksters in the traditions of different parts of the world:\n\nMany native traditions held clowns and tricksters as essential to any contact with the sacred. People could not pray until they had laughed, because laughter opens and frees from rigid preconception. Humans had to have tricksters within the most sacred ceremonies for fear that they forget the sacred comes through upset, reversal, surprise. The trickster in most native traditions is essential to creation, to birth.\n\nNative American tricksters should not be confused with the European fictional picaro. One of the most important distinctions is that \"we can see in the Native American trickster an openness to life's multiplicity and paradoxes largely missing in the modern Euro-American moral tradition\". In some stories the Native American trickster is foolish and other times wise. He can be a hero in one tale and a villain in the next.\n\nIn many Native American and First Nations mythologies, the Coyote spirit (Southwestern United States) or Raven spirit (Pacific Northwest) stole fire from the gods (stars, moon, and/or sun). Both are usually seen as jokesters and pranksters. In Native American creation stories, when Coyote teaches humans how to catch salmon, he makes the first fish weir out of logs and branches.\n\nWakdjunga in Winnebago mythology is an example of the trickster archetype.\n\nThe Coyote mythos is one of the most popular among western Native American cultures, especially among indigenous peoples of California and the Great Basin.\n\nAccording to Crow (and other Plains) tradition, Old Man Coyote impersonates the Creator: \"Old Man Coyote took up a handful of mud and out of it made people\". He also bestowed names on buffalo, deer, elk, antelopes, and bear. According to A. Hultkranz, the impersonation of Coyote as Creator is a result of a taboo, a mythic substitute to the religious notion of the Great Spirit whose name was too dangerous and/or sacred to use apart from at special ceremonies.\n\nIn Chelan myths, Coyote belongs to the animal people but he is at the same time \"a power just like the Creator, the head of all the creatures.\" while still being a subject of the Creator who can punish him or remove his powers. In the Pacific Northwest tradition, Coyote is mostly mentioned as a messenger, or minor power.\n\nAs the culture hero, Coyote appears in various mythic traditions, but generally with the same magical powers of transformation, resurrection, and \"medicine\". He is engaged in changing the ways of rivers, creating new landscapes and getting sacred things for people. Of mention is the tradition of Coyote fighting against monsters. According to Wasco tradition, Coyote was the hero to fight and kill Thunderbird, the killer of people, but he could do that not because of his personal power, but due to the help of the Spirit Chief. In some stories, Multnomah Falls came to be by Coyote's efforts; in others, it is done by Raven.\n\nMore often than not Coyote is a trickster, but always different. In some stories, he is a noble trickster: \"Coyote takes water from the Frog people... because it is not right that one people have all the water.\" In others, he is malicious: \"Coyote determined to bring harm to Duck. He took Duck's wife and children, whom he treated badly.\"\n\nIn online environments there has been a link between the trickster and Internet trolling. Some have said that a trickster is a type of online community character.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "106089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=106089", "title": "Who's on First?", "text": "Who's on First?\n\n\"Who's on First?\" is a comedy routine made famous by Abbott and Costello. The premise of the sketch is that Abbott is identifying the players on a baseball team for Costello, but their names and nicknames can be interpreted as non-responsive answers to Costello's questions. For example, the first baseman is named \"Who\"; thus, the utterance \"Who's on first\" is ambiguous between the question (\"Which person is the first baseman?\") and the answer (\"The name of the first baseman is 'Who).\n\n\"Who's on First?\" is descended from turn-of-the-century burlesque sketches that used plays on words and names. Examples are \"The Baker Scene\" (the shop is located on Watt Street) and \"Who Dyed\" (the owner is named \"Who\"). In the 1930 movie \"Cracked Nuts\", comedians Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey examine a map of a mythical kingdom with dialogue like this: \"What is next to Which.\" \"What is the name of the town next to Which?\" \"Yes.\" In British music halls, comedian Will Hay performed a routine in the early 1930s (and possibly earlier) as a schoolmaster interviewing a schoolboy named Howe who came from Ware but now lives in Wye. By the early 1930s, a \"Baseball Routine\" had become a standard bit for burlesque comics across the United States. Abbott's wife recalled him performing the routine with another comedian before teaming with Costello.\n\nBud Abbott stated that it was taken from an older routine called \"Who's The Boss?\", a performance of which can be heard in an episode of the radio comedy program \"It Pays to Be Ignorant\" from the 1940s. After they formally teamed up in burlesque in 1936, he and Costello continued to hone the sketch. It was a big hit in 1937, when they performed the routine in a touring vaudeville revue called \"Hollywood Bandwagon\".\n\nIn February 1938, Abbott and Costello joined the cast of \"The Kate Smith Hour\" radio program, and the sketch was first performed for a national radio audience on March 24 of that year. The routine may have been further polished before this broadcast by burlesque producer John Grant, who became the team's writer, and Will Glickman, a staff writer on the radio show. Glickman may have added the nicknames of then-contemporary baseball players like Dizzy and Daffy Dean to set up the routine's premise. This version, with extensive wordplay based on the fact that most of the fictional baseball team's players had \"strange nicknames\" that seemed to be questions, became known as \"Who's on First?\" Some versions continue with references to Enos Slaughter, which Costello misunderstands as \"He knows\" Slaughter. By 1944, Abbott and Costello had the routine copyrighted.\n\nAbbott and Costello performed \"Who's on First?\" numerous times in their careers, rarely performing it exactly the same way twice. They did the routine for President Franklin Roosevelt several times. An abridged version was featured in the team's 1940 film debut, \"One Night in the Tropics\". The duo reprised the bit in their 1945 film \"The Naughty Nineties\", and it is that longer version which is considered their finest recorded rendition. They also performed \"Who's on First?\" numerous times on radio and television (notably in \"The Abbott and Costello Show\" episode \"The Actor's Home\", widely considered the definitive version).\n\nIn 1956, a gold record of \"Who's on First?\" was placed in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. A video (taken from \"The Naughty Nineties\") now plays continuously on screens at the Hall.\n\nIn the 1970s, Selchow and Righter published a \"Who's on First?\" board game.\n\nIn 1999, \"Time\" named the routine Best Comedy Sketch of the 20th Century.\n\nAn early radio recording was placed in the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry in 2003.\n\nIn 2005, the line \"Who's on First?\" was included on the American Film Institute's list of 100 memorable movie quotations.\n\nThe names given in the routine for the players at each position are:\n\nThe name of the shortstop is not given until the very end of the routine, and the right fielder is never identified. In the Selchow and Righter board game, the right fielder's name is \"Nobody\".\n\nAt one point in the routine, Costello thinks that the first baseman is named Naturally:\n\nAbbott's explanations leave Costello hopelessly confused and infuriated, until the end of the routine when Costello appears to parody Abbott by saying what appears to be gibberish to him, incidentally getting it right:\n\nThat is the most commonly heard ending. \"I Don't Care\" and \"I Don't Give a \"Damn\"\" have also turned up on occasion, depending on the perceived sensibilities of the audience.\n\nThe skit was usually performed on the team's radio series at the start of the baseball season. In one instance it serves as a climax for a broadcast which begins with Costello receiving a telegram from Joe DiMaggio asking Costello to take over for him due to his injury. (In this case, the unidentified right fielder would have been Costello himself. While Joe DiMaggio was best known as a center fielder, when Abbott and Costello honed the sketch in 1936-7, Joe DiMaggio had played a number of games at right field (20 in 1936).)\n\nWriting credits for the sketch are unknown though, over the years, numerous people have claimed or been given credit for it. Such claims typically lack reasonable corroboration. For example, a 1993 obituary of comedy sketch writer Michael J. Musto states that, shortly after Abbott and Costello teamed up, they paid Musto $15 to write the script. Furthermore, several 1996 obituaries of songwriter Irving Gordon mention that he had written the sketch.\n\nThe sketch has been reprised, updated, alluded to, and parodied innumerable times over the decades in all forms of media. Some notable examples include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Zoobomb began in 2002.\nParticipants carry their bikes on MAX Light Rail to the Washington Park station next to the Oregon Zoo. From there, participants take the elevator to the surface and then ride their bikes down the hills in the vicinity. This process is often repeated several times throughout the night.\n\nThere is an emphasis on unusual bicycles, first and foremost the children's bicycles or \"minibikes,\" but extending to tall bikes, swing bike, choppers, non-functional bicycles, skateboards, longboards, etc.\nThe Zoobombers are made up of a wide demographic, with a tendency towards young adults. The event is treated in a very lighthearted fashion, including a large amount of socializing between rides. Riders often dress up in costume or decorate their bicycles. Parents have brought their children on rides, and a legally blind person \"The Blind Bomber\" regularly attends (on a tandem bike, behind a sighted rider). Though not technically a race, there is some prestige in getting down the hill first. However, there is never shame in getting down the hill last, as safety and fun are what is encouraged, not going fast. The participants espouse a \"pack it in, pack it out/leave no trace\" philosophy in an effort to maintain cleanliness in the areas where they congregate. Zoobomb tries to be a positive force in the community by providing a safe environment to have a good time and to support bicycle advocacy and alternative non-polluting transportation.\n\nThough many riders bring their own bicycles, the participants maintain a \"Zoobomb pile\". This is a tower of minibikes anchored to a bicycle rack at the Zoobomb meeting point. These are spare bikes that are used as loaners for would-be Zoobombers who don't have their own bike. The pile has become a local landmark.\n\nIn March 2009, a new pile was dedicated, in a ceremony attended by Portland mayor Sam Adams. The new pile is located at SW 13th and Burnside.\n\nThere are several annual events hosted by Zoobomb organizers and participants, including:\n\nZoobomb has inspired Hoodbomb, where participants gather at the Timberline Lodge and bomb the course of Timberline Road on Mount Hood.\n\n\n"}
