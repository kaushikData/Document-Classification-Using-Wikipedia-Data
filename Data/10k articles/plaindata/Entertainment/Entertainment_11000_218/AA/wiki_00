Pre-publicity for these championship match broadcasts was given in ITV's nationally published listings magazine TVTimes\n\nA British Welterweight Championship was first set up in 1938 under All-In rules and won by Harold Angus. The Mountevans Committee in 1947 called for the establishment of a British Welterweight Title and so recognised the still-incumbent All In titleholder Angus as champion. This lineage was recognised by Joint Promotions following its 1952 formation. The title would later be transplanted to All Star Wrestling following champion Danny Collins' defection in the late 1980s, where it would remain active until the mid-1990s. In the 21st century, revivals of the title have been hosted by The Wrestling Alliance in 2000-2003 and Revolution British Wrestling in 2003-2005 before most recently being contested for in LDN's Academy/Spirit League since 2006. \n\nThe title first became recognised by RBW in August 2003, when a decider contest was held between Spud and Jack Hazard which saw Spud crowned RBW's first British Welterweight Champion.

Regulation of the game can be done completely by a computer or partly deferred to a human referee. Computer-assisted gaming attempts to combine the advantages of PC games with those of face-to-face games. In computer-assisted gaming, computers are used for recordkeeping and sometimes for the resolution of combat, but a Human referee makes any decisions requiring judgement.\n\nA computer-assisted game can be little more than a collection of rules and notes on computer, or as complete as a computer game, with a human referee needed only to make the non-random decisions. It can be played remotely or with everyone in the same room looking at one or more computer monitors. (The referee must have his own monitor; the players can share one, or each player can have his own. Or only the referee may have a monitor, with the players using paper as usual.) This flexibility allows players to combine the best aspects of paper-and-pencil and computer games while computerizing the game as much or as little as desired.\nComputer-assisted games are mostly not designed toward recreating the battlefield inside computer memory, but employing the computer to play the role of game master by storing game rules and unit (wargames) or role (role playing games) characteristics, tracking unit or character status and positions or distances, animating the game with sounds and voice and resolving combat (shooting and close combat). All distance relationships are tracked on the tabletop. All record-keeping is tracked by the computer.\n\nRole-playing games were one of the first types of games for which computer-assisted gaming programs were developed. Computer-aided role-playing game programs are designed to help game masters and players alike. Those programs range from acting as convenient format for a character sheet; or other game materials; all the way up to full automation of the game mechanics of a role-playing game system . This is especially useful for character creation/maintenance and rules resolutions for complex simulationist games.\n\nThere are multiple poker tools that allow players to do statistical analysis of games. An example is a poker calculator, which determines the player's probability of winning, losing, or tying a hand.\n\nAnother example of computer-assisted gaming growing in popularity among role-playing game players is the use of a digital projector or flat screen monitors to present maps or other visual elements during game play. These elements may be used on their own, or in concert with miniatures to map out combats, and exploration or to introduce other visual media into the game without resorting to printing or drawing these items.;\n\n Webcam enabled computer-assisted wargames use computer vision to process firing with images of the camera. In the case of an external USB camera, it is placed behind the firing unit selected (third person shooter) in the direction of the target. When a tablet is used the rear webcam is selected. Precise positioning of the webcam behind the shooting unit is not required : it is sufficient both the shooting unit and the target unit are displayed on the captured image for the shot to be valid. This makes the usage of a tablet very practical for these games. Target detection algorithms (improved magic wand contour, polygon simplification, convex hull algorithms, polygon degree of convexity) allow to analyze the characteristics of the target and to estimate the distance to the target. Damage is computed by taking into the account distance (in distance units) between the firing unit and the target, the type of gun (anti-tank value) of the firing unit and the thickness of the armor of the target (defend value).\n\n"}

She was also the wife of celebrated Dadaist Hugo Ball. Despite her own achievements, it is difficult to come by information in English about Hennings that is not directly related to her relationship with Hugo Ball. Several biographies of Hennings have been published in German.\n\nHennings was born in Flensburg, German Empire, describing herself later as \"a seaman's child\".\n\nAfter the end of her first marriage in 1906, Hennings was an itinerant performer, travelling over much of the European continent. She was a performer at the Cabaret Simplizissimus in Munich, when she met Ball in 1913.\n\nAt the time, Hennings was already a published poet, whose works had appeared in left-wing publications called \"Pan\" and \"Die Aktion\". In 1913 she also published a short poetry collection called \"Ether Poems\", or \"Äthergedichte\" in German. Later, Hennings was a collaborator to the magazine \"Revolution\", which was founded by Ball and Hans Leybold.\n\nHennings and Ball moved to Zurich in 1915, where they took part in the founding of the Cabaret Voltaire, which marked the beginning of the Dada movement. Hennings was a regular performer at the Cabaret Voltaire. Her performances included a role in \"Das Leben des Menschen\" (the Life of a Man), in which she appeared with Ball. This was the German premiere of the play by Leonid Andreev. Hennings also performed in a piece written by Ball, called \"Krippenspiel\". After the Cabaret Voltaire ended, Hennings and Ball toured, performing mostly in hotels. Hennings sang, did puppetry, and danced to music composed by Ball. She also recited her own poetry. In 1916 Ball and Hennings created Arabella, their own ensemble troupe, where Hennings performed under the name Dagny. Hennings married Ball on 21 February 1920. Although they had no children together, Hennings had a daughter, Annemarie, from a previous relationship. Hennings, who outlived Ball by two decades, lived in Magliaso, Switzerland from 1942 to 1948. She died at a clinic in Sorengo, Switzerland.\n\nIn \"The Magic Bishop: Hugo Ball, Dada Poet\", author Erdmute Wenzel White writes that Hennings “was admired by expressionists as the incarnation of the cabaret artist of her time... The shining star of the Voltaire, according to the \"Zuricher Post\" (Zurich Post), her role in Dada has not been adequately acknowledged.” (p. 11).\n\nWhite also cites a poem by Johannes Becher which he uses as evidence that Emmy served as a muse for other artists of the time:<br>\"It was in Munich, at the Café Stefanie,<br>Where I recited for you, Emmy, poems<br>That I dared tell only you,\"\n\nThe following poem is an example of Hennings' poetry:\n\nTänzerin\n\nDir ist als ob ich schon gezeichnet wäre\n\nUnd auf der Totenliste stünde.\n\nEs hält mich ab von mancher Sünde.\n\nWie langsam ich am Leben zehre.\n\nUnd ängstlich sind oft meine Schritte,\n\nMein Herz hat einen kranken Schlag\n\nUnd schwächer wird's mit jedem Tag.\n\nEin Todesengel steht in meines Zimmers Mitte.\n\nDoch tanz ich bis zur Atemnot.\n\nBald werde ich im Grabe liegen\n\nUnd niemand wird sich an mich schmiegen.\n\nAch, küssen will ich bis zum Tod.\n\nDancer\n\nTo you it's as if I was already\n\nMarked and waiting on Death's list.\n\nIt keeps me safe from many sins.\n\nHow slowly life drains out of me.\n\nMy steps are often steeped in gloom,\n\nMy heart beats in a sickly way\n\nAnd it gets weaker every day.\n\nA death angel stands in the middle of my room.\n\nYet I dance till I'm out of breath.\n\nSoon lying in the grave I'll be\n\nAnd no one will snuggle up to me.\n\nOh, give me kisses up till death.\n\n\n"}

The Cholitas are part of a group called the Titans of the Ring, which includes both male and female wrestlers. The Titans perform each Sunday for an audience of hundreds at El Alto's Multifunctional Center. Tickets to the exhibitions cost $1.\n\nThe idea of including female wrestlers as a maneuver for publicity came from Juan Mamami, a wrestler and president of the Titans. They routinely attract over a thousand spectators to their bouts in El Alto and several hundred spectators when they travel with the Titans to smaller towns.\n\nLike the general population of El Alto, which consists almost entirely of Aymara and Quechua residents, the Cholitas are indigenous. They wear braided hair, bowler hats and multilayered skirts in the ring.\n\nAccording to a 2005 \"New York Times\" article, the Titans earn about $13 for each bout. Most of the wrestlers have other jobs besides their wrestling careers.\n\nThe Fighting Cholitas were featured in an October 2008 episode of the American reality series \"The Amazing Race\", in which a contestant from each team was tasked with learning and performing a six-step wrestling routine with a Cholita.\n\nThe Cholitas were the subject of an award-winning 2006 short-subject documentary, \"The Fighting Cholitas\".

{"id": "619315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=619315", "title": "Fringe theatre", "text": "Fringe theatre\n\nFringe theatre is theatre that is experimental in style or subject matter. The term comes from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In London, the fringe are small-scale theatres, many of them located above pubs, and the equivalent to New York's Off-Off-Broadway theatres and Europe's \"free theater\" groups.\n\nIn unjuried theatre festivals, all submissions are accepted, and sometimes the participating acts may be chosen by lottery, in contrast to juried festivals in which acts are selected based on their artistic qualities. Unjuried festivals (e.g., Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Adelaide Fringe Festival, and Fringe World) permit artists to perform a wide variety of works.\n\nIn 1947, eight theatre companies showed up at the Edinburgh International Festival, hoping to gain recognition from the mass gathering at the festival. In 1948, Robert Kemp, a Scottish journalist and playwright, described the situation, \"Round the fringe of official Festival drama, there seems to be more private enterprise than before ... I am afraid some of us are not going to be at home during the evenings!\". Edinburgh Festival Fringe was founded in 1947. The first movement in Britain started in the 1960s, and is considered similar to the United States' Off-Off-Broadway theaters and Europe's \"free theater\" groups. The term came into use in the late 1950s, and the show \"Beyond the Fringe\" premiered in Edinburgh in 1960, before transferring to Broadway and is the West End. One of the early innovators in fringe theatre was an American bookseller, James Haynes, who in 1963 created the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh. Also noted in this period is the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, Jerzy Grotowski's Theatre of 13 Rows, and Józef Szajna's Studio Theatre in Warsaw.\n\nHaynes, while at the helm of the Traverse, was receiving state support and even got a new theatre in 1969. In 1969, Haynes created the Arts Lab in London, but it only lasted for two years. Peter Brook along with another American Charles Marowitz opened the Open Space Theatre on Tottenham Court Road in London in 1968. Young British writers, after the May 1968 events in France, wrote agitprop plays, including David Hare, Howard Brenton, David Edgar.\n\nMeanwhile, in the United States, experimental theatre was growing due to the political protest of the Vietnam War. The Living Theatre, founded by Julian Beck, is considered the leader of the \"flower power\" and \"hippie\" movement.\n\nBy the early 1970s, many fringe theatres began to receive small subsidies. After the 1973–74 stock market crash, many fringe companies were forced to close. New playwrights were established at the Bush Theatre and King's Head Theatre, both of whom survived the crash. and Red Ladder Theatre Company were some of the surviving touring fringe groups.\n\nFringe theatres were attractive to people in the 1960s due to their adventurousness but became less wild in the 1970s while the standards of production rose.\n\nIn 1982, the first fringe festival in North America was started in Edmonton, Alberta. It was then a theatre component of the larger Summerfest but evolved to become a stand-alone event, the Edmonton International Fringe Festival, one of the largest annual arts events in Canada and still the largest fringe in North America by attendance. The oldest fringe festival in the United States is Orlando, FL, founded in 1992. There are more fringe festivals in North America than any other continent.\n\nOne distinction between fringe festivals and conventional arts festivals is the method used to choose participants. Typically, conventional festivals use a jury selection process, whereas many fringe festivals do not use a jury process in their selection criteria. There are exceptions to this; some fringe festivals (e.g., New York International Fringe Festival) do employ a jury-based selection process.\n\nAll performers are welcome to apply, regardless of their professional or amateur status. No restrictions are made as to the nature, style or theme of the performance, though some festivals have children's areas with appropriate content limitations. Festivals may have too many applicants for the number of available spaces; in this case, applicants are chosen based on an unrelated criterion, such as order of application or a random draw.\n\nThe number of performances varies among different fringe festivals. Larger festivals may have thousands of performances (e.g., Edinburgh's 2013 festival had 45,464 performances).\n\nFringe festivals typically have a common organising group that handles ticketing, scheduling, and some overall promotion (such as a program including all performers). Each production pays a set fee to this group, which usually includes their stage time as well as the organizational elements. The organising group and/or the venues often rely on a large pool of volunteers.\n\nTicket pricing varies between festivals. At UK fringe festivals, groups can decide their own ticket prices, and some sell tickets at fixed rates in one or two tiers, or in groups of 5 or 10.\n\nAlthough it is unusual for the organising group to choose any winners of the festival, other organisations often make their own judgements of festival entries\n. Productions can be reviewed by newspapers or publications specific to the festival, and awards may be given by certain organisations. Awards or favourable reviews can increase the tickets sales of productions or lead to extra dates being added .\n\nThe limitations and opportunities that the fringe festival format presents lead to some common features.\n\nShows are not judged or juried. Depending on the popularity, some fringe festivals may use a lottery system to determine which shows are selected.\n\nShows are typically technically sparse. They are commonly presented in shared venues, often with shared technicians and limited technical time, so sets and other technical theatre elements are kept simple. Venues may be adapted from other uses.\n\nCasts tend to be smaller than mainstream theatre; since many of the performing groups are traveling, and venues (and thus potential income) tend to be fairly small, expenses must usually be kept to a minimum. One-person shows are therefore quite common at fringe festivals. \n\nFringe festival productions often showcase new scripts, especially ones on more obscure, edgy, or unusual material. The lack of artistic vetting combined with relatively easy entry make risk-taking more feasible.\n\nWhile most mainstream theatre shows are two or three acts long, taking two to three hours with intermissions, fringe shows tend to be closer to one-hour, single-act productions. The typically lowered ticket prices of a fringe theatre show permit audiences to attend multiple shows in a single evening.\n\nPerformers sometimes billet in the homes of local residents, further reducing their costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He formerly served as vice president of strategy and communications at Trymedia, and was their first US hire. As a marketing director of CMP Media, he managed Gamasutra and \"Game Developer\" magazine. In 2008 he created now-defunct start-up RMBR to introduce game mechanics into photo sharing. He was the Chief Marketing/Strategy Officer at Boonty Inc., an online company that sells downloadable games. He has served as co-director of the New York chapter of the Founder Institute as well as a board member of StartOut.org He is the co-founder and CEO of Dopamine, Inc., a firm that specializes in helping businesses utilize gamification.\n\nIn his role as CEO of Gamification.co, Zichermann chairs the organization's annual Gamification Summit, delivering the keynote address each year. \n\nAlthough the term 'gamification' was coined by the founder of Bunchball, Rajat Paharia, Gabe Zichermann is known as one of the concept's most vocal advocates.\n\nZichermann reports that he gravitated towards using game mechanics professionally with games like \"Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?\" and \"Civilization\". In his speeches at TED he argues that not only can gamification be exploited by business but it also can be utilized in education as a serious game to teach students that are not otherwise engaged with traditional classrooms. He points to educationalist Anant Pai's work with an elementary school in White Bear Lake, Minnesota as well as University of Washington's Foldit program. He counters the argument that the immersive environment of video games don't teach the right kind of attention by pointing to the concept of fluid intelligence. Zichermann believes the intense mental engagement of video games is tied to the dopamine released in game participants as the players receive rewards in game. Zichermann also refutes the idea that gamification is necessarily pernicious or simply a fad by pointing to the positive results of gamification applied outside of the entertainment industry, although he has acknowledged that a dark side does exist to this technology. He also posits that gamification could be taken to online banking, charitable organizations, or any other industry. A system of rewards could encourage members of a gym to attend regularly.\n\nZichermann describes business software utilizing gamification as \"funware\", remarking that even websites like Facebook and LinkedIn use some element of online reward to prompt user interaction. He has explained the \"reason why Facebook is a really compelling MMO is because it's fun and you get something out of it.\" He opines that increasing the degree of game mechanics through funware in work production will become even more effective on the millennial generation raised with video games and seek to stay in a game environment at the workplace. He has criticized current location-based applications like Foursquare as lacking enough social element as well as being too complicated for users to remain engaged.\n\nIn 2010, Zichermann co-wrote \"Game-Based Marketing: Inspire Customer Loyalty Through Rewards, Challenges, and Contests\" with NPR contributor Joselin Linder, describing the game mechanics that helped make FarmVille and Foursquare so successful.\n\nIn 2011, Zichermann co-wrote \"Gamification by Design: Implementing Game Mechanics in Web and Mobile Apps\" with Christopher Cunningham. The book has been described as a quick read, introducing the concept of gamification and discussing how businesses could implement gamification to keep their customers engaged. Zichermann agrees that the book's concept of engagement may be 75% customer psychology. The book also includes a Ruby on Rails coding tutorial to implement gamification in online forum design.\n\nIn 2013, Zichermann partnered with Joselin Linder again to co-author \"The Gamification Revolution: How Leaders Leverage Game Mechanics to Crush the Competition\". The book discusses gamification as a loyalty program not unlike S&H Green Stamps or McDonald's Monopoly.\n"}

In situations where the outcome being observed is truly random and consists of independent trials of a random process, this belief is false. The fallacy can arise in many situations, but is most strongly associated with gambling, where it is common among players.\n\nThe term \"Monte Carlo fallacy\" originates from the best known example of the phenomenon, which occurred in the Monte Carlo Casino in 1913.\n\nThe gambler's fallacy can be illustrated by considering the repeated toss of a fair coin. The outcomes in different tosses are statistically independent and the probability of getting heads on a single toss is (one in two). The probability of getting two heads in two tosses is (one in four) and the probability of getting three heads in three tosses is (one in eight). In general, if \"A\" is the event where toss \"i\" of a fair coin comes up heads, then:\n\nIf after tossing four heads in a row, the next coin toss also came up heads, it would complete a run of five successive heads. Since the probability of a run of five successive heads is (one in thirty-two), a person might believe that the next flip would be more likely to come up tails rather than heads again. This is incorrect and is an example of the gambler's fallacy. The event \"5 heads in a row\" and the event \"first 4 heads, then a tails\" are equally likely, each having probability . Since the first four tosses turn up heads, the probability that the next toss is a head is:\n\nWhile a run of five heads has a probability of = 0.03125 (a little over 3%), the misunderstanding lies in not realizing that this is the case only before the first coin is tossed. After the first four tosses, the results are no longer unknown, so their probabilities are at that point equal to 1 (100%). The reasoning that it is more likely that a fifth toss is more likely to be tails because the previous four tosses were heads, with a run of luck in the past influencing the odds in the future, forms the basis of the fallacy.\n\nIf a fair coin is flipped 21 times, the probability of 21 heads is 1 in 2,097,152. The probability of flipping a head after having already flipped 20 heads in a row is . This is an application of Bayes' theorem.\n\nThis can also be shown without knowing that 20 heads have occurred, and without applying Bayes' theorem. Assuming a fair coin:\n\nThe probability of getting 20 heads then 1 tail, and the probability of getting 20 heads then another head are both 1 in 2,097,152. When flipping a fair coin 21 times, the outcome is equally likely to be 21 heads as 20 heads and then 1 tail. These two outcomes are equally as likely as any of the other combinations that can be obtained from 21 flips of a coin. All of the 21-flip combinations will have probabilities equal to 0.5, or 1 in 2,097,152. Assuming that a change in the probability will occur as a result of the outcome of prior flips is incorrect because every outcome of a 21-flip sequence is as likely as the other outcomes. In accordance with Bayes' theorem, the likely outcome of each flip is the probability of the fair coin, which is .\n\nThe fallacy leads to the incorrect notion that previous failures will create an increased probability of success on subsequent attempts. For a fair 16-sided die, the probability of each outcome occurring is (6.25%). If a win is defined as rolling a 1, the probability of a 1 occurring at least once in 16 rolls is:\n\nThe probability of a loss on the first roll is (93.75%). According to the fallacy, the player should have a higher chance of winning after one loss has occurred. The probability of at least one win is now:\n\nBy losing one toss, the player's probability of winning drops by two percentage points. With 5 losses and 11 rolls remaining, the probability of winning drops to around 50%. The probability of at least one win does not increase after a series of losses. Instead, the probability of success decreases because there are fewer trials left in which to win. The probability of winning will eventually equal the probability of winning a single toss, which is (6.25%) and occurs when only one toss is left.\n\nAfter a consistent tendency towards tails, a gambler may also decide that tails has become a more likely outcome. This is a rational and Bayesian conclusion, bearing in mind the possibility that the coin may not be fair; it is not a fallacy. Believing the odds to favor tails, the gambler sees no reason to change to heads. However it is a fallacy that a sequence of trials carries a memory of past results which tend to favor or disfavor future outcomes.\n\nThe inverse gambler's fallacy described by Ian Hacking is a situation where a gambler entering a room and seeing a person rolling a double six on a pair of dice may erroneously conclude that the person must have been rolling the dice for quite a while, as they would be unlikely to get a double six on their first attempt.\n\nResearchers have examined whether a similar bias exists for inferences about unknown past events based upon known subsequent events, calling this the \"retrospective gambler's fallacy\".\n\nAn example of a retrospective gambler's fallacy would be to observe multiple successive \"heads\" on a coin toss and conclude from this that the previously unknown flip was \"tails\". Real world examples of retrospective gambler's fallacy have been argued to exist in events such as the origin of the Universe. In his book \"Universes\", John Leslie argues that \"the presence of vastly many universes very different in their characters might be our best explanation for why at least one universe has a life-permitting character\". Daniel M. Oppenheimer and Benoît Monin argue that \"In other words, the 'best explanation' for a low-probability event is that it is only one in a multiple of trials, which is the core intuition of the reverse gambler's fallacy.\" Philosophical arguments are ongoing about whether such arguments are or are not a fallacy, arguing that the occurrence of our universe says nothing about the existence of other universes or trials of universes. Three studies involving Stanford University students tested the existence of a retrospective gamblers' fallacy. All three studies concluded that people have a gamblers' fallacy retrospectively as well as to future events. The authors of all three studies concluded their findings have significant \"methodological implications\" but may also have \"important theoretical implications\" that need investigation and research, saying \"[a] thorough understanding of such reasoning processes requires that we not only examine how they influence our predictions of the future, but also our perceptions of the past.\"\n\nIn 1796, Pierre-Simon Laplace described in \"A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities\" the ways in which men calculated their probability of having sons: \"I have seen men, ardently desirous of having a son, who could learn only with anxiety of the births of boys in the month when they expected to become fathers. Imagining that the ratio of these births to those of girls ought to be the same at the end of each month, they judged that the boys already born would render more probable the births next of girls.\" The expectant fathers feared that if more sons were born in the surrounding community, then they themselves would be more likely to have a daughter. This essay by Laplace is regarded as one of the earliest descriptions of the fallacy.\n\nAfter having multiple children of the same sex, some parents may believe that they are due to have a child of the opposite sex. While the Trivers–Willard hypothesis predicts that birth sex is dependent on living conditions, stating that more male children are born in good living conditions, while more female children are born in poorer living conditions, the probability of having a child of either sex is still regarded as near 50%.\n\nPerhaps the most famous example of the gambler's fallacy occurred in a game of roulette at the Monte Carlo Casino on August 18, 1913, when the ball fell in black 26 times in a row. This was an extremely uncommon occurrence: the probability of a sequence of red or black occurring 26 times in a row is () or around 1 in 66.6 million, assuming the mechanism is unbiased. Gamblers lost millions of francs betting against black, reasoning incorrectly that the streak was causing an imbalance in the randomness of the wheel, and that it had to be followed by a long streak of red.\n\nThe gambler's fallacy does not apply in situations where the probability of different events is not independent. In such cases, the probability of future events can change based on the outcome of past events, such as the statistical permutation of events. An example is when cards are drawn from a deck without replacement. If an ace is drawn from a deck and not reinserted, the next draw is less likely to be an ace and more likely to be of another rank. The probability of drawing another ace, assuming that it was the first card drawn and that there are no jokers, has decreased from (7.69%) to (5.88%), while the probability for each other rank has increased from (7.69%) to (7.84%). This effect allows card counting systems to work in games such as blackjack.\n\nIn most illustrations of the gambler's fallacy and the reverse gambler's fallacy, the trial (e.g. flipping a coin) is assumed to be fair. In practice, this assumption may not hold. For example, if a coin is flipped 21 times, the probability of 21 heads with a fair coin is 1 in 2,097,152. Since this probability is so small, if it happens, it may well be that the coin is somehow biased towards landing on heads, or that it is being controlled by hidden magnets, or similar. In this case, the smart bet is \"heads\" because Bayesian inference from the empirical evidence — 21 heads in a row — suggests that the coin is likely to be biased toward heads. Bayesian inference can be used to show that when the long-run proportion of different outcomes is unknown but exchangeable (meaning that the random process from which the outcomes are generated may be biased but is equally likely to be biased in any direction) and that previous observations demonstrate the likely direction of the bias, the outcome which has occurred the most in the observed data is the most likely to occur again.\n\nFor example, if the \"a priori\" probability of a biased coin is say 1%, and assuming that such a biased coin would come down heads say 60% of the time, then after 21 heads the probability of a biased coin has increased to about 32%.\n\nThe opening scene of the play \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" by Tom Stoppard discusses these issues as one man continually flips heads and the other considers various possible explanations.\n\nIf external factors are allowed to change the probability of the events, the gambler's fallacy may not hold. For example, a change in the game rules might favour one player over the other, improving his or her win percentage. Similarly, an inexperienced player's success may decrease after opposing teams learn about and play against their weaknesses. This is another example of bias.\n\nWhen statistics are quoted, they are usually made to sound as impressive as possible. If a politician says that unemployment has gone down for the past six years, it is a safe bet that seven years ago, it went up.\n\nThe gambler's fallacy arises out of a belief in a law of small numbers, leading to the erroneous belief that small samples must be representative of the larger population. According to the fallacy, streaks must eventually even out in order to be representative. Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman first proposed that the gambler's fallacy is a cognitive bias produced by a psychological heuristic called the representativeness heuristic, which states that people evaluate the probability of a certain event by assessing how similar it is to events they have experienced before, and how similar the events surrounding those two processes are. According to this view, \"after observing a long run of red on the roulette wheel, for example, most people erroneously believe that black will result in a more representative sequence than the occurrence of an additional red\", so people expect that a short run of random outcomes should share properties of a longer run, specifically in that deviations from average should balance out. When people are asked to make up a random-looking sequence of coin tosses, they tend to make sequences where the proportion of heads to tails stays closer to 0.5 in any short segment than would be predicted by chance, a phenomenon known as insensitivity to sample size. Kahneman and Tversky interpret this to mean that people believe short sequences of random events should be representative of longer ones. The representativeness heuristic is also cited behind the related phenomenon of the clustering illusion, according to which people see streaks of random events as being non-random when such streaks are actually much more likely to occur in small samples than people expect.\n\nThe gambler's fallacy can also be attributed to the mistaken belief that gambling, or even chance itself, is a fair process that can correct itself in the event of streaks, known as the just-world hypothesis. Other researchers believe that belief in the fallacy may be the result of a mistaken belief in an internal locus of control. When a person believes that gambling outcomes are the result of their own skill, they may be more susceptible to the gambler's fallacy because they reject the idea that chance could overcome skill or talent.\n\nSome researchers believe that it is possible to define two types of gambler's fallacy: type one and type two. Type one is the classic gambler's fallacy, where individuals believe that a particular outcome is due after a long streak of another outcome. Type two gambler's fallacy, as defined by Gideon Keren and Charles Lewis, occurs when a gambler underestimates how many observations are needed to detect a favorable outcome, such as watching a roulette wheel for a length of time and then betting on the numbers that appear most often. For events with a high degree of randomness, detecting a bias that will lead to a favorable outcome takes an impractically large amount of time and is very difficult, if not impossible, to do. The two types differ in that type one wrongly assumes that gambling conditions are fair and perfect, while type two assumes that the conditions are biased, and that this bias can be detected after a certain amount of time.\n\nAnother variety, known as the retrospective gambler's fallacy, occurs when individuals judge that a seemingly rare event must come from a longer sequence than a more common event does. The belief that an imaginary sequence of die rolls is more than three times as long when a set of three sixes is observed as opposed to when there are only two sixes. This effect can be observed in isolated instances, or even sequentially. Another example would involve hearing that a teenager has unprotected sex and becomes pregnant on a given night, and that she has been engaging in unprotected sex for longer than if we hear she had unprotected sex but did not become pregnant, when the probability of becoming pregnant as a result of each intercourse is independent of the amount of prior intercourse.\n\nAnother psychological perspective states that gambler's fallacy can be seen as the counterpart to basketball's hot-hand fallacy, in which people tend to predict the same outcome as the previous event - known as positive recency - resulting in a belief that a high scorer will continue to score. In the gambler's fallacy, people predict the opposite outcome of the previous event - negative recency - believing that since the roulette wheel has landed on black on the previous six occasions, it is due to land on red the next. Ayton and Fischer have theorized that people display positive recency for the hot-hand fallacy because the fallacy deals with human performance, and that people do not believe that an inanimate object can become \"hot.\" Human performance is not perceived as random, and people are more likely to continue streaks when they believe that the process generating the results is nonrandom. When a person exhibits the gambler's fallacy, they are more likely to exhibit the hot-hand fallacy as well, suggesting that one construct is responsible for the two fallacies.\n\nThe difference between the two fallacies is also found in economic decision-making. A study by Huber, Kirchler, and Stockl in 2010 examined how the hot hand and the gambler's fallacy are exhibited in the financial market. The researchers gave their participants a choice: they could either bet on the outcome of a series of coin tosses, use an expert opinion to sway their decision, or choose a risk-free alternative instead for a smaller financial reward. Participants turned to the expert opinion to make their decision 24% of the time based on their past experience of success, which exemplifies the hot-hand. If the expert was correct, 78% of the participants chose the expert's opinion again, as opposed to 57% doing so when the expert was wrong. The participants also exhibited the gambler's fallacy, with their selection of either heads or tails decreasing after noticing a streak of either outcome. This experiment helped bolster Ayton and Fischer's theory that people put more faith in human performance than they do in seemingly random processes.\n\nWhile the representativeness heuristic and other cognitive biases are the most commonly cited cause of the gambler's fallacy, research suggests that there may also be a neurological component. Functional magnetic resonance imaging has shown that after losing a bet or gamble, known as riskloss, the frontoparietal network of the brain is activated, resulting in more risk-taking behavior. In contrast, there is decreased activity in the amygdala, caudate, and ventral striatum after a riskloss. Activation in the amygdala is negatively correlated with gambler's fallacy, so that the more activity exhibited in the amygdala, the less likely an individual is to fall prey to the gambler's fallacy. These results suggest that gambler's fallacy relies more on the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive, goal-directed processes, and less on the brain areas that control affective decision-making.\n\nThe desire to continue gambling or betting is controlled by the striatum, which supports a choice-outcome contingency learning method. The striatum processes the errors in prediction and the behavior changes accordingly. After a win, the positive behavior is reinforced and after a loss, the behavior is conditioned to be avoided. In individuals exhibiting the gambler's fallacy, this choice-outcome contingency method is impaired, and they continue to make risks after a series of losses.\n\nThe gambler's fallacy is a deep-seated cognitive bias and can be very hard to overcome. Educating individuals about the nature of randomness has not always proven effective in reducing or eliminating any manifestation of the fallacy. Participants in a study by Beach and Swensson in 1967 were shown a shuffled deck of index cards with shapes on them, and were instructed to guess which shape would come next in a sequence. The experimental group of participants was informed about the nature and existence of the gambler's fallacy, and were explicitly instructed not to rely on run dependency to make their guesses. The control group was not given this information. The response styles of the two groups were similar, indicating that the experimental group still based their choices on the length of the run sequence. This led to the conclusion that instructing individuals about randomness is not sufficient in lessening the gambler's fallacy.\n\nAn individual's susceptibility to the gambler's fallacy may decrease with age. A study by Fischbein and Schnarch in 1997 administered a questionnaire to five groups: students in grades 5, 7, 9, 11, and college students specializing in teaching mathematics. None of the participants had received any prior education regarding probability. The question asked was: \"Ronni flipped a coin three times and in all cases heads came up. Ronni intends to flip the coin again. What is the chance of getting heads the fourth time?\" The results indicated that as the students got older, the less likely they were to answer with \"smaller than the chance of getting tails\", which would indicate a negative recency effect. 35% of the 5th graders, 35% of the 7th graders, and 20% of the 9th graders exhibited the negative recency effect. Only 10% of the 11th graders answered this way, and none of the college students did. Fischbein and Schnarch theorized that an individual's tendency to rely on the representativeness heuristic and other cognitive biases can be overcome with age.\n\nAnother possible solution comes from Roney and Trick, Gestalt psychologists who suggest that the fallacy may be eliminated as a result of grouping. When a future event such as a coin toss is described as part of a sequence, no matter how arbitrarily, a person will automatically consider the event as it relates to the past events, resulting in the gambler's fallacy. When a person considers every event as independent, the fallacy can be greatly reduced.\n\nRoney and Trick told participants in their experiment that they were betting on either two blocks of six coin tosses, or on two blocks of seven coin tosses. The fourth, fifth, and sixth tosses all had the same outcome, either three heads or three tails. The seventh toss was grouped with either the end of one block, or the beginning of the next block. Participants exhibited the strongest gambler's fallacy when the seventh trial was part of the first block, directly after the sequence of three heads or tails. The researchers pointed out that the participants that did not show the gambler's fallacy showed less confidence in their bets and bet fewer times than the participants who picked with the gambler's fallacy. When the seventh trial was grouped with the second block, and was perceived as not being part of a streak, the gambler's fallacy did not occur.\n\nRoney and Trick argued that instead of teaching individuals about the nature of randomness, the fallacy could be avoided by training people to treat each event as if it is a beginning and not a continuation of previous events. They suggested that this would prevent people from gambling when they are losing, in the mistaken hope that their chances of winning are due to increase based on an interaction with previous events.\n\nStudies have found that asylum judges, loan officers, baseball umpires and lotto players employ the gambler's fallacy consistently in their decision-making.\n"}

Hand models are used in advertising where advertisers want close ups of the product being handled. Most hands have blemishes such as scrapes, scars, spots, or discolorations which would stand out in a close up and distract from the product. Hand models tend to have flawless skin and hands. In female hand models agents often seek long, slender hands and fingers and long nail beds. They also value smooth, hairless, unblemished skin with minimal wrinkles and visible pores.\n\nRequirements for male hand models vary, depending on whether the job calls for a burly, construction worker type hand or a more white-collar look. For print media hand models, a necessary trait is the ability to pose in a relaxed, graceful fashion. Professional hand models avoid what photographers call \"the claw,\" the rigid grip that novices often use before the camera. Hand models are prevalent in TV commercials, although the hand may not always be visible. Many food commercials have hand models pouring gravy, dipping a French fry or cutting meat. Here perfect hands are not as important as the timing and patience required to \"hit one's mark.\" Some hand models can make upwards of $1,200 a day.\n\nHand art is the application of make-up or paint to a hand to make it appear like an animal or other object. Some hand artists, like Guido Daniele, produce images that are trompe l'oeil representations of wild animals painted on people's hands. Hand artists work closely with hand models. Models can be booked through specialist acting and modeling agencies usually advertising under \"body parts models\" or \"hands and feet models.\" Many hand models can be hired directly.\n\n"}

{"id": "38407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38407", "title": "Humour", "text": "Humour\n\nHumour (British English), also known as humor (American English; see spelling differences) is the tendency of experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement. The term derives from the humoral medicine of the ancient Greeks, which taught that the balance of fluids in the human body, known as humours (Latin: \"humor\", \"body fluid\"), controlled human health and emotion.\n\nPeople of all ages and cultures respond to humour. Most people are able to experience humour—be amused, smile or laugh at something funny—and thus are considered to have a \"sense of humour\". The hypothetical person lacking a sense of humour would likely find the behaviour inducing it to be inexplicable, strange, or even irrational. Though ultimately decided by personal taste, the extent to which a person finds something humorous depends on a host of variables, including geographical location, culture, maturity, level of education, intelligence and context. For example, young children may favour slapstick such as Punch and Judy puppet shows or the \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons, whose physical nature makes it accessible to them. By contrast, more sophisticated forms of humour such as satire require an understanding of its social meaning and context, and thus tend to appeal to a more mature audience.\n\nMany theories exist about what humour is and what social function it serves. The prevailing types of theories attempting to account for the existence of humour include psychological theories, the vast majority of which consider humour-induced behaviour to be very healthy; spiritual theories, which may, for instance, consider humour to be a \"gift from God\"; and theories which consider humour to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a mystical experience.\n\nThe benign-violation theory, endorsed by Peter McGraw, attempts to explain humour's existence. The theory says 'humour only occurs when something seems wrong, unsettling, or threatening, but simultaneously seems okay, acceptable or safe'. Humour can be used as a method to easily engage in social interaction by taking away that awkward, uncomfortable, or uneasy feeling of social interactions.\n\nOthers believe that 'the appropriate use of humour can facilitate social interactions'.\n\nSome claim that humour should not be explained. Author E.B. White once said, \"Humor can be dissected as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process and the innards are discouraging to any but the pure scientific mind.\" Counter to this argument, protests against \"offensive\" cartoons invite the dissection of humour or its lack by aggrieved individuals and communities. This process of dissecting humour does not necessarily banish a sense of humour but begs attention towards its politics and assumed universality (Khanduri 2014).\n\nArthur Schopenhauer lamented the misuse of \"humour\" (a German loanword from English) to mean any type of comedy. However, both \"humour\" and \"comic\" are often used when theorising about the subject. The connotations of \"humour\" as opposed to \"comic\" are said to be that of response versus stimulus. Additionally, \"humour\" was thought to include a combination of ridiculousness and wit in an individual; the paradigmatic case being Shakespeare's Sir John Falstaff. The French were slow to adopt the term \"humour\"; in French, \"humeur\" and \"humour\" are still two different words, the former referring to a person's mood or to the archaic concept of the four humours.\n\nNon-satirical humour can be specifically termed \"droll humour\" or \"recreational drollery\".\n\nAs with any art form, the acceptance of a particular style or incidence of humour depends on sociological factors and varies from person to person. Throughout history, comedy has been used as a form of entertainment all over the world, whether in the courts of the Western kings or the villages of the Far East. Both a social etiquette and a certain intelligence can be displayed through forms of wit and sarcasm. Eighteenth-century German author Georg Lichtenberg said that \"the more you know humour, the more you become demanding in fineness.\"\n\nWestern humour theory begins with Plato, who attributed to Socrates (as a semi-historical dialogue character) in the \"Philebus\" (p. 49b) the view that the essence of the ridiculous is an ignorance in the weak, who are thus unable to retaliate when ridiculed. Later, in Greek philosophy, Aristotle, in the \"Poetics\" (1449a, pp. 34–35), suggested that an ugliness that does not disgust is fundamental to humour.\n\nIn ancient Sanskrit drama, Bharata Muni's \"Natya Shastra\" defined humour (\"hāsyam\") as one of the nine \"nava rasas\", or principle \"rasas\" (emotional responses), which can be inspired in the audience by \"bhavas\", the imitations of emotions that the actors perform. Each \"rasa\" was associated with a specific \"bhavas\" portrayed on stage.\n\nThe terms comedy and satire became synonymous after Aristotle's \"Poetics\" was translated into Arabic in the medieval Islamic world, where it was elaborated upon by Arabic writers and Islamic philosophers such as Abu Bischr, his pupil Al-Farabi, Persian Avicenna, and Averroes. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from Greek dramatic representation, and instead identified it with Arabic poetic themes and forms, such as \"hija\" (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the \"art of reprehension\" and made no reference to light and cheerful events or troublesome beginnings and happy endings associated with classical Greek comedy. After the Latin translations of the 12th century, the term \"comedy\" thus gained a new semantic meaning in Medieval literature.\n\nMento star Lord Flea, stated in a 1957 interview that he thought that: \"West Indians have the best sense of humour in the world. Even in the most solemn song, like \"Las Kean Fine\" [\"Lost and Can Not Be Found\"], which tells of a boiler explosion on a sugar plantation that killed several of the workers, their natural wit and humour shine though.\"\n\nConfucianist Neo-Confucian orthodoxy, with its emphasis on ritual and propriety, has traditionally looked down upon humour as subversive or unseemly. Humor was perceived as irony and sarcasm.The Confucian \"Analects\" itself, however, depicts the Master as fond of humorous self-deprecation, once comparing his wanderings to the existence of a homeless dog. Early Daoist philosophical texts such as \"Zhuangzi\" pointedly make fun of Confucian seriousness and make Confucius himself a slow-witted figure of fun. Joke books containing a mix of wordplay, puns, situational humour, and play with taboo subjects like sex and scatology, remained popular over the centuries. Local performing arts, storytelling, vernacular fiction, and poetry offer a wide variety of humorous styles and sensibilities.\n\nFamous Chinese humorists include the ancient jesters Chunyu Kun and Dongfang Shuo; writers of the Ming and Qing dynasties such as Feng Menglong, Li Yu, and Wu Jingzi; and modern comic writers such as Lu Xun, Lin Yutang, Lao She, Qian Zhongshu, Wang Xiaobo, and Wang Shuo, and performers such as Ge You, Guo Degang, and Zhou Libo.\n\nModern Chinese humor has been heavily influenced not only by indigenous traditions, but also by foreign humor, circulated via print culture, cinema, television, and the internet. During the 1930s, the transliteration \"youmo\" (humour) caught on as a new term for humour, sparking a fad for humour literature, as well as impassioned debate about what type of humorous sensibility best suited China, a poor, weak country under partial foreign occupation. While some types of comedy were officially sanctioned during the rule of Mao Zedong, the Party-state's approach towards humour was generally repressive. Social liberalisation in the 1980s, commercialisation of the cultural market in the 1990s, and the advent of the internet have each—despite an invasive state-sponsored censorship apparatus—enabled new forms of humour to flourish in China in recent decades.\n\nThe social transformation model of humour predicts that specific characteristics, such as physical attractiveness, interact with humour. This model involves linkages between the humorist, an audience, and the subject matter of the humour. The two transformations associated with this particular model involves the subject matter of the humour, and the change in the audiences perception of the humorous person, therefore establishing a relationship between the humorous speaker and the audience. The social transformation model views humour as adaptive because it communicates the present desire to be humorous as well as future intentions of being humorous. This model is used with deliberate self-deprecating humour where one is communicating with desires to be accepted into someone else’s specific social group. Although self-deprecating humour communicates weakness and fallibility in the bid to gain another's affection, it can be concluded from the model that this type of humour can increase romantic attraction towards the humorist when other variables are also favourable. The social transformation model can also be followed in teaching and lecturing where humour is used to improve the cognitive capabilities of the students. Humour could create a positive and informal classroom environment that triggers students’ enthusiasm and interest.\n\n90% of men and 81% of women, all college students, report having a sense of humour is a crucial characteristic looked for in a romantic partner. Humour and honesty were ranked as the two most important attributes in a significant other. It has since been recorded that humour becomes more evident and significantly more important as the level of commitment in a romantic relationship increases. Recent research suggests expressions of humour in relation to physical attractiveness are two major factors in the desire for future interaction. Women regard physical attractiveness less highly compared to men when it came to dating, a serious relationship, and sexual intercourse. However, women rate humorous men more desirable than nonhumorous individuals for a serious relationship or marriage, but only when these men were physically attractive.\n\nFurthermore, humorous people are perceived by others to be more cheerful but less intellectual than nonhumorous people. Self-deprecating humour has been found to increase the desirability of physically attractive others for committed relationships. The results of a study conducted by McMaster University suggest humour can positively affect one’s desirability for a specific relationship partner, but this effect is only most likely to occur when men use humour and are evaluated by women. No evidence was found to suggest men prefer women with a sense of humour as partners, nor women preferring other women with a sense of humour as potential partners. When women were given the forced-choice design in the study, they chose funny men as potential relationship partners even though they rated them as being less honest and intelligent. Post-Hoc analysis showed no relationship between humour quality and favourable judgments.\n\nIt is generally known that humour contributes to higher subjective wellbeing (both physical and psychological). Previous research on humour and psychological well-being show that humour is in fact a major factor in achieving, and sustaining, higher psychological wellbeing. This hypothesis is known as general facilitative hypothesis for humour. That is, positive humour leads to positive health. Not all contemporary research, however, supports the previous assertion that humour is in fact a cause for healthier psychological wellbeing. Some of the previous researches’ limitations is that they tend to use a unidimensional approach to humour because it was always inferred that humour was deemed positive. They did not consider the types of humour, or humour styles. For example, self-defeating or aggressive humour. Research has proposed 2 types of humour that each consist of 2 styles, making 4 styles in total. The two types are adaptive versus maladaptive humour. Adaptive humour consist of facilitative and self-enhancing humour, and maladaptive is self-defeating and aggressive humour. Each of these styles can have a different impact on psychological and individuals’ overall subjective wellbeing.\n\n\nIn the study on humour and psychological well-being, research has concluded that high levels of adaptive type humour (affiliative and self-enhancing) is associated with better self-esteem, positive affect, greater self-competency, as well as anxiety control and social interactions. All of which are constituents of psychological wellbeing. Additionally, adaptive humour styles may enable people to preserve their sense of wellbeing despite psychological problems. In contrast, maladaptive humour types (aggressive and self-defeating) are associated with poorer overall psychological wellbeing, emphasis on higher levels of anxiety and depression. Therefore, humour may have detrimental effects on psychological wellbeing, only if that humour is of negative characteristics.\n\nHumour is often used to make light of difficult or stressful situations and to brighten up a social atmosphere in general. It is regarded by many as an enjoyable and positive experience, so it would be reasonable to assume that it humour might have some positive physiological effects on the body.\n\nA study designed to test the positive physiological effects of humour, the relationship between being exposed to humour and pain tolerance in particular, was conducted in 1994 by Karen Zwyer, Barbara Velker, and Willibald Ruch. To test the effects of humour on pain tolerance the test subjects were first exposed to a short humorous video clip and then exposed to the Cold Press Test. To identify the aspects of humour which might contribute to an increase in pain tolerance the study separated its fifty six female participants into three groups, cheerfulness, exhilaration and humour production. The subjects were further separated into two groups, high Trait-Cheerfulness and high Trait-Seriousness according to the State-Trait-Cheerfulness-Inventory. The instructions for the three groups were as follows: the cheerfulness group were told to get excited about the movie without laughing or smiling, the exhilaration group was told to laugh and smile excessively, exaggerating their natural reactions, the humour production group was told to make humorous comments about the video clip as they watched. To ensure that the participants actually found the movie humorous and that it produced the desired effects the participants took a survey on the topic which resulted in a mean score of 3.64 out of 5. The results of the Cold Press Test showed that the participants in all three groups experienced a higher pain threshold, a higher pain tolerance and a lower pain tolerance than previous to the film. The results did not show a significant difference between the three groups.\n\nThere are also potential relationships between humour and having a healthy immune system. SIgA is a type of antibody that protects the body from infections. In a method similar to the previous experiment, the participants were shown a short humorous video clip and then tested for the effects. The participants showed a significant increase in SIgA levels.\n\nThere have been claims that laughter can be a supplement for cardiovascular exercise and might increase muscle tone. However an early study by Paskind J. showed that laughter can lead to a decrease in skeletal muscle tone because the short intense muscle contractions caused by laughter are followed by longer periods of muscle relaxation. The cardiovascular benefits of laughter also seem to be just a figment of imagination as a study that was designed to test oxygen saturation levels produced by laughter, showed that even though laughter creates sporadic episodes of deep breathing, oxygen saturation levels are not affected.\n\nAs humour is often used to ease tension, it might make sense that the same would be true for anxiety. A study by Yovetich N, Dale A, Hudak M. was designed to test the effects humour might have on relieving anxiety. The study subject were told that they would be given to an electric shock after a certain period of time. One group was exposed to humorous content, while the other was not. The anxiety levels were measured through self-report measures as well as the heart rate. Subjects which rated high on sense of humour reported less anxiety in both groups, while subjects which rated lower on sense of humour reported less anxiety in the group which was exposed to the humorous material. However, there was not a significant difference in the heart rate between the subjects.\n\nHumour is a ubiquitous, highly ingrained, and largely meaningful aspect of human experience and is therefore decidedly relevant in organisational contexts, such as the workplace.\n\nThe significant role that laughter and fun play in organisational life has been seen as a sociological phenomenon and has increasingly been recognised as also creating a sense of involvement among workers.\nSharing humour at work not only offers a relief from boredom, but can \nalso build relationships, improve camaraderie between colleagues and \ncreate positive affect. Humour in the workplace may also relieve tension and can be used as a coping strategy.\nIn fact, one of the most agreed upon key impacts that workplace humour \nhas on people’s well being, is the use of humour as a coping strategy to\naid in dealing with daily stresses, adversity or other difficult \nsituations.\nSharing a laugh with a few colleagues may improve moods, which is \npleasurable, and people perceive this as positively affecting their \nability to cope.\nFun and enjoyment are critical in people's lives and the ability for \ncolleagues to be able to laugh during work, through banter or other, \npromotes harmony and a sense of cohesiveness.\n\nHumour may also be used to offset negative feelings about a\nworkplace task or to mitigate the use of profanity, or other coping \nstrategies, that may not be otherwise tolerated.\nNot only can humour in the workplace assist with defusing negative \nemotions, but it may also be used as an outlet to discuss personal \npainful events, in a lighter context, thus ultimately reducing anxiety and allowing more happy, positive emotions to surface.\nAdditionally, humour may be used as a tool to mitigate the \nauthoritative tone by managers when giving directives to subordinates. \nManagers may use self-deprecating humour as a way to be perceived as \nmore human and \"real\" by their employees. Furthermore, ethnography studies, carried out in a variety of workplace settings, confirmed the importance of a fun space in the workplace.\nThe attachment to the notion of fun by contemporary companies has \nresulted in workplace management coming to recognise the potentially \npositive effects of \"workplay\" and realise that it does not necessarily \nundermine workers’ performance.\n\nLaughter and play can unleash creativity, thus raising morale,\nso in the interest of encouraging employee consent to the rigours of \nthe labour process, management often ignore, tolerate and even actively \nencourage playful practices, with the purpose of furthering \norganisational goals. Essentially, fun in the workplace is no longer being seen as frivolous.\nThe most current approach of managed fun and laughter in the workplace \noriginated in North America, where it has taken off to such a degree, \nthat it has humour consultants flourishing, as some states have \nintroduced an official \"fun at work\" day. The results have carried claims of well-being benefits to workers, improved customer experiences and an increase in productivity that organisations can enjoy, as a result. Others examined results of this movement while focusing around the science of happiness – concerned with mental health, motivation,\ncommunity building and national well-being – and drew attention to the \nability to achieve \"flow\" through playfulness and stimulate \"outside the\nbox\" thinking. Parallel to this movement is the \"positive\" scholarship that has emerged in psychology which seeks to empirically theorise the optimisation of human potential.\nThis happiness movement suggests that investing in fun at the \nworkplace, by allowing for laughter and play, will not only create enjoyment and a greater sense of well-being, but it will also enhance energy, performance and commitment in workers.\n\nOne of the main focuses of modern psychological humour theory and research is to establish and clarify the correlation between humour and laughter. The major empirical findings here are that laughter and humour do not always have a one-to-one association. While most previous theories assumed the connection between the two almost to the point of them being synonymous, psychology has been able to scientifically and empirically investigate the supposed connection, its implications, and significance.\n\nIn 2009, Diana Szameitat conducted a study to examine the differentiation of emotions in laughter. They hired actors and told them to laugh with one of four different emotional associations by using auto-induction, where they would focus exclusively on the internal emotion and not on the expression of laughter itself. They found an overall recognition rate of 44%, with joy correctly classified at 44%, tickle 45%, schadenfreude 37%, and taunt 50%. Their second experiment tested the behavioural recognition of laughter during an induced emotional state and they found that different laughter types did differ with respect to emotional dimensions. In addition, the four emotional states displayed a full range of high and low sender arousal and valence. This study showed that laughter can be correlated with both positive (joy and tickle) and negative (schadenfreude and taunt) emotions with varying degrees of arousal in the subject.\n\nThis brings into question the definition of humour, then. If it is to be defined by the cognitive processes which display laughter, then humour itself can encompass a variety of negative as well as positive emotions. However, if humour is limited to positive emotions and things which cause positive affect, it must be delimited from laughter and their relationship should be further defined.\n\nHumour has shown to be effective for increasing resilience in dealing with distress and also effective in undoing negative affects.\n\nMadeljin Strick, Rob Holland, Rick van Baaren, and Ad van Knippenberg (2009) of Radboud University conducted a study that showed the distracting nature of a joke on bereaved individuals. Subjects were presented with a wide range of negative pictures and sentences. Their findings showed that humorous therapy attenuated the negative emotions elicited after negative pictures and sentences were presented. In addition, the humour therapy was more effective in reducing negative affect as the degree of affect increased in intensity. Humour was immediately effective in helping to deal with distress. The escapist nature of humour as a coping mechanism suggests that it is most useful in dealing with momentary stresses. Stronger negative stimuli requires a different therapeutic approach. \n\nHumour is an underlying character trait associated with the positive emotions used in the broaden-and-build theory of cognitive development.\n\nStudies, such as those testing the undoing hypothesis, have shown several positive outcomes of humour as an underlying positive trait in amusement and playfulness. Several studies have shown that positive emotions can restore autonomic quiescence after negative affect. For example, Frederickson and Levinson showed that individuals who expressed Duchenne smiles during the negative arousal of a sad and troubling event recovered from the negative affect approximately 20% faster than individuals who didn’t smile.\n\nUsing humour judiciously can have a positive influence on cancer treatment.\n\nHumour can serve as a strong distancing mechanism in coping with adversity. In 1997 Kelter and Bonanno found that Duchenne laughter correlated with reduced awareness of distress. Positive emotion is able to loosen the grip of negative emotions on peoples’ thinking. A distancing of thought leads to a distancing of the unilateral responses people often have to negative arousal. In parallel with the distancing role plays in coping with distress, it supports the broaden and build theory that positive emotions lead to increased multilateral cognitive pathway and social resource building.\n\nHumour has been shown to improve and help the ageing process in three areas. The areas are improving physical health, improving social communications, and helping to achieve a sense of satisfaction in life.\n\nStudies have shown that constant humour in the ageing process gives health benefits to individuals. Such benefits as higher self-esteem, lower levels of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress, and a more positive self-concept as well as other health benefits which have been recorded and acknowledged through various studies. Even patients with specific diseases have shown improvement with ageing using humour. Overall there is a strong correlation through constant humour in ageing and better health in the individuals.\n\nAnother way that research indicates that humour helps with the ageing process, is through helping the individual to create and maintain strong social relationship during transitory periods in their lives. One such example is when people are moved into nursing homes or other facilities of care. With this transition certain social interactions with friend and family may be limited forcing the individual to look else where for these social interactions. Humour has been shown to make transitions easier, as humour is shown reduce stress and facilitate socialisation and serves as a social bonding function. Humour may also help the transition in helping the individual to maintain positive feelings towards those who are enforcing the changes in their lives. These new social interactions can be critical for these transitions in their lives and humour will help these new social interactions to take place making these transitions easier.\n\nHumour can also help ageing individuals maintain a sense of satisfaction in their lives. Through the ageing process many changes will occur, such as losing the right to drive a car. This can cause a decrease in satisfaction in the lives of the individual. Humour helps to alleviate this decrease of satisfaction by allowing the humour to release stress and anxiety caused by changes in the individuals life. Laughing and humour can be a substitute for the decrease in satisfaction by allowing individuals to feel better about their situations by alleviating the stress. This, in turn, can help them to maintain a sense of satisfaction towards their new and changing life style.\n\nIn an article published in \"Nature Reviews Neuroscience\", it is reported that a study's results indicate that humour is rooted in the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex. The study states, in part:\"Humour seems to engage a core network of cortical and subcortical structures, including temporo-occipito-parietal areas involved in detecting and resolving incongruity (mismatch between expected and presented stimuli); and the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system and the amygdala, key structures for reward and salience processing.\"\n\nHumour can be verbal, visual, or physical. Non-verbal forms of communication–for example, music or visual art–can also be humorous.\n\n\n\nRowan Atkinson explains in his lecture in the documentary \"Funny Business\" that an object or a person can become funny in three ways:\n\nMost sight gags fit into one or more of these categories.\n\nSome theoreticians of the comic consider exaggeration to be a universal comic device. It may take different forms in different genres, but all rely on the fact that the easiest way to make things laughable is to exaggerate to the point of absurdity their salient traits.\n\nThere are many taxonomies of humor; the following is used to classify humorous tweets in (Rayz 2012).\n\nDifferent cultures have different typical expectations of humour so comedy shows are not always successful when transplanted into another culture. For example, a 2004 BBC News article discusses a stereotype among British comedians that Americans and Germans do not understand irony, and therefore UK sitcoms are not appreciated by them.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18666", "title": "Ludo (board game)", "text": "Ludo (board game)\n\nLudo (; ) is a strategy board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to the rolls of a single die. Like other cross and circle games, Ludo is derived from the Indian game Pachisi, but simpler. The game and its variations are popular in many countries and under various names.\n\nPachisi was rediscovered in India by the 6th century. The earliest evidence of this game evolution in India is the depiction of boards on the caves of Ellora. Even Pachisi was evolved from a very ancient game of Chausar played in the times of epic Mahabharata (Kurukshetra War time) about 10 century BCE. This game was played between the pandavas and kauravas. Latest version as we describe as Ludo, was played by the Mughal emperors of India; a notable example is Akbar.\n\nPachisi was modified to use a cubic die with dice cup and patented as \"Ludo\" in England in 1896. The Royal Navy took Ludo and converted it into the board game Uckers.\n\nLudo exists under different game names from various name derivations: \n\n\n\n\nSpecial areas of the Ludo board are typically coloured bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Each player is assigned a colour and has four tokens in their colour. The board is normally square with a cross-shaped , with each arm of the cross having three columns of squares, usually six per column. The middle columns usually have five squares coloured; these represent a player's \"home column\". A sixth coloured square not on the home column is a player's \"starting square\". At the centre of the board is a large \"finishing square\", often composed of coloured triangles atop the players' home columns (thus depicting \"arrows\" pointing to the finish).\n\nTwo, three, or four can play, without partnerships. At the beginning of the game, each player's four tokens are out of play and in the player's \"yard\" (one of the large corner areas of the board in the player's colour). When able to, the players will enter their tokens one per time on their respective starting squares, and proceed to race them clockwise around the board along the \"game track\" (the path of squares not part of any player's home column). When reaching the square below his home column, a player continues by moving tokens up the column to the finishing square. The rolls of a single die control the swiftness of the tokens, and entry to the finishing square requires a precise roll from the player. The first to bring all their tokens to the finish wins the game. The others often continue play to determine second-, third-, and fourth-place finishers.\n\nEach player rolls the die; the highest roller begins the game. Players alternate turns in a clockwise direction.\n\nTo enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a \"6\". If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a \"6\", the turn passes to the next player. Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the die. Players must always move a token according to the die value rolled. are not allowed; if no move is possible, the turn moves to the next player.\n\nWhen a \"6\" is rolled, the player may choose to advance a token already in play, or may enter another staged token to its starting square. Rolling a \"6\" earns the player an additional or \"bonus\" roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a \"6\" again, the player earns an additional bonus roll. If the third roll is also a \"6\", the player may not move and the turn immediately passes to the next player.\n\nPlayers may not end their move on a square they already occupy. If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token can be reentered into play only when the owner rolls a \"6\". Unlike Pachisi, there are no \"safe\" squares on the game track which protect a player's tokens from being returned. A player's home column squares are always safe, however, since no opponent may enter them.\n\n\nIn some parts of Africa the following rules are reportedly played:\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

Each person brandishes a pair of long sticks, traditionally made from biriba, canzi, or pitia wood from Brazil. The sticks, called grimas, traditionally measure 20 - 24 inches long by 1 and 1/8 inch thick. As the Maculelê rhythm plays on the atabaque, the people in the circle begin rhythmically striking the sticks together. The leader sings, and the people in the circle respond by singing the chorus of the songs. When the leader gives the signal to begin playing Maculelê, two people enter the circle, and to the rhythm of the atabaque, they begin striking their own and each other's sticks together. On the first three beats, they strike their own sticks together, making expressive and athletic dance movements, and on each fourth beat, they strike each other's respective right-hand stick together. This makes for a dance that looks like \"mock stick combat\". (Also, traditionally in Maculelê, the players wear dried grass skirts).\n\nMaculelê has steps similar to many other Brazilian dances such as \"frevo\" from Pernanbuco, \"Moçambique\" from São Paulo, \"Cana-verde\" from Vassouras-RJ, \"Bate-pau\" from Mato Grosso, \"Tudundun\" from Pará among others.\n\nIn some capoeira schools, students perform maculelê using a pair of machetes (\"facão\" in Portuguese; plural: \"facões\"). These large knives are associated with the tools used by slaves in plantations. The knives spark as they strike in the air, and the sparks along with the sounds of the knives striking one another make this performance particularly impressive. Because a fast moving dance with large knives is dangerous, only very experienced capoeiristas will use knives.\n\nThe origins of Maculelê are obscure, and there are many stories, theories and beliefs that claim \"this is how Maculelê came to be\". Here are three:\n\n\nMaculelê is sometimes practiced by itself, but is quite often practiced alongside capoeira, and is featured in many capoeira performances. Maculelê and Capoeira are fairly similar in style and reason.\n\nMaculelê was performed as a group dance in the Canadian version of \"So You Think You Can Dance\".\n\n\n"}

He is also known as \"Mimikry Srinivas, \" Mimicry Sreenivas,\n\"Mimicry Srinivas\" \"Mimicry Seenu\" and \"Mimicry Srinivos\". In the year 2013, the Education department of previous combined Andhra Pradesh state (India) included Srinivos' story in Class 8th Physics lesson in the chapter \"Sound\".\n\nSreenivos was born in a small village called Kesamudram in Warangal district of Telangana state in 1961. When he was a kid, got impressed by Dr Nerella Venumadhav's performance and started practising imitation of various voices. Fortunately, he got an opportunity to learn more and improve his skills when his family moved to Warangal which is the hometown of renowned artist Dr Venumadhav. Soon he became a favorite desciple of Dr Venumadhav. He started performing on stage when he was 15 years old and quickly became a popular artist with his new and bold experiments in mimicry and ventriloquism.\nHe is also a graphic artist and as a teenager, he ran his own graphic art business 'Navata Arts' in Warangal during the late 70s.\n\nHe graduated in 'Bachelor of Arts' from Arts and Science College (affiliated to Kakatiya University), Warangal, Telangana state, India in the year 1982.\n\nSrinivos is the first Indian mimic to perform ventriloquism and sound illusion.\nSrinivos has enthralled audiences all over India. He has performed and entertained worldwide, including cities like New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Chicago, Springfield (IL), Pittsburgh, Washington D.C., Atlanta, Huntsville, San Francisco, San Jose, Berkely, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, London, Stoke on trent, Dubai, Sharjah, Bahrain, Kuwait, Riyadh, Dammam, Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Colombo, Walatgama, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bagandatho, Kulim, Abudhabi, Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne to name a few.\n\nSrinivos created \"Dhwanyavadhaanam\", a unique feat in the world history of mimicry in the year 1990 and performed it first time in Tyagaraya gana Sabha auditorium in Hyderabad.

{"id": "19980386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19980386", "title": "Mozart family grand tour", "text": "Mozart family grand tour\n\nThe Mozart family grand tour was a journey through western Europe, undertaken by Leopold Mozart, his wife Anna Maria, and their musically gifted children Maria Anna (Nannerl) and Wolfgang Amadeus from 1763 to 1766. At the start of the tour the children were aged eleven and seven respectively. Their extraordinary skills had been demonstrated during a visit to Vienna in 1762, when they had played before the Empress Maria Theresa at the Imperial Court. Sensing the social and pecuniary opportunities that might accrue from a prolonged trip embracing the capitals and main cultural centres of Europe, Leopold obtained an extended leave of absence from his post as deputy Kapellmeister to the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. Throughout the subsequent tour, the children's \"Wunderkind\" status was confirmed as their precocious performances consistently amazed and gratified their audiences.\n\nThe first stage of the tour's itinerary took the family, via Munich and Frankfurt, to Brussels and then on to Paris where they stayed for five months. They then departed for London, where during a stay of more than a year Wolfgang made the acquaintance of some of the leading musicians of the day, heard much music, and composed his first symphonies. The family then moved on to the Netherlands, where the schedule of performances was interrupted by the illnesses of both children, although Wolfgang continued to compose prolifically. The homeward phase incorporated a second stop in Paris and a trip through Switzerland, before the family's return to Salzburg in November 1766.\n\nThe material rewards of the tour, though reportedly substantial, did not transform the family's lifestyle, and Leopold continued in the Prince-Archbishop's service. However, the journey enabled the children to experience to the full the cosmopolitan musical world, and gave them an outstanding education. In Wolfgang's case this would continue through further journeys in the following six years, prior to his appointment by the Prince-Archbishop as a court musician.\n\nThe Mozart children were not alone as 18th-century music prodigies. Education writer Gary Spruce refers to hundreds of similar cases, and cites that of William Crotch of Norwich who in 1778, at the age of three, was giving organ recitals. British scholar Jane O'Connor explains the 18th century fascination with prodigies as \"the realisation of the potential entertainment and fiscal value of an individual child who was in some way extraordinary\". Other childhood contemporaries of Mozart included the violinist and composer Thomas Linley, born the same year as Wolfgang, and the organist prodigy Josef Siegmund Bachmann. Mozart eventually became recognised among prodigies as the future standard for early success and promise.\n\nOf seven children born to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart, only the fourth, Maria Anna (Nannerl), born 31 July 1751, and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, survived infancy. The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography. Their musical education was aided by exposure to the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians. When Nannerl was seven her father began to teach her to play the harpsichord, with Wolfgang looking on; according to Nannerl's own account \"the boy immediately showed his extraordinary, God-given talent. He often spent long periods at the clavier, picking out thirds, and his pleasure showed that they sounded good to him... When he was five years old he was composing little pieces which he would play to his father who would write them down\". A family friend, the poet Johann Andreas Schachtner, recounted that at the age of four Wolfgang began to compose a recognisable piano concerto, and was able to demonstrate a phenomenal sense of pitch.\n\nNannerl herself was an apt pupil, no less quick to learn than her brother, and was playing the keyboard with striking virtuosity by the time she was eleven. In that year, 1762, Leopold brought the children to Munich to play before Maximilian III Joseph, the Elector of Bavaria. Leopold then took the entire family to Vienna, on a trip that lasted for three months. He had secured invitations from several noble patrons, and within three days of arriving the children were playing at the palace of Count Collalto. Among those present was the Viennese Treasury councillor and future prime minister Karl von Zinzendorf, who noted in his diary that \"a little boy, said to be only five-and-a-half years old (Wolfgang was actually nearly seven) played the harpsichord\". After an appearance before the Imperial Vice-Chancellor, the Mozarts were invited to the royal court, where the Empress Maria Theresa tested Wolfgang's abilities by requiring him to play with the keyboard covered. During this court visit Wolfgang met the Archduchess Maria Antonia, the future Queen Marie Antoinette of France, who was two months his senior. Mozart's biographer Eric Blom recounts an anecdote of how the Archduchess helped Wolfgang when he slipped on the polished floor; she is supposed to have received a proposal of marriage in return.\n\nAs the Mozarts began to be noticed by the Viennese aristocracy, they were often required to give several performances during a single day. They were well rewarded for this activity—at the end of their first hectic week in Vienna, Leopold was able to send home the equivalent of more than two years' salary. Their schedule was interrupted when Wolfgang fell ill with scarlet fever, and their former momentum was not regained. Nevertheless, the visit left Leopold eager to pursue further opportunities for social and financial success. On their return to Salzburg, Wolfgang played the harpsichord and violin at a birthday concert for the Archbishop, to the evident astonishment of those present.\n\nIn a letter to his friend and landlord Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \"the most ungrateful creature\". He was said to have describe Wolfgang as \"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg\". Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.\n\nLeopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money \"en route\", while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.\n\nWolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently without any tuition whatsoever. As for more general preparation, the children delighted in making music together, something they never lost. On tour, even during the busiest travelling days they would fit in their daily practice, appearing to thrive on the hectic schedule. Before the journey could begin, Leopold needed the consent of his employer, the prince-archbishop. Leopold had only been appointed deputy Kapellmeister in January 1763; nevertheless the archbishop's consent to an extended leave of absence was granted, on the grounds that the Mozarts' successes would bring glory to Salzburg, its ruler, and to God.\n\nThe journey's beginning, on 9 July 1763, was inauspicious; on the first day a carriage wheel broke, requiring a 24-hour pause while repairs were carried out. Leopold turned this delay to advantage by taking Wolfgang to the nearby church at Wasserburg, where according to Leopold the boy played on the organ pedalboard as if he had been studying it for months. In Munich, on successive evenings, the children played before Elector Maximilian III, earning from these engagements the equivalent of half of Leopold's annual salary of 354 gulden or florins. The next stop was Augsburg, where Leopold's estranged mother refused to attend any of the three concerts given there. The family then moved on to Schwetzingen and the Mannheim court, where the children's performance apparently amazed Elector Palatine Karl Theodor and his Electress.\n\nThe next extended stop was at Mainz. The Elector was ill, but the Mozarts gave three concerts in the town, which brought in 200 gulden. From Mainz the family took the market boat up the River Main to Frankfurt, where several public concerts were given. Among those present at the first of these was the fourteen-year-old Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who would many years later recall \"the little fellow with his wig and his sword\". An advertisement for these concerts announced that \"the girl\" would play \"the most difficult pieces by the greatest masters\", while \"the boy\" would play a concerto on the violin and also repeat his Vienna trick of playing with the keyboard completely covered by a cloth. Finally \"he will improvise out of his head, not only on the fortepiano but also on the organ...in all the keys, even the most difficult, that he may be asked\".\n\nThe family proceeded by riverboat to Koblenz, Bonn and Cologne. Turning west they reached Aachen, where a performance was given before Princess Anna Amalia of Prussia, the sister of Frederick the Great. The princess tried to persuade Leopold to abandon his itinerary and go to Berlin, but Leopold resisted. \"She has no money,\" he wrote to Hagenauer, recounting that she had repaid the performance with kisses. \"Howbeit, neither mine host nor the postmaster are to be contented with kisses.\" They proceeded into the Austrian Netherlands, an area corresponding roughly to present-day Belgium and Luxembourg, where they arrived in the regional capital, Brussels, on 5 October. After several weeks' waiting for the governor-general, Prince Charles of Lorraine, to summon them (\"His highness the prince does nothing but hunt, gobble and swill\", wrote Leopold to Hagenauer), the Mozarts gave a grand concert in the prince's presence on 7 November. On the 15th the family departed for Paris.\n\nDuring the hiatus in Brussels, Wolfgang turned his attention briefly from performing to composing. On 14 October he finished an Allegro for harpsichord, which would later be incorporated into the C major sonata, K. 6, which he completed in Paris.\n\nOn 18 November 1763 the Mozart family arrived in Paris, one of the most important musical centres of Europe, and also a city of great power, wealth, and intellectual activity. Leopold hoped to be received by the court of Louis XV at nearby Versailles. However, a recent death in the royal family prevented any immediate invitation, so Leopold arranged other engagements. One person who took particular note of the children was the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior von Grimm, whose journal records Wolfgang's feats in glowing terms: \"the most consummate Kapellmeister could not be more profound in the science of harmony and modulation\". Leopold's own assessment, written a few months later, was similarly effusive: \"My little girl, although only 12 years old, is one of the most skilful players in Europe and, in a word, my boy knows more in his eighth year than one would expect for a man of forty\".\n\nOn 24 December the family moved to Versailles for two weeks during which, through a court connection, they were able to attend a royal dinner, where Wolfgang was reportedly allowed to kiss the hand of the Queen. At Versailles they also visited the famous courtesan Madame de Pompadour, then in the last months of her life—\"an extremely haughty woman who still ruled over everything\", according to Leopold. In Nannerl's later recollections, Wolfgang was made to stand on a chair to be examined by the Madame, who would not allow him to kiss her.\n\nThere is no record of the children giving a formal concert at Versailles. In February 1764 they were given 50 louis d'or (about 550 florins) and a gold snuff-box by the royal entertainments office, presumably for entertaining the royal family privately, but no more details are available. Further concerts were given in Paris on 10 March and on 9 April, at a private theatre in the rue et Porte St Honoré. At the same time Wolfgang's first published works were printed: two pairs of sonatas for harpsichord and violin, K. 6 and 7, and K. 8 and 9. These pairs became Opus 1 and Opus 2 in Leopold's private catalogue of his son's work. The first pair was dedicated to the king's daughter, Madame Victoire de France, the second to the Countess of Tessé. Mozart biographer Stanley Sadie comments that some aspects of these pieces are rather childish and naïve, but that nevertheless their technique is \"astonishingly sure, their line of thinking is clear and smooth, and their formal balance is beyond reproach\".\n\nA decision was taken in Paris to go to London, perhaps on the advice of Leopold's musical and court acquaintances, who would probably have advised him that England was, in the words of the Mozart scholar Neal Zaslaw, \"known for the enthusiasm with which it received continental musicians and the extravagance with which it rewarded them\". On 10 April the family left for Calais and after an unpleasant crossing to Dover on a hired boat, and some delays, arrived in London on 23 April.\n\nThe Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\".\n\nMany of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\". Wolfgang was advertised as \"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\" (he was in fact eight), \"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise. He was ill for several weeks, and for the sake of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at 180 Ebury Street, then considered part of the village of Chelsea.\n\nDuring Leopold's illness performances were impossible, so Wolfgang turned to composition. According to the writer and musician Jane Glover, Wolfgang was inspired to write symphonies after meeting Johann Christian Bach. It is not clear when this meeting occurred, or when Wolfgang first heard J. C. Bach's symphonies, although he had played the older composer's harpsichord works in his May 1764 royal recital. Wolfgang soon completed his Symphony No. 1 in E flat, K. 16, and started his No. 4 in D major, K. 19 (which Zaslaw concludes was more likely composed, or at least completed, in The Hague). The D major symphony has, in Hildesheimer's words, \"an originality of melody and modulation which goes beyond the routine methods of his [grown-up] contemporaries\". These are Wolfgang's first orchestral writings, although Zaslaw hypothesises a theoretical \"Symphony No. 0\" from sketches in Wolfgang's musical notebook. Three lost symphonies, identified in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's works only by their incipits (first few bars of music), may also have originated from the London period. Other works composed by Wolfgang in London include several instrumental sonatas, the jewel of which, according to Hildesheimer, is the C major sonata for piano, four hands, K. 19d. A set of violin sonatas, with extra flute and cello parts, was dedicated to Queen Charlotte at her request, and presented to her with an appropriate inscription in January 1765. Wolfgang also wrote his first vocal works, the motet \"God is our Refuge\", K. 20, and the tenor aria \"Va, dal furor portata\", K. 21.\nAt the end of September, with Leopold's recovery, the family moved back to central London, to lodgings in Thrift Street (later 20 Frith Street), Soho. These lodgings were located conveniently close to several concert rooms, and to the residences of both J. C. Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. Bach, a son of Johann Sebastian Bach, soon became a family friend; Nannerl later recalled Bach and the eight-year-old Wolfgang playing a sonata together, taking turns to play a few bars individually, and that \"anyone not watching would have thought it was played by one person alone\". There is no record that the Mozarts met Abel, but Wolfgang knew his symphonies, perhaps through the medium of the annual Bach-Abel concert series, and was much influenced by them.\n\nOn 25 October, at King George's invitation, the children played at the celebrations marking the fourth anniversary of the king's accession. Their next public appearance was a concert on 21 February 1765, before a moderate audience—the date clashed with a Bach-Abel concert. Only one more London concert was given, on 13 May, but between April and June members of the public could go to the Mozarts' lodgings where, for a five shilling fee, Wolfgang would perform his musical party pieces. During June both the \"young Prodigies\" performed daily at the Swan and Harp Tavern in Cornhill, the charge this time being a mere two shillings and sixpence. These were, as Sadie puts it, \"Leopold's last, desperate effort to extract guineas from the English public\". Hildesheimer likens this part of the tour to a travelling circus, comparing the Mozarts to a family of acrobats.\n\nThe Mozarts left London for the continent on 24 July 1765. Before this, Leopold allowed Wolfgang to be subjected to a scientific examination, conducted by The Hon. Daines Barrington. A report, issued in \"Philosophical Transactions\" for the year 1770, confirms the truth of Wolfgang's exceptional capabilities. Practically the last act of the family in London was the gift to the British Museum of the manuscript copy of \"God is our Refuge\".\n\nLeopold had been specific in letters to Hagenauer that the family would not visit the Dutch Republic, but would go to Paris and then return home to Salzburg. However, he was persuaded by an envoy of the Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau, sister of the Prince of Orange, to go instead to The Hague and to present the children to her, as official guests of the court. After the party's landing at Calais there was a month's delay at Lille, as first Wolfgang fell sick with tonsillitis, then Leopold suffered prolonged dizziness attacks. Early in September the family moved on to Ghent, where Wolfgang played on the new organ at the Bernardines chapel; a few days later he played on the cathedral organ at Antwerp. On 11 September the family finally reached The Hague.\n\nAfter arriving in The Hague, Nannerl developed a severe cold and was unable to participate in the initial concerts before the Princess during their first week, nor in a performance before the Prince a few days later. Leopold was sufficiently confident of Nannerl's recovery to announce the appearances of both prodigies at a concert to be given at the hall of the Oude Doelen on 30 September. The notice for this concert gives Wolfgang's age as eight (he was nine), but correctly gives Nannerl's as fourteen. The advertisement concentrates on Wolfgang: \"All the overtures will be from the hands of this young composer [...] Music-lovers may confront him with any music at will, and he will play it at sight\". It is not certain whether this concert in fact took place—Sadie believes it may have been postponed. If it did happen, Wolfgang appeared alone, for by this time Nannerl's cold had turned into typhoid fever. Her condition grew steadily worse, and on 21 October she was given the last sacrament. A visit from the royal physician turned the tide; he changed the treatment, and by the end of the month she was recovering. Then Wolfgang fell ill, and it was mid-December before he was on his feet again.\n\nBoth children were able to appear at the Oude Doelen on 22 January 1766, in a concert which may have included the first public performance of one of Wolfgang's London symphonies, K. 19, and possibly of a new symphony in B flat major K. 22, composed in the Netherlands. Following this concert they spent time in Amsterdam before returning to The Hague early in March. The main reason for their return was the forthcoming public celebrations of the Prince of Orange's coming of age. Wolfgang had composed a quodlibet (song medley) for small orchestra and harpsichord, entitled \"Gallimathias musicum\", K. 32, which was played at a special concert to honour the Prince on 11 March. This was one of several pieces composed for the occasion; Wolfgang also wrote arias for the Princess using words from Metastasio's libretto \"Artaserse\" (including \"Conservati fedele\", K. 23), and keyboard variations on a Dutch song \"Laat ons juichen, Batavieren!\" K. 24. He wrote a set of keyboard and violin sonatas for the Princess, as he had earlier for the French princess and for the Queen of Great Britain. Another symphony, K. 45a, commonly known as \"Old Lambach\" and once thought to have been written several years later, was also written in The Hague, possibly for the Prince's coming-of-age concert.\n\nThe family left The Hague at the end of March, moving first to Haarlem, where the organist of St Bavo's Church invited Wolfgang to play on the church's organ, one of the largest in the country. From there they traveled east and south, giving concerts along the way at Amsterdam and Utrecht at 21 April, before leaving the Netherlands and traveling through Brussels and Valenciennes, to arrive in Paris on 10 May.\n\nThe family remained in Paris for two months. No concerts were given by them in this period although, according to Grimm, there were performances of Wolfgang's symphonies. Grimm was effusive about the development of both children; Nannerl, he wrote, \"had the finest and most brilliant execution on the harpsichord\", and: \"no-one but her brother can rob her of supremacy\". Of Wolfgang he quoted a Prince of Brunswick as saying that many Kapellmeisters at the peak of their art would die without knowing what the boy knew at the age of nine. \"If these children live,\" wrote Grimm, \"they will not remain in Salzburg. Monarchs will soon be disputing about who should have them\".\n\nThe only surviving music composed by Wolfgang during this Paris visit is his \"Kyrie\" in F major, K. 33, his first attempt to write formal church music. On 9 July, the family left Paris for Dijon, following an invitation from the Prince of Conti. The children played in a concert there on 19 July, accompanied by a local orchestra, about whose players Leopold made disparaging comments: \"Très médiocre – Un misérable italien détestable – Asini tutti – Un racleur\" (a scratcher) \"– Rotten\". They moved on to Lyon where Wolfgang \"preluded for an hour and a quarter with the most capable master here, yielding nothing to him\".\n\nA letter to Hagenauer dated 16 August indicated that Leopold wished to proceed to Turin, then across northern Italy to Venice, and home via the Tyrol. \"Our own interest and love of travel should have induced us to follow our noses\", he wrote, but added: \"...I have said I shall go [directly] home and I shall keep my word\". The family took a shorter route through Switzerland, arriving in Geneva on 20 August, where the children gave two concerts, and were received by the distinguished composer André-Ernest-Modeste Grétry. Many years later Grétry wrote of this encounter: \"I wrote for him [Wolfgang] an Allegro in E flat, difficult but without pretension; he played it, and everyone, except myself, thought it was a miracle. The child had never broken off, but following the modulations, he had substituted a number of passages for those I had written\". This claim, that Wolfgang improvised when faced with passages he could not play, appears to be the only adverse comment from all those called upon to test him.\n\nThe journey through Switzerland continued, with concerts at Lausanne and Zurich. Since leaving the Netherlands, Wolfgang had composed little; a minor harpsichord piece, K. 33B, written for the Zürich concerts, and later some cello pieces (since lost) written for the Prince of Fürstenberg. The prince received the party on 20 October, on its arrival in Donaueschingen on the German border, for a stay of some 12 days. Resuming their journey, they reached Munich on 8 November. They were delayed here for nearly two weeks after Wolfgang fell ill, but he was well enough to perform before the Elector, with Nannerl, on 22 November. A few days later they set out for Salzburg, arriving at their home on the Getreidegasse on 29 November 1766.\nThe party had survived major setbacks, including several prolonged illnesses which had curtailed their earning powers. Although Leopold did not reveal the full extent of the tour's earnings, or its expenses, the material benefits from the tour had evidently been considerable—but so had the costs. The librarian of St Peter's Abbey, Salzburg, thought that the gifts (\"gewgaws\") alone which they brought back were worth about 12,000 florins, but estimated the total costs of the enterprise at 20,000 florins. The expenses were certainly high; in a letter to Hagenauer sent in September 1763, after ten weeks on the road, Leopold reported expenses to date as 1,068 florins, an amount covered by their concert earnings without, however, any significant surplus. Leopold stated that \"there was nothing to be saved, because we have to travel in noble or courtly style for the preservation of our health and the reputation of my court\". He later recorded that on arrival in Paris in November 1763 that they had \"very little money\".\n\nAt times, the coffers were full; in April 1764, near the end of the Paris sojourn and after two successful concerts, Leopold announced he would shortly be depositing 2,200 florins with his bankers. Two months later, after the initial London successes, Leopold banked a further 1,100 florins. However, in November of that year, after his illness and with uncertain earning prospects, he was worrying about the high costs of living in London—he informed Hagenauer that he had spent 1,870 florins in the four-month period since July. The following summer, after little concert activity, Leopold resorted to increasingly desperate measures to raise funds, including the children's daily circus performances at the Swan and Harp Inn at prices described by Jane Glover as humiliating. The insecurity of travelling life led Leopold to believe, later, that Wolfgang was not worldly-wise enough to attempt such journeys alone, and needed to be anchored to an assured salary.\n\nIn terms of musical development, while both children had advanced, Wolfgang's progress had been extraordinary, beyond all expectation. The Mozarts were now known throughout the musical establishments and royal courts of Northern Europe. As well as the encounters in palaces with kings, queens and nobility, the children could converse in several languages; the tour represented, for them, an outstanding education. However, these advantages had been gained at a price; Grimm, in Paris, noting the stress and strain on Wolfgang in particular, had feared that \"so premature a fruit might fall before maturing\". However, Hildesheimer, while also expressing concerns, concludes that if Mozart's death at the age of 35 was caused by the exertions of his childhood, the intervening decades would not have been so productive, and obvious symptoms of decline would have manifested themselves.\n\nOf Wolfgang's music composed during the tour, around thirty pieces survive. A number of works are lost, including the Zürich cello pieces and several symphonies. The surviving works include the keyboard sonatas written in Paris, London and The Hague, four symphonies, various arias, the assorted music written for the Prince of Orange, a Kyrie, and other minor pieces. Mozart's career as a symphonist began in London where, in addition to the direct influences of Abel and J.C. Bach, he would have heard symphonies from leading London composers including Thomas Arne, William Boyce and Giuseppe Sammartini—\"a nearly ideal introduction to the genre\", according to Zaslaw. The earliest symphonies, Zaslaw points out, while not in the same class as the later Mozart masterpieces, are comparable in length, complexity and originality to those written at the same time by the acknowledged symphonic masters of the day. Indeed, Abel's Symphony No. 6 in E Flat was similar enough in style and technique to be mistaken as Mozart's, and is listed as such (Symphony No. 3, K. 18) in the original Köchel catalogue. Sadie observes that the K. 22 symphony composed in The Hague is a good deal more sophisticated than the earlier ones which were written in London.\n\nMozart's creative progress is likewise reflected in the sonatas composed for the Princess of Orange, which, according to Sadie, mark a considerable advance in technique and ideas over the earlier Paris and London sets. The arias composed in the Netherlands include Mozart's first attempts at \"aria d'affetto\", \"Per pièta, bell'idol mio\", K. 73b, once thought to have been composed much later, as its higher K number indicates. The tour thus saw Wolfgang's transformation from a composer of simple keyboard pieces to one with increasing mastery over a range of genres. This was evidenced in his home city, on 8 December, when one of his symphonies (it is uncertain which) was performed at High Mass at Salzburg Cathedral. Leopold's employer, the Prince-Archbishop, was frankly sceptical about Wolfgang's compositions, believing them to be Leopold's because they were \"not nearly bad enough to be the work of a child\".\n\nWhatever the true extent of their financial rewards from the tour, the Mozart family continued to live in their cramped apartment on the Getreidegasse, while Leopold resumed his duties as a court musician. However, travel and public display dominated the next six years of Wolfgang's life. In September 1767 the family was on the move again, this time to Vienna, remaining there (apart from an enforced evacuation during a smallpox epidemic) until January 1769. In December of the same year Leopold and Wolfgang left for Italy—without Nannerl who, now 18, was no longer exhibitable as a child wonder. They were away for sixteen months, and returned to Milan in August 1771 for five months, to attend rehearsals and the performance of Wolfgang's opera \"Ascanio in Alba\". A third and final visit to Italy, from October 1772 until March 1773, was the last of the extended trips; the new Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, Hieronymous Colloredo, had distinct views about the roles of his court musicians, which precluded the freedoms that Leopold—and now Wolfgang, himself employed by the court—had formerly enjoyed.\n\n\n"}

She began her professional career in television journalism before becoming an actress. In 2006, Munn starred as Mily Acuna on the series \"Beyond the Break\". She co-hosted \"Attack of the Show!\" from 2006 to 2010 and was a correspondent on \"The Daily Show\" from 2010 to 2011.\n\nMunn has also had supporting roles in various films and television series since 2004. She played the character Sloan Sabbith on the television series \"The Newsroom\" from 2012 to 2014, and has appeared in the films \"Magic Mike\" (2012), the horror film \"Deliver Us from Evil\" (2014), the comedy \"Mortdecai\" (2014), and \"\" (2016) as Psylocke. In 2017, she provided the voice of Koko in \"The Lego Ninjago Movie\", and also had a lead role on the History Channel series \"Six\" (2017).\n\nLisa Olivia Munn was born July 3, 1980 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Her father, Winston Barrett Munn, is an American of English, Irish and German descent. Her mother, Kimberly Schmid, was born and raised in Vietnam and is of Chinese descent. Her mother was a Vietnamese refugee who fled to Oklahoma in 1975 after the Vietnam War. After college, her mother married Winston.\n\nWhen Munn was two years old, her parents divorced and her mother remarried to a member of the United States Air Force. Although the family relocated many times, Munn was predominantly raised on Yokota Air Base near Tachikawa in Tokyo, Japan, where her stepfather was stationed. During this time, she appeared in a number of local theater productions and later became a model in the Japanese fashion industry. She has said that her stepfather was \"verbally abusive\" and demeaning. Munn has two brothers, John, a physicist, and James, a custom motorcycle shop owner. She also has a sister named Sara, who is a lawyer.\n\nHer mother and stepfather divorced when Munn was a teenager, and she moved back to Oklahoma with her mother, where she attended Putnam City North High School for her junior and senior years of high school. After graduating, Munn attended the University of Oklahoma, where she earned a B.A. in journalism with a minor in Japanese and dramatic arts.\n\nAfter graduating, she became an intern at the NBC affiliate in Tulsa, and later moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.\nIn 2004, Munn interned at Fox Sports Networks and worked as a sideline reporter for college football and women's basketball. She has gone on to say that she disliked the experience, explaining, \"I was trying to be something I wasn't, and that made me really uncomfortable on live TV.\"\nSoon after she moved to Los Angeles, Munn was cast in a small role in the direct-to-video horror film \"Scarecrow Gone Wild\". She appeared in rock band Zebrahead's music video for their song \"Hello Tomorrow\" as the love interest of the lead singer Justin Mauriello.\nMunn also appeared in \"National Lampoon's Strip Poker\", which was filmed at Hedonism II, a naturist resort in Negril, Jamaica, with Kato Kaelin. The films aired on DirecTV and In Demand pay-per-view.\n\nIn late 2005, Munn began her role as teen surfer Mily Acuna over two seasons of the television drama \"Beyond the Break\" on The N network. She enjoys surfing and continues to practice the sport. She originally auditioned for the role of Kai Kealoha, but the producers wanted a \"local girl\". She also appeared in the film \"The Road to Canyon Lake\".\n\nIn 2006, Munn moved on to the G4 network, where she began co-hosting \"Attack of the Show!\" with Kevin Pereira on 10 April. She replaced departing host Sarah Lane. The network, devoted to the world of video games and the video games lifestyle, was at first hesitant to hire Munn. Although she admits video games were her \"weak point\", she was confident in her technical knowledge. On the show, Munn was featured with journalist Anna David in a segment called \"In Your Pants\", which deals with sex and relationship questions from viewers. While working on \"Attack of the Show!\", Munn hosted \"Formula D\", a now defunct program about American drift racing, and an online podcast called \"Around the Net\", formerly known as \"The Daily Nut\", for G4. Munn left \"Attack of the Show!\" in December 2010 and was replaced by Candace Bailey. Munn appeared in the Rob Schneider film \"Big Stan\" (2007). She played Schneider's character's receptionist Maria. Munn had a significant role in the horror film \"Insanitarium\" in which she played a nurse at an insane asylum.\n\nShe had roles in the films \"Date Night\" (2010) and \"Iron Man 2\" (2010). Robert Downey, Jr. praised Munn for her improvisation skills and led the crew in a round of applause.\nMunn hosted Microsoft's Bing-a-thon, an advertisement on Hulu for the Microsoft search-engine Bing, on 8 June 2009, alongside Jason Sudeikis. Munn appeared in ABC Family's \"Greek\", portraying Cappie's love interest, Lana. In May 2010, NBC announced that Munn would star on the television series \"Perfect Couples\". The half-hour romantic comedy premiered on January 20, 2011. The series was cancelled before it completed its first season run.\n\nOn June 3, 2010, Munn debuted in her new role as a correspondent on Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\". Her hiring prompted criticism from Irin Carmon of \"Jezebel\", who questioned Munn's credentials and said the show's production was sexist for hiring Munn, whom Carmon said was a sex symbol. Carmon said Munn's hiring was a perpetuation of the show production office's history as a male-dominated atmosphere marginalizing and alienating to women. A group of thirty-two female \"Daily Show\" production staff members said Carmon's piece was inaccurate and misinformed. Munn said that Carmon's assertion was an insult both to her and to the rest of the \"Daily Show\" staff. She went on to appear in 16 more episodes as a correspondent, with \"TV Guide\" naming her signature segment \"Tiger Mothering,\" in which she mocked the high expectations of Chinese mothers, in part by interviewing her own mother. Her last episode as a correspondent aired September 2, 2011. She returned for a brief segment in host Jon Stewart's final show on August 6, 2015.\n\nIn 2010, Munn guest-starred on NBC's comedy-drama \"Chuck\" as a CIA agent.

As of June 2014, Munn has been hired as the main promoter of Proactiv acne cleanser products starring in several commercials and one infomercial for the product. The commercials show Munn experiencing acne herself. Since January 2015, she has been the voice of the character Phoebe Callisto on the Disney Junior animated series \"Miles from Tomorrowland\". In 2016, Munn was cast as Elizabeth Braddock / Psylocke (one of Apocalypse's Four Horsemen) in \"\" and will reprise the role in 2019's \"X-Men: Dark Phoenix\".\n\nBeginning in 2017, she has a starring role in the television series \"Six\" as a CIA operative.\n\nIn 2018, Munn appeared on Season 13 of America's Got Talent as a guest judge in the Judge Cuts 2 episode.\n\nMunn has appeared in advertising campaigns for Nike, Pepsi and Neutrogena. She appeared on the Fall 2006 cover of \"Foam\" magazine in September, in \"Men's Edge\" magazine in August, and was featured in a pictorial in \"Complex\" in November 2006, where she later became a columnist. In February 2007, she appeared as \"Babe of the Month\" in a non-nude pictorial in \"Playboy\" magazine. She discusses this shoot in her book \"Suck it, Wonder Woman\".\n\nMunn also appeared in the July/August 2007 issue of \"Men's Health\". In September 2007, she was featured in the Italian \"Vanity Fair\" for their \"Hot Young Hollywood\" Issue. Munn appeared in the Winter/Spring 2009 issue of \"Men's Health Living\". She was featured as the cover girl for the July/August 2009 issue of \"Playboy\", and later on the cover of the January 2010 and February 2011 issues of \"Maxim\". Munn appears on the cover of the January 2012 issue of \"FHM\" magazine. She was voted #2 by readers on \"Maxim\"s list of their Hot 100 Women of 2012.\n\nMunn's book \"Suck It, Wonder Woman: The Misadventures of a Hollywood Geek\" () was released on July 6, 2010. In a review for \"Time Out New York\", Olivia Giovetti said that the book offers glimpses into Munn's life, but does not go into depth.\n\nIn 2011, Munn teamed up with Dosomething.org's Green Your School Challenge. She was a spokesperson for the campaign by filming a PSA regarding the challenge, and sat on the panel of judges that evaluated the entries.\n\nMunn helped PETA with a campaign that ultimately freed a sick elephant from a touring circus. Her blog for \"The Huffington Post\" was credited with encouraging fans to contact the USDA on the elephant's behalf. Munn posed for PETA's \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\" campaign in April 2010, and again in January 2012. In February 2013, Munn fronted a PETA release of new footage showing cruelty to animals in Chinese fur farms.\n\nMunn was in a relationship with Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers from 2014 to 2017.\n\nIn regard to her faith and work in \"Deliver Us from Evil\", Munn has said that \"I didn't believe in the supernatural before this movie.\" However, the viewing of footage from the New York City Police Department of real-life exorcisms changed her mind, and she has stated that \"I'm a full believer [now].\"\n\nMunn is a black belt in taekwondo.\n\nIn November 2017, Munn accused film director Brett Ratner of repeatedly sexually harassing her over a period of several years.\n\n"}
{"id": "9267369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9267369", "title": "Origami (magic trick)", "text": "Origami (magic trick)\n\nOrigami is a magic stage illusion with a Japanese paperfolding theme, designed by Jim Steinmeyer. It was originally performed in 1986 by Canadian illusionist Doug Henning, using a working prop constructed by illusion builder John Gaughan. Illusionist David Copperfield later introduced presentational changes that would be widely copied by other performers.\n\n\"Origami\" was first performed by Canadian magician Doug Henning in 1986. At that time, designer Jim Steinmeyer was employed as a magic consultant by Henning.\n\nIn the original presentation, Henning displays a small box, 12 inches square and decorated with Japanese-style prints, on top of a thin table. He explains that the box is held together by two ivory skewers and a wooden pole.\n\nAt this point, a male assistant appears on stage carrying a large mirror, which is mounted at the rear of the table and reflects the back of the box. Henning explains that the purpose of the mirror is to allow the audience to see the routine from the back. The ivory skewers and wooden pole are now removed from the box and placed against the mirror.\n\nHenning tells the audience that the \"Origami Box\" is so named because it \"unfolds, like an Origami work of art.\" He proceeds to unfold the box into a larger orange and black box. He further explains that the box holds just as much when it is folded down small as when it is opened up large. To demonstrate, a female assistant wearing a turquoise costume appears on stage and climbs into the box. Henning points out that she barely fits inside the larger box; and then proceeds to fold the box down into its original smaller size. As he does so, he recites a short poem:\n\nThe female assistant has disappeared from the table and it seems impossible that she can be inside the 12 inch box. Henning now takes the ivory skewers and wooden pole and inserts them back into the box, cross ways, length ways, and vertically. He now rotates the table, showing the back for the first time. There is no sign of the assistant.\n\nHenning jokes that, the next time they travel, he will take his assistant as carry-on luggage. He now tells the audience that the Japanese believe that whatever can be folded can also be unfolded. As he does so, he begins to unfold the box, and recites the rest of the poem:\n\nThe assistant emerges from the box, now dressed in a different outfit and wearing a mask.\n\nDavid Copperfield introduced a number of presentational changes to \"Origami\" in 1989, devised by his choreographer, co-director and on-stage assistant Joanie Spina. The choreography, background music and presentational patter used in this version have all since been widely copied by other performers.\n\nCopperfield displays a red box, around 12 inches square, on a thin table. It is penetrated by three Samurai swords - \"side to side, front to back, and even from top to bottom.\" A male assistant mounts a mirror at the back of the table, and Copperfield explains that this enables the audience to \"see the box from around the sides and from the back at all times.\"\n\nCopperfield asks the audience to watch very carefully \"because we're going to do this very slowly.\"\n\nThe lights are extinguished, leaving the stage in darkness. A musical soundtrack of Peter Gabriel's Mercy Street plays. The lighting is slowly restored to reveal Copperfield, in silhouette, holding one of the Samurai swords. Behind him, a female assistant clothed in red is seen, sitting on the stage floor. Copperfield removes each of the swords from the box with a flourish and mounts them on a nearby rack, before unfolding the box to its expanded state. The larger box is white.\n\nCopperfield moves across to the female assistant, takes her hand and lifts her to her feet. The two embrace briefly, to the tempo of the music, and she then steps up onto the table. The two embrace again. The assistant then steps into the box, which Copperfield then folds back into a 12-inch cube. He takes each sword in turn, with a flourish, and stabs them through slits in the center of each face of the box; the first from front to back, the second from side to side, and then stands on the table to insert the third sword from top to bottom. He now rotates the table full circle to show all sides.\n\nThen he removes the swords, unfolds the box once again to its full size, and the assistant steps out onto the table unharmed. She is now wearing a white costume, matching the expanded box. Copperfield lifts her from the table and they embrace one last time as the lights are dimmed.\n\nIllusionist Greg Frewin developed a version of \"Origami\" in which a black cloth is placed over the mirror; the mirror is then broken and three of the broken shards are used to penetrate the box. Finally, the mirror is restored.\n\nThe original \"Origami\" prop was constructed by illusion builder John Gaughan. Current authorized versions are licensed to Gaughan and to Wellington Enterprises of New Jersey, United States.\n\nThe design of the prop is protected by US Patent #593178, issued in 2009 and expiring in 2023.\n\n"}

{"id": "40744781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40744781", "title": "Revenge porn", "text": "Revenge porn\n\nRevenge porn or revenge pornography is the distribution of sexually explicit images or video of individuals without their permission. The sexually explicit images or video may be made by a partner of an intimate relationship with the knowledge and consent of the subject, or it may be made without his or her knowledge. The possession of the material may be used by the perpetrators to blackmail the subjects into performing other sex acts, to coerce them into continuing the relationship, or to punish them for ending the relationship.\n\nIn the wake of civil lawsuits and the increasing numbers of reported incidents, legislation has been passed in a number of countries and jurisdictions to outlaw the practice, though approaches have varied. The practice has also been described as a form of psychological abuse and domestic violence, as well as a form of sexual abuse.\n\nThe term \"revenge porn\" generally refers to the uploading of this sexually explicit material to humiliate and intimidate the subject, who has broken off the relationship. The term is also often misused to describe non 'revenge' scenarios, including nonconsensual pornography distributed by hackers or by individuals seeking profit or notoriety. The images are usually accompanied by sufficient information to identify the pictured individual, typically names and locations, and can include links to social media profiles, home addresses and workplaces. Victims, whose images expose them to workplace discrimination, cyber-stalking or physical attack, can have their lives ruined as a result. Given the practice by some companies of searching for potential sources of bad publicity, many victims of revenge porn have lost their jobs and found themselves effectively unhirable. Some academics argue that the term \"revenge porn\" should not be used, and instead that it should be referred to as image based sexual abuse.\n\nJurisdictions which have passed laws against revenge porn include Israel, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, forty states of the United States, and the Australian states of Victoria, New South Wales, the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory, Western Australia and South Australia.\n\nIn the 1980s, \"Hustler\" magazine began a monthly feature of reader-submitted images of naked women called \"Beaver Hunt\". Beaver Hunt photographs were often accompanied by details about the woman, like her hobbies, her sexual fantasies, and sometimes her name. Not all of the women featured in Beaver Hunt submitted their own images and several women sued the magazine for publishing their photographs without their permission, or without verifying information on forged consent forms.\n\nTwo decades later, Italian researcher Sergio Messina identified \"realcore pornography\", a new genre consisting of images and videos of ex-girlfriends distributed through Usenet groups. In 2008, amateur porn aggregator XTube began receiving complaints that pornographic content had been posted without subjects' consent. Several sites began staging consensual pornography to resemble revenge porn, as well as hosting \"authentic\" user-submitted content.\n\nRevenge porn began garnering international media attention when Hunter Moore launched the website \"IsAnyoneUp\" in 2010. The site featured user-submitted pornography, and was one of the first sites to adopt the model initiated by Beaver Hunt: \"IsAnyoneUp\" often included identifying information, such as the subjects' names, employers, addresses and links to social networking profiles. Activist Charlotte Laws was the first person to speak out against Moore and one of the first people to publicly support revenge porn victims. This prompted backlash from some of Moore's devotees, who stalked Laws and sent her death threats.\n\nIn February 2015, the social media site and online bulletin board Reddit announced a change to its privacy policy to ban the posting of sexually explicit content without the consent of those depicted. The announcement was made after a company meeting at which the issue of \"illicit pornography—pictures and video—was a burning one\". In March 2015, Twitter followed suit with new rules to address the posting of unauthorized content and specifically revenge porn. Starting March 11, Twitter stated it would immediately remove \"any 'link to a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct' that has been posted without consent.\" According to a \"Washington Post\" article, the changes were in response to growing concerns \"that [Twitter] has not done enough to prevent bad behavior on its site.\"\n\nIn June 2015, Google announced it would remove links to revenge porn on request. Microsoft followed suit in July. Both have placed forms on-line for victims to complete. Together the two organizations account for nearly 90% of the internet search market in the US.\n\nThe website \"endrevengeporn.org\", founded by Holly Jacobs, a revenge porn victim, campaigns for the criminalization of revenge porn and considers it to be a form of sexual abuse. Jacobs is also the founder of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), a nonprofit organization that seeks to challenge cyber harassment. Danielle Citron, known for her discourse on cyber harassment as a civil rights issue, is an advisor for the CCRI. Mary Anne Franks, CCRI's Vice-President and Legislative & Tech Policy Director, has been heavily involved with legislative and policy efforts to combat revenge porn. Dr. Laura Hilly and Kira Allmann of the Oxford Human Rights Hub have characterized revenge porn as a kind of gendered hate speech designed to silence women. An article of theirs argues that this stifling of free expression is often ignored in debates over revenge porn.\n\nWhile not solely focused on revenge porn, the older non-profit organization \"Without My Consent\" provides legal resources related to it and lobbies to protect the privacy and free speech rights of online harassment victims. Since 2012, there has also been a website \"Women Against Revenge Porn\", calling itself \"not an organization or a business\", which has been cited as an advocacy group for people exposed in revenge porn. In late 2014, Elisa D'Amico and David Bateman, partners at the law firm K&L Gates, launched the Cyber Civil Rights Legal Project (CCRLP), a project offering free legal help to victims of revenge porn.\n\nTo better facilitate the introduction of relevant legislation, some anti-revenge porn activists have called upon others in their community to use gender-neutral language more often when discussing the issue. The term \"revenge porn\" itself has also come under fire. The CCRI for instance prefers the term \"nonconsensual pornography\". In analogy with \"child sexual abuse images\" being the preferred term for child pornography, McGlynn and Rackley proposed \"image-based sexual abuse\". Along with journalist Sarah Jeong, they have argued that it is harmful to associate revenge porn with pornography which revolves around consent. Jeong also considers it a mistake for activists to focus on revenge porn itself as the main problem, rather than the underlying culture which leads to its subjects being socially ostracized.\n\nIn the Australian Capital Territory, an electronic petition was started in March 2017 that called upon the A.C.T. Legislative Assembly to consider criminalizing the non-consensual disclosure of sexual images and videos. The A.C.T Legislative Assembly consequently passed a Bill that criminalised the distribution, or threatened distribution, of intimate photos and videos on 16 August 2017.\n\nLaws banning revenge pornography have been slow to emerge. Contributing factors include a lack of understanding about the gravity of the problem, free speech concerns, belief that existing law provides adequate protection, a lack of care, historically, for women's issues, and \"misunderstandings of First Amendment doctrine\" (Citron & Franks). The American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have drawn attention to the implications for free speech if legislation is too broad.\n\nSince 2009, the Philippines has criminalized copying, reproducing, sharing or exhibiting sexually explicit images or videos over the Internet without written consent of the individual depicted.\n\nIsrael responded quickly to public pressure in January 2014 and passed a law making sharing sexually explicit videos without the consent of the pictured individual punishable by up to five years in prison. After Israel's bill was passed, it was widely predicted that nearby countries such as Egypt, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia would not introduce similar bills as they have been slow to adopt legislation against sexual harassment in general. However, some commentators have suggested that victims could find recourse in existing laws against pornography, indecency, defamation and invasion of privacy.\n\nJapan passed a bill in November 2014 which made it a crime to communicate \"a private sexual image of another person\" without consent.\n\nIn November 2014, the Australian state of Victoria modified its existing sexting laws. In addition to prohibiting the sending of nude pictures without consent, the amendment also added safeguards to prevent minors from receiving child pornography charges for self-made content. The legislation followed an upsurge in the practice and the case \"Giller v Procopets\", which had to be argued on the equity of breach of confidence and tort grounds. South Australia followed in 2016, with a bill making it illegal to distribute or threaten to distribute invasive nude photographs. New South Wales passed a Bill that criminalised the distribution, or threatened distribution, of intimate photos or videos, which commenced on 25 August 2017. On 16 August 2017 the Australian Capital Territory passed a Bill that criminalised the distribution, or threatened distribution, of intimate photos and videos. On 31 October 2018 Western Australia passed a Bill that criminalised the distribution, or threatened distribution, of intimate photos and videos. Since July 1, 2018 within the Northern Territory revenge porn was made illegal.\n\nFrom 2015 onward, there have been increasing calls across Australia to pass laws designed to combat revenge porn. Queensland has introduced a bill in August 2018 to make revenge porn illegal. Tasmania is yet to introduce a bill to make revenge porn illegal.\n\nIn 2014, with the passage of the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act, Canada criminalized the \"non-consensual distribution of intimate images\" that were made under a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\".\n\nTort, privacy, copyright, and criminal laws offer remedies against people who submit revenge porn. Forty states have laws against revenge porn as of August 2018.\nFor example, New Jersey law prohibits both the capture and the distribution of sexually explicit photographs and films by any person, \"knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do so\" and without the subjects' consent. The law was used to prosecute Dharun Ravi, the Rutgers student who distributed webcam footage of his roommate Tyler Clementi engaging in sexual activity, after which Clementi killed himself. The law has also been used to prosecute several men who allegedly distributed revenge porn of their ex-girlfriends.\n\nMary Anne Franks, a law professor and constitutional scholar who drafted the model legislation and advised legislators in the majority of the above states, emphasizes that many of these laws are still deeply flawed.\n\nRepresentatives from the Department of Justice, California's Office of the Attorney General, 50 major technology companies, victim advocates, and legislative and law enforcement leaders joined together in 2015 to form a Cyber Exploitation Working Group, and have announced the creation of a working hub \"to combat so-called cyber exploitation – the practice of anonymously posting explicit photographs of others online, often to extort money from the victims.\"\n\nSeveral well-known revenge porn websites, including \"IsAnyoneUp\" and the \"Texxxan\", have been taken down in response to actual or threatened legal action. The former was investigated by the FBI after anti-revenge porn activist Charlotte Laws uncovered a hacking scheme associated with the website. Indictments for fifteen felonies were handed down under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in January 2014 for the site owner and his accomplices, and the trial was initially set to begin in November 2014 in Los Angeles. Hunter Moore, the owner of \"IsAnyoneUp\" pleaded guilty to hacking and identity theft in early 2015. Moore was sentenced to two and a half years in prison on December 2, 2015.\n\nIn December 2013, California Attorney General Kamala Harris charged Kevin Bollaert, who ran the revenge porn website \"UGotPosted\", with 31 felony counts, including extortion and identity theft. In March 2014, because the victim was under eighteen years old in the photos, a court in Ohio awarded damages of $385,000 against Bollaert. In April 2015 Bollaert was sentenced to 18 years in prison. \"Sitting behind a computer, committing what is essentially a cowardly and criminal act, will not shield predators from the law or jail\", said Attorney General Harris following the verdict. Also in California, a man named Noe Iniguez was given jail time for posting a naked photo of his ex-girlfriend on her employer's Facebook page.\n\nCasey Meyering, the operator of revenge porn website \"WinByState\", was arrested in Oklahoma in 2014 and extradited to Napa County. Meyering's website invited users to submit nude photos of ex-girlfriends and other women, with the photos categorized by state. He would then make the women featured on his website pay $250 to have their photos taken down. There were about 400 images of California women on the website, including at least one in Napa Valley, where California Attorney General Kamala Harris had filed the case. After originally pleading not guilty, on May 8, 2015, the 28-year-old man pleaded no contest to one count of extortion, three counts of attempted extortion, and one count of conspiracy. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment as of early June 2015.\n\nStates without specific laws about revenge porn have seen lawsuits alleging invasion of privacy, public disclosure of private fact and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the individuals who uploaded the images. Forty states, including California and New York, have anti-cyberharassment laws that may be applicable to cases of revenge porn.\n\nIn February 2014, a US$500,000 settlement was awarded to a Texas woman who brought suit against her ex-boyfriend for posting video and photos of her on the Internet. The state did not have a specific \"revenge porn\" law at the time of the lawsuit. California has a private right of action in tort for acts of revenge pornography within the civil code, as well as a specific criminal statute punishing revenge pornography as an invasion of privacy.\n\nSome revenge porn lawsuits have named service providers and websites as defendants alongside individuals who uploaded the images. The Communications Decency Act, also known as §230, shields websites and service providers from liability for content posted by users providing they are not themselves co-creators of the content. If user-generated content posted to a website does not violate copyright or federal criminal laws, sites have no obligation to remove the content under §230.\n\nAn estimated 80% of revenge porn pictures and videos are taken by the subjects themselves. Those individuals can bring actions for copyright infringement against the person who uploaded their nude or semi-nude \"selfies\". American victims may file Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notices with service providers. Revenge porn site MyEx.com has been a defendant in a copyright infringement case.\n\nSome free speech advocates object to revenge porn laws on First Amendment grounds, citing the fact that US laws restricting expression have a history of being overturned. Journalist Sarah Jeong argues that new criminal laws meant to combat revenge porn are likely to be overbroad, resulting in unintended consequences.\n\nRevenge porn uploaders and websites may also challenge lawsuits using state protections against strategic lawsuit against public participations (anti-SLAPP laws), which allow defendants to counter lawsuits aimed at stifling free speech.\n\nMany European countries have broad privacy statutes that may be applicable to revenge porn. France also criminalizes the willful violation of the intimate private life of another by \"transmitting the picture of a person who is within a private place, without the consent of the person concerned\". A German High Court made a May 2014 ruling that intimate photographs of partners should be deleted if the partner so requests.\n\nA law criminalising revenge porn in Malta entered into force in November 2016. Article 208E of the Maltese Criminal Code punishes whoever, with an intent to cause distress, emotional harm or harm of any nature, discloses a private sexual photograph or film without the consent of the person or persons displayed or depicted in such photograph or film. Such person would, on conviction be liable to imprisonment for a term of up to two years or to a fine of not less than €,3000 and not more than €5,000, or to both such imprisonment and fine.\n\nIn 2012, the English singer-songwriter Tulisa Contostavlos obtained an injunction preventing the distribution of a sex-tape of her and a former lover that had been published on the internet. The case was set to include considerable damages, but was settled out of court before it could be considered.\n\nIn April 2014, UK charities including The National Stalking Helpline, Women's Aid, and the UK Safer Internet Centre reported increased use of revenge porn websites. Women's Aid Charity Chief Executive Polly Neate stated, \"To be meaningful, any attempt to tackle revenge porn must also take account of all other kinds of psychological abuse and controlling behaviour, and revenge porn is just another form of coercive control. That control is central to domestic violence, which is why we're campaigning for all psychological abuse and coercive control to be criminalised\". In July Chris Grayling, the Secretary of State for Justice, announced plans to \"take appropriate action\" to address revenge porn in Britain. A House of Lords Committee, in a report on social media and the law, subsequently called for clarification from the DPP as to when revenge porn becomes a crime.\n\nIn February 2015 the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015, which has a specific amendment dealing with such actions, received Royal Assent. Section 33 of the Act makes it an offence in England and Wales to disclose private sexual photographs and films without the consent of the individual depicted and with the intent to cause distress. There is a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment.\n\nOn April 23, 2015, a seminar was held in Westminster on the new legislation. The seminar was organised by the Oxford Human Rights Hub and co-hosted with the law firm McAllister Olivarius, the End Violence Against Women Coalition, The University of Durham, and The University of Birmingham. The seminar called for the law to be extended to cover activities such as upskirting.\n\nIn June 2015 it was reported that Chrissy Chambers, a YouTube star from the United States, was pursuing a civil suit against her British ex-boyfriend who posted sexually-explicit videos taken without her knowledge or consent to Facebook where they were repeatedly shared. Chambers chose to pursue a civil case as the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 does not apply retroactively to content posted prior to its passage.\n\nBetween April 2015 (the date that section 33 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 came into force) and December 2015 the number of reported incidents of revenge pornography in England and Wales was 1,160. However, 61% of them resulted in no action being taken and the number of people prosecuted for disclosing private sexual images during the legislation's first year was 206.\n\nIn Scotland, revenge porn became a specific offence in April 2016 when the Abusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm Act came into effect.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, revenge porn was made a crime in February 2016 through the amendment of an existing law.\n\nIf the video or images in question are of individuals who are minors, this can lead to legal action for child pornography as has happened in non-revenge porn related cases involving sexting.\n\nSome couples are drafting \"social media\" prenuptial agreements, which may include provisions relating to revenge porn. Clauses may state that couples agree not to share photos or posts that are likely to harm a spouse's professional reputation.\n\nThe 2017 independent film \"#FromJennifer\" tackles the subject of revenge porn. In the film, the main character's acting career is derailed by an ex-boyfriend who posts a video of them online without her consent. When the video goes viral, her manager drops her as a client, and the ensuing humiliation she suffers leads her toward a path of destruction and counter-revenge.\n\n\n"}

Written when he was 26 it is arguably his most acclaimed, winning the Rooney Prize and the Hughes Prize in 1989, and a Betty Trask Award and the Irish Book Awards the following year. Many elements of the novel are autobiographical; the author himself was born in Belfast, attended Cambridge University, dropped out and became homeless. It is regarded as a significant novel, producing \"both a re-evaluation of Northern Irish literary identity, and an alternative perspective on the Troubles.\"\n\nThe novel is set over four days in London, where homeless 22-year-old Ripley Bogle aimlessly wanders the streets and, with angry satire, reflects on his life, directly addressing the reader. There are frequent flashbacks to growing up on the Turf Lodge estate in West Belfast during The Troubles, his move to Cambridge University and his subsequent decline into homelessness.\n\n\nIt was adapted for the stage in 1997 at Theatre503 when it was directed by Richard Hurst and again in 2005 when adapted by actor Sean O Tarpaigh (at Camden People's Theatre).\n\n"}

The venue is known for its live music, and sponsorship of cycling and other sporting events. It is located two doors down from the world-famous Cain’s Ballroom, 3 blocks from the Brady Theater, and 0.5 mi from the BOk center arena.\n\nOwned by Mike Wozniak and Josh Gifford, the bar was one of the first businesses, along with Caz’s and McNellie’s, to initiate the revitalization of Tulsa’s downtown nightlife in the mid-2000s. It was selected best venue for original live music from Urban Tulsa’s “Best of Tulsa” in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011, and the club has been featured in issues of \"Southern Living\", \"Spin\", \"Reuters\", and the China Shop blog.\n\nLocated at 409 N. Main St. in Tulsa, The SOUNDPONY is open, as its door says, at “3-ish” until close around 2am. It sports a shot-gun style layout of 1500 sq feet, not including a back outdoor patio with a view of the Tulsa skyline. Featuring a full bar, the bar also carries Marshall (Tulsa), Coop (OKC), and Boulevard (KC) beers on tap, a large bottled beer selection, darts, retro video games, and a turntable and mic behind the bar, which is used for Tuesday’s trivia night. Sometimes the bar facilitates consignment bike sales.\n\nMike Wozniak and Josh Gifford met in Norman where they worked at Chili’s circa 1994. After both moving to Tulsa, they bartendered together at Empire Bar and the Brook, where they aspired to have their own establishment so that they could have a venue for their own creative endeavors in music and video. Eventually, they started a company called Creative Juices that made wedding videos and art.\n\nTo finance the bar, they took out personal lines of credit that were secured by Josh’s life insurance policy and Mike’s house. Doug Dijarne at Bank of Oklahoma handled the financing. Contractor Mickey Payne found the space near Cain’s, noting it would be a good spot because the ticket line from Cain’s often stretches past the space that was to become the bar.\n\nOnce money and name were in place, Mike and Josh enlisted the help of Duvall Architects (the firm that also designed Vintage 1740 and the Dust Bowl in Tulsa) and contractor Mickey Payne of Happy Hammer, along with Roger Condray welder who did much of the bar’s fixtures and signs. Artist Anne-Marie Foy did the iconic SOUNDPONY moss sign inside the bar.\n\nIn addition to the short-lived band, the SOUNDPONY race team existed before the bar, though they were incorporated in July, 2005.\n\nThe Bar opened May 2006 and tends to attract a diverse and varied crowd. As Mike states, “The bar has changed and evolved over time in a very organic way. Just like we envisioned.”\n\nPeople often wonder how the bar got its name. One year when Mike was in Vail, he called Josh who was at the moment playing music with a band back in Tulsa. Someone yelled out, “We are the fabulous SOUNDPONY.” Eventually, drawing on the myth, the word got tied to the idea of a good horse, riding, racing, and then bikes, any form of alternate transportation. As Josh put it, “Legend has it that Johnny Rotten, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, James Earl Jones, Conan, Bob Newhart, and a horse had an orgy and out blasted the SOUNDPONY.”\n\nThe SOUNDPONY is known for sponsoring cycling, art, music. Bands that have performed at the Pony include Marbin, Pontiak, Klondike 5, Sweet Baby Jaysus, The Eastern Sea and Oilhouse. The bar's music consists of everything from Soul and Punk to DJs, Jazz, and Hip-Hop. but it is best known for its indie music scene.\n\nAthletes like Floyd Landis, Brad Huff, and Ivan Stevic, along with musicians like Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney of the Black Keys and Georgia Hubley, Ira Kaplan, James McNew of Yo La Tengo, can regularly be seen at the Pony after events and shows.\n\n"}
{"id": "1064537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1064537", "title": "Santa Sangre", "text": "Santa Sangre\n\nSanta Sangre (Holy Blood) is a 1989 Mexican-Italian avant-garde horror film directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky and written by Jodorowsky along with Claudio Argento and Roberto Leoni. It stars Axel Jodorowsky, Adan Jodorowsky, Teo Jodorowsky, Blanca Guerra, Thelma Tixou and Guy Stockwell. Divided into both a flashback and a flash-forward, the film, which is set in Mexico, tells the story of Fenix, a boy who grew up in a circus, and his life through both adolescence and early adulthood.\n\nThe film starts with a naked figure sitting in a tree in what looks like a mental asylum. Nurses come out to him, bringing a plate of conventional food and also one of a raw fish. As they try to coax him off of his perch, it is the fish that persuades him to come down. As the nurses get him to put on some overalls, the viewer sees that he has a tattoo of a phoenix on his chest.\n\nThe film flashes back into Fenix's childhood, which he spent performing as a \"child magician\" in a circus run by his father Orgo, the knife-thrower, and his mother Concha, a trapeze artist and aerialist. The circus crew also includes, among others, a tattooed woman, who acts as the object of Orgo's knife-throwing feats, her adopted daughter Alma (a hearing-impaired, voiceless mime and tightrope walker whom Fenix adores, with the feeling mutual), Fenix's dwarf friend Aladin, a pack of clowns and a small elephant. Orgo carries on a very public flirtation with the tattooed woman, and their knife-throwing act is heavily sexualized.\n\nConcha is also the leader of a religious cult that considers, as its patron saint, a little girl who was raped and had her arms cut off by two brothers. Their church is about to be bulldozed at the behest of the owner of the land, and the followers make one last stand against the police and the bulldozers. A Roman Catholic Monsignor drives into the conflict, saying that he will prevent its demolition, but after he enters the temple to inspect it he deems it blasphemous and unworthy (the girl worshipped is no saint, he says, and the supposed pool of \"holy blood\" at the center of the edifice contains just red paint), so the demolition is carried out. Fenix leads Concha back to the circus, where she finds out about Orgo's affair, but Orgo, being also a hypnotist, puts Concha in a trance and rapes her.\n\nThe circus elephant then dies, much to Fenix's grief, and a public funeral is conducted, in which the elephant is paraded through the city inside a giant casket. The casket is then dropped into the city dump, where scavengers open it up and proceed to carve up the elephant and take away the meat. Orgo consoles his son by tattooing a spread-eagled phoenix onto his chest, identical to the one on his own chest, using a knife dipped in red ink. This tattoo, Orgo says, will make Fenix a man.\n\nLater on, Concha, during her trapeze act, sees Orgo and the tattooed woman sneak out of the big top. She chases after them and, seeing them sexually engaged, pours a bottle of sulphuric acid onto Orgo's genitals. Orgo retaliates by cutting off both her arms (much like the girl previously venerated). He then walks into the street and slits his own throat. Fenix witnesses this, locked inside a trailer. He then sees the tattooed woman driving off with Alma.\n\nBack in the present, Fenix is taken out to a movie theater, along with other patients, most of whom have Down syndrome. A pimp intercepts them and persuades them to take cocaine and follow him to meet an overweight prostitute. Fenix then spots the Tattooed Woman, who is now a prostitute, and becomes filled with rage. Back in the asylum, Fenix's armless mother Concha calls out for him from the street and he escapes by climbing down a rope from his cell window. The Tattooed Woman is shown trying to prostitute Alma, who runs away and sleeps on the roof of a truck. The Tattooed Woman is then mutilated and killed by the hands of unseen woman.\n\nMother and son go on to perform an act whereby he stands behind her and moves his arms so that they appear to be Concha's arms that are moving. But Concha soon starts to use her son's hands to kill those women whom she deems a threat to her, including a young performer that he kills with a knife-throw, as well as a cross-dressing wrestler, whom he slashes with a Japanese katana sword. A dream sequence subsequently shows that he has killed many more women, all of whose memories haunt him.\n\nAlma finds Fenix and together they plan to run away from Concha and her house. She tries to force Fenix to murder Alma as well, but, after a struggle, he manages to plunge a knife into Concha's stomach. Yet she does not die but taunts him by saying she will always be inside him as she vanishes before his eyes. Through a quick series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Concha actually died after being maimed by Orgo, and that Fenix has actually kept a mannequin of his armless mother for performing on stage and at home, which also now appears in reality to be a thoroughly dilapidated house. He destroys the home-made temple and throws away the mannequin with the help of his imaginary childhood friends, Aladin and the clowns.\n\nAlma proceeds to lead Fenix outside the house where police are waiting and order them to put up their hands. As they both comply, Fenix watches his own hands in awe as he does so. And Fenix's realization that he has finally regained control of them brings him joy and peace.\n\n\n\"Santa Sangre\" did not receive a wide release in the U.S. since its original premiere, only screening at a few theaters familiar with Jodorowsky's previous work. On January 25, 2011, Severin Film gave the film a release on both DVD and Blu-ray with more than \"five hours of exclusive extras\". A UK DVD from Anchor Bay was released in 2004.\n\nThe film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, and generally was critically well received, eventually being ranked 476th on \"Empire magazine's\" 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time. In the United States, it was originally rated NC-17 for \"several scenes of extremely explicit violence\". However, an edited version was released with an R rating for \"bizarre, graphic violence and sensuality, and for drug content\".\n\n\"Santa Sangre\" has received predominantly positive reviews, with a reviewer from the British Film 4 describing it as \"One of Jodorowsky’s finest films\" which \"resonates with all the disturbing power of a clammy nightmare filtered through the hallucinatory lens of 1960s psychedelia.\" Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, and said that he believed it carried the moral message of genuinely opposing evil, rather than celebrating it like most contemporary horror films. Ebert described it as \"a horror film, one of the greatest, and after waiting patiently through countless Dead Teenager Movies, I am reminded by Alejandro Jodorowsky that true psychic horror is possible on the screen – horror, poetry, surrealism, psychological pain and wicked humor, all at once.\" In recognition of its critical success, \"Santa Sangre\" ranks 476th on \"Empire\" magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.\n\nThe film holds an 85% rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 39 reviews; the consensus states: \"Those unfamiliar with Alejandro Jodorowsky's style may find it overwhelming, but \"Santa Sangre\" is a provocative psychedelic journey featuring the director's signature touches of violence, vulgarity, and an oddly personal moral center.\"\n\n"}

Businessmen Anil Wijewardena and Shan Wickremasinghe established the country's first TV station Independent Television Network which started broadcasting on 15 April 1979. The new station remained \"independent\" for less than two months as the government took control of it on 5 June 1979 following a dispute with President J. R. Jayewardene.

The Act required the SLRC maintain taste and decency and not to incite crime and disorder or cause religious or public offence.\n\nThe government maintained a monopoly on television broadcasting until 1992 when private TV stations were allowed to broadcast but they were to be regulated by the SLRC.

It was released in the US by New Line Cinema and became one of the first films to be a commercial success for the distributor. It is notable as the first film to receive an X-rating in the United States solely for violence. In the UK it was originally released as \"Kung Fu Streetfighter\", presumably to avoid confusion with the Charles Bronson movie \"Hard Times\" which was initially released as \"The Streetfighter\" in the UK.\n\n\"The Street Fighter\" inspired two sequels, \"Return of the Street Fighter\" and \"The Street Fighter's Last Revenge\". Additionally, the film \"Sister Street Fighter\" and its sequels is a spin-off series of \"The Street Fighter\". There was another spin-off entitled \"Kozure Satsujin Ken\", which was brought to the US by a different company under the title \"Karate Warriors\". The video game \"The Darkness\" has the entire movie available, to watch, on any of the in-game TVs.\n\nThe film is in the public domain and is available for free download at the Internet Archive. \n\nThe film begins as Takuma (Terry) Tsurugi meets the condemned murderer Tateki Shikenbaru (renamed Junjo in the English dub) while disguised as a Buddhist monk. Tsuguri applies his \"oxygen coma punch\" to Shikenbaru, causing him to collapse just before he can be executed. As Shikenbaru is rushed to a hospital, Tsurugi and his sidekick Rakuda (renamed Ratnose in the English dub) ambush the ambulance and free him. As Tsurugi and Rakuda watch the incident on the news, Shikenbaru's brother Gijun and sister Nachi arrive and plead for more time to pay for Tsurugi's help. Outraged, Tsurugi refuses and attacks the siblings. Gijun accidentally kills himself when Tsurugi dodges his flying kick, causing him to go out of a window, and Nachi is sold into sexual slavery through Renzo Mutaguchi.\n\nMutaguchi and his associates attempt to hire Tsurugi to kidnap Sarai, the daughter of a recently deceased oil tycoon. Tsurugi refuses after discovering that the gangsters are Yakuza. He escapes, but the Yakuza gangsters resolve to kill Tsurugi as well as kidnap Sarai. Tsurugi immediately seeks out Sarai, who is being protected at the Nippon Seibukan dojo by her uncle, Kendō Masaoka, a Karate master. Tsurugi captures Sarai and challenges the entire dojo to a fight. He brutalizes the rank-and-file students before Masaoka fights him to a standstill--then recognizes him as the half-Chinese son of a karate master he knew long ago. Ultimately, Tsurugi offers to protect Sarai, and Masaoka agrees, against Sarai's protests. Meanwhile, the Yakuza's allies in Hong Kong, led by Kowloon boss Dinsau, recruit Shikenbaru to avenge his siblings by killing Tsurugi.\n\nThe gangsters make several attempts to kill Tsurugi before they successfully kidnap Sarai. Tsurugi manages to rescue her, but gets captured himself. Rakuda gives up Sarai's location to save Tsurugi, causing Tsurugi to forsake him. When Tsurugi struggles fighting with a blind samurai working for the Hong Kong gangsters, Rakuda dies by his sword in a reckless attempt at redemption. Tsurugi finally tracks the gangsters down to a shipyard and fights his way through their guards. In the end, Dinsau permits Tsurugi to duel Shikenbaru. Nachi sacrifices herself to give her brother a free shot with a sai, but Tsurugi survives and rips out Shikenbaru's vocal cords. Critically wounded, Tsurugi is helped to his feet by Sarai and Dinsau in the final shot of the film.\n\n\"Note: English-translated names, if given or known, will be in parentheses.\"\n\n\"The Street Fighter\" was the first film to receive an X rating solely for violence. The film was especially controversial because of a scene in which Tsurugi castrates a rapist with his bare hands; it is this scene (among others) that reputedly gained the film its 'X' rating. A similarly violent scene involves Tsurugi delivering a powerful punch to an henchman's head, followed by a cut to an x-ray shot of the skull being completely shattered and blood gushing from the man's mouth. 16 minutes were later edited from the film in order to get an R-rating. This was the version initially released on home video by MGM/CBS Home Video in 1980. Since then, the film was re-released in its entirety. Consequently, the English dub of the uncut version suffers from inconsistencies to the soundtrack quality, as the restored footage was dubbed by a different studio using different voice actors.\n\nIn the English dubbed versions of \"The Street Fighter\" and \"Return of The Street Fighter\", Chiba's character is identified as \"Terry Sugury\" in the credits but dubbed by the voice actors as \"Terry Tsurugi\". In \"The Street Fighter's Last Revenge\", however, the voice actors call him \"Terry Sugury.\" \"Rakuda\" is named \"Ratnose\"; The villain \"Tateki\"'s name is also mistranslated as \"Junjō\".\n\nOn November 7, 2018, it was announced that Shout! Factory has acquired the license of all three films in the series for a Blu-ray release on February 19, 2019 via their Shout! Selects line. It only contains the dub, and its extras are yet to be announced.\n\nIn 1993, the film (and its sequels) received mainstream exposure in North America when they were featured in Tony Scott's \"True Romance\" (written by Quentin Tarantino), which had the two lead characters spending time at a Sonny Chiba \"Street Fighter\" marathon.\n\nQuentin Tarantino listed \"The Street Fighter\" as number 13 on his top 20 grindhouse films list.\n\n"}

Wakes were established in Deritend and in Handsworth in the 15th century where booth drama would have been presented.\n\nThe earliest definite records of dramatic performances in the town are of regular seasonal performances by strolling players in the early 18th century. A booth existed by 1715 in \"The Hinkleys\" – the area bounded by Smallbrook Street and Dudley Street near the site of the current Old Rep theatre – and a second, described as a \"shed of boards\", is recorded a few years later in the meadows that would later be developed as Temple Street. These later developed into the Theatre in Smallbrook Street and the Playhouse in New Street, but at this early date would have presented plays and performances by travelling actors of indifferent quality, who carried their costumes and scenery with them on their backs and announced their performances by beating a drum.\n\nA building \"something like a stable\" in Castle Yard between High Street and Moor Street was used for dramatic performances from 1730. The standard of production in this new venue was reflected in the remarks of William Hutton, writing later in the century: \"here the comedian strutted in painted rags, ornamented with tinsel. The audience raised a noisy laugh, half real and half forced, at three-pence a head.\" Not all of the performances of this era were of such low quality, however: later playbills suggest that George Hallam had visited Birmingham with a company of actors from London, and that a repertoire of good quality was being presented in the town, by 1730 at the latest.\n\nIt was in the 1740s that Birmingham emerged as the home of a distinctive theatrical tradition, which had become well-established by 1750. The town's first permanent theatre was the Moor Street Theatre, which opened in 1740. Though not purpose-built, this was a substantial structure with boxes, a pit, a balcony, two galleries, and significant backstage machinery. This new venue brought a major increase in the quality of drama presented in the town. It was managed during the 1740s by John Ward, whose background lay not with provincial strolling players but with London's fashionable Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre and Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and with the Aungier Street Theatre in Dublin. The Moor Street Theatre featured notable cast-members – David Garrick himself performed at Moor Street in the 1740s – and presented a credible repertoire: the season for 1744 included Shakespeare's \"Othello\", \"Julius Caesar\" and \"The Tempest\", John Vanbrugh's \"The Provok'd Wife\", \"Fair Rosamund\" and \"The Biter Bit\", William Congreve's \"Love for Love\" and \"The Mourning Bride\", and John Rich's \"The Spaniard Outwitted\". Performances were given in costumes \"proper to the play\", reflecting the time and culture in which the drama was set, anticipating Garrick's later reforms at Drury Lane in London.\n\nThe most notable development of the 1740s was John Ward's founding of the Warwickshire Company of Comedians – Birmingham's first indigenous theatre company. Ward was the manager of the Moor Street Theatre in the 1740s and had established the company by 1744, when it is recorded as playing in Stratford-upon-Avon. At a time when any actor outside London was officially \"deemed to be a rogue and a vagabond\" the Birmingham company's performances were of much higher standard than was usual outside London. A reviewer of their performance in Stratford on Avon in 1746 described them as \"much ye best Set I have seen out of London, & in which opinion I am far from being singular\" and the memoirs of the contemporary Irish actor Charles Lee Lewes speak of \"the Great Ward\" who \"has now a very great company at Birmingham: many of them are no less than Londoners\". Many of the actors in his company had experience from London and Dublin and the company's repertoire included works by Congreve, Dryden, Lee, Rowe, Shakespeare, Steele, and Vanbrugh, as well as more populist fare including pantomime, music and dance.\n\nDevelopments in Birmingham's theatrical culture were not confined just to the new theatre. The Playhouse in New Street and the Theatre in Smallbrook Street – successors to booths recorded earlier in the century – continued to operate through the 1740s, though both had disappeared by 1751. Serious plays co-existed with more vulgar entertainments at all Birmingham's theatres – from musical concerts to fire-eating, rope-dancing to ventriloquism – often at the same venue, sometimes even on the same evening. Popular dramatic entertainment much like later music hall was also often held in the town's larger public houses, including the \"George and Dragon\" and the \"Red Lion\" in the Bull Ring, the \"King's Head\" in Digbeth and the \"Roe Buck\" in Cox Street. Though popular these were illegal and often prosecuted by the owners of the more established theatres, who viewed them as unwelcome competition.\n\nThe Licensing Act of 1737 confined drama in England to the two London patent theatres, otherwise forbidding \"every Person who shall for Hire, Gain or Reward, act, represent or perform, any Interlude, Tragedy, Comedy, Opera, Play, Farce, or other entertainment of the stage\" To get round this all Birmingham theatrical venues were licensed by magistrates for the performances of \"Concerts of Music\" under the Disorderly Houses Act 1732, with plays technically being given free of charge during the interval. Such licenses were only available for 60 day periods between June and October, however, as a result of which Birmingham theatres had only summer seasons until the licensing of the Theatre Royal in 1807.\n\nBy 1901 Birmingham had ten theatres. The Tivoli (later the Hippodrome) and the Lyceum (later the Alexandra Theatre) showed melodrama, pantomime, circus and variety acts. The Theatre Royal and the Prince of Wales, which had closed their stock companies, received touring modern and classical drama from leading national actor-managers.\n\nThe outbreak of the Second World War saw the enforced closure of all Birmingham's theatres in anticipation of immediate bombing. Although they were allowed to reopen after a few weeks, the onset of the Birmingham Blitz in 1940 led to a collapse in attendance at evening performances and the return of closure for the majority of theatres. The Birmingham Repertory Theatre was closed for two years from December 1940, and only the Alexandra Theatre would stay open for the entire remaining duration of the war. The most notable theatrical development of the war years were the Plays in the Park, that saw Birmingham's theatre companies working around the threat of evening bombing of the city centre by presenting matinèe performances of drama in the city's parks.\n\nThe opening of the Sutton Coldfield transmitting station in 1949 made Birmingham the first British city outside London to have a television service, and this came to have a severe effect on the city's commercial theatres. Moss Empires closed the Theatre Royal in 1958, with the replacement proposed as part of the ATV Centre never materialising. The Alexandra Theatre was suffering financial problems by 1956, being forced to seek a loan from Birmingham City Council in 1963 and from the Arts Council in 1968. In October 1968 it was bought by the City Council and leased to a non- profit making management trust. The Alex's repertory company was closed in 1974 and the company continued as a receiving house. Moss Empires threatened to close the Hippodrome in 1961 and 1970, but in 1979 sold it to the City Council who in turn leased it to a charitable trust. The Hippodrome's fortunes gradually revived, and by the early 21st century it was selling more tickets than any other single theatre in the country. By the 1980s Birmingham had only three large-scale professional theares, though this was still – jointly with Manchester – the highest number of any English city outside London.\n\nDuring the 70s, mac, then known as the Midlands Arts Centre for Young People had its own professional puppet theatre and resident theatre company, members of the theatre company included Mike Leigh, Brian Blessed and Sir Tony Robinson.\n\nBirmingham Repertory Theatre, commonly known as \"The Rep\" and located next to the Library of Birmingham on Centenary Square, is one of Britain's leading producing theatres. It stages a wide range of performances in its three auditoria in Birmingham – \"The House\" with 825 seats, \"The Studio\" with 300 seats and \"The Door\" with 140 seats – as well as touring nationally and internationally and transferring productions to London's West End. The Rep regularly commissions new work and presented over 130 new plays during the five-year period to 2013.\n\nThe Birmingham Stage Company is the resident company at the 383 seat Old Rep in Station Street, where it performs 5 major productions annually before touring them as far afield as Singapore, Dubai, New York and Sydney. Founded in 1992, it has focused on new and contemporary plays since 1998, producing world premieres by playwrights including Oren Lavie, Paul Lucas, Dominic Leyton, David Mamet and Reg Cribb.\n\nThe Blue Orange Theatre is a small fringe theatre based in the Jewellery Quarter, with a flexible theatre space seating between 90 and 100 people. Although primarily a producing theatre it also hosts visiting companies and runs comedy nights, workshops and courses.\n\nThe Alexandra Theatre and the Birmingham Hippodrome host large-scale touring productions, while professional drama is performed on a wide range of stages across the city, including the Old Rep, the Crescent Theatre, the Custard Factory, the Old Joint Stock Theatre, the Blue Orange Theatre, the Drum in Aston and the \"mac\" in Cannon Hill Park.During the 70s, mac, then known as the Midlands Arts Centre for Young People had its own professional puppet theatre and resident theatre company, members of the theatre company included Mike Leigh, Brian Blessed and Sir Tony Robinson.\n\nTouring theatre companies in Birmingham include the experimental Stan's Cafe, the politically radical Banner Theatre, the Birmingham Stage Company and the Maverick Theatre Company.\n\nThe Birmingham Royal Ballet is one of the United Kingdom's three major ballet companies and the only one based outside London. It is resident at the Birmingham Hippodrome and tours extensively nationally and internationally. The company's associated ballet school – Elmhurst School for Dance in Edgbaston – is the oldest vocational dance school in the country.\n\nThe Birmingham Opera Company under artistic director Graham Vick has developed an international reputation for its avant-garde productions, which often take place in factories, abandoned buildings and other found spaces around the city. In 2010 it was described by \"The Guardian\" as \"far and away the most powerful example that I've experienced in this country of how and why opera can still matter.\" More conventional seasons by Welsh National Opera and other visiting opera companies take place regularly at the Birmingham Hippodrome.\n\n"}

Today it is often called Chinese opera although this normally refers specifically to the more well-known forms such as Beijing Opera and Cantonese Opera, there have been many other forms of theatre in China.\n\nThere are references to theatrical entertainments in China as early as the Shang Dynasty; they often involved happiness, mimes, and acrobatic displays.\n\nThe Tang Dynasty is sometimes known as \"The Age of 1000 Entertainments\". During this era, Ming Huang formed an acting school known as The Pear Garden to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical. That is why actors are commonly called \"Children of the Pear Garden.\"\n\nDuring the Dynasty of Empress Ping, shadow puppetry first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Pekingese (northern) and Cantonese (southern). The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the puppets, as opposed to the type of play performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather (usually taken from the belly of a peacock). They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the seventh century before becoming a tool of the government.\n\nIn the Song Dynasty, there were many popular plays involving acrobatics and music. These developed in the Yuan Dynasty into a more sophisticated form known as \"zaju\", with a four- or five-act structure. Yuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, the best known of which is Beijing Opera, which is still popular today.\n\nXiangsheng is a certain traditional Chinese comedic performance in the forms of monologue or dialogue or naralouge or salalouge or cococlouge.\n\nChinese performers usually clap with the audience at the end of a performance; the return applause signals \"thank you\" to the audience.\n\nChinese drama is an acting style that has influenced the world at that time. Well, Chinese drama usually contains the following: a protagonist, an antagonist, a heroine, and a sidekick (which is usually not that smart). The protagonist usually gets in trouble with the antagonist and gets kidnapped, and the heroine stands by, but can not do anything. The antagonist's sidekick may accidentally release the protagonist because the sidekick is not that smart, and later the sidekick may get killed for doing that. The antagonist usually gets caught at the end of the play.\n\nLike the Chinese play Romance of the Three Kingdoms, there is a certain style when acting Chinese drama and plays.\n\n\nModern Chinese theatre and drama has changed quite a lot compared to the past. The influences of the modern world affected the form of music/ theatre/ drama the Chinese were having. The rapid development of the country made theater not has important, as it started to pay focus on its economic environment, not its culture. Although some elderly Chinese try to protect and make the old Chinese theater tradition not fade out, but the fading out of the traditional Chinese is unavoidable. The current Chinese theater has been developed to a new form: people do not watch plays from theater, they watch it at homes on their TV. In addition to music theater, the modern world inspired new forms of drama, including what became known as the spoken drama (huaju 话剧) of the Western stage.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30809382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30809382", "title": "Yolk magazine", "text": "Yolk magazine\n\nYolk was a quarterly magazine for young Asian Americans. It was published by InformAsian Media, Inc. (IAMI) between 1994 and 2004, and it was headquartered in Alhambra, California, in Greater Los Angeles. The later incarnations of the magazine were titled \"Yolk: GenerAsian Next 2.0\".\n\nIt was founded in 1994 by Tommy Tam, Tin Yen, and Amy Lee Tu. Tommy Tam was in charge of operations, Tin Yen was the graphic designer/art director, and Amy Tu oversaw the financial aspects of the magazine.\n\nBased in Los Angeles, \"Yolk\"s reflection of its generation combines sections on fashion, entertainment and music, book reviews, with occasional in-your-face attacks on our society's misunderstandings of Asian culture. The magazine's premise is that there is something common to Japanese, Korean and Chinese Americans, as well as Vietnamese, Filipinos, Indians and other Asian American groups.\n\n\"Yolk\"s first editor was Philip Chung, and managing editor, Larry Tazuma, came up with the magazine's name. \"An egg yolk is yellow,\" he said,\" and so is the nominal color of Asian people's skin, regardless of nationality.\" \"YOLK draws a strong reaction. But it simply stands for the color of our skin,\" he says. \"It's what connects all Asians.\" Performance artist and professor Alex Luu served as its editor and graphic designer Max Medina/Mystery Parade served as the Art Designer of \"YOLK\". Staff writers include XD Lim and Margaret Rhee.\n\nAs the business grew, operations expanded into the clothing business. YOLK was well known for producing its line of Got Rice? t-shirts under the Brand Fury name. Popular sellers included phrases such as Got Rice?, Got Sushi?, Got Adobo? and Got Pho?\n\nCirculation reached a high of 50,000 in 2000 and targeted English-fluent college-educated Asian Americans coming from various cultures. In 2001, Stanley Lim came in as the new publisher of the magazine. He proposed a new formula heavy on \"guy stuff\"—reviews of video games and tech gadgets, interviews with models and more bikini-clad women, both on the cover and throughout the pages. But \"Yolk\" was not able to sustain success, and folded in 2004 after a 10-year, 31-issue run.\n\nTommy Tam is currently the VP of Marketing at Dream Tube Entertainment. Tin Yen is still involved with graphic design today and has taught at UCLA Extension in the graphic design program. He founded creative agency TYS Creative, Inc. Amy Lee Tu is currently the Head of Marketing at Indomina Releasing.\n\nAs \"Yolk\" was closing, Honda Motor Co. offered a four month advertising contract. Lim and the editorial staff changed the publication into a web publication, and asked Honda to provide online advertising banners in lieu of print advertisements. Honda agreed to the change, and Chopblock.com became active.\n\nThe cover subjects have been well-known celebrities and other notable Asian Americans in the Entertainment field.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
