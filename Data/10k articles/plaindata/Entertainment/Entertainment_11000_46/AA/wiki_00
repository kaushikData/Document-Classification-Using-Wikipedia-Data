The Millennium Concert is a live album by the American hard rock band Kiss. It was released on November 21, 2006 as part of the \"Kiss Alive! 1975–2000\" box set.\n\nIt was recorded on December 31, 1999 at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, Canada and included songs that had never before been performed by the original lineup (\"Heaven's on Fire\", \"I Love It Loud\" and \"Lick It Up\").\n\nIt was originally intended to be released as \"Alive IV\" in 2000 but was shelved when Kiss' parent label Mercury was swallowed by the Universal/Vivendi merger. However, the album's version of \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" was included in \"The Box Set\" which was released on November 20, 2001. Although Universal later agreed to Kiss using Mercury to release what would become The Millennium Concert as \"Alive IV\", it was shelved indefinitely and the band would release the \"\" album released on Kiss Records/Sanctuary Records in 2003. It was finally released on November 21, 2006 as part of the \"Kiss Alive! 1975–2000\" box set.\n\nAn edition of the box set exclusive to Best Buy was advertised as including two exclusive bonus tracks (2,000 Man and God of Thunder) on \"The Millennium Concert\" disc. But due to an error, Best Buy only sold the standard box set that did not have the exclusive bonus tracks. In an attempt to correct this, a replacement disc was produced and small quantities were shipped to Best Buy locations where the discs were given out to customers who came back to complain that their box did not include the promised extra tracks.\n\nAnother bonus track, \"Detroit Rock City\", was released as an exclusive to the iTunes edition of the box set.\n\nIn October 14, 2014 \"The Millennium Concert\" was released on vinyl. This edition was the first release to include the entire concert (except for \"Cold Gin\" and \"Shock Me\" which remain unreleased).\n\n"}

The dance uses 70 ritual gestures to represent war, farming, hunting, courtship and other aspects of traditional life.\n\nThe Tujia nationality Baishou dance in Xiangxi, Hunan province best reflects the ethnic flavor and ancient customs of the Tujia nationality. It is popular in Longshan county, Baojing county and Yongshun county, Xiangxi Tujia-Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hunan province. The dance is usually performed from the third to the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. It originates from an ancestor worship ceremony and dates back nearly 1,000 years ago, according to the broken stele in the Temple of Eight Clan Leaders (Qing Dynasty) and the county annals.\nThe Tujia nationality baishou dance integrates singing, dancing, music and opera elements. It presents numerous topics concerning history and human existence, including the creation of the world, human reproduction, migration, hunting & fishing, sericulture & weaving, slash-and-burn cultivation, ancient stories, myths and legends, and daily life. The dance uses ritual gestures. Dancers' movements and postures are powerful and aesthetic. They wave one hand, wave two hands, wave hand(s) when circling around, or wave hand(s) with foot movements. The dance, usually performed on level ground, can be classified into grand baishou and small-scale baishou. The grand baishou is performed by over 1,000 dancers when offering sacrifices to Tujia ancestors and is watched by over 10,000 spectators; the small-scale baishou is performed on a small scale when offering sacrifices to ancestors with the same family name.\nThe music of the dance incorporates vocal accompaniment (starting song and baishou song) and musical accompaniment (drum and gong). The song changes flexibly according to the content and movements of the dance. Dancers' movements and postures indicate power and freedom and feature turning, bending knees, shaking, and lowering the body. The dance is valuable for studying the history, war, religion, migration, farming, life, courtship and folk customs of the Tujia nationality. \n"}
{"id": "670380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=670380", "title": "Bob and Doug McKenzie", "text": "Bob and Doug McKenzie\n\nBob and Doug McKenzie are a pair of fictional Canadian brothers who hosted \"Great White North\", a sketch which was introduced on \"SCTV\" for the show's third season when it moved to CBC Television in 1980. Bob is played by Rick Moranis and Doug is played by Dave Thomas. Although created originally as filler to both satisfy and mock network Canadian content demands, the duo became a pop culture phenomenon in both Canada and the United States.\n\nThe characters were later revived for an animated series, \"Bob & Doug\", which premiered on Global in 2009.\n\n\"Great White North\" (originally known as \"Kanadian Korner\") is a panel show that played upon Canadian stereotypes. Bob and Doug, two dim-witted beer-swilling brothers wearing heavy winter clothing and touques, would comment on various elements of Canadian life and culture, frequently employing the interjection \"Eh?\" and derisively calling each other \"hoser.\" Among the topics discussed were snow routes, the Canadian-built robot arm on the Space Shuttle, the inappropriateness of bedtime stories about dog fights, flat tires, and \"why there aren't enough parking spaces at take-out donut shops.\"\n\nThe sketch was conceived when \"SCTV\" moved to the CBC television network. Due to the difference in the amount of time allocated for commercials, each episode to be broadcast on that network was two minutes longer than those syndicated to the United States. The CBC network heads asked the show's producers to add specifically identifiably Canadian content for those two minutes. Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas thought that this was a ridiculous request, given that the show had been taped in Canada, with a mostly Canadian cast and crew, for two years. The request inspired them to create a parody that would incorporate every aspect of the humorous stereotype of Canadians.\n\nThe segments were videotaped at the end of a day's shooting, with just Thomas and Moranis and a single camera operator. The sketches were for the most part improvised on the set, after which they would select the best ones for use on the program.\n\nMoranis recalled, \"We went on the stage with no preparation, and did 15 [sketches]. Two of them were lousy, in three we cracked up and fell apart... maybe six were keepers.\" Added Dave Thomas in a 2000 interview, \"Rick and I used to sit in the studio, by ourselves – almost like happy hour – drink real beers, cook back bacon, literally make hot snack food for ourselves while we improvised and just talked. It was all very low key and stupid, and we thought, 'Well, they get what they deserve. This is their Canadian content. I hope they like it.'\"\n\nTo their shock, the comedians found that this filler material had become the most popular part of the show. Though initially intended for Canadian TV only, some of the two-minute \"Great White North\" segments would find their way into U.S. versions of the 30-minute shows due to a shortage of content that week. When NBC ordered the 90-minute shows for the 1981 season, they specifically cited good affiliate feedback on the \"two dumb Canadian characters\" and requested that the characters be included in every program.\n\nThey rode the crest of a fad, peaking in 1982-83, that produced one comedy album, \"The Great White North\", and a movie, \"Strange Brew\". The album released by Anthem Records in Canada and Mercury Records in the US, went platinum in sales, won a Grammy nomination and broke the top ten on Billboard's Top LPs and Tapes list in March, 1982. It is noted for the song \"Take Off\" which featured fellow Canadian Geddy Lee of the rock group Rush chorusing between the McKenzies' banter. On this album, they also sing their own improvised version of \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\", which is frequently played on the radio around the holidays in both Canada and the United States. While hugely popular in the U.S., the album was also #1 in Canada for six weeks, suggesting that Canadians appreciated the duo as an affectionate self-parody.\n\nThe \"Strange Brew\" movie was released by MGM in 1983. While receiving only minimal praise from critics, it performed fairly well at the box office, earning $8.5 million in the U.S. alone to easily cover its skinny $5 million budget. Subsequent to its initial theatrical release in 1983, \"Strange Brew\" was released by MGM in both Beta and VHS formats and subsequently re-packaged and re-released on VHS and Laser disc by Turner which acquired the MGM library in 1986, then also several times on VHS and DVD by Warner Brothers which acquired the library when Time Warner merged with Turner in 1996. \"Strange Brew\" continued to perform for Warner Brothers as a DVD title most likely because of the strong college cult following for Bob and Doug.\n\nA second album, a \"soundtrack\" to their movie \"Strange Brew\", was released in 1983. The album featured dialogue and music from the film, as well as new skits made specifically for the album that centered around the movie. The lead off track was appropriately entitled \"This Isn't Our Second Album\". The album sold poorly and was out-of-print soon after.\n\nThe sketch's signature \"Coo roo coo coo, coo coo coo coo\" theme, according to Dave Thomas in an interview on \"\", is an exaggeration of the flute music used in 60-second Canadian television nature vignettes, such as \"Hinterland Who's Who\".\n\nThe duo had a total of 41 original segments on SCTV. Presumably filmed several at a time, most \"Great White North\" segments featured one two-minute sketch per SCTV episode. 25 segments were aired in the third season (1980–81).\n\nMost of Season 4, Cycle 1 (1981) was made up of \"Great White North\" repeat segments. The only new appearances were in episodes 4/1-2 and 4/1-9, the final episode of the cycle. The final episode included a wraparound storyline which heavily featured the characters.\n\nGrowing in popularity, the characters returned for nine new segments in the second cycle of season 4. Cycle 2 (1981–82) featured a new \"Great White North\" segment in each episode.\n\nSeason 4, Cycle 3 (1982) was the last season to feature the characters. The first episode's plot revolves around the growing popularity of Bob and Doug, and they are given their own variety show on \"SCTV\", which turns into a catastrophe. The characters returned in the next episode for a new segment in their traditional studio set, but it had been cut to one minute (the episode's storyline owing the reduced air time to their disastrous variety show). The two are then featured in three more new segments, each back to two minutes long, before Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas left \"SCTV\" to film \"Strange Brew\".\n\nThe duo revived the act in two award-winning television commercials for Pizza Hut in 1984 and 1986 and a two-year campaign for the Molson Brewing Company in 1999 and 2000 consisting of more than a dozen television and radio commercials which aired nationally in the U.S. and also a series of commercials for Mr. Lube which aired in Canada in 2002. Featured as a sponsor of the \"Two-Four Anniversary\", a series of Red Cap Ale commercials featured the duo in 2007 along with collectible \"stubbies\" featuring the characters on the bottles.\n\nMcFarlane Toys produced Bob and Doug McKenzie action figures in September 2000.\n\nIn the 2000 video game \"\", two characters appear in the Icy Peak level whose names are Bob and Doug. The level is a land of ice and snow, and there are references in certain areas of the level to ice skating and ice hockey, as well as a use of the phrase \"Take off, hoser!\". The characters the player interacts with in the level seem to speak with Canadian accents.\n\nIn 2003, the fastest computer in Canada, which is used by the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Toronto, was named after Bob and Doug. The $900,000 computer is being used to simulate supermassive black holes and collisions of galaxies. The machine, nicknamed McKenzie, has 268 gigabytes of memory and 40 terabytes of disk space, and consists of two master nodes (Bob and Doug), 256 compute nodes, and eight development nodes.\n\nThey played a variant of the act for the Walt Disney Pictures animated feature film \"Brother Bear\" and its sequel, with their characters being the voices of a pair of goofy bull moose named Rutt and Tuke. They also recorded a commentary for the movie that is seen on the DVD.\n\nA new special, \"Bob & Doug McKenzie's Two-Four Anniversary\", aired on May 20, 2007, on CBC Television. It is a retrospective on the history of the characters and their popularity, featuring interviews with various celebrities, classic clips, and new material featuring the pair. It includes an introduction by former Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin and a cameo appearance by Rush lead singer Geddy Lee. On November 20, 2007, the special was released on DVD. The DVD, re-edited by Thomas himself, was twice as long as the broadcast and featured several classic McKenzie sketches from SCTV in their entirety, new footage filmed on the Great White North set and an hour's worth of bonus features. A Bob and Doug McKenzie bottle opener was included in every DVD.\n\nIn 2007, on Rush's \"Snakes & Arrows\" tour, a short film of Bob and Doug McKenzie was shown as an intro to the song \"The Larger Bowl\".\n\nAnimax Entertainment, whose interactive division is currently headed by Dave Thomas, began producing a new animated series for the Global Television Network based on the characters debuting on April 19, 2009, simply entitled \"Bob & Doug\". Thomas reprised the character of Doug in the new series. Moranis chose not to voice the character of Bob. The part was instead voiced by Dave Coulier. Moranis was, however, involved in the series as an executive producer. The show aired 15 episodes.\n\nIn June 2017 it was announced that Moranis and Thomas would be performing a live reunion show at the Second City in Toronto to raise money for Thomas' nephew Jake who suffered a spinal cord injury earlier that year. The show featured other SCTV alumni including Dan Aykroyd, Eugene Levy, and Martin Short.\n\nThe SYFY network show \"Z-Nation\" Season 4, Episode 8 - 'Crisis of Faith', featured the main characters entering Canada, and running into RCMP officers, a Hockey team bearing the Canada logo and of course, zombies very reminiscent of Bob & Doug McKenzie. The cast members who confront the look-alikes used the GWN catch phrases \"eh\", and \"hoser\" among others.\n\nIn Dave Thomas's behind-the-scenes book on \"SCTV\", he reports that he and Moranis disliked the characters because they felt the network forced the characters on them and that they, as actors, were overly identified with the dimwitted, beer-drinking duo. However, in an interview accompanying the \"Two-Four Anniversary\" premiere, Thomas credited the McKenzie Brothers as a successful comedic creation of which he was quite proud.\n\n\n\n"}

An indirect sequel, \"\", was released for the same platforms in 2000.\n\nThe game stars cartoon character Bugs Bunny who finds and activates a time machine (mistaking it for a carrot juice dispenser) after taking a wrong turn at Albuquerque, intending to go to Pismo Beach. He ends up in Nowhere, home of a sorcerer named Merlin Munroe. Merlin then informs Bugs that he is lost in time and that he must travel through five different eras of time in order to collect clock symbols and golden carrots that will allow him to return to the present.\n\nThe objective of this game is to collect time clocks to progress through different eras via the time machine. In Nowhere, which acts as a tutorial level, Bugs Bunny will learn the basic moves he needs to use to progress through the game. He can kick, jump, pick up objects, roll, jump into rabbit holes to move underground, tiptoe to avoid alerting other enemies, climb ropes, and use his rabbit ears like propellers to slowly descend to the ground from high places. Bugs can also move some objects to get to certain places. Enemies in the game are mostly simple to beat. Some can be defeated with a kick or a jump, while others may require Bugs to be chased by an enemy until they run out of breath, then they can be kicked in the back. There are also special abilities for Bugs to learn from Merlin much later as he progresses through the game.\n\nWhile in the time machine, there are five different eras (spanning 21 levels in total) for Bugs Bunny to visit. They are the Stone Age, Pirate Years, The 1930s, Medieval Period, and Dimension X. Each level has clock symbols and golden carrots for Bugs to find in the game. There are also normal carrots for Bugs to pick up, which act as a form of defense similar to rings from Sonic the Hedgehog. Carrots can be collected by finding them scattered in a level or defeating an enemy. If Bugs gets hit, he will lose 3 carrots. He can hold up to 99 carrots. There are some levels that require a full amount of carrots in order to play them. After completing a level, Merlin will appear and the player can decide if they wish to save their progress up to that point. At the end of each era, Bugs must confront and defeat a boss character to unlock the next era.\n\nIn late 2017, beta screenshots of the game surfaced on YouTube, from \"Playstation Zone Volume 3\". The screenshots showcased a drastically different art style from the final game, for instance a completely redesigned different 1st level. Although, level assets are used in the final version of the game. Beta footage from the same source surfaced a year later.\n\n\nThe game was met with average to very mixed reception, as GameRankings gave it a score of 68.33% for the PlayStation version, and 53.75% for the PC version.\n"}
{"id": "53842713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53842713", "title": "Call of Duty: WWII", "text": "Call of Duty: WWII\n\nCall of Duty: WWII is a first-person shooter video game developed by Sledgehammer Games and published by Activision. It was released worldwide on November 3, 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is the fourteenth main installment in the \"Call of Duty\" series and the first title in the series to be set primarily during World War II since \"\" in 2008.\n\nThe game's campaign is set in the European theatre and is centered around a squad in the 1st Infantry Division following their battles on the Western Front and set mainly in the historical events of Operation Overlord. The player controls Ronald \"Red\" Daniels, who has squadmates who can supply the player with extra ammunition, health, or grenades; none of these are automatically replenished in the campaign. The multiplayer mode features map locations not seen in the campaign. The mode also features the new Divisions system, replacing the create-a-class system that previous games in the series used. A social hub, Headquarters, was also implemented into the game, allowing for players to interact with each other.\n\nSledgehammer Games were interested in bringing the series back to World War II after developing their previous title, \"\" (2014), which featured advanced movements and futuristic warfare technology. Studio head Michael Condrey stated that he was unsure if a World War II game would feel right after creating a futuristic title like \"Advanced Warfare\", but the developers ultimately decided to create a game in this time period. They also chose to include \"atrocities\" and Nazi extermination camps apparent during this time period in the campaign mode in order to deliver an authentic war story.\n\nUpon release, the game received generally positive reviews from critics, with many appreciating the return to the franchise's World War II roots. Praise was given towards its story, the combat support of squad members and return of the health bar in single-player, visuals, Zombies mode, and multiplayer. However, it was criticized for the single-player's lack of innovation and similarity to past games set in the same era. The game was a commercial success, creating $500 million of revenue within just three days of its release. It became the highest-grossing console game of 2017 in North America, generating over $1 billion of revenue by the end of the year.\n\nSimilar to its predecessors, \"Call of Duty: WWII\" is a first-person shooter game. It removes the advanced system of movement present in the two previous \"Call of Duty\" titles, which included double jumping and wall running. Instead, it features a return of traditional movement to the series, taking it back to a \"boots on the ground\" gameplay style. The game features an unlimited sprint mechanic, seen in the previous two titles. Instead of a \"slide\" movement mechanic, which allowed players to slide quickly on the ground, \"WWII\" features a \"hit-the-deck\" mechanic that allows the player to leap forward and throw themselves on the ground in order to get to cover quickly, similarly to a previous mechanic known as \"dolphin dive\" in Treyarch's \"\" and \"\".\n\n\"WWII\" is the first title since the original game and \"\" not to feature health regeneration in the campaign. Instead, players must find health packs scattered throughout levels, or rely on their medic squadmate to provide health packs. Other members of the player's squad can provide ammunition, grenades, call in mortar strikes, or spot enemies and reveal their position in form of silhouettes. In certain sections of the game, enemy soldiers in the campaign can be captured, and wounded allies can be dragged to cover. In some parts of the campaign, players are able to control vehicles.\n\nThe multiplayer mode for \"Call of Duty: WWII\" was revealed on E3 2017, which took place from June 13–15. Sledgehammer Games announced features such as the new headquarters social space, divisions, war mode and the return to \"boots-on-the-ground\" gameplay. Players who pre-order the game were invited to a closed beta, which was released initially for the PlayStation 4, and later released on other platforms.\n\nIn online multiplayer matches, players are randomly assigned either to Allies or Axis side. On Allies side, players can play as soldiers in American, British, Soviet, or French Resistance armies. On the Axis side, players play exclusively as the Wehrmacht and not Waffen-SS in an effort to avoid \"glorifying\" Nazi extremists. When explaining this decision, Glen Schofield, co-founder and co-studio head at Sledgehammer, said \"The big distinction that Germans still make today is that between the German military and the Nazis. We made sure we made that distinction in the game, that the Germans were doing their duty\".\n\nInstead of the usual create-a-class system, \"WWII\" features Divisions. Players can choose one out of five divisions, each with their own different basic combat training, division training and weapon skills. Players need to progress through ranks in divisions in order to use additional perks, in addition to a global perk system named Basic Training. The divisions featured in the game are:\n\nIn April 6, Sledgehammer Games announced an overhaul to the Divisions system, which includes massive changes to the meta of the system: Division-specific weapon skills are selectable as attachments for the corresponding weapon classes rather than being tied to the Divisions (with LMG bipods and sniper sharpshooter abilities being available by default), and several Division trainings are switched out/adjusted to better promote their recommended playstyle, without imposing limitation of customization on the players. Other global changes include allowing suppressors on pistols, usage of rocket launchers without needing the Launched basic training, and infinite sprinting.\n\n\"WWII\" also features Headquarters mode, which acts as a social space in the game. The hub is set on the Omaha Beach in Normandy, three days after the invasion when Allies retake the beach and turn it into a base. 48 players can be in the Headquarters at a time, and take part in various activities. For example, players can watch other players open loot boxes while in the Headquarters. There is a firing range in the hub, where all players can practice their shooting skills with all weapons, as well as a field where they can test scorestreaks. There are also areas where players can engage in \"1v1\" fights, as other players watch the duels.\n\nThe end-game \"killcam\" highlight shown at the end of multiplayer matches has been changed to \"Bronze Star\", which show kills \"deemed most impressive\" (counted by most points gained in a row). The exception to this is the Search & Destroy game mode, which does not use Bronze Star killcam. Search & Destroy uses a final killcam, showing the last kill in the round.\n\nA new game mode, War, is introduced as a \"narrative-driven\" multiplayer game mode, developed in partnership with Raven Software. In War, two teams of 6 players perform objectives as either the Allied or Axis faction, inspired by some of the iconic World War II battles, such as storming Normandy on D-Day as the Allied, or defending the Normandy bunker as the Axis in the map Operation Neptune. In addition to War, popular game modes such as Team Deathmatch, Domination and Hardpoint return, as well as Gridiron, a \"boots on the ground\" variation of Uplink, which was originally introduced by Sledgehammer Games in \"\". Several fan-favorite modes, as well as new modes, are introduced in time-limited events throughout the season, such as Demolition or Infected.\n\n\"WWII\" includes a zombies cooperative game mode, similar to previous entries by Treyarch and Infinity Ward, with its own original storyline set in alternate history and separate from the campaign. The game mode, dubbed \"Nazi Zombies\" in reference to its first iteration in Treyarch's \"\", is also set in the events of World War II, as the Third Reich makes a desperate attempt to turn the tide of the war by creating an undead army in the final stages of the war. While the mode is based on science-fiction and is a fictional take on the war, Sledgehammer Games co-founder Michael Condrey said that the story of the mode is based on some \"real events\". He also revealed that the experience is similar to \"Dead Space\", a third person shooter horror video game directed by both Condrey and Schofield during their work time at EA Redwood Shores.\n\nIn regards to gameplay, \"Nazi Zombies\" retains the wave-based survival formula that have been used in all previous Zombies entries, with new additions. A class system is introduced, where players can opt for one of four combat roles: Offense, Control, Medic and Support, which provide different in-game abilities. Class loadouts are also included, with equippable Raven Mods, which are perks similar to the multiplayer mode. Sledgehammer Games also attempted to rationalize some of the popular mechanics, such as weapon wallbuys and currencies, with realistic explanation that fit within the lore of the game mode. \"Nazi Zombies\" includes a hint system, where portions of the main story quest are given directional hints for players to find and progress. In regards to the story quest, Sledgehammer's creative director Cameron Dayton reveals that there is a \"casual path\" for new and casual players where they can progress with the story, while a \"hardcore\" path, which is considered the official canon, exists with hidden objectives, and expands more on the story beyond what the casual path contains.\n\nOn June 6, 1944, U.S. Army Private First Class Ronald \"Red\" Daniels (Brett Zimmerman) of the 1st Infantry Division takes part in the Normandy landings with his platoon, consisting of Private First Class Robert Zussman (Jonathan Tucker), Private Drew Stiles (Kevin Coubal), Technician Fifth Grader Frank Aiello (Jeff Schine), Technical Sergeant William Pierson (Josh Duhamel) and First Lieutenant Joseph Turner (Jeffrey Pierce). Zussman is stabbed by a German soldier, resulting in his hospitalization for several weeks.\n\nZussman returns to duty in time for Operation Cobra, where American forces successfully push to reclaim the town of Marigny. The platoon is ordered by Colonel Davis (Matt Riedy) to conduct an operation with British Special Operations Executive officers Major Arthur Crowley (David Alpay) and Vivian Harris (Helen Sadler) to intercept a German armored train carrying V2-rockets. Daniels and Zussman successfully derail the train before being escorted back to their squad by French Resistance leader Camille \"Rousseau\" Denis (Bella Dayne).\n\nA week later, Rousseau and Crowley infiltrate a German garrison in Paris to retrieve explosives in preparation for the platoon's assault upon it. Midway through, Rousseau kills SS-und Polizeiführer Heinrich (J. Paul Boehmer) in retaliation for his murder of her family. The platoon liberates Paris.\n\nTwo months later, the platoon enters Aachen, and is saved from a German attack by support from tank commander Staff Sergeant Augustine Pérez (Christian Lanz). They are ordered to take over a German-occupied hotel. They discover civilians inside the hotel, and Turner orders their evacuation, to Pierson's dismay. A young girl named Anna (Lilith Max) goes missing, and Daniels rescues her. German soldiers open fire on a truck carrying the civilians, killing Anna's older sister. Pierson sends the truck away without protection, creating a rift with Turner.\n\nAt the Battle of Hürtgen Forest, the platoon is ordered to take Hill 493. Turner splits the platoon into two groups; Pierson and Zussman are tasked with advancing towards the hill, while Turner and Daniels cover them until they can meet at the bottom. Turner's squad soon receives a transmission revealing that Pierson ordered an attack on the hill against Turner's orders, forcing Turner to join in. The platoon destroys artillery positions, but the Germans counterattack with a Tiger II tank. Daniels is knocked out trying to disable the tank, which is destroyed by Pérez. Turner is fatally wounded rescuing Daniels, and orders Daniels to abandon him while he covers the platoon's escape. In the aftermath of Turner's death, Pierson becomes head of the platoon and makes Daniels his second-in-command, promoting him to Corporal.\n\nAt the height of the Battle of the Bulge, the platoon is surrounded by Germans. Daniels meets an African-American technician, Howard (Russell Richardson), who helps the platoon contact air support. The platoon captures several German soldiers, and discovers that the Germans plan to destroy a bridge at Remagen, the last bridge over the Rhine. After destroying the explosives in transit, Pierson orders the platoon to attack a nearby air base to destroy the remaining explosives. The attack fails, resulting in Daniels and Zussman being surrounded by enemy troops. Daniels is saved by Howard, while Zussman is captured and taken to a German prisoner of war camp, Stalag IX-B. Daniels disobeys Pierson and attempts to pursue the German truck carrying Zussman, but ends up injuring himself in the process and letting the truck escape. He is hospitalized, with Pierson denying him from the platoon. In Stalag IX-B, Zussman is interrogated on his Jewish heritage by SS officer Metz (George Regout), is beaten and sent to a concentration camp.\n\nAfter recovering for eight weeks, Daniels learns from Davis about the events that changed Pierson in the Battle of Kasserine Pass: instead of recklessly leading his men to their deaths, like everyone thought, he risked his and his men's lives in vain to save part of his platoon that was trapped. Daniels later confronts Pierson in his tent and tears up his honorable discharge papers in order to rejoin the platoon. They successfully capture the last bridge over the Rhine. The platoon heads into Germany, liberating concentration camps in search of Zussman, eventually reaching the Berga concentration camp, which they find abandoned; the camp's survivors were sent on a death march. Daniels finds and saves Zussman by killing Metz before he can execute him.\n\nAt the end of the war, Daniels parts ways with his platoon and returns to Texas, reuniting with his wife and newborn son. He visits the grave of his older brother, Paul (Chris Browning), who died while fighting a wolf when Red failed to shoot it in time. He places his Bronze Star medal on the grave, saying that his brother deserves it for teaching him how to fight for himself and for his brothers.\n\nAustrian engineer Marie Fischer (Katheryn Winnick) is sent on a mission to her hometown village of Mittelburg, Bavaria by her commanding officer, Major Hank Rideau (Darin De Paul), to retrieve lost artifacts stolen by the Nazis for experimentation, as well as rescue her brother, Klaus, who provided the information. Klaus has been unwillingly working with their lead scientist Peter Straub (Udo Kier) and weapons expert Colonel Heinz Richter (Tomm Voss) on a project to exploit a new energy dubbed \"Geistkraft\" (literal translation: ‘Spiritforce’) to assist the Nazi party's war efforts. Marie is accompanied by Scottish history professor turned art thief Drostan Hynd (David Tennant), Art Historian turned French Resistance fighter Olivia Durant (Élodie Yung) and United States Army captain Jefferson Potts (Ving Rhames), all of whom have significant knowledge on the stolen arts and relics. However, on their train ride to Mittelburg, the group is attacked by an unidentified colossal being. Marie is stranded from the others, and finds herself taking temporary refuge at a small house nearby, where she holds out against hordes of dead German soldiers reanimated by Geistkraft, until she is able to make her way to the village.\n\nAfter reuniting with the other three, Marie and the crew proceed further down into the village's hidden bunker, where Straub has set up his laboratory. There, they fend off against Straub's undead horde, as well as Richter, whose obsession on weaponization of Geistkraft puts him at odds with Straub. Eventually, the group recovers the artifact, the Hilt of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa's Sword. They then encounter the creature from earlier, a humanoid-shaped amalgam of numerous body parts sewn and stitched together, dubbed the Panzermörder (literal translation: 'Armor Killer'), with Klaus fused into the creature's chest. Using special magnetized batteries, the group manages to stun the Panzermörder and attach the batteries onto it. Richter's zeppelin, flying above the village, attempts to pull the batteries back, which pulls the creature along as well. The Panzermörder struggles to escape, and destroys the zeppelin and itself, freeing Klaus from its body. The Hilt's power somehow revives Klaus, but in a seemingly possessed state, he staggers into the village while ignoring Marie's pleas. He tells the crew to prevent \"the Emperor\"'s return, before activating a fire trap, disappearing in the engulfing flame.\n\nDays later, the crew receives intel of Straub's sighting at the islands of Heligoland, where he has been storing his undead army. They travel to the island in pursuit of Straub, as well as the next piece of Barbarossa's Sword. The crew comes into struggle with the Nazi Kriegsmarine forces protecting the island as well as Straub's latest undead creations, as he prepares for an assault on Britain. Upon solving several ancient riddles, they find a ritual chamber dedicated to the goddess Nerthus, where they acquire the Pommel of Barbarossa's Sword. The crew then calls the British Royal Air Force in for an airstrike to destroy the facility on the island; in an effort to escape, they go up against the Meistermeuchlers (literal translation: Master Assassins), zombies that are engineered to adapt to their enemies' combat style and skills. After defeating the monstrous creatures, they manage to stow away on one of Straub's zeppelins, as he and his forces return to Berlin in response to Adolf Hitler's call for rescue.\n\nThe zeppelins arrive at Berlin as the Red Army begins their invasion into the city. Realizing that the Russians will be outmatched by the undead army, the crew grabs onto one of the zombie drop pods and lands onto the ground. After assisting the Red Army by drawing Straub's attention away from them, the four recover three Geistkraft-powered melee weapons hidden around the city by the Nazis. Using the weapons as keys, they uncover a hidden courtyard, where they find the final piece of Barbarossa's Sword, the Blade. With all parts of the Sword collected, the crew infiltrates Straub's zeppelin for a final showdown, where he ends up being overwhelmed and brutally killed by his own zombies. They battle against Straub's last creation, the Stadtjäger (literal translation: 'City Hunter'), then make it back to the city where they hold out against the endless zombie horde until Rideau arrives and extracts them.\n\nIn the wake of Straub's demise, the undead army is unleashed all across Europe. United States President Harry S. Truman authorizes Rideau, now General, to form the Bureau of Archaic Technologies, a special task force consisting of global elite Allied agents, in order to combat the new threat. Unable to reassemble the Sword of Barbarossa on their own, Marie and Drostan deduce that their only option is to find the legendary forge of Thule. Jefferson, now promoted to Major, leads the team to New Swabia, Antarctica, in search of the forge upon discovery of increased Nazi activity in the region. Rideau leads a team of new Bureau recruits to transport the pieces of the Sword by different routes to New Swabia. The B.A.T. operatives head to a port at Málaga, Spain, and board a ship across the Atlantic Ocean. Along the way, they encounter resistance from the undead army, but manage to prevail. At New Swabia, the crew find the forge, and upon successful deciphering of ancient Thulian runes, they finally reassemble the Sword after Rideau delivers the remaining pieces. Afterwards, the crew battles against the Guardian of the forge, and emerges victorious. The four manage to escape the forge as it collapses, but unbeknownst to them, Geistkraft energy begins to flow intensively beneath the area.\n\nOn their flight back from New Swabia, the crew's plane is shot by a bolt of Geistkraft lightning, and crash-lands near the site. They then find themselves within the Lost City of Thule, the source of the Geistkraft energy. The team uncovers ancient weapons once wielded by the Raven Lords, elite warriors who are meant to bring balance to a cycle of life and death, and uses them against the undead horde. B.A.T. agent Vivian Harris, who is sent by Rideau to recover Barbarossa's Sword from the crash, is driven insane by its power, and uses it to awaken the God King, a gigantic Thulian entity who claims to be the influence behind Straub as well as Barbarossa. The God King seemingly overpowers the four, but Klaus, who has been reborn as the Rook, arrives and charges them with Geistkraft, bestowing them the title of Raven Lords, allowing them to defeat the God King. Rideau then contacts the four, revealing his true status as a member of the Order of the Ravens, an ancient cult dedicated to serving the Raven Lords; he insists that they must now embrace their newfound titles and destiny, and lead the Order in the ongoing battle against the remaining undead forces.\n\n\"Call of Duty: World War II\" is the second game in the \"Call of Duty\" franchise developed by Sledgehammer Games, and the third to benefit under publisher Activision's three-year development cycle (the first being Sledgehammer's \"\") in order for a longer development time for each game. A new \"Call of Duty\" title set in World War II was alluded to in a 2014 \"\" launch interview with Michael Condrey, co-founder of Sledgehammer Games. In the interview by \"Metro\", the interviewer asked him what the possibilities of where the next \"Call of Duty\" could go in terms of setting. Condrey responded, \"Some of my favorite pieces of entertainment are set in World War II.\" \"Band of Brothers\", I'm a massive fan of \"Band of Brothers\".\" Condrey dived further into the subject, \"And that's a great hero's war, kind of the last that was recognized as a noble cause in a war. So yeah, I think a next generation game with the latest production values and robustness in a World War II setting like \"Band of Brothers\" would be amazing. Now, how would it play and how would the multiplayer work after the new movement set in \"Advanced Warfare\"? That's a tougher question than I've had to tackle yet…\".\n\nSledgehammer Games was hesitant to reveal all the authentic settings from World War II that developers have put into the game's storyline. Activision initially refused to deny claims that Nazi extermination camps would be featured in the game. Adam Rosenberg of Mashable wrote that video games set during World War II tended to be \"Holocaust deniers\" in the sense that they avoided broaching the subject for business reasons, but that this could be the very first \"Call of Duty\" World War II based game where the Holocaust would be depicted. Senior creative director Bret Robbins said in an interview \"Some very, very dark things happened during this conflict and it felt wrong for us to ignore that.\" He further stated \"We absolutely show atrocities. It's an unfortunate part of the history, but you can't tell an authentic, truthful story without going there. So we went there.\" Robbins argued that audiences can now handle games with more maturity and nuance, \"People are ready for it. They want it\", he said. When asked directly over Twitter as to whether or not the story campaign would allow gamers the opportunity to play as soldiers from the Axis powers such as Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, Sledgehammer Games confirmed that the campaign gameplay would be limited to Allied forces. More specifically, Sledgehammer co-founder Michael Condrey confirmed that the game will focus exclusively on the Allied powers.\n\nThe Windows version of the game was developed in a collaboration with Raven Software. In regards to it, Raven's CTO Dwight Luetscher stated that they were trying to focus on the Windows platform, as well as the community, by responding to their needs for it to excel. The Windows version features several notable changes, including removal of controller aim assist and addition of sensitivity slider for aim-down-sights mechanic.\n\nAll pre-orders excluding the PC version included access to the private beta, which was made available first on the PlayStation 4 from August 25–28, followed by a second week for both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from September 1–4. The PC beta was announced as an open beta, and ran from September 29 – October 2 on Steam. Players who participated in the beta received the Beta Combat Pack for the full game, which contains a special in-game helmet, emblem and calling card. The game is available in three editions: Base Edition, Digital Deluxe Edition and the Pro Edition. The Pro Edition was sold exclusively at GameStop, with pre-orders of the game at GameStop also included a limited edition hat.\n\nThe game was released worldwide on November 3, 2017, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\n\nUpon the game's release, online servers were down for most of the day, inhibiting players from playing online multiplayer, as well as some not being able to access the campaign and Nazi Zombies. Activision acknowledged the problem and announced they were working to resolve it.\n\n\"Call of Duty: WWII\" offers four downloadable content map packs, each containing three regular Multiplayer maps, one War map, and one Nazi Zombies map. Players who purchase the Season Pass, which grant access to all four map packs on release, also receive Carentan, a remake of the multiplayer map of the same name featured in \"Call of Duty\" and \"Call of Duty 2\".\n\nOn December 19, 2017, Activision released a preview trailer for the first downloadable content pack, The Resistance, containing 3 new multiplayer maps: Anthropoid, Valkyrie, Occupation (the latter of which is a remake of Resistance from \"\"); 1 new War map: Operation Intercept; and 1 new Nazi Zombies map: The Darkest Shore. The map pack was released January 30, 2018, first on PlayStation 4, and on March 1, 2018, for Xbox One and Steam.\n\nOn April 6, 2018, Activision announced the second downloadable content pack, The War Machine, containing 3 multiplayer maps: Egypt, Dunkirk, V2; 1 new War map: Operation Husky; and 1 new Nazi Zombies map: The Shadowed Throne. The map pack was released April 17, 2018, first on PlayStation 4, and on May 17, 2018, for Xbox One and Steam.\n\nOn June 19, 2018, Activision announced the third downloadable content pack, United Front, containing 3 multiplayer maps: Monte Cassino, Market Garden, Stalingrad; 1 new War map: Operation Supercharge; and 3 new Nazi Zombies maps: Into the Storm, Across the Depth, and Beneath the Ice, referred to collectively as The Tortured Path. The map pack was released June 26, 2018, first on PlayStation 4, and on July 26, 2018, for Xbox One and Steam.\n\nOn August 23, 2018, Activision announced the fourth and final downloadable content pack, Shadow War, containing 3 multiplayer maps: Airship, Chancellery, Excavation; 1 new War map: Operation Arcane; and 1 new Nazi Zombies map: The Frozen Dawn. The map pack will be released August 28, 2018, first on PlayStation 4, and on September 27, 2018, for Xbox One and Steam.\n\nIn addition to the map packs, the game also received several free multiplayer maps as part of seasonal events. On December 7, 2017, Sledgehammer released Winter Carentan, a winter-themed version of the Carentan map to all players as part of the Winter Siege event. On March 13, 2018, Shipment 1944, a remake of the map Shipment from \"\" was released to all season pass holders, and to all players three days after. On April 17, 2018, Sledgehammer Games introduced a new map, HQ, based on the same Headquarters social hub, as a playable map in several party modes. On May 29, 2018, the Nazi Zombies map Gröesten Haus is brought into Multiplayer as a playable map for zombie-themed game modes as part of the Attack of the Undead event. On July 30, 2018, a new map, Sandbox, is added for free to all PlayStation 4 players as part of the Days of Summer event, and on August 30, 2018 for Xbox One and Steam players.\n\n\"Call of Duty: WWII\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, while the PC version received \"mixed or average\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nMiguel Concepcion of \"GameSpot\" awarded the game a 9/10, writing that the campaign was \"moving\" and \"salutes the brotherhood that grows and strengthens on the battlefield\", while praising the game's \"excellent visuals and sound design\". Daniel Tack from \"Game Informer\" gave the game a 8.75/10, stating that he felt the campaign was the only drawback overall; despite capturing a \"signature explosive feel through various adrenaline-fueled moments\", he thought progression felt tedious as a result of \"standard gunplay and endless killing fields\". He praised the multiplayer as the \"shining star of the three modes\", especially enjoying the game's new War mode in terms of its variety, and highlighted the return to the traditional gameplay and range of customization options.\n\nIn his 8.5/10 review for \"EGMNow\", Nick Plasses wrote that the campaign's protagonists were \"well characterized and [...] the cause for the game's most impactful conflicts\". He praised the lack of regenerating health which gave the game \"new levels of strategy and exploration, ultimately adding more entertainment than frustration\", and that the reliance on fellow soldiers \"necessitates more strategic positioning and resource management\". \"IGN\"s Miranda Sanchez awarded the game 8/10, saying the campaign was a \"more human perspective than we've seen in recent years\", with interesting and diverse characters. However, she criticized its conflicting tone, as well as several repetitive and frustrating missions. She wrote that the Zombies was the standout mode in the game, which helped strike \"a rewarding balance for the diehard zombies fans [...] and those that just want to jump in and have a good time\", although criticized that the experience suffered when playing with other people.\n\n\"Destructoid\"s Chris Moyse praised the game as a \"satisfying experience\" and the campaign as \"one of the series' best in some time\", but felt that \"it also makes little effort to overhaul the brand as a whole, playing it incredibly safe when the opportunity for reinvention was right there for the taking.\" \"Polygon\"s Russ Frushtick generally praised the multiplayer, calling it \"strong and enjoyable\", but criticized the campaign, writing that \"just about every mission feels like déjà vu, as if I'd played it before in another game\" and that \"Changing the time period so dramatically only helps to highlight how little has changed since the franchise's total re-imagining with \"Call of Duty 4\".\" Jeff Gerstmann of \"Giant Bomb\" was more critical of the game as a whole, stating that \"despite all of Activision's big talk about \"boots on the ground\" action and how this was going to be some big deal, the setting change didn't bring any new and exciting inspiration with it. This feels like the most wheel-spinning, by-the-numbers \"Call of Duty\" they've made thus far.\"\n\n\"Eurogamer\" ranked the game 38th on their list of the \"Top 50 Games of 2017\", while \"EGMNow\" ranked it 20th in their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017. The game was nominated for \"Best Shooter\", \"Best Graphics\", \"Best Multiplayer\" and \"Best Spectator Game\" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards.\n\nThe game earned over $500 million within its first three days of release. On December 20, 2017, it was confirmed that the game had generated over $1 billion in revenue, making it the highest-grossing console game of the year in North America. As of January 1, 2018, \"Call of Duty: WWII\" reached 20.7 million players over all platforms, 12.1 million players on PlayStation 4, 7.8 million players on Xbox One, and 825,000 players on Steam.\n\nThe PlayStation 4 version sold 168,234 copies within its first week on sale in Japan, making it the best-selling game of the week.\n\nNot long after \"WWII\" was released, a fatal incident occurred in which an online player, Casey Viner, angered over friendly fire that ruined an online match in a tournament that cost $1.50 in betting, called up Tyler Barriss to swat his partner Shane Gaskill. Fearing harm, Gaskill attempted to deflect Viner's swatting by providing a previous address, only to later discover in horror that the police forces Barriss summoned ended up killing an uninvolved individual there, Andrew Finch. Viner, Gaskill and Barriss all face charges for the incident.\n"}

Aircraft from Canada and the United States, as well as other countries, perform over Lake Ontario for three days in September.\n\nToronto was the site of numerous air shows as the city developed into a centre of air transportation and aircraft manufacturing in the early twentieth century. The Canadian International Air Show began in 1946 when the National Aeronautical Association of Canada attracted overflow crowds to a show at de Havilland Canada manufacturing plant at Downsview Airport. Staged annually thereafter, the air show moved to Exhibition Place in 1949, and became a regular feature of the CNE in 1956.\n\nThe official CIAS takes place over the Canadian Labour Day Weekend, which coincides with the closing weekend of the CNE. The start time for the show is scheduled for 12:00 pm with the show ending at approximately 3:00 pm each afternoon. The CIAS practice session is usually held on the day before the official CIAS, taking place between 10:00 am and 2:00 pm\n\nThe show is performed over Lake Ontario directly south of Exhibition Place. It can be best viewed from Exhibition Place or Ontario Place, although the show is visible from any other lakefront site, especially Marilyn Bell Park or Coronation Park. Performers fly in from Pearson, as well as the island airport on nearby Toronto Islands. Admission to the air show is free; however, viewing from Exhibition Place requires paid admission to these sites.\n\nThere is no static display of aircraft. A photo tour at Pearson had been introduced in 1993 and a full static display in 1996. Although a success, the display was cancelled by the time of the 1998 air show.\n\nToronto media have noted that the airshow is not popular with local residents and that there is widespread opposition to it, due to the noise and pollution it creates. The Toronto Star noted, \"that in a city with a large population of refugee newcomers and people who have experienced the trauma of war it is insulting, invasive, and violent\".\n\nSince 2012, during the airshow weekend, the Wikipedia article about the show has been repeatedly vandalized as a form of protest against the airshow, a phenomenon noted by the local Toronto media.\n\nRegular performers include the Snowbirds, other Canadian Armed Forces aircraft, the United States Air Force (USAF), and the United States Navy (USN).\nPast performers have included the Royal Canadian Air Cadets, the Canadian Harvard Aircraft Association, Vintage Wings of Canada, as well as private aerobatics teams, and commercial airlines.\n\nNotable appearances include;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a non-profit organization. Circus Flora has become a touring show yet it performs annually in St. Louis, usually at the beginning of the month of June. It combines the venue of a one-ring circus with the performance trappings of theater. Performances include aerialists, equestrian artists, acrobats, and trained animals. Each performance is accompanied by a live band. Live musicians allow the mood to be tailored to the live events happening in the ring — down to every crash of the cymbal or beat of the snare drum.\n\nCircus Flora is styled after old Eastern-European circuses. For many years, Circus Flora has featured many and various members of the renowned Flying Wallendas family.\nThe \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" described the 2007 performance as, \"an entertaining mixture of thoroughly professional performances and 'Let's put on a show in the old barn.'\" Circus Flora's 2007 show was also reviewed by the student newspaper of the University of Missouri-St. Louis.\n\nCircus Flora was first performed as a commissioned work for the 1986 Spoleto Festival USA, an annual celebration of the performing and visual arts in Charleston, South Carolina. Based upon its favorable reception, it was then founded as a permanent organization by Ivor David Balding, Sheila and Sam Jewell and Alexandre Sacha Pavlata. Its intended mission is to both entertain and to educate.\n\nCircus Flora made St. Louis, Missouri its home in 1987 with assistance from Vince Schoemehl, the mayor of St. Louis at that time, and Richard Gaddes, then president of Grand Center, St. Louis's creative and cultural district. Since then, the Circus Arts Foundation of Missouri (CAFM) has been the parent non-profit organization under which Circus Flora operates.\n\nFlora, the Elephant, is the namesake of Circus Flora. The circus was named after Flora, the orphaned baby African elephant Balding had rescued two years earlier when ivory poachers in Africa killed her mother.\nFor 15 years, Flora the elephant was a star of the circus. In 2000, she retired from stage life, and is now a resident of the Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, Tennessee.\n\nCircus Flora has performed in the following cities:\nSt. Louis, Missouri; The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.; The Spoleto Festival USA; Houston, Texas; New York, New York; Scottsdale, Arizona; Cooperstown, New York; Norfolk, Virginia; Nantucket Island; and several other locations.\n\nCircus Flora has cultivated education in the Circus Arts since its inception. One significant collaboration of Circus Flora's is its working relationship with The St. Louis Arches, an acrobatic troupe sponsored by Circus Day Foundation.\n"}
{"id": "1856564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1856564", "title": "Comedy rock", "text": "Comedy rock\n\nComedy rock is rock music mixed with comedy, often satire and parody.\n\nEarly American examples include Stan Freberg, who lampooned artists such as Elvis Presley, Harry Belafonte and The Platters, and Sheb Wooley. The latter's \"Purple People Eater\" reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" pop chart in 1958 and stayed there 6 weeks.\n\nIn Britain during the 1950s and early 1960s comedians such as Charlie Drake and The Goons frequently appeared in the top ten with humorous rock 'n' roll records—the latter, along with Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear, were to influence the word-play of John Lennon's lyrics. Later British groups specialised in comedy: these included The Scaffold, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias. Later in Britain, in the 2000s, Mitch Benn released several studio albums that satirised current affairs using various musical genres, but mainly rock. His 2012 \"Breaking Strings\" album was critically acclaimed for its rock sensibility.\n\nAllmusic described Frank Zappa as the \"godfather\" of comedy rock. The pop rock and folk rock band The Turtles released a comedy rock album, \"The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands\", in 1968, though the band had previously incorporated humor into their songs. Two of its members, Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman later performed more explicitly comedic songs as Flo & Eddie with their own band and with Frank Zappa.\n\nSeveral modern comedy rock bands have experienced mainstream commercial success. Duos Tenacious D and Flight of the Conchords both released platinum-selling albums and starred in their own respective comedic television series. Dan Finnerty with his The Dan Band has made comedy rock appearances in the Todd Phillips films \"Old School\" and \"The Hangover\" spoofing \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" and \"Candy Shop\", as well as his live show, which parodies female cover songs and was filmed as a one-hour TV special directed by McG and executive produced by Steven Spielberg. Stephen Lynch from New York developed a following with several Opie and Anthony appearances which led to two specials on Comedy Central. He performed on Broadway with the production of Grease.\n\nWith over 12 million albums sold, song parodist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic remains the highest-selling comedy act in history, with his 2014 album \"Mandatory Fun\" having debuted at #1 on the \"Billboard\" 200, the first comedy album to do so since Allan Shermans \"My Son, the Nut\" in 1963. Rock has been the target of many spoofs and several spoof bands have gone on to have hit records, for example Spinal Tap in the U.S., and The Hee Bee Gee Bees and Bad News in the UK. The band Steel Panther has become a fixture on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip with their parody of 80s glam metal and their success has opened the doors for other spoof bands such as The Jimi Homeless Experience. Other spoof bands such as Dread Zeppelin, Beatallica and Those Darn Accordions rely on unusual or intentionally contrasting genre-mixing for comic effect. Comedy rock duo Ninja Sex Party, who have collaborated with Steel Panther on occasion, blend rock and synthpop and have produced songs that parody the dubstep and heavy metal genres. They have enjoyed success from their online popularity. Another band, Primus, is known for their wacky lyrics and comedic music videos.\n\nMany bands within the alternative rock and college rock spectrum are known for their incorporation of humorous and satirical songs, with bands such as They Might Be Giants, The Presidents of the United States of America, Bloodhound Gang, System of a Down, Ween and Camper Van Beethoven finding both mainstream and independent success in the United States, as well as successful foreign bands such as Parokya ni Edgar and Knorkator.\n\nPunk rock and pop punk has made its contribution to the comedy rock ranks, with such bands as The Aquabats, Blink-182, Bowling for Soup, Patent Pending, Dead Kennedys, The Dead Milkmen, The Meatmen and The Radioactive Chicken Heads. Heavy metal has also produced many humor-oriented and satirical bands, including Green Jellÿ, Lawnmower Deth, Massacration, M.O.D., Big Dumb Face, Psychostick, Crotchduster, Ludichrist and Scatterbrain, while other bands like Gwar and Rosemary's Billygoat utilize outrageous costumes and over-the-top stage shows. The virtual band Dethklok is death metal spoof featured in the Adult Swim animated TV Show \"Metalocalypse\" and their album entitled \"The Dethalbum\" debuted at No. 21 on the \"Billboard\" Top 200 list.\n\n"}

However, it is rendered in full 3D - players can rotate, pan and zoom at will. Dinosaurs, staff and visitors are fully animated. The game uses a typical point and click and menu interface.\n\nIn \"Dino Island\", there are 20 pure, historical dinosaur species, including \"Tyrannosaurus rex\", \"Troodon\", \"Giganotosaurus\", \"Parasaurolophus\", \"Iguanodon\", \"Ankylosaurus\", and \"Pachycephalosaurus\". The dinosaurs are classified in 6 families: large carnivorous, armored quadrupeds, light bipeds, etc.\n\nThe player can mix any two dinosaurs to create a new one. The resulting creature will be a genetic mix of its parents: it will inherit features from both of them, based on genetic dominance. Each dinosaur is made of many parts: legs, arms, head, etc. Each part of the resulting dinosaur will also be a mix between that of its parents. For instance, the mix of a \"Diplodocus\" and a \"Triceratops\" will have a head in between that of its parents. Mutations can also occur, either accidentally or, when the player masters the technology, voluntarily. Mutations include feathers, extra horns, weird scales, and the like.\n\nVisitors also come in several categories, which all have likes and dislikes. For instance, kids like cute dinosaurs but do not like big ones, hooligans like to see dinosaur fights from up close but do not like peaceful dinosaurs, pensioners like diverse dinosaurs but not too much action, etc.\n\nEvery item in the game, dinosaurs, attraction or park installation, radiates several attributes like comfort, fear or cuteness, which will attract or repel different visitor types. Visitors will move in the park according to their needs. For instance, if the player's park has many other older visitors, it is not a good idea to put a path to the feeding dish and the shops next to the most violent dinosaurs, as they will hesitate to go that way.\n\nThe game also has a light park management aspect. The player can build facilities that sell stuff, enclosures to put the dinosaurs in and has to manage staff that will feed the dinosaurs, among other things. As this was not the focus of the game, there are very few options in that department, compared to other games in that category.\n\n"}

Since 2014 ERC is organized each year in Poland at the initiative of the Polish branch of The Mars Society.\n\nThe main core of ERC is international Mars rovers competition, destinated for students and recent graduates of higher education from all around the world. European Rover Challenge as well as University Rover Challenge (the American equivalent of this competition) is a part of Rover Challenge Series – the most prestigious robotics challenge league, powered by The Mars Society.\n\nThe aim of the European Rover Challenge is to encourage students of technical universities to develop their potential through participation in the prestigious competition. The ERC also performs a kind of mission: the promotion of talented engineers. Taking up the challenge of building the rover destined for Mars exploration which meets certain conditions specified in the rules of the competition and presenting the model in front of jury of experts in robotics, planetary geology, communication and cosmonautics is for young scientists a unique opportunity to develop their career.\n\nAccording to the ERC rules there are a few tasks to complete by rover teams during the competition:\n\nDuring all of the tasks, the teams will have to control their rovers without seeing them directly.\n\nEuropean Rover Challenge is an event aimed not only for the Mars rovers builders participating in the competition. Adding to the program some extra points, such as the science – technology conference, science presentations, expert’s lectures and meetings with special guests resulted in the interest of a very large and diverse target group. In 2014 in ERC took part 25 000 people, in the next edition - ERC 2015 - 30 000.\n\nEuropean Rover Challenge is organized since 2014. Both organized editions (2014 and 2015) of the event have been held in Świętokrzyskie voivodeship, in the Regional Science–Technology Centre. In order to properly adapt the landscape to the character of the competition, each time to the place were transported over 750 tons of the red soil imitating the Red Planet cover. Since 2016 ERC is held in Congress and Exhibition Center in Podkarpackie voivodeship, Poland\n\nEach year in the event take part special guests. In previous editions of ERC they were among others: dr Harrison Schmitt – Apollo 17 crew, prof. Scott Hubbard, ex. Head of NASA Ames, dr Robert Zubrin, The Mars Society Founder and dr Gianfranco Visentin, Head of Automation and Robotics Section, European Space Agency. During ERC 2015 has been organized also a unique videomeeting with Andy Weir, an American novelist, author of The Martian.\n\n5–7 September 2014 - first edition - ERC 2014\nNumber of competing teams: 9 (e.g. from India, Colombia, Egypt, Poland)\n\n4–6 September 2015 - the second edition - ERC 2015\nNumber of competing teams: 29 (e.g. from US, Australia, India, Colombia, Netherlands, Egypt, Poland and Canada)\n\n"}

{"id": "2890683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2890683", "title": "Fake Shemp", "text": "Fake Shemp\n\nFake Shemp, or simply Shemp, is someone who appears in a film as a replacement for another actor or person. Their appearance is disguised using methods such as heavy make-up (or a computer-generated equivalent), filming from the back, dubbing in audio and splicing in past footage from the original actor's previous work, using a sound-alike voice actor, or using partial shots of the actor. The concept is named after Shemp Howard, whose sudden death in 1955 necessitated the use of these techniques to finish the films to which he was already committed. Once somewhat commonplace throughout the 20th century, the use of Fake Shemps to emulate living people is now forbidden under Screen Actors Guild contracts, largely because of a lawsuit filed by Crispin Glover that determined that the method violates the original actor's personality rights. The method continues to be used in cases, such as Shemp's, where the original actor is deceased and permission from the deceased actor's estate is granted.\n\nA fake Shemp is distinguished from a stunt double. Stunt doubles usually only substitute for an actor in select scenes where the original actor is either unable to perform the stunt or is unwilling to take the risk of being injured in the stunt. The same techniques are often used for both.\n\nThe term references the comedy trio The Three Stooges. On November 22, 1955, Stooge Shemp Howard died suddenly of a heart attack at age 60. At the time, the Stooges still had four shorts left to deliver (\"Rumpus in the Harem\", \"Hot Stuff\", \"Scheming Schemers\", and \"Commotion on the Ocean\"), by the terms of their annual contract with Columbia Pictures. By this point in the trio's career, budget cuts at Columbia had forced them to make heavy use of stock footage from previously completed shorts, so they were able to complete the films without Shemp. New footage was filmed of the other two Stooges (Moe Howard and Larry Fine) and edited together with stock footage. When continuity required that Shemp appear in the new scenes, they used Columbia supporting player Joe Palma to be a body double for him, often appearing only from behind or with an object obscuring his face. \n\nPalma is often mistakenly cited as Shemp's stand-in, but these four shorts are the only documented times he performed in this capacity. Palma was a bit character actor and was not employed as a stand-in or double during Shemp's lifetime. Shemp's stand-in was usually Harold Breen, and there were others from time to time. But these four shorts required someone to double as Shemp in an actor's capacity, not a stand-in as such; hence, director Jules White utilized character actor Palma, who had appeared as a supporting character in numerous \"Three Stooges\" shorts before Shemp's death and would continue in that capacity for the trio's shorts with Joe Besser as the third stooge. Palma became the original \"Fake Shemp\", although the term was not officially in use at the time.\n\nFor \"Rumpus in the Harem\", Palma is seen from the back several times. The first time occurs in the restaurant when Moe declares that the trio must do something to help their sweethearts. Larry then concludes the conversation by saying \"I've got it, I've got it!\" Moe inquires with \"What?\" Larry replies, \"a terrific headache!\" Later, Palma is seen from the back being chased in circles by the palace guard. A few lines of dialogue appear — \"Whoa, Moe, Larry! Moe, help!\" — by dubbing Shemp's voice from the soundtracks of \"Fuelin' Around \"and \"Blunder Boys\". Palma was later seen from the side when staring up at the Harem girls (they allowed half his face to be shown because he was farther from the camera than Moe or Larry).\n\nPalma is seen one final time, making a mad dash for the open window, and supplying his own yell before making the final jump. This was one of the few times during his tenure as Shemp's double that Palma was required to speak without the aid of dubbing.\n\nFor \"Hot Stuff\", Palma is seen several times. The first time occurs when the Stooges, disguised in beards, are trolling through office hallways. Moe instructs Shemp to pursue a suspicious looking girl, to which Palma grunts \"Right!\" He then walks off-camera, allowing Moe and Larry to finish the scene by themselves. This is the only time Palma was shown from the front in a near shot, but since his secret agent character was wearing a fake beard at the time, his face was concealed.\n\nLater, Palma is seen from the back while the boys are locked in the laboratory. Palma attempts to imitate Shemp's famed cry of \"Heep, heep, heep!\". Again, Moe directs Shemp, this time to guard the door. Palma obliges, mutters a few additional \"Heep, heep, heeps!,\" and hides behind the door. This brief scene was the largest speaking part Palma performed in his own voice while acting as Shemp.\n\nFor \"Scheming Schemers\", Palma appears for the shot of \"Shemp\" honking a truck horn. Palma gathers several pipes, obstructing his face, and one line of dialogue (\"Hold yer horses, will ya?\") is dubbed in Shemp's voice from \"The Ghost Talks\". Shemp is absent from several scenes. In one scene, Larry, upon hearing that a valuable piece of art has been stolen, whispers to Moe, \"Where's Shemp? He loves pictures!\" Moe mutters, \"I think he's upstairs,\" explaining away Shemp's absence for the next few minutes.\n\nFor \"Commotion on the Ocean\", Palma appears in only one new shot during the newspaper office scene. After Larry says, \"Oh, I know Smitty: 'Under the spreading chestnut tree, the village smitty stands',\" Moe slaps him. Palma gets involved in the slapstick exchange and shields himself in defense, obstructing his face. \n\nOther new footage throughout the film consists of Moe and Larry working as a duo, often discussing Shemp's absence aloud:\n\n\nAspiring filmmaker Sam Raimi, a professed Stooges fan, coined the term in his first feature-length movie \"The Evil Dead\". Most of his crew and cast abandoned the project after major delays (mostly due to budget issues) pushed production well beyond the scheduled six weeks. He was forced to use himself, his die-hard friends Bruce Campbell, Rob Tapert, Josh Becker, assistant David Goodman, and brother Ted Raimi as \"fake Shemps\".\n\nSam Raimi's later productions in film and TV have also often used the term to refer to stand-ins or nameless characters. For example, 15 fake Shemps were included in the credits for \"Army of Darkness\", Raimi's second sequel to \"The Evil Dead\". The description is sometimes modified in the final credits; in \"Darkman\", Bruce Campbell's quick cameo in the final scene is credited as \"Final Shemp\", and Campbell was also credited as \"Shemp Wooley\" (a pun on singer Sheb Wooley) when doing the voice of \"Jean-Claude the Carrier Parrot\" in the short-lived TV series \"Jack of All Trades\".\n\nThere have been many Fake Shemps over the years. One of the earliest, in an example that predates its use to replace Shemp, was in the film \"Saratoga\", in which the illness and death of star Jean Harlow necessitated the filming of scenes with a voice and body double. Director Ed Wood used his wife's chiropractor, Tom Mason, in the 1959 cult classic \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" as a stand-in for the deceased Bela Lugosi. \n\nIn the 1981 film \"Superman II\", actor Gene Hackman, who had finished the majority of his scenes playing Lex Luthor, left the project following the departure of the film's original director, Richard Donner. After replacement director Richard Lester took over production, a Shemp was used for Hackman to finish his remaining scenes. This was accomplished by an uncredited actor standing in for Hackman, though not ever facing the camera, while also impersonating Hackman's voice.\n\nThe death of actor John Candy forced the use of a fake Shemp to complete filming of \"Wagons East!\".\n\nAnother example is from the 1989 film \"Back to the Future Part II\". Actor Crispin Glover was asked to reprise the role of George McFly. Glover indicated interest, but could not come to an agreement with the producers regarding his salary. For the George McFly character to appear, director Robert Zemeckis used some previously filmed footage of Glover from the first film and inter-spliced Jeffrey Weissman, who wore prosthetics including a false chin, nose, and cheekbones and used various obfuscating methods, such as background, sunglasses, rear shot, and even upside-down, to resemble Glover. Dissatisfied with these plans, Glover filed a lawsuit against the producers, including Steven Spielberg, on the grounds that they neither owned his likeness nor had permission to use it. Due to Glover's lawsuit, there are now clauses in the Screen Actors Guild collective bargaining agreements that state that producers and actors are not allowed to use such methods to reproduce the likeness of other actors.\n\n\nSee also \"Dark Horse Comic\", AOD #2 of 3, interview with Bruce Campbell\n"}

It had since established itself contemporarily as a popular art form in Taiwan.\n\nThe puppet's head uses wood carved into the shape of a hollow human head, but aside from the head, palms, and feet, which are made of wood, the puppet's torso and limbs consist entirely of cloth costumes. At the time of the performance, a gloved hand enters the puppet's costume and makes it perform. In previous years the puppets used in this type of performance strongly resembled \"cloth sacks,\" hence the name, which literally means \"cloth bag opera.\"\n\nGlove puppetry (pò͘-tē-hì) performances, similar to some types of Chinese opera, are divided into a first half and a second half show. During the first half, known as the \"show platform\" (戲台), the audience is shown a demonstration by a master puppeteer on the stage. The second half consists of the puppet master, the orchestra, and the spoken parts. Several key points of a show to be appreciated include: the dexterity of the master puppeteer's manipulation of the puppet, the accompaniment of the orchestra, and the poetic spoken parts of the voice actors. With few exceptions, from traditional pò͘-tē-hì to modern performances, human vocal music and operatic singing is rarely heard.\n\nIn Indonesia, glove puppetry once popular throughout Chinese communities around Sumatra and Java. Especially in Java, the acculturation between Chinese and Javanese culture gave birth to new style of puppetry, called \"Peranakan Potehi\". Today, glove puppetry is called with the term \"Wayang Potehi\" (Wayang means \"puppet\" in Javanese). The Wayang Potehi tradition is mainly preserved in Central Java (Semarang) and East Java's () Chinese communities. Most of the dialog parts of Wayang Potehi have been narrated using Indonesian and Javanese language.\n\n\n"}

The dance is very similar to earlier European folk dance and is thought to be a sub form of zapateo with less airborne moves (unlike jumpstyle, for example, which features the \"drunken sailor\" style of jazz dance and high kicks). Music one is able to do the dance to is also called \"hakmuziek\". The name is derived from the Dutch verb \"hakken\" which generally means chopping, or hacking.\n\nIn Australia, the dance is mainly referred to as gabber (noun) or gabbering (verb), named after the gabber subgenre of hardcore it is performed to. Despite the fact that it is called gabber, it is usually performed to music of the hardstyle genre by most people in Australia.\n\nThe dance consists of small steps that quickly follow to each other to the rhythm of the bass drum. The lower body (down from the pelvis) is the most important part, though it is not unusual to move the arms and torso too. Because one is supposed to keep up to the beat of the song, the dance is usually done fairly quickly, since the BPM of this music style can easily reach 190 BPM.\n"}

The troupe consisted of the six Hanlon brothers and their mentor, established acrobat Professor John Lees.\n\nOriginally billed as \"The Hanlons,\" the group debuted in 1846 at London's Theatre Royal, Adelphi. At this time, the company consisted of George, William, and Alfred Hanlon, who were essentially wards of John Lees until his death in 1855. After his demise, the Hanlons returned to England and enlisted their younger brothers – Thomas, Edward, and Frederick – and rechristened themselves \"The Hanlon-Lees\" in honor of their fallen friend and instructor.\n\nThe newly expanded troupe made its American debut in 1858 at Niblo's Garden in New York City, and spent the next four decades touring the United States and Europe. As their skills improved, their performances became more elaborate. When Jules Léotard introduced the trapeze in 1859, for instance, the Hanlon-Lees quickly adapted to the new device; their next production, \"Le Voyage en Suisse\" (\"A Trip to Switzerland\") contained an aerial juggling sequence that stunned Émile Zola, who expressed utter astonishment at the vast number of airborne objects. There is a spectacular poster by Jules Chéret, the great pioneer of the classic era of French poster design, advertising their appearance at the Folies Bergères in 1878. In addition, the company is referred to in J.K. Huysmans chapter: \"The Folies-Bergere in 1879\" in his book Parisian Sketches, first published in France in 1880: \"these side-splitting, yet funereal, clowns, the Hanlon-Lees.\".\n\nThe Hanlon-Lees also patented several inventions, including the aerial safety net and a wooden brace used in the construction of scenery (which is to this day referred to as a \"hanlon\").\n\nDespite the death of Thomas in 1868, the group continued to perform regularly until the early 1900s, at which point George Hanlon's sons Will and Fred assumed control of the company's repertoire. They would carry the company successfully into the 20th Century, going so far as to appear on film for Thomas Edison in a production entitled \"Fantasma\". The Hanlons would endure for another four decades, adapting their acts for vaudeville and finally appearing in the 1945 season of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\n\nIn 1979, six American performers sought out the final living descendant of the original Hanlon brothers and asked for her blessing upon their new company, dubbed the Hanlon-Lees Action Theater. This modern incarnation of the original troupe is best known for pioneering and refining a theatrical form of medieval jousting, an event which the company continues to perform at Renaissance festivals in the United States. The modern day Hanlon-Lees also perform Western-themed shows such as fantasy rodeos and cowboy exhibitions.\n\n"}

Proponents claim that repeated practice of this particular formula of mental imagery translates to improved coordination in dance and in movement in general \"based on the idea that imagery can improve skeletal alignment and posture through the re-patterning of neuromuscular pathways in the absence of overt movement\". Although there is some evidence that rehearsal-style mental imagery may benefit performance in sports, there is currently insufficient data to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of metaphorical imagery as only personal and experimental research has been conducted on ideokinesis and there are reasons to believe it may be contraindicated as a relaxation technique.\n\nIdeokinesis was originally developed as a form of mental practice for injured dancers, but some dance schools have integrated it into a standard somatics protocol for all dancers because it is thought to optimize motor control and performance by using periods of rest constructively. Known among followers as \"the Work\", \"ideokinesis\" is sometimes used interchangeably with other terms, such as \"mental practice\", \"mental rehearsal\", \"visuomotor behavior rehearsal\", \"covert rehearsal\", and \"ideokinetic facilitation\", among others.\n\nMabel Todd conceived the ideokinesis approach; Barbara Clark and Lulu Sweigard, and others contributed to its early evolution; later, André Bernard, Irene Dowd, Erick Hawkins, Pamela Matt, Eric Franklin and others lent their influence.\n\nSweigard borrowed the word \"ideokinesis\", composed by two Greek words: ideo (thought) and kinesis (movement), from Bonpensière, a piano teacher, who applied imagery to his methodology. Ideokinesis can be translated roughly as \"the image or thought as facilitator of movement\".\n"}

When his father died six years later his mother emigrated to America leaving the children with grandparents. In 1920 the family was reunited in the United States and Julius began to work in theater. He played with Julius Natanson, Leon Blank, Boris Thomashevsky, Aaron Lebedeff, Samuel Goldenberg, Jennie Goldstein, and others. He originally trained as a hat maker; when his stepfather learned of his desire to become an actor, Adler was put out of the family home. He got as far as the fire escape where he slept and where his mother gave him food. When Adler's stepfather learned about the amount of money his stepson was making in his acting career, he was invited to move back into the family apartment.\n\nIn 1935, he met Henrietta Jacobson while both were appearing with Herman Yablokoff (Hayim Yablonik) in McKinley Square Theater. She was a divorcee with a young son from a prior marriage. Henrietta had deep roots in the Jewish theater community. Her parents, Joseph and Bessie, were Yiddish theater stars at the beginning of the 20th century, and her brothers, Hymie and Irving, not only performed but owned several prominent Yiddish theaters in New York City. When her father died, Henrietta was just seven weeks old; Bessie continued to perform and brought her four children up as performers also. Julius and Henrietta formed a team and performed together for three years. When they had an offer to perform in Belgium, Julius proposed by remarking that they could save money on visas and other expenses as a married couple. Henrietta accepted and they were married in 1938.\n\nAdler was accepted into the Hebrew Actors Union in 1938 and with his wife toured France, Lithuania, and Belgium. They then played in Chicago, then at the Hopkonson Theater and made a revue film. They played with Molly Picon and Jacob Kalich at the Second Avenue Theater in the Yiddish Theater District; in 1948 they played in London. In 1950 he became director of the National Theater and produced Yiddish vaudeville. The couple also wrote plays. Their son, Bruce Adler (Borekh Yosl, born 1944) played Yiddish theater when he was young. He also later worked on Broadway and was nominated for two Tony Awards. The Adler family played the London Palladium with Sophie Tucker in the 1950s.\n\nAdler also did some work in films, beginning in 1926 with \"Broken Hearts\". He had an uncredited role as the High Priest in the 1935 film, \"She\". Adler was cast as Aleksei (the priest) for the film \"Tevya\" (1939). The musical \"Fiddler on the Roof\" was based on this film, though this early version of the story was non-musical. His last film role was as a comedian in the 1950 \"Catskill Honeymoon\",\n\nAdler and his wife were performing in non-Yiddish theater by the 1960s. In 1973, they were the stars of a St. Petersburg, Florida production of \"Come Blow Your Horn\". Their son, Bruce, was also cast in the play as the younger brother.\n\nThe couple is buried in the Yiddish Theatrical Alliance section (Block 67) of Mount Hebron Cemetery. The section is reserved for those who were part of New York's Yiddish theater and is maintained by the Alliance.\n"}

Some news websites reported that Turney was the first user banned for violating the updated rules of conduct. Turney clarified on Twitter, stating, \"Dear everyone writing articles saying I was banned from Twitch, I wasn't. I've never been banned. I was told to change my picture,\" adding \"while we're on the subject I've never done any 'sexy broadcasts'. I've never even streamed from that account.\" Additionally, Turney also provided her opinion that the rule was not unfair to women, but just unfair in general, stating, \"If someone has a big push-up bra and a low-cut shirt while they play [\"League of Legends\"] or a guy streams shirtless, who cares?\"\n\nIn June 2017, Turney began streaming on Twitch.\n\nThrough a friend's invitation to Ushicon 1, Turney was introduced to cosplaying and anime conventions in 2002. Turney's first cosplay was of Sailor Heavy Metal Papillon from the anime, \"Sailor Moon\". On her first cosplay, Turney recalled, \"I failed terribly. I couldn’t make half the costume, it was incredibly difficult, but I was as happy as a clam.\" Since then, Turney has become recognized for her cosplaying, in addition to her online media career; \"Gamer Headlines\" described Turney as being, \"known for her high quality cosplay and saucy lingerie photos.\" Turney's Princess Leia, Faye Valentine, and Psycho cosplays have been particularly noted by various online publications.

In a video interview with the YouTube channel \"VlogBrothers\", she further discussed being bisexual, and spoke about how she was teased for her sexual orientation. She has been in a relationship with Gavin Free since 2013.\n\nOn January 26, 2018, a fan armed with a handgun broke into Turney's and Free's home, breaking a window to enter and firing one round as he did. Turney and Free hid in a closet and called police. When the man could not find the couple, he left but was confronted by police outside. The suspect fired one shot and police returned fire; when officers approached the suspect's vehicle, they found him dead. Whether the suspect's death was from self-inflicted shots or shots fired by police is under investigation. Turney and Free were unharmed during the incident. It has been assessed the suspect had developed an obsession with Turney, and he was attempting to cause harm to Free, against whom he felt resentment. Turney ceased updating her YouTube channel for nearly half a year following the incident, citing concern for her safety in sharing her life with an audience.\n\n\n"}

It is a Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS) or DVB-C wireless microwave-based broadcast subscription television provider. They offer a variety of packages which can be considered as comparatively priced to similar providers throughout the world. \n\nThe service began operating on December 14, 1987, under the name Subscription Television (STV), which had very few channels offered. The main channels were CNN, ESPN, and Lifetime Television, with an occasional option of pay per view (PPV) being offered for local special events and the occasional international PPV sports broadcast. In 1996 it was upgraded to include a new platform called Multi-Choice TV which was an analog wireless microwave broadcast offering many more channels (e.g., BBC, Canada's CBC, TBN) eventually maxing the bandwidth capacity and having to upgrade the service to a digital broadcast system. Multi-Choice TV have not fully converted all of its subscribers yet. The system relies on line-of-sight propagation so total island wide coverage have proved to be a problem and the provider is looking into alternatives. A recent press release have indicated their interest in a partnership with the local telco LIME. From 1 September 2008 MCTV replaced the Travel Channel on 511 (part of the High Flyer package) by Setanta Sports.\n\nThe service uses a Yagi antenna to receive the encrypted broadcast, which in turn is then decrypted by the provider's set top box. The provider now has the problem of signal theft by pirates using modified DVB-C compatible receivers and PCI cards with the most popular being the \"Dreambox\" manufactured in Germany to decode their signal which is based on Nagravision which is a conditional access control system developed by the Kudelski Group. In order to prevent such activity in August, 2006 the Government of Barbados stiffened the local Barbadian copyright laws, in addition to a strengthening of the laws on cable TV piracy. The CBC provider is planning for further circumvention of the Dream boxes in 2009. \n\nIn 2014 MCTV have gone through a massive upgrade of improving their services by including new channels such as MovieCity Action and Hollywood, AMC, KTLA, WGN, Disney, NBC Sports network, etc. Also MCTV have upgraded their systems to 20 HD channels such as ABC, NBC, CBS & FOX and have also added new PVR boxes. MCTV new slogan is MCTV the Right Choice and are increasing their channel line ups and packaging for their loyal customers in Barbados. MCTV is still the number 1 provider in Barbados but they have competition from Lime Barbados and Flow, but the advantage MCTV has is, it does not depend on the internet to provide single for their customers and when there is rainy and cloudy condition MCTV still provides good service.\n\nMulti-Choice TV also competes against the US-based direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service provider DirecTV in Barbados. The service uses the NTSC television format.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55057222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55057222", "title": "Odiyan", "text": "Odiyan\n\nOdiyan is an upcoming Indian Malayalam-language fantasy thriller film directed by V. A. Shrikumar Menon in his feature film debut. It was written by Harikrishnan and is based on the legend of the Odiyan clan, who in Kerala folklore are men possessing shapeshifting abilities, who could assume animal form. Odiyans are said to have inhabited the Malabar region of Kerala during the era before electricity. The film stars Mohanlal in the title role, alongside Prakash Raj and Manju Warrier. The film was produced by Antony Perumbavoor through Aashirvad Cinemas.\n\nPrincipal photography began in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh in August 2017. Major parts of the film were shot in Palakkad district, where the Thenkurissi village in the film was recreated. Some scenes were also filmed in Vagamon, Athirappilly, and Kochi. The film was completed after 145 days of shooting. Sam C. S. composed the film's score and it also features songs composed by M. Jayachandran. \"Odiyan\" is set to release worldwide on 14 December 2018.\n\n\nOn 4 February 2017, \"Kerala Kaumudi\" reported that a 3D film titled \"Odiyan\" was in development, starring Mohanlal and Amitabh Bachchan, written by Harikrishnan and to be directed by commercial director V. A. Shrikumar Menon in what will be his feature film debut. Bachchan was reported to be playing the father role of Mohanlal's character, with Prakash Raj and Manju Warrier in substantial roles. It said the film is based on the legends of the \"Odiyan\" clan—mythical black magicians with the ability to shapeshift by using a trick called \"odi vidya\". Inhabiting mostly the Malabar regions (North Kerala), the legend is that Odiyans used to terrorise people to death by appearing in animal forms at night, called \"odi veykkuka\". In Harikrishnan's account, this account was fact: this was their vocation, but in modern times the Odiyans were wiped out from history and faded into oblivion. This story was completely based on the tales of Odiyan and he did not make any additional research.\n\nOn 26 March 2017, the project was officially confirmed by Mohanlal via social media. He wrote that Antony Perumbavoor would produce the film through Aashirvad Cinemas and Sabu Cyril (replaced by Prashanth Madhav) and Shaji Kumar would serve as production designer and cinematographer, while Warrier would play the female lead role—though he did not mention Bachchan, Raj or the 3D format. Menon said \"Odiyan\" is a \"rustic thriller\" and the story is rooted on the tribes of Odiyans and their myth. Odiyans can be described as the first \"quotation gangs\" (hired criminals) in Kerala, who went in disguise of animals during night hours to attack enemies. The film is a magical realism thriller. Both Menon and Harikrishnan hail from Palakkad (Malabar) and grown up hearing the legends of Odiyans during their childhood. It was Harikrishsnan's long-time dream to write a story on Odiyans. The film is also set in rural Palakkad.\n\nMenon and Harikrishnan initially planned a children's film titled \"Randu Vaanavillukal\". The film was set in the backdrop of the drylands of Tamil Nadu. Before filming, however, the Tamil Nadu flood happened, turning the filming land green and lush after the flood. The terrain was unsuitable for the film and their plans to shift the location also went futile. The two met again for a follow-up discussion. \"Odiyan\" originated from the conversation between Menon and Harikrishnan. Menon liked a one-line story of it narrated by Harikrishnan. Afterwards, Harikrishnan wrote a single scene of \"Odiyan\", intended as the introduction of the title character. He showed it to Menon, who in turn sent it to Mohanlal and the project took off. The scene remains in the film's final cut too. Earlier, writer-director A. K. Lohithadas had also proceeded with a story based on an Odiyan with Mohanlal himself in the lead role, but it was not made into a film. Later, director Lal Jose also contemplated on making such a film, but later dropped the idea. Evaluating these unsuccessful attempts, Harikrishnan said that it could be because they might have directly followed the myth behind Odiyans, rather than making a novel adaptation. Harikrishnan wrote \"Odiyan\" devoid of myth. Antony Perumbavoor suggested a major change in the first draft of screenplay which introduced a villain in the film. The script was completely rehashed based on that, after which Menon described Antony as an ace script doctor. Mohanlal suggested two minor changes in the second draft and approved the screenplay in the second sitting.\n\nHarikrishnan received the hinge of the story back when he was lecturing journalism classes when he asked the students to write a feature story to test their creativity. The subject was: \"if Hollywood director Steven Spielberg comes to Palakkad to meet the last Odiyan\". The word \"last\" was registered in his mind and became the plot point in his screenplay. His story is about the last surviving Odiyan and why the clan became extinct after him. The story spans 50 years through three generations of the last Odiyan lineage and is set in the Thenkurissi village in Palakkad, where Odiyans were most popular. It is a concoction of folktales prevalent in the Malabar region, chiefly in Palakkad. The screenplay was registered in the Writers Guild of America. Producer Antony Perumbavoor gave them freedom to conceive the film as big as possible, giving the film an open budget.\n\nThe initial plan was to shoot the film in 3D but the plan was later dropped. In March 2017, it was reported that A. Sreekar Prasad would be the film's editor (he was later replaced by Johnkutty), M. Jayachandran as music director, P. M. Satheesh as sound designer, Peter Hein as stunt coordinator and Gokuldas (replaced by Prashanth Madhav) as art director. Menon said \"Odiyan\" is likely to release in 2017 itself, but is uncertain as the film requires an extensive post-production with a large chunk of time need to be spend for visual effects. Filming was then scheduled to begin on 25 May 2017. In June 2017, the film crew convened for a script discussion session at an outdoor location in Kava, Palakkad. The film was then scheduled to begin on 1 August.\n\nThe official puja function of the film was held at hotel Vivanta by Taj in Thiruvananthapuram on 5 July 2017. The venue was shared by Aashirvad Cinemas' \"Aadhi\" puja as well. In July, Menon said filming would begin by mid-August, \"we will be shooting in locations such as Thasarak, Kollengode, Alathur, Nemmara, and Pollachi, where it is believed that Odiyans lived\", additionally it will also have Varanasi as a location. He said many special effects would be utilised in the film and the post-production would last close to six months. It was also revealed the plan is to simultaneously release the film in Tamil and Telugu languages along with the original Malayalam version.\n\nIn August, Prashanth Madhav began the film's set work in Palakkad by creating the Thenkurissi village which pass through three eras in the story. The crew went for location recce in Palakkad and Varanasi in the month. Menon said that Odiyan Manikyan's journey starts from the holy Ghats in Varanasi, where he spend 15 years before returning to Thenkurissi. For the climax fight sequence set inside an Indian banyan tree, the team traveled across India to find a suitable tree, in places such as Cumbum, Theni, Mysore and almost finalised a tree called Dodda Alada Mara in Bangalore Urban. However, he was unable to obtain permission for night shooting there. The team finally able to find a tree in Kerala itself, in Palakkad.\n\nBoth Harikrishnan and Menon wanted Mohanlal in the lead role from the film's initial discussion itself and the screenplay was later tailor-made with Mohanlal in mind. His character Odiyan Manikyan has two stages, one at present and the other 30 years ago. Describing him, Menon said: \"Manikyan is considered the greatest Odiyan that ever lived. He has mastered the skills that have been passed down by his forefathers of the clan\". Soon after the film's confirmation by Mohanlal in March 2017, Menon revealed to media outlets that Raj would be portraying the antagonist and Warrier will have an equally important role as that of Mohanlal, while a leading Bollywood actor would also play a pivotal role. Raj plays the character of Ravunni. The characters of Mohanlal, Warrier and Raj pass through three stages of their life. Warrier portrays the character of Prabha. In the film, Prabha is shown in her late 20s, at 35 and in her 50s and so will have three looks.\n\nIn April, Menon confirmed Siddique and Nandhu in the cast. In the same month, it was reported Appani Sarath would be part of the cast. Negotiations were going on with Hindi actor Amitabh Bachchan for a role. However, close to filming it was reported Tamil actor Sathyaraj had replaced Bachchan. It was for the role of Manikyan's grandfather, for which Hindi actor Manoj Joshi was ultimately cast. Writer Harikrishnan said, Bachchan had indeed agreed to work in the film, but was unable to join due to personal reasons. Since the film would have been delayed if they waited for Bachchan, they move on to other actors. In June, a casting call was released seeking children and teenagers for playing the younger versions of Mohanlal, Warrier and Raj. It also invited youngsters for other undisclosed roles.\n\nIn September, Aneesh G. Menon confirmed he is part of the cast. In November, Narain confirmed he is part of the cast and would join the film in its final schedule, which will shoot Odiyan Manikyan's younger age. He plays the husband of Prabha and his scenes are with Mohanlal, Raj and Warrier. From the teaser trailer released in December, more of the cast was revealed confirming Kailash, Sana Althaf, and Sreejaya Nair. Sana plays Warrier's sister and Kailash's wife in the film. She said it was a difficult role to portray. The character has less screen time but is important in the script. Her character has transition from a young girl to an aged woman. Including Sana, many of the artists were prepared through a week long acting workshop. Atul Mongia served as the acting workshop director.\n\nPrincipal photography began on 25 August 2017 in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. Mohanlal joined the film three days later. Some scenes were shot at the Assi Ghat with Mohanlal. Underwater action scenes were filmed in the Ganges River. In Varanasi, the film was extensively shot at the Havelis, the lanes, and the Ghats. Sreejaya Nair was also part of this schedule. In the film, Odiyan Manikyan spent 15 years in the sacred lands of Varanasi before returning to his native village, Thenkurissi. This period of his life, his older age, was filmed there. After completing, the crew left Varanasi by the end of the month and remaining was the scenes in Thenkurissi. Since the film wanted a period setting, the modern-day Thenkurissi was unsuitable for filming. Hence, the village was recreated in a 20 acre land in Mucheeri, Palakkad district. The second schedule in Palakkad was scheduled to begin on 6 September. Raj joined the film with Mohanlal and Warrier in the banks of Bharathappuzha on 9 September. A champion goat named Madurai Machadaiyan was used in the film.\n\nThe film's climax portions was filmed from 6 October in Palakkad, which was scheduled to last for 25 days. It was completed in 22 days on 27 October. By this schedule, Odiyan Manikyan's sexagenarian scenes were over and younger scenes were remaining to be shot. Climax scenes were shot in four locations. The climax fight sequence was filmed inside an Indian banyan tree beside the base of empty Walayar Dam. Action choreographer Peter Hein had around 60 days work in \"Odiyan\". Hein later commented that \"Odiyan\" is his best work to date. The film contains five action scenes. After the second schedule, Mohanlal took break from filming for his physical transformation to become the younger Odiyan Manikyan. He began weight loss training under the supervision of a 22-member personal training team from France. After 51 days, he lost .\n\nIn meantime, the third schedule began by filming night scenes on 12 November in the absence of Mohanlal. The film completed 50 days shooting by 20 November. Mohanlal was to join the sets in December for the fourth schedule. However, the schedule had to be postponed for two more months due to scheduling conflicts with Raj's dates. Finally, the schedule commenced on 3 March 2018. Scenes featuring the younger ages of Odiyan Manikyan, Prabha and Ravunni were filmed in this part. Sana Althaf, Kailash, Narain, Siddique, and Innocent also joined the sets. It was also the final schedule, during which 1960–1970 period was filmed in Palakkad. Odiyan Manikyan's house was created in Kollengode, which is also the native place of screenwriter Harikrishnan.\n\nOlappamanna Mana, an illam situated in Vellinezhi, served as a location in March. The song sequence featuring Mohanlal and Warrier was filmed at the Athirappilly Falls towards the end of the month. A temple-like set was created for the song under the waterfall. In early April, the scene where Odiyan Manikyan swam underwater across the Thenkurissi river was filmed. Manoj Joshi joined the sets in the month. Filming also took place in Vagamon, Idukki district. Principal photography was completed by 25 April after 123 days of shooting. Final schedule alone lasted 50 days. Filming was held in Malampuzha during the final wrap. Later, some pick-up footage was shot in May. After four months and post-production, an additional three-day brief schedule took place from 18 to 20 October in Kochi. Mohanlal also joined. The film in its entirety was completed in 145 days shooting.\n\nThe film's post-production took place in Mumbai, Chennai and Kochi. Mumbai-based company NY VFXWAALA provided the visual effects for the film. Prasad Sutar was the visual effects supervisor. An early estimate for the cost of visual effects during pre-production was 7 crore. The film without the computer graphics and actions scenes were used during the dubbing process. The film was edited by Johnkutty. The length of the screenplay matched with the runtime of the film and none of the scenes in the screenplay were to be removed while editing. The final mixing of the songs was undergoing in August 2018.\n\nThe background score for the film was composed by Sam C. S., making his debut in Malayalam cinema. The film also features five songs composed by M. Jayachandran, the lyrics were written by Rafeeq Ahamed and Lakshmi Shrikumar. \"Kondoram\", a duet from the film was sung by Shreya Ghoshal and Sudeep Kumar, and written by Ahamed. The other four songs were sung by Ghoshal, Shankar Mahadevan, M. G. Sreekumar, and Mohanlal each.\n\nJayachandran began composing the songs in June 2017. Shankar Mahadevan recorded a song in August. For scoring, Menon chose Sam after he was impressed by his work in \"Vikram Vedha\" (2017). Sam joined the film after the songs has been already been composed. He began working on the score in January 2018. Following his usual method, Sam composed the score beforehand based on the screenplay, contrary to the conventional method of scoring the filmed scenes during post-production. The musical score was then used while filming. Since the film had a period setting, old ethnic musical instruments of Kerala was utilised in the score. The film's theme music was chosen from four themes composed by Sam.\n\nThe film is scheduled to be released worldwide on 14 December 2018.\n\nThe concept art of the younger Odiyan Manikyan was revealed through a digital motion poster in July 2017.

It was originally aired by Rede Globo from 1977 to 1993.\n\nOn March 18, 1990, Zacarias died due to respiratory failure, but the group and the series didn't come to an end until July 29, 1994, when Mussum died due to an unsuccessful heart transplant.\n\nThe series consisted of several different minutes scenes featuring comic adventures and situations of the four protagonists, sometimes with just one of them (mostly Didi), two, three and even with all of them, in which they opposed enemies and even each other (these internal fights between them almost every time consisted of Dedé, Mussum and Zacarias against Didi, but Didi, as well as anyone of them who stood by Didi's side, often triumphed over them, very similar to Looney Tunes' Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck rivalry), played pranks on each other or worked together in order to achieve a common goal. There was also throughout the years of the series, several parodies of comics' superheroes, like Superman (mostly played by Didi because of his leader role), Batman (played mostly by Dedé because of Dedé's second banana role and also because of the homosexual interpretations about Batman and him), Spider-Man, Hulk, The Phantom, etc.\n\nThe leader of the group who however, in some scenes, was treated by his three friends as the most worthless member. A very clever man from Ceará with a peculiar manner of speaking. He rarely ended the scenes with bad luck or as the loser, in which he \"fought\" enemies or even his own friends.\n\nInterpreted as a \"second in command\" role. He was the most serious one and acted as the brain of the group. His masculinity was always mocked by Didi.\n\nAn Afro-Brazilian man who was ever proud to say that he came from Morro da Mangueira, a slum in Rio de Janeiro. He also had a very peculiar vocabulary. His greatest passion being cachaça (the most common distilled beverage in Brazil), which he nicknamed \"mé\" (or \"mel\", Portuguese for honey). He was always the butt of jokes and nicknames because of his skin color, as to be sarcastically called \"Maizena\" (Corn Starch) by Didi or then the latter's insinuations and innuendos comparing his skin color to that of a vulture's, at which Mussum would become verbally (sometimes physically) aggressive and answer back with offensive jokes about Didi's own northern origins or even his own mother.\n\nA stocky, little man with child's voice and mannerism — frequently putting on childlike tantrums in face of trouble or even role playing as a kid when the sketch asked for it. He also wore a wig due to baldness. This was exploited in sketches where it would be taken off either by Didi or by any other adversity such as an arrow which, missing his head, stabbed the wig to the wall, for instance.\n\n\nComic book series based on Trapalhões were published in the 80 and 90 respectively by\n\"Bloch Editores\" and Editora Abril, usually in digest size.\n"}

It is usually played with one hand, leaving the other one free to accompany oneself on a drum like the \"tinya\". It is used in a variety of public festivals and other kinds of communal ceremonies.\n\nThe \"pinkillu\" can measure in length up to 1 meter 20 cm, and has six finger holes. It is most commonly made out of cane, but can be made out of bamboo, bone, or tree branches as well. In Peru and Bolivia, sheep and llama nerves are used to tie the instrument together. Among the different kinds there are\n\"ch'aka pinkillu\" (bone flute), \"qina qina pinkillu\" (cane flute) and \"tupa pinkillu\" (made out of thicker \"tuquru\" cane).\n\nThe \"pinkillu\" has great cultural significance. In the Andes the instrument is played during the early rainy season to celebrate cattle and farming. The \"pinkillu\" is often played in pairs or ensembles during the rainy season and at festivals. In Bolivia it is believed that the \"pinkillu\" made from cane attracts rainfall. The \"pinkillu\" is moistened with alcohol or water before playing, and are associated with fertility.\n\n\n"}

Public pressure led to the passage of immorality legislation in 1900.\n\nPrior to independence (1980) colonial vagrancy laws were used against sex workers. In 1983 there was a major effort to eliminate sex work in post-independence Zimbabwe by rounding up hundreds of women and detaining them until they could prove they were not involved in the trade, otherwise they were sent to resettlement camps. A number of women's groups supported this as strengthening marriage.\n\nAs with many African countries, the onset of HIV/AIDS dramatically increased the interest in sex work.\n\nProstitution is addressed in Part III of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act 2004.\n\nThe police can arrest any woman walking (in the streets) after 7pm.\n\nIn 2011 Thabita Khumalo, a MDC-T MP, proposed that prostitution in Zimbabwe be decriminalised. She stated that decriminalizing prostitution would address three important issues: corruption, HIV/Aids and women’s rights.\nKhumalo, who has suggested that the word \"prostitute\" be changed to \"pleasure engineer\", has continued her campaign despite being demoted in her party in 2012. She has claimed her position on the issue may have contributed to this. She is supported by the Zimbabwe Women’s Resource Centre and Network (ZWRCN),\nin addition to sex workers themselves.\n\nThe UK based Open Society Foundation reported in 2012 that the police are the greatest abusers of sex workers in Zimbabwe.\n\nZimbabwe is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and girls from Zimbabwean towns bordering South Africa, Mozambique, and Zambia are subjected to sex trafficking in brothels catering to long-distance truck drivers on both sides of the borders. Zimbabwean women and children are subjected to sex trafficking in cities and surrounding towns. Reports indicate that adults have recruited girls for child sex trafficking in Victoria Falls. The practice of ngozi, giving a family member to another family to avenge the spirits of a murdered relative, creates a vulnerability to trafficking.\n\nZimbabwean women are lured into hospitality largely in neighbouring countries and some women become victims of forced prostitution. Women are exploited in sex trafficking in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Many Zimbabwean adult and child migrants enter South Africa with the assistance of taxi drivers who transport them to the border at Beitbridge or nearby unofficial crossing locations and are subject to sex trafficking. Some of the migrants are transferred to criminal gangs that subject them to forced prostitution in Musina, Pretoria, Johannesburg, or Durban. Refugees from Somalia and Democratic Republic of the Congo reportedly travel from Zimbabwe’s Tongogara Refugee Camp to Harare, where they are forced into prostitution.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Zimbabwe as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51282023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51282023", "title": "Psychedelic rock in Latin America", "text": "Psychedelic rock in Latin America\n\nPsychedelic rock in Latin America is the psychedelic rock music scene in Latin America.\n\nLatin America proved a particularly fertile ground for psychedelic rock. The Brazilian psychedelic rock group Os Mutantes formed in 1966, although little known outside Brazil at the time (due to the fact that they recorded in Portuguese), they have since accrued a substantial international cult following. Os Mutantes also played a central role in the short-lived but revolutionary Brazilian aesthetic movement Tropicália, also known as 'Tropicalismo' (Tropicalism), an anti-authoritarian artistic reaction to the repressive military junta that seized power in Brazil in 1964. Encompassing visual art, theatre, poetry and music, Tropicália combined the popular and the avant-garde, and fused traditional Brazilian culture with foreign influences, including contemporary developments in British and American psychedelic music, and above all the music of The Beatles. As well as recording their own material, Os Mutantes collaborated with other key figures in the burgeoning Tropicalist movement, including singer-songwriter Gilberto Gil, whom they backed on Gil's second LP.\n\nThe musical manifesto of the Tropicalist movement was the landmark 1968 collaborative LP \"\" (\"Tropicalia: or Bread and Circuses\") which brought together the talents of Os Mutantes, Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Tom Zé and Gal Costa, with arrangements by avant-garde composer-arranger Rogerio Duprat (who had studied with Pierre Boulez) and lyrical contributions from poet Torquato Neto. The album's group cover photograph depicted the collective holding a variety of objects and images, in a deliberate reference to the cover of The Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". The collective also performed a number of concert \"happenings\" which were intended to both involve and provoke audiences, and these reportedly had a similar effect on Brazilian audiences to that experienced by folk purists who witnessed Bob Dylan's early \"electric\" concerts - the performers sported long hair, wore outlandish psychedelic costumes, used electric guitars and amplification, and played at full volume. Brazil's military junta was becoming increasingly suspicious of the anarchic anti-establishment attitudes of the \"Tropicalistas\", who also found themselves at odds with the nationalistic student left-wing, who favoured traditional Brazilian musical forms, and rejected what they saw as the corrupting influence of Western pop music.\n\nIn September 1968 Caetano Veloso gave two tumultuous performances at the third annual International Popular Song Festival in Rio, where the audience included a large contingent of left-wing students who were vehemently opposed to the Tropicalistas. When Veloso (backed by Os Mutantes) performed in the first round of the Festival's song competition on 12 September, he was initially greeted with enthusiastic applause, but the situation soon turned ugly. Dressed in a shiny green plastic suit, festooned with wires and necklaces strung with teeth, Veloso provoked the students with his sensual movements and startling new psychedelic music. He was bombarded by insults, jeers and boos from the students, who became even more incensed when American pop singer John Dandurand made a surprise appearance during the song. The ideological conflict climaxed three days later when Veloso returned for the second round of the competition on 15 September, at which he performed a new song entitled \"Prohibido a Prohibir\" (\"It is Forbidden to Forbid\"), which was recorded live and later released as single.\n\nThe students began hissing and booing as soon as Veloso's name was announced, and when he began his performance, his overtly sexual stage moves and the experimental music of Os Mutantes provoked an outpouring of anger - the audience began booing so loudly stood that Veloso could barely be heard, and a large number then stood and turned their backs on the performers, prompting Os Mutantes to turn their backs on the audience. As the song continued, the students pelted the stage with fruit, vegetables, eggs, paper balls and anything else that came hand. Veloso stopped playing and launched into a furious monologue, in which he excoriated the students for their conservatism. After being joined by Gilberto Gil, who came on stage to show his support, Veloso finished his diatribe by telling the students \"... if you are the same in politics as you are in aesthetics, we’re done for!\" and declaring he was withdrawing from the competition. He then deliberately finished the song out of tune, angrily shouted \"Enough!\" and walked off arm-in-arm with Gil and Os Mutantes.\n\nTropicália had a major effect on the Brazilian music scene during its brief heyday (1967–68), and the main performers made regular appearances on Brazilian stage, television and radio, but the movement was abruptly shut down in early 1969, following a provocative December 1968 TV performance which parodied the Brazilian national anthem. Gil and Veloso were both arrested in February 1969 on the orders of the military junta - they were held in prison for three months without charge or trial, and after a further four months under house arrest, they were released on condition that they leave the country, and they spent the next few years in exile in the UK. Others in the Tropicalist movement were treated even more harshly - several were arrested and tortured, or forced to undergo psychiatric 'treatment'.\n\nIn the late 1960s, a wave of Mexican rock, heavily influenced by psychedelia and funk emerged, especially in northern border Mexican states, in particular, Tijuana, Baja California. Among the most recognized bands from this \"Chicano Wave\" (Onda Chicana in Spanish) were Three Souls in my Mind, Love Army, El Ritual and Los Dug Dug's. The Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro was a historic Mexican rock festival held on September 11–12, 1971, on the shores of Lake Avándaro near the Avándaro Golf Club, in the central State of Mexico. The festival, took place at the height of La Onda and celebrated life, youth, ecology, music, peace and free love, has been compared to the American Woodstock festival for its psychedelic music, counterculture imagery and artwork, and open drug use. In Chile from 1967 to 1973, between the ending of the government of President Frei Montalva and the government of President Allende, a cultural movement was born from a few Chilean bands that emerged playing a unique fusion of folkloric music with heavy psychedelic influences. The 1967 release of Los Mac's album \"Kaleidoscope Men\" (1967) inspired bands such as Los Jaivas and Los Blops, the latter going on to collaborate with the iconic Chilean singer-songwriter Victor Jara on his 1971 album \"El derecho de vivir en paz\".. Also Aguaturbia produced psychedelic rock within the chilean late 60s early 70s context with a female vocalist Denise Corales. Piedra Roja was a music festival in Chile noted as an expression of the hippie counterculture in South America. I was held between 10 and 12 October 1970 in the eastern area of Santiago. Among others Aguaturbia, Los Blops, Lágrima Seca and Los Jaivas played in the festival. Meanwhile, in the Argentinian capital Buenos Aires, a burgeoning psychedelic scene gave birth to three of the most important bands in Argentine rock: Los Gatos, Manal and Almendra.\n"}
{"id": "28042876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28042876", "title": "Puss in Boots (2011 film)", "text": "Puss in Boots (2011 film)\n\nPuss in Boots is a 2011 American computer-animated adventure-comedy film produced in 3D format by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount Pictures. Written by Brian Lynch and Tom Wheeler, the film was directed by Chris Miller, who also directed \"Shrek the Third\" (2007). It stars Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Zach Galifianakis, Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris. The film follows the character Puss in Boots on his adventures prior to his first appearance in \"Shrek 2\" (2004). Accompanied by his friends, Humpty Dumpty and Kitty Softpaws, Puss is pitted against Jack and Jill, two murderous outlaws in ownership of legendary magical beans that lead to a great fortune.\n\nThe character of Puss in Boots originated in a European fairy tale in 1697, and the film is a spin-off and prequel to the \"Shrek\" franchise. The film was released in theaters on October 28, 2011, in Digital 3D and IMAX 3D. \"Puss in Boots\" grossed $554.9 million at the box office and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 84th Academy Awards. A television series spin-off from the film titled \"The Adventures of Puss in Boots\" premiered on Netflix in 2015. A sequel titled \"Puss in Boots 2: Nine Lives & 40 Thieves\" was scheduled for release in 2018 but was removed from the studio's schedule in early 2015.\n\nOn November 6, 2018, it was reported by Variety that Chris Meledandri had been tasked to reboot both \"Shrek\" and \"Puss in Boots\", with the original cast potentially returning.\n\nPuss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is a talking cat named for his signature pair of boots. Puss is a fugitive on the run from the law, looking to restore his lost honor. He learns that the outlaw couple Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris) have the magic beans he has been looking for most of his life, which can lead him to a giant's castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss tries to steal them from the outlaws' room, a female cat named Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) interrupts, and both fail. Kitty is allied with Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis), a talking egg and Puss' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage where he was raised. Puss tells Kitty his origin story and of his feelings of betrayal for a youthful misadventure when Humpty tricked Puss into helping commit a bank robbery in his hometown of San Ricardo; Puss has been on the run ever since. Humpty eventually convinces Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs.\n\nThe trio steal the beans from Jack and Jill and plant them in the desert. Puss and Kitty's relationship becomes romantic. The trio ride the beanstalk into the clouds to find the castle of the late giant, while avoiding the Great Terror, a giant goose that guards the Golden Goose. When they realize the golden eggs are too heavy to carry, they steal the Goose, which is just a gosling, and escape the castle. While celebrating their victory, the group is ambushed by Jack and Jill, who knock Puss unconscious.\n\nWhen Puss wakes up, he tracks Jack and Jill to San Ricardo where he learns the entire heist was a plot by Humpty to lure him home to be arrested, as revenge for abandoning him to the authorities when Humpty's youthful heist went bad. Jack, Jill, and Kitty were involved in the con. After pleas from Imelda, his adoptive mother, Puss turns himself in to the guards while Humpty donates many golden eggs to the town and becomes a hero.\n\nWhile in prison, Puss meets the original Jack from \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" who warns him that the Great Terror is in fact the Goose's mother, and it will stop at nothing to get its child back. Realizing Humpty intended to destroy the town all along, Puss lets a repentant Kitty help him break out of prison and she also tells him she loves him. Tracking him down just as the Great Terror arrives, Puss convinces Humpty to help him fight off the Great Terror, saying he knows Humpty is a good person at heart. Using the Goose as bait, Puss and Humpty lure the Great Terror out of the town. During the chase, Jack and Jill betray Humpty and try to take the Goose, but get crushed by the Great Terror. Humpty and the Goose are knocked off a bridge with Puss holding onto them. Humpty knows Puss cannot hold both of them, so he lets go, sacrificing himself to save the Goose and the town. Humpty's shell cracks open to reveal he was a golden egg on the inside. The Great Terror then takes the Goose and Humpty back to the giant's castle.\n\nPuss' efforts to save San Ricardo make him a hero among the townspeople and Imelda. In the epilogue, Jack and Jill are recovering from their injuries, Humpty is shown once again in his regular egg form, wearing a golden egg suit, as he rides the Great Terror into the clouds, and Puss and Kitty kiss.\n\n\nThe film had been in development since 2004, when \"Shrek 2\" was released. As a \"Shrek 2\" spin-off, it was initially planned for release in 2008 as a direct-to-video film, then titled \"Puss in Boots: The Story of an Ogre Killer\". By October 2006, the film was re-slated as a theatrical release due to market conditions, and due to DreamWorks Animation's realization that the Puss character deserved more.\n\nIn September 2010, Guillermo del Toro signed on as executive producer. Discussing del Toro, Miller stated: \"We worked out a system for him to come in once every few months or whenever we had something new to show him. If we needed someone to bounce ideas off of, he was always there, and if we had a problem we were tackling, we'd get Guillermo on the red phone – our emergency phone – and ask him advice on what we should do with a certain character or scene. It was like having our own film school.\" Miller stated that del Toro was particularly involved in Humpty's character design. \"Guillermo loved the dreamy quality of Humpty Dumpty. He suggested we push that further, make him more like da Vinci.\" It was del Toro's idea to make Humpty \"an ingenious freak of nature\" who builds contraptions such as a flying machine. Del Toro rewrote the ending to redeem the character and deepen his relationship with Puss – an unconventional conclusion for a children's film. He helped design the fantasy elements of the giant's castle, as well as the architecture of the town, which he conceived as \"an amalgam of Spain and Mexico\".\n\nExcept for Puss, the film features new characters. Citing the co-writer, David H. Steinberg, \"It doesn't overlap with \"Shrek\" at all. Partly that was done to tell an original Puss story, but partly because we didn't know what \"Shrek 4\" were going to do with the characters and we couldn't write conflicting storylines.\" The film was teased in \"Shrek Forever After\", when Shrek finally shuts the book titled \"Shrek\", and puts it away next to a book titled \"Puss in Boots\".\n\n\"Puss in Boots\" is the first DreamWorks Animation feature film that was partly made in India. A Bangalore studio owned by Technicolor, which had mainly worked on TV specials and DVD bonus material, spent six months animating three major scenes in the film. The outsourcing had financial advantages, with 40% less labor costs than in the US, but the primary reason for outsourcing to India was lack of personnel, due to the studio producing as many as three films a year.\n\nThe release date was originally set for November 4, 2011, but was pushed a week earlier to October 28, 2011. Anne Globe, head of worldwide marketing for DreamWorks Animation, said the decision to move the film's release date a week earlier was to attract parents and their children to see the film before other family-friendly movies were released in November 2011.\n\nThe film was renamed \"Cat in Boots\" in the United Arab Emirates for officially unknown reasons, but it is suspected for religious and cultural reasons. According to the UAE's The National Media Council, which is responsible for censorship, the UAE didn't have any involvement in the rename and that \"the decision to change the name had been made by the Hollywood studio and the movie distributors in the UAE.\" Consequently, since the film's distributor was based in the UAE, the same print was syndicated to all theaters throughout the Middle East. However, the name change was limited to the film's original theatrical run, as merchandise and later regional home media release retained the film's original title.\n\nHenry Jackman, the composer for \"Puss in Boots\", utilized folk instruments of traditional Latin music. Inspired by Spanish composer Manuel de Falla, Jackman blended guitars and Latin percussion with an orchestral sound influenced by Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel. Mexican guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela contributed to Jackman's score, and two of their songs, \"Diabolo Rojo\" and \"Hanuman\" were included in the soundtrack. Lady Gaga's song \"Americano\" was also featured in the film. The soundtrack for the film, featuring the original score by Jackman, was released on October 24, 2011, by Sony Classical.\n\n\"Puss in Boots\" had its world premiere on October 16, 2011, aboard the Royal Caribbean International's cruise ship \"Allure of the Seas\", docked in Fort Lauderdale, Florida at the time. It was theatrically released in the United States on October 28, 2011. The film was digitally re-mastered into IMAX 3D, and was released in 268 North American IMAX theaters and at least 47 IMAX theaters outside North America.\n\nThe film grossed $149,260,504 in North America, and $405,726,973 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $554,987,477. It is the eleventh highest-grossing film of 2011 and is also the third highest-grossing animated film that year behind \"Kung Fu Panda 2\" ($665.7 million) and \"Cars 2\" ($559.9 million).\n\nIn North America, the film topped the box office on its opening day with $9.6 million. On its opening weekend, the film made $34,077,439, topping \"Saw III\"s record ($33.6 million) for the highest Halloween weekend opening ever. It retained first place during its second weekend, with $33,054,644, declining only 3%.\n\nOutside North America, on its opening weekend, it earned second place with $17.2 million. The film opened at #1 in both the UK with a weekend gross of £1.98 million ($3.1 million), and Australia, with $2.98 million. It topped the box office outside North America on its seventh weekend with $47.1 million from 40 countries. It ranks as the ninth highest-grossing film of 2011 outside North America. Its highest-grossing country after North America was Russia and the CIS ($50.6 million), followed by Germany ($33.9 million) and France and the Maghreb region ($33.2 million).\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 84% based on reviews from 147 critics, with an average rating of 6.8 out of 10. The website's consensus is, \"It isn't deep or groundbreaking, but what it lacks in profundity, \"Puss in Boots\" more than makes up for with an abundance of wit, visual sparkle, and effervescent charm.\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 65% based on 24 reviews. CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was an \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nTodd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"\"Puss in Boots\" is a perfectly diverting romp that happens to showcase some of the best 3D work yet from a mainstream animated feature. Colorful, clever enough, free of cloying showbiz in-jokes, action-packed without being ridiculous about it and even well choreographed.\" Peter Debruge of \"Variety\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"Puss' origin story could easily stand on its own -- a testament to clever writing on the part of its creative team and an irresistible central performance by Antonio Banderas.\" Christy Lemire of the \"Associated Press\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"For quick, lively, family friendly entertainment, \"Puss in Boots\" works just fine, even in 3-D, which is integrated thoughtfully into the narrative and doesn't just feel like a gimmick.\" Bill Goodykoontz of \"The Arizona Republic\" gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying \"As good as Banderas and Hayek are together, Galifianakis is better, making Humpty-Dumpty, of all people, one of the more intriguing animated characters to come along in a while. He's a nice surprise.\" Moira MacDonald of \"The Seattle Times\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"I left dreaming of a world in which cats could tango - and when's the last time a movie did that?\" Marjorie Baumgarten of \"The Austin Chronicle\" gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"The seductive interplay of Banderas and Hayek, the barely recognizable vocal contributions of Galifianakis, and the Southern backwoods speech of Thornton and Sedaris all keep us attuned to the events on the screen.\"\n\nOwen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a C, saying \"In the Shrek films, the joke of Puss in Boots, with his trilled consonants and penchant for chest-puffing sword duels, is that no one this cuddly should try to be this dashing. But in \"Puss in Boots\", that joke wears out its welcome in 15 minutes.\" Ty Burr of \"The Boston Globe\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"\"Puss in Boots\" doesn't break any new ground in the storytelling department, and its reliance on go-go-go state-of-the-art action sequences grows wearying by the end, but the movie has a devilish wit that works for parent and child alike.\" Elizabeth Weitzman of the \"New York Daily News\" gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"It's always a pleasure to find a family film that respects its audience all the way up the line.\" Colin Covert of the \"Star Tribune\" gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying \"Remember that toy where you yank a string and hear the sound of a barnyard animal? \"Puss in Boots\" has about half as much entertainment value.\" Olly Richards of \"Empire\" gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"Like most kittens, it's not always perfectly behaved, but at least this new Puss adventure doesn't have you reaching for the cinematic spray bottle. And thank goodness the spin-off does nothing to neuter the charismatic cat's appeal.\" Stan Hall of \"The Oregonian\" gave the film a B, saying \"\"Puss in Boots\" isn't particularly deep, nor does it take itself seriously -- it just wants to seek glory, win affection and cash in. Done, done and done.\"\n\nKenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"Perhaps the most engaging thing about \"Puss in Boots\" is that it never takes itself too seriously.\" Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying \"It is a cheerfully chaotic jumble of fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters parachuted into a Spanish storybook setting.\" Lou Lumenick of the \"New York Post\" gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying \"Basically, this toon is a tired riff on Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns, punctuated by more puns and cat jokes than you can shake a litter box at.\" Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"With his impeccable comic timing and lyrical Spanish accent, Banderas' swashbuckling charmer is an undeniable treat.\" Michael O'Sullivan of \"The Washington Post\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"Puss in Boots\" proves there is at least one cat with multiple lives. The feature-length animated spinoff - a star turn for the popular \"Shrek\" supporting character voiced by Antonio Banderas - is almost shockingly good. And not just because a lot of you will approach it with lowered expectations.\" Stephen Whitty of the \"Newark Star-Ledger\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"An almost purr-fect little film that even a dog owner can enjoy.\"\n\nJoe Morgenstern of \"The Wall Street Journal\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"Puss made his debut in \"\"Shrek 2\",\" then did time in the two decreasingly funny sequels. Now he's got a movie of his own, and not a moment too soon.\" Lisa Kennedy of \"The Denver Post\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"It would overstate matters to say Puss in Boots leaves its cat holding the bag (we had to get that in). But it also leaves its hero awaiting a richer fable, one befitting his charms and his portrayer's talents.\" Anna Smith of \"Time Out\" gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"\"Puss in Boots\" is uneven, but when it's on course, cat fans will be in heaven.\" Amy Biancolli of the \"Houston Chronicle\" gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"\"Puss in Boots\" prances along on three basic truths. One, cats are funny. Two, vain Spanish cats in high-heeled musketeer boots are even funnier. Lastly, booted, vain Spanish cats voiced by a breathy Antonio Banderas are flat-out hilarious.\" Tasha Robinson of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the film a C+, saying \"\"Puss In Boots\" makes a great theme-park ride, a thrill-a-minute feast for the eyes and the semicircular canals.

It is directed by Carlos Cuarón and produced by Cha Cha Cha Films. It is Carlos Cuarón's first full-length movie.\n\nIn the fictional farming village of Tachatlán, in the Cihuatlán Valley of Jalisco, Mexico, young men dream of escaping the drudgery of the banana plantations. Two of them, a pair of half-brothers, play in local football matches. Tato (Gael Garcia) is the star striker and Beto (Diego Luna) is the eccentric goalkeeper. During one match they are spotted by a talent scout (Guillermo Francella) and he offers one of them the opportunity to go to Mexico City with him and try out for one of the country's big teams. As the scout's roster is already full, he says he can only take one of the brothers and they decide to settle it on a penalty shot. Tato scores the penalty against his brother, therefore earning the right to head to the capital.\n\n\nCarlos Cuarón first formed the idea for the film while on a promotional tour for \"Y tu mamá también\". He initially planned for only one character, but later decided to include a brother.\n\nPrincipal photography began in summer 2007 in Cihuatlán, Mexico. The banana plantation where the brothers work in the film is actually owned by the Cuarón family. For his role Bernal wore blonde extensions to lengthen his hair while Luna dyed his hair black and grew a mustache to play the older brother. Additional filming took place in México City and Toluca.\n\n\"Rudo y Cursi\" released on December 2008 in Mexico. It premiered internationally at the April 2009 San Francisco International Film Festival and was screened at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and the Tribeca Film Festival. It was released generally, on a limited basis, on May 8, 2009. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on August 25, 2009.\n\n\"Rudo y Cursi\" was very successful at the box office. It became the sixth top grossing Mexican movie of all time. In its first two weeks in the US, it earned $738,706 on 219 screens. It eventually grossed $9,264,208 in overseas earnings, bringing its worldwide total to $11,091,868.\n\n"}

The Sarasaviya ceremony is one of the oldest film events in Sri Lanka. The awards were first introduced in 1964. The Sarasaviya Awards have been often referred to as the Sinhala Cinema industry's equivalent to The Oscars.\n\nThe Sarasaviya film awards ceremony began in 1964 at a time when the local cinema was trying to shed its South Indian orientation and establish an indigenous identity. There was no need to go to India to make films any more and the era of Indian artistes too had ended.\n\nThe first Sarasaviya film festival was held on May 9, 1964 at the Asoka Cinema Hall, Colombo, 17 years after the first Sinhala film screened. By then a series of good Sinhala films like Podi Putha, Rekhawa, Sandeshaya, Ranmuthuduwa, Kurulubedda, Sikurutharuwa and Gamperaliya had appeared on screen. Yet the mainstream consisted of simulations of Indian productions.\n\nThe year 1960 is seen as the beginning of the golden era of Sinhala cinema. The first Sarasaviya Awards Festival had as entries not only the films screened in 1963 but also the films screened from 1960 to 1963. The best film, best director, best script-writer, best actor and best actress were honoured that day. Gamperaliya was regarded as the best film and it was awarded to its producer Anton Wickremasinghe. Sir Lester James Peiris and Regi Siriwardena won the awards for best director and best script-writer, respectively and that too was for Gamperaliya. D.R. Nanayakkara was awarded the best actor title for his performance in Sikuru Tharuwa, another popular film in the 1964 film festival. The best actress award was received by Punya Heendeniya for her performance in Gamperaliya.\n\nThe awards festival was suspended by the Rajapaksa administration and were resumed in 2016 after Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka announced that the festival will resume under the new government.\n\nIn 2004, there were 33 awards in total, including the 12 prominent awards. However, this varies from year to year. Following is a brief list of the Award winners from each category for each year since 1964. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a 4-hander and is played either with a French-suited Piquet deck or German playing cards. Cards rank in their natural order: Ace/Sow, King, Queen/Ober, Jack/Unter, Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven.\n\nAfter cutting the pack to decide on the seating order and dealer will be, the dealer pays eight tokens to the pot. He then shuffles the pack and the player to his left cuts it. The bottom card of the top packet is turned as trumps – it belongs to the dealer – then each player is dealt eight cards in two packets of four in anti-clockwise order. Forehand leads to the first trick. Thereafter the trick winner leads to the next one. Players must follow suit, trump if unable, or play any card if they cannot follow or trump. Players must head the trick if possible.\n\nFor each trick won, players receive one token from the pot. Forehand becomes the new dealer and pays his eight tokens to the pot.\n\nThe game continues either for a pre-agreed number of rounds (each round being 4 deals) or when one player reaches an agreed number of tokens.\n\nIn 1993, a new game marketed as Sticheln was launched in Germany.

It was published in book form in 1907.\n\nThe stories included are as follows:\n\nAmbrose Calverley, who has travelled and adventured for many years, returns to England on the death of his father. Inheriting the title and estates of Lord Lynborough, he takes up residence at Scarsmore Castle on the coast of Yorkshire, with his friends Leonard 'Cromlech' Stubb, an ancient history researcher, and Roger Wibraham, his private secretary. Fond of sea bathing, he finds that the path to the beach, the 'Beach Path', which passes through the grounds of Nab Grange (formerly part of the Calverley estate), has been blocked off by the new owner, the widowed Anglo-Italian lady Helena, Marchesa di San Servolo. Although neither meet, a dispute begins between them concerning access to the path. Neither will give way, the lady is prepared to go to court and Lynborough calls her bluff. After a stalemate, Lynborough persuades his friends to pay court to the ladies staying with the Marchesa. Seeing her chance, she applies a similar strategy to Lynborough’s companions, creating a wedge in his resolve. Persuaded by her lawyer that her legal case is very weak, the lady accepts a compromise presented to her by an 'embassy' sent by Lynborough. He demands the right to use the path, if she will allow him to visit her to present his 'homage' once a year on the day of St John Baptist. She graciously accepts. It is implied that they will eventually marry. And the Beach Path is renamed 'Helena’s Path'.\n\nThe story is narrated by Tregaskis, a country gentleman, who is invited to the manor of Mr and Mrs Thistleton to meet the exiled Princess Vera of Boravia. Mr Thistleton, a lawyer, is negotiating for the return of the Princess’s private fortune, but is unsuccessful. To pay off his fee, the impoverished princess is forced to accept the position of governess in the household, known simply as Fräulein Friedenburg. When a neighbour, an up-and-coming stockbroker, becomes engaged to the eldest daughter of the house, instead of the princess (as she had hoped), she is forced to leave. A respectable situation is found for her, but as she leaves, a revolution breaks out in her country. She travels to Vienna, with expenses paid by Tregaskis, who is the only one who actually believed her story. It transpires later that she has indeed become Queen of Boravia.\n\nPrince Julian, pretender to the throne of a European country, is living in London with the mysterious Mrs Rivers. Byers, a financial speculator, is persuaded by her to provide support to the prince, but in fact contrives rumours that will cause the country’s stock to rise and fall in value. In the end, the prince does not return to his country, but he does marry Mrs. Rivers. Byers makes a fortune and later stands for Parliament.\n\nMr Foulkes, a solicitor, narrates the tale of Sir Thomas Gladwin of Worldstone Park, a rich country gentleman. A widower, he is engaged to Nettie Tyler, a girl many times younger than he is, and he has altered his Will in her favour. Four days before the wedding, he is killed in a horse riding accident. The Will has not been formalised and the estate goes to his daughter Beatrice, who had largely been cut out of her inheritance. She allows Nettie to remain on the estate with the uncertain status of 'companion'. A year later, Beatrice accedes to the unspoken feelings of the local 'county set' and makes over £100,000 in her favour. Shortly after, Nettie becomes engaged to neighbouring impoverished landowner Captain Spencer Fullard who had once paid court to Beatrice. She reveals to Foulkes that she did it to stop Fullard proposing marriage to herself.\n\nThe narrator tells of the Clinton family. Mrs Clinton is a well-known novelist and a centre of literary society, whilst her husband is content to live in her shadow. He has let it be known that he also 'writes', but nothing much is known of what he writes. Eventually, a large two-volume work emerges and is taken up by his wife’s publishers more as a favour than anything else. The work is an unexpected success and the gaze of the literary set turns from Mrs Clinton to her Husband.\n\nKatherine Constantine is rich, pretty and the object of interest to two men; Valentine Hare of the Colonial Office, and Oliver Kirby, also in the government. She is proposed to by Hare, but she keeps him waiting for an answer. Family and friends all volunteer opinions and advice. She discusses the matter with a friend, Mr Wynne. When Hare is elevated to the Secretaryship for the Colonies, Miss Constantine decides to marry Kirby. They immediately leave for Canada, where Kirby hopes to enter politics.\n\nGentleman thief James Walsh, known as Slim-Fingered Jim, has been convicted for involvement in a bond robbery and sentenced to seven years in prison. In a country house garden one evening, Mrs Pryce confides to a friend that she met Walsh several years previously on a ship travelling from America. She was much taken with his suave and debonair manner, even after he confessed to her his involvement in a swindle. He was later arrested but found not guilty. She hopes that he can tolerate his prison sentence.\n\nThe Petheram family are landed gentry, but as a large family, their expenditure exceeds their income. One daughter has already married into the aristocracy, but Winifred chooses to become engaged to Harold Jackson, who has a small income only. Harold takes Winifred to London to see the house he proposes to rent for them. It’s the best they can afford, but Winifred is horrified at the small size and dirtiness of the proposed home. She is even more horrified that Harold has ignored the new grey costume she has specially worn for the occasion. She breaks the engagement, and it is implied that she may marry a wealthy former suitor instead.\n\nOne evening in a London club, The Colonel relates a story of a friend, George Langhorn, who inherited the ownership of Stretchleys, a high-class Savile Row tailor, but hates it. He is persuaded to take a break in Monte Carlo, where he meets the pretty and rich Miss Minnie Welford. It transpires that she has inherited half-ownership of a mass-production clothing company Sky-High Tailoring, which she also hates. The couple quickly become engaged and marry. One of the Colonel’s listeners, a lawyer, then reveals that the week before, the companies amalgamated, with Langhorn as Chairman of the joint concern.\n\nMiss Prudence, eldest daughter of a vicar with a large family, is expected to marry money.

They exchange words and comfort each other before they mount the scaffold.\n\nThe walled city of Or is being besieged by King Stanislas, but the ruler of the city, Countess Runa, has held out and defied the King’s angry demands. She claims that the city cannot be defeated until a riddle she has presented to him is solved. A prisoner is brought to her, who claims to be a renegade from the King’s army. He is given sanctuary for seven days and nights and will be released if he has solved the riddle. On the final morning, he reveals himself to be the King, as Runa had known all along, and proposes a truce. And so peace reigns in the Kingdom.\n\nThe rich young Duke of Belleville (pronounced Bevvle) visits his villa near Hampstead Heath, but late at night, he feels lonely and bored. He bribes a passing policeman to change clothes with him and goes on patrol to check the doors and windows of his neighbours. Returning, he sees a young man outside his villa. He claims that he’s the Duke of Belleville (pronounced Bevvle) who has lost his key. Intrigued, the real Duke assists the imposter to enter. It's soon clear that he knows about, and plans to steal, the valuable 'Queen Bess Flagon'. A young lady, clearly an accomplice, arrives in a brougham. The real Duke changes clothes back with the policeman, snatches the flagon and runs across the heath, chased by the imposter. The chasers are confronted by a real policeman, an inspector who lives nearby; he recognises the fake Duke of Belleville (pronounced Bevvle) as a confidence trickster and arrests him. The real Duke, heartily enlivened by the night’s excitement, refuses to prefer charges and the would-be thief is allowed to go free. He graciously presents the flagon to the (still anonymous) lady and she also leaves.\n\nThe Duke, again bored with life, decides to take a small cottage and allotment in a country district and pass himself off as an out-of-work labourer. Unused to physical work, he is soon exhausted from his digging, and is visited by a formidable lady who believes him to be a drunkard. Affecting a Somersetshire accent, the Duke enjoys the deception. The lady sends her daughter to try to reform him. The house is later surrounded by other neighbours and police who have mistaken him for a thief believed to have burgled silver plate from a nearby manor house. The Duke takes to his heels, pursued by the local Chief Constable and others, but evades them. He returns home, accompanied by the lady, and resumes his true identity, much to her amusement.\n\n\n"}

She entered the British adult industry in 2009 and now divides her time between London and Los Angeles. Her stage name is inspired by her interest in comic books and by the way in which Stan Lee gave his characters first and last names with the same initial. Tate is best known for her appearances in the MILF genre; she has nine \"MILF of the Year\" wins to her credit.\n\nAfter beginning her porn career in 2009, Tate began contributing to a regular column for British adult magazine \"Ravers DVD\" in 2010. She is perhaps best known for her contributions to the MILF genre of the adult industry with numerous award wins. Tate is also known for her appearances in porn parodies such as \"Game of Bones\" (an adult parody of \"Game of Thrones\"), \"The Incredible Hulk XXX\", and \"Iron Man XXX\".\n\nLater that same year Tate made headlines in Ireland, after it was discovered that one of the amateur men who participated in the filming of her Television X series \"Tanya Tate’s Sex Tour of Ireland\", was Gaelic Athletic Association player Greg Jacobs. Tate travelled the countryside in a camper van meeting genuine Irish men and filmed both softcore and hardcore pornography. Jacobs denied that he appeared in the video, but then admitted, \"I don't regret doing it\", noting that he didn't want his parents to know. He appeared in the video following a dare from his friends. \"Tanya Tate's Casting Couch\" series ended in March 2013.\n\nTate directed her first film for Filly Films called \"Tanya Tate's the MILF Masseuse\" in 2011. Her work as director for Filly Films continued in 2012 with two titles \"Tanya Tate's Runaways\" and \"Tanya Tate's Tea & Muffin Party\".\n\nTate is outspoken about her industry and was quoted in a story about the 2013 AVN Awards for which she was nominated for an award. She stated, \"If you are more popular with the fans, companies are more likely to book you for their production\", and that \"Being nominated for awards help build your recognition with your fan base. People that win male and female performer of the year are generally solid consistent talent that are open to many 'levels,' and some of these performers already have higher basic rates than others\".\n\nOn 5 December 2013, Tate was the host of the 4th annual SHAFTA Awards at the Rise Superclub in Leicester Square. She was also nominated for several awards that night and won \"MILF of the Year\" for the fourth year running. Then in January 2014, Tate was France's Hot Vidéo magazine correspondent conducting red-carpet interviews at the AVN Awards.\n\nSince her 2010 San Diego ComicCon convention debut dressed as Emma Frost, Tate has gained the attention of several media outlets, from Life.com, Getty Images, KTLA.com and the Orange County Register to BleedingCool.com, NerdReactor.com, Cosmic Book News and GirlsGoneComic.com, as a cosplayer. Earlier in the year, Tate was featured by IGN.com in an interview article called \"Tanya Tate: Cosplayer Extraordinaire\". In that interview, she explains how the stage name she uses for her adult industry performances was inspired by how comic book writer Stan Lee named his characters using the same letter in their first and last names. Tate was also named the \"Cosplay Girl of the Month\" by ComicImpact.com in April and in June was selected as Critiques4Geeks.com’s first ever \"Geek Babe of the Month\".\n\nTate's 2010 ComicCon appearance also resulted in the publishing of her first book, \"Tanya Tate: My Life in Costume\". Tate has become a contributing writer for the websites WorldOfSuperheroes.com and Geekscape.net. In 2011, as part of her interest in cosplay and in conjunction with that year's ComicCon convention, Tate launched a costume design contest. The winning entrant won a lunch date with Tanya during Comic-Con.\n\nIn 2013, Tate was the cover model for the Turkish version of FHM magazine. Also that year, she was featured in two documentaries. The first was Deborah Anderson's feature documentary and accompanying art book, \"Aroused\" (), a theatre-released film profiled the lives of several adult industry performers during the production of Anderson’s photobook of the same name. It was released in cinemas in the US summer 2013 and internationally in January 2014. The second was for the United Kingdom-broadcast Channel 4 television show \"Date My Porn Star\", where a film crew accompanied one of Tate's fans from Britain to her home in Los Angeles to meet the performer.\n\nSince 2011 she has operated a cosplay-themed website and blog called justalottatanya.com. Tate also operates a publicity company.\n\nIn 2013, Tate began several partnerships and cooperative ventures. She announced a line of action figures, unveiled a co-created comic book character, and syndicated blogs for HollywoodGoneGeek.com and FirstComicsNews.com. In April 2014, Tate's \"Lady Titan\" was introduced at that year's WonderCon pop-culture convention in Anaheim, California.\n\nIn March 2014, a collaboration was announced between Tate and the newly launched \"cougars.xxx\" website owned by the Luxembourg based Lilly Devine SA company. CEO Moriam Hassan Balogun commented, \"Tanya is not only an established professional with great ideas and a total understanding of what MILF fans want but also a major favourite within the industry\". Then in April 2014, Tate began hosting a live weekly radio show on the Vivid radio channel of the Sirius XM Radio network called the \"Tanya Tate Show\".\n\nTate debuted her latest line of action figures, a customizable vinyl figure line called My Hero Toys, in October 2014. The new line of figures was announced at Stan Lee's annual event, the Comikaze Expo in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2012, Tate appeared on behalf of the Free Speech Coalition at a press conference for the \"No on Government Waste\" Committee, which opposed Los Angeles County's Measure B; the mandatory condom and health permit initiative.\n\nWith regard to Measure B, Tate was quoted in a San Fernando Valley Business Journal article to the effect that she would want whomever she decided to have sex with \"to get tested until I felt comfortable to sleep with them without a condom,\" adding that AIDS Healthcare Foundation president Michael Weinstein (whom the article was about), \"should be spending money on treating [AIDS] and educating regular people about how to protect themselves instead of going after a small community that is aware of the risks\".\n\nIn response to Samuel Jackson's comments about RedTube, the free porn-sharing website, at a May press conference for his 2014 movie \"\", Tate said that piracy impacts her directly because she produces her own web content. She stated, \"I would gladly send a catalog of adult movies I have directed to Mr. Jackson if he would be so kind as to recant the comment\".\n\nIn December 2014, Tate was outspoken regarding new regulations imposed on online content in the United Kingdom. In an interview she stated, \"Female ejaculation being banned is not only a slap in the face to women across the UK, but proof that men making these rules do not see women as equals. The lads can enjoy a good pop shot, but should a woman come, all hell breaks loose\". Another item listed as banned content was \"Role-playing as non-adults\" which prompted Tate to state, \"Can you say, 'Oh you're a naughty boy?' Or can you not say that because you cannot role-play as non-adults? Can you call someone a 'naughty boy' or do you have to say 'naughty man?' Who is going to monitor this?\"\n\nTate has stated that she is bi-curious. She is also a lifelong fan of Liverpool Football Club. She is a cosplay enthusiast and uses an alter ego by the name of \"Lady Titan\". Tate announced her pregnancy on 16 June 2017. She tweeted that she gave birth to a boy on 30 November 2017.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56521178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56521178", "title": "The Bible and humor", "text": "The Bible and humor\n\nThe Bible and humor is a topic of Biblical criticism concerned with the question of whether parts of the Bible were intended to convey humor in any style. Historically, this topic has not received much attention, but modern scholars generally agree that humor can be found in biblical texts.\n\nFinding humor in the Bible, for those who hold reverence toward the Bible, can be hindered by that seriousness, but it can be difficult for anyone because humor does not translate well from culture to culture or from language to language. It is also difficult to pick up on humor in written form. The age of the texts makes it difficult to be sure that what we are interpreting as humor was intended as humor by the author. Finding humor in the Bible requires a broad eclectic definition of humor and some awareness of literary types of humor such as satire, farce, parody, irony and so on. Therefore, the vast majority of Bible interpreters over the last 1,500 years have not only not detected humor in the Bible, they have often discounted or even disdained the possibility of humor in the Bible.\nProfessor Yehuda T. Radday notes that some scholars have flat out denied that humor in the Bible exists. He references a 1984 conference in Israel on the subject of Jewish humor, where no attention was given to humor in the Bible. Radday goes on to say \"it is a widespread misconception that the Bible is lacking in humor.\"\n\nScholars like Steven C. Walker, a professor of literature, and Howard R. Macy, a professor of religion, claim humor is prevalent in the Bible. Macy says that \"if we think that humor in the Bible mostly looks like stand-up comedy or telling jokes, we won't see much of that.\" Anthony J. Perotta, priest and professor at Fuller Seminary, argues that:\n... humor as we know it today is probably not part of the Bible any more than love (and marriage, etc.) as we know it today is a feature of the Bible. But this is a minor point, maybe even trivial and pedantic. ... The ancient Hebrews loved and married—and joked—no doubt, in a different idiom than \"we\" do, but they still engaged in such activities and we can speak about those activities without being anachronistic or solipsistic\n\nProfessor of Jewish theology and Near Eastern studies Leonard Greenspoon says, \"In sum, biblical humor is certainly not stand-up comedy nor is it especially cerebral either. Rather, it is participatory and fully in keeping with the overall themes and emphases of the Hebrew Bible.\" Author David A. Peters states that he finds over a thousand \"humorous lines and stories\" in the Bible.\n\nThere is general agreement the kind of humor that \"can\" be found in the Bible becomes apparent when the Bible is viewed as literature. Rev. Marion Daniel Shutter asserts we would find genuine wit if, in literature other than the Bible, we came across sentences such as that found in Proverbs 26:17: \"Interfering in someone else's argument is as foolish as yanking a dog's ears\". He says, \"When Isaiah characterizes certain ones as 'mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink,' does he not use essentially the same reproach Prince Hal fastened upon Falstaff, 'Wherin is he good but to taste sack and drink it?\" Macy says the Bible authors use dark humor, satire, a great deal of wit, and are particularly fond of the dry humor that goes with exaggeration. Walker adds, \"The humor of the Bible is deadpan. It sneaks up on you.\"\n\nWhen discussing biblical humor scholars generally agree humor is often in the situation itself. Macy gives the examples of Sarah having Isaac at the age of ninety, and the Messiah turning up in a barn. Macy says \"The Bible gives us tale after tale of comic reversals and narrow escapes.\" He says \"mischievous exploits\", names and name changes, literary plays on words, exaggeration, and the unexpected: a surprising word, an unexpected phrase, or an abrupt change of direction are what the Bible uses to convey wit and humor. According to Macy, the book of Proverbs includes funny images and word-play while \"trickster themes also bring surprise and laughter.\" Professor of Biblical Literature J. William Whedbee says the biblical authors use \"humorous juxtaposition\" where things seem funny because they're together: for example, short and tall, fat and thin, irony and paradox. Those scholars who do find humor in the Bible agree the odd, awkward, or absurd such as mismatches in character and actions, are examples of how the Bible uses humor. \"Balaam the 'seer' who doesn't 'see' or 'know' what's going on, and his donkey who both sees and knows,\" is an example of this type of wit and humor in the Bible.\n\nMacy, Walker, M. D. Shutter, and other scholars contend Genesis has several stories that offer humor through absurdity, trickery, surprises and reversals. Macy says that in speaking of humor in the Bible he usually begins with asking how it might feel to personally get the message Abraham and Sarah received, putting them into the absurd situation of a ninety year old having a baby. He argues that the Biblical author shows that the situation is replete with humor: \"Abraham laughs, Sarah laughs, everybody else laughs, and they name the baby 'laughter' or He-laughs [Isaac Yitzack].\" \n\nHumor in Genesis, Macy says, includes \"Both Abraham and Isaac trying to pass off their wives as their sisters, [however] translations of Genesis 26:8 range from [Isaac and his 'sister'] \"laughing together\" to \"caressing\" or \"fondling\" to \"making love\" giving evidence of Isaac's 'savvy' in pulling off the lie. Jacob and Laban make deals with each other that make a reader cringe. In Genesis 18, the topic is serious but bargaining with God looks a lot like buying a used car.\"\n\nWalker says Genesis contains several \"odd couples\" that contrast and complement each other like 'Laurel and Hardy': Jacob and Esau, Abraham and Sarah, Abraham and Lot, Jacob and Laban, Moses and Aaron, and others. He adds, \"Bible characters learn a lot about their own 'dark sides' by those contrasts.\" The pattern of reversal of fundamental motifs such as primogeniture are evidence of humor according to Walker. He references 12 incidents in Genesis of younger sons getting the better of their elder brothers.\n\nGreenspoon offers Genesis 4 as an example of Biblical humor using ironic wordplay with names. After murdering his brother and attempting to shift the blame, Cain is condemned to wander ceaselessly, but after complaining God agrees to let him settle in the land of Nod. Greenspoon says, \"The root of the Hebrew verb 'to wander' is \"n-w-d\" and \"the proper name 'Nod' derives from the same root as the verb 'to wander'... What sort of settling is Cain likely to experience in a land whose very name connotes (constant) wandering?\"\n\nGreenspoon says Aaron's response to getting caught after making the golden calf is humorous. \"Does Aaron come clean when confronted by his enraged brother...? Not exactly. He does attempt to shift blame—\"You know this people is bent on evil\". He also admits to asking the people for their gold, at the same time notably truncating the scope of his original request... \nEven though the biblical text had earlier narrated in some detail the active role he took ... [he says]: 'They gave it to me', Aaron concludes, 'and I hurled it into the fire and out came this calf'.\"\n\nPetrotta and others find plenty of humor in the story of Balaam and his talking donkey in the Book of Numbers. Balaam is repeatedly asked by king Balak to curse the Israelites, but Balaam can only bless them, making the king increasingly angry.\n\nShutter finds humor in the \"Fable of the Trees\" (Judges 9). Abimelech maneuvered to have himself proclaimed king in Shechem, but Jotham believed he was unfit to rule and the people foolish to accept him. Jotham contrives a satire. \"The trees went forth to anoint a king over them. They said to the olive tree, 'reign over us.' But the olive tree answered, ‘Should I give up my oil, by which both gods and humans are honored, to hold sway over the trees?’ Next, the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and be our king.’ But the fig tree replied, ‘Should I give up my fruit, so good and sweet, to hold sway over the trees?’ Then the trees said to the vine, ‘Come and be our king.’ But the vine answered, 'Should I give up my wine, which cheers both gods and humans, to hold sway over the trees?' Finally all the trees said to the thornbush, 'Come and be our king'. The thornbush said to the trees, 'If you really want to anoint me king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, then let fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon!'\" Then Jotham left \"for in that day, as in every subsequent age, there was no room for a satirist in the kingdom of an incompetent ruler\". \n\nShutter also asserts that Samson is a humorous character, very similar to Ajax in Sophocles' play \"Ajax\". Quoting Rev. A. G. L'Estrange in his \"History of English humor...\", Shutter says: \"He was an exaggeration of a not very uncommon type of man in which brute strength is joined to loose morals and whimsical fancy... We can only smile at his folly.\"\n\nGreenspoon finds humor in the word play of the names and characteristics of two protagonists found in the account of the murder of the King of Moab in the second half of Judges 3. One of these characters is Ehud, a \"left-handed man\" from the tribe of Benjamin (Judg 3:15). \"Such a description serves two functions here: first, as a play on words-—Ehud's tribe, Benjamin, literally means the son of the south, or right. (Ancient Israelites oriented themselves with the Mediterranean Sea behind them and East was straight ahead; so, the south was to their right.) Thus, it would not escape the notice of the reader that here was a \"son of the south\" or \"the right hand\" who was left-handed... Second, because Ehud was left-handed, he strapped his sword to his right thigh... the Moabite king's bodyguards, who would certainly have checked out anyone seeking admittance to their monarch, performed only a perfunctory check on Ehud, never thinking that the weapon would be on his right, rather than the expected left, thigh. It is especially the name of the Moabite king, Eglon, that would have immediately attracted the attention of an ancient reader ... Eglon comes from the same Hebrew root as the word for a fatted calf, often one prepared for sacrifice. And, of course, sacrifice is exactly what Eglon becomes at the hand of Ehud... biblical writers seemed to draw upon just such incidents to display what might be termed the wicked side of their humor.\"\n\nAccording to Shutter, Nabal, a rich man who insults David, is a dark comic character similar to Squire Western in the classic comedy \"Tom Jones\" by Henry Fielding. \"He is churlish and evil... blunt in speech, rude, and even boorish in manners... The servants of Nabal say, \"He is such a son of Belial [a devil] that a man cannot speak to him!' He is fond of wine and sometimes falls asleep over his cups.\" Fielding uses Squire Western's comic character to criticize the legal system that allowed men like this to judge others because of their social position. The author of Samuel uses Nabal to make similar observations of the 'leaders' of Israel.\n\nIn this same story Greenspoon finds humor in names and wordplay. The root of Nabal's name—\"n-b-l\"—(and the word \"fool\") appears as two nouns one of which appears in the expression for \"wine skin\"; Nabal is a drunk. \"The second noun from 'n-b-l' is a feminine form ending with the Hebrew letter he. With the vocalization (that is, vowels) I am thinking of, the word means carcass or corpse. Surely, Nabal was a 'dead man' when he crossed David as he did. The same consonants also make up a noun meaning 'foolishness', the very noun that Abigail used to describe her husband in her plea to David. Reading back then, we can sense a double play on words, as it were, by the narrator of this account\".\n\nWalker says, \"The Bible reads like a rogue's gallery of unlikely heroes... Gideon the coward, Samson the bully, David the trickster\". He gives the example of the powerful and popular warrior David fleeing Saul's murderous jealousy by going to Achish king of Gath, then deciding he'd made a mistake, and coping with that by faking insanity. Macy says this entire scene with David is humorous, but King Achish's response is the epitome of Biblical sarcasm: \"Am I so short on insane people in my own kingdom you bring me more from other places?\" David fools Achish--then later goes to work for him. Walker says this demonstrates \"David's trickster aspect is an equal-employment jester, 'laughable for how it succeeds in duping others and how it recoils to dupe the mischiefmaker\".\n\nReligion Professor and Presbyterian minister Conrad Hyers finds humor in Elijah's ridicule of \"the priests of Baal who wailed and slashed themselves in the hope that Baal would send fire from Heaven. \"Shout louder!...Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling; or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened!\" (1 Kings 18)\n\nAll scholars who find humor in the Bible agree it can be found in the book of Proverbs. Shutter gives numerous example such as: \"A man of great anger will bear the penalty, for if you rescue him, you will only have to do it again. In other words, a man of violent temper is always getting into difficulties; you have no sooner helped him out of one than he has plunged madly into another. Like the irascible person in the old nursery rhyme, who \"jumped into a bramble bush and scratched out both his eyes\", he is no sooner extricated than \"with all his might and main, he jumps into another bush and puts them out again.\" \nShutter also says humor is often used to communicate morality claiming \"Can a man take fire in his bosom And his clothes not be burned?\" is a sarcastic question about adultery. Shutter includes \"Wealth makes many \"friends\"; poverty drives them all away\" and \"Many curry favor with a ruler, and everyone is the friend of one who gives gifts\" as social satire. \n\n\"All the brothers of a poor man hate him; How much more do his friends abandon him! He pursues them with words, but they are gone.\" Shutter references this Proverb as humor by citing a comparison with Thackeray: \"Thackeray has drawn such a picture in his more elaborate description of Harry Warrington in the sponging house, making vain appeals for help to his rich relatives and friends. His Aunt, a member of the great and always established Church of the Pharisees, sent him her blessing--and a tract!\"\n\nShutter says biting Biblical humor often gives insight into human nature: \"All people spend their lives scratching for food, but they never seem to have enough.\"\n\nRidicule and political commentary have gone hand in hand for many centuries. According to Shutter, when Jeremiah describes the disaster that fell on Egypt's allies, the comments that follow to the King of Egypt drip with scorn: \"Pharaoh, King of Egypt, is but a noise. He hath let the appointed time pass by.\" \"In the same spirit, Queen Catherine says of the dead Wolsey, \"His promise was as he then was, mighty; but his performance is as he is now, nothing.\"\n\nWalker explains that \"A crucial function of humor in the Bible is to persuade the self-righteous to laugh at themselves--a process that proves especially enlightening when the self-righteous turn out to be us. Jonah sasses God. Heathen Ninevites and scurrilous sailors prove more pious than the prophet [Jonah], who is subjected unceremoniously to his comeuppance.\" Shutter points out that Jonah pouts when the Ninevites repent and are not destroyed; he yells at God, 'didn't I know this would happen?' without recognizing the irony in his own comments which is itself ironic. Shutter compares this to the character Mr. Mantalini in Charles Dickens' \"Nicholas Nickleby\".\n\nLeonard Greenspoon says \"Like Jonah, the book of Esther is filled with a number of plots and subplots, the humor of which is not always immediately evident.\" The proud Haman is unaware of his comic nature, but the reader knows the very real irony that \"everything Haman plans against his enemies will ultimately be done to him\". \n\nWalker finds humor in the comic reversal in Esther. The king asks one night, \"What should be done for a man whom the king desires to honor?\" (6:6). Haman assumes the king means Haman himself and answers in vivid detail. He is then required to give it all to his worst enemy. Walker also points out the pivotal role in the book of Esther is built around a female, which is a situation filled with cultural commentary and irony. Walker says, \"The wit of Esther, by turning our usual expectations upside down, reminds us to expect the unexpected.\" He says \"I second Adele Berlin's ranking of Esther high among \"the most humorous books of the Bible, amusing throughout, and at certain points uproriously funny.\" People who have looked closely find the book so funny \"Esther emerges as perhaps the clearest embodiment of the comic vision among all the Biblical narratives.\" \n\nWalker and Macy both cite the careful attention to words and wordplays in this book, while Walker also includes Esther in what he calls \"genial gender humor\" where, he says, women often prove to be \"more dynamic characters\" than their male counterparts and always seem to get the \"last scriptural word\".\n\nGreenspoon explains \"the wisdom and/or bravery exhibited by women and other \"outsiders\" is often expressed or acted out at the expense of those who appear to wield the most power. This is in keeping with the frequently articulated theme of biblical humor that demonstrates and reflects God's infinite ability to disrupt the plans of finite humans, especially the seemingly powerful.\"\n\nHyers says \"Paul had an unusual way of selling the gospel. His techniques have not been widely followed... Nor has he been hailed as a pioneer in the world of advertising. [Paul's] term for the Christian faith is \"foolishness\". The cross is foolishness. Preaching is foolishness. Christians are called to be \"fools for Christ's sake\". The Apostles are ridiculed as fools, \"a spectacle to the world, to angels and to men\" (1 Cor.4:9).\" Hyers says themes of divine foolishness overturning human wisdom form the plot lines of many Bible stories and such reversals are familiar in comedy as well. Macy says, \"In his letters Paul reveals a robust sense of humor... He teases to teach, uses grand exaggeration, enjoys parody and reversal, and even creates vivid comic [word] pictures.\" For example in 2 Corinthians 11, Paul uses a biting sarcasm to give what has been termed his \"anti-autobiography\" while calling himself a fool.\n\nHyers says \"Jesus freely used humor, irony and satire\" and offers the examples of \"the blind leading the blind; straining out a gnat, then swallowing a camel; meticulously cleaning the outside of a cup while leaving the inside filthy; maintaining whitewashed tombs that are outwardly beautiful but inwardly full of dead men's bones; loudly honoring past prophets while plotting to kill present ones who preach the same message.\" These are examples of what Whedbee describes as \"Jesus as the cynic sage.\" Comedian Eric Idle opines that Jesus is \"not particularly funny, what he's saying isn't mockable, it's very decent stuff...\"\n\nBiblical scholar F. F. Bruce finds the story of Rhoda in Acts 12:12–15 \"full of vivid humour\". When Rhoda hears the voice of Peter, miraculously released from prison, she becomes so happy that she forgets to open the door and let him in.\n\nThe Bible has inspired a multitude of art and fiction in many categories, including humor and comedy. William Shakespeare's comedy \"The Merchant of Venice\" includes elements from the Book of Daniel. Biblical references can be seen in films with Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy.\n\nModern examples include Monty Python's \"Life of Brian\", Mel Brooks \"History of the World, Part I\" and sketches by Rowan Atkinson.\n\n"}
{"id": "39210587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39210587", "title": "The Pip", "text": "The Pip\n\nThe Pip is the nickname given by radio listeners to a shortwave radio station that broadcasts on the frequency 5448 kHz by day, and 3756 kHz during the night. It broadcasts short, repeated beeps at a rate of around 50 per minute, for 24 hours per day. The beep signal is occasionally interrupted for voice messages in Russian. The Pip has been active since around 1986, when its distinctive beeping sound was first recorded by listeners.\n\nThe station is commonly referred to as \"The Pip\" among English-speaking radio listeners. In Russia, it is known as (Kaplya) \"the drop\". While its official name or callsign is not known, some of the voice transmissions begin with the code 8S1Shch (Cyrillic: ), which is generally considered to be the name of the station. However, this code may not be a callsign, but instead serve some other purpose.\nRadioscanner.ru identifies the owner of this station as a North-Caucasian military district communication center with callsign \"Akacia\" (ex-72nd communication center, Russian \"72 узел связи штаба СКВО\")\n\nThe station's format resembles, in many ways, that of its presumed sister station, The Buzzer. Its signal consists of short beeping sounds that repeat at a rate of approximately 50 beeps per minute. It is transmitted on the frequency 5448 kHz during the day and 3756 kHz at night. The times at which the station switches from the day to the night frequency or vice versa are changed over the course of the year, presumably to match the changing lengths of day and night. Higher frequencies have better propagation characteristics during the day, while lower frequencies do better in darkness.\n\nAs with The Buzzer, the beeps are sometimes interrupted for the transmission of coded voice messages. There are two different message formats. Messages beginning with the Russian word (dlya, \"for\") are thought to be test messages to gauge reception quality. The message itself consists of ten callsigns, each consisting of four numbers or letters. For example:\nThis is then followed with another \"To\" and then the callsigns are repeated again, concluding with (Kak slyshno?, \"How do you hear?\"). The callsigns are then repeated twice more, ending with (Priyom!, \"Over!\").\nAnother type of message begins with (8S1Shch), thought to be the station's own callsign. This is then followed by two digits, then three, a codeword in Russian, then four pairs of digits:\nThe message is then repeated four more times, also finishing with (Priyom!, \"Over!\").\n\nThe purpose of The Pip is not known, although there are many hypotheses. It is often suggested that The Pip is part of a larger radio relay or control system, which also includes The Buzzer and The Squeaky Wheel, which both follow similar formats. In particular, activity on The Pip often used to be followed a few minutes later by a voice message on The Squeaky Wheel, suggesting that both are operated by the same organization and share the same purpose. On one occasion, The Pip's characteristic beeping sound could be heard in the background while a message was being transmitted on the Squeaky Wheel's frequency, which may indicate that both stations are even operated from within the same building or room. However, these activities have since ceased. Later tables of received messages no longer show such parallels.\n\n\n"}
