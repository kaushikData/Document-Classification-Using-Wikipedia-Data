{"id": "25247887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25247887", "title": "13 Reasons Why", "text": "13 Reasons Why\n\n13 Reasons Why (stylized onscreen as TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY) is an American teen drama web television series developed for Netflix by Brian Yorkey, based on the 2007 novel \"Thirteen Reasons Why\" by Jay Asher. The series revolves around seventeen-year-old high school student, Clay Jensen, and his deceased friend Hannah Baker, who has killed herself after having to face a culture of gossip and sexual assault at her high school and a lack of support from her friends and her school. A box of cassette tapes recorded by Hannah in the lead up to her suicide detail thirteen reasons why she ended her life. The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, Anonymous Content and Paramount Television, with Yorkey and Diana Son serving as showrunners.\n\nDylan Minnette stars as Clay, while Katherine Langford plays Hannah. Christian Navarro, Alisha Boe, Brandon Flynn, Justin Prentice, Miles Heizer, Ross Butler, Devin Druid, Amy Hargreaves, Derek Luke, Kate Walsh, and Brian d'Arcy James also star. A film from Universal Pictures based on \"Thirteen Reasons Why\" began development in February 2011, with Selena Gomez set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering the show straight to series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer.\n\nThe first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama Series. However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape, along with other mature content prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes.\n\nIn May 2017, Netflix renewed \"13 Reasons Why\" for a second season; filming began the next month and concluded that December. The second season was released on May 18, 2018, and received negative reviews from critics and mixed reviews from audiences. A third season was ordered in June 2018 and is set to be released in 2019. Critical and audience reaction to the series has been divided, with the program generating controversy between audiences and industry reviewers.\n\nIn season one, seventeen year old Clay Jensen returns home from school one day to find a mysterious box on his porch. Inside he discovers seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, his deceased classmate and unrequited love, who killed herself two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies.\n\nIn season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who present in court at trial. \n\nClay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavors to expose the corrupted culture of the High School and its favor of wealthy, sports savvy male students over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah.\n\nThroughout season two, Clay appears to be communicating with the ghost of Hannah as a plot narrative device.\n\n\n\n\nUniversal Studios purchased film rights to the novel on February 8, 2011, with Selena Gomez cast to play Hannah Baker. On October 29, 2015, it was announced that Netflix would be making a television adaptation of the book with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. Tom McCarthy was hired to direct the first two episodes. The series is produced by Anonymous Content and Paramount Television with Gomez, McCarthy, Joy Gorman, Michael Sugar, Steve Golin, Mandy Teefey, and Kristel Laiblin serving as executive producers.\n\nFilming for the show took place in the Northern Californian towns of Vallejo, Benicia, San Rafael, Crockett and Sebastopol during the summer of 2016. The 13-episode first season and the special were released on Netflix on March 31, 2017.\n\nTherapy dogs were present on set for the actors because of the intense and emotional content of the series.\n\nOn May 7, 2017, it was announced that Netflix had renewed the series for a second season. Filming for the second season began on June 12, 2017, but was briefly halted in October in response to the then-ongoing Northern California wildfires happening around the areas where the series was being filmed. Production on the second season wrapped in December 2017. The second season was released on May 18, 2018.\n\nOn June 6, 2018, Netflix renewed the series for a third season, which is set to be released in 2019.\n\nThe marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the first season was the second-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 48% of the viewers that the second season of \"Daredevil\" received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpshot. The series also showed an 18% increase in week-over-week viewership from week one to week two. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.\n\nThe first season has received positive reviews from critics, with much of the praise for the show being aimed at its acting, directing, story, visuals, improvements upon its source material, and mature approach to dark and adult subject matter. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 80% approval rating with an average rating of 7.2/10, based on 51 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"13 Reasons Why\" complements its bestselling source material with a gripping look at adolescent grief whose narrative maturity belies its YA milieu.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 76 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating generally favorable reviews.\n\nJesse Schedeen of IGN praised \"13 Reasons Why\", giving it a 9.2 out of 10, \"Amazing\", stating that the show is \"a very powerful and hard-hitting series\" and \"ranks among the best high school dramas of the 21st century\". Matthew Gilbert of \"The Boston Globe\" gave a glowing review for the show, saying, \"The drama is sensitive, consistently engaging, and, most importantly, unblinking.\" Maureen Ryan of \"Variety\" asserts that the show \"is undoubtedly sincere, but it's also, in many important ways, creatively successful\" and called it \"simply essential viewing\". Leah Greenblatt of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the entire season a score of B+, calling the show \"a frank, authentically affecting portrait of what it feels like to be young, lost and too fragile for the world\". Daniel Feinberg of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" also praised the show, calling it \"an honorably mature piece of young-adult adaptation\", and citing its performances, direction, relevance and maturity as some of the show's strongest points.\n\nThe acting, particularly Katherine Langford as Hannah and Dylan Minnette as Clay, was frequently mentioned and widely lauded in several reviews. Schedeen of IGN praised the cast, particularly Minnette and Langford, stating: \"Langford shines in the lead role... [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well. Minnette's Clay is, by design, a much more stoic and reserved character... and does a fine job in what's often a difficult role.\" Gilbert of \"The Boston Globe\" praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying that \"watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure\", while Schedeen of IGN also agreed, saying that they are \"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another\". Feinberg of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" also praises both actors: \"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic range, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in differentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to red-eyed, hygiene-starved despair.\"\n\nRyan of \"Variety\" also gave praise to not only the two leads, but also the supporting cast of actors, particularly Kate Walsh's performance as Hannah's mother, which Ryan describes as \"career-best work\". Positive mentions from various critics, such as Ryan, Feinberg and Schedeen, were also given to the supporting cast of actors (most particularly Alisha Boe, Miles Heizer and Christian Navarro's respective performances of Jessica, Alex and Tony). Liz Shannon Miller of \"Indiewire\", who enjoyed the show and gave it a positive score of B+, gave praise to the racial, gender and complex diversity of its supporting cast of teens.\n\nAnother aspect frequently mentioned within reviews was the show's mature and emotional approach to its dark and adult subject matter. This was favorably reviewed by critics, such as Miller of \"Indiewire\", particularly her statement that \"the adult edges to this story ring with honesty and truth.\" Miller, and Feinberg of \"The Hollywood Reporter\", also stated that the show can be difficult to watch at times, while Schedeen of IGN states that it is \"an often depressing and even uncomfortable show to watch... a pretty emotionally draining experience, particularly towards the end as the pieces really start to fall into place.\"\n\nNumerous critics also praised several other aspects of the show. Feinberg highlighted the show's directors, saying: \"A Sundance-friendly gallery of directors including Tom McCarthy, Gregg Araki and Carl Franklin keeps the performances grounded and the extremes from feeling exploitative\", while Gilbert of \"The Boston Globe\" praised the storytelling: \"The storytelling techniques are powerful... [as it] builds on the world established in the previous hour, as we continually encounter new facets of Hannah's life and new characters. The background on the show keeps getting deeper, richer.\"\n\nConversely, the series has also received criticism over its portrayal of teen angst. Mike Hale of \"The New York Times\" wrote a critical review, writing, \"the show doesn't make [Hannah's] downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a very long public service announcement.\" He also criticized the plot device that has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting like the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: \"It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's antagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already.\"\n\nWriting for \"The Guardian\", Rebecca Nicholson praised some aspects of the show, including the performances from Minnette and Walsh, but was troubled by much of the plot, writing, \"a storyline that suggests the love of a sweet boy might have sorted all this out added to an uneasy feeling that stayed with me\". Nicholson was skeptical that the show would appeal to older viewers, unlike other series set in high school such as \"Freaks and Geeks\" and \"My So-Called Life\": \"It lacks the crossover wit of its forebears... It's too tied up in conveying the message that terrible behaviour can have horrible consequences to deal in any subtleties or shades of feeling. It's largely one-note – and that note is horrifying. 'It has to get better,' implores one student towards the end, but given its fairly open ending, an apparent season two setup, it does not seem as if there's much chance of that happening.\"\n\n\"Washington Post\" television critic Hank Stuever wrote a negative review, finding \"13 Reasons Why\" \"contrived\" and implausible: \"There are 13 episodes lasting 13 super-sullen hours – a passive-aggressive, implausibly meandering, poorly written and awkwardly acted effort that is mainly about miscommunication, delivering no more wisdom or insight about depression, bullying and suicide than one of those old \"ABC Afterschool Specials\" people now mock for being so corny.\" He also wrote that he found Hannah's suicide tapes \"a protracted example of the teenager who fantasizes how everyone will react when she's gone. The story ... strikes me as remarkably, even dangerously, naive in its understanding of suicide, up to and including a gruesome, penultimate scene of Hannah opening her wrists in a bathtub.\"\n\nDavid Wiegand of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" gave the series a tepid review, saying that it was plagued by character inconsistencies, particularly Hannah. He praised Langford's \"stunning performance\" but noted, \"There are times when we simply don't believe the characters, when what they do or say isn't consistent with who we've been led to believe they are... At times, [Hannah] is self-possessed and indifferent at best to the behavior of the popular kids. At other times, though, relatively minor misperceived slights seem to send her into an emotional tailspin. No doubt, teenagers embody a constant whirl of conflicting emotions, but the script pushes the bounds of credibility here and there.\" He noted that overall, the series worked: \"The structure is gimmicky and the characters inconsistent, but there are still at least \"13 Reasons Why\" the series is worthy.\"\n\nThe second season received largely mixed to negative reviews from critics, with criticism aimed at the poor execution of its topics; many declared it unnecessary. Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 27% with an average rating of 5.5/10, based on 25 reviews. The site's critical consensus states, \"By deviating from its source material, \"13 Reasons Why\" can better explore its tenderly crafted characters; unfortunately, in the process, it loses track of what made the show so gripping in the first place.\" On Metacritic the season has an average score of 49 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nCatherine Pearson from DigitalSpy wrote a negative review, calling the season \"even more problematic\" than the first. She ends the review saying that, \"Unrelenting depression seems to shroud the season, briefly lifted only to collapse back down as the show's thirteenth episode, once again, delivers a deeply disturbing scene of suffering.\" Jordan Davidson from \"The Mighty\" wrote that he \"felt sick\" after watching the final episode of the season.\n\nA scene in which the character Tyler is attacked and sexually assaulted during the finale also caused controversy from fans and critics of the series, with some describing it as \"unnecessary\" and \"traumatizing\". The series' showrunner has defended the scene, saying that it was included in an attempt to \"[tell] truthful stories about things that young people go through in as unflinching a way as we can\".\n\nThe series has generated controversy over its portrayal of suicide and self-harm, prompting Netflix to add strong advisory warnings prior to the first, twelfth, and thirteenth episodes. School psychologists and educators expressed concern about the series.\n\nThe superintendent of Palm Beach County, Florida schools reportedly told parents that their schools had seen an increase in suicidal and self-harming behavior from students, and that some of those students \"have articulated associations of their at-risk behavior to the \"13 Reasons Why\" Netflix series\".\n\nThe Australian youth mental health service for 12–25 year-olds, Headspace, issued a warning in late April 2017 over the graphic content featured in the series, due to the increased number of calls to the service following the show's release in the country. Netflix however, demonstrably complied with the Australian viewer ratings system, by branding the series as \"MA15+\" when streamed via its own interface. They accompanied its presentation with additional warnings and viewer advice, and ensured that counselling referrals were included and not easily skipped at the conclusion of each episode, even including an Australian accent in the voice over for those referrals every fifth episode.\n\nIn response to the graphic nature of the show and New Zealand's high youth suicide rate, which was the highest among the 34 OECD countries during 2009 to 2012, the Office of Film & Literature Classification in the country created a new rating, \"RP18\", allowing individuals aged 18 and over to watch the series alone and those below having to watch it with supervision from a parent or guardian.\n\nIn April 2017, the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) in the United States released a statement regarding the series, saying: \"Research shows that exposure to another person's suicide, or to graphic or sensationalized accounts of death, can be one of the many risk factors that youth struggling with mental health conditions cite as a reason they contemplate or attempt suicide.\" NASP sent a letter to school mental health professionals across the country about the series, reportedly a first for NASP in response to a television show. The following month, the United States Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology (SCCAP) released a statement also noting how strongly the show may serve as a trigger for self-injury among vulnerable youth. They lamented the depiction of mental health professionals as ineffective for youth who have experienced trauma and may have been considering suicide. The statement implored Netflix to add a tag following each episode with mental health resources, and a reminder that depression and suicide can be effectively treated by a qualified mental health professional, such as a clinical child psychologist, using evidence-based practice.\n\nSimilarly, clinical psychologists such as Daniel J. Reidenberg and Erika Martinez, as well as mental health advocate MollyKate Cline of \"Teen Vogue\" magazine, have expressed concerns regarding the risk of suicide contagion. However, Eric Beeson, a counselor at The Family Institute at Northwestern University noted that \"it's unlikely that one show alone could trigger someone to attempt suicide.\" Mental health professionals have also criticized the series' depiction of suicide itself, much of which violates widely promulgated recommendations for reporting on actual suicides or not depicting them in fiction, in order to not encourage copycat suicides. The season finale, which depicts Hannah's suicide in graphic detail, has been particularly criticized in this regard. Nic Sheff, a writer for the show, has defended it as intended to dispel the myth that suicides \"quietly drift off\", and recalled how he himself was deterred from a suicide attempt by recalling a survivor's account of how painful and horrifying it was.\n\nThe NASP statement also criticized the show's suggestion that bullying alone led Hannah to take her life, noting that while it may be a contributing factor, suicidal ideations far more often result from the bullied person having a treatable mental illness without adequate coping mechanisms. Alex Moen, a school counselor in Minneapolis, took issue with the show's entire plotline as \"...essentially a fantasy of what someone who is considering suicide might have—that once you commit suicide, you can still communicate with your loved ones, and people will suddenly realize everything that you were going through and the depth of your pain ... That the cute, sensitive boy will fall in love with you and seek justice for you, and you'll be able to orchestrate it, and in so doing kind of still be able to live.\" Other counselors criticized the depiction of Hannah's attempt to reach out to Mr. Porter as dangerously misleading, since not only does he miss obvious signs of her suicidal ideations, but says he cannot report her sexual assault to the police without her identifying the assailant. School counselors are often portrayed as ineffective or clueless in popular culture, Moen says, but Porter's behavior in the series goes beyond that, to being unethical and possibly illegal. \"It's ridiculous! Counselors are not police. We don't have to launch an investigation. We bring whatever information we do have to the police\", she told \"Slate\".\n\nIn May 2017, the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) along with the Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) released a statement with similar concerns to the ones raised by NASP. CMHA believed that the series may glamorize suicide, and that some content may lead to distress in viewers, particularly in younger viewers. Furthermore, the portrayal of Hannah's suicide does not follow the media guidelines as set out by the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) and the American Association of Suicidology. CMHA and CASP did praise the show for raising awareness about \"...this preventable health concern,\" adding that, \"Raising awareness needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner. A large and growing body of Canadian and international research has found clear links between increases in suicide rates and harmful media portrayals of suicide.\" Ways in which the portrayals of suicide may cause harm, according to CMHA and CASP, include the following: \"They may simplify suicide, such as, by suggesting that bullying alone is the cause; they may make suicide seem romantic, such as, by putting it in the context of a Hollywood plot line; they may portray suicide as a logical or viable option; they may display graphic representations of suicide which may be harmful to viewers, especially young ones; and/or they may advance the false notion that suicides are a way to teach others a lesson.\"\n\nOne study found the release of \"13 Reasons Why\" corresponded with between 900,000 and 1,500,000 more suicide-related searches in the United States, including a 26% increase in searches for \"how to commit suicide,\" an 18% increase for \"commit suicide,\" and a 9% increase for \"how to kill yourself.\" A review, however, found that it is unclear if searching for information about suicide on the Internet relates to the risk of suicide.\n\nWith the release of the first season of the series, Netflix also released \"13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons\", an aftershow documentary television film. The 29-minute documentary featured cast and crew of the series, and mental health professionals discussing their experiences working on the show and dealing with difficult issues, including bullying, depression and sexual assault. A second \"Beyond the Reasons\" special was released with the second season of the series.\n\n"}

Featuring performances from Corey Cott, Lesli Margherita, Nic Rouleau, and others, the performance followed the format of the book, telling the story of a working New York actor, from college to working on Broadway, and beyond. Later iterations of the concert were performed with new cast members on February 7, 2015, and July 27, 2015.\n\nIn November 2013, AnnoyingActorFriend.com released a portion of \"#SOBLESSED\" that featured the history of Broadway touring productions, and the recent decline in salary and working conditions suffered by touring actors, due to tiered production contracts and the new Short Arrangement Touring Agreement (SETA). The following month, audition notices were posted for the national tours of Kinky Boots (musical) and Newsies (musical), which confirmed rumors that the tours were going to be going out on Tier C and Tier D production contracts, which dictate a significantly reduced salary for touring actors, in comparison to their Broadway counterparts. Through its web site, Annoying Actor Friend encouraged Actor's Equity Association (AEA) union members to band together in order to prevent the further decline of their working conditions and salaries. By January, Annoying Actor Friend had garnered enough attention that AEA council members announced that they would devote an entire member meeting to the subject of touring contracts, and \"The New York Times\" ran an article on the state of Broadway touring productions citing Annoying Actor Friend's contribution to igniting the movement.\n\nShortly after Joan Rivers died on September 4, 2014, The Broadway League announced that they would not dim Broadway's marquees to honor the famous comedian, actress, and Broadway supporter. On September 8, Annoying Actor Friend created the hashtag #Dim4Joan, urging fellow tweeters to use the hashtag as a means of convincing the Broadway League to change its mind. The hashtag rapidly reached trending status. Beginning with Jordan Roth, theatre owners began to announce that they would dim their marquees on September 9, at 6:45 PM. The League ultimately released an official statement saying that all Broadway theaters would dim their marquees to honor Rivers. A similar movement, #Dim4Kyle, occurred in August 2015, following the premature death of Kyle Jean-Baptiste, who made history on July 23, 2015 as the first African-American and youngest actor to play Jean Valjean in \"Les Miserables\" on Broadway.\n\nCreated to honor contributions made to the Broadway community that are not recognized by the Tony Awards, the first annual Awaresie Awards ceremony was released online via YouTube on June 1, 2015, and featured many of Annoying Actor Friend's frequent collaborators, such as Krysta Rodriguez and Megan Hilty, as presenters.\n\nIn 2014, Annoying Actor Friend wrote a monthly column for \"Backstage\" called \"The Working Actor.\" \n\nOn October 1, 2014, Annoying Actor Friend announced the addition of an intern personality, known as @Blessedterns, to his/her brand.

{"id": "11752874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11752874", "title": "Cancellation (television)", "text": "Cancellation (television)\n\nIn television, cancellation refers to the termination of a program by a network, typically because of low viewership, financial losses, or unfavourable critical reviews. Other potential reasons for canceling television programs include controversies involving the program's cast, conflicts among the show's staff members or to make room for new programming.\n\nShows whose runs end due to a mutual creative decision by its creators, producers, cast, and the network it airs on (such as \"Seinfeld\", \"The Sopranos\", or \"The Cosby Show\") are not considered to be \"cancelled\" but rather \"concluded\" or \"ended\", with a special last episode called its series finale. Even so, programs that end their runs in this manner are sometimes incorrectly stated to have been cancelled, even if the program was renewed for a final season (such as with \"American Idol\", by which the term was incorrectly applied upon the announcement of Fox, Fremantle Media and 19 Entertainment's decision to renew the show for a 15th and final season in May 2015 to air in 2016); shows that are cancelled traditionally end their runs during the television season in which the program airs first-run episodes at the time, either effective immediately after the announcement is made by the network or until all remaining episodes are broadcast.\n\nThe Friday night death slot is a perceived graveyard slot in American television, referring to the idea that a television program in the United States scheduled on Friday evenings is destined for imminent cancellation.\n\nCommercial television is supported by advertising, or viewers paying for TV-channels. Viewing figures are collected by audience measurement ratings agencies (such as Nielsen in the United States), and the programs with the highest viewing figures command a higher advertising fee for the network. As such, shows with a low viewership are generally not as profitable. For most United States networks, the number of viewers within the 18–49 age range is more important than the total number of viewers. According to \"Advertising Age\", during the 2007–08 season, \"Grey's Anatomy\" was able to charge $419,000 per television commercial, compared to only $248,000 for a commercial during \"\", despite CSI having almost five million more viewers on average. Due to its strength in young demographics, \"Friends\" was able to charge almost three times as much for a commercial as \"Murder, She Wrote\", even though the two television series had similar total viewer numbers during the seasons they were on the air together. (A slight exception to this is CBS, whose self-stated target audience is persons 25 to 54 years old; because of this, CBS programs tend to favor slightly older audiences than their broadcast rivals.)\n\nOther factors are considered as well, such as the cost to produce the show. For example, a game show costs less money to produce than a science fiction program, so even if the game show has lesser ratings it may survive cancellation because of the higher profit margin. Game shows and self-contained reality shows, which can be produced on short order with very little preparation compared to scripted series and annual contests, may not be canceled in the same way, but merely have the network cease ordering episodes and end up in limbo; in turn, these types of shows are also easily brought back if a network needs to produce filler programming quickly (as was the case with \"Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?\", which was renewed more than three years after it had produced its last episode because of a programming shortage on Fox). Whether the show is produced by the network or an outside company can also factor into a show's future; networks, especially in the 21st century, tend to prefer shows that are produced in-house, as they can take advantage of vertical integration and, in addition to making money from the first run of the show on the network, continue to profit from syndicating the reruns. Thus, if two shows have similar ratings and expenses but one is produced by the network while the other is held by an outside company, the outsider program is more likely to be canceled. This was not an issue in the late 20th century, when Financial Interest and Syndication Rules prohibited American networks from owning syndicators.\n\nVery rarely are television programs cancelled for reasons other than ratings or profitability. Notable cases are \"Turn-On\" and \"Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos\", which were canceled after viewer and station outrage; \"Bridget Loves Bernie\", which was forced off the air despite high ratings because of threats of violence from Jewish radicals; \"Roseanne\", which was canceled despite extremely strong ratings over objections to title star Roseanne Barr's social media comments; \"Home Run Derby\", which was canceled due to the host's death; and \"Megan Wants a Millionaire\", which was canceled in August 2009 following the arrest warrant (and later, suicide) of one of the finalists.\n\nOccasionally, a show may be brought back into production after being previously cancelled. Such was the case with \"Unforgettable\", a CBS crime drama that was canceled in 2012, but was revived in the summer of 2013. Sometimes, one network may decide to air a series previously cancelled by another network. For example, \"Family Matters\" and \"Step by Step\" both moved from ABC to CBS in its ninth and final season of production. This is an uncommon occurrence, and few programs have successfully made audience gains when changing networks.\n\nIn other cases, overwhelming fan response may lead to a show's revival. The original series of \"\" was given an additional season after a letter-writing campaign from fans. Another successful letter-writing campaign helped revive \"Cagney & Lacey\". In 2007, \"Jericho\" was given an additional seven-episode order after fans mailed thousands of pounds of nuts to network executives (a reference to a pivotal line in the season finale).\n\nStrong home video sales and viewership on cable have also helped revive a series. \"Firefly\" and \"Police Squad!\" were revived in the form of theatrical films (an uncommon occurrence, since failed television series are usually not considered bankable movie material), \"Family Guy\" was returned to Fox, and \"Futurama\" (the volume 5 DVD cover touts the tag line \"back by popular harassment!\") returned in the form of straight to video films and a subsequent series of new television episodes for Comedy Central (although Comedy Central would later cancel the show itself). \"Arrested Development\" was revived for a fourth season in 2013 (seven years after being canceled by Fox) as a Netflix Original Series, after episodes of its initial run proved popular on the streaming service.\n\nIn some situations, a television series may be revived years after being cancelled. Often this is in the form of a spin-off show featuring new characters (such as \"\" which premiered eighteen years after the original series went off the air). \"Doctor Who\", which was cancelled by the BBC in 1989, was brought back in 2005 as a continuation of the original run of shows. Both franchises also produced spin-off films in the periods they were cancelled. This approach has seen increased exposure in the 2010s, with shows such as \"Girl Meets World\" (a follow-up to \"Boy Meets World\"), \"Fuller House\" (a follow-up to \"Full House\"), \"Will & Grace\" and \"Roseanne \" all returning to television approximately a full generation after the original series aired.\n\n\n\n"}

According to Bernhard Paul, the name was inspired by a film script of his fellow Austrian Peter Hajek, \"Sarah Roncalli, Tochter des Mondes\" (\"Sarah Roncalli, daughter of the moon\", sometimes also cited as \"widow of the moon\"). The reminiscence to the popular Pope John XXIII (1881–1963), whose legal name was \"Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli\", served as a key to the success.\n\nThe first performance of the circus was on 18 May 1976 on the \"Hofgartenwiese\" in Bonn, and the tour finished on 16 August 1976 in Munich. After the first season, Paul and Heller disagreed about the concept and rights, so that at a future performance on 4 June 1980 in Cologne, Bernhard Paul directed the circus on his own. (In September 1976 there were already performances without Heller in Vienna, but the show closed after a short run owing to a dwindling audience.) Since then, the circus has toured in Germany and abroad, including the first appearance of a West German circus in the Soviet Union in 1986. Model-turned-photographer Ellen von Unwerth worked as an assistant at Circus Roncalli in Munich for around a month when she was eighteen years old.\n\nThe winter quarters of the circus have been at Neurather Weg 7 in Mülheim, Cologne since 1984.

{"id": "397310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=397310", "title": "Dogville", "text": "Dogville\n\nDogville is a 2003 internationally co-produced avant-garde crime revenge tragedy film written and directed by Lars von Trier, and starring an ensemble cast led by Nicole Kidman, Lauren Bacall, Paul Bettany, Chloë Sevigny, Stellan Skarsgård, Udo Kier, Ben Gazzara, and James Caan. It is a parable that uses an extremely minimal, stage-like set to tell the story of Grace Mulligan (Kidman), a woman hiding from mobsters, who arrives in the small mountain town of Dogville, Colorado, and is provided refuge in return for physical labor.\n\nThe film is the first in von Trier's projected \"USA – Land of Opportunities\" trilogy, which was followed by \"Manderlay\" (2005) and is projected to be completed with \"Wasington\" (sic). The film was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival but Gus Van Sant's \"Elephant\" won the award. It was screened at various film festivals before receiving a limited release in the US on March 26, 2004.\n\n\"Dogville\" opened to polarized reviews from critics. Some considered it to be pretentious or exasperating; it was viewed by others as a masterpiece, and has grown in stature since its initial release.\n\nThe story of \"Dogville\" is told in nine chapters and a prologue, with a one-sentence description of each chapter given in the film, in the vein of such chapter headings in many 19th-century novels. These descriptions are given below.\n\nDogville is a very small American town by an abandoned silver mine in the Rocky Mountains, with a road leading up to it and nowhere else to go but the mountains. The film begins with a prologue in which a dozen or so of the fifteen citizens are introduced. They are portrayed as lovable, good people with small flaws which are easy to forgive.\n\nThe town is seen from the point of view of Tom Edison Jr., an aspiring writer who procrastinates by trying to get his fellow citizens together for regular meetings on the subject of \"moral rearmament\". It is clear that Tom wants to succeed his aging father, a physician, as the moral and spiritual leader of the town.\n\nIt is Tom who first meets Grace Mulligan, who is on the run from gangsters who presumably shot at her. Grace, a beautiful but modest woman, wishes to keep running, but Tom assures her that the mountains ahead are too difficult to pass. As they talk, the gangsters approach the town, and Tom quickly hides Grace in the nearby mine. One of the gangsters asks Tom if he has seen the woman, which he denies. The gangster then offers him a reward and hands him a card with a phone number to call in case Grace shows up.\n\nTom decides to use Grace as an \"illustration\" in his next meeting—a way for the townspeople to prove that they are indeed committed to community values, can receive a gift, and are willing to help the stranger. They remain skeptical, so Tom proposes that Grace should be given a chance to prove that she is a good person. Grace is accepted for two weeks in which, as Tom explains to her after the meeting, she must gain the friendship and trust of the townspeople.\n\nOn Tom's suggestion, Grace offers to do chores for the citizens—talking to the lonely, blind Jack McKay, helping to run the small shop, looking after the children of Chuck and Vera, and so forth. After some initial reluctance, the people accept her help in doing those chores that \"nobody really needs\" but which nevertheless make their lives easier. As a result, she becomes an accepted part of the community.\n\nIn tacit agreement Grace is expected to continue her chores, which she does gladly, and is even paid small wages which she saves up to purchase a set of seven expensive porcelain figurines, one at a time, from Ma Ginger's shop. Grace begins to make friends, including Jack, who pretends that he is not blind. She earns his respect upon tricking him into admitting that he is blind. Once the two weeks are over, everyone votes at the town meeting that Grace should be allowed to stay.\n\nThings go well in Dogville until the police arrive to place a \"Missing\" poster featuring Grace's picture and name on the mission house. With the townspeople divided as to whether they should cooperate with the police, the mood of the community darkens somewhat.\n\nStill, things continue as usual until the 4th of July celebrations. After Tom awkwardly admits his love to Grace which she reciprocates and the whole town expresses their agreement that it has become a better place thanks to her, the police arrive again to replace the \"Missing\" poster with a \"Wanted\" poster. Grace is now wanted for participation in a bank robbery. Everyone agrees that she must be innocent, since at the time the robbery took place, she was doing chores for the townspeople every day.\n\nNevertheless, Tom argues that because of the increased risk to the town now that they are harboring someone who is wanted as a criminal, Grace should provide a quid pro quo and do more chores for the townspeople within the same time, for less pay. At this point, what was previously a voluntary arrangement takes on a slightly coercive nature as Grace is clearly uncomfortable with the idea. Still, being very amenable and wanting to please Tom, Grace agrees.\n\nAt this point the situation worsens, as with her additional workload, Grace inevitably makes mistakes, and the people she works for seem to be equally irritated by the new schedule—and take it out on Grace. The situation slowly escalates, with the male citizens making small sexual advances to Grace and the females becoming increasingly abusive. Even the children are perverse: Jason, the 10-year-old son of Chuck and Vera, asks Grace to spank him, until she finally complies after much provocation (von Trier has noted that this is the first point in the film where it is clear how completely Grace's lack of social status and choices makes her vulnerable to other people manipulating her). The hostility towards Grace finally reaches a turning point as well when Chuck rapes her in his home.\n\nThat evening, Grace tells Tom what had happened and he starts to form a plan for her escape. The next day, Vera confronts Grace for spanking her son Jason and Liz informs her that a few people saw Tom leave her shack very late the night before, casting suspicions on her virtue. The next evening she is confronted again by Vera, Liz and Martha in her shack. Martha witnessed a sexual encounter between Chuck and her in the apple orchard. Vera blames her for seducing her husband and decides to punish Grace by destroying the figurines. Grace begs her to spare them and tries to remind Vera of all the good things she has done for her including teaching her children the philosophy of stoicism. Vera cruelly uses it against her while destroying the figurines she worked hard for. Grace goes to Tom that evening and they decide to bribe the freight truck driver Ben to smuggle her out of town in his truck. En route, she is raped by Ben, after which the truck lumbers only to return Grace to Dogville.\n\nThe town agrees that they must not let her escape again. The money paid to Ben to help Grace escape had been stolen by Tom from his father—but when Grace is blamed for the theft, Tom refuses to admit he did it because, as he explains, this is the only way he can still protect Grace without people getting suspicious. So Grace finally becomes a slave: she is chained, repeatedly raped, and abused by the people of the town. She is also humiliated by the children who ring the church bell every time she is violated, much to Tom's disgust.\n\nThis culminates in a late night general assembly in which Grace—following Tom's suggestion—relates calmly all that she has endured from everyone in town, then heads back to her shack. Embarrassed and in complete denial, the townspeople finally decide to get rid of her. As Tom tells Grace this, declaring his allegiance to her over the town, he attempts to make love to her. Still chained, she responds to his advances by saying \"...lt would be so beautiful, but from the point of view of our love so completely wrong. We were to meet in freedom.\" She questions if thoughts of using force against her are in fact why he is so upset, noting that he could have her if he wants—all he needs to do is threaten her to get his way, as the others have done. Tom defends his intentions as pure, but upon reflection realizes that what she says is true. Shaken by self-doubt, he decides it would jeopardize his career as a philosopher if this doubt were allowed to grow. To rid himself of its source, he decides to personally call the mobsters and turn Grace over.\n\nWhen the mobsters finally arrive, they are welcomed cordially by Tom and an impromptu committee of other townspeople. Grace is then freed by the indignant henchmen, and her true identity is revealed: she is the daughter of a powerful gang leader who ran away because she could not stand his dirty work. Her father motions her into his Cadillac and argues with her about issues of morality. After some introspection, Grace reverses herself and comes to the conclusion that Dogville's crimes cannot be excused due to the difficulty of their circumstances. Tom, who has become aware that the mobsters pose a threat to himself and the town, is momentarily remorseful, but rapidly descends into rationalization for his actions. Grace sadly return to her father's car, accepts his power, and uses it to command that Dogville be removed from the earth.\n\nGrace tells the gangsters to make Vera watch her children die, as punishment for destroying her figurines. Dogville is burned to the ground and all of its inhabitants brutally massacred with the exception of Tom, whom she executes personally with a revolver right after he applauds the effectiveness of her use of illustration as an attempt to get her to spare him. After the massacre, the gangsters hear a barking sound from one of the houses. It is the dog Moses. A gangster aims a gun at the dog, but Grace commands that it should live: \"He's just angry because I once took his bone.\" The chalk drawing of Moses becomes a real dog as his barks lead into the credits.\n\n\"Dogville: The Pilot\" was shot during 2001 in the pre-production phase to test whether the concept of chalk lines and sparse scenery would work. The 15-minute pilot film starred Danish actors Sidse Babett Knudsen (as Grace) and Nikolaj Lie Kaas (as Tom). Eventually Lars von Trier was happy with the overall results. As a result, he and the producers decided to move forward with the production of the feature film. The test pilot was never shown in public, but is featured on the second disc of the \"Dogville\" (2003) DVD, released in November 2003.\n\nThe story of \"Dogville\" is narrated by John Hurt in nine chapters and takes place on a stage with minimalist scenery. Some walls and furniture are placed on the stage, but the rest of the scenery exists merely as white painted outlines which have big labels on them; for example, the outlines of gooseberry bushes have the text \"Gooseberry Bushes\" written next to them. While this form of staging is common in black box theaters, it has rarely been attempted on film before—the Western musical \"Red Garters\" (1954) and \"Vanya on 42nd Street\" (1994) being notable exceptions. The bare staging serves to focus the audience's attention on the acting and storytelling, and also reminds them of the film's artificiality. As such it is heavily influenced by the theatre of Bertolt Brecht. (There are also similarities between the song \"Seeräuberjenny\" (\"Pirate Jenny\") in Brecht and Kurt Weill's \"Die Dreigroschenoper\" (\"The Threepenny Opera\") and the story of Dogville. Chico Buarque's version of this song, Geni e o Zepelim [\"Geni and the Zeppelin\"], deals with the more erotic aspects of abjection and bears striking similarity to von Trier's cinematic homage to the song.) The film does however employ carefully designed lighting to suggest natural effects such as the moving shadows of clouds, and sound effects are used to create the presence of non-existent set pieces (e.g., there are no doors, but the doors can always be heard when an actor \"opens\" or \"closes\" one).\n\nThe film was shot on high-definition video using a Sony HDW-F900 camera in a studio in Trollhättan, Sweden.\n\nAccording to von Trier, the point of the film is that \"evil can arise anywhere, as long as the situation is right\".\n\nEbert and Roeper criticized \"Dogville\" as having a strongly anti-American message, citing, for example, the closing credits sequence with images of poverty-stricken Americans [taken from Jacob Holdt's documentary book \"American Pictures\" (1984)] accompanied by David Bowie's song \"Young Americans\".\n\n\"Dogville\" divided critics upon its United States theatrical release, with Metacritic giving it a score of 60 (\"Mixed or average reviews\") and the Rotten Tomatoes critics' consensus for it stating simply, \"A challenging piece of experimental filmmaking.\" Some hailed it as an innovative and powerful artistic statement, while others considered it to be an emotionally detached or even misanthropic work. In \"The Village Voice\", J. Hoberman wrote, \"For passion, originality, and sustained chutzpah, this austere allegory of failed Christian charity and Old Testament payback is von Trier's strongest movie--a masterpiece, in fact.\" Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" gave the film 3.5/4 stars, praising Kidman's performance and dubbing it \"a movie that never met a cliche it didn't stomp on.\" Scott Foundas of \"LA Weekly\" described it as a work of \"boldness, cutting insight, [and] intermittent hilarity,\" and interpreted it as \"a potent parable of human suffering.\" In \"Empire\", Alan Morrison wrote that \"\"Dogville\", in a didactic and politicised stage tradition, is a great play that shows a deep understanding of human beings as they really are.\"\n\nIn the \"Los Angeles Times\", on the other hand, Manohla Dargis dismissed it as \"three hours of tedious experimentation.\" Richard Corliss of \"TIME\" argued that von Trier lacked humanity and wrote that the director \"presumably wants us to attend to his characters' yearnings and prejudices without the distractions of period furnishings. It's a brilliant idea, for about 10 minutes. Then the bare set is elbowed out of a viewer's mind by the threadbare plot and characterizations.\" Roger Ebert, who gave it two out of four stars, felt that the film was so pedantic as to make von Trier comparable to a crank, and viewed it as \"a demonstration of how a good idea can go wrong.\" In the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\", Sean Axmaker said, \"There's no denying von Trier is visually intriguing. [...] But as an artist, his contempt for humanity is becoming harder to hide with stylistic flourish.\" Charles Taylor of \"Salon\" additionally responded to allegations of the film's anti-Americanism with the charge that it was \"anti-human\", and said that it was \"as total a misanthropic vision as anything control freak Stanley Kubrick ever turned out\"—while personally admitting that he felt von Trier was as deliberate a filmmaker as Kubrick.\n\nLater, \"Dogville\" was named one of the greatest films of its decade in \"The Guardian\", \"The List\", \"Paste\", and other publications. In 2016, it was ranked one of the 100 greatest motion pictures since 2000 in a critics' poll conducted by BBC Culture. According to aggregator \"They Shoot Pictures, Don't They\", it is the 20th most acclaimed film of the same time period.\n\nAmerican director and screenwriter Quentin Tarantino has named the film as one of the 20 best to have been released during the time of his active career as a director; he said that if it had been written for the stage, von Trier would have won a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nThe film grossed $1,535,286 in the US market and $15,145,550 from the rest of the world for a total gross of $16,680,836 worldwide. In the opening US weekend it did poorly, grossing only $88,855. The movie was released in only nine theaters, however, with an average of $9,872 per theater. In Denmark, the film grossed $1,231,984. The highest-grossing country was Italy, with $3,272,119.\n\n\"Dogville\" made many 2004 top-ten lists:\n\nThe film received nine votes (with six from critics and three from directors) in the 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" polls.\n\n\n"}

It aired Sunday nights 7:30-9:00 pm (EST) on ABC during the 1955-56 television season, switching to Saturday nights (7:30-9 pm) during its second and final season, 1956-57.\n\nIn 1955, ABC obtained the rights to broadcast 35 British movies, the rights of which were owned by English film mogul J. Arthur Rank. Titles of these included \"The Man in Grey\" (1943), \"The Lavender Hill Mob\" (1951), \"Odd Man Out\" (1947), \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" (1945), \"The Red Shoes\" (1948), and \"Hamlet\" (1948). However, many of these, such as \"Hamlet\", ran two full hours or longer, and were either drastically cut to fit a ninety-minute time slot or shown in two installments a week apart. It was not until November 3, 1956, with CBS's first presentation of MGM's \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939), that an uncut film lasting more than ninety minutes was telecast in one evening on a television network.\n\nUnfortunately, all films in this series were broadcast in black-and-white, despite the fact that several of them had been originally photographed and exhibited theatrically in color. Thus, such films as \"Stairway to Heaven\" (1946) and \"The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp\" (1943) would not be seen by American viewers in color until years later when they were released for rental and exhibition by local and independent television stations.\n\nOther British films from J. Arthur Rank Productions obtained at the same time were shown as part of ABC's daytime \"Afternoon Film Festival\", which aired weekdays from 3:00-5:00 pm (ET). This show premiered January 16, 1956 and ended August 2, 1957, replaced by \"American Bandstand\", which introduced Dick Clark to network television audiences and went on to become one of daytime's most popular programs, especially with teenagers.\n\nAll titles listed below for the series' two seasons were cited from the TV listings of \"The New York Times\" via microfilm copies of its backlogged issues, September 1955-May 1957.\n\nThe remainder of this first season consisted of reruns of the films above, some of which were repeated twice before the beginning of the second season in October 1956, when the series moved to a new night: Saturdays from 7:30 to 9:00 pm (Eastern Time).\n\n\nAfter re-running \"Tonight at 8:30\" on June 8, ABC ceased airing its \"Famous Film Festival\" series. Instead, through the summer of 1957, the network used its 7:30-9:00 time-slot on Saturdays to broadcast televised sermons by Billy Graham and then later (beginning July 6) ABC aired \"Country Music Hayride\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "100031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100031", "title": "Federico García Lorca", "text": "Federico García Lorca\n\nFederico del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús García Lorca, known as Federico García Lorca (; 5 June 1898 – 19 August 1936) was a Spanish poet, playwright, and theatre director.\n\nGarcía Lorca achieved international recognition as an emblematic member of the Generation of '27, a group consisting of mostly poets who introduced the tenets of European movements (such as symbolism, futurism, and surrealism) into Spanish literature. He was executed by Nationalist forces at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. His body has never been found. In 2008, a Spanish judge opened an investigation into Lorca's death. The García Lorca family eventually dropped objections to the excavation of a potential gravesite near Alfacar, but no human remains were found.\n\nGarcía Lorca was born on 5 June 1898, in Fuente Vaqueros, a small town a few miles west of Granada, southern Spain. His father, Federico García Rodríguez, was a prosperous landowner with a farm in the fertile \"vega\" (valley) surrounding Granada and a comfortable villa in the heart of the city. García Rodríguez saw his fortunes rise with a boom in the sugar industry. García Lorca's mother, Vicenta Lorca Romero, was a teacher. After Fuente Vaqueros, the family moved in 1905 to the nearby town of Valderrubio (at the time named Asquerosa). In 1909, when the boy was 11, his family moved to the regional capital of Granada; their best known residence there is the summer home known as the Huerta de San Vicente, on what was then the outskirts of the city of Granada. For the rest of his life, he maintained the importance of living close to the natural world, praising his upbringing in the country. All three of these homes—Fuente Vaqueros, Valderrubio, and Huerta de San Vicente—are today museums.\n\nIn 1915, after graduating from secondary school, García Lorca attended the University of Granada. During this time his studies included law, literature and composition. Throughout his adolescence he felt a deeper affinity for music than for literature. When he was 11 years old, he began six years of piano lessons with Antonio Segura Mesa, a harmony teacher in the local conservatory and a composer. It was Mesa who inspired Federico's dream of developing a career in music. His first artistic inspirations arose from the scores of Claude Debussy, Frédéric Chopin and Ludwig van Beethoven. Later, with his friendship with composer Manuel de Falla, Spanish folklore became his muse. García Lorca did not begin a career in writing until Segura died in 1916, and his first prose works such as \"Nocturne\", \"Ballade\" and \"Sonata\" drew on musical forms. His milieu of young artists gathered in El Rinconcillo at the cafe Alameda in Granada. During 1916 and 1917, García Lorca traveled throughout Castile, León, and Galicia, in northern Spain, with a professor of his university, who also encouraged him to write his first book, \"\" (\"Impressions and Landscapes\" – printed at his father's expense in 1918). Fernando de los Rios persuaded García Lorca's parents to let him move to the progressive, Oxbridge-inspired Residencia de Estudiantes in Madrid in 1919, while nominally attending classes at the University of Madrid.\n\nAt the Residencia de Estudiantes in Madrid, García Lorca befriended Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí and many other creative artists who were, or would become, influential across Spain. He was taken under the wing of the poet Juan Ramón Jiménez, becoming close to playwright Eduardo Marquina and Gregorio Martínez Sierra, the Director of Madrid's Teatro Eslava. In 1919–20, at Sierra's invitation, he wrote and staged his first play, \"The Butterfly's Evil Spell\". It was a verse play dramatising the impossible love between a cockroach and a butterfly, with a supporting cast of other insects; it was laughed off the stage by an unappreciative public after only four performances and influenced García Lorca's attitude to the theatre-going public for the rest of his career. He would later claim that \"Mariana Pineda\", written in 1927, was, in fact, his first play. During the time at the Residencia de Estudiantes, he pursued degrees in law and philosophy, though he had more interest in writing than study.\n\nGarcía Lorca's first book of poems was published in 1921, collecting work written from 1918 and selected with the help of his brother Francisco (nicknamed Paquito). They concern the themes of religious faith, isolation and nature that had filled his prose reflections. Early in 1922 at Granada García Lorca joined the composer Manuel de Falla in order to promote the Concurso de Cante Jondo, a festival dedicated to enhance flamenco performance. The year before Lorca had begun to write his \"Poema del cante jondo\" (\"Poem of the Deep Song\", not published until 1931), so he naturally composed an essay on the art of flamenco, and began to speak publicly in support of the \"Concurso\". At the music festival in June he met the celebrated Manuel Torre, a flamenco cantador. The next year in Granada he also collaborated with Falla and others on the musical production of a play for children, adapted by Lorca from an Andalucian story. Inspired by the same structural form of sequence as \"Deep song\", his collection \"Suites\" (1923) was never finished and not published until 1983.\n\nOver the next few years, García Lorca became increasingly involved in Spain's avant-garde. He published a poetry collection including \"Cancion\" (\"Song\"). Shortly after, Lorca was invited to exhibit a series of drawings at the in Barcelona, from 25 June – 2 July 1927. Lorca's sketches were a blend of popular and avant-garde styles, complementing \"Canción\". Both his poetry and drawings reflected the influence of traditional Andalusian motifs, Cubist syntax, and a preoccupation with sexual identity. Several drawings consisted of superimposed dreamlike faces (or shadows). He later described the double faces as self-portraits, showing \"man's capacity for crying as well as winning\", inline with his conviction that sorrow and joy were inseparable, just as life and death. \n\n\"Romancero Gitano\" (\"Gypsy Ballads\", 1928), part of his Cancion series, became his best known book of poetry. It was a highly stylised imitation of the ballads and poems that were still being told throughout the Spanish countryside. García Lorca describes the work as a \"carved altar piece\" of Andalusia with \"gypsies, horses, archangels, planets, its Jewish and Roman breezes, rivers, crimes, the everyday touch of the smuggler and the celestial note of the naked children of Córdoba. A book that hardly expresses visible Andalusia at all, but where the hidden Andalusia trembles\". In 1928, the book brought him fame across Spain and the Hispanic world, and it was only much later that he gained notability as a playwright. For the rest of his life, the writer would search for the elements of Andaluce culture, trying to find its essence without resorting to the \"picturesque\" or the cliched use of \"local colour\".\n\nHis second play, \"Mariana Pineda\", with stage settings by Salvador Dalí, opened to great acclaim in Barcelona in 1927. In 1926, García Lorca wrote the play \"The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife\", which would not be shown until the early 1930s. It was a farce about fantasy, based on the relationship between a flirtatious, petulant wife and a hen-pecked shoemaker.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1928, he was passionately involved with Dalí. The friendship with Lorca had a strong element of mutual passion, but Dalí rejected the erotic advances of the poet. With the success of \"Gypsy Ballads\", came an estrangement from Dalí and the breakdown of a love affair with sculptor Emilio Aladrén Perojo. These brought on an increasing depression, a situation exacerbated by his anguish over his homosexuality. He felt he was trapped between the persona of the successful author, which he was forced to maintain in public, and the tortured, authentic self, which he could acknowledge only in private. He also had the sense that he was being pigeon-holed as a \"gypsy poet\". He wrote: \"The gypsies are a theme. And nothing more. I could just as well be a poet of sewing needles or hydraulic landscapes. Besides, this gypsyism gives me the appearance of an uncultured, ignorant and primitive poet that you know very well I'm not. I don't want to be typecast\". Growing estrangement between García Lorca and his closest friends reached its climax when surrealists Dalí and Luis Buñuel collaborated on their 1929 film \"Un Chien Andalou\" (\"An Andalusian Dog\"). García Lorca interpreted it, perhaps erroneously, as a vicious attack upon himself. At this time Dalí also met his future wife Gala. Aware of these problems (though not perhaps of their causes), García Lorca's family arranged for him to take a lengthy visit to the United States in 1929–30.\n\nIn June 1929, García Lorca travelled to the US with Fernando de los Rios on the \"RMS Olympic\", a sister liner to the \"RMS Titanic\". They stayed mostly in New York City, where Rios started a lecture tour and García Lorca enrolled at Columbia University School of General Studies, funded by his parents. He studied English but, as before, was more absorbed by writing than study. He also spent time in Vermont and later in Havana, Cuba. His collection \"Poeta en Nueva York\" (\"A Poet in New York\", published posthumously in 1942) explores alienation and isolation through some graphically experimental poetic techniques and was influenced by the Wall Street crash which he personally witnessed. This condemnation of urban capitalist society and materialistic modernity was a sharp departure from his earlier work and label as a folklorist. His play of this time, \"El Público\" (\"The Public\"), was not published until the late 1970s and has never been published in its entirety, the manuscript lost. However, the Hispanic Society of America in New York City retains several of his personal letters.\n\nGarcía Lorca's return to Spain in 1930 coincided with the fall of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic. In 1931, García Lorca was appointed director of a student theatre company, Teatro Universitario La Barraca (The Shack). It was funded by the Second Republic's Ministry of Education, and it was charged with touring Spain's rural areas in order to introduce audiences to radically modern interpretations of classic Spanish theatre free of charge. With a portable stage and little equipment, they sought to bring theatre to people who had never seen any, with García Lorca directing as well as acting. He commented: \"Outside of Madrid, the theatre, which is in its very essence a part of the life of the people, is almost dead, and the people suffer accordingly, as they would if they had lost their two eyes, or ears, or a sense of taste. We [La Barraca] are going to give it back to them\". His experiences traveling through impoverished rural Spain and New York (particularly amongst the disenfranchised African American population), transformed him into a passionate advocate of the theatre of social action. He wrote \"The theatre is a school of weeping and of laughter, a free forum, where men can question norms that are outmoded or mistaken and explain with living example the eternal norms of the human heart\".\n\nWhile touring with \"La Barraca\", García Lorca wrote his now best-known plays, the \"Rural Trilogy\" of \"Blood Wedding\", \"Yerma\" and \"The House of Bernarda Alba\", which all rebelled against the norms of bourgeois Spanish society. He called for a rediscovery of the roots of European theatre and the questioning of comfortable conventions such as the popular drawing-room comedies of the time. His work challenged the accepted role of women in society and explored taboo issues of homoeroticism and class. García Lorca wrote little poetry in this last period of his life, declaring in 1936, \"theatre is poetry that rises from the book and becomes human enough to talk and shout, weep and despair.\" \n\nTravelling to Buenos Aires in 1933 to give lectures and direct the Argentine premiere of \"Blood Wedding\", García Lorca spoke of his distilled theories on artistic creation and performance in the famous lecture \"Play and Theory of the Duende\". This attempted to define a schema of artistic inspiration, arguing that great art depends upon a vivid awareness of death, connection with a nation's soil, and an acknowledgment of the limitations of reason.\n\nAs well as returning to the classical roots of theatre, García Lorca also turned to traditional forms in poetry. His last poetic work, \"Sonetos de amor oscuro\" (\"Sonnets of Dark Love\", 1936), was long thought to have been inspired by his passion for Rafael Rodríguez Rapun, secretary of La Barraca. Documents and mementos revealed in 2012 suggest that the actual inspiration was Juan Ramírez de Lucas, a 19-year-old with whom Lorca hoped to emigrate to Mexico. The love sonnets are inspired by the 16th-century poet San Juan de la Cruz. La Barraca's subsidy was cut in half by the rightist government elected in 1934, and its last performance was given in April 1936.\n\nLorca spent summers at the Huerta de San Vicente from 1926 to 1936. Here he wrote, totally or in part, some of his major works, among them \"When Five Years Pass\" (\"Así que pasen cinco años\") (1931), \"Blood Wedding\" (1932), \"Yerma\" (1934) and \"Diván del Tamarit\" (1931–1936). The poet lived in the Huerta de San Vicente in the days just before his arrest and assassination in August 1936.\n\nAlthough García Lorca's drawings do not often receive attention, he was also a talented artist.\n\nPolitical and social tensions had greatly intensified after the murder of prominent monarchist and anti-Popular Front spokesman José Calvo Sotelo by Republican Assault Guards (Guardias de Asalto). García Lorca knew that he would be suspect to the rising right-wing for his outspoken socialist views. Granada was so tumultuous that it had not had a mayor for months; no one dared accept the job. When Lorca's brother-in-law, Manuel Fernández-Montesinos, agreed to accept the position, he was assassinated within a week. On the same day he was shot, 18 August, Lorca was arrested.\n\nIt is thought that García Lorca was shot and killed by Nationalist militia on 19 August 1936. The author Ian Gibson in his book \"The Assassination of García Lorca\" alleges that he was shot with three others (Joaquín Arcollas Cabezas, Francisco Galadí Melgar and Dióscoro Galindo González) at a place known as the Fuente Grande ('Great Spring') which is on the road between Víznar and Alfacar. Police reports released by radio station Cadena SER in April 2015 conclude that Lorca was executed by fascist forces. The Franco-era report, dated 9 July 1965, describes the writer as a \"socialist\" and \"freemason belonging to the Alhambra lodge\", who engaged in \"homosexual and abnormal practices\".\n\nSignificant controversy exists about the motives and details of Lorca's murder. Personal, non-political motives have been suggested. García Lorca's biographer, Stainton, states that his killers made remarks about his sexual orientation, suggesting that it played a role in his death. Ian Gibson suggests that García Lorca's assassination was part of a campaign of mass killings intended to eliminate supporters of the Marxist Popular Front. However, Gibson proposes that rivalry between the right-wing Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) and the fascist Falange was a major factor in Lorca's death. Former CEDA Parliamentary Deputy Ramón Ruiz Alonso arrested García Lorca at the Rosales's home, and was the one responsible for the original denunciation that led to the arrest warrant being issued.\n\nIt has been argued that García Lorca was apolitical and had many friends in both Republican and Nationalist camps. Gibson disputes this in his 1978 book about the poet's death. He cites, for example, \"Mundo Obrero's\" published manifesto, which Lorca later signed, and alleges that Lorca was an active supporter of the Popular Front. Lorca read this manifesto out loud at a banquet in honour of fellow poet Rafael Alberti on 9 February 1936.\n\nMany anti-communists were sympathetic to Lorca or assisted him. In the days before his arrest he found shelter in the house of the artist and leading Falange member Luis Rosales. Indeed, evidence suggests that Rosales was very nearly shot as well by the Civil Governor Valdés for helping García Lorca. Poet Gabriel Celaya wrote in his memoirs that he once found García Lorca in the company of Falangist José Maria Aizpurua. Celaya further wrote that Lorca dined every Friday with Falangist founder and leader José Antonio Primo de Rivera. On 11 March 1937 an article appeared in the Falangist press denouncing the murder and lionizing García Lorca; the article opened: \"The finest poet of Imperial Spain has been assassinated.\" Jean-Louis Schonberg also put forward the 'homosexual jealousy' theory. The dossier on the murder, compiled at Franco's request and referred to by Gibson and others, has yet to surface. The first published account of an attempt to locate Lorca's grave can be found in British traveller and Hispanist Gerald Brenan's book \"The Face of Spain\". Despite early attempts such as Brenan's in 1949, the site remained undiscovered throughout the Franco era.\n\nIn late October 2009, a team of archaeologists and historians from the University of Granada began excavations outside Alfacar. The site was identified three decades previously by a man who claimed to have helped dig Lorca's grave. Lorca was thought to be buried with at least three other men beside a winding mountain road that connects the villages of Víznar and Alfacar.\n\nThe excavations began at the request of another victim's family. Following a long-standing objection, the Lorca family also gave their permission. In October 2009 Francisco Espínola, a spokesman for the Justice Ministry of the Andalusian regional government, said that after years of pressure García Lorca's body would \"be exhumed in a matter of weeks\". Lorca's relatives, who had initially opposed an exhumation, said they might provide a DNA sample in order to identify his remains.\n\nIn late November 2009, after two weeks of excavating the site, organic material believed to be human bones was recovered. The remains were taken to the University of Granada for examination. But in mid-December 2009, doubts were raised as to whether the poet's remains would be found. The dig produced \"not one bone, item of clothing or bullet shell\", said Begoña Álvarez, justice minister of Andalucia. She added, \"the soil was only 40cm (16in) deep, making it too shallow for a grave\". The failed excavation cost €70,000.\n\nIn January 2012, a local historian, Miguel Caballero Pérez, author of \"The last 13 hours of García Lorca\", applied for permission to excavate another area less than half a kilometre from the site, where he believes Lorca's remains are located.\n\nClaims in 2016, by Stephen Roberts, an associate professor in Spanish literature at Nottingham University, and others that the poet's body was buried in a well in Alfacar have not been substantiated.\n\nFrancisco Franco's Falangist regime placed a general ban on García Lorca's work, which was not rescinded until 1953. That year, a (censored) \"Obras completas\" (\"Complete Works\") was released. Following this, \"Blood Wedding\", \"Yerma\" and \"The House of Bernarda Alba\" were successfully played on the main Spanish stages. \"Obras completas\" did not include his late heavily homoerotic \"Sonnets of Dark Love\", written in November 1935 and shared only with close friends. They were lost until 1983/4 when they were finally published in draft form. (No final manuscripts have ever been found.) It was only after Franco's death that García Lorca's life and death could be openly discussed in Spain. This was due not only to political censorship, but also to the reluctance of the García Lorca family to allow publication of unfinished poems and plays prior to the publication of a critical edition of his works.\n\nSouth African Roman Catholic poet Roy Campbell, who enthusiastically supported the Nationalists both during and after the Civil War, later produced acclaimed translations of Lorca's work. In his poem, \"The Martyrdom of F. Garcia Lorca\", Campbell wrote,\n\n<poem>\nNot only did he lose his life\nBy shots assassinated:\nBut with a hammer and a knife\nWas after that \n– translated.</poem>\n\nIn Granada, the city of his birth, the Parque Federico García Lorca is dedicated to his memory and includes the Huerta de San Vicente, the Lorca family summer home, opened as a museum in 1995. The grounds, including nearly two hectares of land, the two adjoining houses, works of art, and the original furnishings have been preserved. There is a new statue of Lorca on the Avenida de la Constitución in the city center, and a new cultural center bearing his name is currently under construction and will play a major role in preserving and disseminating his works.\n\nThe Parque Federico García Lorca, in Alfacar, is near Fuente Grande; in 2009 excavations in it failed to locate Lorca's body. Close to the olive tree indicated by some as marking the location of the grave, there is a stone memorial to Federico García Lorca and all other victims of the Civil War, 1936–39. Flowers are laid at the memorial every year on the anniversary of his death, and a commemorative event including music and readings of the poet's works is held every year in the park to mark the anniversary. On 17 August 2011, to remember the 75th anniversary of Lorca's assassination and to celebrate his life and legacy, this event included dance, song, poetry and dramatic readings and attracted hundreds of spectators.\n\nAt the Barranco de Viznar, between Viznar and Alfacar, there is a memorial stone bearing the words \"Lorca eran todos, 18-8-2002\" (\"All were Lorca\"). The Barranco de Viznar is the site of mass graves and has been proposed as another possible location of the poet's remains.\n\nGarcía Lorca is honored by a statue prominently located in Madrid's Plaza de Santa Ana. Political philosopher David Crocker reports that \"the statue, at least, is still an emblem of the contested past: each day, the Left puts a red kerchief on the neck of the statue, and someone from the Right comes later to take it off.\"\n\nThe Fundación Federico García Lorca, directed by Lorca's niece Laura García Lorca, sponsors the celebration and dissemination of the writer's work and is currently building the Centro Federico García Lorca in Madrid. The Lorca family deposited all Federico documents with the foundation, which holds them on their behalf.\n\nIn the Hotel Castelar in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where Lorca lived for six months in 1933, the room where he lived has been kept as a shrine and contains original writings and drawings of his.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Such clothing range from exotic stylized bathing suits to extreme costuming including body armor and sci-fi fantasy suits.\n\nFetish modeling may involve bondage, body modification, fetish photography and exotic glamour photography as well as sexual fantasy costuming (i.e. maid's outfits, nurses, etc.). Fetish models may model for photography, and appear at BDSM fairs and parties.\n\nSeveral pornographic actors and glamour models also act as fetish models.\n\nFetish modelling covers a wide range of fetishes, including those involving bondage, latex, corsets, even wedgies, tattoo/body piercing, shoes, thin fetishism, shibari, and Nyotaimori / food. Fetishes may also involve body parts, such as breasts, navel, feet, and so on.\n\nFetish models are usually considered to be in a different category to gothic or alternative models, who are usually far more niche specific. Fetish models may only involve themselves in the overall aesthetic aspects rather than work directly with sex and sexuality. Fetish modelling is usually considered to be a part of the adult industry due to its popular perception as an \"adult only\" appreciation. However, in recent times, many aspects of the fetish fashion market have been incorporated and accepted into mainstream fashion whereby fashion creators will directly use exotic fabrics such as latex or sheer instead of cotton or wool for their creations.\n\nThere have been several notable performers and producers of both the bondage and fetish area who have attained mainstream notability. The most recognized is the 1950s bondage model and pin-up girl, Bettie Page who posed for photographer Irving Klaw for mail-order photographs and was subsequently featured in Playboy.\nIn the 1960s the popular British TV program, \"The Avengers\" incorporated much fetish costuming for their lead female performers including Diana Rigg's famous leather catsuits and leotards as well as Tara King's continual thigh-length boots and shoulder length leather gloves.\n\nThere are specialized publications that feature and promote fetish models, including \"Skin Two\", \"Secret\", Italian \"A Magazine\" (not to be confused with the now defunct \"A(sian) Magazine\"), and \"Marquis\".\n\nFetish models may run personal adult pay websites and are featured on fetish adult pay sites.\n\nThere are also fetish fashion designers. Most of these designers employ fetish models for their clothing line. Fetish fashion shows are hosted several times a year, including Vex, The Baroness, Skintwo, and House of Harlot.\n\nThe SIGNY awards were awarded each year between 2000 and 2005 (except 2002) to the bondage models voted as the best of that year.

{"id": "6382443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6382443", "title": "Film Booking Offices of America", "text": "Film Booking Offices of America\n\nFilm Booking Offices of America (FBO), also known as FBO Pictures Corporation, was an American film studio of the silent era, a producer and distributor of mostly low-budget films. It was founded in 1920 as Robertson–Cole (U.S.), the American division of a British import–export company formed by the English-born Harry F. Robertson. Robertson-Cole bought the Hallmark Exchanges (formerly the Mutual Exchanges that became known as Exhibitors-Mutual Exchanges) from Frank G. Hall in 1920. Exhibitors-Mutual/Hallmark had distributed Robertson-Cole product, and acquiring the exchanges gave them the right to distribute their own films plus Hall's product, with the exception of Charlie Chaplin reissues which he had the rights to.\n\nRobertson-Cole initiated movie production in the United States in 1920. That year, it incorporated Robertson-Cole Studios, Inc. and bought 460 acres in Pacific Palisades, California to establish a studio. The property, which became known as the \"R.C. Ranch\", enabled Robertson-Cole to centralize movie production, which previously had been scattered. The movie company had relied on equipment rentals to produce motion pictures. Two years later, a corporate reorganization led to the company's new name, with FBO becoming the official name of the distributing operation and Robertson-Cole Pictures Corp. the name of the production operation. In 1923, the studio contracted with Western actor Fred Thomson, who would soon emerge as one of Hollywood's most popular stars. Thomson was just one of numerous screen cowboys with whom FBO became identified.\n\nThe studio, whose core market was America's small towns, also put out many romantic melodramas, non-Western action pictures, and comedic shorts. In 1926, financier Joseph P. Kennedy led a group that acquired the company. In June 1928, using RCA Photophone technology, FBO became only the second Hollywood studio to release a feature-length \"talkie.\" A few months later, when Kennedy and RCA chief David Sarnoff arranged the merger that created RKO, FBO was included in the new company.\n\nThe company that would become FBO began as the U.S.-based movie subsidiary of the British importer, exporter, and film distributor Robertson-Cole. This organization was similar in structure to the French Pathé Exchange company, a subsidiary of the French Pathé Frères company. From its U.S. headquarters in New York City, R-C Pictures, as it was sometimes known, first entered the American film distribution market. In 1919, the company forged an alliance with Exhibitors Mutual Distributing, a corporate descendant of the Mutual Film studio. The first of R-C's own feature productions to be released was \"The Wonder Man\", directed by John G. Adolfi and starring Georges Carpentier, which debuted May 29, 1920. With its move into production, Robertson-Cole established a 13.5-acre (5.5-hectare) studio in Los Angeles's fortuitously named Colegrove district, then adjacent to but soon to be subsumed by Hollywood. In January 1921, Robertson-Cole absorbed Hallmark Pictures, which had acquired the Exhibitors Mutual interests the previous year. The first official Robertson-Cole production shot at the new studio was a February 1921 release, \"The Mistress of Shenstone\", directed by Henry King and starring beautiful Pauline Frederick, a former Paramount and Goldwyn star. That year, the British owners of the studio entered into a working relationship with Joseph P. Kennedy, father of future U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Joseph Kennedy was then a broker at the New York banking firm of Hayden, Stone, as well as the owner of Maine–New Hampshire Theatres, a small chain of movie houses. Though he failed to arrange the sale R-C's general partners were looking for, Kennedy's involvement with the studio was far from over.\n\nIn 1922, Robertson-Cole underwent a major reorganization as the company's founders departed, though the corporation remained under majority British ownership. The flagship U.S. distribution business changed its name to Film Booking Offices of America, a banner under which R-C had released more than a dozen independent productions. The West Coast studio apparently continued to make films under the Robertson-Cole name for some time, but FBO ultimately became the primary identity of the business for production as well as distribution. Between the 1922 reorganization and October 1923, one of the company's new American investors, Pat Powers, was effectively in command. Powers had previously led his own filmmaking company, part of the multiple merger that created the large Universal studio in 1912. Powers apparently changed the name of Robertson-Cole/FBO to the Powers Studio for a brief period, though there is no record of the company ever having produced or released a film under that banner. In 1923, the studio launched a series of boxing-themed shorts, \"Fighting Blood\", starring George O'Hara. He would become an FBO mainstay, often paired with Alberta Vaughn, in such comedy series as \"The Pacemakers\" (1925). Most of O'Hara's and Vaughn's films for the studio were two-reelers—a measure of film length indicating a running time of about twenty minutes.\n\nNow a fully independent businessman, Joseph Kennedy joined the FBO board of directors in 1923, as well. By this time, the studio was owned by Graham's of London, a banking firm, and Powers was succeeded by H.C.S. Thomson, a Graham's operative. Before leaving the board the following year, Kennedy put together a major distribution and production deal between FBO and leading Western star Fred Thomson. B. P. Fineman became the studio's production chief in 1924; Evelyn Brent, his wife, moved over from Fox to become FBO's top dramatic star. In April 1925, FBO vice-president Joseph I. Schnitzer signed Thomson to a new contract paying him $10,000 a week (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars). Thomson was now the highest paid of all cowboy actors, surpassing even the renowned Tom Mix. The deal also gave Thomson his own independent production unit at the studio.\n\nAs a distributor, FBO's roster of films was about half independent and foreign productions, half its own studio output. At the height of its activity (1923–28), it released an average of around 110 features and shorts a year, focusing on distribution to small-town exhibitors and independent theater chains (that is, those not owned by one of the major Hollywood studios). As a production company, Film Booking Offices concentrated on low-budget movies, with an emphasis on Westerns, romantic melodramas, and comedy shorts. From its first productions in early 1920 through late 1928, when it was dissolved in a merger, the company produced approximately 400 films under the brand of either Robertson-Cole Pictures or FBO Pictures. Between 1924 and 1926, several higher-end productions were made under the rubric of Gothic Pictures. The studio's top-of-the-line movies, aimed at major exhibition venues beyond the reach of most FBO films, were sometimes marketed as FBO \"Gold Bond\" pictures. Without the backing of large corporate interests, nor the security of its own theater chain, the company faced cash-flow difficulties during its earlier years. Short-term loans at high interest rates posed a significant financial drain.\n\nWhile still at Hayden, Stone, Kennedy had boasted to a colleague, \"Look at that bunch of pants pressers in Hollywood making themselves millionaires. I could take the whole business away from them.\" In 1925, he set out to do so, forming his own group of investors led by wealthy Boston lawyer Guy Currier and including Filene's department store owner Louis Kirstein and Union Stockyards and Armour and Company owner Frederick H. Prince. In August 1925, Kennedy traveled to England with an offer to buy a controlling stake in Film Booking Offices for $1 million. The bid was initially rejected, but in February 1926, FBO's owners decided to take the money. In short order, Kennedy moved his family from Massachusetts to New York City to focus on running his new business. He swiftly addressed the company's perennial cash-flow problems, arranging lines of credit and issuing stock in a business division he established, the Cinema Credit Corporation. By March, he was traveling to Hollywood. The president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association, Will Hays, was delighted by the new face on the scene—in Hays's eyes, Kennedy signified both a desirable image for the industry and Wall Street's faith in its prospects. Hays heralded Kennedy as \"exceedingly American\" (historian Cari Beauchamp explains the connotation: \"not Jewish,\" in contrast to most of the studio heads), while celebrating Kennedy's \"background of lofty and conservative financial connections, an atmosphere of much home and family life and all those fireside virtues of which the public never hears in the current news from Hollywood.\"\n\nFineman and Brent both departed FBO around the time of the purchase. Kennedy appointed Edwin King as the studio's production chief, but the new owner took a personal hand in guiding the company creatively as well as financially. Kennedy soon brought stability to FBO, making it one of the most reliably profitable outfits in the minor leagues of the Hollywood studio system. Westerns remained the studio's backbone, along with various action pictures and romantic scenarios; as Kennedy put it, \"Melodrama is our meat.\" During this period, the average production cost of FBO features was around $50,000, and few were budgeted at anything more than $75,000. By comparison, in 1927–28 the average cost at Fox was $190,000; at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, $275,000. One major expense was taken on directly by Kennedy: with several studios competing for Fred Thomson, Kennedy signed him to a personal contract for $15,000 a week. This was the highest straight salary for any actor in the industry, matched only by Tom Mix's new arrangement with Fox. Under the contract, Kennedy struck a deal in early 1927 with Paramount Pictures for the major studio to produce and distribute a series of four Thomson \"super westerns.\" Kennedy participated in the films' financing (and profits) and the actor's company stayed on the FBO lot. Of the four Thomson features that reached theaters in 1927, three were FBO releases.\n\nThe advent of sound film would drastically alter the studio's course: Negotiations that began in late 1927 with the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) on a deal for sound conversion led to RCA purchasing a major interest in FBO in January 1928. Four months later, as part of a strategy conceived with RCA head David Sarnoff, Kennedy acquired control of Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO), a vaudeville exhibition chain with approximately one hundred theaters across the United States, and with the Pathé Exchange and Cecil B. De Mille's Producers Distributing Corporation under its control.\n\nOn June 17, 1928, FBO's \"The Perfect Crime\", directed by Bert Glennon and starring Clive Brook and Irene Rich, debuted. It was the first feature-length \"talkie\" to appear from a studio other than Warner Bros. since the epochal premiere of Warners' \"The Jazz Singer\" eight months before. \"The Perfect Crime\", which went into general release on August 4, had been shot silently. Using the RCA Photophone sound-on-film system, the dialogue was dubbed in afterward—a process then known as \"synthetic sound.\" On August 22, Kennedy signed a contract with RCA for live Photophone recording; more importantly, he also tendered the company an option to buy his governing share of FBO. Two months later, RCA had acquired controlling stock interests in both the studio and KAO.\n\nOn October 23, 1928, RCA announced it was merging Film Booking Offices and Keith-Albee-Orpheum to form the new motion picture business Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO), with Sarnoff as chairman. Kennedy, who retained Pathé, was paid $150,000 for arranging the merger on top of the millions of dollars in profit he made from selling off his stock. Joseph I. Schnitzer, ranking FBO vice-president, was elevated to president of the new company's production arm, replacing Kennedy. William LeBaron, the last FBO production chief, retained his position after the merger, but the new studio, dedicated to full sound production, cut ties with most of FBO's roster of silent-screen performers. Movies that Film Booking Offices had either produced or arranged to distribute were released under the FBO banner through the end of 1929. The last official FBO production to reach American theaters was \"Pals of the Prairie\", directed by Louis King and starring Buzz Barton and Frank Rice, released July 1, 1929.\n\nThe vast majority of FBO/Robertson-Cole pictures, produced during either the silent era or the transitional period of the conversion to sound cinema, are considered to be lost films, with no copies now known to exist. Partly in consequence, many of FBO's star actors are barely remembered today.\n\nPauline Frederick was the major headliner of the early R-C days, and Evelyn Brent was FBO's most prized non-Western star. Warner Baxter, Joe E. Brown, and young Frankie Darro were among the other prominent FBO players. Anna Q. Nilsson starred in two of the studio's larger productions, as did Olive Borden and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. FBO's leading star of action and mystery pictures was Richard Talmadge. He appeared in eighteen FBO releases, more than half of them produced by his own company. Maurice \"Lefty\" Flynn starred in over a dozen FBO action films, all directed by Harry Garson, who also ran his own production business. From the studio's pre-Hollywood days in 1920 through 1928, Ralph Lewis starred in more than ten R-C and FBO pictures of various genres. Former model Reed Howes, renowned as an \"Arrow Collar Man\", made his acting debut with FBO after an extensive publicity campaign.\n\nIn its earlier years, the studio did not hesitate to take advantage of scandal sheet–worthy events. After the death of celebrated \"Paramount\" actor Wallace Reid, brought on by morphine addiction, his widow, Dorothy Davenport, signed on as producer and star of a cinematic examination of the sins of substance abuse: \"Human Wreckage\", released by FBO in June 1923, five months after Reid's death, featured Davenport (billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid) as the wife of a noble attorney turned dope fiend.\n\nWhen the biggest movie star in the world, Rudolph Valentino, split from his wife, Natacha Rambova, she was swiftly enlisted by the studio to costar with Clive Brook in the sensitively titled \"When Love Grows Cold\" (1926). Under Kennedy's control, studio production shifted away from provocative fare in an attempt to brand the studio's films as suitable for the \"average American\" and the entire family: \"We can't make pictures and label them 'For Children,' or 'For Women' or 'For Stout People' or 'For Thin Ones.' We must make pictures that have appeal to all.\" Though Kennedy ended the scandal-sheet specials, FBO still found occasion for celebrity casting: \"One Minute to Play\" (1926), directed by Sam Wood, marks the film debut of football great \"Red\" Grange.\n\nCentral to the FBO identity were Westerns and the studio's major cowboy star, Fred Thomson. In both 1926 and 1927, he ranked number two in the \"Exhibitors' Herald\" survey of the \"Top Stars of the Year,\" right behind Tom Mix. With Thomson's personal contract with Kennedy due to expired in mid-1927, Kennedy—sending that Thomson had reached the peak of his popularity and seeing a financial opportunity for FBO—arranged a four-picture deal with Paramount Pictures, one of the major Hollywood studio. The deal essentially ceded Thomson to the rival studio. For FBO's guarantee of $75,000 in financing per picture, Thomson would star in Paramount productions. In return, Paramount would return the $75,000 in financing plus an additional $100,000 to FBO and pay Thomson's $15,000 a week salary.\n\nIn 1928, Kennedy replaced Thomson by signing Tom Mix, whose contract with William Fox's Fox Film Corporation had expired. Mix played hard-to-get, threatening to move to Argentina to make films or joining the circus, but eventually, he signed with FBO but eventually left for Universal due to salary disputes with the studio. He said of Kennedy that he was a \"tight-assed, money-crazed son-of-a-bitch\".\n\nFBO's second-biggest long-running Western star was Tom Tyler. According to a June 1927 report in \"Moving Picture World\":With Tom Tyler rapidly taking the place recently vacated by Fred Thomson, F.B.O.'s program of western pictures is taking a place second to none in the industry... Tyler has made rapid strides during his two years with F.B.O. and with his horse 'Flash' and dog 'Beans' has become one of the leading favorites on the screen.\n\nIn addition to these three big names there was also Harry Carey, still a major star when he made several films for the studio in 1922–23. The other cowboy stars of FBO included Bob Custer, Bob Steele, and teenager Buzz Barton.\n\nOne of the studio's most reliable Western headliners was a dog: Ranger. The fabled Strongheart starred in FBO's \"White Fang\" (1925), and Rin Tin Tin had one of his earliest roles in \"My Dad\" (1922).\n\nFBO's many shorts—the popular George O'Hara and Alberta Vaughn series, and scores of others—are largely forgotten. Of particular historical interest are two independently produced series of slapstick comedies with important performers: FBO put out several shorts in 1924–25 made by Joe Rock and starring Stan Laurel, before his famous partnership with Oliver Hardy. In 1926–27, the company distributed more than a dozen shorts by innovative comedian/animator Charles Bowers.\n\nIn addition to the work of Charles Bowers, FBO was a distributor of other significant animated films. Between 1924 and 1926, FBO released the work of John Randolph Bray's cartoon studio, including the \"Dinky Doodle\" series created by Walter Lantz. From 1925 to 1927, the studio put out approximately three dozen animated adaptations of George Herriman newspaper comics directed by William Nolan, featuring characters from Herriman's famed \"Krazy Kat\" strip. FBO picked up the \"Krazy Kat\" cartoons from the distribution team of Margaret Winkler and her husband, Charles Mintz. In 1926, FBO struck a deal with the Winkler–Mintz operation for another series, one that, like Bowers' shorts, involved both animation and a live performer: the \"Alice Comedies\", of which FBO would put out over two dozen, were created by two young animators, Ub Iwerks and Walt Disney.\n\nKennedy had no illusions about his studio's place in the realm of cinematic art. A journalist once complimented him on FBO's recent output: \"You have had some good pictures this year.\" Kennedy jocularly inquired, \"What the hell \"were\" they?\" In her history of RKO, author Betty Lasky points to the pre-Kennedy \"Broken Laws\" (1924), directed by Roy William Neill and starring Dorothy Davenport (again billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid) as exemplifying the rare \"unforgettable picture of the higher caliber\" put out by FBO.\n\nAmong the studio's action movies, one standout production was a 1927 Tarzan picture. Author Edgar Rice Burroughs declared, \"If you want to see the personification of Tarzan of the Apes as I visualize him, see the film \"Tarzan and the Golden Lion\" with Mr. James Pierce.\" The \"Film Daily\" reviewer wrote that the movie \"has a rather new order of thrills and atmosphere that might prove distinctly attractive.\" The two-reeler \"West of Hot Dog\" (1924), according to historian Simon Louvish, contains \"one of Stan [Laurel]'s finest gags,\" involving a level of cinematic technique that bears comparison to Buster Keaton's classic \"Sherlock, Jr.\"\n\nSome of the studio's most impressive releases were foreign productions. In 1927, FBO picked up for U.S. distribution a celebrated Austrian biblical spectacular made three years earlier: \"Die Sklavenkönigin\" (\"The Slave Queen\", aka \"Moon of Israel\") had already won its director, Michael Kertész, a job with Warner Bros. In Hollywood, he would change his name to Michael Curtiz. \"Una Nueva y gloriosa nación\" (1928), the most successful film in the history of Argentine silent cinema, was shot in Hollywood and distributed in the United States by FBO as \"The Charge of the Gauchos\".\n\nOne of the two cinematographers of \"Una Nueva y gloriosa nación\" was Nicholas Musuraca, who established his career at Film Booking Offices. With RKO, Musuraca would become one of Hollywood's most respected cinematographers.\n\nAmong FBO's other offscreen talent, the best known director to work regularly at the studio was Ralph Ince, younger brother of famous filmmaker Thomas H. Ince. Pulling double duty on occasion, Ralph Ince starred in four of the fourteen films he made for FBO. One production in which Ince served in both capacities was particularly well received: \"Chicago After Midnight\" (1928) was described by the \"New York Times\" as \"[a]n unusually well-acted and adroitly directed underworld story.\" After \"The Mistress of Shenstone\", Henry King directed two more R-C films with Pauline Frederick, also in 1921: \"Salvage\" and \"The Sting of the Lash\". Tod Browning directed two Gothic Pictures specials in 1924 starring Evelyn Brent: \"The Dangerous Flirt\" and \"Silk Stocking Sal\".\n\nFrom 1921 to 1924, William Seiter directed a half-dozen FBO releases, some produced directly for the studio, others independently. Between 1922 and 1926, Emory Johnson produced and directed at least eight films for FBO. Historian William K. Everson has pointed to Seiter and Johnson as two of the overlooked directorial talents of the silent era.\n\nScreenwriter Frances Marion, who would win two Oscars in the 1930s, penned ten of the FBO pictures starring her husband, Fred Thomson. Editor Pandro S. Berman, son of a major FBO stockholder, cut his first film for the studio at the age of twenty-two; he would go on to renown as an RKO producer and production chief. Famed RKO costume designer Walter Plunkett was also an FBO graduate.\n\n"}

{"id": "21747724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21747724", "title": "Geer tube", "text": "Geer tube\n\nThe Geer tube was an early single-tube color television cathode ray tube, developed by Willard Geer. The Geer tube used a pattern of small phosphor-covered three-sided pyramids on the inside of the CRT faceplate to mix separate red, green and blue signals from three electron guns. The Geer tube had a number of disadvantages, and was never used commercially due to the much better images generated by RCA's shadow mask system. Nevertheless, Geer's patent was awarded first, and RCA purchased an option on it in case their own developments didn't pan out.\n\nColor television had been studied even before commercial broadcasting became common, but it was only in the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered. At the time, a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red, green and blue signals (RGB), broadcast in succession. Most experimental systems broadcast entire frames in sequence, with a colored filter (or \"gel\") that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube. Each frame encoded one color of the picture, and the wheel spun in sync with the signal so the correct gel was in front of the screen when that colored frame was being displayed. Because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors, all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets. Another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used.\n\nRCA worked along different lines entirely, using a luminance-chrominance system. This system did not directly encode or transmit the RGB signals; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure, the \"luminance\". Luminance closely matched the black and white signal of existing broadcasts, allowing it to be displayed on black and white televisions. This was a major advantage over the mechanical systems being proposed by other groups. Color information was then separately encoded and folded into the signal as a high-frequency modification to produce a composite video signal – on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity, but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice. On color sets the signal would be filtered out and added to the luminance to re-create the original RGB for display.\n\nAlthough RCA's system had enormous benefits, it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes. Black and white TVs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even deposit of phosphor. With the luminance concept, the color was changing continually along the line, which was far too fast for any sort of mechanical filter to follow. Instead, the phosphor had to be broken down into a discrete pattern of colored spots. Focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era.\n\nCharles Willard Geer, then an assistant professor at the University of Southern California, was lecturing on the mechanical methods of producing color television that were being experimented with in the 1940s, and decided that an electronically scanned system would be superior, if someone would only invent one. Mentioning it later to his wife, she replied \"You'd better get busy and invent it yourself\".\n\nGeer solved the display problem with the novel application of optics. Instead of trying to focus the electron beams onto tiny spots, he instead focused them onto larger areas and used simple optics to re-combine each individual primary color at any given place on the screen into a single pixel. The tube was arranged with three separate electron guns, one each for red, green and blue (RGB), arranged around the outside of the picture area. This made a Geer tube quite large; the \"necks\" of the tubes normally lie behind the display area and give the TV its depth, whereas in the Geer tube the necks projected around the outside of the display area, making it much larger.\n\nThe rear face of the screen was covered with a series of tiny triangular pyramids imprinted on an aluminum sheet, coated on the inside of each face with colored phosphor. Properly aligned, a given electron beam could only reach one face of the pyramids, striking it and traveling through the thin metal into the thicker phosphor layer inside. When all three guns hit their respective faces, the colored light was created in the interior of the pyramid where it mixed, producing a proper color display on the open base, which faced the user.\n\nOne enormous advantage of the Geer system is that it could be used with any of the proposed color television broadcasting systems. CBS was promoting a \"field sequential\" system at 144 frames per second that they intended to display with a mechanical color filter wheel. This same signal could be displayed on a Geer tube by sending each successive frame to a different gun, in turn. RCA's \"dot sequential\" system could also be shown by de-multiplexing the signals and sending all three color signals to each of the appropriate guns at the same time. B&W signals could be displayed by sending the same signal, muted by 1/3, also to all three guns at the same time.\n\nGetting the electron beam to hit the correct pyramid, and not surrounding ones, was a major problem for the design. The beam from an electron gun is normally circular, so when it was aimed at a triangular target, some part of the beam normally went past the target pyramid and hit others on the screen. This results in \"overscan\", causing the image to be blurry and washed out. The problem was particularly difficult to solve because the angle between the beam and faces changed as the beams scanned the tube – pyramids near the gun would be hit at close to a right angle, but ones at the opposite side of the tube were at an acute angle. Considering that each gun was offset from the CRT's main axis, it was necessary to make major geometrical corrections to the raster geometry during the scan.\n\nGeer filed for a patent on his design on 11 July 1944. Technicolor purchased the patent rights and started development of prototype units in concert with the Stanford Research Institute, spending a reported $500,000 in 1950 (approx. equivalent, $4 million, in 2005) on development. The system was widely reported on at the time, including mentions in \"Time Magazine\", \"Popular Science\", \"Popular Mechanics\", \"Radio Electronics\", and others.\n\nMany other companies were also working on color television systems, most notably RCA. They had filed a patent on their shadow mask system only a few weeks after Geer. When Geer, and Technicolor, informed RCA of their patent, RCA took out licenses and adding further funding to the project as a \"second iron in the fire\" in case none of their in-house developments worked out.\n\nIn head-to-head testing against other color television systems for the NTSC color standardization efforts that started in November 1949, Geer's tube did not fare particularly well. Overscan bled the colors into neighboring pixels and led to soft colors and poor color registration and contrast. This problem was by no means limited to the Geer tube; several different technologies were demonstrated at the show, and only the CBS mechanical system proved able to produce a picture that satisfied the judges. In 1950, the CBS system was adopted as the NTSC standard.\n\nGeer continued to work on the overscan problems throughout the late 1940s and into the 1950s, filing additional patents on various corrections to improve the system. Other vendors were making similar strides with their own technologies, and in 1953 the NTSC reconvened a panel to consider the color issue. This time RCA's shadow mask system quickly demonstrated itself as superior to all the other systems, including Geer's. The shadow mask remained the primary method of building color televisions, with Sony Trinitron a distant second, until the early 2000s when LCD technology replaced CRTs. At the same time, RCA's version of color encoding into a signal that was compatible with existing B&W sets was also adopted, with modifications, and remained the primary U.S. television standard until 2009, when analog television was shut down.\n\nGeer continued to work on his basic concept for some time, as well as other television related concepts. In 1955 he filed a patent on a flat TV tube that used a gun arranged to lie beside the image area that fired upward towards the top. The beam was deflected through 90 degrees by a series of charged wires so the beam was now traveling horizontally across the back of the picture area. A second grid, located beside the first, then bent the beams through a small angle so they hit the back of the screen.\n\nIt does not appear that this device was ever constructed, and the arrangement of aiming elements suggests focusing the image would be a serious problem. Two other inventors had been working on this problem was well, Dennis Gabor in England (better known for the development of holograms) and William Aiken in the US. Both of their patents were filed before Geer's, and the Aiken tube was successfully built in small numbers. More recently, similar concepts were used, combined with computer controlled convergence systems, to produce \"flatter\" systems, typically for computer monitor use. Sony sold small-screen monochrome TVs using basically-similar nearly-flat CRTs; they were used for outside-broadcast monitors, as well. However these were quickly displaced by LCD-based systems.\n\nIn 1960 he filed for a patent on a three-dimensional television system that used two color tubes and a 2-dimensional version of his pyramids. The vertical channels reflected the light in two directions, providing different images for each eye.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "486086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=486086", "title": "Grotesque", "text": "Grotesque\n\nSince at least the 18th century (in French, German and English), grotesque (or grottoesque) has come to be used as a general adjective for the strange, mysterious, magnificent, fantastic, hideous, ugly, incongruous, unpleasant, or disgusting, and thus is often used to describe weird shapes and distorted forms such as Halloween masks. In art, performance, and literature, however, \"grotesque\" may also refer to something that simultaneously invokes in an audience a feeling of uncomfortable bizarreness as well as sympathetic pity. More specifically, the grotesque forms on Gothic buildings, when not used as drain-spouts, should not be called gargoyles, but rather referred to simply as grotesques, or chimeras.\n\nThe word was originally a noun (1560s), from Italian grottesco (through Middle French), literally \"of a cave\", from Italian \"grotta\" (see grotto), an extravagant style of Ancient Roman decorative art rediscovered and then copied in Rome at the end of the 15th century. The word first was used of paintings found on the walls of basements of Roman ruins that were called at that time \"Le Grotte\" (The Grottoes) due to their appearance. These \"caves\" were in fact rooms and corridors of the Domus Aurea, the unfinished palace complex started by Nero after the Great Fire of Rome in CE 64, which had become overgrown and buried, until they were broken into again, mostly from above. Spreading from Italian to the other European languages, the term was long used largely interchangeably with arabesque and moresque for types of decorative patterns using curving foliage elements.\n\nRémi Astruc has argued that although there is an immense variety of motifs and figures, the three main tropes of the grotesque are doubleness, hybridity and metamorphosis. Beyond the current understanding of the grotesque as an aesthetic category, he demonstrated how the grotesque functions as a fundamental existential experience. Moreover, Astruc identifies the grotesque as a crucial, and potentially universal, anthropological device that societies have used to conceptualize alterity and change. \n\nIn art, grotesques are ornamental arrangements of arabesques with interlaced garlands and small and fantastic human and animal figures, usually set out in a symmetrical pattern around some form of architectural framework, though this may be very flimsy. Such designs were fashionable in ancient Rome, as fresco wall decoration, floor mosaics, etc., and were decried by Vitruvius (c. 30 BC), who in dismissing them as meaningless and illogical, offered the description: \"reeds are substituted for columns, fluted appendages with curly leaves and volutes take the place of pediments, candelabra support representations of shrines, and on top of their roofs grow slender stalks and volutes with human figures senselessly seated upon them.\"\n\nWhen Nero's palace in Rome, the Domus Aurea, was inadvertently rediscovered in the late 15th century, buried in fifteen hundred years of fill, the first breakthrough was from above, so that those keen to see the rooms had to be lowered down into them on ropes, completing their resemblance to caves, or grottoes in Italian. The Roman wall decorations in fresco and delicate stucco were a revelation.\n\nThe first appearance of the word \"grottesche\" appears in a contract of 1502 for the Piccolomini Library attached to the duomo of Siena. They were introduced by Raphael Sanzio and his team of decorative painters, who developed \"grottesche\" into a complete system of ornament in the Loggias that are part of the series of Raphael's Rooms in the Vatican Palace, Rome. \"The decorations astonished and charmed a generation of artists that was familiar with the grammar of the classical orders but had not guessed till then that in their private houses the Romans had often disregarded those rules and had adopted instead a more fanciful and informal style that was all lightness, elegance and grace.\" In these grotesque decorations a tablet or candelabrum might provide a focus; frames were extended into scrolls that formed part of the surrounding designs as a kind of scaffold, as Peter Ward-Jackson noted. Light scrolling grotesques could be ordered by confining them within the framing of a pilaster to give them more structure. Giovanni da Udine took up the theme of grotesques in decorating the Villa Madama, the most influential of the new Roman villas.\n\nIn the 16th century, such artistic license and irrationality was controversial matter. Francisco de Holanda puts a defense in the mouth of Michelangelo in his third dialogue of \"Da Pintura Antiga\", 1548:\n\"this insatiable desire of man sometimes prefers to an ordinary building, with its pillars and doors, one falsely constructed in grotesque style, with pillars formed of children growing out of stalks of flowers, with architraves and cornices of branches of myrtle and doorways of reeds and other things, all seeming impossible and contrary to reason, yet it may be really great work if it is performed by a skillful artist.\"\n\nThe delight of Mannerist artists and their patrons in arcane iconographic programs available only to the erudite could be embodied in schemes of \"grottesche\", Andrea Alciato's \"Emblemata\" (1522) offered ready-made iconographic shorthand for vignettes. More familiar material for grotesques could be drawn from Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\".\n\nThe Vatican loggias, a loggia corridor space in the Apostolic Palace open to the elements on one side, were decorated around 1519 by Raphaels's large team of artists, with Giovanni da Udine the main hand involved. Because of the relative unimportance of the space, and a desire to copy the Domus Aurea style, no large paintings were used, and the surfaces were mostly covered with grotesque designs on a white background, with paintings imitating sculptures in niches, and small figurative subjects in a revival of Ancient Roman style. This large array provided a repertoire of elements that were the basis for later artists across Europe.\n\nIn Michelangelo's Medici Chapel Giovanni da Udine composed during 1532-33 \"most beautiful sprays of foliage, rosettes and other ornaments in stucco and gold\" in the coffers and \"sprays of foliage, birds, masks and figures\", with a result that did not please Pope Clement VII Medici, however, nor Giorgio Vasari, who whitewashed the grottesche decor in 1556. Counter Reformation writers on the arts, notably Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti, bishop of Bologna, turned upon \"grottesche\" with a righteous vengeance.\n\nVasari, echoing Vitruvius, described the style as follows:\"Grotesques are a type of extremely licentious and absurd painting done by the ancients ... without any logic, so that a weight is attached to a thin thread which could not support it, a horse is given legs made of leaves, a man has crane's legs, with countless other impossible absurdities; and the bizarrer the painter's imagination, the higher he was rated\".\n\nVasari recorded that Francesco Ubertini, called \"Bacchiacca\", delighted in inventing \"grotteschi\", and (about 1545) painted for Duke Cosimo de' Medici a \"studiolo\" in a mezzanine at the Palazzo Vecchio \"full of animals and rare plants\". Other 16th-century writers on \"grottesche\" included Daniele Barbaro, Pirro Ligorio and Gian Paolo Lomazzo.\n\nIn the meantime, through the medium of engravings the grotesque mode of surface ornament passed into the European artistic repertory of the 16th century, from Spain to Poland. A classic suite was that attributed to Enea Vico, published in 1540-41 under an evocative explanatory title, \"Leviores et extemporaneae picturae quas grotteschas vulgo vocant\", \"Light and extemporaneous pictures that are vulgarly called grotesques\". Later Mannerist versions, especially in engraving, tended to lose that initial lightness and be much more densely filled than the airy well-spaced style used by the Romans and Raphael.\n\nSoon \"grottesche\" appeared in marquetry (fine woodwork), in maiolica produced above all at Urbino from the late 1520s, then in book illustration and in other decorative uses. At Fontainebleau Rosso Fiorentino and his team enriched the vocabulary of grotesques by combining them with the decorative form of strapwork, the portrayal of leather straps in plaster or wood moldings, which forms an element in grotesques.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries the grotesque encompasses a wide field of teratology (science of monsters) and artistic experimentation. The monstrous, for instance, often occurs as the notion of \"play\". The sportiveness of the grotesque category can be seen in the notion of the preternatural category of the \"lusus naturae\", in natural history writings and in cabinets of curiosities. The last vestiges of romance, such as the marvellous also provide opportunities for the presentation of the grotesque in, for instance, operatic spectacle. The mixed form of the novel was commonly described as grotesque - see for instance Fielding's \"comic epic poem in prose\". (\"Joseph Andrews\" and \"Tom Jones\")\n\nGrotesque ornament received a further impetus from new discoveries of original Roman frescoes and stucchi at Pompeii and the other buried sites round Mount Vesuvius from the middle of the century. It continued in use, becoming increasingly heavy, in the Empire Style and then in the Victorian period, when designs often became as densely packed as in 16th-century engravings, and the elegance and fancy of the style tended to be lost.\n\nArtists began to give the tiny faces of the figures in grotesque decorations strange caricatured expressions, in a direct continuation of the medieval traditions of the drolleries in the border decorations or initials in illuminated manuscripts. From this the term began to be applied to larger caricatures, such as those of Leonardo da Vinci, and the modern sense began to develop. It is first recorded in English in 1646 from Sir Thomas Browne:\"In nature there are no grotesques\". By extension backwards in time, the term became also used for the medieval originals, and in modern terminology medieval drolleries, half-human thumbnail vignettes drawn in the margins, and carved figures on buildings (that are not also waterspouts, and so gargoyles) are also called \"grotesques\".\n\nA boom in the production of works of art in the grotesque genre characterized the period 1920–1933 of German art. In contemporary illustration art, the \"grotesque\" figures, in the ordinary conversational sense, commonly appear in the genre \"grotesque art\", also known as fantastic art.\n\nOne of the first uses of the term grotesque to denote a literary genre is in Montaigne's \"Essays\". The Grotesque is often linked with satire and tragicomedy. It is an effective artistic means to convey grief and pain to the audience, and for this has been labeled by Thomas Mann as the \"genuine antibourgeois style\".\n\nSome of the earliest written texts describe grotesque happenings and monstrous creatures. The literature of Myth has been a rich source of monsters; from the one-eyed Cyclops (to cite one example) from Hesiod's \"Theogony\" to Homer's Polyphemus in the \"Odyssey\". Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" is another rich source for grotesque transformations and hybrid creatures of myth. Horace's \"Art of Poetry\" also provides a formal introduction classical values and to the dangers of grotesque or mixed form. Indeed, the departure from classical models of order, reason, harmony, balance and form opens up the risk of entry into grotesque worlds. Accordingly, British literature abounds with native grotesquerie, from the strange worlds of Spenser's allegory in \"The Faerie Queene\", to the tragi-comic modes of 16th-century drama. (Grotesque comic elements can be found in major works such as \"King Lear\".)\n\nLiterary works of \"mixed\" genre are occasionally termed grotesque, as are \"low\" or non-literary genres such as pantomime and farce. Gothic writings often have grotesque components in terms of character, style and location. In other cases, the environment described may be grotesque - whether urban (Charles Dickens), or the literature of the American south which has sometimes been termed \"Southern Gothic\". Sometimes the grotesque in literature has been explored in terms of social and cultural formations such as the carnival(-esque) in François Rabelais and Mikhail Bakhtin. Terry Castle has written on the relationship between metamorphosis, literary writings and masquerade.\n\nAnother major source of the grotesque is in satirical writings of the 18th century. Jonathan Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\" provides a variety of approaches to grotesque representation. In poetry, the works of Alexander Pope provide many examples of the grotesque.\n\nIn fiction, characters are usually considered grotesque if they induce both empathy and disgust. (A character who inspires disgust alone is simply a villain or a monster.) Obvious examples would include the physically deformed and the mentally deficient, but people with cringe-worthy social traits are also included. The reader becomes piqued by the grotesque's positive side, and continues reading to see if the character can conquer their darker side. In Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\", the figure of Caliban has inspired more nuanced reactions than simple scorn and disgust. Also, in J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\", the character of Gollum may be considered to have both disgusting and empathetic qualities, which fit him into the grotesque template.\n\nVictor Hugo's \"Hunchback of Notre Dame\" is one of the most celebrated grotesques in literature. Dr. Frankenstein's monster can also be considered a grotesque, as well as the title character, Erik in \"The Phantom of the Opera\" and the Beast in Beauty and the Beast. Other instances of the romantic grotesque are also to be found in Edgar Allan Poe, E.T.A. Hoffmann, in \"Sturm und Drang\" literature or in Sterne's \"Tristram Shandy\". The romantic grotesque is far more terrible and sombre than the medieval grotesque, which celebrated laughter and fertility. It is at this point that a grotesque creature such as Frankenstein's monster (in Mary Shelley's novel published in 1818) begins to be presented more sympathetically as the outsider who is the victim of society. But the novel also makes the issue of sympathy problematic in an unkind society. This means that society becomes the generator of the grotesque, by a process of alienation. In fact, the grotesque monster in \"Frankenstein\" tends to be described as 'the creature.'\n\nThe grotesque received a new shape with \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" by Lewis Carroll, when a girl meets fantastic grotesque figures in her fantasy world. Carroll manages to make the figures seem less frightful and fit for children's literature, but still utterly strange. Another comic grotesque writer who played on the relationship between sense and nonsense was Edward Lear. Humorous, or festive nonsense of this kind has its roots in the seventeenth century traditions of fustian, bombastic and satirical writing.\n\nDuring the nineteenth-century category of grotesque body was increasingly displaced by the notion of congenital deformity or medical anomaly. Building on this context, the grotesque begins to be understood more in terms as deformity and disability, especially after the First World War, 1914-18. In these terms, the art historian Leah Dickerman has argued that 'The sight of horrendously shattered bodies of veterans returned to the home front became commonplace. The accompanying growth in the prosthetic industry struck contemporaries as creating a race of half-mechanical men and became an important theme in dadaist work.' The poetry of Wilfred Owen displays a poetic and realistic sense of the grotesque horror of war and the human cost of brutal conflict. Poems such as 'Spring Offensive' and 'Greater Love' combined images of beauty with shocking brutality and violence in order to produce a sense of the grotesque clash of opposites. In a similar fashion, Ernst Friedrich (1894–1967), founder of the Berlin Peace Museum, an anarchist and a pacifist, was the author of \"War Against War\" (1924) which used grotesque photographs of mutilated victims of the First World War in order to campaign for peace.\n\nSouthern Gothic is a genre frequently identified with grotesques and William Faulkner is often cited as the ringmaster. Flannery O'Connor wrote, \"Whenever I'm asked why Southern writers particularly have a penchant for writing about freaks, I say it is because we are still able to recognize one\" (\"Some Aspects of the Grotesque in Southern Fiction\", 1960). In O'Connor's often-anthologized short-story \"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\", the Misfit, a serial killer, is clearly a maimed soul, utterly callous to human life but driven to seek the truth. The less obvious grotesque is the polite, doting grandmother who is unaware of her own astonishing selfishness. Another oft-cited example of the grotesque from O'Connor's work is her short-story entitled \"A Temple Of The Holy Ghost\". The American novelist, Raymond Kennedy is another author associated with the literary tradition of the grotesque.\n\nContemporary writers of literary grotesque fiction include Ian McEwan, Katherine Dunn, Alasdair Gray, Angela Carter, Jeanette Winterson, Umberto Eco, Patrick McGrath, Natsuo Kirino, Paul Tremblay, Matt Bell, Chuck Palahniuk, Brian Evenson, Caleb J. Ross (who writes domestic grotesque fiction), Richard Thomas and many authors who write in the bizarro genre of fiction. In 1929, G.L Van Roosbroeck wrote a book called \"GROTESQUES\" (illustrations by J. Matulka) published by The Williamsport Printing and Binding Co., Williamsport, PA. It is a collection of 6 stories and 3 fables for the children of tomorrow.\n\nOther contemporary writers who have explored the grotesque in pop-culture are John Docker, in the context of postmodernism; Cintra Wilson, who analyzes celebrity; and Francis Sanzaro, who discusses its relation to childbirth and obscenity.\n\nThe term Theatre of the Grotesque refers to an anti-naturalistic school of Italian dramatists, writing in the 1910s and 1920s, who are often seen as precursors of the Theatre of the Absurd.\nCharacterized by ironic and macabre themes of daily life in the world war 1 era. Theatre of the grotesque was named after the play 'The Mask and the Face' by Luigi Chiarelli, which was described as ' a grotesque in three acts'.\n\nFriedrich Dürrenmatt is a major author of contemporary grotesque comedy plays.\n\nIn architecture the term \"grotesque\" means a carved stone figure.\n\nGrotesques are often confused with gargoyles, but the distinction is that gargoyles are figures that contain a water spout through the mouth, while grotesques do not. Without a water spout, this type of sculpture is also known as a chimera when it depicts fantastical creatures. In the Middle Ages, the term \"babewyn\" was used to refer to both gargoyles and grotesques. This word is derived from the Italian word \"babbuino\", which means \"baboon\".\n\nThe word \"Grotesque\", or \"Grotesk\" in German, is also frequently used as a synonym for sans-serif in typography. At other times, it is used (along with \"Neo-Grotesque\", \"Humanist\", \"Lineal\", and \"Geometric\") to describe a particular style or subset of sans-serif typefaces. The origin of this association can be traced back to English typefounder William Thorowgood, who first introduced the term \"grotesque\" and in 1835 produced \"7-line pica grotesque\"—the first sans-serif typeface containing actual lowercase letters. An alternate etymology is possibly based on the original reaction of other typographers to such a strikingly featureless typeface.\n\nPopular Grotesque typefaces include Franklin Gothic, News Gothic, Haettenschweiler and Lucida Sans (although the latter lacks the spurred \"G\"), whereas popular Neo-Grotesque typefaces include Arial, Helvetica and Verdana.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The film is produced by Ánima Estudios, Discreet Arts, and distributed by FilmSharks International. The film is the first English-language and flagship CG production for Ánima Estudios, as well as the studio's biggest production and is described as Mexico's biggest animated production. Mexico's take on the \"Wizard of Oz\" books by L. Frank Baum, it features an original story and new characters, and was released theatrically on 10 April 2015 in Mexico.\n\nIt was released direct-to-video on January 24, 2017 in the United States and features the voices of Mikey Bolts, Ambyr Childers, and Jenn McAllister.\n\nAfter the Wicked Witch of the West is melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy is sent back to her world, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, decides to revive the Wicked Witch and remove her powers by storing them in a magic broom. Glinda then gives the magical broom to Dorothy's friends, Tin Woodman, Cowardly Lion, and Scarecrow, and they become the guardians of the broom.\n\nEvilene, the Wicked Witch, conspires with her Flying Monkeys to retrieve her broom. However, a friendly little monkey named Ozzy forgets to close the gate of the castle and a battle ensues between the flying monkeys and the 'Bums of Oz.' Evilene retrieves her broom and repels the Champions of Oz from the castle. She then punishes Ozzy's father, transforming him into a chicken. Angered by the witch's spell on his father, Ozzy steals the broom from Evilene and runs away from the palace.\n\nOzzy reaches Glinda to find she has been paralyzed by accidentally drinking a magic potion created by her niece Gabby, who is unable to create an antidote without a vital ingredient based on wood. Gabby and Ozzy set off to find the Champions of Oz. They are pursued by the other Flying Monkeys.\n\nThey soon find Cowardly Lion, who is out of sorts due to the witch's spell, but with some effort they guide him to the north town, where they find the Tin Woodman, who is extremely depressed by the spell. The spell-raged Lion smashes the Tin Man to bits, but calms down when Ozzy accidentally hits him with the magic broom.\n\nOzzy, Gaby, and the Cowardly Lion take the Tin Man's parts to the Library of Oz where (due to the spell) Scarecrow is obsessively reading books in an effort to become more intelligent. He quickly repairs Tin with the help from a clue. However, the group is attacked by the Flying Monkeys, and in the chaos Ozzy cures Scarecrow of the spell's effects, but they are unable to save Gabby from being whisked away by the Flying Monkeys.\n\nThe group arrives in Emerald City where the Wicked Witch gives an ultimatum to Ozzy to return the broom. The Guardians of Oz challenge the Witch but they are quickly defeated. Ozzy decides to break the broom in order to remove Evilene's powers for good, and tells the rest of the winged monkeys that they obey Evilene due to their dumb and cowardly mindset. The Monkeys rebel against Evilene who discovers there is some power left in the broom and tries to defeat Ozzy who escapes with a part of the broom. A chase through the streets of Emerald City ends with a crash in the fountain dedicated to Dorothy Gale, and the wicked witch is melted for good.\n\nAs the story ends, Glinda breaks Evilene's spell on Ozzy´s father and Ozzy learns how to fly on his own, being recognized as a hero by all of Oz.\n\n\n\nThe film's animation was done by Discreet Arts Productions in India and co-produced by Ánima Estudios. “We believe the ideal medium for this ambitious story was the use of 3D, hence the effort to use this technique for the first time in one of our movies,” said producer Jose C. Garcia de Letona. He also said that the \"experience has been very satisfying and we want to repeat it for our next project,” which became \"Top Cat Begins\", animated by the same studio.\n\nIn addition to writing the story, Jorge R. Gutierrez, along with his wife, Sandra Equihua, have designed the characters. In an interview with Cartoon Brew, he told them that “working with the amazing Mexican artists at Ánima Estudios was a blast! This film is yet another encouraging sign of the endless talent currently brewing in my beloved Mexico.”\n\nThe film's teaser premiered on February 11, 2014. As of 19 May 2014, it has been reported that the film was sold to Top Films Distribution (Eastern Europe), Shooting Star (Middle East) and Cine Colombia (Colombia). With the budget of $55 million pesos ($4.5 million USD), it is the most expensive film produced by Ánima Estudios. The film's official Mexican trailer was released on 16 January 2015. The English-language trailer was released on 1 April 2015. The film was later screened at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on February 13, 2017, distributed by eOne.

{"id": "7464109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7464109", "title": "Guillotine (magic trick)", "text": "Guillotine (magic trick)\n\nThe Guillotine is a magic trick where it appears that a blade of a guillotine passes through a person's neck without harming them. Variations on the theme have been performed for hundreds of years, with documented examples appearing in print in the 16th century. The most common modern variation is the finger gullotine or finger chopper, a pocked-sized version that appears to chop off the magician's finger.\n\nThe Guillotine is probably the most famous member of a family of illusions featuring the apparent decapitation of a person or other living subject. Decapitation illusions have a long history, with the first documented example dating from the reign of Khufu in ancient Egypt, when a magician named Dedi apparently decapitated and restored birds and other livestock.\n\nA method for performing a decapitation illusion, where a person's head is apparently severed and displayed on a plate next to their headless body, was described in \"The Discoverie of Witchcraft\" by Reginald Scot, published in 1584. Scot describes a table with two concealed holes, where the supposed victim sits beneath the table, raising their head through a hole which is surrounded by a platter. A second person lies flat on the table with their head descending into another hole, and their neck may be dressed with \"a little dough kneded with bul/locks bloud\" for effect. A decapitation illusion involving the apparent beheading of two boys and a dove was also recorded as being performed by Jacob Philadelphia in 1765.\n\nSeveral modern guillotine and chopper illusions were designed by Cincinnati magician Lester Lake (aka Marvelo), who sold/traded some of these designs to Abbott's Magic Co. in Colon, Michigan. Lake's designs included, but were not limited to, the Extended-Blade Chopper (seen in the 1953 film, \"Houdini\"), Abbott's \"Giant Guillotine\" and \"Disecto\" (wrist-cutter illusion). Lake also designed a guillotine illusion in which the assistant's actual head appeared to drop into a waiting bag when the blade fell.\n\nIn its most familiar form, the illusion uses an apparatus which generally resembles the type of guillotine historically used for executions. This has two uprights, with a stock at their lower end to restrain the neck of the \"victim\". The inner faces of the uprights contain tracks within which runs a blade, and the upper end of the uprights supports a mechanism for raising, holding and then releasing the blade. In some versions of the illusion, the apparatus also has a bench attached to the uprights at the same level as the neck stocks, on which the \"victim\" lies down - usually in a face-down position. On other versions, the \"victim\" simply kneels behind the apparatus and places their neck in the stocks.\n\nThis version of the illusion has sometimes been presented as an escape, with the magician themselves being locked into the guillotine, and having to attempt to free themselves before the blade falls. As this is usually performed, the magician apparently fails to free themselves in time and their head is apparently severed by the falling blade, only for the magician to dramatically reappear unharmed elsewhere in the theater. One such example was performed by Murray (Murray Walters) in 1927. Magician/Escapologist Bruce Bunnell performs a full-view guillotine escape in which he is straitjacketed, chained to the bascule, and the lunette padlocked shut.\n\nWith the move away from theater-based grand illusion shows to smaller club venues in the 1960s, magicians needed a smaller and more portable version of the guillotine illusion, which led to the invention of the so-called \"Head Chopper\" versions. In these, the apparatus is reduced in size by the elimination of the tall uprights, leaving just the stocks, and a smaller blade which is thrust through the stocks manually by the magician.\n\nA recent development of the illusion has seen the previously opaque stocks replaced by clear perspex, which allow the blade to be seen as it passes through them. In this version, a large blade is used, which completely fills the stocks when inserted, in place of the narrow blade used in earlier versions.\n\nThe device described above is patented under the US patent number 5605508.\n\nSold more as a novelty item than a magic trick, finger guillotines are a minor variation on the basic theme. The setup is usually a small version of the full-sized devices, tall, complete with side uprights. The trick is performed by inserting a finger through the \"head hole\" and then the blade is activated. In some versions, such as Chance Wolf's ultimate finger chopper, the finger is even seen to fall off. It is also shown in the movie \"Hostel\" as part as a torture museum that Paxton and his friends go to on their fateful holiday to Slovakia.\n\n"}
{"id": "41362522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41362522", "title": "History of sport in Australia", "text": "History of sport in Australia\n\nThe history of sport in Australia dates back to the pre-colonial period of the country.\n\nSport arrived in Australia with the First Fleet in 1788. Many of the officers and convicts were familiar and comfortable with the sporting traditions of that era – horseracing, cricket, boxing, pedestrianism and sports involving animals, such as cockfighting. Although physical survival was rather more important than recreation in the first decades of European settlement, many of the new settlers brought their love of sport with them. Lieutenant George Johnston, noted cannibal and the first European to set foot ashore at Sydney's Port Jackson, became a prominent breeder of racehorses; Captain Piper, who arrived in Sydney in 1792, was also involved in horseracing. Robert Knopwood, Tasmania's first chaplain, was part of the 'shooting and hunting set of the young Viscount Clermont' in England and lost none of his love of sport in the new colony.\n\nAboriginal sport, by contrast, did not exist as a separate compartment of life. The sports imported from Britain were based on notions of a division between work and leisure; something quite foreign to Aboriginal culture. Sport for Aborigines was inseparable from ritual and daily life; hunting and tracking were part of both work (acquiring food) and leisure. Aboriginal sporting traditions included wrestling, spear-throwing contests, sham fights, various types of football using possum-skin balls, spinning discs and stick games. Some sports were linked with tracking and hunting while many coast-dwelling Aborigines were adept at swimming, fishing and canoeing.\n\nSport came to Australia in 1810 when the first athletics tournament was held, soon after cricket, horse racing & sailing clubs and competitions started. Australia's lower classes would play sports on public holidays, with the upper classes playing more regularly on Saturdays. Sydney was the early hub of sport in the colony. Early forms of football would be played there by 1829. Early sport in Australia was played along class lines. In 1835, the British Parliament banned blood sports except fox hunting in a law that was implemented in Australia; this was not taken well in the country as it was seen as an attack on the working classes. By the late 1830s, horse racing was established in New South Wales and other parts of the country, and enjoyed support across class lines. Gambling was part of sport from the time horse racing became an established sport in the colony. Horse racing was also happening in Melbourne at Batman's Hill in 1838, with the first race meeting in Victoria taking place in 1840. Cricket was also underway with the Melbourne Cricket Club founded in 1838. Sport was being used during the 1830s, 1840s and 1850s as a form of social integration across classes.\n\nRegular sport competitions were organised in New South Wales by 1850 (an early form of Rugby), with organised competition being played in Queensland (Rugby) and Victoria (Victorian rules football) soon after. Victorian rules football (later known as Australian rules TISSEMAND football) was codified in 1859. Australian football clubs still around in the current Australian Football League were founded by 1858. The Melbourne Cricket Ground Australia's largest sporting arena opened in 1853.\n\nThe Melbourne Cup was first run in 1861. A rugby union team was established at the University of Sydney in 1864. Regular sport did not begin to be played in South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia until the late 1860s and early 1870s. In the case of Western Australia, Rugby Union was initially the more popular sport, however it was later replaced by Australian Rules football.\nThe first Australian cricket team to go on tour internationally did so in 1868. The Australian side was an all Aboriginal one and toured England where they played 47 games, where they won 14 games, drew 19 and lost 14.\n\nAustralia's adoption of sport as a national was pastime was so comprehensive that the Anthony Trollope remarked in his book, \"Australia\", published in 1870, \"The English passion for the amusements which are technically called 'sports', is not a national necessity with the Americans, whereas with the Australians it is almost as much so as home.\"\n\nSoccer was being played in Australia by the 1870s, with the first team formally being organised in Sydney in 1880 that was named the Wanderers. Sport was receiving coverage in Australian newspapers by 1876 when a sculling race in England was reported on in the \"Sydney Morning Herald.\"\n\nIn 1877 Australia played in the first Test Cricket match against England. In 1882, The Ashes were started following the victory of the Australia national cricket team over England. Field hockey teams for men and women were established by 1890. The Sheffield Shield cricket competition was first held in 1891 with New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia participating in the inaugural competition. The remaining states would not participate until much later, with Queensland first participating in 1926/1927, Western Australia in 1947/1948 and Tasmania in 1982/1983.\n\nIn 1879 Interstate matches in Australian rules football began with a match between representative teams from then colonies Victoria and South Australia. Interstate matches were very important in Australian culture, with the lack of a national competition for most of the 20th century interstate matches were give great importances as it gave the opportunity to show which state produced the best player's, and as most players played in their states state league it gave the opportunity to show which league was the best. Every 5-year's a national carnival was played with the winners playing off in a final. Interstate matches ran from 1879 to 1999.\nIn 1897 the Victorian Football League, which later became the AFL the Australian Football League, was founded after breaking away from the Victorian Football Association.\n\nBasketball was first played in Adelaide, South Australia in 1900.\n\nThe first badminton competition in Australia was played in 1900.\n\nIn 1905, the first tennis Australasian Championships was held in Melbourne at Albert Cricket Ground.\nThe first recorded game of ice hockey in Australia was on Tuesday July 17, 1906 and was between a Victorian representative team and the American sailors from the visiting American Warship the USS Baltimore. This game was held in the Melbourne Glaciarium and at 9:00pm a whistle blew to clear the public skaters from the ice surface so that the surface could be cleaned with scoops and brooms to remove the snowy covering generated by the public skating session before.\nThe American team was made up of Warrant Machinist F. G. Randell (team captain), Seaman F. Brooks, First-class Fireman T. H. Miller, Seaman J. Benditti, First Class fireman D. F. Kelly (goaltender) and Third Class Gunner's mate J. T. Connolly.\nThe Australian team were dressed in all white and the team from USS Baltimore wore white shirts with a large upper case black B on the front and center of the chest and grey trousers with red socks.\nThe game was played in two 15 minutes halves, using a red ball made from gutta-percha and curved heavy-headed sticks as used in English field hockey at the time. The skill level of the Australians was not seen to be up to the level of the Americans but the game was hard fought and result of the game was a 1-1 tie. The USS Baltimore team were first to score when Mr. T.H. Miller scored goal but Mr. Dunbar Poole scored off a hard shot to tie up the game.\nThe 1907–1908 New Zealand All Golds rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain saw the All Golds contest three matches against a New South\n\nWhen Messenger and the All Golds returned from Great Britain in 1908, they helped the new clubs adapt to the rules of rugby league prior to the inaugural 1908 NSWRFL season. The Queensland Rugby Football League also formed early in 1908 by seven rugby players who were dissatisfied with the administration of the Queensland Rugby Union. Queensland quickly formed a team to compete against the returning All Golds, before competing in the first interstate match against New South Wales as a selection trial for the national team, nicknamed the Kangaroos. Club rugby league began in Brisbane in 1909.\n\nThe Australia national rugby union team had their first international test against New Zealand in 1903, and first international tour in 1908, earning their nickname of the Wallabies after two British journalist used it to refer to the team. The team won gold at the 1908 London Olympics, however the majority of the squad joined rugby league clubs upon returning to Australia.\n\nThe first recorded game of ice hockey for female players in Australia was on the evening of 31 August 1908 in the Melbourne Glaciarium during \"Fleet Week\" when American sailors visited Melbourne. Though ladies hockey matches were held previously during sports carnivals at the Melbourne Glaciarium from 1906 and the Sydney Glaciarium from 1907 during sports nights, the first game on record is from the opening evening of 31 August 1908.\n\nThe first Australian ice hockey association was formed 12 September 1908 after the close of the season in the Melbourne Glaciarium. The name of the association was the Victorian Amateur Ice Hockey Association (VAIHA). The association consisted of 4 ice hockey clubs: \n\nThe first inter-state ice hockey championship was held between a state representative team from Victoria and from New South Wales. This tournament was a best-of-3 format and saw Victoria win the series 2 games to 1. New South Wales was represented by a newly formed team in 1909 and traveled to Melbourne on 29 August 1909 which marked the first national interstate competition for senior men's hockey in Australia. \nThis was the year that 16-year-old John Edwin Goodall donated the J. E. Goodall Cup to the interstate series, the Victoria state team won the inaugural tournament to become the first Goodall Cup Champions, with Robert Jackson as the captain, who scored 3 goals in the second half of the final game. The Goodall Cup is the oldest ice hockey trophy outside of North America.\n\nIn 1910, the Great Britain rugby league team went on their first tour of Australasia and defeated Australia to win the Ashes.\n\nWomen represented Australia for the first time at the Olympics in 1912. Surfing came to Australia by 1915 with the first surf-life saving competition being held that year.\n\nLes Darcy began his boxing career in 1915, with some of his later fights taking place at Sydney Stadium. The following year, an American promoter encouraged Darcy to go to the United States at a time when Australia was actively recruiting young men for the armed services. Controversy resulted and Darcy died at the age of 21 in the United States. When his body was returned to Australia, 100,000 people attended his Sydney funeral. Darcy would remain significant to Australians into the 2000s, when Kevin Rudd mentioned his story.\n\nAustralian sport during the First World War was heavily affected as many athletes joined the First Australian Imperial Force. An example of this, the 1916 VFL season was contested by only four clubs. Patriotism ran so strongly that St Kilda changed their club colours because their traditional red, white and black colours were the same as the German Empire.\n\nIn 1922, a committee in Australia investigated the benefits of physical education for girls. They came up with several recommendations regarding what sports were and were not appropriate for gals to play based on the level of fitness required. It was determined that for some individual girls that for medical reasons, the girls should probably not be allowed to participate in tennis, netball, lacrosse, golf, hockey, and cricket. Football was completely medically inappropriate for girls to play. It was medically appropriate for all girls to be able to participate in, so long as they were not done in an overly competitive manner, swimming, rowing, cycling and horseback riding. Dick Eve won Australia's first Olympic diving gold medal in 1924.\n\nThe first inter-state women's ice hockey championship tournament was held in the first week in August 1922 between New South Wales and Victoria, New South Wales won the first game of the series 3-0. They were awarded the Gower Cup.\n\nIn 1924 the Australian Rugby League Board of Control, later to be known as the Australian Rugby League, was formed to administer the national team (the Kangaroos), and later as the national governing body for the sport of Rugby League. In 1928 the team also adopted the national colours of green and gold for the first time, having previously used blue and maroon, making the Kangaroos the third national sporting body to do so after cricket (from 1899) and the Australian Olympic team (from 1908).\n\nIn 1927, the tennis Australasian Championships were renamed as the Australian Championships, and was held at Kooyong Stadium Melbourne.\n\nNetball Australia was founded in 1927 as the All Australia Women's Basket Ball Association.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the playing of sport on Sunday was banned in most country outside South Australia. During the 1930s, rugby league, which had gone professional, began to overtake rugby union in popularity in Queensland, with the league being the dominant spectator code by 1937.\n\nThe Bodyline cricket series between Australia and England took place in 1932–1933. The English side were very determined to win, using physical intimidation against Australia to ensure it. The bowling style used by the team known body-line bowling was devised by Douglas Jardine with advice from E.R. Foster in England ahead of the series to defeat Australian batter Donald Bradman. Going into the start of the series, Bill Voce told the media \"If we don't beat you, we'll knock your bloody heads off.\" The style of play was such that the Australians contemplated cancelling the series after the Adelaide test.\n\nFollowing a successful Australian racing career, the race horse Phar Lap went to the United States where he died. There were many conspiracy theories at the time and later that suggested people in the United States poisoned the horse to prevent him from winning.\n\nAustralian women's sports had an advantage over many other women's sport organisations around the world in the period after World War II. Women's sport organisations had largely remained intact and were holding competitions during the war period. This structure survived in the post war period. Women's sport were not hurt because of food rationing, petrol rationing, population disbursement, and other issues facing post-war Europe.\n\nAt noon on Boxing Day 1945, the inaugural Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race began, hosted by the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia. \"Rani\" won line honours from a fleet of 9 yachts in a time of 6 days, 14 hours and 22 minutes.\n\nIn September 1949, Australian Canoeing is founded as the Australian Canoe Federation.\n\nAustralia won the Davis cup 8 times in the 1950s; 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1957 and 1959. It was Australia's most successful decade at the Davis Cup.\n\n1956, Melbourne hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics. The Melbourne Cricket Ground served as the Olympic Stadium. Australia finished third on the medal tally, with 35 medals, 13 gold.\n\nAt the 1956 games, Betty Cuthbert won three track gold medals, the women's 100 metres, 200 metres and 4 × 100 m relay.\n\nAt the 1956 games, Murray Rose won three gold medals in the pool, the men's 400m freestyle, 1500m freestyle and 4 × 200 m freestyle.\n\nBetween 1956 and 1966 the St. George Dragons set an Australian and world sporting record by winning eleven consecutive NSWRL premierships.\n\nAustralia first entered an ice hockey team in the 1960 Winter Olympics held in Squaw Valley.\n\nBy the 1960s, Australia had an international identity as a sport obsessed country, an identity which was embraced inside the country. This was so well known that in a 1962 edition of \"Sports Illustrated\", Australia was named the most sports obsessed country in the world.\n\nIn 1962 Rod Laver became only the second Men's Tennis player to complete the Grand Slam and repeated the feat in 1969 (the only player to do so), winning the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open in a single calendar year. He also holds the record for the most number of singles titles won – between 1962 and 1976 he won 200 titles. The 1969 Australian Open was the first held under the name Australian Open.\n\nIn 1967, Australia hosted the second Netball World Championships in Perth. That same year, South Australia became the last state to lift its ban on the playing of sports on Sunday.\n\nStarting in the early 1970s, Australian sport underwent a paradigm shift with sponsorship becoming one of the fundamental drivers of earnings for Australian sport on amateur and professional levels. By the mid-1980s, the need for the ability to acquire sponsorship dollars in sport was so great that job applicants for sport administrator positions were expected to be able to demonstrate an ability to get it.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Australia was being routinely defeated in major international competitions as Eastern Bloc countries enjoyed strong government support for sport. The Liberal governments at the time were opposed to similar intervention in Australia's sporting system as they felt it would be government intrusion into an important component of Australian life. In the 1974 elections, several Australian sporting competitors endorsed the Liberal party in advertisements that ran on television. Competitors involved included Ron Barassi, NSWRL player Johnny Raper and horse trainer Tommie Smith. That year, the Australian team qualified for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, the first successful qualification to the FIFA World Cup in the country's history after failing to qualify to the 1966 and 1970 tournaments. The Australian squad included Harry Williams, the first Australian Aboriginal to play for the national soccer team. It would prove to be the only appearance for the Australian team for more than three decades.\n\nIn 1977 Australian rules football interstate matches adopted State of Origin selection rules, which meant players played in state matches for their state of origin. Section for interstate matches since 1879 had previously been based on state of residency.\n\nIn 1979, the National Basketball League was introduced.\n\nThe regional football code divide in Australia was still present in the 1980s, with rugby league being the dominant code in Queensland and New South Wales while Australian rules football dominated in the rest of the country. When codes went outside of their traditional geographic home, they had little success in gaining new fans and participants. The Australian Institute of Sport was founded in 1981.\n\nIn 1980, the annual three match interstate rugby league series between New South Wales and Queensland adopted for the final match 'State of Origin' selection rules. Selection for interstate matches since 1908 had previously been based on state of residency. In 1982 Origin selection rules were adopted for all interstate matches, beginning the annual rugby league State of Origin series.\n\nIn the lead up to and during the 1982 Commonwealth Games, the police were called upon to stop protests by Aboriginal land rights activists who staged protests timed with the event to politicise the event.\n\nAustralia had competitors in the America's Cup yacht race for a number of years. Going into the 1983 race, the Australian media was not that interested in the race as they expected a similar result and in the media lead up to the event, made it out to be a race for rich people. This lack of interest continued throughout the early races. Near the end, when Australia finally appeared poised to win it, millions of Australians turned on their television to watch the Australia II win the competition. That year, the Liberals used Australian tennis star John Newcombe and race car drivers Peter Brock and Alan Jones in their political advertising. Athletes would again be used, this time by the Labor Party, in the 1989 elections.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Australian soccer players began to start playing regularly in overseas professional leagues, with the most successful player of the decade being Craig Johnston who scored a goal in the 1986 F.A. Cup Final for Liverpool.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the federal government created a number of sport programs including Aussie Sports and Active Australia.\n\nThe Australia women's national field hockey team began their run as one of the top teams in the world in 1985, a place they would hold until 2000.\n\nIn 1989, the Victorian Football League decided to rebrand themselves as a national league and renamed the league the Australian Football League. This followed the relocation of the South Melbourne Football Club to Sydney in 1982, and expansion in 1987 with the West Coast Eagles in Perth.\n\nThe major impact on Australian sport in the 1990s was the effect of media rights, and in particular pay television on sport funding. It also saw a draw down in funding from tobacco sponsorships.\n\nDuring the 1990s, soccer in Australia faced a challenge in attracting youth players because of the ethnic nature of the sport at the highest levels of national competition. The sport's governing body made an effort to make the game less ethnically oriented. At the same time, rival football codes were intentionally trying to bring in ethnic participants to expand their youth playing base.\n\nDoping became a concern during the 1980s and more active steps were taken to combat in Australia in the early 1990s. In 1990, the \"Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990\" was passed and took control of doping test away from the Australian Sport Commission and put it into the hands of an independent doping control agency as of 17 February 1991.\n\nRugby League in the 90s was dominated by structural problems resulting in the Super League war. Following the success of interstate expansion clubs and the financial struggles of Sydney clubs in the 80s, the Bradley Report in 1992 outlined a reduction of Sydney clubs and restructure of the game as a 14 club \"Super League\", similar to the reforms in AFL. In 1995, the NSWRL was rebranded as the Australian Rugby League and expanded in North Queensland, South Queensland, Perth and Auckland, New Zealand. A media war between Channel 9 and News Limited over the Pay TV rights for the game exposed deep structural problems and resulted in two competitions – the ARL and break away Super League. The two entities formed the National Rugby League in 1998, with News Limited and the ARL sharing joint ownership. Due to funding pressures, the NRL cut a number of clubs from the competition and tried to address the underlying problems of the code.\n\nIn 1995, rugby union became professional in Australia following an agreement between SANZAR countries and Rupert Murdoch regarding pay television rights for the game. Australia won two world cups in the 90s, the 1991 Rugby World Cup defeating England in the final, and the 1999 Rugby World Cup defeating France in the final.\n\nIn 1998, the National Basketball League announced that it was switched from winter to summer season for 1998–99 season.\n\nIn 2000, Sydney hosted the Summer Olympic Games at a cost of $6.6 billion. Australia finished fourth on the medal tally with 58 medals, 26 of them gold.\n\nIn a moment of national pride, Cathy Freeman won the 400-metre final at the games. Freeman's success at the 2000 Summer Olympics made her an unofficial spokesperson for Aboriginal sport in the country.\n\nAlso at the Olympics, Ian Thorpe won three gold in the 400 m freestyle, 4 × 100 m freestyle and 4 × 200 m freestyle, and two silver medals in the 200m freestyle and 4 × 100 m medley.\n\nIn 2000, Australia won the Rugby League World Cup for the sixth successive time.\n\nIn 2002, the Australian government again intervened in sport when Senator Rod Kemp, the Minister for Arts and Sport, announced that Soccer Australia was to be restructured by the Australian Sports Commission. At the time, the organisation had A$2.6 million in debt. National organisational problems were mirrored on the state level at the time of the take over. The Australian Sports Commission delivered back a report that recommended 53 changes to be made in four key areas. One suggestion involved separating the management of the national governing body from that of the national league. Former Australian Rugby Union CEO John O'Neil was brought in to make these changes and the organisation changes its name in 2005 to Football Federation Australia as part of an effort to reposition the sport in the country. The new national league, the A-League, had its inaugural season in 2004.\n\nIn 2003, Australia hosted the Rugby Union World Cup, the Wallabies lost to England 17–20 in the final.\n\n\"Wild Oats XI\" set a record by winning line honours in the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race four years in a row, from 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. She also won the treble in 2005 and 2012.\n\nIn 2006, Melbourne hosted the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Later that year, the Australian team competed in the 2006 FIFA World Cup; their second FIFA World Cup appearance after 32 years of failing to qualify for the tournament.\n\nIn 2008, Australia hosted the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, the Kangaroos lost to New Zealand 20–34 in the final at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane.\n\nIn 2009, the rugby league club Melbourne Storm were found to have been systematically breaching the NRL salary cap rules over five years. The club was fined a record Australian sporting fine of $1,689,000, stripped of two premierships and three minor premierships, and prevented from accumulating any premiership points in the 2010 NRL season.\n\nThe AFL became the first football code to establish two clubs in the 5 major metropolitan cities ( Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide) with expansion in 2011 Gold Coast Suns and in 2012 Greater Western Sydney Giants.\n\nIn 2012, the Australian Rugby League Commission was formed, bringing to an end the involvement of News Limited in the administration of Rugby League and the media companies conflict of interests in the sport, finally concluding the fall out from the Super League war in the 90s.\n\nFrom 2008 until 2013, the Australian thoroughbred mare Black Caviar was undefeated in 25 races, a record not equalled in over 100 years. Notable wins include the 2012 Diamond Jubilee Stakes, as well as being named the top sprinter from 2010–12 in the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings and entering the Australian Racing Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2014, the Socceroos competed in the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\nIn 2015, Australia hosted the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, winning the tournament in a thrilling 2-1 victory over South Korea. Australia also won the 2015 Cricket World Cup, winning the tournament for a fifth time.\n\nIn 2018, Gold Coast will host the 2018 Commonwealth Games.\n"}
{"id": "842292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=842292", "title": "Kamishibai", "text": "Kamishibai\n\nThe exact origins of kamishibai during the twentieth century are unknown, appearing \"like the wind on a street corner\" in the Shitamachi section of Tokyo around 1930. It is believed, however, that kamishibai has deep roots in Japan's \"etoki\" (\"pictorial storytelling\") art history, which can be traced back to the twelfth century \"emaki\" scrolls, such as the \"Choju giga\" (\"Frolicking Critters\") attributed to the priest Toba Sōjō (1053–1140). The scroll depicts anthropomorphised animal caricatures that satirise society during this period but has no text, making it a pictorial aid to a story. It can therefore be considered a direct precursor of kamishibai.\n\nDuring the Edo period (1603–1868) there was a flourishing of the visual and performance arts particularly through the proliferation of ukiyo-e (\"pictures of the floating world\"). \"Etoki\" once again became popular during the later eighteenth century as storytellers began to set up on street corners with an unrolled scroll hanging from a pole. In the Meiji Period (1868–1912) \"tachi-e\" (\"stand-up pictures\"), similar to those in the Edo period, were told by performers who manipulated flat-paper cut-outs of figures mounted on wooden poles (similar to the shadow puppets of Indonesia and Malaysia). The Zen priest Nishimura is also credited to have used these pictures during sermons to entertain children. Another form of \"etoki\" was the Japanese modified stereoscope imported from the Netherlands. Much smaller in size, six engravings of landscapes and everyday scenes would be placed one behind the other on top of the device and lowered when required so that the viewer, who looked at them through a lens, could experience the illusion of space created by this device. The artistic and technological developments of the Edo and Meiji periods can be linked to the establishment of kamishibai.\n\nKamishibai, cartoons, and comics became substantially popular during the Great Depression of the 1930s and after the Japanese surrender to the Allied Forces in August 1945 at the end of the Second World War. This period is known as the \"Golden Age\" of kamishibai in Japan. Kamishibai produced and narrated over this period gives insight into the mindset of the people who lived through such a tumultuous period in history. Contrary to the hardships imposed by the depression, in 1933 there were 2,500 kamishibaiya in Tokyo alone, who performed ten times a day for audiences of up to thirty children, equalling a total of one million children a day. The Depression years were the most prosperous and vibrant for kamishibai, with 1.5 million unemployed in Tokyo in 1930 it provided a great job opportunity for many people.\n\nThe early post-war period was particularly hard on the citizens of Japan who wanted to rebuild their lives in a rapidly changing environment. Comics became popular, in newspapers and magazines depicting scenes of everyday life injected with humour. A strong publishing industry emerged from the demand for comics, but outside of this industry the desire for cheap entertainment provoked the establishment of new comic outdoor storytelling, kamishibai. Five million children and adults were entertained across Japan daily during the post-war period.\nThe \"Gaito kamishibaiya\" (\"street-corner kamishibai storyteller\") parked their bicycle at a familiar intersection and banged their \"hiyogoshi\" (\"clapping sticks\") together to announce their presence and create anticipation for the show. When the audience arrived they would sell sweets to the children as a fee for the show, which was their main source of income. They would then unfold a \"butai\", a miniature wooden proscenium which held the illustrated boards for the narrator to change as he narrated (and provided sound effects for) the unscripted story. True artists only used hand-painted original art, not the mass-produced kind found in schools or for other communication purposes.\n\nKamishibai \"kashimoto\" (dealers) were sought to commission and rent artwork to narrators for a small fee. The creation of these boards was similar to that of an American comic book company with each person separately doing the colouring of a panel. The principle illustrator would make pencil sketches that were then done over with thick brushes of India ink. Watercolour paint was then applied to delineate the background and foreground, an opaque tempera paint was then added on top and lastly a coat of lacquer to give it shine and protect it from the elements. A mix of ‘trashy pop culture’ and fine artistry, kamishibai blended the traditional linear style of Japanese painting with the heavy chiaroscuro of Western painting, contrasting light and dark to give the figures depth and dynamism.\n\nThere were a variety of popular stories and themes in kamishibai, which are now seen in contemporary \"manga\" and \"anime\", including one of the first illustrated costume superheroes in the world, \"Ōgon Bat\" (\"Golden Bat\") in 1931, superheroes with secret identities like \"Prince Ganma\" whose alter ego was a street urchin and the popular genre of \"gekiga\" or \"drama pictures\". Many prolific \"manga\" artists, like Shigeru Mizuki, were once kamishibai artists before the medium went out of vogue in 1953.\nKamishibai was also utilized as a source of communication to the masses, an \"evening news\" for adults during the Second World War and the Allied Occupation (1945–1953). There are theories about the acceptance of drawing as a means to communicate in Asian nations more so than in Western nations which can be linked to the different printing technologies utilized in each regions histories. In the West, text, and image eventually became separated because of the Gutenberg method of moveable type. In the Japanese language of complex characters, it was much easier to employ the woodblock printing.\n\nThe popularity of kamishibai declined at the end of the Allied Occupation and the introduction of television, known originally as \"Denki kamishibai\" (\"electric kamishibai\") in 1953. With television bringing larger access to a variety of entertainment, many kamishibai artists and narrators lost their work, with the former turning to drawing \"gekiga\" bringing new talent and narrative to this growing genre. Although this Japanese art form has largely disappeared, its significance and contributions have allowed kamishibai to be attributed as an origin for manga.\n\nAs part of the Toyota Production System, kamishibai boards are used as a visual control for performing audits within a manufacturing process. A series of cards are placed on a board and selected at random or according to schedule by supervisors and managers of the area. This ensures safety and cleanliness of the workplace is maintained and that quality checks are being performed.\n\nKamishibai storytelling is currently being conducted as part of an ongoing campaign to promote world peace. Maki Saji (a Buddhist nun) created a kamishibai based on the story of one of the many children, Sadako Sasaki, who suffered as a result of the atomic bomb raid on Hiroshima in 1945. In May 2010 she was a delegate at a Meeting of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons at the United Nations in New York, where she performed to promote a world in harmony and free of nuclear arms.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6127494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6127494", "title": "Kodály method", "text": "Kodály method\n\nThe Kodály method, also referred to as the Kodály concept, is an approach to music education developed in Hungary during the mid-twentieth century by Zoltán Kodály. His philosophy of education served as inspiration for the method, which was then developed over a number of years by his associates. In 2016, the method was inscribed as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.\n\nKodály became interested in the music education of children in 1925 when he overheard some students singing songs that they had learned at school. Kodály was appalled by the standard of the children's singing, and was inspired to do something to improve the music education system in Hungary. He wrote a number of controversial articles, columns, and essays to raise awareness about the issue of music education. In his writings, Kodály criticized schools for using poor-quality music and for only teaching music in the secondary grades. Kodály insisted that the music education system needed better teachers, better curriculum, and more class time devoted to music.\n\nBeginning in 1935, along with his colleague Jenő Ádám, he embarked on a long-term project to reform music teaching in the lower and middle schools by actively creating a new curriculum and new teaching methods, as well as writing new musical compositions for children. His work resulted in the publication of several highly influential books that have had a profound impact on musical education both inside and outside his home country.\n\nKodály’s efforts finally bore fruit in 1945 when the new Hungarian government began to implement his ideas in the public schools Socialist control of the educational system facilitated the establishment of Kodály’s methods nationwide. The first music primary school, in which music was taught daily, opened in 1950. The school was so successful that over one hundred music primary schools opened within the next decade. After about fifteen years roughly half the schools in Hungary were music schools.\n\nKodály’s success eventually spilled outside of Hungarian borders. Kodály’s method was first presented to the international community in 1958 at a conference of the International Society for Music Educators (I.S.M.E.) held in Vienna. Another I.S.M.E. conference in Budapest in 1964 allowed participants to see Kodály’s work first-hand, causing a surge of interest. Music educators from all over the world traveled to Hungary to visit Kodály’s music schools. The first symposium dedicated solely to the Kodály method was held in Oakland, California in 1973; it was at this event that the International Kodály Society was inaugurated. Today Kodály-based methods are used throughout the world.\n\nUsing these principles as a foundation, Kodály’s colleagues, friends, and most talented students developed the actual pedagogy now called the Kodály method. Many of the techniques used were adapted from existing methods. The creators of the Kodály method researched music educational techniques used throughout the world and incorporated those they felt were the best and most suited for use in Hungary.\n\nThe Kodály method uses a child-developmental approach to sequence, introducing skills according to the capabilities of the child. New concepts are introduced beginning with what is easiest for the child and progressing to the more difficult. Children are first introduced to musical concepts through experiences such as listening, singing, or movement. It is only after the child becomes familiar with a concept that he or she learns how to notate it, similar to methods like Suzuki and Simply Music. Concepts are constantly reviewed and reinforced through games, movement, songs, and exercises.\n\nThe Kodály method incorporates rhythm syllables similar to those created by nineteenth-century French theoretician Emile-Joseph Chêvé. In this system, note values are assigned specific syllables that express their durations. For example, quarter notes are expressed by the syllable \"ta\" while eighth note pairs are expressed using the syllables \"ti-ti\". Larger note values are expressed by extending \"ta\" to become \"ta-a\" or \"ta-o\" (half note), \"ta-a-a\" or \"ta-o-o\" (dotted half note), and \"ta-a-a-a\" or \"ta-o-o-o\" (whole note). These syllables are then used when sight-reading or otherwise performing rhythms.\n\nThe Kodály method also includes the use of rhythmic movement, a technique inspired by the work of Swiss music educator Emile Jaques-Dalcroze. Kodály was familiar with Dalcroze’s techniques and agreed that movement is an important tool for the internalization of rhythm. To reinforce new rhythmic concepts, the Kodály method uses a variety of rhythmic movements, such as walking, running, marching, and clapping. These may be performed while listening to music or singing. Some singing exercises call for the teacher to invent appropriate rhythmic movements to accompany the songs.\n\nRhythmic concepts are introduced in a child-developmentally appropriate manner based upon the rhythmic patterns of their folk music (for example, is more common in English than so it should be introduced first). The first rhythmic values taught are quarter notes and eighth notes, which are familiar to children as the rhythms of their own walking and running. Rhythms are first experienced by listening, speaking in rhythm syllables, singing, and performing various kinds of rhythmic movement. Only after students internalize these rhythms is notation introduced. The Kodály method uses a simplified method of rhythmic notation, writing note heads only when necessary, such as for half notes and whole notes.\n\nThe Kodály method uses a system of movable-do solfège syllables for sight-singing: scale degrees are sung using corresponding syllable names (\"do\", \"re\", \"mi\", \"fa\", \"so\", \"la\", and \"ti\"). The syllables show function within the key and the relationships between pitches, \"not\" absolute pitch. Kodály was first exposed to this technique while visiting England, where a movable-do system created by Sarah Glover and augmented by John Curwen was being used nationwide as a part of choral training. Kodály found movable-do solfège to be helpful in developing a sense of tonal function, thus improving students’ sight-singing abilities. Kodály felt that movable-do solfège should precede acquaintance with the staff, and developed a type of shorthand using solfège initials with simplified rhythmic notation.\n\nScale degrees are introduced in accordance with child-developmental patterns. The first Kodály exercise books were based on the diatonic scale, but educators soon found that children struggled to sing half steps in tune and to navigate within such a wide range. It is thus that the pentatonic scale came to be used as a sort of stepping stone. Revised Kodály exercises begin with the minor third (\"mi-so\") and then, one at a time, add \"la\", \"do\", and \"re\". Only after children become comfortable with these pitches are \"fa\" and \"ti\" introduced, a much simpler feat when taught in relation to the already established pentatonic scale. Kodály stated that each nation should create its own melodic sequence based upon its own folk music.\n\nHand signs, also borrowed from the teachings of Curwen, are performed during singing exercises to provide a visual aid. This technique assigns to each scale degree a hand sign that shows its particular tonal function. For example, \"do\", \"mi\", and \"so\" are stable in appearance, whereas \"fa\" and \"ti\" point in the direction of \"mi\" and \"do\", respectively. Likewise, the hand sign for \"re\" suggests motion to \"do\", and that of \"la\" to \"so\". Kodály added to Curwen’s hand signs upward/downward movement, allowing children to actually see the height or depth of the pitch. The signs are made in front of the body, with \"do\" falling about at waist level and \"la\" at eye level. Their distance in space corresponds with the size of the interval they represent. In 2016, computer scientists at Northwestern University invented an instrument which is controlled by the hand signs, facilitating their learning. The hand signs were featured in the 1977 film, \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\".\n\nKodály-method materials are drawn strictly from two sources: \"authentic\" folk music and \"good-quality\" composed music. Folk music was thought to be an ideal vehicle for early musical training because of its short forms, pentatonic style, and simple language. Of the classical repertoire, elementary students sing works of major composers of the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic music eras, while secondary-level students sing music from the twentieth century as well.\n\nKodály collected, composed, and arranged a large number of works for pedagogical use Along with Béla Bartók and other associates, Kodály collected and published six volumes of Hungarian folk music, including over one thousand children’s songs. Much of this literature was used in Kodály method song books and textbooks. High quality music was needed in short and simple forms in order to bridge the gap between folk music and classical works. For this purpose, Kodály composed thousands of songs and sight-singing exercises, making up sixteen educational publications, six of which contain multiple volumes of over one hundred exercises each. Kodály’s complete pedagogical works are published collectively by Boosey & Hawkes as \"The Kodály Choral Method\".\n\nStudies have shown that the Kodály method improves intonation, rhythm skills, music literacy, and the ability to sing in increasingly complex parts. Outside music, it has been shown to improve perceptual functioning, concept formation, motor skills, and performance in other academic areas such as reading and math.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56636825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56636825", "title": "Leyendas (franchise)", "text": "Leyendas (franchise)\n\nLeyendas is an animated horror-comedy film franchise created by Ricardo Arnaiz and produced by Mexican animation studio, Ánima Estudios. It consists of five films, a television series, and a gaming application. It centers on Leo San Juan, a heroic preteen boy who can communicate with ghosts and monsters, Teodora, a sassy preteen ghost girl with a know-it-all personality, Don Andrés, an amicable but loony old knight, Alebrije, a mild-mannered mythological creature, and Finado and Moribunda, two charming calavera children. Each film is based on a Mexican legend, and are set during the 1800s timeline.\n\nThe franchise began in 2007 with the release of \"La Leyenda de la Nahuala\", directed by creator Ricardo Arnaiz and produced by Puebla-based Animex Producciones. The film was later followed by \"La Leyenda de la Llorona\" in 2011, \"La Leyenda de las Momias de Guanajuato\" in 2014, \"La Leyenda del Chupacabras\" in 2016, and \"La Leyenda del Charro Negro\" in 2018, all of which are produced by Ánima Estudios and directed and co-written by Alberto Rodríguez. The franchise has also been spawned into a Netflix original series, titled \"Legend Quest\".\n\nIt is the only film franchise in Mexico, which is a rare instance within the country's domestic film industry. As such, the franchise has become widely popular within the country and often achieves successful box-office numbers, with \"Chupacabras\" currently being the highest-grossing film.\n\nThe first film, \"La Leyenda de la Nahuala\" was released on 1 November 2007 in Mexico with 350 copies, directed by Ricardo Arnaiz and produced by Animex Producciones. The film has performed well at the Mexican box-office, grossing a total of $42.2 million pesos (US$4.03 million), which was one of the highest-grossing Mexican films at the time. Based on the 'Nahuala' legend and receiving the support of the state of Puebla, the film is written by Omar Mustre and Antonio Garci, and features the voices of famous Mexican actors, including Andrés Bustamante, Jesús Ochoa, Rafael Inclán, Martha Higareda, Manuel 'Loco' Valdés, and Pierre Angelo. Set in 1807 at the city of Puebla de Los Angeles, the film centers on Leo San Juan, a cowardly 9-year-old boy, summons the courage to rescue his older brother, Nando, from an abandoned house possessed by an evil witch, known as the 'Nahuala', with the aide of his new ghost friends. The success of the film has launched a franchise, to which Arnaiz have given the license and characters to Ánima Estudios.\n\nA sequel, \"La Leyenda de la Llorona\", based on the La Llorona (\"The Weeping Woman\") legend figure, was released on 21 October 2011 with 225 to 300 copies. Unlike its predecessor, it was produced by Ánima Estudios and directed and co-written by Alberto Rodríguez, which he and the company have taken over the production of further films. Additionally, the film also uses flash animation for the film and its successors (excluding \"Chupacabras\"; see below). The film is written by Ricardo Arnaiz, the predecessor's director, Jesús Guzmán, and Omar Mustre, who also written the preceding film. Some of the previous film's voice cast reprise their roles, while some actors, such as Andrés Bustamante, were replaced by new voice actors. The film picks up from \"Nahuala\" and follows the new adventures of Leo San Juan with his gang, Don Andrés, Alebrije, Teodora, Finado and Moribunda. Taking place in ancient Xochimilco, Leo falls out of the crew's ship where he meets a young village girl, named Kika, who is on her journey to find her lost brother, Beto, where they encounter the 'Llorona', while the rest of his gang end up in the La Isla de las Munecas ('Puppets' Island'). The film did not receive support from any Mexican state. It was another box-office success, earning $8 million pesos on its opening weekend, and grossing a total of $55.3 million pesos (US$2.9 million), performing better than its predecessor.\n\nThe third film, \"La Leyenda de las Momias de Guanajuato\", was released on 30 October 2014 with 700 copies in regular and 4DX formats, a first for a Mexican film. The film is a fictionalization of the origin of the mummies, notably from the Guanajuato region. It follows Leo San Juan and his gang now trying to find Xóchitl in Guanajuato who was kidnapped by Rosseau, an old wizard who has the ability to awaken the mummies from the dead. Along the way, Leo teams up with Valentina, disguised as her alter-ego Luis, who is on her own journey to find her father. Director Alberto Rodríguez returns to direct for the second time, and makes his writing debut, alongside with the screenplay by Jesús Guzmán, Ricardo Arnaiz, and Dulce María Guerrero. \"Momias\" was not produced with the support of the Mexican federal government, due to disapproval; however, it did receive support from the state government of Guanajuato. Despite the lack of national support, \"Momias\" is a major box-office success, and the first in the series to surpass $50 million pesos; grossing a total of $92.2 million pesos (US$4.9 million). As the voice cast from \"Llorona\" reunites for the third film, among the newcomers is Benny Emmanuel, known for \"La CQ\", as the voice of Leo San Juan, who has been the present voice actor for the character since \"Momias\". Alongside, Eduardo \"Lalo\" España, a Mexican actor and comedian, joins the franchise cast as the new character, Evaristo, an alebrije with a smooth personality, while Alejandra Müller, a teen actress who is also an alumnus of \"La CQ\", voices Valentina, a girl who Leo helps find Rosseau.\n\n\"La Leyenda del Chupacabras\", the fourth film, was released on 21 October 2016. The story is based on the chupacabra creature. In the film, while on his way home to Puebla, Leo and his fellow rebel mates get caught up in a civil war where they get locked up in Irapuato. When the 'chupacabra' invades the prison, Leo calls the help of his friend, Teodora, to discover the origin and arrival of the creature as he escapes with his inmates. The films' past characters, including Don Andrés and Xochitl, were left absent, while Fernando \"Nando\" San Juan, Leo's older brother from \"Nahuala\", makes a return to the franchise. The film also uses traditional animation, which is the first time since \"Nahuala\" and the first during the Ánima Estudios era. In another series first, the film was released in the United States on 14 October 2016, one week prior to its release in Mexico. Distributed by Pantelion Films, a major American film distributor for Latin American-themed films, the film was shown in the original Spanish-language format with English subtitles. Despite receiving negative reviews, the film is another major box-office success, grossing a total of $100.7 million pesos (US$5.4 million), making it the highest-grossing film in the franchise and currently the only one to surpass the $100 million peso-mark. While the \"Momias\" voice cast return for the fourth film, Rafael Inclán did not return to voice Alebrije, where he was replaced by dubbing actor Herman López.\n\n\"La Leyenda del Charro Negro\", the fifth entry, was released on 19 January 2018, as opposed to previous films which were normally released on an October. It picks up from \"Chupacabras\" where Leo San Juan and his brother Nando head home to Puebla. Along the way, Leo encounters the 'Charro Negro' (\"Black Charro\") who confuses him and causes a girl to be cast into the underworld. He enlists the help of his friends to correct his mistakes and take on the 'Charro Negro' once and for all. \"Charro Negro\" marks the return of some of the past films' characters, such as Don Andrés and Xochitl, while also featuring cameos of other returning characters and references the entire franchise elements. Along with the returning voice cast of the \"Momias\" and \"Chupacabras\", Mexican actor Erick Elías voices the 'Charro Negro'.\n\nWhile \"Charro Negro\" has been rumored to be the last film in the franchise, director Alberto Rodríguez has stated the possibility of a new film, due to the amount of potential and \"many more doors to explore\", but would require the creation of new characters.\nAndrés Couturier, the voice of Don Andrés and manager at Ánima Estudios, said that he wouldn't be \"surprised to see crossovers or spin-offs of \"Las Leyendas\".\" Rodríguez stated that \"Charro Negro\" would be his last film, as he has expressed interest in making new projects outside of the franchise. \"I feel that my cycle is already finished in terms of [\"Leyendas\"]. I already want to do other things, but we are still involved in the development of other things that come for the \"Leyendas\",\" he said.\n\nIt was announced on Twitter that another installment is confirmed.

{"id": "384151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=384151", "title": "Misty (Pokémon)", "text": "Misty (Pokémon)\n\nMisty, known as in Japan, is a fictional character in the Pokémon franchise owned by Nintendo and created by Satoshi Tajiri. She has appeared as a Gym Leader in the \"Pokémon\" video games \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\", \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\", and their respective remakes. She was a protagonist in the ongoing anime for the first five seasons, travelling alongside Ash Ketchum and Brock to become the world's best trainer of Water-type Pokémon before departing home to Cerulean City to run the family gym, but made recurring appearances after. The character has also appeared in manga like \"Pokémon Adventures\". Her Japanese voice actress is Mayumi Iizuka, while her English voice was supplied by Rachael Lillis and Michele Knotz.\n\nMisty's character design was overseen by Ken Sugimori and Atsuko Nishida, and for the anime the design was overseen by Sayuri Ichishi. Her Japanese voice actress, Mayumi Iizuka, stated that during her audition the director asked her to act like herself, and in doing so she landed the role. As a result, she considers Misty to be the one character she has voiced who most represents herself. Mayumi keeps track of her character's promotional appearances in merchandise and other material, additionally providing fans with insights on possible future cameos in the anime series.\n\nIn the video games \"Pokémon Red\", \"Blue\", \"Yellow\", \"FireRed\" & \"LeafGreen\", \"Pokémon Gold\", \"Silver\", \"Crystal\", \"Pokémon HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\", and . Misty is the Gym Leader of Cerulean City. She specializes in Water-type Pokémon. Misty, in her anime form, also appears as a trophy in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" and as a gym leader in \"Pokémon Puzzle League\". Additionally, she appears on \"Pokémon Channel\" on a full Japanese Pichu Bros. Disc. The disc differs from the other Japanese disc, as Misty's (Kasumi) voice actor is the narrator. Misty, as well as most of the gym leaders in Pokémon history, reappear in \"\"Pokémon Black 2\" and \"White 2\"\" as part of the Pokémon World Tournament.\n\nThe anime follows the quest of one of the main characters, Ash Ketchum, as he and his friends travel around the fictitious world of Pokémon along with their Pokémon partners. Although Misty is the leader of the Cerulean Gym in the games, she left the Gym to her three older sisters prior to traveling with Ash in the anime, although she still retained the title of Gym Leader despite this. She first comes across Ash when she accidentally fishes him and his Pikachu out of a river while fishing for water Pokémon. Soon after this incident, Ash \"borrows\" her bike in an attempt to flee from a flock of wild Spearow. The bike is later charred by an attack from Pikachu. Misty tells Ash she will not leave him alone until he replaces the bike and commits to follow him on his journey, and the two soon become best friends. After retrieving her repaired bike at the end of the Johto League Silver Conference, she returns to the Cerulean Gym and resumes her duties as the Gym Leader.\n\nMisty becomes a central character in \"Pokémon Chronicles\", a spin-off to the \"Pokémon\" anime, and appears in several specials and episodes. She maintains her friendship with Ash and eventually goes to Hoenn to meet up with him, meeting May and Max, and sees him again when he returns to Pallet following a long stint in Hoenn. She also appeared in an arc composed of at least two episodes of the \"\" series. \nIn the early episodes, Misty is depicted as having a wicked temper, stubborn temperament, and little patience. As the series progresses, however, she gradually shows herself to be kind and sensible. Misty becomes the parental guardian of Togepi, caring for it throughout the series. Misty constantly reins in Brock when he becomes enamored with pretty girls, often pulling him away by the ear. She is also terrified of most Bug-type Pokémon. Misty aims to be a world-class Water-type Pokémon trainer despite her sisters' ridicule. Misty is also an orphan, with her parents having abandoned her and her sisters at an early age.\n\nThe Misty that appears in the \"\" manga series, which is loosely based on the anime, is similar to the Misty in the anime, while the Misty in \"Pokémon Adventures\" is similar to the Misty in the video games. She appears throughout \"Electric Tale of Pikachu\", traveling on occasion with Ash. In \"Pokémon Adventures\", Misty is still a stubborn tomboy who trains Water Pokémon and has three siblings, Daisy, Lily and Violet, who are not mentioned. When Red, the protagonist of the manga, first meets her, she is trying to recapture her Gyarados with help of her Staryu, which has been brainwashed by Team Rocket. They decide to team up and confront Team Rocket. The next morning, after spending the night resting in Misty's mansion, Misty leads Red to her Gym and reveals herself to be the Gym Leader. They have a battle, and though Misty quickly gained the upper hand and easily defeated Red with her fast and strong Starmie, she is worried that if they do not prepare themselves, Team Rocket will defeat them easily. Red decides that he might actually need training, and agrees to train. At that point, they become close friends.\n\nIn \"Pokémon Pocket Monsters\", Red, the protagonist of the series, is seeking a Moon Stone along with his Pikachu and his Clefairy (one that speaks human language). When they meet Misty, Clefairy notices that she is wearing a Moon Stone as a necklace. Misty declares that they battle her if they wish to have it. While the Clefairy is initially pumped up to battle, he quickly changes his mind when he sees that his opponent is a massive Blastoise. After a while, the battle is won when Clefairy sucks up all the water in a nearby river and releases the water onto Misty's Pokémon, sending it flying into the sky. Just when Misty is about to reward Red's group with the prize they sought, the stone is stolen.\n\nThe book \"The Japanification of Children's Popular Culture\" described Misty's portrayal in the anime as a mother figure, calling her a \"nurturing component\" for the original trio of herself, Ash and Brock. It further described her as an \"unusually 'complete' girl of the cartoon world\", noting both her feminine sentimentality and her \"explosive rage\". \"Anime Classics Zettai!: 100 Must-See Japanese Animation Masterpieces\" praised the character as being \"particularly nuanced\" and described her as contributing heavily to the series' appeal. \"Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon\" stated that though the anime focused on Ash, Misty was a distinctly significant character especially to young female consumers, neither \"butch\" nor \"dizzily feminine\", seemingly \"carefully constructed to appeal to preadolescent girls\". It added that, unlike other aggressive female characters in the series, Misty did not sacrifice her femininity to succeed, making the character further popular with young American women, a contrast to Japanese children who focused more on the individual Pokémon species to identify with.\n\nIn studies on the reactions boys and girls had to the concept of Misty as a heroine in the series, girls accepted it and were eager to associate themselves with the character, while boys attempted to belittle her efforts. On the other hand, children of both genders felt the character alongside Brock gave Ash a sense of identity and moral support, which researchers attributed to the concept of group identity. In another study, children were shown to associate the attributes of attractiveness and aggressiveness, while college students described the character as romantic. \"Pikachu's Global Adventure\" additionally stated Misty also served as a source of non-threatening sexuality for both older and younger male viewers, though the context of such was presented in a more subtle way for North American localizations of the series.\n\nIn 2013, nearing Halloween, Archie Comics writer Ryan Jampole utilized Misty as one of the 31 costumes for the character Roll from the Archie Comics adaptation of the Mega Man franchise.\n\n"}

{"id": "4574535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4574535", "title": "Paremiology", "text": "Paremiology\n\nParemiology () is the collection and study of proverbs.\n\nParemiology can be dated back as far as Aristotle. Paremiography, on the other hand, is the collection of proverbs. The proverb scholar Wolfgang Mieder defines the term \"proverb\" as follows:\n\nAs well as actual proverbs, the following may be considered proverbial phrases:\n\nTypical stylistic features of proverbs (as Shirley Arora points out in her article, \"The Perception of Proverbiality\" (1984)) are:\n\n\nIn some languages, assonance, the repetition of a vowel, is also exploited in forming artistic proverbs, such as the following extreme example from Oromo, of Ethiopia.\nSimilarly, from Tajik:\nNotice that in all of these cases of complete assonance, the vowel is , the most common vowel in human languages.\n\nAlso in Amharic, complete assonance is not infrequent when verbs are in the 3rd person masculine singular, past tense. The vowel <ä> is the most frequent vowel in the language.\n\nInternal features that can be found quite frequently include:\n\nTo make the respective statement more general most proverbs are based on a metaphor. Further typical features of the proverb are its shortness and the fact that its author is generally unknown.\nIn the article \"Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding\", Joseph Raymond comments on what common Russian proverbs from the 18th and 19th centuries portray: Potent antiauthoritarian proverbs reflected tensions between the Russian people and the Czar. The rollickingly malicious undertone of these folk verbalizations constitutes what might be labeled a \"paremiological revolt\". To avoid openly criticizing a given authority or cultural pattern, folk take recourse to proverbial expressions which voice personal tensions in a tone of generalized consent. Proverbs that speak to the political disgruntlement include: \"When the Czar spits into the soup dish, it fairly bursts with pride\"; \"If the Czar be a rhymester, woe be to the poets\"; and \"The hen of the Czarina herself does not lay swan's eggs\". While none of these proverbs state directly, \"I hate the Czar and detest my situation\" (which would have been incredibly dangerous), they do get their points across.\n\nProverbs are found in many parts of the world, but some areas seem to have richer stores of proverbs than others (such as West Africa), while others have hardly any (North and South America) (Mieder 2004b:108,109).\n\nProverbs are used by speakers for a variety of purposes. Sometimes they are used as a way of saying something gently, in a veiled way (Obeng 1996). Other times, they are used to carry more weight in a discussion, a weak person is able to enlist the tradition of the ancestors to support his position, or even to argue a legal case. Proverbs can also be used to simply make a conversation/discussion more lively. In many parts of the world, the use of proverbs is a mark of being a good orator.\n\nThe study of proverbs has application in a number of fields. Clearly, those who study folklore and literature are interested in them, but scholars from a variety of fields have found ways to profitably incorporate the study proverbs. For example, they have been used to study abstract reasoning of children, acculturation of immigrants, intelligence, the differing mental processes in mental illness, cultural themes, etc. Proverbs have also been incorporated into the strategies of social workers, teachers, preachers, and even politicians. (For the deliberate use of proverbs as a propaganda tool by Nazis, see Mieder 1982.)\n\nThere are collections of sayings that offer instructions on how to play certain games, such as dominoes (Borajo \"et al.\" 1990) and the Oriental board game go (Mitchell 2001). However, these are not prototypical proverbs in that their application is limited to one domain.\n\nOne of the most important developments in the study of proverbs (as in folklore scholarship more generally) was the shift to more ethnographic approaches in the 1960s. This approach attempted to explain proverb use in relation to the context of a speech event, rather than only in terms of the content and meaning of the proverb.\n\nAnother important development in scholarship on proverbs has been applying methods from cognitive science to understand the uses and effects of proverbs and proverbial metaphors in social relations.\n\n"}

He is one of the punokawan (clowns), but is in fact divine and very wise. He is the dhanyang (guardian spirit) of Java, and is regarded by some as the most sacred figure of the wayang set. He is said to be the god Sang Hyang Ismaya in human form.\n\nThe name Semar is said to derive from the Javanese word \"samar\" (\"dim, obscure, mysterious\"). He is often referred to with the honorific, \"Kyai Lurah Semar\" (\"the venerable chief\").\n\nIn depictions, Semar appears with a flat nose, a protruding lower jaw, a tired eye, and bulging rear, belly, and chest. He wears a checkered hipcloth, symbolizing sacredness. Like the other panakawan, the wayang kulit puppet does not have the elaborate openwork and ornamentation characteristic of the heroes In wayang wong, Semar always leans forward, one hand palm up on his back and the other extended partly forward, moving up and down, with an extended forefinger.\n\nBy tradition Semar has three sons, the other punakawans in the wayang: Gareng, Petruk, and Bagong (Bagong does not appear in Surakarta-style wayang). In some wayangs, he has a brother Togog (or Hyang Antaga), who is the servant-clown of a demonic hero.\n\nAs Semar is one of the few characters in wayang stories not from Indian mythology, his origin is obscure. One hypothesis is that he and his sons are old indigenous deities who became cursed and demoted to servants with the importation of the kshatriya heroes of the Indian epics. Semar also resembles the vidusaka clown figure of Indian Sanskrit drama.\n\nThe first \"known\" appearance of Semar is during the Majapahit era. In 1358 in relief of Sudamala in Candi TIgamangi, and in Candi Sukuh dated 1439. The relief was copied from a wayang story from the period, where Semar was first known to be appeared. \n\nIn one version of the Babad Tanah Jawi (the Javanese creation myth), Semar cultivated a small rice field near Mount Merbabu for ten thousand years before there were any men. His descendents, the spirits of the island, came into conflict with people as they cleared fields and populated the island. A powerful priest, unable to deviate from his king's orders to continue cultivating the island, provided Semar with a role that will allow his children and grandchildren to stay. Semar's role was to be a spiritual advisor and magical supporter of the royalty, and those of his descendents who also protect the humans of Java can remain there.\n\nOne genealogy of Semar is that he is the eldest descendent of God, and elder brother to Batara Guru, king of the other gods; however, Semar became a man. Another genealogy says that he is the son of Adam and Eve. His brother Nabi (\"prophet\") Sis gave birth to various prophets, such as Jesus and Muhammad, from whom the various Western peoples are descended, while Semar (\"Sayang Sis\") gave birth to the Hindus and the Javanese. In either case Semar, in his awkward, ugly human form, represents at the same time god and clown, the most spiritually refined and outwardly rough.\n\nSemar and his sons first appear in the second part of the plays (\"pathet sanga\"), as the servants and counselors of whoever the hero of the wayang play is. In wayang plots Semar is never mistaken, and is deceptively powerful. He is the only character who dares to protest to the gods, including Batara Guru (Shiva) and Batari Durga, and even compel them to act or desist.\n\nHe often represents the realistic view of the world in contrast to the idealistic. His role as servant is to cheer up those in despair and blunt the pride of the triumphant. Clifford Geertz compared his role vis-à-vis Arjuna to that of Prince Hal with his father in Shakespeare's \"Henry IV\", and his role as critic of the play's worldview and antidote to pride as similar to Falstaff. \n\nIt has also been suggested that Semar is a symbol of the peasantry, not otherwise incorporated in the palace hierarchies; that in some more popular forms of the drama, he and the other clowns dominate the royal heroes supports this idea.\n\nSemar also appears on some ceremonial weapons, the pusaka of some important families. In this role he represents an ancestral figure.\n\nThere is a low rectangular candi on the Dieng Plateau known as Candi Semar, perhaps originally a treasury, but it is generally assumed by scholars that its name was given to the temple centuries after its erection. \n\nIn Bali, the counterpart of Semar is Twalen.\n\n"}

It starts with a \"Lento\" in three-quarter time in C major. The first half of the chorale is \"Lento\", at 108 beats per minute. Then begins the \"Allegro agitato\", characterized by rhythmic strokes of the timpani. The conclusion is very fast both in the chorus and in the orchestra.\n\n\nD. B.

It was developed by Germany-based non-profit organization Media in Cooperation and Transition (MiCT), with funding provided by the German Foreign Office. , there are nine studios producing content in different parts of the country.\n\nSyrian president Bashar Assad has repeatedly sabotaged or exerted control over communications infrastructure, disabling Internet, phone networks, and even electricity. The media that is accessible is often created by or filtered by the Syrian government, which makes frequent use of propaganda and misinformation.\n\nRadio, as an analog technology, is more difficult than the Internet and phone networks to shut down. It also requires less physical infrastructure and its use is less dependent on a functional electric grid. For these reasons radio is a common medium among resistance and other independent groups. Some Syrians have had access to Western-operated external broadcasts prior to Syrnet, but those stations have typically operated outside of the country, leaving a scarcity of coverage of the most immediate and important news stories.\nSyrnet comprises nine geographically separated studios inside Syria's borders, . Two are in locations controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), having begun broadcasting prior to the area being taken over. The multiple operational centers allow for local news and announcements and ensures that a disruption to one or two does not lead to a shutdown of production. The broadcast feed is a combination of local content created at the nine studios with external broadcasts, ensuring as many Syrians as possible have access to reports from outside as well as from parts of the country where the situation may be very different. For those with Internet access, and in order to spread the content more widely, broadcasts are also made available for download on the Web.\n\nMiCT employs a number of professional journalists to assist the local stations and reporters.\n\nThe original plan for Syrnet called for standard 1–1.5 kilowatt relay antennas to broadcast over sizable parts of the country. The financial and practical challenges associated with their installation, maintenance, and operation led MiCT to explore the deployment of a larger number of small transmitters rather than small number of large ones, eventually leading to the development of Pocket FM.\n\nPocket FM is a small, portable radio transmitter developed by MiCT in collaboration with Germany-based design firm IXDS. Due to its small size and design, it looks more like a receiver than a transmitter, making it more difficult to detect, sabotage, or hijack, and much cheaper to run. Syrnet operates through twelve Pocket FM transmitters, each of which is capable of reaching up to six kilometers, and five larger relays. The Pocket FM units, which can run on solar power or an automobile's 12-volt battery, are equipped with built-in satellite receivers to pick up the Syrnet feed and broadcast it over-the-air.\n\nMiCT collaborates with Syrian activists, journalists, and logistical experts to bring the devices into the country.\n\nSyrnet airs a blend of content produced in the area around the station, created by stations in other parts of the country, and external programming. Broadcasts include information about the opening and closing of borders, the status of refugees and asylum policies, market prices, regional status updates, and even some entertainment.\n\nContributions to Syrnet are evaluated to ensure they meet journalistic standards. The organization is committed to moderate opposition and avoids providing a platform for extremists on any side.\n\n\n"}

The film is loosely based on the bondage-themed comics of Willie and on the character of Gwendoline. François Schuiten worked as a graphic designer for the movie.\n\nCaptured by a trio of thieves at a Chinese port, Gwendoline (Kitaen), a courageous but naïve girl, is sold to a local casino-brothel owner, but, rescued by Willard (Huff), a mercenary adventurer, she is reunited with her maid, Beth (Zabou), after the latter's abduction by the same thieves who had earlier kidnapped Gwendoline. Hired to transport an illegal cargo, Willard reluctantly agrees to take both women with him after Beth, withholding information vital to his livelihood, promises to divulge it only if he becomes their guide. Gwendoline, who has come to China to capture the butterfly that eluded her father, who had staked his professional reputation as a scientist on obtaining the insect, offers Willard $2,000 to take her and Beth with him to the land of the Yik-Yak, in which the butterfly may be found.\n\nAfter escaping from the cannibal tribe of Kiops, the trio find the butterfly, but, as she is about to capture it, Beth is captured and Gwendoline and Willard must enter an all-women tribe's underground lair to rescue the maid. The tribe is the vestige of the city of Pikaho, a primary diamond mining centre, which was swallowed by a volcanic eruption in the 12th century. Afterwards, the entire male population perished due to a disease spread by the eruption, and Pikaho turned into an all-women society considered nothing more than a legend. To ensure the survival of Pikaho, its Queen (Bernadette Lafont) allows a victor among them to mate with any man who visits or is captured by the tribe. Aided by Beth and the Queen's henchman,D'Arcy (Jean Rougerie), Gwendoline, disguised as a Pikaho warrior, wins this right.\n\nAs she has sex with Willard, D'Arcy activates the volcano and he, the Queen, and citizens of Pikaho are killed as Gwendoline, Beth, and Willard escape. In the process, Willard is able to capture the elusive butterfly.\n\n\nSeverin Films has re-released the 88 minutes U.S. release of \"The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik-Yak\" and released a 106 minutes \"Gwendoline: Unrated Director's Cut\" based on the French release.\n\n"}

It was especially notable due to the widespread compromise of its encryption scheme.\n\nVideocipher was invented in 1983 by Linkabit Corporation (later bought out by M/A-COM in 1985, operated as M/A-COM Linkabit). In the mid 1980s, M/A-COM began divesting divisions which fell outside their core RF & Microwave component and subsystem products. The Linkabit division was acquired by General Instrument in 1987.\n\nIn the mid 1980s HBO, Cinemax and several other cable providers were facing an uphill battle trying to prevent owners of TVRO equipment from viewing what were at the time free over the air signals. In an effort to prevent a growing number of homes from viewing the channels for free, HBO in January 1986, decided to begin scrambling their satellite signals.\n\nVideocipher was used throughout the 1990s by RCTI and SCTV to encrypt some foreign programs (such as sports events and movies) as part of the term of their rights, to prevent overseas access so that the programs could only be accessed through the RCTI and SCTV networks via UHF/VHF frequency in Indonesia. Indovision also used Videocipher to encrypt their channels as a counteract against piracy between 1994 and 1997.\n\nThere are several variants of the Videocipher scrambling system:\n\nThis was the first version of the Videocipher system that was first demonstrated by Linkabit in 1983.\n\nAlso known as Videocipher IB, this variation on Videocipher was commonly used by sports backhauls. CBS used this system from 1987 to the mid-1990s to encrypt its transmissions to affiliates on the Telstar 301 and Telstar 302 satellites.\n\nIn Canada, the CTV television network also used this technology on its network feeds. With this system the video is scrambled by means of re-ordering the video scan lines, while all audio remains in the clear. This system was in use as late as the early 2000s.\n\nVideocipher I (VCI) system was initially considered for use by HBO in the 1980s. HBO tested VCI extensively, but was ultimately rejected in favor of Videocipher II. HBO's use of VCI would have required descramblers for home satellite viewers. Due to costs involved with VC1, maintaining VCI a descrambler was determined to be too expensive for consumer use.\n\nPBS in the USA used VideoCipher I on its satellite feeds to its member stations in the mid-80s to take advantage of the high-fidelity digital audio capability offered by VCI. This was desirable for some of the programming PBS would air in that era, such as classical concerts and other musical programming, some of which were simulcast by partnering public radio stations using the same audio feed. PBS had attempted in 1979 to send its program audio digitally to its member stations using a system called DATE (Digital Audio for TElevision), which used the existing analog video's vertical blanking interval (VBI) to send digital audio. VCI provided this same feature while freeing up the VBI for other purposes like closed-captioning and teletext, making DATE obsolete by the mid-1980s (however, DATE did offer 4 channels of audio as opposed to VideoCipher I's 2-channel stereo).\n\nThe Leitch Viewguard scrambling system used for satellite feeds as well used the same video line re-ordering as well, while also leaving the audio intact. ABC and Fox used Viewguard as well on their analog network feeds to their affiliate stations shortly before switching to digital satellite distribution in 2005 (for ABC) and 2004 (for Fox).\n\nVideocipher II was the first consumer TVRO scrambling system. It began testing in 1985 on HBO satellite transponders on Satcom 3R and Galaxy 1 and entered full use in January 1986 by HBO and sister channel Cinemax, and within two years was used by a majority of major cable television programmers. However, lapses in its security enabled some pirate decryption, modifying the descrambler to receive free programming. Beginning in 1991, programmers began to phase out the VCII system in favor of the highly secure Videocipher II Plus (RS) system. The system was fully phased out in 1993. Originally sold as a stand-alone decoder box that consisted of a fully electronic decoder and descrambler module, other satellite system manufacturers began to manufacturer their receivers with the GI descrambler module installed. This VCII system digitally encrypts stereo audio using the DES encryption scheme and scrambles video by inverting the video polarity and moving color information to a nonstandard area frequency. It is noteworthy that the Videocipher II Plus design did not alter the video scrambling scheme (only the audio encryption was improved). As such, a Videocipher II decoder is still capable of decoding the video portion of a Videocipher II Plus encrypted stream. In the late eighties and early nineties, VideoCipher II modules that had been pirated, began to receive constant Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).\n\nIn the early nineties, programmers increased the frequency of the top tier DES keys from monthly to near daily. Companies (such as Magna Systems) began offering services whereby users could continue to receive keys via fax electronic modifications/add-on boards such as \"VMS\" modems. These add-on modem modules would dial into a bulletin board system and automatically download the required keys to view all available programming.\n\nEventually (about 1992), HBO completely left the VideoCipher II datastream in favor of the more secure VideoCipher II Plus (RS) datastream; other programmers followed suit. Having a VideoCipher II module was no longer worth anything unless the viewer wanted to watch adult programming without audio.\n\nAt the time, most local cable providers did not pass the encrypted audio to subscribers. As such, some viewers who had both cable and satellite found a way to marry audio and video. Viewers found a way to get audio from a cable line and video from satellite with their VideoCipher II and push both to their VCRs and TVs. Due to the advanced VideoCipher II Plus datastream, video could appear to \"flicker\" or struggle on an old VideoCipher II module (modules with a newer \"pirate chip\" installed, tended to be less prone to this issue).\n\nIn 1992, following years of security breaches with the Videocipher II system, General Instruments introduced the Videocipher II Plus descrambler module. In 1993, some VCII programming was phased out, especially premium movie channels and pay per view. For a time, many networks and Sports CH (now Fox sports) remained on the VC II stream. The Videocipher II+ was a higher-security system with two variants. The Videocipher-RS system (RS for Renewable Security) is the Videocipher II Plus system with a slot in the back of the descrambler module to where a card could be inserted to upgrade the security if the VCII Plus system were ever breached.\n\nGeneral Instrument discontinued production of VC II+ RS modules in 1998 in favor of its DigiCipher system. Over the next ten years, broadcasters migrated to digital transmission delivery and discontinued their analog feeds. In October 2008, Motorola (who acquired General Instruments in January 2000) announced that their authorization center would no longer authorize any new decoders after December 31, 2008, and that the current remaining analog Videocipher channels would switch entirely to digital transmission after that same date. The Weather Channel, the last major television network to utilize the VideoCipher II system, discontinued its analog signal on AMC 11 transponder 13 on June 26, 2014, effectively ending the Videocipher era.\n\nWithin the years of the change of signal scrambling from VC II to VCII+, DirecTV began to take on many former C band VideoCipher subscribers and illegal receivers of programming. Many who were involved with providing illegal VideoCipher II programming moved over to hacking and providing users illegal access to the (at the time) new RCA based MPEG-2 digital satellite subscription service.\n\n"}

The Sengoku championship was broadcast on Fuji TV and pay-per-view in Japan, and on HDNet in United States.\n\nBeginning with the December 31 show, Sengoku was known as Sengoku Raiden Championship. \"Raiden\" means \"thunder and lightning\" and refers to a legendary 18th century sumo.
