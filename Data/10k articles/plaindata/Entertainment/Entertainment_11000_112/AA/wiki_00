{"id": "35937111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35937111", "title": "2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony", "text": "2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n\nThe opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympic Games took place on the evening of Friday 27 July 2012 in the Olympic Stadium, London. As mandated by the Olympic Charter, the proceedings combined the formal ceremonial opening of this international sporting event (including welcoming speeches, hoisting of the flags and the parade of athletes) with an artistic spectacle to showcase the host nation's culture. The 2012 Games were formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II. The spectacle was entitled Isles of Wonder and directed by Academy Award-winning British film director Danny Boyle.\n\nPrior to London 2012 there had been considerable apprehension about Britain's ability to stage an opening ceremony that could reach the standard set at the Beijing Summer Games of 2008. The 2008 ceremony had been noted for its scale, extravagance and expense, hailed as the \"greatest ever\", and had cost £65m. In contrast, London spent an estimated £27m (out of £80m budgeted for its four ceremonies), which was nevertheless about twice the original budget. Nonetheless, the London opening ceremony was immediately seen as a tremendous success, widely praised as a \"masterpiece\" and \"a love letter to Britain\".\n\nThe ceremony began at 21:00 BST and lasted almost four hours. It was watched by an estimated worldwide television audience of 900 million, becoming the most-viewed Olympic opening ceremony in both the UK and US. The content had largely been kept secret before the performance, despite involving thousands of volunteers and two public rehearsals. The principal sections of the artistic display represented Britain's Industrial Revolution, National Health Service, literary heritage, popular music and culture, and were noted for their vibrant storytelling and use of music. Two shorter sections drew particular comment, involving a filmed cameo appearance of the Queen, and a live performance by the London Symphony Orchestra joined by comedian Rowan Atkinson. These were widely ascribed to Britain's sense of humour. The ceremony featured children and young people in most of its segments, reflecting the 'inspire a generation' aspiration of London's original bid for the Games.\n\nThe BBC released footage of the entire opening ceremony on 29 October 2012, edited by Danny Boyle and with background extras, along with more than seven hours of sporting highlights and the complete closing ceremony.\n\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) approached Danny Boyle to be the director of the ceremony in June 2010, and he immediately accepted. Boyle explained that there had been four things that made him take the job: he was a big Olympics fan, he lived a mile from the Stadium and so felt invested in the area, his late father's birthday was on the ceremony's date, and he felt his 'Oscar clout' would enable him to push through what he wanted to do. He said it \"felt weirdly more like a ... civic or national responsibility\" to take the job.\n\nBoyle acknowledged that the extravagance of the 2008 opening ceremony was an impossible act to follow — \"you can't get bigger than Beijing\" — and that this realisation had in fact liberated his team creatively. He said \"..obviously I'm not going to try and build on Beijing, because how could you? We can't, and you wouldn't want to, so we're going back to the beginning. We're going to try and give the impression that we're rethinking and restarting, because they've (\"opening ceremonies\") escalated since Los Angeles in 1984. They've tried to top themselves each time and you can't do that after Beijing.\" Beijing's budget had been £65m, whereas London's final budget was £27m, which was twice the original provision. The London stadium had the same number of seats as Beijing's, but was half the size; this intimacy of scale meant that Boyle felt he could achieve something personal and connecting.\n\nThe different sections of the ceremony were designed to reflect aspects of British history and culture, with the title \"Isles of Wonder\" partly inspired by Shakespeare's play \"The Tempest\" (particularly Caliban's 'Be not afeard' speech), and partly by the G. K. Chesterton aphorism: \"The world shall perish not for lack of wonders, but for lack of wonder.\"\n\nIn July 2010, Boyle started brainstorming ideas with designer Mark Tildesley, writer Frank Cottrell Boyce and costume designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb. They considered \"what was essentially British\", with the non-British Larlarb able to offer a view of what the world thought Britain meant. Cottrell Boyce had given Boyle a copy of \"Pandaemonium\", (named after the capital of Hell in \"Paradise Lost\") by Humphrey Jennings, which collated contemporary reports from the industrial revolution. It had become traditional during the opening ceremony to 'produce' the Olympic rings in a spectacular manner. Cottrell Boyce commented \"Danny had a very clear idea that in the first 15 minutes you had to have a great, startling image that could go around the world; it had to climax with something that made people go 'Oh my God!'\". Boyle decided that \"the journey from the pastoral to the industrial, ending with the forging of the Olympic rings\" would be that image.\n\nThe ten distinct chapters on which the team started work were gradually compressed into three principal movements: the violent transition from 'Green and Pleasant Land' to the 'Pandemonium' of industrial revolution, a salute to the NHS and children's literature, and a celebration of pop culture, technology and the digital revolution.\n\nWhen Boyle returned to work on the ceremony in the spring of 2011 he asked Rick Smith of Underworld, with whom he had worked on several film projects as well as his theatrical production of Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\", to be the musical director. At the same time the team moved to the Three Mills studio complex in east London, where a 4x4 metre scale model of the stadium was built. For security reasons, a single CGI-assisted version of the ceremony was kept on editor Sascha Dhillon's laptop; anyone needing it had to come to the studio.\n\nThe cast included professional performers and 7,500 volunteers. Boyle considered the volunteers to be \"the most valuable commodity of all\". In November 2011 they auditioned at Three Mills, and rehearsals began in earnest in spring 2012 at an open-air site at Dagenham (the abandoned Ford plant), often in foul weather. Although key contributors had to sign non-disclosure agreements and some elements were codenamed, Boyle placed immense trust in the volunteers by asking them simply to \"save the surprise\" and not leak any information. Further volunteers were recruited to help with security and marshalling, and to support the technical crew. Three weeks before the ceremony, Mark Rylance, who was to have taken a leading part, pulled out after a family bereavement and was replaced by Kenneth Branagh.\n\nThe Olympic Bell, the largest harmonically tuned bell in the world, weighing 23 tonnes, had been cast in brass under the direction of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry by Royal Eijsbouts of the Netherlands, and hung in the Stadium. It was inscribed with a line from Caliban's speech in \"The Tempest\": \"Be not afeard, the isle is full of noises\".\n\nBoyle gave significant emphasis to the London 2012 theme 'inspire a generation' and devised a programme relying heavily on children and young people, and built around themes that would relate to the young. 25 schools in the six original East London host boroughs were used to recruit child volunteers for the performance, and 170 sixth formers (16–18-year-olds), between them speaking more than 50 languages, were recruited from their colleges.\n\nOn 12 June 2012 at a press conference, Boyle had promised a huge set of rural Britain, which was to include a village cricket team, farm animals, a model of Glastonbury Tor, as well as a maypole and a rain-producing cloud. His intention was to represent the rural and urban landscape of Britain. The design was to include a mosh pit at each end of the set, one with people celebrating a rock festival and the other the Last Night of the Proms. Boyle promised a ceremony with which everyone would feel involved; he said, \"I hope it will reveal how peculiar and contrary we are – and how there's also, I hope, a warmth about us\". Some of the set was designed with real grass turf and soil. The use of animals (40 sheep, 12 horses, 3 cows, 2 goats, 10 chickens, 10 ducks, 9 geese and 3 sheep dogs, looked after by 34 animal handlers) drew some criticism from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Boyle, who was being advised by the RSPCA, assured PETA that the animals would be well cared for. After the press conference, much commentary in the UK Press was negative and attracted \"hundreds of comments online completely supporting...the view that the opening ceremony would be a disaster.\"\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the music used was British. The team worked next door to the office of the musical director for the closing ceremony, David Arnold, and so hearing each other's music there was a scramble to claim a particular song first. A.R. Rahman, who worked with Boyle on \"Slumdog Millionaire\" and \"127 Hours\", composed a Punjabi song 'Nimma Nimma' to showcase Indian influence in the UK, according to Boyle's wishes. More Indian music was also scheduled for inclusion in the medley. Paul McCartney was to be the ceremony's closing act.\n\nSebastian Coe was instrumental in asking the Queen to take part, responding positively when Boyle first pitched the \"Happy and Glorious\" film sequence featuring the Queen. Boyle suggested that the Queen be played either a lookalike, or by a world-class actress such as Helen Mirren, in a location to double as Buckingham Palace. Coe asked Princess Anne, a British member of the IOC and LOCOG, what she thought, and she told him to ask the Queen. Coe presented the idea to the Queen's Deputy Private Secretary. Boyle was surprised to hear that the Queen would be happy to play herself, and wanted a speaking part. Filming took place in late March 2012, and \"Happy and Glorious\" was produced by the BBC, as was the opening film sequence \"Journey along the Thames\".\n\nChanges were still being made to the programme in the final days before the ceremony: a BMX bike section was dropped due to time constraints, and the 'Pandemonium' and 'Thanks..Tim' sections were edited down. In 2016 Boyle recounted how he had come under pressure from junior minister Jeremy Hunt to cut back the NHS section, which he had saved only by threatening to resign and take the volunteers with him.\n\nTwo full dress and technical rehearsals took place in the Olympic stadium, on 23 and 25 July, in front of an audience of 60,000 comprising volunteers, cast members' families, competition winners, and others connected to the Games. Boyle asked them not to 'spoil the surprise' (#savethesurprise) for the billions who would watch on the Friday night.\n\nSeated in the Royal Box were the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall and other members of the British Royal Family. They were accompanied by Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, Prime Minister David Cameron, Spouse of the Prime Minister Samantha Cameron, former Prime Ministers John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and Mayor of London Boris Johnson. Officials of the Olympic movement included President of the IOC Jacques Rogge and LOCOG Chairman Sebastian Coe.\n\nAt exactly 20:12 (8:12 pm) the Red Arrows performed a flypast over the Olympic Stadium and then over the concert in Hyde Park. This concert featured artists selected to represent the four nations of the United Kingdom: Duran Duran, Stereophonics, Snow Patrol and Paolo Nutini.\n\nAt the beginning the stadium contained a rural scene including the model of Glastonbury Tor, a model village and a water wheel, replete with live animals (removed shortly before the ceremony began), and actors portraying working villagers, football and cricket players.\n\nFrank Turner performed three songs (\"Sailor's Boots\", \"Wessex Boy\" and \"I Still Believe\") on the model of Glastonbury Tor, joined by Emily Barker, Ben Marwood and Jim Lockey, as well as his regular backing band the Sleeping Souls. LSO On Track (an orchestra of 80 young musicians from ten East London boroughs together with 20 LSO members) then performed Edward Elgar's \"Nimrod\" from the \"Enigma Variations\", accompanied by extracts from the BBC Radio \"Shipping Forecast\", and maritime images on the big screens, while the audience held up blue sheeting to simulate the sight of the ocean. This performance celebrated Britain's maritime heritage and geographical \"isles\" status.\n\nThe ceremony began at 9pm after a one-minute '60 to 1' countdown film made up of shots of numbers, such as those on house doors, street nameplates, London buses and market labels.\n\nA two-minute film \"Journey along the Thames\", directed by Boyle and produced by the BBC, opened the ceremony. To the sound of \"Surf Solar\" by Fuck Buttons, it followed the River Thames from its source to the heart of London, juxtaposing images of contemporary British life with pastoral shots and flashes of scenes from the stadium. The characters Ratty, Mole and Toad from \"The Wind in the Willows\" were briefly seen, as was a 'Monty Python hand' pointing towards London on umbrellas, and an InterCity 125 train passing the Olympic rings as crop circles in a field. At Battersea Power Station a Pink Floyd pig was flying between the towers; the clock sound from another Pink Floyd song \"Time\" was heard passing Big Ben. The soundtrack included clips from the theme tune of \"The South Bank Show\", \"London Calling\" by The Clash, and the Sex Pistols' \"God Save the Queen\" as the film followed the route of the band's infamous cruise down the River Thames during the Silver Jubilee. After lifting to an aerial view of East London mirroring the title sequence of the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\", to the sound of the drum beats from the closing theme, the film flashed down through the Thames Barrier, into Bow Creek, and then below surface through a London Underground train and station, historic footage of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Thames Tunnel, and through the Rotherhithe Tunnel. It then switched to a sequence filmed outside the stadium shortly before the ceremony, superimposed with posters from previous Summer Olympics (all of them except 1900 Paris, 1936 Berlin, 1984 Los Angeles, and 1996 Atlanta), to a recording of \"Map Of The Problematique\" by Muse. This ended with a live shot of three cast members holding the posters for the 2012 competition.\n\nThere was then a 10-second countdown in the stadium, with children holding clusters of balloons that burst simultaneously (although one set failed to burst), with the audience shouting out the numbers.\n\nBradley Wiggins, who had won the Tour de France five days earlier, opened the ceremony by ringing the Olympic Bell that hung at one end of the stadium. Four upper-atmosphere balloons were released, each expected to carry a set of Olympic rings and a camera up to the mid-stratosphere.\n\nThe depiction of rural life already in the arena was billed as \"a reminder and a promise of a once and future better life\". Youth choirs began a cappella performances of the informal anthems of the four nations of the UK: \"Jerusalem\" (for England, sung by a live choir in the stadium and beginning with a solo from eleven-year-old Humphrey Keeper), \"Danny Boy\" (from the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland), \"Flower of Scotland\" (from Edinburgh Castle in Scotland), and \"Bread of Heaven\" (from Rhossili Beach in Wales – sung in English). These were inter-cut with footage of notable Rugby Union Home Nations' tries, England's winning drop goal from the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final, and live shots from the stadium.\n\nAs the last choir performance concluded, vintage London General Omnibus Company stagecoaches entered, carrying businessmen and early industrialists in Victorian dress and top hats, led by Kenneth Branagh as Brunel. The 50 men stepped down from the carriages and surveyed the land approvingly. After walking onto the Glastonbury Tor, Brunel delivered Caliban's \"Be not afeard\" speech, reflecting Boyle's introduction to the ceremony in the programme and signifying an aspiration of new industry or a new era in Britain. This anticipated the next section of the ceremony.\n\nThis section encapsulated British economic and social development from rural economy through the Industrial Revolution to the 1960s.\n\nProceedings were suddenly interrupted by a loud shout, recorded by volunteers during the rehearsals, followed by drumming (the pre-recorded drumming amplified by 965 cast members drumming on inverted household buckets and bins), led by Evelyn Glennie. The three-tonne oak tree on top of the Glastonbury Tor lifted, and industrial workers emerged from both the Tor's brightly lit interior and the entrances to the stadium, to swell the cast to a total of 2,500 volunteers. So began what Boyle had called the \"biggest scene change in theatre history\" and something he had been advised against attempting. Underworld's \"And I Will Kiss\" began to play, as the cast rolled away the grass and other rural props. Seven smoking chimney stacks with accompanying steeplejacks rose from the ground, along with other industrial machinery: five beam engines, six looms, a crucible and a water wheel (one of the few items left from the rural scene). Boyle said that this section celebrated the \"tremendous potential\" afforded by the advancements of the Victorian era. It also included a minute's silence in remembrance of the loss of life of both World Wars, featuring British 'Tommies' and shots of poppies, during which the names of the Accrington Pals were shown on the stadium screens. Unprompted, members of the audience stood in respect during this segment.\n\nVolunteers paraded around the stadium representing some of the groups that had changed the face of Britain: the woman's suffrage movement, the Jarrow Crusade, the first Caribbean immigrants arriving in 1948 on board the \"Empire Windrush\", a 1970s DJ float, the Nostalgia Steel Band, and The Beatles as they appeared on the cover of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". Also included were real-life Chelsea Pensioners, the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, and a group of Pearly Kings and Queens.\n\nWorkers began casting an iron ring. As the noise level and tension built, driven by the relentless rhythm of the music and the drumming, participants mimed repetitive mechanical movements associated with industrial processes such as weaving. Four glowing orange rings gradually began to be carried high above the stadium toward its centre on overhead wires, and then the ring seemingly being cast and forged in the arena began to lift. The five rings converged, still glowing and accompanied by steam and firework effects to give the impression that they were of hot metal. When the five rings formed the Olympic symbol above the stadium, they ignited and rained fire in silver and gold. The image of the Olympic rings in flame became the iconic image of the ceremony, reproduced in newspapers and web stories around the world.\n\nA short film directed by Boyle and produced by the BBC, called \"Happy and Glorious\" (after a line in the national anthem), featured the character James Bond, played by current Bond actor Daniel Craig, entering the front gate of Buckingham Palace in a London black cab. His entrance (accompanied by an arrangement of Handel's 'The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba') is noticed by Brazilian children (a nod to Rio de Janeiro, which was to be the next summer Games host city) in the throne room. Bond escorted Queen Elizabeth II (who played herself, acknowledging Bond with the words, \"Good evening, Mr Bond\") out of the building and into a waiting AgustaWestland AW139 helicopter. The film followed the helicopter across London, with shots of a cheering crowd on The Mall, Nelson's Column, the Palace of Westminster with an animated Winston Churchill statue in Parliament Square, and of the Thames past the London Eye, St Paul's Cathedral, the financial district City of London. The helicopter then passed through Tower Bridge, accompanied by the Dambusters March. The film finished with Bond and the Queen apparently jumping from a real helicopter live above the stadium, accompanied by the \"James Bond Theme\". The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, along with Rogge, were then introduced to the audience. The Queen was wearing the same dress as in the film, as if she had just arrived with James Bond.\n\nFor the scenes with the helicopter, the Queen was doubled by actress Julia McKenzie, and for the parachute jump by BASE jumper and stuntman Gary Connery wearing a dress, hat, jewellery and with a handbag. Bond was played by Mark Sutton. The helicopter had flown to the stadium from Stapleford Aerodrome in Essex, piloted by Marc Wolff.\n\nThe Union Flag was then raised by members of the British Armed Forces, while the first and third verses of the national anthem were performed \"a cappella\" by the Kaos Signing Choir for Deaf and Hearing Children.\n\nThe first part of this sequence celebrated the National Health Service (\"the institution which more than any other unites our nation\", according to the programme), which had been founded in the year of the previous London Games in 1948. Music was by Mike Oldfield. 600 dancers, all of whom were NHS staff, along with 1,200 volunteers recruited from British hospitals, entered along with children on 320 hospital beds, some of which functioned as trampolines. They started a short jive routine. Watching from the tor were specially invited hospital staff and nine child patients from Great Ormond Street Hospital. The blankets on the beds illuminated and the beds were arranged to depict a child's face with a smile and a tear (the Hospital Children's Charity's logo). The acronym 'GOSH' then changed into the initials 'NHS', turning into the shape of a crescent moon as the children were hushed to sleep and read books by the nurses.\n\nThe sequence then moved on to celebrate British children's literature. J. K. Rowling began by reading from J. M. Barrie's \"Peter Pan\" (whose copyright was given to Great Ormond Street Hospital). The Child Catcher appeared amongst the children, followed by giant puppet representations of villains from British children's literature: the Queen of Hearts, Captain Hook, Cruella de Vil and Lord Voldemort. Minutes later, 32 women playing Mary Poppins descended with their umbrellas, as the villains deflated and the actors resumed dancing. The music for this sequence included partially rearranged sections from \"Tubular Bells\" (with a giant set of tubular bells at the rear of the stage), \"Tubular Bells III\" and, after the villains had been driven away by the Mary Poppins characters, \"In Dulci Jubilo\". During this performance the children in pyjamas jumped up and down on their brightly lit beds, creating a memorable image amid the darkness of the stadium.\n\nThe sequence concluded with a pale, gigantic baby's head, with a rippling sheet for its body, in the centre of the arena. This celebrated the Scottish pioneers of obstetric ultrasound imaging.\n\nSimon Rattle was then introduced to conduct the London Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Vangelis's \"Chariots of Fire\", as a tribute to the British film industry. Rowan Atkinson appeared as a Mr. Bean-like character, comically playing a repeated note on a synthesizer He then lapsed into a filmed dream sequence in which he joined the runners from the film \"Chariots of Fire\", beating them in their iconic run along West Sands at St Andrews by riding in a car, rejoining the race and tripping the front runner. Danny Boyle later explained: \"It wasn't actually Mr. Bean. Strictly speaking, the name of his character was Derek\".\n\nThis sequence celebrated British popular music and culture, paying homage to each decade since the 1960s. To the accompaniment of the BBC newsreel theme 'Girls in Grey' and the theme tune from \"The Archers\", a young mother and son arrive in a Mini Cooper at a full-size replica of a modern British house. The 1987 \"don't worry about a hurricane\" weather forecast by Michael Fish was shown on the big screens as rain suddenly poured on the house, followed by \"Push the Button\", by Sugababes. In the centre of the arena the sides of another house, three times larger, were used as screens to show clips from various TV programmes, music videos and films, including \"A Matter of Life and Death\" (June is named for its protagonist), as well as \"Gregory's Girl\", \"Kes\", \"The Snowman\", \"The Wicker Man\", \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\", Spanish TV show \"Cuéntame cómo pasó\", and Boyle's own \"Trainspotting\". A large group of dancers, centred around Frankie and June (19-year-old Henrique Costa and 18-year-old Jasmine Breinburg) on a night out, performed to an assortment of British popular songs arranged broadly chronologically, beginning with \"Going Underground\" by The Jam, suggesting a ride on the London Underground. During this track images of the Underground were projected onto the house and former London Mayor Ken Livingstone was briefly seen. Throughout the sequence cast members were texting each other or placing social networking status updates on the Internet. Frankie and June first notice each other as a snippet from \"Wonderful Tonight\" by Eric Clapton plays, but when Frankie saw that June had dropped her phone on the Tube, he set off to return it (communicating using last number redial to her sister's phone).\n\nAn extended dance sequence followed, with songs including \"My Generation\" by The Who, \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" by the Rolling Stones, \"My Boy Lollipop\" sung by Millie Small, \"All Day and All of the Night\" by the Kinks, \"She Loves You\" by the Beatles (with footage of the band performing the song), \"Trampled Under Foot\" by Led Zeppelin, \"Starman\" by David Bowie, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen (during which the sound of the TARDIS from \"Doctor Who\" could be heard), \"Pretty Vacant\" by the Sex Pistols (during which dancers on power jumpers wearing large heads with Mohawk hairstyles performed a pogo dance, and the lyrics to the song were spelled out in LED lights around the stadium), \"Blue Monday\" by New Order, \"Relax\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood (during which Frankie, asked by June for his name, replied by revealing one of the band's \"Frankie say...\" T-shirts), \"Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)\" by Soul II Soul, \"Step On\" by Happy Mondays, \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" by Eurythmics, \"Firestarter\" by The Prodigy, and \"Born Slippy .NUXX\" by Underworld, ending with the cast singing \"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles\" as Frankie and June walked towards each other. A sequence from the film \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" was projected behind them; when they kissed, a montage of memorable kisses from film and real life was shown (including the lesbian kiss from \"Brookside\", which in some countries, including Saudi Arabia, then became the first lesbian kiss ever shown on pre-watershed television), while \"Song 2\" by Blur was played. A live performance of \"Bonkers\" by Dizzee Rascal followed, along with a further sequence in which all the cast (and \"Britain's Got Talent\" dancing duo Signature) attend a party at June's house whilst Amy Winehouse's \"Valerie\", Muse's \"Uprising\", and Tinie Tempah's \"Pass Out\" played.\n\nAt the close the larger house was raised to reveal Tim Berners-Lee working at a NeXT Computer, like the one on which he invented the World Wide Web. He tweeted 'This is for everyone', instantly spelled out in LED lights around the stadium. The programme explained \"Music connects us with each other and with the most important moments in our lives. One of the things that makes those connections possible is the World Wide Web\". Boyle wanted to honour Berners-Lee for having made the World Wide Web free and available to everyone (hence the tweet), rather than seeking a commercial profit from it.\n\nA filmed sequence showed extracts from the torch relay around the UK, to the music \"I Heard Wonders\" by David Holmes. This then cut live to show David Beckham driving a dramatically illuminated motor boat down the River Thames and under Tower Bridge, to fireworks, while footballer Jade Bailey held on to the torch in the boat. This section had been rehearsed on 24 July 2012 when the close-up shots were pre-recorded, and was directed by Stephen Daldry.\n\nThere was then a tribute to \"..friends and family of those in the stadium who cannot be here tonight\", including the victims of the '7/7' 2005 London bombings (on the day after London had been awarded the Games). Photos of people who had died were displayed on screens as a memorial, accompanied by an excerpt from Brian Eno's ambient work \"An Ending (Ascent)\".\n\nThe hymn \"Abide with Me\" was then sung by Emeli Sandé while a group of dancers choreographed by and including Akram Khan performed a contemporary dance on the theme of mortality.\n\nThe Parade of Nations of athletes (drawn from the 10,490 competing) and officials from 204 nations (and also the \"Independent Olympic Athletes\") was led, according to custom, by the Greek team, followed by other competing countries in alphabetical order, and finally the host nation Great Britain. Each of the 205 teams entered the stadium led by their flagbearer, accompanied by a child volunteer carrying a copper petal (later revealed to be part of the cauldron) and a young woman carrying a sign with the country's name in English (and wearing a dress made from fabric printed with photos of people who had applied to be Olympic volunteers).\n\nThe parade was accompanied by mainly British dance tracks and popular songs, including \"Galvanize\" by Chemical Brothers, \"West End Girls\" by Pet Shop Boys, \"Rolling in the Deep\" by Adele, \"Stayin' Alive\" by the Bee Gees and both \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" and \"Beautiful Day\" by Irish band U2, with Great Britain entering to David Bowie's song \"Heroes\". Welsh drum and bass DJ High Contrast mixed and sequenced the music for the athletes' parade.\n\nMusic with a fast rhythm of 120 bpm was used in an attempt to keep the teams walking quickly around the stadium, and this was reinforced by the drummers in the stadium; nevertheless the parade part of the programme took 1 hour 40 minutes to complete, compared to the 1 hour 29 minutes estimated in the official media guide. Once all of the athletes were inside the stadium, 7 billion small pieces of paper were dropped from a Westland helicopter, each piece representing one person on Earth.\n\nEach nation's flag was planted on the Glastonbury Tor.\n\nOnce the athletes had gathered in the centre of the stadium, the Arctic Monkeys performed \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\" and The Beatles' \"Come Together\", the latter whilst 75 cyclists circled the stadium with wings lit by LEDs representing Doves of Peace. Doves were traditionally released at Olympic opening ceremonies, although real birds have not been used since 1992. A single dove cyclist, his beak painted yellow in honour of Bradley Wiggins, appeared to fly out of the stadium.\n\nThe formal part of the ceremony was introduced by Sebastian Coe, speaking from the Tor and surrounded by flags of the participating nations. He welcomed the watching world to London. He expressed pride in being British and part of the Olympic movement, and said that the Olympics \"brings together the people of the world...to celebrate what is best about mankind\". He continued to speak of the \"truth and drama\" of sport, and then thanked Britain for \"making all this possible\". Rogge responded by thanking London, stating that it was the third time that London had held the Games, following 1908, held at short notice when Rome was unable to do so (after a volcanic eruption), and 1948 three years after the end of World War II. Rogge thanked the thousands of volunteers, to huge cheers. He announced that for the first time in Olympic history, every team had female participants. Rogge acknowledged the important role the UK had played as \"the birthplace of modern sport\", codifying its \"fair play\" ethos and building sport into the school curriculum. He appealed to athletes to play fairly and be drug-free, according to the values of Baron de Courbertin, reminding them that they were role models who would \"inspire a generation\". After expressing these sentiments again briefly in French, he invited the Queen to open the Games.\n\nThe Queen declared the competition officially open, immediately followed by a trumpet fanfare based on a theme from \"Tubular Bells\" by Mike Oldfield and then a fireworks display. The 2012 ceremony was the second time the Queen had opened an Olympic Games, the first being the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal in her capacity as Queen of Canada. It was also the first time any individual had opened a Summer Olympics twice (two more Olympiads had been opened on her behalf, with a further two Winter Games opened on her behalf).\n\nThe Olympic Flag was carried by eight people chosen from around the world to embody the Olympic values: Ban Ki-moon (as UN general secretary), Sally Becker (for courage), Doreen Lawrence (chosen for her \"tireless thirst for justice\"), Haile Gebrselassie (for his \"fight against poverty\"), Leymah Gbowee (as \"a great peacemaker\"), Shami Chakrabarti (for \"her integrity\"), Daniel Barenboim (for bringing \"harmony in place of discord\"), and Marina Silva (as UN Champion of the Earth). The flag paused in front of Muhammad Ali (invited to represent 'respect, confidence, conviction, dedication, generosity and spiritual strength'), who held it for a few moments. Ali, who had lit the flame at the 1996 Atlanta Games, was accompanied by his wife Lonnie and appeared frail. The flag was received by a colour guard of Her Majesty's Armed Forces and hoisted to the Olympic Hymn, performed by the LSO and the Grimethorpe Colliery Band. The Olympic Oaths were taken by taekwondo athlete Sarah Stevenson on behalf of the athletes, by British AIBA Referee Mik Basi on behalf of the officials, and by Eric Farrell on behalf of the coaches.\n\nThis section was named after a song by The Smiths. The motorboat driven by David Beckham arrived with the Olympic Flame via the Limehouse Cut and the Lee Navigation. Steve Redgrave lit his torch from that on the boat, and carried it into the stadium through an honour guard of 500 of the construction workers who had built the Olympic Park. He passed the flame on to a team of seven young people, each nominated by a famous British Olympian to convey the Games' aim to 'inspire a generation'. Six of the team were athletes, and the seventh was a volunteer young ambassador.\n\nThe teenagers made a lap of the stadium, each carrying the torch in turn, while Alex Trimble, lead singer of Two Door Cinema Club, performed \"Caliban's Dream\" with the Dockhead Choir, Only Men Aloud, Elizabeth Roberts, and Esme Smith. This had been written especially for the ceremony by Rick Smith of Underworld.\n\nEach young athlete was greeted by their nominating Olympian (watched by 260 British medallists from previous summer and winter Games since London 1948) and presented with their own torch, which was then lit from the flame. They jogged through a corridor between assembled athletes to the centre of the stadium, where the 204 copper petals (each inscribed with the name of the team it accompanied during the parade) were now seen in a circular formation attached to long pipes (the petals were to accompany each team home after the competition, as a souvenir). The young athletes lit some of the petals, and when the flame had spread to all of them, the pipes rose slowly from the floor of the stadium and converged to form the cauldron. The cauldron lighters were (\"nominator in brackets\"):\n\nThe cauldron designed by Thomas Heatherwick was described as \"one of the best-kept secrets of the opening ceremony\": until this point, its design, location, and who would light it had not been revealed.\n\nA flurry of spectacular fireworks accompanied by Pink Floyd's song \"Eclipse\" was supported by images of memorable Olympic victories shown on the big screens, with the stadium pixels showing Jesse Owens running. The climax of this section was a live view of the Olympic rings 34 kilometres (21 miles) above the Earth, transmitted from one of the balloons launched three and a half hours earlier. The sky was then lit by searchlights piercing the smoke (another iconic London image) from the fireworks, the Orbit tower was illuminated. Paul McCartney and his band performed the closing section of \"The End\", and then \"Hey Jude\", with its chorus sung by the audience to close the ceremony at 00:46 BST.\n\nThe eclectic programme of music was chosen to showcase almost exclusively British music with pieces representing the UK's four nations. It included classical works by British composers such as Hubert Parry, and performances by UK choirs and orchestras. The focus was mainly on music of the 1960s onwards, causing one Chinese journalist to ask: \"Will this be the most rock and roll opening ceremony ever?\".\n\nRick Smith and Underworld composed pieces for the ceremony, including \"And I Will Kiss\" used during the 'Pandemonium' section, and \"Caliban's Dream\" heard during the lighting of the cauldron. These were favourably reviewed; in \"The Guardian\", Michael Hann wrote \"Underworld ... had a bit of a triumph: the builds and fades they learned in the world of dance music lent the sometimes overwhelming visual spectacle a sense of structure\".\n\nMusical motifs were used to bind the ceremony programme together: for example, the 'whistling' theme first heard during the minute's silence embedded within \"And I Will Kiss\" returned frequently — behind the fury as the ring was being forged, emerging triumphant as the five rings came together, and again later as the main theme of 'Caliban's Dream' whilst the flame was paraded around the stadium.\n\nBells were a theme of the opening day of the Olympics, starting at 8:12am with artist Martin Creed's \"Work No. 1197: All the Bells\", when bells were rung across the UK including forty strikes of Big Ben. \"The sound of bells is the sound of England\", Boyle had told volunteers during rehearsal. Much of the music for the ceremony contained 'bell' references, linking to the large bell forged for the ceremony and evoking bells as \"the sound of freedom and peace\". Modified sequences based on the traditional British eight-bell peal underlaid \"And I Will Kiss\" and carried through into the \"Tubular Bells\"/NHS section, with handbells and a tolling large bell featured on 'Caliban's Dream' and at key points in the ceremony. A handbell chime also played after the close, as the stadium emptied.\n\nBoyle approached many of the artists personally, to see if they would be interested in performing, and he also flew to Barbados for an hour-long meeting with Mike Oldfield. A few turned him down, including Elvis Costello and David Bowie, and a well-known group Boyle has not named \"wanted £20,000 and would not budge\", and so they were not used. The performing artists were paid a nominal £1 fee to make their contracts legally binding.\n\nThe pre-recorded soundtrack \"\" was released on iTunes at midnight of 28 July 2012, with a two-disc CD set released on 2 August. Within two days the download album had topped the iTunes album charts in Britain, France, Belgium and Spain, and reached No. 5 in the United States, as well as being No. 5 in the British album charts. Rick Smith's concluding comment in the CD cover notes was: \"The isle is full of noises. The soundtrack writes itself.\"\n\nThe main loading of the stadium started on 10 May and took ten weeks of what was the wettest summer for a hundred years, posing considerable challenges. Dismantling the staging took just sixty hours.\n\nThe infield staging area was 2.5 metres high, and had to accommodate the elements revealed during the ceremony, such as the chimneys and beam engines from 'Pandemonium', and the cauldron. To ensure that it remained secret, the cauldron was code-named 'Betty', and installed and tested at night.\n\nThe stadium was rigged with a one million watt sound system and more than 500 speakers. Some of staging and 12,956 props were used, as well as of turf including crops.\n\n70,799 25 centimetre (10 inch) pixel panels were placed around the stadium, including between every seat. Each panel connected to a central computer and was fitted with nine full-colour LED pixels by Tait Technology. These enabled images to be broadcast during the performance, such as of a 1960s go-go dancer, a London Underground train, and a representation of the birth of the internet. The audience was also able to participate by waving the paddles to create a twinkling effect. These animations were designed by 59 Productions and the video animations were produced by Chinese company Crystal CG. The 2D to 3D transformation and mapping of video content onto the panels were done by Avolites Media media server consoles.\nTechnical director Piers Shepperd masterminded the complex change from rural to industrial during 'Pandemonium'. The seven inflatable chimneys were made by Airworks, and varied in height (three were , two were and two were high). They were made of soft fabric, with an outer layer of printed brick pattern. Each contained four industrial fans at the base to inflate them, and a smoke machine near the top, and were hoisted into the air from the overhead rigs. Life-size beam engines were constructed onstage by teams of stage hands and members of the Volunteer Staging Team. At the climax of 'Pandemonium', in the Olympic ring forging scene, amber lights lit in sequence created the illusion of a molten steel river, with pyrotechnic smoke and dry ice as steam. The original grass floor surface had been removed to reveal a giant stylised map of London.\n\nWorking alongside the professional crew were over 800 volunteers; some were production arts students from British drama schools. Many had been working on the Olympic and Paralympic ceremonies since early 2012 at the Three Mills Studios and Dagenham rehearsal sites, before moving to the Stadium on 16 June.\n\nThe thousands of cast were cued and co-ordinated by directions received through earphones ('in-ear monitors'), and adjustments were made during the performance: for example during Pandemonium extra volunteers were sent to make sure all the turf was cleared on time. The earphones also carried a continuous electronic metronomic four-beat to keep everyone walking and moving in time with the music.\n\nIn July 2013 it was revealed that on the morning of the ceremony, Britain's surveillance headquarters GCHQ had detected a credible cyber attack threat that could have killed the lighting system in the stadium. Counter-measures were taken, and in the afternoon contingency plans were discussed with government ministers at a meeting in the Cabinet Office briefing room. However, this attack never materialised.\n\nThe BBC's coverage started at 19:00 and continued uninterrupted until 00:50. The BBC audience averaged about 24.46 million viewers and peaked at approximately 26.9 million. This was the largest average audience for any broadcast since 1996 and one of the top 20 most-watched UK television broadcasts of all time. David Stringer of Associated Press described the coverage as \"a success...so far, the BBC's ambitious – and technically tricky – Olympic plan has worked almost without a flaw.\" Euan Ferguson of \"The Observer\" commented that \"Coverage of the Olympics so far ... has been near perfect.\" However, Clive James was critical of the build-up programme, presented by Gary Lineker and Sue Barker. Commentators for the BBC were Huw Edwards, Hazel Irvine and Trevor Nelson, the latter criticised by Andy Dawson of the \"Daily Mirror\" as floundering \"like a ventriloquist's dummy pumped full of low-grade ketamine\". Private talks were held between Boyle and BBC commentators in the run-up to the ceremony. Boyle was unhappy with a voiceover being imposed on the ceremony, which he wanted viewers to be able to enjoy without commentary. The BBC offered several options including 'no commentary' coverage for both its TV and online transmissions.\n\nNearly 41 million US viewers watched NBC's coverage of the event. Criticism was levelled at its decision to tape-delay this broadcast, and not make a live version available even to cable and web users. There were frequent interruptions by commercial breaks. Many US viewers looked for other ways to watch (such as the live BBC feed), despite both NBC and the IOC vowing to crack down on unauthorised streams. More significant criticism was levelled at NBC for cutting to a Ryan Seacrest interview with Michael Phelps during the 'memorial wall' tribute including commemoration of the victims of the 7/7 London bombings, which was seen as disrespectful and insensitive. An NBC spokesman said the network had left out that segment because its programming was \"tailored for the US audience\". There was also criticism of commentators Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira for suggesting that the Queen had actually jumped out of a helicopter. Vieira and Lauer admitted to not knowing that Tim Berners-Lee was the inventor of the World Wide Web, as she commented \"If you haven't heard of him, we haven't either\", before Lauer told the audience to Google him. These failings were picked up on Twitter during the broadcast with the hashtag #nbcfail. Commentary by Bob Costas and Lauer during the Parade of Nations was also criticised for their negative opinions about some countries' political environments and for leaving out information about the athletes, which was seen as \"smug American elitism\". It was noted that they spoke about some countries with \"outright condescension\".\n\nThe ceremony was recorded by three separate broadcasters: the BBC, the Olympic Broadcasting Services (directed by the Finnish state broadcaster YLE on behalf of the OBS), and by independent production company Done and Dusted, hired by LOCOG and working under Boyle's direction. This was the first time that an independent production company had been used for an Olympic ceremony. This situation led to some tension, as Boyle wanted more artistic control and felt he was getting no co-operation from the OBS. He criticised the OBS coverage during his commentary for the BBC DVD. In addition, the BBC filmed some of the pre-recorded parts of the ceremony. The filming was directed for television by Hamish Hamilton, who described it as \"easily the most difficult job of my life\".\n\nThe BBC released footage of the entire ceremony on 29 October 2012, edited by Danny Boyle and with background extras, filling more than one disc of a five DVD or Blu-ray disc set, which also contained more than seven hours of sporting highlights as well as the complete closing ceremony. A 'BBC commentary-free' option for the opening ceremony is available on the DVD, as well as a commentary track by Danny Boyle and Frank Cottrell Boyce. In contrast the NBC DVD only has highlights of the opening ceremony.\n\n\"The Times\" described the ceremony as \"a masterpiece\", with \"The Daily Telegraph\" saying it was \"brilliant, breathtaking, bonkers and utterly British\". The BBC's chief sports writer Tom Fordyce called it \"eccentric\" and \"tongue-in-cheek\", saying \"no-one expected ... it would be quite so gloriously daft, so cynicism-squashingly charming and, well, so much pinch-yourself fun.\" Two weeks after the ceremony Jonathan Freedland of \"The Guardian\" wrote that \"Boyle's spectacular, so beautifully executed and ingeniously conceived it lingers in the mind even as the closing draws near, stood apart from its predecessors thanks not only to its humour and eccentricity, but also because it had something to say.\" Writing in \"The Observer\", Jackie Kay commented that \"it seemed that Boyle had invented a new kind of opening ceremony, a concept ceremony, one that embraces big ideas as passionately as it does technical flamboyancy\". \"The Stage\" said that \"Danny Boyle's spectacular and moving Olympics Opening Ceremony was undoubtedly the theatrical highlight of 2012\".\n\nAlthough praise came from across the political spectrum, a few on the British political right were unhappy. \"Daily Mail\" columnist Rick Dewsbury was critical of the Grime music and portrayal of the NHS and of mixed-race families. Aidan Burley, a Conservative MP, denounced the ceremony on Twitter as \"leftie multicultural crap\". Burley's comments were dismissed by many fellow Conservatives, including David Cameron and Boris Johnson.\n\nForeign reaction was overwhelmingly positive. The \"New York Times\" said the ceremony was \"hilariously quirky ... a wild jumble of the celebratory and the fanciful; the conventional and the eccentric; and the frankly off-the-wall.\" \"Forbes\" called it Boyle's \"love song to Britain\", while \"Sports Illustrated\" noted its political aspects, calling it \"a celebration of protest and dissent\". \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" said it was \"an unforgettable start ... at once subversive and sublime\" and \"The Times of India\" said \"London presented a vibrant picture of Great Britain's rich heritage and culture.\" The Chinese news agency \"Xinhua\" described the ceremony as \"dazzling\" and an \"eccentric and exuberant celebration of British history, art and culture\". Chinese artist Ai Weiwei praised the ceremony for its \"human touch\", saying \"In London, they really turned the ceremony into a party ... such a density of information about events and stories and literature and music; about folktales and movies.\"\n\nRussian President Putin said the ceremony was \"wonderful and unforgettable\". Dmitry Medvedev said \"It was an exceptional spectacle, very well prepared and quite rich ... it succeeded in creating a very British atmosphere ... they managed to find the right language ... to communicate.\" Panos Samaras of Greece's NET said \"it was more like a big musical, a rock opera ... than an Olympics ceremony\". French sports newspaper \"L'Équipe\" wrote that it \"took the classic from such events and had fun with them\" whilst \"Le Parisien\" said it \"was magnificent, inventive and offbeat drawing heavily on the roots of British identity\". Germany's \"Die Welt\" hailed it as \"spectacular, glitzy but also provoking and moving\".\n\nChinese news CCTV-4 said the ceremony was a \"stunning feast for the eyes\". South Korea's Yonhap said it was \"by turns dramatic, imaginative, humorous and solemn\" and \"weaved the story of the country's past, present and future\". Singapore's \"Straits Times\" said it was a \"grand show\" noteworthy for both \"scale\" and \"authenticity\". The Australian Daily praised a \"glorious pandemonium devoted to London's thriving, chaotic energy ... deliberately revelling in the chaos of Britain's free society and popular culture\". France's \"Le Figaro\" said it reflected \"the best contributions that Britain has given to the world ... its sense of humour, its music, and of course sport\". The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said it was a \"rocking, rollicking, sometimes quiet and brooding ceremony.\" Qatar's \"The Peninsula\" said London did a \"spectacular job\" making the ceremony a \"memorable event\".\n\nIn an end of the year review, British magazine \"Q\" said \"It could all have been so different. As the London 2012 Summer Olympics approached, the tide of scepticism seemed almost irreversible. There was the heavy-handed sponsorship, the draconian security, the ticketing problems, the ballooning budget, and the lurking fear that the Opening Ceremony might be, in director Danny Boyle's pungent description, 'shite'. It took less than four hours on the night of Friday 27 July to turn the whole country around. Not only was the ceremony demonstrably \"not\" shite, it was the most surprising, moving, spectacular cultural event this country had ever seen...modern Britain, in all its berserk, multi-faceted glory.\"\n\nThe writer of the ceremony, Frank Cottrell Boyce, said: \"People around us thought it might need defending, so I was told to do press the next morning. I was completely surprised \"[by the positive response]\". A lot of people were surprised. But I don't think Danny was surprised. Danny never blinked. At no point did he show any feeling that it was going to be anything but amazing. And he was right.\"\n\n\nIn December 2012 the culture critic of \"The Guardian\" picked the ceremony as \"best art event of the year\". A British public survey by Samsung voted it the second most inspiring television moment of all time, second only to the 1969 moon landing. A Digital Spy survey of more than 25,000 overwhelmingly voted the ceremony as the entertainment highlight of 2012.\n\nThe ceremony was the second most-mentioned entertainment event on the internet in 2012, with just over 6 million mentions, coming second to the Grammy Awards. The BBC reported that it was the most requested item from 2012 on its iPlayer on-demand service, with 3.3 million requests.\n\nBoyle was offered a knighthood in late 2012, but turned it down, saying \"I'm very proud to be an equal citizen and I think that's what the Opening Ceremony was actually about.\"\n\nThe ceremony was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new mood in the United Kingdom: it \"had barely finished before it had become a byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's ceremony was hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this was the most important thing he took away from the Olympic experience: \"How important it is to believe in something. You might make a fool of yourself and people will go, 'How can you believe in that, you stupid idiot?' But if you believe in something, you carry people with you.\"\n\nBusiness leaders also took inspiration from the event, admiring its risk-taking and creative freedom, as well as the trust placed in and loyalty inspired from the workers and volunteers. In February 2013 the BBC's Head of Drama Ben Stephenson told an audience of writers, commissioners and producers that he \"wanted them to seek inspiration from the opening ceremony of the London Olympics\" which, he said, \"had scale and brilliance and, above all, had succeeded not in spite of its Britishness but because of its Britishness, delighting viewers here and around the world by rooting itself in the authentic stories and spirit of these islands.\" Steve Coogan told Frank Cottrell Boyce that he felt it was \"like the emperor's new clothes in reverse ... it made irony and postmodernism feel tired and past its sell-by date\", and Russell T Davies told Boyce: \"It changed my idea of the possible.\"\n\nReviewing the 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony at Sochi, Russia, Owen Gibson of \"The Guardian\" observed that with his 'complex, intimate snapshot of \"who we were, who we are and who we wish to be\"', Boyle 'rewrote the rule book for opening ceremonies'.\n\n\n\n"}

In the piece, Solway claimed that he had hunted the reclusive fisherman-poet for years until he had finally met him in 1991, and that he had begun to translate his poems in 1993.\n\nSolway claimed that Karavis had been born in 1932 in Chania, Crete, and that he lived on the Dodecanese island of Lipsi. After Karavis' education on Serifos, disrupted by World War II and the civil war, he became a fisherman and settled on Amorgos, selling his books of poetry in local harbors. Amongst his supposed collections was \"White Poems\" (1965). After having laboured in obscurity for the greater part of his life, he had become one of the country's most acclaimed and admired writers with the 1989 publication of \"The Dream Masters\".\n\nIn reality, Karavis was the creation of Solway. However, other people joined the joke. In the next issue there was a letter from a self-declared expert on Greek poetry, \"Fred Reed\". He did not dispute Karavis' existence, but claimed that Karavis was in fact a smuggler, not a fisherman, and that the first poems were nothing else that pirated translations from a group of expatriate Canadians.\n\nLater, press attaché Yiorgos Chouliaris of the Greek embassy, wrote to Solway to congratulate him for \"imaginative effort\". Solway convinced him to join the hoax.\n\nThe fame of Karavis spread. There were reports of international conferences about his poetry in Thessaloniki and Coimbra. Solway met a writer who claimed that he had admired Karavis for many years, and someone who said that Karavis was more worthy of the Nobel Prize than more famous Greek poets. He even received two postcards signed with Karavis' name.\n\nIn 2000, Chouliaris was one of the hosts at the launch of a translation of Karavis' poems, \"Saracen Island: The Poetry of Andreas Karavis\". Although Solway claimed to be the translator, the work was entirely his creation. A man who claimed to be Karavis appeared, wearing a fisherman's cap and speaking something that at least sounded like Greek.\n\nSoon afterward Matthew Hayes, a columnist of \"The Globe and Mail\" in Toronto, wrote an article entitled \"Karavis: Greek god of poetry or literary hoax?\". In a 2001 issue of \"Lingua Franca\" magazine, Solway finally confessed in public that he had invented the poet, and that the man who had appeared at the book launch, purporting to be Karavis, was actually Solway's dentist.\n\nSolway has said that he had created Karavis as an \"alter ego and heteronym\" to gain new inspiration for his poetry.\n\n\n"}

The LP is a double album itself, serving as the third installment of Chief Keef's \"Bang\" trilogy. It was leaked online on August 1, 2015. Soon after the album was released officially on iTunes on August 3, 2015, through the label FilmOn Music. The second part of the album was released on September 18, 2015, as well as the double disc being available for purchase in stores. The album features guest appearances from ASAP Rocky, Mac Miller, Lil B and Jenn Em.\n\nSince the album was originally slated for a December 2013 release, it was delayed several times, with numerous release dates falling through or never materializing. After Keef was dropped from Interscope, who owns the album name and its songs, it was unknown whether or not the album would ever be released.\n\nIn June 2015, Keef announced that the album would be released July 3, by FilmOnTV and Greek Billionaire Alki David. The album was then pushed back to July 14, with \"Ain't Missing You,\" the first post-Interscope single, released on the July 3, instead. However, the album was once again pushed back to August 18, until being released 2 weeks early on August 1. This was followed by Chief Keef announcing the second part of the album being released on August 18, only to be delayed again to September 18, while instead only releasing the single \"Bouncin\".\n\n\"Bang 3\" was originally planned to be released on December 25, 2013, as a mixtape. However, in February 2014, Chief's manager, Peeda Pan, announced the project would be developed into a full-length album. In late February it was announced Chief Keef was planning to release the EP \"Bang 4\", as a \"preview\" for \"Bang 3\". However, as \"Bang 3\", kept getting pushed back, so did \"Bang 4\", until November when Chief Keef continued to go through with his plan of releasing the EP.\n\nWhile Chief was still signed with Interscope Records, the label's executive, Larry Jackson, announced a June 10, 2014 release date. The album was later delayed to a September 30 release, and following another push back after that, Chief was dropped from Interscope Records. This is despite Jackson previously stating that he and the label were behind Keef and \"Bang 3\". An \"AllHipHop\" report details Interscope's disinterest in releasing a follow-up album to \"Finally Rich\". An anonymous source for the report details, \"Keef’s team tried to have formal meetings but nothing moved.\" Legal issues that Keef dealt with seemed to cause Interscope to \"subtly disassociate\" with Keef.\n\nRegardless, Chief Keef maintained that he would release the album himself, and after confirming his departure from the label, tweeted \"One-hundred percent of everything goes to me now.\" Additionally, Keef confirmed that he would be planning a Christmas release for the album. However, once again, the album's release did not materialize.\n\nAlthough delayed several times, Chief would release tracks from the album, to allow people to know that the album would still be eventually released. In July 2014, Chief Keef released a tentative track listing, revealing that Lil B will be featuring on the album. A$AP Rocky was also confirmed be featured on the album on the track \"Superheroes\". Fellow Chicago rapper and previous collaborator, Kanye West, was also set to feature on the track \"Nobody\", until that project developed into its own album. Keef decided to rework the entirety of \"Bang 3\"s track list, except for \"Superheroes\", which appeared on the final album. On July 25, 2015, Chief Keef organized a promotional concert for \"Bang 3\", which also served as a charity concert to help out the victims of a drive-by shooting that left Keef's fellow Glo Gang member, Capo, as well as 13-month year old Dillan Harris dead. Due to outstanding warrants, Keef performed via hologram. However, during the concert, Hammond police shut down the concert.\n\nOn August 1, 2015, 2 songs from the album featuring A$AP Rocky and Mac Miller were leaked. Soon after the album was released for free as a mixtape on the website Hot New Hip Hop and other mixtape sites. The next day, the mixtape was removed from Hot New Hip Hop at the request of Alki David, and was made available through FilmOnTV for purchase. The official version was then made available for purchase on iTunes on August 3, 2015. Later that day Keef via social media, Keef told fans Bang 3 was a double disc album. On August 8 an official release date for the second part of Bang 3 was set for August 18 which was the original release date for the album. However, come August 18 the album was delayed to September 18th with a pre-order made available. The album would then be released on September 18 with a physical edition available which included both discs and advertising 3 bonus tracks (T'd, 'Ignorant' and 'Told Ya'). Due to a technical error, the 3 bonus tracks were not featured on the physical edition and as compensation an employee of FilmOn provided those with proof of purchase 2 extra tracks ('Off The Tooka/Tooka' and 'Real Money') as well as the original advertised 3 bonus tracks.\n\nBang 3 was met with a generally positive reception, critics argued that it's his most polished work since Finally Rich. \"The higher, clearer production values are most immediately noticeable—this is the crispest-sounding Keef release since 2012's \"Finally Rich—\"and its well-ironed-out song structures.\" said Pitchfork. HipHopDX argued, \"\"Bang 3\" isn’t precisely a return to \"Finally Rich\" form as that version of Sosa may be long gone but, it is the closest he’s gotten in his continuing journey of wide-ranging sonic discovery. It isn’t Chief Keef at his best or even his most interesting; it’s Keef at his most pliable.\" Critics also praised Chief Keef's growth and experimentation with Pitchfork saying, \"it's the work of a mature rapper and songwriter, putting the skills he developed over several years spent branching out stylistically to good use\". As of January 2017 Bang 3 Sold around 63,000 copies which includes 22,000 copies of streams in the US. HipHopDX weighed in that, \"Singing To The Cheese,” eschews normal time in favor of Keef’s abstract arrangements without unraveling; moving forward while also moving sideways. It’s a reminder of everything Chief Keef has been and everything he can be.\" Tiny Mix Tapes also added, \"Getting dropped from Interscope might be the best thing that ever happened to Chief Keef, or at least the best thing for his music (his recent partnership with FilmOn remains a mysterious business move that hasn't seemed to confine him creatively whatsoever). It’s hard to imagine a major-Keef getting away with the chorus on the massive, self-produced opener “Pee Pee’d”.\n\nOn July 3, 2015, \"Ain't Missing You\", a tribute to Keef's late cousin and fellow Glo Gang member, Big Glo was released. The song featured Jenn Em and the video was released by FilmOnTV.\n\nCredits for Bang 3 adapted from liner notes in CD case\n\nPart 1\nPart 2\n"}

Dedicated to advancing the boundaries of contemporary theatre, Manson has expanded the field of contemporary performance through his use of digital media, creative interdisciplinary collaborations, and teaching. Manson is the Editor in Chief and co-curator at Contemporary Performance Network, a community organizing platform and social network dedicated to facilitating collaboration among artists, presenters, scholars and festivals. He is the co-Artistic director of the Special Effects festival, an experimental performance festival which premiered in January 2014 \n\nA Texas native, Manson attended University of Texas at Austin, where he earned awards in acting and a Presidential scholarship that supported his Bachelor of Arts in Theatre. Manson moved to New York in 1995, and in 1999, along with Jemma Nelson, he founded Big Art Group. Initially a small underground performance group, the company has since burgeoned into an internationally appreciated and critically acclaimed ensemble.\n\nManson has been responsible for the direction, co-creation, set and media design of Big Art Group's productions since its initial original work, CLEARCUT Catastrophe in 1999. Since CLEARCUT, the company has produced 22 original works with repeated tours. The People, a serial production adaptively rewritten for each city it is presented in has enjoyed success in Polverigi, Halle, San Francisco, Portland, and most recently New York.\n\nManson's work is characterized by its intense visual spectacle, savvy blending of video and live acting to produce self-reflective commentary on its own genre, and technical sophistication. At its birth, Manson envisioned Big Art Group as a means to, 'aggressively attack the boundaries of performance and art through its experimentation with structure, medium and process.\" Big Art Group's unique integration of live acting and video, known as Real Time Film, was pioneered and titled by Manson himself, and has remained a characteristic element of the artist's work, revisited and developed in new productions. Much of Big Art Group's work blends elements of popular culture and current events with scenes inspired by literature or Classical mythology. Manson's work seeks to actively engage and challenge its audience and to confront expectations constructed by traditional theatre:\n\n\"Unlike traditional theatrical performance, Big Art Group's extended mediated performances reposition viewers into active editors, challenging audience members to problem-solve complex issues of sexuality, race, narrative and truth as a theatrical mirror to the process of navigation through contemporary society.\"\n\nIn an interview with the village voice, Manson remarked on the political quality of Big Art's serial project, The People, and on his broader goal of encouraging popular engagement in art, politics, and thought: \"For me, culture is a space for critical thought,\" says Manson. \"We're not really making a show, we're making a space for people to think.\"\n\nManson has been honored with multiple funding grants from Rockefeller Foundation's Multi Arts Production Fund, fellowships from The Foundation of Contemporary Art, Pew Fellowship in the Arts, MidAtlantic Art Fellowship/ PennsylvaniaCouncil on the Arts, and MacDowell Colony.\n\n\nManson has taught and organized many various workshops in New York, Hamburg, Torino, Montreal, Polverigi, Toulouse, Istanbul, Portland and San Francisco. He has lectured at numerous colleges and universities including Reed College, Carnegie Mellon, the CUNY Graduate Center, the University of Buffalo, and Parsons. In addition to receiving invitations from leading festivals and presenters (Hebbel am Ufer Berlin, Festival d’Automne à Paris, La Vie de Festival Rome, Desingel Antwerp, Wexner Center for the Arts, REDCAT, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, Warhol Museum and the Kitchen), Manson has spoken on international panels. Manson taught at Bern University of the Arts, Brooklyn College, and Carnegie Mellon.

Though President Omar Bongo and his wife, Josephine Bongo, encouraged filmmaking in the 1970s, there was a twenty-year hiatus until filmmaking started to grow again in the new millenium.\n\nFrench companies made documentaries in colonial Gabon from 1936 onwards.\n\nAfter independence, Philippe Mory, Gabon's first professionally trained actor, organized the Compagnie Cinematographique du Gabon in 1962, and helped produce \"The Cage\", a feature film entered into the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. The national television company supported films like Pierre-Marie Dong's \"Carrefour humain\" (1969) and Mory's \"Les tams-tams se sont tus\" (1972).\n\nThough Gabon had only eight cinemas, President Omar Bongo and his wife Joséphine Bongo took a direct personal interest in film. The President built a 400-seat cinema in his presidential palace, and in 1975 founded the Centre National Du Cinéma with Mory as director. He also founded a production company, Les Films Gabonais. Gabon saw nine films from six directors in the 1970s. Les Films Gabonais produced several films co-directed by Dong and based on the writings of the presidential couple: \"Obali\" (1976) and \"Ayouma\" (1977) were based on plays examining social themes by Joséphine Bongo, and \"Demain, un jour nouveau\" (1978) was a version of the president's memoirs. Another Gabonese film from this period was Charles Mensah's \"Ilombe\" (1978).\n\nAfter two decades of relative inactivity, Gabonese filmmaking started to rise again in the new millenium. Charles Mensah at the Centre National du Cinéma Gabonais (CENACI) had introduced new policies to restructure Gabonese cinema in the early 1990s . Imunga Ivanga started making short films in the 1990s, and his feature film \"Dôlè\" (2000) was the first Gabonese feature film for two decades. It won festival awards at Carthage, Cannes and Milan. Henri-Joseph Koumba Bididi made a number of short films, and the 2001 feature film \"The Elephant's Balls\". Ivunga and Mory collaborated on \"L'Ombre de Liberty\" (2006), and in 2014 Ivunga was made general director of the national television network, Gabon Television.

Many foreign films have been produced about South Africa (usually involving race relations). \n\nOne South African film to achieve international acclaim was \"The Gods Must Be Crazy\" in 1980, set in the Kalahari. This is about how life in a traditional community of Bushmen is changed when a Coke bottle, thrown out of an aeroplane, suddenly lands from the sky. The late Jamie Uys, who wrote and directed \"The Gods Must Be Crazy\", also had success overseas in the 1970s with his films \"Funny People\" and \"Funny People II\", similar to the TV series \"Candid Camera\" in the United States. Leon Schuster's \"You Must Be Joking!\" films are in the same genre, and hugely popular among South Africans.\n\nAnother high-profile film portraying South Africa in recent years was \"District 9\". Directed by Neill Blomkamp, a native South African, and produced by Peter Jackson, the action/science-fiction film depicts a sub-class of alien refugees forced to live in the slums of Johannesburg in what many saw as a creative allegory for apartheid. The film was a critical and commercial success worldwide, and was nominated for Best Picture at the 82nd Academy Awards.\n\nOther notable films are \"Tsotsi\", which won the Academy Award for Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards in 2006 as well as \"U-Carmen eKhayelitsha\", which won the Golden Bear at the 2005 Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nThe first film studio in South Africa, Killarney Film Studios, was established in 1915 in Johannesburg.\n\nDuring the 1910s and 1920s, many South African films were made in or around Durban. These films often made use of the dramatic scenery available in rural KwaZulu-Natal, particularly the Drakensberg region. KwaZulu-Natal also served as the appropriate location for historical films such as \"De Voortrekkers\" (1916) and \"The Symbol of Sacrifice\" (1918). American filmmaker Lorimer Johnston directed several films in the area in the late 1910s which starred American actresses Edna Flugrath and Caroline Frances Cooke. Despite the participation of Johnson, Flugrath and Cooke, these were South African productions featuring local actors and stories.\n\n\"\", the first Afrikaans-language sound film, was released in 1931. Subsequent sound releases such as \"Die Wildsboudjie\" (1948), a 1949 \"Sarie Marais\" remake, and \"Daar doer in die bosveld\" (1950) continued to cater primarily to white, Afrikaans-speaking audiences.\n\nThe 1950s saw an increased use of South African locations and talent by international filmmakers. British co-productions like \"Coast of Skeletons\" (1956) and American co-productions like \"The Cape Town Affair\" (1967) reflected the a growing trend of shooting in real locations, rather than using backlots.\n\nListed alongside each distributor are the studios they represent:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "707823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=707823", "title": "Cry Freedom", "text": "Cry Freedom\n\nCry Freedom is a 1987 British-South African epic drama film directed by Richard Attenborough, set in late-1970s apartheid era South Africa. The screenplay was written by John Briley based on a pair of books by journalist Donald Woods. The film centres on the real-life events involving black activist Steve Biko and his friend Donald Woods, who initially finds him destructive, and attempts to understand his way of life. Denzel Washington stars as Biko, while actor Kevin Kline portrays Woods. \"Cry Freedom\" delves into the ideas of discrimination, political corruption, and the repercussions of violence.\n\nThe film was primarily shot on location in Zimbabwe and in Kenya due to political turmoil in South Africa at the time of production. As a film showing mostly in limited cinematic release, it was nominated for multiple awards, including Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song. It also won a number of awards including those from the Berlin International Film Festival and the British Academy Film Awards.\n\nA joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by Universal Pictures and Marble Arch Productions. It was commercially distributed by Universal Pictures cinematically, and by MCA Home Video for home media. \"Cry Freedom\" premiered in cinemas nationwide in the United States on 6 November 1987 grossing $5,899,797 in domestic ticket receipts. The film was at its widest release showing in 479 cinemas nationwide. It was generally met with positive critical reviews before its initial screening in cinemas.\n\nSouth African authorities unexpectedly allowed the film to be screened in cinemas without cuts or restrictions, despite the publication of Biko's writings being banned at the time of its release.\n\nFollowing a news story depicting the demolition of a slum in East London, South Africa, liberal journalist Donald Woods (Kevin Kline) seeks more information about the incident and ventures off to meet black activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington). Biko has been officially \"banned\" by the South African government and is not permitted to leave his defined banning area at King William's Town. Woods is formally against Biko's banning, but remains critical of his political views. Biko invites Woods to visit a black township to see the impoverished conditions and to witness the effect of the government-imposed restrictions, which make up the apartheid system. Woods begins to agree with Biko's desire for a South Africa where blacks have the same opportunities and freedoms as those enjoyed by the white population. As Woods comes to understand Biko's point of view, a friendship slowly develops between them.\n\nAfter speaking at a gathering of black South Africans outside of his banishment zone, Biko is arrested and interrogated by South African security forces. Following this, he is brought to court in order to explain his message directed toward the South African government. After he speaks eloquently in court and advocates non-violence, the security officers who interrogated him visit his church and vandalize the property. Woods assures Biko that he will meet with a government official to discuss the matter. Woods then meets with Jimmy Kruger (John Thaw), the South African Minister of Justice in his house in Pretoria in an attempt to prevent further abuse by the security force. Kruger first expresses discontent over the actions of security force, however Woods is later harassed by security forces at his home. The security men that harass Woods insinuate that their orders to visit Woods came directly from Kruger.\n\nLater, Biko decides to travel to Cape Town to speak at a student-run meeting. En route, security forces stop his car and arrest him. He is held in harsh conditions and beaten, causing a severe brain injury. A doctor recommends consulting a nearby specialist in order to best treat his injuries, but the police refuse out of fear that he might escape. The security forces instead decide to take him to a police hospital in Pretoria, around 700 miles (1 020 km) away from Cape Town. He is thrown into the back of a prison van and driven on a bumpy road, aggravating his brain injury and resulting in his death.\n\nWoods then works to expose the police's complicity in Biko's death. He attempts to expose photographs of Biko's body that contradict police reports that he died of a hunger strike, but he is prevented just before boarding a plane to leave and informed that he is now banned, therefore not able to leave the country. Woods and his family are targeted in a campaign of harassment by the security police. He later decides to seek asylum in England to expose the corrupt and racist nature of the South African authorities. After a long trek, Woods is eventually able to escape to the Kingdom of Lesotho, disguised as a priest. His wife Wendy (Penelope Wilton) and their family later join him. With the aid of Australian journalist Bruce Haigh (John Hargreaves), the British High Commission in Maseru, and the Government of Lesotho, they are flown under United Nations passports and with one Lesotho official over South African territory, via Botswana to London, where they were granted political asylum.\n\nThe film's epilogue displays a graphic detailing a long list of anti-apartheid activists (including Biko), who died under suspicious circumstances while imprisoned by the government.\n\nThe premise of \"Cry Freedom\" is based on the true story of Steve Biko, the charismatic South African Black Consciousness Movement leader who attempts to bring awareness to the injustice of Apartheid; and Donald Woods, the liberal white editor of the \"Daily Dispatch\" newspaper who struggles to do the same after Biko is murdered. In 1972, Biko was one of the founders of the Black People's Convention working on social upliftment projects around Durban. The BPC brought together almost 70 different black consciousness groups and associations, such as the South African Student's Movement (SASM), which played a significant role in the 1976 uprisings, and the Black Workers Project which supported black workers whose unions were not recognized under the Apartheid regime. Biko's political activities eventually drew the attention of the South African government which often harassed, arrested, and detained him. These situations resulted in his being banned in 1973. The banning restricted Biko from talking to more than one person at a time, in an attempt to suppress the rising anti-apartheid political movement. Following a violation of his banning, Biko was arrested and later killed while in police custody. The circumstances leading to Biko's death caused worldwide anger, as he became a martyr and symbol of black resistance. As a result, the South African government banned a number of individuals (including Donald Woods) and organizations, especially those closely associated with Biko. The United Nations Security Council responded swiftly to the killing by later imposing an arms embargo against South Africa. After a period of routine harassment against his family by the authorities, as well as fearing for his life, Woods fled the country after being placed under house arrest by the South African government. Woods later wrote a book in 1978 entitled: \"Biko\", exposing police complicity in his death. That book, along with Woods's autobiography \"Asking For Trouble\", both being published in the UK, became the basis for the film.\n\nPrincipal filming took place primarily in the Republic of Zimbabwe because of the tense political situation in South Africa at the time of shooting. Other filming locations included Kenya, as well as film studios in Shepperton and Middlesex, England. The film includes a dramatized depiction of the Soweto uprising which occurred on 16 June 1976. Indiscriminate firing by police killed and injured hundreds of African schoolchildren during a protest march.\n\nThe original motion picture soundtrack for \"Cry Freedom\" was released by MCA Records on 25 October 1990. It features songs composed by veteran musicians George Fenton, Jonas Gwangwa and Thuli Dumakude. At Biko's funeral they sing the hymn Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. Jonathan Bates edited the film's music.\n\nA live version of Peter Gabriel's 1980 song \"Biko\" was released to promote the film; although the song was not on the film soundtrack, footage was used in its video.\n\nAmong mainstream critics in the U.S., the film received mostly positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 82% of 22 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 6.5 out of 10.\nRita Kempley, writing in \"The Washington Post\", said actor Washington gave a \"zealous, Oscar-caliber performance as this African messiah, who was recognized as one of South Africa's major political voices when he was only 25.\" Also writing for \"The Washington Post\", Desson Howe thought the film \"could have reached further\" and felt the story centring on Woods's character was \"its major flaw\". He saw director Attenborough's aims as \"more academic and political than dramatic\". Overall, he expressed his disappointment by exclaiming, \"In a country busier than Chile with oppression, violence and subjugation, the story of Woods' slow awakening is certainly not the most exciting, or revealing.\" Roger Ebert in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" offered a mixed review calling it a \"sincere and valuable movie\" while also exclaiming, \"Interesting things were happening, the performances were good and it is always absorbing to see how other people live.\" But on a negative front, he noted how the film \"promises to be an honest account of the turmoil in South Africa but turns into a routine cliff-hanger about the editor's flight across the border. It's sort of a liberal yuppie version of that Disney movie where the brave East German family builds a hot-air balloon and floats to freedom.\"\n\nJanet Maslin writing in \"The New York Times\" saw the film as \"bewildering at some points and ineffectual at others\" but pointed out that \"it isn't dull. Its frankly grandiose style is transporting in its way, as is the story itself, even in this watered-down form.\" She also complimented the African scenery, noting that \"\"Cry Freedom\" can also be admired for Ronnie Taylor's picturesque cinematography\". The \"Variety Staff\", felt Washington did \"a remarkable job of transforming himself into the articulate and mesmerizing black nationalist leader, whose refusal to keep silent led to his death in police custody and a subsequent coverup.\" On Kline's performance, they noticed how his \"low-key screen presence served him well in his portrayal of the strong-willed but even-tempered journalist.\" Film critic Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film a \"thumbs up\" review calling it \"fresh\" and a \"solid adventure\" while commenting \"its images do remain in the mind ... I admire this film very much.\" He thought both Washington's and Kline's portrayals were \"effective\" and \"quite good\". Similarly, Michael Price writing in the \"Fort Worth Press\" viewed \"Cry Freedom\" as often \"harrowing and naturalistic but ultimately self-important in its indictment of police-state politics.\"\nMark Salisbury of \"TimeOut\" boasted on the film's merits by declaring the lead acting to be \"excellent\" and the crowd scenes \"astonishing\", while equally observing how the climax was \"truly nerve-wracking\". He called it \"an implacable work of authority and compassion, \"Cry Freedom\" is political cinema at its best.\" James Sanford however, writing for the \"Kalamazoo Gazette\", did not appreciate the film's enduring qualities, calling it \"a Hollywood whitewashing of a potentially explosive story.\" Rating the film with \"3 Stars\", critic Leonard Maltin wrote that the film was a \"Sweeping and compassionate film\". He did however note that the film \"loses momentum as it spends too much time on Kline and his family's escape from South Africa\". But in positive followup, he pointed out that it \"cannily injects flashbacks of Biko to steer it back on course.\"\n\nIn 2013, the movie was one of several discussed by David Sirota in \"Salon.com\" in an article concerning white savior narratives in film.\n\nThe film was nominated and won several awards in 1987–88. Among awards won were from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, the Berlin International Film Festival and the Political Film Society.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nThe film premiered in cinemas on 6 November 1987 in limited release throughout the U.S. During its opening weekend, the film opened in a distant 19th place and grossed $318,723 in business showing at 27 cinemas. The film \"Fatal Attraction\" opened in first place with $7,089,680 screening at 1,351 theaters. The film's revenue dropped by 10.6% in its second week of release, earning $284,853. For that particular weekend, the film fell to 25th place showing in 19 cinemas. The film \"The Running Man\" unseated \"Fatal Attraction\" to open in first place with $8,117,465 in box office revenue showing at 1,692 cinemas.\n\n\"Cry Freedom\" had one week in wider release beginning with the 19–21 February weekend in 1988. The film opened in 14th place showing at 479 cinemas grossing $802,235 in box office business. The film went on to top out domestically at $5,899,797 in total ticket sales through a 4-week cinematic run. For 1987 as a whole, the film would cumulatively rank at a box office performance position of 103.\n\nFollowing its cinematic release in the late 1980s, the film was released to television in a syndicated two night broadcast. Extra footage was added to the film to fill out the block of time. The film was later released in VHS video format on 5 May 1998. The Region 1 Code widescreen edition of the film was released on DVD in the United States on 23 February 1999. Special features for the DVD include; production notes, cast and filmmakers' biographies, film highlights, web links, and the theatrical cinematic. Currently, there is no scheduled release date set for a future Blu-ray Disc version of the film, although it is available in other media formats such as Video on demand.\n\n\n\n"}

On more than one occasion, Cleese has expressed his regret in not having the song follow \"Fish Licence\" in the sketch's airing on \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" (Episode 23, \"Scott of the Antarctic\" 1970) as he describes himself as \"most unmusical.\"\n\n"}

The Chinese government does not legally consider the lotteries a form of gambling. Illegal gambling in China remains common, including unofficial lotteries, clandestine casinos, and betting in games such as mahjong and various card games. In 2010, \"The Daily Telegraph (UK)\" reported that an estimated one trillion yuan are wagered in illegal gambling every year in China. Problem gambling exists in the country, and may be more prevalent than in countries with legalized gambling. Online gambling is another outlet for illegal gambling in the country.\n\nVarious attempts have been made to establish legal casinos in mainland China, although these have been unsuccessful.\n\nIn June 2018, the Chinese Government banned all online poker application. App stores had to remove all poker related applications, and the promotion of poker in general via all social media channels in China (Wechat, Weibo) became forbidden.This decision has been considered to be the Chinese equivalent of the 2011 American Black Friday.\n\nWhile some aspects of mainland Chinese law apply in Hong Kong, certain forms of gambling are legal and regulated in Hong Kong. The Law of Hong Kong is based on English common law, Hong Kong having been a British territory until 1997. Gambling in Hong Kong has been regulated since 1977. The Hong Kong Jockey Club organizes much of the legal betting in the region.\n\nGambling in Macau has been legal since the 1850s, when it was a Portuguese colony.

{"id": "14236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14236", "title": "Henrik Ibsen", "text": "Henrik Ibsen\n\nHenrik Johan Ibsen (; ; 20 March 1828 – 23 May 1906) was a Norwegian playwright, theatre director, and poet. As one of the founders of Modernism in theatre, Ibsen is often referred to as \"the father of realism\" and one of the most influential playwrights of his time. His major works include \"Brand\", \"Peer Gynt\", \"An Enemy of the People\", \"Emperor and Galilean\", \"A Doll's House\", \"Hedda Gabler\", \"Ghosts\", \"The Wild Duck\", \"When We Dead Awaken\", \"Pillars of Society\", \"The Lady from the Sea\", \"Rosmersholm\", \"The Master Builder\", and \"John Gabriel Borkman\". He is the most frequently performed dramatist in the world after Shakespeare, and by the early 20th century \"A Doll's House\" became the world's most performed play.\n\nSeveral of his later dramas were considered scandalous to many of his era, when European theatre was expected to model strict morals of family life and propriety. Ibsen's later work examined the realities that lay behind the façades, revealing much that was disquieting to a number of his contemporaries. He had a critical eye and conducted a free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality. His early poetic and cinematic play \"Peer Gynt\", however, has also strong surreal elements.\n\nIbsen is often ranked as one of the most distinguished playwrights in the European tradition. Richard Hornby describes him as \"a profound poetic dramatist—the best since Shakespeare\". He is widely regarded as the most important playwright since Shakespeare. He influenced other playwrights and novelists such as George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Arthur Miller, James Joyce, Eugene O'Neill, and Miroslav Krleža. Ibsen was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1902, 1903, and 1904.\n\nIbsen wrote his plays in Danish (the common written language of Denmark and Norway during his lifetime) and they were published by the Danish publisher Gyldendal. Although most of his plays are set in Norway—often in places reminiscent of Skien, the port town where he grew up—Ibsen lived for 27 years in Italy and Germany, and rarely visited Norway during his most productive years. Born into a merchant family connected to the patriciate of Skien, Ibsen shaped his dramas according to his family background. He was the father of Prime Minister Sigurd Ibsen. Ibsen's dramas have a strong influence upon contemporary culture.\n\nIbsen was born to Knud Ibsen (1797–1877) and Marichen Altenburg (1799–1869), into a well-to-do merchant family, in the small port town of Skien in Telemark county, a city which was noted for shipping timber. As he wrote in an 1882 letter to critic and scholar Georg Brandes, \"my parents were members on both sides of the most respected families in Skien\", explaining that he was closely related with \"just about all the patrician families who then dominated the place and its surroundings\", mentioning the families Paus, Plesner, von der Lippe, Cappelen and Blom. Ibsen's grandfather, ship captain Henrich Ibsen (1765–1797), had died at sea in 1797, and Knud Ibsen was raised on the estate of ship-owner Ole Paus (1766–1855), after his mother Johanne, Plesner (1770–1847), remarried. Knud Ibsen's half-brothers included lawyer and politician Christian Cornelius Paus, banker and ship-owner Christopher Blom Paus, and lawyer Henrik Johan Paus, who grew up with Ibsen's mother in the Altenburg home and after whom Henrik (Johan) Ibsen was named.\nKnud Ibsen's paternal ancestors were ship captains of Danish origin, but he decided to become a merchant, and had some initial success. His marriage to Marichen Altenburg, a daughter of ship-owner Johan Andreas Altenburg (1763–1824) and Hedevig Christine Paus (1763–1848), was a successful match. Theodore Jorgenson points out that \"Henrik's ancestry [thus] reached back into the important Telemark family of Paus both on the father's and on the mother's side. Hedvig Paus must have been well known to the young dramatist, for she lived until 1848.\" Henrik Ibsen was fascinated by his parents' \"strange, almost incestuous marriage,\" and would treat the subject of incestuous relationships in several plays, notably his masterpiece \"Rosmersholm\".\n\nWhen Henrik Ibsen was around seven years old, however, his father's fortunes took a significant turn for the worse, and the family was eventually forced to sell the major Altenburg building in central Skien and move permanently to their small summer house, \"Venstøp\", outside of the city. Henrik's sister Hedvig would write about their mother: \"She was a quiet, lovable woman, the soul of the house, everything to her husband and children. She sacrificed herself time and time again. There was no bitterness or reproach in her.\" The Ibsen family eventually moved to a city house, Snipetorp, owned by Knud Ibsen's half-brother, wealthy banker and ship-owner Christopher Blom Paus.\n\nHis father's financial ruin would have a strong influence on Ibsen's later work; the characters in his plays often mirror his parents, and his themes often deal with issues of financial difficulty as well as moral conflicts stemming from dark secrets hidden from society. Ibsen would both model and name characters in his plays after his own family. A central theme in Ibsen's plays is the portrayal of suffering women, echoing his mother Marichen Altenburg; Ibsen's sympathy with women would eventually find significant expression with their portrayal in dramas such as \"A Doll's House\" and \"Rosmersholm\".\n\nAt fifteen, Ibsen was forced to leave school. He moved to the small town of Grimstad to become an apprentice pharmacist and began writing plays. In 1846, when Ibsen was 18, he had a liaison with Else Sophie Jensdatter Birkedalen which produced a son, Hans Jacob Hendrichsen Birkdalen, whose upbringing Ibsen paid for until the boy was fourteen, though Ibsen never saw Hans Jacob. Ibsen went to Christiania (later renamed Kristiania and then Oslo) intending to matriculate at the university. He soon rejected the idea (his earlier attempts at entering university were blocked as he did not pass all his entrance exams), preferring to commit himself to writing. His first play, the tragedy \"Catilina\" (1850), was published under the pseudonym \"Brynjolf Bjarme\", when he was only 22, but it was not performed. His first play to be staged, \"The Burial Mound\" (1850), received little attention. Still, Ibsen was determined to be a playwright, although the numerous plays he wrote in the following years remained unsuccessful. Ibsen's main inspiration in the early period, right up to \"Peer Gynt\", was apparently the Norwegian author Henrik Wergeland and the Norwegian folk tales as collected by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe. In Ibsen's youth, Wergeland was the most acclaimed, and by far the most read, Norwegian poet and playwright.\n\nHe spent the next several years employed at Det norske Theater (Bergen), where he was involved in the production of more than 145 plays as a writer, director, and producer. During this period, he published five new, though largely unremarkable, plays. Despite Ibsen's failure to achieve success as a playwright, he gained a great deal of practical experience at the Norwegian Theater, experience that was to prove valuable when he continued writing.\n\nIbsen returned to Christiania in 1858 to become the creative director of the Christiania Theatre. He married Suzannah Thoresen on 18 June 1858 and she gave birth to their only child Sigurd on 23 December 1859. The couple lived in very poor financial circumstances and Ibsen became very disenchanted with life in Norway. In 1864, he left Christiania and went to Sorrento in Italy in self-imposed exile. He didn't return to his native land for the next 27 years, and when he returned to it he was a noted, but controversial, playwright.\n\nHis next play, \"Brand\" (1865), brought him the critical acclaim he sought, along with a measure of financial success, as did the following play, \"Peer Gynt\" (1867), to which Edvard Grieg famously composed incidental music and songs. Although Ibsen read excerpts of the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard and traces of the latter's influence are evident in \"Brand\", it was not until after \"Brand\" that Ibsen came to take Kierkegaard seriously. Initially annoyed with his friend Georg Brandes for comparing Brand to Kierkegaard, Ibsen nevertheless read \"Either/Or\" and \"Fear and Trembling\". Ibsen's next play \"Peer Gynt\" was consciously informed by Kierkegaard.\n\nWith success, Ibsen became more confident and began to introduce more and more of his own beliefs and judgements into the drama, exploring what he termed the \"drama of ideas\". His next series of plays are often considered his Golden Age, when he entered the height of his power and influence, becoming the center of dramatic controversy across Europe.\n\nIbsen moved from Italy to Dresden, Germany, in 1868, where he spent years writing the play he regarded as his main work, \"Emperor and Galilean\" (1873), dramatizing the life and times of the Roman emperor Julian the Apostate. Although Ibsen himself always looked back on this play as the cornerstone of his entire works, very few shared his opinion, and his next works would be much more acclaimed. Ibsen moved to Munich in 1875 and began work on his first contemporary realist drama \"The Pillars of Society\", first published and performed in 1877. \"A Doll's House\" followed in 1879. This play is a scathing criticism of the marital roles accepted by men and women which characterized Ibsen's society.\n\n\"Ghosts\" followed in 1881, another scathing commentary on the morality of Ibsen's society, in which a widow reveals to her pastor that she had hidden the evils of her marriage for its duration. The pastor had advised her to marry her fiancé despite his philandering, and she did so in the belief that her love would reform him. But his philandering continued right up until his death, and his vices are passed on to their son in the form of syphilis. The mention of venereal disease alone was scandalous, but to show how it could poison a respectable family was considered intolerable.\n\nIn \"An Enemy of the People\" (1882), Ibsen went even further. In earlier plays, controversial elements were important and even pivotal components of the action, but they were on the small scale of individual households. In \"An Enemy\", controversy became the primary focus, and the antagonist was the entire community. One primary message of the play is that the individual, who stands alone, is more often \"right\" than the mass of people, who are portrayed as ignorant and sheeplike. Contemporary society's belief was that the community was a noble institution that could be trusted, a notion Ibsen challenged. In \"An Enemy of the People\", Ibsen chastised not only the conservatism of society, but also the liberalism of the time. He illustrated how people on both sides of the social spectrum could be equally self-serving. \"An Enemy of the People\" was written as a response to the people who had rejected his previous work, \"Ghosts\". The plot of the play is a veiled look at the way people reacted to the plot of \"Ghosts\". The protagonist is a physician in a vacation spot whose primary draw is a public bath. The doctor discovers that the water is contaminated by the local tannery. He expects to be acclaimed for saving the town from the nightmare of infecting visitors with disease, but instead he is declared an 'enemy of the people' by the locals, who band against him and even throw stones through his windows. The play ends with his complete ostracism. It is obvious to the reader that disaster is in store for the town as well as for the doctor.\n\nAs audiences by now expected, Ibsen's next play again attacked entrenched beliefs and assumptions; but this time, his attack was not against society's mores, but against overeager reformers and their idealism. Always an iconoclast, Ibsen was equally willing to tear down the ideologies of any part of the political spectrum, including his own.\n\n\"The Wild Duck\" (1884) is by many considered Ibsen's finest work, and it is certainly the most complex. It tells the story of Gregers Werle, a young man who returns to his hometown after an extended exile and is reunited with his boyhood friend Hjalmar Ekdal. Over the course of the play, the many secrets that lie behind the Ekdals' apparently happy home are revealed to Gregers, who insists on pursuing the absolute truth, or the \"Summons of the Ideal\". Among these truths: Gregers' father impregnated his servant Gina, then married her off to Hjalmar to legitimize the child. Another man has been disgraced and imprisoned for a crime the elder Werle committed. Furthermore, while Hjalmar spends his days working on a wholly imaginary \"invention\", his wife is earning the household income.\n\nIbsen displays masterful use of irony: despite his dogmatic insistence on truth, Gregers never says what he thinks but only insinuates, and is never understood until the play reaches its climax. Gregers hammers away at Hjalmar through innuendo and coded phrases until he realizes the truth; Gina's daughter, Hedvig, is not his child. Blinded by Gregers' insistence on absolute truth, he disavows the child. Seeing the damage he has wrought, Gregers determines to repair things, and suggests to Hedvig that she sacrifice the wild duck, her wounded pet, to prove her love for Hjalmar. Hedvig, alone among the characters, recognizes that Gregers always speaks in code, and looking for the deeper meaning in the first important statement Gregers makes which does not contain one, kills herself rather than the duck in order to prove her love for him in the ultimate act of self-sacrifice. Only too late do Hjalmar and Gregers realize that the absolute truth of the \"ideal\" is sometimes too much for the human heart to bear.\n\nLate in his career, Ibsen turned to a more introspective drama that had much less to do with denunciations of society's moral values and more to do with the problems of individuals. In such later plays as \"Hedda Gabler\" (1890) and \"The Master Builder\" (1892), Ibsen explored psychological conflicts that transcended a simple rejection of current conventions. Many modern readers, who might regard anti-Victorian didacticism as dated, simplistic or hackneyed, have found these later works to be of absorbing interest for their hard-edged, objective consideration of interpersonal confrontation. \"Hedda Gabler\" is probably Ibsen's most performed play, with the title role regarded as one of the most challenging and rewarding for an actress even in the present day. \"Hedda Gabler\" and \"A Doll's House\" center on female protagonists whose almost demonic energy proves both attractive and destructive for those around them, and while Hedda has a few similarities with the character of Nora in \"A Doll's House\", many of today's audiences and theatre critics feel that Hedda's intensity and drive are much more complex and much less comfortably explained than what they view as rather routine feminism on the part of Nora.\n\nIbsen had completely rewritten the rules of drama with a realism which was to be adopted by Chekhov and others and which we see in the theatre to this day. From Ibsen forward, challenging assumptions and directly speaking about issues has been considered one of the factors that makes a play art rather than entertainment. His works were brought to an English-speaking audience, largely thanks to the efforts of William Archer and Edmund Gosse. These in turn had a profound influence on the young James Joyce who venerates him in his early autobiographical novel \"Stephen Hero\". Ibsen returned to Norway in 1891, but it was in many ways not the Norway he had left. Indeed, he had played a major role in the changes that had happened across society. Modernism was on the rise, not only in the theatre, but across public life.\n\nIbsen intentionally obscured his influences. However, asked later what he had read when he wrote Catiline, Ibsen replied that he had read only the Danish Norse saga-inspired Romantic tragedian Adam Oehlenschläger and Ludvig Holberg, \"the Scandinavian Molière\". [BBC Radio 4's in Our Time from Thursday, 31 May 2018 www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b42q58]\n\nOn 23 May 1906, Ibsen died in his home at Arbins gade 1 in Kristiania (now Oslo) after a series of strokes in March 1900. When, on 22 May, his nurse assured a visitor that he was a little better, Ibsen spluttered his last words \"On the contrary\" (\"Tvertimod!\"). He died the following day at 2:30 pm.\n\nIbsen was buried in Vår Frelsers gravlund (\"The Graveyard of Our Savior\") in central Oslo.\n\nThe 100th anniversary of Ibsen's death in 2006 was commemorated with an \"Ibsen year\" in Norway and other countries. This year the homebuilding company Selvaag also opened \"Peer Gynt\" Sculpture Park in Oslo, Norway, in Henrik Ibsen's honour, making it possible to follow the dramatic play \"Peer Gynt\" scene by scene. Will Eno's adaptation of Ibsen's \"Peer Gynt\", titled \"Gnit\", had its world premiere at the 37th Humana Festival of New American Plays in March 2013.\n\nOn 23 May 2006, The Ibsen Museum in Oslo reopened to the public the house where Ibsen had spent his last eleven years, completely restored with the original interior, colors, and decor.\n\nOn the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Ibsen's death in 2006, the Norwegian government organised the Ibsen Year, which included celebrations around the world. The NRK produced a miniseries on Ibsen's childhood and youth in 2006, \"An Immortal Man\". Several prizes are awarded in the name of Henrik Ibsen, among them the International Ibsen Award, the Norwegian Ibsen Award and the Ibsen Centennial Commemoration Award.\n\nEvery year, since 2008, the annual \"Delhi Ibsen Festival\", is held in Delhi, India, organized by the Dramatic Art and Design Academy (DADA) in collaboration with The Royal Norwegian Embassy in India. It features plays by Ibsen, performed by artists from various parts of the world in varied languages and styles.\n\nThe Ibsen Society of America (ISA) was founded in 1978 at the close of the Ibsen Sesquicentennial Symposium held in New York City to mark the 150th anniversary of Henrik Ibsen's birth. Distinguished Ibsen translator and critic Rolf Fjelde, Professor of Literature at Pratt Institute and the chief organizer of the Symposium, was elected Founding President. In December 1979, the ISA was certified as a non-profit corporation under the laws of the State of New York. Its purpose is to foster through lectures, readings, performances, conferences, and publications an understanding of Ibsen's works as they are interpreted as texts and produced on stage and in film and other media. An annual newsletter \"Ibsen News and Comment\" is distributed to all members.\n\nIbsen's ancestry has been a much studied subject, due to his perceived foreignness and due to the influence of his biography and family on his plays. Ibsen often made references to his family in his plays, sometimes by name, or by modelling characters after them.\n\nThe oldest documented member of the Ibsen family was ship's captain Rasmus Ibsen (1632–1703) from Stege, Denmark. His son, ship's captain Peder Ibsen became a burgher of Bergen in Norway in 1726. Henrik Ibsen had Danish, German, Norwegian and some distant Scottish ancestry. Most of his ancestors belonged to the merchant class of original Danish and German extraction, and many of his ancestors were ship's captains.\n\nIbsen's biographer Henrik Jæger famously wrote in 1888 that Ibsen did not have a drop of Norwegian blood in his veins, stating that \"the ancestral Ibsen was a Dane\". This, however, is not completely accurate; notably through his grandmother Hedevig Paus, Ibsen was descended from one of the very few families of the patrician class of original Norwegian extraction, known since the 15th century. Ibsen's ancestors had mostly lived in Norway for several generations, even though many had foreign ancestry.\n\nThe name Ibsen is originally a patronymic, meaning \"son of Ib\" (Ib is a Danish variant of Jacob). The patronymic became \"frozen\", i.e. it became a permanent family name, in the 17th century. The phenomenon of patronymics becoming frozen started in the 17th century in bourgeois families in Denmark, and the practice was only widely adopted in Norway from around 1900.\n\nFrom his marriage with Suzannah Thoresen, Ibsen had one son, lawyer and government minister Sigurd Ibsen. Sigurd Ibsen married Bergljot Bjørnson, the daughter of Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. Their son was Tancred Ibsen, who became a film director and was married to Lillebil Ibsen; their only child was diplomat Tancred Ibsen, Jr. Sigurd Ibsen's daughter, Irene Ibsen, married Josias Bille, a member of the Danish ancient noble Bille family; their son was Danish actor Joen Bille.\n\nIbsen was decorated Knight in 1873, Commander in 1892, and with the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav in 1893. He received the Grand Cross of the Danish Order of the Dannebrog, and the Grand Cross of the Swedish Order of the Polar Star, and was Knight, First Class of the Order of Vasa.\n\nWell known stage directors in Austria and Germany as Theodor Lobe (1833–1905), Paul Barnay (1884–1960), Max Burckhard (1854–1912), Otto Brahm (1956–1912), Carl Heine (1861–1927), Paul Albert Glaeser-Wilken (1874–1942), Victor Barnowsky (1875–1952), Eugen Robert (1877–1944), Leopold Jessner (1878–1945), Ludwig Barnay (1884–1960), Alfred Rotter (1886–1933), Fritz Rotter (1888–1939), (1900–1973) and Peter Zadek (1926–2009) performed the work of Ibsen.\n\nIn 1995, the asteroid 5696 Ibsen was named in his memory.\n\nThe authoritative translation in the English language for Ibsen remains the 1928 ten-volume version of the \"Complete Works of Henrik Ibsen\" from Oxford University Press. Many other translations of individual plays by Ibsen have appeared since 1928 though none have purported to be a new version of the complete works of Ibsen.\n\n\nThere have been numerous adaptations of Ibsen's work, particularly in film, theatre and music. Notable are Torstein Blixfjord's \"Terje\" and \"Identity of the Soul\" – two multimedia, film and dance pieces first presented in Yokohama in 2006, based on the poem \"Terje Vigen\".\n\n\n\n"}

Yao's unit was charged of defending the same depot which develops a new weapon made of chili. They also sent spies upon a Japanese armory depot in Xiyingwu, disguised as supplying Collaborrators. Peng also inspects several volunteers preparing clothes and explains to Zuo the importance of the offensive when 120th Division gives them telegrams. Yao's unit was charged of attacking the depot in Xiyingwu and the division was led by Zuo himself, but there are Japanese armor that serves as reinforcements and civilians as comfort women inside the depot. Another unit ambushed the armor convoy while Zuo's unit assaulted the depot. When the women were rescued, at the cost of Liu Zhu Zi, whose family hated him for being a 'traitor' and demoted from being a commander to an infantryman, they relentlessly killed all the Japanese soldiers they find. Mao took the telegram on its success.

They were charged to plant explosives under the main base. The mute man sacrificed himself while delaying the cavalry charge, Peng took the bloodied shoes. Yao was hit by airstrike, but unharmed while Liang's men are busy planting explosives. She saved Yao from an exploding bomb, knocked her unconscious. A soldier sacrificed his life while repairing the detonation cord and detonated, destroying the flanks, while Yao carries Liang to safety.\n\nThe battle ends in Peng's victory, taking the mountains. months later, Peng and Zuo debriefs his men when Yao approaches Peng and told him that if not for Liang (she died of wounds), and Peng's words, he will not be encouraged. Peng told him that it's not him, but Yao's sacrifice made him. Mao made a speech praising Hundred Regiment Offensives and commanded the listeners to use this as inspiration.

Part of the \"Jumanji\" franchise, the film is a sequel to the 1995 \"Jumanji\", which was based on the 1981 children's book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg. It pays tribute to Robin Williams, the star of the first film, by mentioning his character's name. In addition, a replica of the used by Williams's character also appears as a clue for the Jumanji game's new players. The film stars Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, Nick Jonas, and Bobby Cannavale. Set twenty-one years after \"Jumanji\", it follows four teenagers who are transported into the video game world of Jumanji and play as their chosen characters. Joining another player, they must overcome the game's magical power to win and return home.\n\nPrincipal photography began in Honolulu in September 2016 and ended in Atlanta in December. \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\" premiered at the Grand Rex in Paris on December 5, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 20 in RealD 3D and IMAX, by Sony Pictures Releasing under its Columbia Pictures label; unlike its predecessor, which was distributed by Tristar Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who called it a \"pleasant surprise\" and praised the cast. It grossed over $962million worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2017 and the 42nd-highest-grossing film of all time.\n\nA sequel is scheduled to be released on December 13, 2019.\n\nIn 1996 in Brantford, New Hampshire, teenager Alex Vreeke is given the Jumanji board game by his father, who found it on a beach. Uninterested, he sets the game aside. That night, it transforms into a video game cartridge which catches Alex's attention when he is awakened by the Jumanji drum beats. When he begins playing it, he disappears into the game.\n\nTwenty years later, four students at Brantford High School are sentenced to detention: Spencer Gilpin and his former friend Anthony \"Fridge\" Johnson for cheating, Bethany Walker for making a phone call during an English test, and Martha Kaply for refusing to participate in gym class and insulting her teacher. In the school basement, where they are serving their detention, Fridge discovers Alex's discarded video-game system, and he and Spencer decide to play. Although it has five playable characters, they are unable to select the first one, so they choose two others, and convince the girls to play as the remaining two. When Spencer presses \"Start\", they are transported into the game.\n\nThey land in a jungle, in the forms of their game avatars. Spencer is a tough, muscular explorer and archaeologist named Dr. Smolder Bravestone; Fridge is a diminutive zoologist named Franklin \"Mouse\" Finbar; Bethany is an overweight male cartographer named Professor Shelly Oberon; and Martha is a female commando and martial arts expert named Ruby Roundhouse. They each have three lives marked on their arms and Bethany immediately loses one after being eaten by a hippo. Spencer deduces that if they lose all three, they die for real.\n\nThey learn the game's story from NPC Nigel: corrupt archeologist Russel Van Pelt stole the Jaguar's Eye, a magic jewel, from its shrine, cursing Jumanji. Nigel escaped Van Pelt with the jewel, and the players must return it to a jaguar statue and call \"Jumanji\" to lift the curse. Nigel warns them that Van Pelt will stop at nothing to retrieve the jewel, which gives him control of Jumanji's animals. They begin tackling the game's increasingly-difficult \"levels\", losing lives as they do so. The four are rescued by Alex, the missing fifth player, whose avatar is pilot Jefferson \"Seaplane\" McDonough. Taking shelter in a jungle house built by the game's previous player Alan Parrish, Alex believes that he has been in the game for a few months and is distressed to learn that it is really twenty years. The newcomers vow to help him return home. They break into a transportation shed, commandeering a helicopter to fly to the jaguar statue and return the jewel, but Fridge drops the jewel into a herd of white rhinoceros. Spencer sacrifices one of Fridge's lives, pushing him out of the helicopter as a distraction, and retrieves the jewel. Alex loses his last life when a mosquito bites him, but Bethany performs CPR and transfers one of her lives to him.\n\nAt the statue, the players are surrounded by a pack of jaguars and Van Pelt's forces. They outmaneuver their opposition while Spencer and Martha race to the statue. Van Pelt confronts Martha and demands the jewel, but she purposely gets a snake to bite her, allowing her to respawn and to get the jewel to Spencer. With the players on their last lives, they end the game, with Van Pelt disintegrating into a bunch of rats, and return to the school basement, though without Alex. They find the formerly-dilapidated Vreeke home restored and decorated for a Christmas family gathering. An adult Alex arrives, having returned to 1996 when the game ended. Now married with children, he reveals he named his eldest daughter after Bethany out of gratitude for saving his life.\n\nSpencer and Fridge reconcile, Bethany begins caring for others more than herself and plans a summer wilderness backpacking adventure, Martha and Spencer become romantically involved and the four are now friends after their experiences in the game. When they hear Jumanji's drumbeats, they bring the game behind the school and Fridge destroys it to prevent anyone from playing it again.\n\n\nIn July 2012, rumors circulated that a remake of \"Jumanji\" was in development. In an interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Columbia Pictures president Doug Belgrad said: \"We're going to try and reimagine \"Jumanji\" and update it for the present.\" On August 1, 2012, it was confirmed that Matthew Tolmach would produce the new version with William Teitler (who produced the original film).\n\nIn August 2015, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced that the film was scheduled for release on December 25, 2016. Online reception to the news was negative, with some saying that the announcement came too soon after the August 2014 death of Robin Williams (who played Alan Parrish in the original film). The announcement was criticized by Bradley Pierce (who played Peter Shepherd in \"Jumanji\") and by \"E! News\", which called the remake \"unnecessary and kind of insulting\". On October 23, 2015, Scott Rosenberg was hired to rewrite the script for the film, whose production was a high priority for the studio. On January 14, 2016, \"Deadline Hollywood\" reported that Jake Kasdan had been hired to direct the film from a script by Rosenberg and Jeff Pinkner based on a draft by original writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers.\n\nIn March 2017, during CinemaCon, it was announced that the film's complete title was \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\". Its plot involved teenagers cleaning out a school's basement who find a vintage video-game version of \"Jumanji\" and are sucked into the first film's jungle setting. Although fans debated whether the film was a sequel or a reboot, the second trailer (released on September 20, 2017) indicated that the sequel is set 21 years after the first. Dwayne Johnson noted that the film was inspired by classic video games of the 1990s.\n\nOn April 15, \"Variety\" reported that Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart were in early talks to star in the film (although both actors had other projects). Later in the month, Johnson confirmed his casting on Instagram. In July, it was reported that Nick Jonas had joined the film's cast with Johnson, Hart, and Jack Black. The following month, Johnson said that the film would not be a reboot but a continuation of the 1995 film; Karen Gillan was announced as part of the cast. On September 20, Ser'Darius Blain was cast as Anthony \"Fridge\" Johnson and Madison Iseman as Bethany Walker. Two days later, Rhys Darby was cast as Nigel Billingsley, Morgan Turner as Martha Kaply, and Alex Wolff as Spencer Gilpin. In November 2016, Bobby Cannavale announced his casting in the film, and in December 2016, Tim Matheson joined the cast as Old Man Vreeke.\n\nPrincipal photography began on September 19, 2016, in Honolulu, Hawaii, primarily at the Kualoa Ranch nature reserve. The film wrapped on December 8 in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nJames Newton Howard was originally signed to compose the film's score, he was replaced by Henry Jackman when the film's release date was postponed six months. The soundtrack was released digitally on 15 December 2017 by Sony Masterworks.\n\nIn August 2015, Sony gave the film a release date of December 25, 2016. Since filming did not begin until September 2016, the release was pushed back to July 28 and then to December 20, 2017.\n\nOn November 29, 2017, it was announced that Amazon Prime members in the United States would have early access to tickets for a December 8 screening of the film at select Regal, National Amusements, ArcLight Cinemas and AMC theaters. The screenings sold out at 1,200 theaters and earned $1.9 million. The film was released on IMAX 2D on January 12, 2018.\n\n\"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\" grossed $404.5 million in the United States and Canada and $557.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $962.1 million. On April 10, 2018, the film passed \"Spider-Man\" ($403.7 million) to become Sony's highest-grossing film domestically. \"Deadline Hollywood\" calculated its net profit as $305.7 million when factoring all expenses and revenues, making it 2017's fourth-most-profitable release.\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada, the film was released on December 20, 2017 with \"The Greatest Showman\" and was projected to gross about $60 million from 3,765 theaters in its six-day opening weekend; the studio predicted a $45 million debut. It earned $7.2 million on its first day and $7.6 million on its second day. Over the three-day weekend, the film grossed $36.2 million (for a six-day total of $71.9 million), finishing second at the box office behind \"\". Its weekend-only earnings increased to $50.1 million during its second weekend, again finishing in second place at the box office. The 38.4 percent weekend-to-weekend increase was the fourth-largest for a film playing in over 3,000 theaters; \"The Greatest Showman\" set the record for best hold the same weekend. The film passed \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" for the top spot the following weekend, declining 28.1 percent to $36 million, and finished first again the following week with $28.1 million (and a total of $35.2 million over the four-day MLK weekend). \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\" remained atop the box office for its third weekend, earning $19.5 million.\n\nIt again topped the box office for a fourth consecutive week (its sixth week overall in theatres) with $20 million, easily surpassing new releases \"12 Strong\" and \"Den of Thieves\" (both films finished their entire run with box office lower than \"Jumanji: Welcome...\" grossed in its first 10 days). The film continued to do well the following week, dropping 16 percent (to $16.4 million) and finishing second to \"\", before regaining the top spot for a fifth time the following weekend with $11.1 million.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 77% based on 209 reviews and an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\" uses a charming cast and a humorous twist to offer an undemanding yet solidly entertaining update on its source material.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 58 out of 100 based on 44 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nDave White of \"TheWrap\" praised the cast and called the film a pleasant surprise: \"\"Jumanji: Welcome to The Jungle\" is the Christmas tentpole release that aims to please and succeeds, a funny family entertainment product that subverts more expectations than it was obligated to contractually\". David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a C grade, calling it unnecessary but mildly amusing: \"\"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\" is further proof that even the stalest whiff of brand recognition has become preferable to originality. Only part of the blame for that belongs to the studios but after cannibalizing themselves for much of the last 20 years, Hollywood has clearly eaten their way down to the crumbs\". For \"Variety\", Owen Gleiberman wrote: \"Excitement! Suspense! Childlike innocence! Ingeniously staged action set pieces! These are a few of the things you will not find, anywhere, in \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\" ... It's supposed to be a board game come to life but really, it's just a bored game.\"\n\n\"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\" was released on Digital HD on March 6, 2018 and on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on March 20, although the film was still in theaters. The Blu-ray and digital versions include two additional featurettes: \"Surviving the Jungle: Spectacular Stunts!\" and \"Book to Board Game to Big Screen & Beyond! Celebrating The Legacy of Jumanji\".\n\nDwayne Johnson, Jack Black, and Nick Jonas discussed \"Jumanji 3\" plot in interviews, including the possibility of the film exploring the origins of the game. According to Karen Gillan, the alternate ending of \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\" would have left the door open for another installment. In February 2018, it was announced that Kasdan would direct the sequel, with Rosenberg and Pinkner again writing the script and Johnson, Hart, Black, Gillan and Jonas reprising their roles. Filming will begin in January 2019. The film is slated to be released December 13, 2019.\nAccording to Kevin Hart, the sequel will have the main four stars, Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Jack Black, Nick Jonas, and himself, back. The cast and crew will start shooting for the sequel by the end of January 2019.\n\n"}

Constance is known for her taste for the sexually exotic and the ability to take an unflinching look into the sex lives of her and her clients and friends. Each episode treats the viewer to a provocative and arousing story punctuated by highly charged erotic sequences.\n\nThe series featured other notable softcore stars, including Gabriella Hall, Kim Dawson, Holly Sampson, Veronica Hart, Susan Featherly, and Shannan Leigh.\n\nThe show's name appears to be derived from \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\", a controversial novel by D.H. Lawrence published in 1928.\n\nThe show was the result of a long line of late-night cable TV erotic series such as \"Erotic Confessions\", \"\", and \"Beverly Hills Bordello\" that emerged in the middle-to-late 1990s which placed an emphasis on women-centered stories where the women were in control and could be sexually independent and become actual experts in the art and science of romance and seduction. These series also served as a virtual training ground and stable, continuous employment for many a B-actress in between their movie roles.\n\nIn early 2000, Showtime joined forces with Mainline Releasing Group (more popularly known \nas MRG Entertainment) to create a 15-episode erotic series to run on late-night weekends.(MRG had produced a similar series, \"Bedtime Stories\", for rival cable channel Cinemax.) Polly Quennel was brought in as executive producer and Rebecca Lord was brought in as director. In an effort to create a totally different lead character than the usual professional sex expert in other series, they decided to utilize the famous lead character from D. H. Lawrence's classic novel, \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" but with a more modern 21st Century, independent, sexually liberated woman.\n\nFor this series, however, Lady Chatterley would become a successful real estate broker by day, and a party girl/sex expert/faux counselor by night who would create innovative ways and means to solve her friends' sexual relationship problems...all while getting her field-playing time on her own.\n\nWhen it came time to cast the pivotal role of Lady Chatterley, a conflict arose between the President of Showtime Networks and the series creators who were supported by some of the lower-level executives at Showtime. Many actresses tried out for the lead role with it coming down to two:\nChloe Nicholle, a middle-level hardcore adult actress better known as Chloe with limited experience and even less name recognition in the B-movie/cable TV market;\nand Shauna O'Brien, January 1992 Penthouse Pet and a 10-year veteran of B-movies.\n\nThe Showtime president favored O'Brien because of her impressive qualifications and experience. She also fit into his philosophy of the erotic cable series. The series brass and lower execs \nfavored Nicholle because they thought that she would be more suitable for the pushing of erotic boundaries that they wanted to accomplish. The second group — in direct violation of the president's orders, and while he was away on company business — pulled off a coup-d'état by giving Nicholle the lead role and began filming, production, and promotion of the series. They were able to complete production of the first two episodes; however, this ended when the Showtime president returned from his trip and found out about their actions. Production stopped, Nicholle was fired and O'Brien hired to take over the lead role, taking over the role beginning with the third episode.\n\n\n"}

As with race betting, a proportion of every betting dollar is returned to the New Zealand sporting code on which the bet is taken. The choice of sports betting products included head to head, half / full-time double, winning team and margin, and more.\n\nFixed odds betting is also available on racing, through Futures books, and Final Field.\n\nIn June, 2007 Australian racing product became available to New Zealand customers through the commingling of the Australian Super TAB and New Zealand totalisator pools. More recently the Tabcorp agreement has been extended to include Australian wagering on New Zealand racing product. Commingled pools and the expansion of the New Zealand and Australian race programmes provides increased wagering opportunities for customers in both countries. The New Zealand TAB now also take betting on a selection of races from America, England, Hong Kong, Japan, France and Singapore.\n\nIn August 2011, the TAB was subject to a spam complaint with the department of internal affairs.\n\nThe New Zealand Racing Board, under the Racing Act 2003 and associated Regulations, is required to report on programmes relating to problem gambling, to provide information and advice on problem gambling and to provide problem gambling training. Since its establishment the NZ Racing Board has taken a proactive stance in meetings its responsibilities for harm prevention and minimisation. Initiatives include:\n\nRacing is a long-established sport in New Zealand, with a tradition stretching back to colonial times. Today, the New Zealand racing industry is a major contributor to the New Zealand economy as well as local communities across New Zealand. Racing generates more than $1.4 billion in economic activity each year and creates the equivalent of 18,300 full-time jobs. More than 40,000 people derive their livelihoods from the New Zealand racing industry, not to mention accommodation, travel, fashion and entertainment providers who all benefit from the industry’s economic wellbeing. More than one million people have attended race meetings across New Zealand and spent in excess of $55 million on wagering, food, beverages, transport and accommodation in a year.\n\nThere are 69 thoroughbred, 51 harness and 12 greyhound clubs licensed to race in New Zealand. Racecourses are situated in 59 locations throughout New Zealand. In the racing year from 1 August 2009 to 31 July 2010, 10,106 races were held throughout New Zealand. Further to this the New Zealand Racing Board carried 35,323 overseas races on their network, for a total of 45,439 races covered for the year, an increase of approximately 27% over the previous year.\n\nThe bloodstock industry is of international importance to New Zealand, with the export sale of horses – mainly to Australia and Asia – generating more than $120 million a year. New Zealand-bred runners compete very well overseas and regularly win major races, with a particularly good record in Australian distance races.\n\nA major source of funding for the racing industry is returns from betting on racing and sports, which is conducted by the New Zealand TAB, the retail arm of the New Zealand Racing Board.\n\nThe New Zealand Racing Board is a co-ordination point for the three racing codes. They are operated by the three governing bodies, New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing (gallops), Harness Racing New Zealand (trotting and pacing) and New Zealand Greyhound Racing.\n\nThe Judicial Control Authority (JCA), established in 1996, is the legal body that administers the rules of racing and conducts inquiries into breaches of the rules, for all three racing codes. The JCA ensures that judicial and appeal proceedings in racing are heard and decided fairly, professionally, efficiently, and in a consistent and cost effective manner. The current focus of the JCA is on contributing to consumer confidence in the racing product.\n\nThe management of the business and affairs of the New Zealand Racing Board takes place under the direction of its governing body, the Board. The seven-member board contains a representative from each of the three codes (greyhound, thoroughbred and harness racing) as well as three independent appointed Board members and the Board Chairman. \n\nCurrent members are Glenda Hughes (Independent Chair), Rod Croon (Harness Code nominee), Greg McCarthy (Thoroughbred Code nominee), Mauro Barsi (Greyhound Code nominee), Alistair Ryan (Independent Member), Graham Cooney (Independent Member) and Barry Brown (Independent Member).\n\nThe Board has formally constituted three Board committees - the Dates Committee, the Audit and Finance Committee and the Compensation and Development Committee. These committees support the Board by considering relevant issues at a suitably detailed level and reporting back to the Board.\n\nEach committee has a written charters setting out their roles and responsibilities, membership, functions, reporting procedures and the manner in which they are to operate. The structure and membership of each committee is reviewed annually.\n\nThe Dates Committee is established in accordance with section 42 of the Racing Act 2003, which requires the committee to determine, following consultation with each of the recognised industry organisations, the annual racing calendar that betting will take place on.\n\nThe Audit and Finance Committee assists the Board in discharging its responsibilities with respect to financial reporting and the financial risk management practices of the NZRB, the work and performance of the internal audit function and the NZ Racing Board’s external auditor, Deloitte.\n\nThe Compensation and Development Committee's purpose is to monitor issues and determine policies and practices related to the remuneration and review of the Chief Executive and the senior management team, as well as overseeing the management development and succession planning process.\n\nIn late November 2014 the Board of the NZ Racing Board announced the appointment of John Allen as the organisation's new CEO. John Allen commences his role in early March 2015.\n\n\n\n"}

The film is both a continuation and a spin-off from Steven Soderbergh's \"Ocean's\" trilogy and features an ensemble cast, including Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter, and Awkwafina. The film follows a group of women led by Debbie Ocean, the sister of Danny Ocean, who plan a sophisticated heist of the annual Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, United States. \n\nAfter the release of \"Ocean's Thirteen\" in 2007, Soderbergh stated he had no intentions of making a fourth film, citing his desire to have the series \"go out on top\". However, an all-female spin-off was announced in October 2015, with much of the cast signing on by August 2016. Filming took place from October 2016 to March 2017 around New York City.\n\n\"Ocean's 8\" premiered at Alice Tully Hall on June 5, 2018, and was released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on June 8, 2018, 11 years to the day of the release of \"Ocean's Thirteen\". The film has grossed over $296 million worldwide and received a lukewarm critical response, with praise for the performances of the cast (particularly Bullock, Blanchett, and Hathaway), but criticism for the storyline.\n\nFollowing her release from prison, Debbie Ocean, younger sister of the late Danny Ocean, meets with her former partner-in-crime Lou to convince her to join a heist that she planned while serving her sentence. Debbie and Lou assemble the rest of their team: Rose Weil, a disgraced fashion designer who is deeply in debt with the IRS; Amita, a jewelry maker and friend of Debbie's who is eager to move out of her mother's house and start her own life; Nine Ball, a computer hacker; Constance, a street hustler and pickpocket; and Tammy, a profiteer and another friend of Debbie's who has been secretly selling stolen goods out of her family's suburban home.\n\nDebbie plans to steal the Toussaint, a $150 million Cartier necklace, from the Met Gala in three-and-a-half weeks, and use Met Gala co-host Daphne Kluger, a famous actress known for her long neck, as an unwitting mule who will wear the necklace into the gala. The team manipulates Daphne into choosing Weil as her stylist, and Weil and Amita go to Cartier to convince them to let Daphne wear the Toussaint. They also surreptitiously digitally scan the necklace in order to manufacture a cubic zirconia duplicate.\n\nDebbie seeks out Claude Becker, an art dealer who ratted her out to the police when they were discovered for art fraud, which led to her arrest and imprisonment. Debbie manipulates Daphne to invite Becker as her date to the gala. Lou realizes that Debbie is out for revenge on Becker, but Debbie reassures her that everything will be fine.\n\nWeil discovers a flaw in the plan: The Toussaint can only be unclasped using a special magnet carried by the bodyguards hired by Cartier. Nine Ball enlists her younger sister, Veronica, to build a similar magnet in time for the gala. As the gala begins, Daphne consumes soup that Lou spiked, causing her to vomit in the restroom, where Constance takes the necklace. When the necklace is discovered to be missing, the museum is evacuated and searched; Tammy \"finds\" the duplicate necklace in order to end the search before Amita, who has retrieved the real necklace and is disassembling it, is discovered in the kitchen restroom. Amita retools the Toussaint into several pieces of jewelry, and gives them to Constance to slip to the members of the team. Debbie plants one of the parts of the necklace on Becker.\n\nSoon after the gala the necklace is returned to Cartier and identified as a fake. John Frazier, an insurance fraud investigator, arrives to investigate. Frazier, who has a history with the Ocean family, notices Debbie's presence at the gala and suspects her involvement in the heist, although he is unable to find any evidence against her. Debbie assures Frazier that she does not know where the necklace is, but she may know where part of it is. Daphne is revealed to have been in on the plan, tipped off by Weil's bad acting, and Debbie and Lou invited her in to keep her from turning them in. Daphne visits Becker for a romantic evening, and she finds the diamonds planted on him by Debbie during the gala. She sends a picture to Frazier so that he can obtain an arrest warrant, and Becker is arrested for stealing the necklace. To further frame Becker, Debbie hires actresses disguised as elderly socialites to sell pieces of the necklace and deposit the money into an account in Becker's name. \n\nAs the eight celebrate their victory, Daphne asks Debbie and Lou how all the shares could be paid from the lesser amount made from the sale of separate parts of the necklace. Lou reveals that while the gala was being evacuated, Lou and \"The Amazing\" Yen were stealing some of the Royal jewels on display during the Gala, which makes their cuts higher than expected. Each member of the team goes her separate way with her money: Amita goes to Paris with a man she met on Tinder; Weil pays off her debts and opens her own store; Constance buys a spacious loft in the city and becomes a YouTuber; Tammy expands her business in selling stolen goods; Nine Ball opens a pool bar; Daphne becomes a director; Lou goes on a cross-country road trip; and Debbie returns to Danny's grave to raise a toast to him with a martini in his honor.\n\n\nAdditionally, Dakota Fanning appears as Penelope Stern, a celebrity who Kluger is jealous of, and Nathanya Alexander appears as Veronica, Nine Ball's younger sister. Elliott Gould and Qin Shaobo reprise their roles from the previous films as Reuben Tishkoff and \"The Amazing\" Yen, respectively. Matt Damon and Carl Reiner were also set to reprise their respective characters Linus Caldwell and Saul Bloom, but their scenes were cut. Marlo Thomas, Dana Ivey, Mary Louise Wilson and Elizabeth Ashley appear as elderly actresses who help the crew shift their stolen gems. Celebrities who cameo as themselves in the film include Anna Wintour, Zayn Malik, Katie Holmes, Maria Sharapova, Serena Williams, Kim Kardashian, Adriana Lima, Desiigner, Kylie Jenner, Alexander Wang, Nina Cuso, Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, Lily Aldridge, Olivia Munn, Jaime King, Zac Posen, Hailey Baldwin, Derek Blasberg, Sofia Richie, Heidi Klum, Kelly Rohrbach, and Lauren Santo Domingo.\n\nAfter the release of \"Ocean's Thirteen\", Steven Soderbergh stated that there would not be an \"Ocean's Fourteen\", noting that George Clooney wanted \"to go out strong\" with the third film. In December 2008, Soderbergh again said that a fourth film in the franchise was unlikely, this time citing the recent death of Bernie Mac, who had appeared in the earlier films. However, a female focused spin-off starring Sandra Bullock was in development as of October 2015. Helena Bonham Carter, Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling, and Elizabeth Banks were later announced to star in the film, though Banks' presence turned out to be a rumor that did not materialize.\n\nIn August 2016, Bullock, Blanchett, Bonham Carter and Kaling were confirmed to star, with Anne Hathaway, Rihanna, Awkwafina, and Sarah Paulson closing deals to fill the cast. During production on the film, Dakota Fanning and Damian Lewis were spotted on set, with Lewis's casting being confirmed in December 2016 and Fanning confirming her casting in March 2017. However, Lewis does not appear in the finished film.\n\nOn November 11, 2016, Richard Robichaux was also cast in the film. That same month, Matt Damon stated he would appear in the film, reprising his role from the \"Ocean's Trilogy\"; however, his scene was not included in the finished film. In January 2017, James Corden joined the cast as an insurance broker who begins to grow suspicious of the group. That same month, it was revealed Anna Wintour, Alexander Wang, Zac Posen, Derek Blasberg, Lauren Santo Domingo, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Katie Holmes, Olivia Munn, Hailey Baldwin and Zayn Malik were announced to cameo in the film. That same month, Richard Armitage joined the cast of the film.\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began on October 25, 2016, in New York City. In March 2017, Blanchett said production had officially been completed.\n\nOn May 5, 2017, it was announced that filming would continue on Staten Island at the former Arthur Kill Correctional Facility, which Broadway Stages was in the process of acquiring after an initial rejection.\n\nAfter premiering at Alice Tully Hall in New York City on June 5, 2018, \"Ocean's 8\" was released by Warner Bros. to theaters in North America on June 8. \"Ocean's 8\" grossed $139.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $157.5 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $296.9 million, against a production budget of $70 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, \"Ocean's 8\" was released alongside \"Hotel Artemis\" and \"Hereditary\", and was projected to gross around $45 million from 4,145 theaters in its opening weekend, although some tracking firms had it debuting with as low as $30 million. \"Deadline Hollywood\" noted that it was tracking on-par with the 2016 all-female \"Ghostbusters\" reboot (which opened to $46 million), and had more interest from audiences than the likes of fellow female-led comedies \"The Heat\" ($39.1 million debut), \"Spy\" ($29.1 million) and \"Girls Trip\" ($31.2 million). The film made $4 million from Thursday night previews, including $100,000 from additional early screenings Wednesday night, and $15.8 million on its first day (including previews). It went on to debut to $41.6 million, the highest of the franchise, not factoring in inflation; 69% of its audience was female. In its second weekend the film made $19 million, finishing second behind newcomer \"Incredibles 2\". In its third weekend the film earned $11.7 million, finishing third behind \"\" and \"Incredibles 2\".\n\nOverseas the film was released in 16 countries alongside the United States and made $12.2 million in its opening weekend. Its largest markets were Australia ($4.7 million), Mexico ($2.6 million) and Brazil ($1.7 million). By its third week of release (where it made $26.9 million), the film had an international total of $70.9 million. Its largest markets were United Kingdom ($14 million), Australia ($13.6 million), Japan ($11.7 million), South Korea ($10.8 million), Germany ($7.4 million), Mexico ($6.3 million), and Brazil ($5.6 million).\n\n\"Ocean's 8\" was first released on Digital HD on August 21, 2018. Warner Bros. Home Entertainment then released the film on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K UHD Combo Pack on September 11, 2018. The film debuted at the top of the NPD VideoScan First Alert chart for the week ending on September 15, 2018.\n\nAccording to several media outlets, \"Ocean's 8\" received a generally lukewarm response from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 68% based on 277 reviews, and an average rating of 6.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Ocean's 8\" isn't quite as smooth as its predecessors, but still has enough cast chemistry and flair to enjoyably lift the price of a ticket from filmgoers up for an undemanding caper.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". According to BBC News, while critical reviews of the film were \"broadly positive\", \"most had some reservations\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score earned by \"Ocean's Eleven\" and \"Thirteen\".\n\nWriting for \"Rolling Stone\", Peter Travers gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and praised the cast, saying, \"\"Ocean's 8\" is a heist caper that looks gorgeous, keeps the twists coming and bounces along on a comic rhythm that's impossible to resist. What more do you want in summer escapism?\" Alonso Duralde of \"TheWrap\" called the film \"slick, charming and funny,\" though added it never quite kicks into high gear\" and said, \"Cinematographer Eigil Bryld gives the proceedings the high-gloss of a SkyMall catalog, which is appropriate for a movie about robbing a legendary Cartier necklace at fashion's most exclusive event...And between the sheen and the talented performers, \"Ocean's 8\" does eventually coast on froth and good will.\" \n\n\"Variety\"s Owen Gleiberman said it is \"clever enough to get by\" and wrote \"\"Ocean's 8\" is a casually winning heist movie, no more and no less, but like countless films devoted to the exploits of cool male criminals, it lingers most...as a proudly scurrilous gallery of role models.\" Michael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and said, \"Some movies are more about parallel play than actual playground interaction, and despite a screenful of terrifically skillful talents, \"Ocean's 8\" never quite gets its ensemble act together. It's smooth, and far from inept. But it isn't much fun. That's all you want from a certain kind of heist picture, isn't it? Fun?\"\n\nKaling and Blanchett attributed the lukewarm reception to the dominance of male critics and a lack of diversity among mainstream film reviewers. In an interview with Yahoo! Movies, Kaling cited actress Meryl Streep's criticism of Rotten Tomatoes and said, \"There is obviously an audience out there who want to watch things like [\"Ocean's 8\"], what I work on, what Sarah [Paulson] works on ... I think white men, critics would enjoy [the movie], would enjoy my work, but often I think there is a critic who will damn it in a way because they don't understand it, because they come at it at a different point of view, and they're so powerful, Rotten Tomatoes.\"\n\nSeveral film journalists strongly disagreed with claims that the reception had been dictated by the gender and ethnicity of the critics. Guy Lodge, a chief film critic for \"Variety\", highlighted the fact that several female reviewers, including Emily Yoshida from \"Vulture\" and \"Time\" magazine's Stephanie Zacharek, concurred with the general lukewarm response. Justin Chang, an Asian-American critic for the \"Los Angeles Times\", argued that film criticism needed increased diversity, but \"We negate the possibility of sympathetic imagination when we assume that someone’s particular affinity for a work of art will be dictated in advance by specifics of race, gender and age.\" He instead argued that the benefits would be a broader pool of talent and perspectives. Donald Clarke from \"The Irish Times\" pointed out that film had received a \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n"}
{"id": "710771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=710771", "title": "Oral literature", "text": "Oral literature\n\nOral literature or folk literature corresponds in the sphere of the spoken (oral) word to literature as literature operates in the domain of the written word. \n\nOral literatures forms a generally more fundamental component of culture, but operates in many ways as one might expect literature to do. The Ugandan scholar Pio Zirimu introduced the term orature in an attempt to avoid an oxymoron, but \"oral literature\" remains more common both in academic and popular writing. \n\n\"The Encyclopaedia of African Literature\", edited by Simon Gikandi (Routledge, 2003), gives this definition: \"Orature means something passed on through the spoken word, and because it is based on the spoken language it comes to life only in a living community. Where community life fades away, orality loses its function and dies. It needs people in a living social setting: it needs life itself.\"\n\nIn \"Songs and Politics in Eastern Africa\", edited by Kimani Njogu and Hervé Maupeu (2007), it is stated (page 204) that Zirimu, who coined the term, defines orature as \"the use of utterance as an aesthetic means of expression\" (as quoted by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, 1988). According to the book \"Defining New Idioms and Alternative Forms of Expression\", edited by Eckhard Breitinger (Rodopi, 1996, page 78): \"This means that any 'oral society' had to develop means to make the spoken word last, at least for a while. We tend to regard all the genres of orature as belonging to the homogeneous complex of folklore.\"\n\nPre-literate societies, by definition, have no written literature, but may possess rich and varied oral traditions—such as folk epics, folklore, proverbs and folksong—that effectively constitute an oral literature. Even when these are collected and published by scholars such as folklorists and paremiographers, the result is still often referred to as \"oral literature\". The different genres of oral literature pose classification challenges to scholars because of cultural dynamism in the modern digital age. \n\nLiterate societies may continue an oral tradition — particularly within the family (for example bedtime stories) or informal social structures. The telling of urban legends may be considered an example of oral literature, as can jokes and also oral poetry including slam poetry which has been a televised feature on Russell Simmons' \"Def Poetry\"; performance poetry is a genre of poetry that consciously shuns the written form.\n\nLore is seen in societies with vigorous oral conveyance practices to be a general term inclusive of both oral literature and any written literature, including sophisticated writings, as well, potentially, as visual and performance arts which may interact with these forms, extend their expression, or offer additional expressive media. Thus even where no phrase in local language which exactly translates \"oral literature\" is used, what constitutes \"oral literature\" as understood today is already understood to be part or all of the lore media with which a society conducts profound and common cultural affairs among its members, orally. In this sense, oral lore is an ancient practice and concept natural to the earliest storied communications and transmissions of bodies of knowledge and culture in verbal form near the dawn of language-based human societies, and 'oral literature' thus understood was putatively recognized in times prior to recordings of history in non-oral media including painting and writing.\n\nOral literature as a concept, after CE 19th century antecedents, was more widely circulated by Hector Munro Chadwick and Nora Kershaw Chadwick in their comparative work on the \"growth of literature\" (1932–40). In 1960, Albert B. Lord published \"The Singer of Tales\" (1960), which influentially examined fluidity in both ancient and later texts and \"oral-formulaic\" principles being used during composition-in-performance, particularly by contemporary Eastern European bards relating long traditional narratives.\n\nFrom the 1970s, the term \"Oral literature\" appears in the work of both literary scholars and anthropologists: Finnegan (1970, 1977), Görög-Karady (1982), Bauman (1986) and in the articles of the journal \"Cahiers de Littérature Orale\".\n\nAlthough deaf people communicate manually rather than orally, their culture and traditions are considered in the same category as oral literature. Stories, jokes and poetry are passed on from person to person with no written medium.\n\n\n\n"}

As the Pegasus Bronze Saint, Koga embarks on a journey to increase his power to save Athena while meeting some other Saints. For the second season, the series tells the conflict between Athena and her sister Pallas which starts a new war. The series also got a manga adaptation and a fighting game.\n\n\"Omega\" was created as an alternative to the series' direct sequel \"\" due to lack of material to adapt. As a result, rather than refocusing on the returning cast, Toei created a new generation of Saints who would succeed the old cast. Critical reception to the series has been mixed with critics often finding it derivative from other shows from the same genre.\n\nThe storyline of \"Omega\" takes place 25 years after the Holy Wars of the 20th century narrated in the original manga and its anime adaptation. The goddess Athena is still on Earth after reincarnating to continue her duty of protecting peace against several antagonistic deities. Athena and a new generation of Saints prepare to face new threats that lurks in this new era, in which Pegasus Seiya, the protagonist of Kurumada's manga, is revered as a Saint of legend and one of Athena's Gold Saints.\n\nThe first part of the series is the , introducing the new Pegasus Saint Koga and his friends Dragon Ryuhou, Lionet Souma, Wolf Haruto, Aquila Yuna and Aria, and the beginning of their fight against the God of War Mars in his quest to capture Aria to become the new Athena. The second part is the , featuring Koga and his friends who decides to fight against the many Gold Saints who have aligned themselves with Mars in their fight to save Athena before it is too late, eventually being accompanied by Orion Eden.\n\nThe second season begins the , introducing Athena's new enemy Pallas and her Pallasite warriors, a new ally in the Steel Saint Subaru, and new powers with their stronger New Cloths. The second half of season 2 comprises the , where Athena and her many Saints take their war with Pallas to her stronghold Pallasvelda, where Pallas's elite Pallasites begin to conspire against her.\n\nAs an installment separate from Kurumada's work, the series will introduce characters new to the \"Saint Seiya\" fictional universe, that will make use of elements already established within it. Some of them, such as the deities, exist in the original manga. Additionally, known elements from \"Saint Seiya\", such as the Cloths, the armors worn by the Saints, bear their known constellations, but are presented in \"Omega\" with a new design that differs substantially from those in the original source material, and departing from it, the Cloths emerge from jewels worn by the characters to envelop their bodies, which are known in \"Omega\" as .\n\nThe Cosmo essence, one of the basic concepts of \"Saint Seiya\", is expanded in \"Omega\" with the addition of specific elemental properties: , , , , , and .\n\nIn the second season, several Saints including the main characters have their cloths upgraded, sporting a new design much more reminiscent of Kurumada's original designs, and are stored in special boxes like in the original continuity.\n\nOriginally, Toei planned to make an anime adaptation of the manga \"\" but the series' slow pace of release resulted in them trying the opposite of \"Next Dimension\": A story set several years after the events of the original manga. For this they created a new cast of main characters who would be assisted by the previous generation's Saints.\n\nThe creative staff, including character designer Umakoshi and head writer Reiko Yoshida, previously worked under flagship \"Saint Seiya\" director Shigeyasu Yamauchi, either on the original \"Saint Seiya\" anime adaptation (director Morio Hatano was assistant director of its ), or on his other works, such as \"\" and \"Casshern Sins\".

Original \"Saint Seiya\" author Kurumada is not involved in the creative process of \"Omega\", thus he is credited as the original creator of the series' concept.\n\nCritical reception to the series has been mixed with critics often finding it derivative from other shows from the same genre. Bamboo Dong from Anime News Network said \"Saint Seiya Omega is your archetypal hero tale, in which someone finds his true calling for justice, and together, he and his friends band together, embrace friendship, and vanquish evil from the world.\" Fandom Post's Sean Connolly \"Saint Seiya Omega is a good entry point into the franchise for those who have never tried it out.\" Like Dong, Connolly found the series derivatve of the genre but noted it had potential to be entertaining.\n\nVictoria Holden from \"Otaku USA\" listed \"Omega\" as her favorite anime from 2012 noting that despite its lighter elements, different character designs and comedic elements, she enjoys the characterization from the main cast in their growth into Saints. The updated character designs and the new elements not seen in the classic series made Holden note that \"Omega\" managed to attract a new generation of fans. Seiya's voice actor, Toru Furuya, commented that thanks to \"Omega\"s success in Japan, several new projects related with \"Saint Seiya\" would begin.\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that the \"Omega\" animated series would be adapted to manga form, and it started serialization on March 26, 2013, in Kadokawa Shoten's \"Kerokero Ace\" magazine. The comic book contains the arcs of the first season and it also adapted the second season. Its only \"tankōbon\" volume was released on September 23, 2013.\n\nBandai released a fighting game titled \"Saint Seiya Omega - Ultimate Cosmo\" on November 29, 2012 for the PlayStation Portable. Additionally, the release of a set of chibi PVC figures portraying the Bronze Saints, has been announced. A line of articulated figures by Bandai under the name \"S.H.Figuarts\" was also announced, with Pegasus Kōga as the first character to be released. Although a prototype of the second figure in the line, Orion Eden, was created and displayed, it was ultimately never released, with the entire line cancelled thereafter.\n\nAlso from Bandai, a set of playing cards titled \"Saint Seiya Omega\", for their \"Crusade Card System\" series has been announced for a June 2012 release\n\nAdditionally, the first release of \"Saint Seiya Omega\" on DVD and Blu-ray disc was set for August 24, 2012.

{"id": "21703042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21703042", "title": "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark", "text": "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark\n\nSpider-Man: Turn Off the Dark is a musical with music and lyrics by Bono and The Edge, and a book by Julie Taymor and Glen Berger, with revisions by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa.\n\nThe musical is based on the Spider-Man comics created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, published by Marvel Comics, as well as the 2002 film and the Greek myth of Arachne. It tells Spider-Man's origin story, his romance with Mary Jane and his battles with the Green Goblin. The show includes highly technical stunts, such as aerial combat scenes and actors swinging from \"webs\".\n\nThe Broadway production was notorious for its many troubles. Several actors were injured performing stunts and the opening night was repeatedly pushed back to give the creative team more time to work, causing some critics to review the 'unfinished' production in protest. Following negative reviews, \"Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark\" suspended performances for a month to retool the show. Long-time \"Spider-Man\" comics writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa was brought in to revise the story and book. Director Julie Taymor, whose vision had driven the concept of the musical, was replaced by creative consultant Philip William McKinley. By the time \"Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark\" officially opened on June 14, 2011, it had set the record for the longest preview period in Broadway history – 182 performances.\n\nCritical reception of the opening was better than for the previews, but mixed, with praise for the visual effects but little enthusiasm for the book and score. \"Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark\" is the most expensive Broadway production in history, and also once held the box office record for Broadway sales in one week, taking in $2.9 million over nine performances. The production closed on January 4, 2014.\n\nAlthough often described as a rock musical, the production \"treads new ground\" that some commentators have asserted \"have effectively distanced it from its peers—and caused some confusion when it comes time to describe the show.\" The Edge stated that he is unsure of what description to use for the production, because \"It is elements of rock and roll, it's elements of circus, it's elements of opera, [and] of musical theater.\" Bono, admitting that his description is a little \"pretentious,\" has referred to it as \"pop-up, pop-art opera,\" noting that Julie Taymor is calling it a \"rock-and-roll circus drama.\" Bono has also described the production as \"wrestling with the same stuff\" as \"Rilke, Blake, \"Wings of Desire\", Roy Lichtenstein, [and] the Ramones.\" A \"60 Minutes\" CBS special stated that it is being called a \"comic book rock opera circus,\" although in that segment Bono noted that even using \"rock\" to describe the music is too narrow a description, because \"We've moved out of the rock and roll idiom in places into some very new territory for us ... [including] big show tunes and dance songs.\"\n\nThe production was described early on as \"the most technically complex show ever on Broadway, with 27 aerial sequences of characters flying\" and engaging in aerial combat. The production also includes a \"multitude of moving set pieces that put the audience in the middle of the action,\" and enough projections onto giant screens that Bono has said that it is like a three-dimensional graphic novel. The original story treated the origins of Spider-Man similarly to the story in the 2002 film, but wove in an involved story about a villain based on the mythological Arachne. A \"geek chorus\" of four teenagers narrated the story. In the rewritten version, the plot hews closer to the comic book and film and trims and transforms the role of Arachne into a \"kindred spirit in Spider-Man's dreams\".\n\n\"Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark\" had no out-of-town tryouts because of the technical requirements of the production, which were designed for the Foxwoods Theatre on Broadway. The musical began previews at that theatre on November 28, 2010. After many delays, the official opening gala night took place on June 14, 2011.\n\nThe creative team originally included director Taymor and choreographer Daniel Ezralow, with scenic design by George Tsypin, costume design by Eiko Ishioka and lighting design by Donald Holder. An \"expanded creative team\", announced on March 9, 2011, includes Philip William McKinley, joining the production as \"consultant\" (when Taymor left the production). It also includes the addition of Chase Brock for additional choreography and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa for additional writing. Taymor retained her original credits in \"Spider-Man\".\n\nThe opening night cast featured Reeve Carney as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Jennifer Damiano as Mary Jane Watson, Patrick Page as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, T. V. Carpio as Arachne, Michael Mulheren as J. Jonah Jameson, Ken Marks as Uncle Ben, Isabel Keating as Aunt May, Jeb Brown as Mary Jane's Father, Matt Caplan as school bully Flash Thompson, and Laura Beth Wells as Osborn's wife Emily. Due to the physical demands of the role, Carney performs in six of the eight performances each week. The original alternate was British actor Matthew James Thomas, who left the show in November 2012 to star in \"Pippin\".\n\nOn November 19, 2013, producers announced that the show would close on January 4, 2014, citing falling ticket sales and no longer being able to get injury insurance for the production as reasons for closure. Having run on Broadway for over three years, the production failed to make back its $75 million cost, the largest in Broadway history, with investors reportedly losing $60 million.\n\nWhen announcing the show's closure on Broadway, it was announced the show would transfer to Las Vegas. The show's producer Michael Cohl said of the transfer, \"We'll work on improving everything, It could be anything. It's a blank piece of paper.\"\n\nIn 2012, the musical's producers confirmed that they were scouting theatres in Europe, after \"The New York Post\" reported that they were considering productions in arenas in London and Hamburg.\n\nOn July 25, 2014, Cohl announced that the musical will set out on an arena tour in place of the previous announced production in Las Vegas and would be launched in late 2015 or winter of 2016. As of November 2018, the tour has not begun.\n\n\"The following is a synopsis of the show as it was performed in its preview period from November 28, 2010, to April 17, 2011. Various changes were made throughout this period, however.\"\n\nAs the curtain rises New York City is burning (\"Splash Page\"). Mary Jane Watson is seen suspended from the Brooklyn Bridge, and Spider-Man is running to save her. He is too late, as the Green Goblin depicted as a comic book cut out, slashes the rope. As Mary Jane falls, Spider-Man makes a leap, and is tethered, frozen in a comic book panel snapshot, as citizens chant the emblem of the original version, \"And the boy... falls... from... the... sky...\" We are now in the present where the Geek Chorus (Miss Arrow, Jimmy-6, Professor Cobwell, and Grim Hunter) enters. They are in the process of \"writing\" the most extreme and ultimate Spider-Man story. Miss Arrow contends that Peter Parker isn't actually the first person to become a spider. She begins to tell the story of Arachne (\"Behold and Wonder\"), as depicted weaving a huge tapestry on the stage with her weavers. She was an Ancient Greek weaver who challenged Athena, the Goddess of Weaving, to a duel; Arachne who wove blasphemous images in her tapestry to mock the gods, won but was punished for her hubris by Athena, who destroyed her work with a crack of a lightning bolt. Arachne was so distraught, she hanged herself. Athena felt guilty, so she gave her eternal life in the form of the world's first spider, doomed to weave in the shadows forever, never more in the light.\n\nThe scene dissolves into Queens High School where Peter Parker is presenting an oral report on Arachne. His questions prompt the teacher to assign the entire class a ten-page report, which they must work on over the weekend. As revenge, his ex-best friend Flash Thompson and the other bullies at the school begin to physically and verbally abuse Peter (\"Bullying by Numbers\"). He walks home beaten and alone, until he runs into his next door neighbor, crush, and Flash's girlfriend, Mary Jane. They each go into their separate homes and have arguments with their guardians: Mary Jane's father tries to beat her, while Peter feels his Uncle Ben is trying to replace his dead father. Peter has been living with Uncle Ben and Aunt May ever since his parents died. Both teenagers long for escape (\"No More\").\n\nThe next day, the class goes on a field trip to the laboratory of Dr. Norman Osborn, who is performing genetic experiments which involve splicing different gene traits from different animals together. He explains the need to speed up evolution (\"D.I.Y. World\") to make the world a more perfect place and shows off his prime specimen: a large female spider. Unfortunately, the spider is missing; it turns up moments later and bites Peter. The action is interrupted again by the Geek Chorus, who argue why Peter was bitten; some believe it was fate, some believe he was chosen by the spider, and some believe it was a case of him simply being in the spider's path.\n\nBack in the story, Peter is discovering his new spider powers: climbing on the ceiling, shooting webs, and using his new found agility and strength to give a beating back to the bullies (\"Bouncing Off the Walls\"). Unfortunately his new powers don't impress Mary Jane, who drives off with Flash in his new car. Peter believes that if he can afford a car, he'll be able to earn MJ's love; he enters an amateur wrestling contest and defeats champion Bonesaw McGraw for the $1,000 prize. On his way home he sees Flash going into MJ's house; soon after someone steals his new car, but Peter refuses to stop him. Uncle Ben sees the thief and runs after him, only to be killed by the speeding motorist. Ashamed of his recent selfishness and powerless to save his uncle, he goes to his room to grieve; Arachne sees him and shares in his pain (\"Rise Above\"). She gives him a costume made with the colors she described: \"For every heart that bleeds, will color your world \"red\" and the sorrow in the night, will be the \"blue\" you cannot shed.\" Peter copes with his uncle's death and wish to \"Rise Above\" by swinging through the city breaking up crimes as \"Spider-Man\" (\"NY Debut\"). Editor of the Daily Bugle J. Jonah Jameson thinks he's a menace and offers cash for whoever can manage to get pictures of him; Peter takes on the job as Spider-Man's personal photographer.\n\nBack at the laboratory, the U.S. military tries to convince Osborn to speed up his experiments and create new genes to be spliced into people, so that they can be used as fighting machines in war times (\"Pull the Trigger\"). Osborn decides he will try the new experiment on himself first, with the help of his wife. Meanwhile, MJ is impressed by Peter's new status at the Daily Bugle, and the two discuss their plans after high school: MJ wants to be an actress and Peter wants to be a photographer. They flirt, while Osborn and his wife prepare the gene splicer for the new experiment (\"Picture This\"). The machine goes haywire and Osborn's wife is killed, while he is transformed into the Green Goblin. To avenge his wife's death, Osborn begins murdering the lab techs and takes the military men hostage; Spider-Man intervenes and saves them, but Osborn knows it is Peter; after all, it was his spider who bit him. The Green Goblin kidnaps MJ and tells Spider Man to meet him atop the Chrysler Building, via a piano solo (\"I'll Take Manhattan\"). Spider-Man accepts, and the two have an epic battle over the audience. The Geek Chorus interrupts, wondering how they can get Spider-Man to defeat his foe; they decide that MJ has been attached to the piano and the Green Goblin pushes it over the side. He gets caught in it and falls to his death, while Spider-Man saves MJ. As he brings her down, they kiss and she asks who he is. He responds, \"I'm your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man,\" and swings off into the night. An image of Arachne is barely visible above them, as MJ sings \"And the girl falls from the sky.\"\n\nThe Geek Chorus enters and informs the audience that Spider-Man has defeated his ultimate enemy, so their story is complete. Miss Arrow is convinced that they are not finished, because Spider-Man's real ultimate enemy should be unbeatable. So they introduce several villains which Spider-Man dispatches: Carnage, Swarm, Kraven the Hunter, Electro, The Lizard, and Swiss Miss (whom Miss Arrow invents on the spot). Throughout this super villain parade, we also learn that Peter and MJ have formed a relationship. With all of these villains afoot, Peter is exhausted and not paying much attention to her or anyone else in his life (\"Spider-Man Rising\"). As Peter sleeps one night, Arachne invades his dreams. She realizes that she will no longer be alone now that there is another spider to share her darkness (\"Turn Off the Dark\"). She begins to weave illusions in his mind, and Peter can't tell the difference between the dream and reality when he awakes. MJ becomes completely fed up with Peter's constant lateness and disregard for her after he does not show up for her new play (\"Walk Away\"). That night, he decides to abandon Spider-Man forever.\n\nThe Daily Bugle finds Peter's suit thrown in the trash and runs a headline about Spider-Man disappearing. Arachne reads this and becomes enraged (\"Think Again\"). She devises a plan to bring Spider-Man back by having all of his former enemies descend on the city at once. The Geek Chorus interrupts, citing the fact that they are all dead. Arachne's furies then take over the script-writing and scare the Chorus away. Peter and MJ enjoy a night out dancing, now that Peter has no real commitments to Spider Man and is back in school doing well. Suddenly, the power goes out; then the walls of the club come alive with the image of the Green Goblin, apparently alive and wreaking havoc. The villains destroy the city piece by piece, yet still Spider-Man does not appear (\"Sinistereo\").\n\nArachne is upset that Spider-Man has not taken her bait, and she visits him in another dream in which the two of them get married. When that does not work, she uses a headline in the Daily Bugle about 50 stolen pairs of shoes to weasel her way into the office of J. Jonah Jameson. Her furies steal the shoes for themselves and descend upon Jameson (\"Deeply Furious\"). Arachne convinces him to run a headline pronouncing Spider-Man a needed hero, and he does. After enjoying the blackout and its intimacy, MJ and Peter come to a standstill: because of the dreams and the added pressure of needing Spider-Man, Peter doesn't think he can be good enough for MJ anymore. She assures him that he is all she needs in the world (\"If the World Should End\"). On a path of soul-searching, Peter realizes that if MJ loves him then he can go on being Spider-Man; he finds his inner hero and vanquishes the Sinister Six (\"The Boy Falls From the Sky\").\n\nArachne kidnaps Mary Jane, and the Geek Chorus appears once again. They argue about who Spider-Man's true nemesis is, the one he can never beat, with some thinking it must be MJ. But Miss Arrow assures them that it is Arachne, since she is an expert of weaving illusion. Back in the story, we see that Miss Arrow is right: Arachne has trapped Peter in her giant web. MJ is suspended in a cocoon and will die unless Peter pledges to be with Arachne, to share her darkness forever (\"Love Me or Kill Me*\"). They fight, and eventually Peter agrees to be with Arachne if it means saving MJ. Arachne has a sudden change of heart, realizing that there is still humanity left in the curse of the spider. She finds her own humanity and spares MJ's life. Arachne spares Peter of a life with her, as she knows he will always only love MJ and will never truly be hers; but in realizing his humanity, she has found her own and is released of her burden of darkness in the shadows. Peter watches as Arachne ascends into the heavens by the same piece of thread she used to take her life. With his suit at the Daily Bugle, MJ sees Peter and finally realizes his secret. She agrees to stand by him as sirens begin wailing and Peter swings away (\"Finale\").\n\n\n\"The following is a synopsis of the show as it was performed in its official run from June 14, 2011 to January 4, 2014.\"\n\nAt Midtown High School in Queens, New York, local teenager Peter Parker gives a book report about Arachne, Goddess of the Weavers (\"The Myth of Arachne\"). As Peter gives his report, Arachne descends to the stage and tells the audience her story (\"Behold and Wonder\"). Thousands of years ago, Arachne was a skilled weaver who became conceited and boasted that she was greater than the goddess Athena, who challenged Arachne to a weaving contest. During the contest, Arachne created blasphemous images of the gods. Furious, Athena destroyed Arachne's work. Devastated, Arachne hanged herself, but Athena took pity on Arachne and transformed her into the world's first spider. Now Arachne is cursed to wander the universe and weave her web for all eternity.\n\nAfter class ends, Peter's ex-best friend Flash Thompson and his gang gleefully torment the straight A student (\"Bullying by Numbers\"). Peter has a crush on his popular next door neighbor Mary Jane Watson, but they both have unhappy lives: Mary Jane has an abusive father and suffers at home while Peter suffers the torment of bullies at school (\"No More\"). Peter has lived with Uncle Ben and Aunt May ever since his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash when he was a baby. A few days later, Peter and classmates go on a field trip to the genetics laboratory of scientist Norman Osborn and his wife Emily, who explain what they hope to accomplish with their genetic research (\"D.I.Y. World\"). While Peter takes pictures of the lab for the school newspaper, the Osborns put the whole lab on lockdown as a dangerous genetically altered spider has escaped. While the students and scientists panic, the spider lowers itself onto Peter's shoulder and bites him (\"Venom\").\n\nPeter soon becomes aware that, as a result of the spider's bite, he has spider-like powers along with a muscular physique, 20/20 vision and the ability to emit web strings from his wrists. He uses his powers at school to defeat Flash and his friends in a fistfight (\"Bouncing Off the Walls\"). After seeing Flash give Mary Jane a ride, Peter decides to buy a car to impress her. He enters a wrestling tournament, where he defeats champion Bonesaw McGraw for the grand prize of $1,000. Peter returns home only to learn that Uncle Ben has been shot by a carjacker. Ashamed of his recent selfishness and realizing he's powerless to save his dying uncle, Peter has an emotional encounter with Aunt May unaware that Arachne is watching over him. Arachne encourages him to use his gift to defend the innocent from evil (\"Rise Above\"). Peter vows to avenge Uncle Ben's death by using his powers to save the world and notes that \"with great power comes great responsibility\".\n\nPeter then makes a costume with the colors that Arachne described to him (red for every heart of the innocent that bleeds, and blue for the sorrow of endangered citizens) before swinging through the city on his webs, fighting criminals and saving innocent civilians as \"Spider-Man\" (\"NY Debut\"). The \"Daily Bugle\" begins to publish articles about Spider-Man while Peter is hired by editor-in-chief J. Jonah Jameson as a freelance photojournalist. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn begins thinking that Spider-Man stole his research as the military organization Viper Worldwide presses him to accelerate his project (\"Pull the Trigger\"). Norman contemplates the dilemma with Emily while Peter shares his first romantic moment with Mary Jane (\"Picture This\"). Norman decides to experiment on himself, causing an electrical surge that results in Emily's accidental death. Norman goes insane and mutates into the \"Green Goblin\".\n\nThe Green Goblin comes up with a plan to genetically alter other humans as he did himself (\"A Freak Like Me Needs Company\"). Through his experiments on his former employees, he manages to create six villains: Carnage, Electro, Kraven the Hunter, Lizard, Swarm, and Swiss Miss. That night, Mary Jane tells Peter that her love for him has grown and he admits that the feeling is mutual (\"If the World Should End\"). The Goblin and his new alliance of criminals – calling themselves the \"Sinister Six\" – go on a rampage through New York (\"Sinistereo\"). Spider-Man quickly defeats the Sinister Six as the citizens of New York cheer him on (\"Spider-Man!\"), unaware that the Goblin has managed to escape. The Goblin arrives at the headquarters of the \"Daily Bugle\" and tells Jameson to print his plans of dominating the world through genetic mutation. The Goblin also tells Jameson that he gave Spider-Man life, making Jameson believe Spider-Man is in league with the Goblin and therefore giving Spider-Man an even worse image from the \"Bugle\". Later that night, Arachne comes to Peter in a vision and explains that she is his guardian along with the reminder that being a hero is his destiny and he cannot escape it (\"Turn Off the Dark\").\n\nMaligned by the media and suffering financial woes, Peter wants to spend more time with Mary Jane after missing the opening night of her play and begins considering to take time off from fighting crime. Upset over Peter's constant excuses and not wanting to lose the best friend she ever had, Mary Jane suggests they take a break from their relationship (\"I Just Can't Walk Away (Say It Now)\"). Hurt, Peter decides not to resume his heroic acts as Spider-Man and gives his costume to J. Jonah Jameson, telling him that Spider-Man has quit. He later takes Mary Jane to a night club and impulsively proposes to her. While there, the Green Goblin intercepts the city's TV signals and sends a message to Spider-Man threatening his loved ones. Peter takes Mary Jane to his apartment and breaks off their relationship for good so that his enemies won't target her. After telling Mary Jane that he will always love her, Peter takes a walk and realizes that he needs to be a hero not only for Mary Jane but for the world (\"The Boy Falls From the Sky\"). Spider-Man then recovers his costume from the \"Daily Bugle\" and goes after the Green Goblin.\n\nThe Green Goblin sits at a piano at the top of the Chrysler Building and humorously boasts to the audience of his plan to destroy New York City (\"I'll Take Manhattan\"). Spider-Man arrives ready to fight, but is soon unmasked when the Goblin reveals he knows Spider-Man's true identity. Peter attempts to revive the good-natured Norman within the Goblin, but to no avail. Peter engages the Goblin in combat, but before he can finish him the Goblin reveals that he has Mary Jane, who now dangles from the Chrysler Building. A flying battle over the audience takes place and when it seems all hope is lost, Spider-Man webs the Green Goblin to his piano. The Green Goblin, not realizing this, thrusts the piano over the side of the Chrysler Building, taking him down to his death. After Spider-Man saves Mary Jane, she tells him not to leave and reveals that she has guessed who he is. Peter removes his mask and they embrace. The two contemplate their new life together before sirens begin wailing and Spider-Man swings away (\"Finale: A New Dawn\").\n\nAct I:\nAct II:\n\nAccording to the \"New York Post\", Bono began composing \"Spider-Man\" after Andrew Lloyd Webber joked, \"I'd like to thank rock musicians for leaving me alone for 25 years – I've had the theater all to myself\"; Bono and Taymor \"decided to give Andrew a little competition\".\n\nIn August 2002, Marvel announced that Tony Adams would produce a stage musical based on the Spider-Man comics. Adams approached Bono and The Edge to be involved with the project; in turn, they enlisted Taymor to direct. In October 2005, Adams suffered a stroke while the creative team was assembled to sign contracts; he died two days later. Patrick Healy in \"The New York Times\" described their situation:\n\nReadings of the musical were held beginning in 2007, but the production was delayed several times. By early 2009, the Broadway production ran $25 million into debt, the \"New York Post\" reported, and work on it was suspended. The budget for the project was reported in March 2009 to be a record-setting $52 million. On August 31, 2009, The Walt Disney Company announced plans to buy Marvel Comics. Despite the previous Broadway success of their Disney Theatrical Productions subsidiary, Disney made no move to assume control of \"Spider-Man\", or help the production financially. In late 2009, Bono asked Michael Cohl to step in as producer, and by May 2010 Cohl had raised the money to proceed with the project, much of it from Jeremiah J. Harris, former Chairman of Live Nation, who is also listed as a producer. Meanwhile, the musical was eventually scheduled to open at the Foxwoods Theatre on February 18, 2010, but the production was delayed again until fundraising could be completed.\n\nBy November 2010, the production was estimated to cost $65 million. In addition, the show's unusually high running costs were reported to be about $1 million per week. A new opening night of December 21, 2010 was scheduled, but this was delayed until January 2011, reportedly due to \"a tremendous amount of creative commotion behind the scenes\" as more time for rehearsals was needed. In December 2010, the official opening was again pushed back, to February 2011, \"to provide more time for the creators to stage a new final number, make further rewrites to the dialogue and consider adding and cutting scenes and perhaps inserting new music. ... Ms. Taymor and the producers have concluded that Act II has storytelling problems that need to be fixed.\" A \"final postponement\" was made once again, pushing the opening to March 15, 2011, in order to \"allow Taymor to fine-tune the production and instate a new ending\".\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported that the show's opening would be delayed for the sixth time, until summer 2011. This latest delay included a shutdown of previews. The shutdown lasted from April 19 to May 11, 2011, in order for the new creative team to implement changes; preview performances resumed May 12. In March, Cohl and Harris said they shut down previews because they felt \"the story needed some work, the songs needed some work, and the sound needed some work\", and that they \"were going to concentrate on those three areas over the next three and a half weeks.\" They also announced that injured Spider-Man stunt performer Christopher Tierney would be rejoining the show. By April 2011 the capitalization was reported to have grown to $70 million, and as of the opening, it was reported as $75 million, compared to the typical $5 to $15 million for a Broadway musical. It included $9.7 million for sets and costumes, $4.4 million to rent the Foxwoods Theatre for two years before performances began, and $2.2 million for flying equipment. The weekly production budget was $1.3 million.\n\nEvan Rachel Wood and Alan Cumming were cast as Mary Jane Watson and the Green Goblin, respectively, in June 2009, but Wood left in March 2010 and Cumming the following month when the show was delayed. The new original cast was announced on August 16, 2010. During early previews Mat Devine, Gideon Glick, Alice Lee and Jonathan Schwartz played a group of characters known as the \"Geek Chorus\". After revisions, the characters were cut from the show.\n\nIn February 2011, playwright Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa was asked by the producers \"to help rewrite the script\". He had written several stories for Spider-Man comic books and had revised the book for a production of \"It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman\". On February 21, 2011, Paul Bogaev (a 2004 nominee for a Tony Award for Best Orchestrations) was hired \"as a consultant to help improve the performance, vocal and orchestration arrangements, and sound quality of the songs and numbers.\"\n\nIn early March 2011, \"Playbill\" and \"The New York Times\" reported that the producers had considered whether to \"work with an expanded creative team\" or have Taymor leave the production. Soon thereafter, Taymor left the production. Philip William McKinley joined the show as \"consultant\", and Chase Brock joined as an additional choreographer.\n\n six people have been injured while working on \"Spider-Man\". After two stunt doubles were injured during various flying sequences in rehearsals, safety inspectors from the New York State Department of Labor reviewed these scenes in the show and, in February 2011, cited the show for two workplace safety violations. The United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the show $12,600 in March 2011 for three serious safety violations. The Actors' Equity Association also looked into the incidents. One of the injuries occurred when Spider-Man stunt double Kevin Aubin broke both wrists. Another actor \"had broken [his] feet on the same move a month earlier.\"\n\nNatalie Mendoza, who was originally cast as Arachne, suffered a concussion during the first preview performance on November 28, 2010, when she was struck in the head by equipment in the wings. She did not report the accident to producers until November 30. She appeared in the second performance against her doctor's advice; the role involves several flying sequences, including one in which she is spun upside-down. Mendoza later felt ill, and America Olivo, her understudy, played the role during her nearly two-week absence. Mendoza returned to the show for the December 15 evening performance. Following the preview of December 20, 2010, when Spider-Man stunt performer Christopher Tierney was injured and hospitalized, Mendoza suspended her performance, Olivo again filling in for her. On December 30, she announced her permanent withdrawal from the show. She was replaced by T. V. Carpio, with Olivo remaining as understudy. When Carpio was injured in March 2011 and withdrew from the show for two weeks, Olivo performed the role again.\n\nIn that December 20 preview, Tierney fell more than off a piece of scenery when his harness was not connected to the safety cord, leaving him to freefall through the stage and into the orchestra pit. Tierney was hospitalized at Bellevue Hospital Center; he was released for rehabilitation on December 28. The December 20 performance was ended prematurely. After rehearsals for stricter safety procedures involving the harnesses, the show resumed with the evening performance on December 23. Tierney was released from New York University's Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine on January 5, 2011. He returned to the show for rehearsals on April 25, 2011 and performed in the show on opening night. Carpio was injured during a March 16 performance, reportedly hurting her neck, and left the show for two weeks.\n\nOn August 15, 2013, actor Daniel Curry was hurt by apparently being pinned under a piece of equipment and suffered leg trauma.\n\nOn September 10, 2010, Carney and his band performed \"Boy Falls from the Sky\" on \"Good Morning America\". Carney, Bono, and The Edge all performed on the May 25, 2011, final episode of \"American Idol\" Season 10 at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, singing \"Rise Above.\" Carney and Damiano performed \"If The World Should End\" on the 65th Tony Awards telecast in June 2011.\n\nThe show has twice appeared on \"Late Show with David Letterman\". On March 2, 2011, the cast performed \"Rise Above\", as featured in Julie Taymor's version. On July 18, 2011, the cast, led by Patrick Page, performed \"A Freak Like Me Needs Company\".\n\nA short performance of this show was featured in the 2011 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, with Spider-Man battling villains, while the ensemble performed a medley of \"Bouncing Off the Walls\", \"A Freak Like Me Needs Company\", and \"Spider-Man!\".\n\nSyfy was \"Turn Off the Dark\"'s lead media partner, offering tickets to the show as prizes and airing commercials for the production. CBS' \"60 Minutes\" aired a feature on the production on November 28, 2010, the production's first preview performance, in which Lesley Stahl chronicled the creation of the musical.\n\nThe show's first performance, on November 28, 2010, \"garnered what was most likely the most press coverage of a first preview in history.\" Reactions to the first preview described the musical as \"visually stunning,\" despite technical glitches that resulted in several stops and starts during the performance. By January 18, 2011, a reviewer reported that there were no delays during the preview he saw. He praised the stunts and ballads \"that evoke the yearning grandeur of U2 – though their more upbeat material tended to be nondescript\" but felt that the \"plot of the second act twisted into tangled knots.\" Radio and TV talkshow host Glenn Beck championed the production after attending the preview showings several times.\n\nMost of the major theater critics published their reviews of the first version on February 7, 2011; nearly all of them were strongly negative in tone. Although reviews during the preview period are unusual, the critics decided that the ever-expanding preview period was so long, and ticket prices were so high, that they should not wait for the official opening. An analysis in \"The New York Review of Books\" by classics scholar Daniel Mendelsohn followed up the complaints of other critics that Taymor's attempt to graft the classical myth of Arachne onto the comic book story turned the show into \"a grotesque hybrid\" and overloaded the plot with two unrelated main villains in Arachne and Green Goblin. Mendelsohn saw\n\nIn a scathing review of the first version, \"The New York Times\" critic Ben Brantley had said that \"Spider-Man\" may \"rank among the worst\" Broadway musicals. In his review of the revised version, Brantley wrote, \"So is this ascent from jaw-dropping badness to mere mediocrity a step upward? Well, until last weekend ... I would have recommended \"Spider-Man\" only to carrion-feasting theater vultures. Now, if I knew a less-than-precocious child of 10 or so, and had several hundred dollars to throw away, I would consider taking him or her to the new and improved \"Spider-Man\".\"\n\nIn the show's first incarnation, the average rating from critics was \"F+\", while the revision garnered an average score of \"C+\". In a roundup of the reviews, Linda Buchwald commented, \"critics actually miss some of Julie Taymor's ambition, crazy as they may have thought it at the time. Critics agree that the show is improved in that it makes much more sense, however, now they mostly find it a bore. Bono and the Edge's score is almost universally panned while Patrick Page's Green Goblin and stunning visuals remain for most critics the best reasons to see the show.\"\n\nTheatre review aggregator \"Curtain Critic\" gave the production a score of 50 out of 100 based on the opinions of 20 critics.\n\nDespite poor reviews and bad publicity, \"Spider-Man\" was at times successful at the box office. Ticket sales the day after the first preview on November 28, 2010, were more than one million dollars. During the first full week of 2011, \"Spider-Man\" had the highest box-office gross on Broadway, with a total of $1,588,514.\n\n\"The New York Times\"' Patrick Healy stated in February 2011 that \"Spider-Man\" had become \"a national object of pop culture fascination—more so, perhaps, than any show in Broadway history\" due to media coverage and late-night comedians' monologues on the musical's many delays, injuries, and creative issues. He speculated that the musical would not have staying power through repeat viewings like other hit musicals, after \"tourists and parents with children\" watched it for \"bragging rights at dinner parties or on the playground\". The \"New York Post\" columnist Michael Riedel opined that month that the musical would be short-lived: \"Depending on how much more money its backers are willing to lose, my hunch is that 'Spider-Man' will stagger through the spring, pick up with the tourist traffic in the summer and then collapse in the fall. It should be gone by September [2011].\"\n\n\"Spider-Man\" survived beyond September 2011, with ticket sales improving during the summer. About half of its audience came from beyond the New York metropolitan area, including many foreign tourists. In November, its producers stated that the show earned about $100,000 to $300,000 in net income each week, which means that \"Spider-Man\" would have had to continue playing for at least five years to recoup the $75 million cost. Producers discussed adding new scenes and perhaps a new song each year to persuade fans to attend it again as \"a whole new [comic book] issue\".\n\nThe first week of January 2012, the Broadway League reported that the show had taken in $2,941,790 in ticket sales the week before, the highest single-week gross of any show in the history of Broadway. The record was previously held by \"Wicked\", which took $2.2 million in a week the previous year. Sales declined to $621,960, however, by the last week of September 2013.\n\nDuring the 2010 Tony Awards, host Sean Hayes ran on stage dressed as Spider-Man, struggling comically to sing through the mask. After the first preview performance, Conan O'Brien featured his own \"preview\" of the show, demonstrating how the show could have been more inexpensively produced, in ways that included using Silly String for web-slinging stunts. The cover of the January 17, 2011 \"The New Yorker\" featured a cartoon showing multiple actors dressed as Spider-Man wearing casts or a head brace or in rehab, parodying the cast injuries in the show.\n\nThe musical has been parodied several times on \"Saturday Night Live\". On the December 4, 2010 episode, Andy Samberg played an understudy playing Spider-Man due to injuries, hanging upside-down from the ceiling and failing to flip over, saying, \"You'll flip for it!\" The February 12, 2011 episode had a commercial parody for a law firm called Gublin and Green specializing in lawsuits related to \"Turn Off the Dark\", with a lawyer portrayed by Fred Armisen. While none of the plaintiffs receive cash, they do receive free tickets to a future showing of the musical. One of the testimonials in the advertisement comes from Bono, as played by Andy Samberg. In the March 12, 2011 episode, Taymor, who had just left the production, was satirized by Kristen Wiig.\n\nThe 18th episode of the sixth season of the satirical stop-motion series \"Robot Chicken\", released February 3, 2013, features a sketch where, after the failure of \"Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark\", a second attempt is made to make a Marvel superhero musical, titled \"Avengers: Musictacular Tapstravaganza\", featuring musical numbers sung by Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Loki, and Iron Man, a dance number by Captain America, and a large animatronic Hulk. The musical plays out decently at best until the animatronic Hulk begins to spark and malfunction, causing an explosion that decapitates the actor playing Thor, impales the actor playing Iron Man with a pipe, and severely injures the rest of the cast. Considering the fact that the actors have no insurance, the musical's director and producer light two Molotov cocktails and toss them, burning the theatre as they make a beeline for the exit.\nThe May 23, 2011 episode of the satirical animated series \"Mad\" involved Taymor approaching the \"Smallville\" TV-series version of Clark Kent to cast him and the rest of the characters in \"Smallville: Turn Off The Clark\". At the 2011 Tony Awards, host Neil Patrick Harris tried but failed to confine himself to as many jokes about \"Spider-Man\" as he could complete in 30 seconds, focusing mainly on the accidents plaguing the show.\n\nIn June 2011, \"Sesame Street\" released an online clip parodying the \"Spider-Man\" musical. In the clip, Mr. Johnson is the sole audience member at a performance of \"SpiderMonster, The Musical\". The title character (portrayed by Grover), instead of flying, repeatedly falls onto Mr. Johnson. He explains, \"It is only our 17th opening night, sir. We still have a few kinks to work out.\"\n\nThe of \"\" concerned a high-flying Broadway musical named \"Icarus\", where events similar to the events in the production history of \"Spider-Man\" turn tragic, leading to an actor's death. In \"Icarus\", the creative team includes a high-strung director and a secretly bisexual rock-star composer.\n\nIn \"Broadway Bro Down\", episode of \"South Park\", Randy Marsh discovers that men take women to see Broadway musicals because doing so arouses the women into later performing oral sex on them. When Randy later learns that a boy has taken his teenage daughter to a Broadway show, Randy sneaks into the theater in a Spider-Man costume, and swings onstage, crashing into many actors and audience members, and damaging a water main. Randy's attempt was to stop Broadway shows and he figured he needed to find a way to destroy them.\n\nThe \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" episode \"I Am Spider-Man\", which first aired September 23, 2012, features a Spider-Man musical, with Flash Thompson playing the web slinger.\n\nIn \"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3\", if Deadpool is fighting Spider-Man, Deadpool says that he will \"rough [Spider-Man] up like a Broadway musical!\" If victorious, he tells Spider-Man that \"maybe it would have helped if [he] turned off the dark!\"\n\n\"Simpsons Super Spectacular\" issue #14 features a parody musical featuring Bart Simpson's favorite superhero Radioactive Man. The story chronicles the many disasters that befall attempts to produce a musical featuring the hero titled \"Turn up the Silence\".\n\nAlso, at the end of \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Treehouse of Horror XXII\", a hospital is filled with injured cast members.\n\nIn an episode of \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\", Kimmy's friend and roommate, Titus, auditions for the role of \"Spider-Man #12\" in the Broadway play \"Spider-Man 2: Too Many Spider-Men\" after a stage accident results in half the cast being injured.\n\nIn a season six episode of \"Veep\", Jonah Ryan agrees to help Dan Egan in return for tickets for to \"a certain broadway musical whose tickets are impossible to get, Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark\", to which Egan informs him \"that show closed years ago\".\n\n\"The Simpsons\" episode Springfield Splendor, which aired October 1, 2017, uses the song NY Debut when a producer adapts Lisa and Marge's graphic novel \"Sad Girl\" into a theatrical show that turns disastrous — a physical bit that parodies the rash of injuries when \"Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark\" made its way to Broadway.\n\nA Broadway concept album, produced by Steve Lillywhite, was released on June 14, 2011. On May 25, 2011, a single version of \"Rise Above\", titled \"Rise Above 1: Reeve Carney Featuring Bono and The Edge\", was released digitally.\nThe music video was released on July 28, 2011 and for the \"Billboard\" chart week of August 13, 2011 the single debuted on the Adult Top 40 chart at position 40, and peaked at position 34.\n\nJon Dolan for \"Rolling Stone\" gave the album a three stars rating out of five commenting: \"Amid the all many disasters that beset the Broadway version of Spider-Man, Bono and the Edge's songs emerge pretty much unscathed by critics. Now that the show has been revised and restaged, this centerpiece anthem of struggle over adversity may become a metaphor for its slog towards redemption. \"Rise Above\" is a trademark soaring U2 ballad, with the elegant grandeur cranked up to Andrew Lloyd Webber levels. But show tunes need big voices too, and, singing next to Bono on this version from the forthcoming cast recording album, leading man Reeve Carney sounds like a nervous understudy.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of \"Allmusic\" gave the album one star, stating that all the problems that plagued the production \"obscured one key problem with the musical: the songs written by Bono and The Edge are dreadful.\" Erlewine summed up his review calling the songs a \"murky, turgid mess, too concerned with atmosphere and narrative to reel in a listener and ironically not offering ambience or story enough to suggest that the musical would entertain.\"\n\nThe concept album features alternate orchestrations and arrangements not featured in the Broadway productions and omits a number of songs including \"The Myth of Arachne,\" \"Behold and Wonder,\" \"Bullying By Numbers,\" \"Venom,\" \"Spider-Man!\" \"I'll Take Manhattan\" and the finale \"A New Dawn.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "28543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28543", "title": "Spoonerism", "text": "Spoonerism\n\nA spoonerism is an error in speech in which corresponding consonants, vowels, or morphemes are switched (see Metathesis) between two words in a phrase. These are named after the Oxford don and ordained minister William Archibald Spooner, who was famous for doing this.\n\nAn example is saying \"The Lord is a shoving leopard\" instead of \"The Lord is a loving shepherd.\" While spoonerisms are commonly heard as slips of the tongue, and getting one's words in a tangle, they can also be used intentionally as a play on words.\n\nIt is named after the Reverend William Archibald Spooner (1844–1930), Warden of New College, Oxford, who was notoriously prone to this mistake. The term \"Spoonerism\" was well established by 1921. An article in \"The Times\" from that year reports that,\nThe boys of Aldro School, Eastbourne, ... have been set the following task for the holidays: Discover and write down something about: The Old Lady of Threadneedle-street, a Spoonerism, a Busman's Holiday...\nIn 1937, The Times quoted a detective describing a man as \"a bricklabourer's layer\" and used \"Police Court Spoonerism\" as the headline.\nA spoonerism is also known as a \"marrowsky,\" purportedly after a Polish count who suffered from the same impediment.\n\nMost of the quotations attributed to Spooner are apocryphal; \"The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations\" (3rd edition, 1979) lists only one substantiated spoonerism: \"The weight of rages will press hard upon the employer\" (instead of \"rate of wages\"). Spooner himself claimed that \"The Kinquering Congs Their Titles Take\" (in reference to a hymn) was his sole spoonerism. Most spoonerisms were probably never uttered by William Spooner himself but rather made up by colleagues and students as a pastime. Richard Lederer, calling \"Kinkering Kongs their Titles Take\" (with an alternative spelling) one of the \"few\" authenticated Spoonerisms, dates it to 1879, and he gives nine examples \"attributed to Spooner, most of them spuriously.\" They are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA newspaper column attributes this additional example to Spooner: \"A nosey little cook.\" (as opposed to a \"cosy little nook\").\n\nIn modern terms, \"spoonerism\" generally refers to any changing of sounds in this manner.\n\nShel Silverstein's book \"Runny Babbit\" is almost completely written in spoonerisms, from character names to anything else.\n\nIn his poem \"Translation,\" Brian P. Cleary describes a boy named Alex who speaks in spoonerisms (like \"shook a tower\" instead of \"took a shower\"). Humorously, Cleary leaves the poem's final spoonerism up to the reader when he says,\n\nHe once proclaimed, \"Hey, belly jeans\"\nWhen he found a stash of jelly beans.\nBut when he says he pepped in stew\nWe'll tell him he should wipe his shoe.\nIn Samuil Marshak's poem \"What an Absent-Minded Guy\" (Вот какой рассеянный), the titular character uses spoonerisms at one point (\"Глубокоуважаемый Вагоноуважатый! Вагоноуважаемый Глубокоуважатый!\"). The character is based on the Russian scientist , who was prone to spoonerisms himself.\n\nComedian F. Chase Taylor was the star of the 1930s radio program \"Stoopnagle and Budd\", in which his character, Colonel Stoopnagle, used spoonerisms. In 1945, he published a book, \"My Tale Is Twisted\", consisting of 44 \"spoonerised\" versions of well-known children's stories. Subtitled \"Wart Pun: Aysop's Feebles\" and \"Tart Pooh: Tairy and Other Fales,\" these included such tales as \"Beeping Sleauty\" for \"Sleeping Beauty.\" The book was republished in 2001 by Stone and Scott Publishers as \"Stoopnagle's Tale is Twisted\".\n\n\n\n\nAs complements to \"spoonerism\", Douglas Hofstadter used the nonce words \"kniferism\" and \"forkerism\" to refer to changing, respectively, the vowels or the final consonants of two syllables, giving them a new meaning. Examples of so-called kniferisms include a British television newsreader once referring to the police at a crime scene removing a 'hypodeemic nerdle'; a television announcer once saying that \"All the world was thrilled by the marriage of the Duck and Doochess of Windsor\"; and during a live broadcast in 1931, radio presenter Harry von Zell accidentally mispronouncing US President Herbert Hoover's name as \"Hoobert Heever.\" Usage of these new terms has been limited; many sources count any syllable exchange as a spoonerism, regardless of location.\n\nSir Stafford Cripps was once mistakenly called Sir Stifford Crapps by McDonald Hobley on the BBC.\n\n\n"}

Created by John Hix, \"Strange as It Seems\" was distinguished for its adherence to Hix's standard that every published fact be verified by a minimum of three sources. In Hix's words, \"Strange as It Seems\" is a library of \n\nThe \"Strange as It Seems\" syndicated comic strips were printed daily in newspapers from 1928 to 1970. They were originally created by John Hix. \"Strange as It Seems\" was distinguished for its adherence to Hix's standard that every published fact be verified by a minimum of three sources.\n\nIt was syndicated domestically by McClure Newspaper Syndicate and internationally by United Press International. At its peak the strip was printed in 1,300 newspapers. The cartoons competed in newspapers with \"Ripley's Believe It or Not!\" cartoons. Other similar strips at the time included Ralph Graczak's \"Our Own Oddities\" and \"It Happened in Canada\" by Gordon Johnston.\n\nBy 1953, the strip's syndication was down to 175 newspapers. The demise of multiple newspapers in cities and the changing taste of readers led to the strip ending in 1970.\n\nThe cartoon strip was written and drawn by John Hix from 1928 until his health began to deteriorate in the early 1940s and Dick Kirby began drawing the strip, although Hix continued to oversee and approve all content.\n\nJohn Hix died of myocarditis on June 6, 1944 (which was also D-Day). His brother, Ernest Hix, took over producing the feature. The cartoons were drawn by Dick Kirby from 1944 to 1946, then by Doug Heyes from 1946 to 1948. After Ernest Hix's death in the crash of a private plane on September 18, 1948, in Los Angeles, the writing of the strip was taken over by his wife Elsie Huber Hix. Ms. Hix had two young children at the time, Ernest Harmon Hix Jr. and Dixie Ann Hix. Dick Kirby returned to draw the strip from 1948 until 1949, then George Jahns took over and continued as the feature's artist until 1970 when the strip was discontinued. Ms. Hix continued to write the stories for the comics until 1963, when she turned the work over to her son, Ernest Hix, Jr. He wrote and produced the strip with his wife Phyllis until 1970 when the feature went out of syndication.\n\n\"Strange as It Seems\" was a radio program of strange and unusual tales about fantastic people and events, based on the daily syndicated newspaper cartoon panels of John Hix of the same name. \"Strange as It Seems\" began as a 15-minute radio program on March 22, 1935. It was broadcast over the Columbia – Don Lee Coast radio network. The schedule was 3 nights a week - Sunday, Wednesday and Friday at 7:45 PM (6:45 during summer daylight saving time). The sponsor was Ex‐Lax. In late September 1935 the show changed to two shows per week, dropping the Sunday show. In late September 1936 the schedule changed again to Tuesday and Friday nights. A 1936 booklet of the \"Strange as It Seems\" stories was sponsored by Ex-Lax and given away as a free promotion of the radio program by writing to the station. The show was hosted by Gayne Whitman, produced and directed by Cyril Armbrister and the music was composed and directed by Felix Mills. Whitman had been the announcer on the \"Strange as It Seems\" movie shorts from 1930–1934. The programs included two or three segments of dramatized events in mini plays with dramatic, fanfare music interspersed in the show between segments. After the opening line, an Ex-Lax commercial would follow. Then two or three strange stories would be presented. The show would conclude with a preview of the next show's stories, an Ex-Lax commercial, a strange fact of trivia, such as \"butterflies smell with their feet\" and finally a short musical ending. There were occasionally live interviews with unusual personalities, such as the World's Fastest Talker. Many of the programs were distributed on 16\" 33 RPM records with one 15 minute show on each side. Many sources list at least 39 of these records with a total of 78 programs recorded. This run of the shows concluded at the end of January 1937, after over 210 shows. The show began again in January 1938 as a 15-minute once a week program, airing on Sunday afternoons at 3:00 (2:00 during daylight saving time). The show ended at the end of December 1938, with 53 shows in this run.\n\nThe \"Strange as It Seems\" radio program was picked up as a 30-minute network program on the Columbia Broadcasting System from August 17, 1939 to December 26, 1940 on Thursdays at 8:30 P.M. (7:30 P.M. during the summer daylight saving time). There were 72 broadcasts of these 1⁄2 hour broadcasts. The sponsor was Palmolive Shave Cream and the host was Alois Havrilla. Havrilla was the announcer on the \"Stranger Than Fiction\" movie shorts beginning in 1934 and continuing in that role until the shorts were ended in 1942. \"Stranger Than Fiction\" was the successor to the \"Strange as It Seems\" movie shorts that ran from 1930 until 1934.\n\nThe program had one final run in its original 15 minute format from Nov. 10, 1946 to April 13, 1947, airing at 7:30 PM on Sunday nights. There were 22 episodes aired in this run. In the newspaper story about the death of John Hix on June 6, 1944, Ernest Hix stated there were over 600 radio programs produced, indicating there were other shows than those so far identified.\n\nAlfred Vosburgh was born March 19, 1890 in Chicago, Illinois. He first used the stage name of Alfred Whitman when he began acting in silent films in 1917. He later used the stage name Gayne Whitman, beginning in 1925. He was an American radio and film actor. On radio, he played the title role in Chandu the Magician and was an announcer on other programs. He appeared in 213 films between 1904 and 1957. His wife was the former Estelle Allen. Whitman died on August 31, 1958 in Los Angeles, CA of a heart attack.\n\nGordon 'Felix' Mills was born on July 28, 1901 in Fort Collins, Colorado. He was a highly successful composer-arranger-conductor during the Golden Age of Radio in the 1930s and 1940s. He was the musical director for \"The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air\", a Disney radio show of the 1930s. Mills created a \"gadget band\" with wild instruments for Donald Duck to direct on some episodes.\n\nHe was also the musical director for CBS Radio's \"Silver Theater\" from 1937 to 1947. Choosing to retire rather than fire a few band members during the Red Inquisition, he built a home in Morro Bay, California to pursue his favorite hobbies, sailing and slide photography. Mills died on April 5, 1987 at Morro Bay, California.\n\nCyril Edward Armbrister was born on Cat Island, Bahamas on August 24, 1896. His ancestors had been British loyalists during the Revolutionary War and immigrated to the Bahamas in the late 1700s. His father, William Armbrister, married for a second time at the age of 76 to Eugenie Bode and Cyril was born of this marriage. His father died when Cyril was 12 and he and his mother moved to Canada. Cyril was educated in England and was a captain in the Canadian Militia during World War I. He later moved to Hollywood and became a director. He directed \"Chandu the Magician\", \"Terry and the Pirates\", and \"Land of the Lost\", among other radio programs. He married the actress Frances Fintel and they split their time between California and the family plantation on Cat Island, Bahamas. Cyril's son Tony developed the family plantation into the resort, Fernandez Bay. Cyril died on September 18, 1966 in Nassau, Bahamas.\n\nAlois Havrilla was born June 7, 1891 in Presov, Slovakia. He arrived in the United States as a small child, speaking no English. He worked hard to perfect his English. He began his radio career as a baritone singer. In 1921, he recorded, \"Tancuj, Tancuj,\" a well-known Slovak folk song. He then worked as an announcer on the \"Palmolive Hour\" on NBC from 1927 to 1931. He also worked as an announcer on several other radio programs, including \"The Jack Benny Program\" in 1934–1935 and the Paul Whiteman radio program. In 1935, he received an award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the prestigious Medal for Good Diction and was named as the country's best radio announcer. He also worked as a narrator for Universal, Paramount Pictorial and Pathe Motion Picture Studios. Havrilla worked at a number of New York-area radio stations as a news commentator, announcer, narrator, and host of musical programs. He died on December 7, 1952 in Englewood, New Jersey.\n\nWarner Brothers released a series of short films beginning in May 1930 based on Robert Ripley's \"Ripley's Believe it or Not!\" cartoon series. Universal Studios responded by signing John Hix to a contract to create short films based on his cartoon strip \"Strange as It Seems\". There were 39 short subjects released between August 22, 1930 and May 5, 1934, coming out on average about once per month. The films were produced by Jerry Fairbanks & Manny Nathan, scripted by John Hix and narrated by Gayne Whitman. The first 21 released in 1930 were produced in Multicolor. Beginning in September, 1932, the remaining 17 shorts were filmed in Black & White. The shorts played in over 6,000 movie theaters. When Jerry Fairbanks left Universal for rival Paramount, (starting their \"Popular Science (film)\" films, his \"Strange as It Seems\" series was taken over by the Universal Studios newsreel staff with Thomas Mead and Joseph O'Brien in charge and renamed \"Stranger Than Fiction\". The first of these films was released on June 28, 1934 and came out about every 2 to 3 weeks. They were also filmed in black and white and were directed by Charles E. Ford and narrated by Alois Havrilla & James Wallington. Beginning on Sept. 18, 1940, the films were directed by Henry Clay Bate and narrated by Alois Havrilla. The last of the \"Stranger Than Fiction\" short films was released on August 31, 1942, for a total of 110 \"Stranger Than Fiction\" short films and a total of 149 short films, including the \"Stranger than Fiction\" series. Columbia Studios brought back the \"Strange as It Seems\" shorts in 1937. CBS bundled 8 of these shorts in a package to their television affiliates in 1949.\n\nThe first \"Strange as It Seems\" book was published in 1931 and reprinted many of the cartoons from the three-year run of the newspaper feature. In December 1936, Eastern Color Printing published the \"John Hix Scrapbook\". In 1937, Eastern released a second volume.\n\nThere was also a hardback written by Elsie Huber Hix in 1945 and a follow-up paperback. Each sold over 500,000 copies. She published two more paperbacks, with the final one published in 1962.\n\nComic books were a natural medium for these cartoons. The first of these comic books appeared in 1932. Promotional comic books were created for Ex-Lax (as a promotional giveaway on the radio program they sponsored) and United Airlines (as a handout for passengers to read on the flights). A series of comics began in 1939, with issues 2 – 9 being published.\n\nThe California Pacific International Exposition in San Diego opened in May 1935. But by that fall, the promoters knew they needed to make changes. Areas like Gold Gulch (a replica of an 1849 Gold Rush town) and the Zoro Garden Nudist Colony were getting out of hand and generating bad publicity while the \"Ripley's Believe It Or Not!\" exhibit was deemed to be too gruesome, so the exhibitors contacted Ernest and John Hix about opening their own exhibit to replace Ripley's in the 1936 season of the fair. Their exhibit opened in February 1936 and was very popular. John Hix drew from his large collection of oddities for the Exhibition in the large building in the center of the Fun Zone. Then in 1939, the Hix brothers aced out Robert Ripley for an exhibition at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Ripley responded with his own exhibition near the Fair and named it \"Ripley's Believe It Or Not Odditorrium\". A series of the Odditoriums would eventually be created around the world. A 1938 newspaper article described the groundbreaking of the exhibit at the World's Fair \"61 Year old Shovel. Auspiciously performing groundbreaking ceremonies for the John Hix \"Strange as It Seems\" show at the New York World's Fairground on December 30, 1938, Grover Whalen, President of the Fair, used a shovel invented 61 years before – on April 16, 1878 – by G. B. DeForest, embodying construction principles still in use. Betty Broadbent was one of the persons at the Hix's attraction. Her body was covered almost entirely with over 450 tattoos.\n\nThe \"Strange as It Seems\" archives are maintained by Jeff Hix, grandnephew of John Hix and the son of Ernest Harmon Hix, Jr. and are currently being digitized by HistoriVision, LLC. to be made available to the public for reference as well as for use in the \"Strange as It Seems\" productions currently published on their website and YouTube channel. According to the \"Strange as It Seems\" website, the archives are a \"40 year treasure trove of fascinating letters and photos from the world over confirming the strange and unusual stories in sports, science, popular culture, history and nature delivered daily to its faithful readership throughout the 1930's, 40's, 50's & 60's.\"\n\nRobert Ripley of \"Ripley's Believe It Or Not!\" and John Hix of \"Strange as It Seems\" competed on many media fronts in acquiring and accumulating the most original and strange facts for their projects. There was always a friendly rivalry between Ripley and Hix in their various media offerings: \n\nThey also competed in book and comic book publishing as well.\n\nJohn McCary Hix was born on June 17, 1907 in Huntsville, Alabama, to John Harmon Hix and Viola Ann McCary Hix. His brother Ernest Harmon Hix was born on September 13, 1902. Before World War I, the family first located to Nashville, Tennessee, then Spartanburg, South Carolina. John Harmon Hix was a traveling salesman and moved his family to Greenville, South Carolina, where their third child, a daughter, Elizabeth Jane, was born in August 1918.\n\nAt an early age, John McCary Hix had a strong urge to draw. He drew unflattering caricatures of his teachers which often got him into trouble. Eventually his cartooning paid off and his drawings appeared in the \"Nautilus\", the Greenville High School newspaper. While in school, John took a job with the \"Greenville Daily News\" as a staff artist for $5 a week.\nHe was also a delivery boy on his bicycle, which earned him $7 a week. His dog Pal, a shaggy black and white half-collie and half-Water spaniel, followed him everywhere on his deliveries. John trained Pal to drop papers on the doorsteps of one side of street while he delivered the other. He got up every morning at 3:00 AM and was at the newspaper office by 4:00 AM. He was also the local agent for several magazines, selling them as well. \n\nHe studied cartooning through a correspondence course, since there were no art schools nearby. When his father died on March 5, 1926 of heart failure, John was in his senior year of school. After graduation from Greenville High School in May 1926 (he has a plaque on the Greenville High School Wall of Fame), John decided he wanted bigger things and applied to the \"Washington Herald\" newspaper as an editorial cartoonist. He got the job and moved to Washington, D.C., where he was paid $15 a week. While in Washington D.C., he attended a few classes at the Corcoran School of Art. \n\nHe also started a daily one-column comic strip called \"Hicks by Hix\", featuring various wise-cracking hick characters. It was syndicated by King Features Syndicate. The strip did very well and was syndicated to several newspapers. This success lead to a job with McClure Newspapers in New York City. He illustrated a new strip called \"Young Frank Merriwell\", written by Gilbert Patten. It debuted on March 26, 1928 and ran for 6 months (the comic strip was resurrected in July 1931 as \"Frank Merriwell's Schooldays\" and ran for three years, this time illustrated by Jack Wilhelm). He also created a strip called \"O. Henry's Short Stories\". During this time he attended a few classes at the National Academy of Design in New York. His dream was to attend the Yale School of Art where several of his art school classmates were attending, but there was not the money for that so most of John's art training was learned on the job.\n\n\"Ripley's Believe it or Not!\", drawn by Robert Ripley began syndication in 1918. It contained many fantastic claims, which were not always verified. In 1927, John conceived the idea of \"Strange as It Seems\" and in December of that year, he signed a contract with The McClure Newspaper Syndicate in New York City, making him the nation's youngest nationally syndicated artist at only 20 years old. The cartoon was announced for syndication by McClure in February 1928 and debuted on March 28, 1928 in about 50 newspapers, the same day \"Young Frank Merriwell\" debuted. The cartoon was one panel with several illustrations of strange and unusual people, places and events. The feature required much more than just drawing as countless hours of research were required for the ideas and to verify their authenticity. Hix advertised widely that all of his claims were verified by at least three sources. He even included a notation on his cartoons, \"If you doubt this, write for proof to the author.\" In the May 20, 1929 issue of \"Time\" magazine, it was erroneously reported that the comic had debuted the previous week. A letter to the editor three weeks later from Harold Matson, Managing Editor of the syndicate, corrected the timing of the cartoons publication dates. \"Time\" compared Hix to Ripley with this observation: \"Cartoonist Hix does not seem quite so able with his pencil as Cartoonist Ripley. Astounder Ripley, after nine years, does not seem quite so astounding as fresh Astounder Hix.\"\n\nIn the January 4, 1930 edition of \"Editor & Publisher\" magazine, Hix announced that in early February 1930, \"Strange as It Seems\" would be expanded to include a full page Sunday color edition. The comic was being carried in over 80 newspapers by this time. John was now drawing a daily panel plus a Sunday color panel, a full 365 cartoons a year. As the cartoon grew in popularity and distribution spread into more papers, fans began mailing John ideas for the feature. To verify the story ideas, John would correspond with educators, scientists, civic workers and historians from around the world for photographs and documentation of authenticity. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that Hix rarely traveled for his ideas, but relied on correspondence for verification and had built a repository of 50,000–60,000 usable ideas ready to be incorporated into his cartoons. The claim that drew the most requests for proof of authenticity was that George Washington was the eighth president of the United States and that he was born on February 11, not February 22. The cartoons were often accompanied by several paragraphs of explanation in an article next to the cartoon.\n\nJohn Hix continued to live in Washington D.C. and is listed in the 1930 U.S. Census as living on New Hampshire Avenue, a couple of houses down from the rest of his family.\n\"Strange as It Seems\" became immensely popular and there were many opportunities for expanding the feature. John's brother Ernest Hix became his business manager and together they recognized the possibilities of turning the \"Strange as It Seems\" cartoons into a multi-media empire, especially after Ripley's \"Believe It Or Not!\" cartoons were transformed into live action movie shorts for Paramount Studios beginning in May 1930. \n\nUniversal Studios offered John Hix an opportunity to create movie shorts for their studio and the first \"Strange as It Seems\" short was released on August 22, 1930. The shorts would eventually play in over 6,000 movie theaters across the country. Like the Disney brothers a decade before them, the Hix brothers relocated their feature to Hollywood, California, in 1931. In 1931, a hardback book of the cartoon stories was released. The first of many comic books with the cartoons in them appeared in 1932. In May 1932, the cartoon was in over 150 newspapers. By November 1932, the cartoons were appearing in England, China and Japan.\n\nIn the spring of 1935, John Hix turned his cartoons into a successful 15-minute radio program on the Columbia – Don Lee network. Beginning on Sept. 13, 1936, \"The John Hix Scrapbook\" was released as half of the syndicated Sunday Color full page cartoon. In September 1939, the radio show became a 30-minute program broadcast weekly over the CBS network for 72 weeks. Over 600 radio programs were eventually created. The California Pacific International Exposition in San Diego opened in May 1935 with an exhibit of \"Ripley's Believe It Or Not!\". But by the end of that year, exhibit was deemed to be too gruesome. So the exhibitors contacted Ernest and John Hix about opening their own exhibit to replace Ripley's in the 1936 season of the fair. Their exhibit opened in February 1936 and was immensely popular. In 1939, the Hix brothers outmaneuvered Ripley for an exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair. \n\nIn its heyday, it was reported that the \"Strange as It Seems\" comic strip was syndicated in over 1,300 newspapers. John Hix enjoyed people questioning the authenticity of his stories and continued to invite them to write for proof in each cartoon, a feature that became the centerpiece for many of his promotional newspaper articles. During World War II, John worked with the Office of Emergency Management to incorporate 70 ideas they supplied into his comics to help the war effort.\n\nJohn's health began failing in the early 1940s and Dick Kirby took over the drawing of \"Strange as It Seems\", but Hix still reviewed all of the cartoons prior to publication.\n\nOn Monday evening, June 5, 1944, John Hix collapsed against a car, gashing his head in front of a hotel on Ivar Ave. He was taken to his home by his physician and died the following morning, June 6, 1944 (D-Day). The cause of death was a heart attack caused by myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle due to a viral infection). He was only 11 days shy of his 37th birthday. On June 8, 1944, the \"Los Angeles Times\" announced that there would be a private service coordinated by Forest Lawn Mortuary. John was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, CA. His plot is in The Great Mausoleum, Memorial Terrace, Hall of Memory, Columbarium of Memory, Niche 19608. He had no wife or children.\n\nErnest Harmon Hix, Sr. was born September 13, 1902 in Huntsville, Alabama. After he moved to Washington D.C. with his family in the 1920s, he met and married Elsie Huber in 1932. Ernest became the business manager of the \"Strange as It Seems\" business and helped to create a multi-media empire of cartoons, movies shorts, books, comics, radio programs and exhibitions. He relocated with his brother, mother, sister and wife to Los Angeles in the 1930s. In 1942, he shared an office with his brother, John, at 6362 Haywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA and his residence was on Canyon Drive, Los Angeles, CA. Ernest took over the \"Strange as It Seems\" creative business after John Hix died suddenly in 1944. Besides continuing to write the daily syndicated cartoon, Ernest revived the radio show, as a transcribed 15 minute program in 1947. The program ran until his death on September 18, 1948 in a private plane crash, shortly after take-off from the Newhall Airport north of Los Angeles.\n\nThe plane's owner, Eugene Joseff, had been warned not to take off until a fog lifted, but he took off anyway. The plane crashed and burst into flames after circling the field. Beside Ernest Hix and Eugene Joseff, there were two other persons killed in the plane crash: John M. Lacey, the pilot and Wilmer F. Pemberton, a designer.\nJoseff was the maker and supplier of about 90% of the ornate jewelry used in motion pictures at the time. After his death, Hix's wife Elsie took over the \"Strange as It Seems\" work.\n\nElsie Elizabeth Huber was born Nov. 11, 1902 in Allentown, PA. Her parents were John and Anna Lowe Huber, both born in Germany. They immigrated separately to the United States in their twenties and were married in Pennsylvania in 1894. Elsie Huber graduated from Cedar Crest College in 1928. From 1928 to 1930, she taught secretarial courses at Virginia Intermont College in Bristol, VA. In 1930, she became the Office Business Manager of Remington Rand Co. in Washington, D.C. She held this position until her marriage in 1932 to Ernest Harmon Hix, Sr. After the family moved to Los Angeles in the 1930s, from 1939 until 1964, she was the Executive Secretary to George E. Kinsey, a Los Angeles real estate investor, philanthropist and former president of the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission. After the death of her husband in 1948 in a private plane crash, she took over the work of \"Strange as It Seems\". She was the writer of the comic strip for 15 years until 1963, when she turned it over to her son, Ernest Harmon Hix, Jr. In 1964, she married Donald Lee Chamberlin. They were married until his death in 1976. From 1985 she lived in Glendora, CA. She died on December 9, 1995 in Glendale, CA and is buried in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park cemetery in Glendale.\n\nErnest Harmon Hix, Jr. is the son of Ernest Harmon Hix Sr. and Elsie Elizabeth Huber Hix. He wrote and produced the \"Strange as It Seems\" comic strip with his wife Phyllis from 1963 until the feature ceased production in 1970.\n\nJeffrey David Hix is the son of Ernest Harmon Hix Jr. and Phyllis Hix and is curator of the \"Strange as It Seems\" archives. Hix is reviving the \"Strange as It Seems\" brand for the digital age.\n\n"}
{"id": "3845525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3845525", "title": "Syndication exclusivity", "text": "Syndication exclusivity\n\nSyndication exclusivity (also known as syndex) is a federal law implemented by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States that is designed to protect a local television station's rights to syndicated television programs by granting exclusive broadcast rights to the station for that program in their local market, usually defined by a station's Nielsen Designated Market Area.\n\nAs a result, any airings of the same program on cable networks and, more commonly, superstations must be blocked by the local cable provider upon request from the local station. Broadcast television stations have the option of signing programming deals with or without syndex protection, but they stand to have audiences significantly diluted in markets without protection. Syndex protection is rarely enforced in regards to conventional cable networks, which (particularly since the late 1990s) often concurrently maintain rights to a particular program during the period of a broadcast syndication deal.\n\nThe first syndex rule to be passed by the Federal Communications Commission went into effect on March 31, 1972. The regulations at the time were similar to those in the present-day law, except for the fact that they applied to almost all programming, including shows such as the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. WTCG in Atlanta, the original \"superstation\" (which at the time was distributed only in the Southeastern United States, five years before it became available nationally via satellite transmission), had programming blacked out in some areas where duplication existed.\n\nIn November 1976, the FCC began to consider making alterations to the syndex rulings. In April 1979, the FCC made a proposal to remove some of the rules. Further debate led the Cable Television Bureau of the FCC to recommend doing away with the rules entirely. On July 22, 1980, the Commission revoked the syndex rulings in a 4–3 vote, on the basis that \"local stations are not adversely affected when a cable system offers subscribers signals from television stations in other cities.\" In 1980, the FCC lifted the old syndex law, as a way to bolster the growing cable television industry. This led cable systems to begin carrying other superstations and more regional out-of-market independent stations, at a time when the popularity of both was growing.\n\nThe current syndex law was tied in part to the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988. In the run-up to that legislation's passage on May 18, 1988, Tom Meek (general manager of WOFL in Orlando, Florida), with the assistance of Preston Padden of the Association of Independent Television Stations (INTV), presented a study utilizing custom Nielsen audience data showing significant ratings dilution in the 7:00–8:00 p.m. period that was directly attributable to the carriage of identical programming via Chicago superstation WGN-TV on numerous local cable providers, resulting in an estimated loss in advertising revenue of several hundred thousand dollars. The legislation, H.R. 2848, had been blocked by Democratic representative Mike Synar, whose district included Tulsa, Oklahoma, where WGN's satellite carrier United Video Satellite Group was headquartered. After the study was presented to and subsequently validated by Synar's staff, Synar dropped his opposition under pressure from committee chairman Washington Democratic Rep. Al Swift. H.R. 2848, sponsored by Texas Democratic Rep. John Bryant, then passed.\n\nThe syndex rules went back into effect on January 1, 1990. Before the reimposition of the syndex rules, stations like WGN and WTBS were paying local single market rates for programming acquisitions, even as they were gaining national coverage, and were selling that extended coverage to advertisers. After the syndex law was implemented, in at least some cases, the prices that superstations paid for program content had better reflected their actual national distribution, depending on arrangements with any given syndicator.\n\nSyndex is currently being used to block superstations offered through a programming tier provided by satellite provider Dish Network from being picked up in certain markets. In this case, the CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates in given markets can invoke the syndex law to keep the superstations that have the same network affiliations as the local station from coming into the market in any form. CW stations are using the law in order to block KTLA in Los Angeles, WPIX/New York City and KWGN-TV/Denver, while WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey and WSBK-TV/Boston are presently blocked in markets where MyNetworkTV affiliates are invoking the law.\n\nThere have been a number of legal cases, most notably in Miami, and efforts in Washington, D.C. by terrestrial broadcasters to keep satellite providers from exploiting a provision in the law whereby satellite providers can offer programming where a broadcast station's signal is not available. In the Miami case, satellite providers were found to have allowed carriage of outside stations in households within a few miles of broadcast transmitters in violation of the law. Syndex is often unpopular with satellite subscribers and companies who would rather not afford local broadcast stations program rights protection.\n\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, several independent local stations were uplinked via satellite so that they could be available either nationally or regionally, especially to markets that did not have independent stations, either because the market could not support one due to having lower population densities or because one simply did not exist. Three of those stations, WOR-TV/WWOR-TV in New York City (later moved to Secaucus, New Jersey), WGN-TV in Chicago and WTBS in Atlanta, were available nationally. WTBS aired shows that were generally \"syndex proof\" (or, in simpler terms, having \"full signal rights\") due to program contracts that the station was able to negotiate so that it could avoid having any programs blacked out or substituted, save for sports programs.\n\nIn 1990, when the syndex law was passed, national versions of WWOR-TV and WGN-TV, which aired different programs from the local signals in their native cities, were launched. These feeds replaced programs that had syndication exclusivity claims in certain markets with syndicated programs to which no station held exclusive rights in any market. WWOR's national feed outside of New York City was branded as the \"WWOR EMI Service\" (the \"EMI\" referring to Eastern Microwave, Inc., the superstation feed's satellite uplinker). WGN-TV did not have to cover up as many programs as WWOR, and while WGN was able to carry programming from The WB network on its national feed from January 1995 (when its Chicago parent station also affiliated with the network) to October 1999, WWOR was not permitted by UPN to carry that network's programming on the EMI feed. This negatively affected UPN as WGN's carriage of The WB temporarily filled holes where that network did not have a full-time or secondary carrier in some markets until the network found local over-the-air affiliates and later set up a cable-only feed in 1998. UPN's decision to deny WWOR permission to carry its programming nationally left open gaps in market coverage for that network in several large and mid-sized cities.\n\nAfter the national version of WWOR ceased uplinking in January 1997 (after Advance Entertainment Corporation sold WWOR's satellite transponder slot to Discovery Communications to expand national coverage of Animal Planet), the New York City-area feed, which included UPN programs and other shows previously covered up on the EMI feed, was uplinked by the National Programming Service for exclusive distribution to satellite providers. That feed was discontinued in 1999 with its transponder space being turned over to Pax TV, though Dish Network now carries the New York City feed of WWOR. WTBS was separated from the national feed of TBS in October 2007, and now airs only Atlanta-cleared programming as WPCH (the Atlanta station remains a superstation in Canada, although some of its programming is instead substituted with a domestic network feed of the same program under simultaneous substitution regulations). WGN's national superstation feed, later branded as \"WGN Superstation\" and \"Superstation WGN\", would be renamed \"WGN America\" in 2007; by this point, the number of syndicated programs that WGN-TV both gained full signal rights to \"and\" aired on both the Chicago broadcast signal and the national feed had substantially decreased, with WGN America mirroring the former WWOR EMI Service in its scheduling. WGN's national feed was also separated from its parent station, except in name, and converted into a basic cable network on December 16, 2014, and as a result no longer carries any Chicago-area programming.\n\nIn any case, national superstations such as WGN were, in later years, still sometimes able to negotiate full signal rights for a syndicated program. Whether or not a particular program could be cleared for full signal rights depends on how it was originally sold to other television stations nationwide. For example, the repackaged \"American Idol Rewind\" was allowed to air on WGN's national \"Superstation\" signal by virtue of Tribune Entertainment (the now-defunct production and distribution unit of the station's owner, the Tribune Company) being a majority partner as well as the distributor of the program.\n\nOther studios can also allow full signal rights to superstations for its programming. For example, 20th Television allowed WGN full signal rights to the syndicated version of \"24\" as did NBCUniversal Television Distribution with \"30 Rock\", and Sony Pictures Television used the same method for \"Seinfeld\" for TBS.\n\nHowever, once one superstation's term of license on a program ends, it can enter into syndex restrictions. For example, for decades TBS had full signal rights to \"The Andy Griffith Show\" until Viacom's cable networks were able to negotiate new full signal rights in the mid-1990s (\"The Andy Griffith Show\" at the time was distributed by Viacom, then its successor, Paramount Television). Today, TV Land has national rights to \"The Andy Griffith Show\" (now distributed through CBS Television Distribution), and under this new contract cannot be seen on any other national network or superstation, but it can still be seen on local over-the-air stations, as stations such as WRAL-TV/WRAZ in Raleigh and WVTV in Milwaukee have done for decades (similarly, the broadcast rights to the program held by some local stations have prevented Me-TV from carrying \"Andy Griffith\" on many of its affiliates since it began carrying the sitcom in 2014). Broadcasts on these local stations are only restricted to their particular markets.\n\n"}

After many years in the same place in Riga, where Kornilov's program once again came on tour, Taisia and Alexey were students of the same school. \n\nThe creative tandem of two young talented people turned out to be ideal: Alexei, in addition to animal training, was engaged in all administrative issues, Taisia, after graduating from the directing department of GITIS, took over the creative side of the program. The artists not only improved the attraction, showing in it a completely new presentation of animal training which met the requirements and style of the time, but also created their own tent-circus, with which they successfully toured in many cities and countries. Their elephants appeared in many famous movies, and the couple themselves in 2000 became the youngest People's Artists of Russia and received the state award of Moscow.\n\nIn 2000, the Kornilov family experienced a tragedy - Aleksei Dementiev died in a car accident.

The sequel to Six's 2009 film \"The Human Centipede (First Sequence)\", the film stars Laurence R. Harvey as a mentally impaired English man who watches and becomes obsessed with the first \"Human Centipede\" film, and decides to make his own \"centipede\" consisting of 12 people, including Ashlynn Yennie, an actress from the first film.\n\nThe film was subject to heavy censorship throughout the world, where it was sometimes edited to remove objectionable content or banned altogether. It received generally negative reviews, with much criticism focused on its acting, plot and violence.\n\nIn the tollbooth of a multistory carpark in east London, Martin Lomax (Laurence R. Harvey) is watching \"The Human Centipede (First Sequence)\" on his laptop, a film he is obsessed with. Overweight, asthmatic, and mentally challenged, Martin lives with his overbearing mother (Vivien Bridson), who blames him for having his father put in prison for physically and sexually abusing Martin when he was a boy. Dr. Sebring (Bill Hutchens), Martin's psychiatrist, also touches him inappropriately and prescribes him heavy medication. Martin keeps a pet centipede, which he gleefully feeds insects to.\n\nMartin acquires a dingy warehouse after killing the lessor and begins abducting people to use for his own human centipede. His victims include: an aggressive young man (Lucas Hansen) and his girlfriend (Emma Lock), two drunk girls (Kandice Caine and Georgia Goodrick) who catch Martin masturbating with sandpaper, a man (Daniel Jude Gennis) and his pregnant wife (this couple has a toddler, whom Martin leaves in the back seat of their car uninjured), and another man. Martin also catches Dr. Sebring and a cabbie (Gabe Kerr) having sex with a prostitute (Maddi Black), and proceeds to kill Sebring before abducting the cabbie and prostitute. When Martin's mother finds and destroys his scrapbook, Martin kills her by bludgeoning her head repeatedly with his crowbar until her skull caves in. He then lures his detested neighbour (Lee Nicholas Harris) to the scene, shoots, and kidnaps him. Martin's final victim is Ashlynn Yennie, the actress who played \"Jenny\" in the first film (now playing herself, having been lured by Martin under the pretense of a film audition with Quentin Tarantino).\n\nWith twelve victims, Martin begins assembling his \"centipede\". He severs the ligaments in each person's knees to prevent them from fleeing and uses a hammer to knock out their teeth. He slices open the buttocks of one of his victims, causing him to bleed to death. In a quick change of plan, instead of actual surgeon tools, he uses a staple gun and duct tape to attach each person's lips to the next person's buttocks. During the assembly process, the pregnant woman is presumed dead; a grieving Martin places her in the corner. His \"human centipede\" is ultimately ten people long with Ashlynn in front.\n\nAfter performing the crude procedure, Martin begins experimenting. Disturbed by Ashlynn's screams, he tears her tongue out with pliers. He then injects each victim with a syringe of laxative, forcing each of them to explosively evacuate their bowels into the mouth of the person behind them. After pausing, he then wraps his genitals in barbed wire and rapes the woman at the end of his \"centipede\". As he finishes, the pregnant woman awakes and runs outside screaming, apparently in labour. She leaps into a victim's car and bears her child. She then gets onto the road, but as she starts the engine, she stomps on the accelerator, crushing the baby's skull under the pedal. She still manages to escape.\n\nThe neighbour rips his face from the person in front of him, separating the \"centipede\" into two halves. Furious that his centipede is ruined, Martin shoots all the victims, and when he runs out of ammunition, uses a knife to slit the throats of the remaining victims. As he advances on Ashlynn, he appears to give pause, and kneels in front of her. She punches him in the genitals, shoves the funnel into his rectum, and drops his pet centipede into it. In agony, Martin stabs her in the neck and staggers out. Ashlynn is seen slightly moving afterwards.\n\nThe scene cuts back to the tollbooth, with Martin watching the credits of \"First Sequence\" on his laptop, with exactly the same reaction as the initial scene. However, the toddler left in the car from the previous kidnappings can be heard crying in the background.\n\nDirector Tom Six stated in 2010 that he was working on a sequel to \"The Human Centipede (First Sequence)\", as well as a possible third film depending upon its success. He said that the plot would follow on from the first film, but with a centipede made from 12 people as opposed to the three victims of the first. The tag-line would be \"100% medically inaccurate\", in contrast to his \"100% medically \"accurate\" claim for the first film. Six stated the sequel would be much more graphic and disturbing, making the first film seem like \"My Little Pony\" compared with part two.\"\n\nSpeculation regarding the plot of \"Full Sequence\" grew after the Weekend of Horrors convention in May 2010, when Ashlynn Yennie and Akihiro Kitamura, who had starred in \"First Sequence\", hinted that their characters might return for the sequel despite their deaths in \"First Sequence\". Additionally, Ashley C. Williams, whose character was left alive at the end of \"First Sequence\", stated in September 2010 that she was shooting a horror film in Britain, which led to speculation from FEARnet that she is reprising her role of Lindsay. In a further interview, Yennie confirmed Six's statement that the sequel would contain \"the blood and shit\" which viewers did not see in the first film.\n\nSix was inspired to make the movie a metafilm after reporters kept asking him if he worried about people committing copycat crimes inspired by the first film. Although he had previously considered the concept for a possible sequel, the questions cemented his idea. \n\nAccording to Six, he intentionally made \"Full Sequence\" very different from \"First Sequence\" for two reasons. First, when he was writing the script of \"First Sequence\", he knew people would want more \"blood and shit\" than is shown. Second, the two parts reflect the different characters: the coloured \"First Sequence\", with a slow-moving camera, fit the story of Dr. Heiter, while Martin Lomax's character required a \"dark and dirty\" film. Six shot \"Full Sequence\" in colour, but \"was always thinking about black and white\" and realized while editing that it was \"much scarier\" that way. It was also Six's idea to have little dialogue in the film's second half, except for moans, screams, and whimpers.\n\nPrincipal photography for \"Full Sequence\" began in London in June 2010 with a largely British cast. A teaser trailer was released on 24 September, in which Six introduced Martin, a man wearing a cardboard box over his head, as the new doctor.\n\nThe film had its United States premiere at Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas, on 22 September 2011. The film's distributor, IFC Films, gave audience members complimentary barf bags at the screening, and stationed an ambulance outside the theater as a gimmick. However, one audience member became so physically ill during the premiere that actual paramedics had to assist her.\n\nThe film began a limited theatrical release in the United States on 7 October 2011. It was released unrated and only had midnight showings. The film was released in an \"unrated director's cut\" on DVD and Blu-ray on 14 February 2012; the film runs a total 91 minutes.\n\nA full-color version of the film was released for the first time in the United States on 27 October 2015, exclusively on \"The Human Centipede: The Complete Sequence\" Blu-ray set.\n\nIn April 2016, a Tennessee high school teacher was suspended after the film was played during class. Tom Six responded by tweeting \"It should be mandatory to watch THC2 in school classes...It deals with a character that is bullied and what to do!\" Six also said that he would be giving the teacher an autographed copy of the film.\n\nIn June 2011, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) refused to classify \"The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)\" for a direct-to-video release, effectively meaning that the film could not legally be supplied in any format in the UK. The BBFC had given the preceding \"First Sequence\" title an 18 certificate. The Board stated that they had considered \"First Sequence\" to be \"undoubtedly tasteless and disgusting\", but deemed it acceptable for release because the \"centipede\" was the product of a \"revolting medical experiment\". By contrast, the BBFC report on \"Full Sequence\" stated that the film's content was too extreme for an 18 certificate and was \"sexually violent, and potentially obscene\". The board members felt that the centipede of \"Full Sequence\" existed purely as \"the object of the protagonist's depraved sexual fantasy\". They criticised the film for making \"little attempt to portray any of the victims in the film as anything other than objects to be brutalised and degraded for the amusement and sexual arousal of the main character and for the pleasure of the viewer,\" and stated their opinion that the film was potentially in breach of the Obscene Publications Act. The BBFC initially suggested that cutting the film would not affect the decision, \"as the unacceptable material featured throughout\".\n\nTom Six responded to the BBFC's decision in a statement released the next day:Thank you BBFC for putting spoilers of my movie on your website and thank you for banning my film in this exceptional way. Apparently I made an horrific horror-film, but shouldn't a good horror film be horrific? My dear people it is a f**cking MOVIE. It is all fictional. Not real. It is all make-belief \"[sic]\". It is art. Give people their own choice to watch it or not. If people can't handle or like my movies they just don't watch them. If people like my movies they have to be able to see it any time, anywhere also in the UK.Eureka Entertainment, the film's UK distributor, issued a statement criticising the ban, echoing Six's sentiments about the revelation of plot details in the BBFC's report, and announcing their intention to appeal to the Video Appeals Committee.\n\nIn October 2011, the BBFC ultimately granted the film an 18 certificate for \"very strong bloody violence and gore, and sexual violence\" after 32 compulsory cuts were made, totalling 2 minutes and 37 seconds. Sir Quentin Thomas, president of the BBFC, stated:When we first examined this work earlier this year we judged that, as submitted, it was unsuitable for classification; and, as we explained to the company, we could not ourselves see how cuts could produce a viable and classifiable work. That remains the view of one of our Vice Presidents, Gerard Lemos, who is therefore abstaining from the Board's collective decision. The company lodged an appeal against our decision to refuse classification. In the course of preparations for that appeal, the company proposed a number of cuts which it was right for us to consider. In response, after further examination, we proposed a more extensive series of cuts. These cuts produce a work which many will find difficult but which I believe can properly be classified at the adult level. The company has now accepted these cuts, withdrawn its appeal and the work has been classified, as cut, at 18.The sales director of Eureka Entertainment supported the decision, stating:We are really pleased that after nearly four months of detailed discussion and debate, we have been able to reach an agreement with the BBFC and to produce a very viable cut of the film which will both excite and challenge its fans. Naturally we have a slight disappointment that we have had to make cuts, but we feel that the storyline has not been compromised and the level of horror has been sustained.\n\nIn May 2011, the uncut film was originally granted an R18+ classification by the Australian Classification Board (ACB). However, this decision was later overruled after Minister for Justice Brendan O'Connor asked for a review of the rating by the Australian Classification Review Board. On 28 November 2011, the film was reviewed and by unanimous decision of a three-person board, refused classification.\n\nSeveral groups and individuals, including FamilyVoice Australia, Collective Shout and Cardinal George Pell, the Archbishop of Sydney, welcomed the decision. Monster Pictures, the Australian distributor of the film, criticised the decision and announced their intention to re-edit and re-submit the film for review.\n\nOn 13 December 2011, the ACB classified a modified version of the film at R18+ for \"high impact themes, violence and sexual violence\". Monster Pictures expressed their \"delight\", and clarified that thirty seconds of the film had been \"modified\". They concluded that \"this decision highlights the absurdity of Classification Review Board's decision to ban the film in the first place.\"\n\nDue to the reaction by Australian film authorities, the film was not submitted for theatrical distribution in New Zealand. However, in April 2012, the DVD version was classified as \"objectionable\" (banned) by the New Zealand Office of Film & Literature Classification.\n\n\"The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)\" opened at 45th place with $49,456, for an average of $2,748, in the 18 theaters where it premiered. With four theaters added the next weekend, the film dropped a modest 29.9% with $34,679. Its third weekend saw a 56.2% drop despite having two more theaters added. However, in its fourth weekend, the film lost 12 theaters, causing a 61.9% drop ($5,792). In its final weekend, it grossed $2,267, putting the movie's resting spot at #95 for the weekend.\n\nThe film grossed $5,824 in Iceland and $1,511 in the United Kingdom. Released in Peru in April 2012, the horror picture grossed $21,111 there. At the end of its run, the film made $141,877, about half of what the previous installment had grossed.\n\nThe film has a rating of 30% at Rotten Tomatoes based on 77 reviews, with a consensus that reads \"\"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)\" attempts to weave in social commentary but as the movie wears on, it loses its ability to repulse and shock and ends up obnoxious and annoying.\" At Metacritic, it rates 17 out of 100, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\", based on 22 reviews.\n\nGiving it a score of 7 out of 10, \"Bloody Disgusting\" writer Brad Miska said the film was a \"brilliant response to critics of his first film. It makes a strong statement that it's just a movie and that people take his work way too seriously, while also implementing a unique concept\". Miska added that he \"found it an intensely engaging and absolutely hilarious meta experience that gets its point across with flying colors\", but was critical of the script's lack of depth. \"Entertainment Weekly\" writer Owen Gleiberman gave the film a B+ rating, stating that viewers \"may feel gripped by the horror of what you're seeing and the terror of what's coming\". Gleiberman noted how \"The scatological climax would have the Marquis de Sade gagging into his popcorn.\" Writing in the \"New York Post\", V. A. Musetto gave the film 3 out of 4 and said \"Full Sequence\" \"is sick, disgusting and vile. (but) It's also demonically funny, stylish and ingenious.\"\n\nJen Yamato, writing for \"Movieline\", criticized the film's excessive gore and the way director Tom Six seemed to dislike his own audience, specifying \"It's not really a film one can or should 'enjoy', which is what Six seems to be telling his own audience, the fans who giggled through \"The Human Centipede\" and demanded more! Gorier! More extreme! Well, those people will get what they asked for.\" Eric Kohn, writing for \"indieWire\", criticized the excessive grotesqueness of the film as well as Six's vanity. He stated, \"Well, what if it turns someone's own body against them—is that a measure of success? To some degree, yes; it's designed to turn the tables on its own gore-hungry fans by depicting a fictionalized version of one of their own so revolting they think twice about their twisted tendencies. But it's so indulgently perverse, and so viscerally disturbing to watch—not to mention a painfully vain exercise in self-worship—that the lesson is incredibly hard-won. Take a word of warning, if you're on the fence; you don't have to see \"The Human Centipede II\" to know you don't want to see it.\"\n\nSome reviewers found the extreme nature of the film boring. Robert Koehler, writing for \"Variety\", found the gore so excessive that he termed it a form of lazy filmmaking. \"More boring than stomach-churning, the film nevertheless contains scattered scenes and sequences so far beyond the tolerance of the squeamish that it can't be overstated; one, detailing the violent birth and death of a baby, is here simply to shock the most jaded of the jaded,\" he wrote.\n\nReviewer Robert Saucedo of InsidePulse.com was more generous toward the film, but found its execution lacking. He wrote, \"The film ... has a hint of intelligence hiding behind its beady little eyes. Smeared with blood and poo as it may be, this intelligence exposes a film that has something to say. The problem, unfortunately, is that director Tom Six is like a child – attempting to make a profound statement but unable to get it out eloquently or even in anything not resembling a whimper or a groan most of the time ... Who would have guessed? \"Human Centipede II\" is a treatise about horror fandom as delivered by a giggling, poop-infatuated toddler.\"\n\nMark Olsen, film critic for the \"Los Angeles Times\", expressed concern over the film's conclusion as well as its basic premise. The conclusion (which he admits is open to interpretation; did Lomax commit these crimes or not?) leaves the audience either believing that the film is a \"cop-out repudiation of everything that has come prior\" or that even more graphic torture is coming in the third film. Regardless, Olsen concluded that writer-director Six has left himself with no good option for the third film.\n\nRoger Ebert, of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", who did not assign a star rating to the original, gave this film zero stars on review, calling it \"reprehensible, dismaying, ugly, artless and an affront to any notion, however remote, of human decency.\" He would later name it the worst movie of 2011.\n\nIn the UK, the reception of the film was just as hostile. Chris Tookey of the Daily Mail compared director Tom Six to recently convicted Dutch murderer Vincent Tabak to argue that such films would lead to the decline of society in a strong criticism of the BBFC: \"That such obviously depraved, exploitative vileness has not been banned, but has instead been granted an 18 certificate, is yet more proof that the BBFC has lost its collective marbles\". Scott Weinberg and Catherine Shoard in The Guardian and Mark Kermode in The Observer praised the BBFC for heavily censoring the film, their only regret being that the BBFC could not make \"The Human Centipede 2\" into a \"better\" film.\n\nSix stated that the third film would again be very different from the previous entry, but would also start with its ending, making the trilogy similar to a centipede. In the end, the parts of the trilogy form one continuous film about four and a half hours long. He also stated that the third film would answer some \"lasting questions\", have a strange happy ending, and is the last of the series, as he does not want to make any more \"Centipede\" films. In an interview with DreadCentral.com, Six said the third film would \"make the last one look like a Disney film. We're going to shoot the third film entirely in America, and it's going to be my favorite... It's going to upset a lot of people.\"\n\nAround late 2012, actor Dieter Laser and Six ended their legal battle about creative differences, which had been ongoing since March 2012. Laser and Harvey returned for the third film, which is set in the United States, and played new characters. Six had said that the film would star a \"big American celebrity,\" have \"a storyline that nobody would expect,\" and feature a centipede consisting of 500+ people.\n\nFilming commenced in May 2013, with Eric Roberts added to the cast. Other cast members include former pornographic actress Bree Olson, Robert LaSardo, and Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister, Jr.. Filming concluded in June, with the film taking place in a prison. The official tagline for the film is \"100% Politically Incorrect.\" \"The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence)\" was released both theatrically and on video on demand on 22 May 2015.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19971458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19971458", "title": "The Russell Brand Show prank telephone calls row", "text": "The Russell Brand Show prank telephone calls row\n\nIn an episode of BBC Radio 2's \"The Russell Brand Show\" broadcast on Saturday 18 October 2008, comedian Russell Brand and presenter Jonathan Ross made prank calls to actor Andrew Sachs that led to controversy in the United Kingdom. Brand and Ross called Sachs to interview him on-air; when he did not answer, they left a series of lewd messages on his answering machine, including comments about Brand's relationship with Sachs' granddaughter, Georgina Baillie. After initially receiving little attention, a 26 October article in \"The Mail on Sunday\" led to widespread criticism of Brand, Ross and the editorial decisions of the BBC, with the event becoming known as \"Sachsgate\" or \"Manuelgate\" (a reference to Sachs' character in \"Fawlty Towers\").\n\nBrand and Ross were criticised by a number of Members of Parliament, including Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and the BBC received a record number of complaints. The BBC suspended Ross while it and Ofcom launched investigations. Both Brand and Radio 2 controller Lesley Douglas resigned from the BBC. On 30 October, the BBC suspended Ross without pay for 12 weeks. The BBC was fined £150,000 by Ofcom.\n\nFrom April 2006 through to October 2008, Russell Brand presented the weekly BBC radio show \"The Russell Brand Show\". In most episodes Brand was joined by his co-host Matt Morgan who would often steer him in certain directions regarding what to talk about. Brand sometimes called in a variety of his celebrity friends as well, including Noel Gallagher, Alan Carr and Jonathan Ross, to talk on the show each week.\n\nOn 11 October 2008, David Baddiel co-hosted Brand's show. Baddiel recalled having met Georgina Baillie at Brand's home and being told that her grandfather was actor Andrew Sachs. According to Baddiel, Baillie said \"Don't tell him I was here!\"\n\nOn Thursday 16 October 2008, Sachs, who famously portrayed Manuel in television comedy \"Fawlty Towers\", was scheduled to be a phone-in guest on Brand's evening radio show. The show was to be pre-recorded due to Brand's work commitments.\n\nAfter being unable to reach Sachs on his home telephone, Brand and his co-host of the week, fellow Radio 2 DJ Jonathan Ross, left Sachs four voice messages. In the first message, Brand joked about \"Fawlty Towers\" and the fact that both he and Sachs had appeared in \"The Bill\", but was interrupted by Ross shouting out \"he fucked your granddaughter\". The rest of the message and the following three messages were all characterised by Brand and Ross attempting to apologise for Ross' outburst, but each quickly descended into farce, with, for example, Brand singing to Sachs: \"It was consensual and she wasn't menstrual\" and Ross asking to marry him. Brand later said that listening to those calls is like hearing 'two idiots dancing towards a canyon.'\n\nOn 25 October, Brand presented his last edition of his radio show with co-host Simon Amstell, which they performed live. Shortly before going on air, Brand was informed that \"The Mail on Sunday\" would be running a story about the phone calls. During the show, Brand apologised to Sachs, but also devoted much of the show to deriding the \"Daily Mail\" for its support of Nazism in the run up to World War II. Even in his apology to Sachs, Brand stated \"what's worse – leaving a swearword on Andrew Sachs' answerphone or tacitly supporting Adolf Hitler when he took charge of the Third Reich?\"\n\nThe incident escalated into a media and political storm that, in much of the British media, eclipsed news of the global financial crisis, the US Presidential election, and fighting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nSachs later stated he had not given permission for the messages to be broadcast. The BBC originally stated that they were \"not aware of any complaint by Mr Sachs\", but later confirmed a complaint had been received, and apologised. Brand issued an apology for making the calls but stated it was \"funny\" during his last radio show, before the \"Mail\" had printed the story. Ofcom, the telecommunications regulator, announced its own investigation. On 28 October 2008, the BBC said that it had received 4,700 complaints, after the calls became international news. Later the same day, this number had passed 10,000. The same afternoon, Prime Minister Gordon Brown called the incident \"clearly inappropriate and unacceptable\". The following day the number of complaints was said to have topped 18,000.\n\nThis incident resulted in the second-highest number of complaints to the BBC in recent years, second only to its airing of \"\".\n\nIn reaction to the telephone calls, Baillie said that her relationship with Brand had been brief and she now felt betrayed that he had revealed it to her grandfather. Baillie called for both Brand and Ross to be sacked by the BBC and stated that she and her family would be considering whether to make a formal complaint to the police. Sachs stated that he had no intention of making a complaint to the police or taking the matter further.\n\nOn 29 October 2008, Director-General of the BBC Mark Thompson announced that Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross were suspended, pending the report of an investigation by Tim Davie, director of BBC audio and music. The suspension meant that, for the week, Ross would not be appearing on his regular \"Friday Night with Jonathan Ross\" television show, \"Film 2008 with Jonathan Ross\", or his Saturday-morning Radio 2 show. Similarly Brand would not be hosting his regular Saturday-night Radio 2 show or appearing as a guest captain on an episode of \"Never Mind the Buzzcocks\" due to be aired on 30 October; the episode had been taped before his resignation, and aired on BBC Two on 19 January 2011, more than 2 years after the incident. Thompson called the events a \"gross lapse of taste by the performers and the production team\" (who chose to broadcast the advance-recorded show) that angered licence-payers. Thompson offered a personal and unreserved apology to Sachs and his family. In an interview, Sachs revealed that he had received and accepted written apologies from Brand and Ross. Brand resigned from the BBC later in the day.\n\nOn the evening of 30 October it was announced that Controller of Radio 2 Lesley Douglas had tendered her resignation, which had been accepted. Her resignation letter did not address the question of whether Douglas herself had approved the pre-recorded show for transmission. That day, Ross was suspended without pay from all BBC shows for a period of 12 weeks.\n\nThe BBC issued an apology on 8 November, stating that the telephone calls were \"grossly offensive\" and a \"serious breach of editorial standards\". The corporation apologised specifically to Sachs and Baillie, and also to licence fee payers. The evening before this formal apology, David Barber, head of specialist music and compliance at Radio 2, also resigned. Like Douglas, he had been aware of the contents of the show, and had sanctioned the segment's broadcast.\n\nFifteen MPs signed a motion in the House of Commons, tabled by Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay and Conservative MP Nigel Evans, calling for Brand and Ross to no longer be funded by the licence fee (which funds the BBC). The chairman of the House of Commons select committee on culture, media and sport, John Whittingdale, stated that an investigation by the BBC was needed, but stopped short of calling for Ross and Brand to be sacked. The chairman of the House of Lords Select Committee on Communication, Lord Fowler, in a letter to The Times (see Fowler in Further reading) stated that there were fundamental flaws in the way that the BBC was regulated and governed, and that there was \"confusion all round\" because two parallel bodies, the BBC Trust and Ofcom, were investigating the incident, and it was both unclear which of them the public should complain to and which of them had precedence over the other.\n\nShadow Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, speaking on the Radio 4 Today Programme on 30 October, also refused to say whether he thought Ross should be sacked, asserting that politicians should remain at \"arm's length\" from such decisions. In a speech at the London School of Economics the previous day he had criticised the decision by the BBC to broadcast the programme, which had been recorded 2 days prior to its transmission, saying that \"[t]he BBC was quite wrong to take the decision to broadcast the offensive phone calls\". He also demurred about calling for the resignations of anyone in BBC management, saying that \"[i]t is wrong, in principle, for politicians to be calling for heads of individual broadcasting to be removed\", and criticised the BBC for not releasing the name of the person who had given the green light for the show to be broadcast.\n\nHunt was speaking to the LSE about socially responsible broadcasting, and stated \"I do think the BBC is a socially responsible broadcaster, I just think we need to hear that.\" He argued that broadcasters were not being ambitious enough, and outlined his party's plans, should it be elected to government at the next general election, to relax regulation for those broadcasters who agreed to provide only socially responsible output. In addition to citing the Ross/Brand/Sachs affair as a \"perfect example\" of where such a \"responsibility deal\" could have operated, he also pointed to Channel 4 as an example, stating that it was \"not good enough\" for it to produce \"worthy\" programmes such as \"Dispatches\" documenting alcohol abuse in the US, whilst at the same time it was broadcasting programmes such as \"Hollyoaks\" where such abuse took up, according to his estimates, 18% of screen time. The culture spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, Don Foster, criticised this idea, stating that it threatened the very foundational principles of freedom and independence of British media, arguing that such government interference in television programming would be \"a very sad day for British broadcasting\", and pointing out that regulatory mechanisms already exist to deal with issues such as this.\n\nOn 29 October, Conservative MP Nadine Dorries had already called for the BBC to terminate the contracts of both Ross and Brand, and in the Commons David Hanson had criticised the comments for being inappropriate and not \"in keeping with broadcasting\". The conservative journalist Charles Moore announced he would not pay his television licence after the BBC's failure to sack Ross, a decision which eventually led to Moore being fined in May 2010.\n\nSecretary of State for Justice Jack Straw, writing in his local newspaper the \"Lancashire Telegraph\" on 30 October (see Straw in Further reading), became the first Cabinet Minister to call for the pair to be sacked, arguing that if both presenters had worked in local radio \"they'd have been given their P45 before you could say 'Jack Robinson'.\"\n\nOn the same day, Shadow Leader of the House of Commons, Theresa May, called for a Commons debate on the BBC's handling of the affair.\n\nIn the days following the suspensions, a number of celebrities, particularly from television and radio, came out in support of Brand and Ross. Many felt that, whilst the incident was unacceptable, it was not deserving of the strong criticism it received, especially when there were other issues troubling the United Kingdom.\n\nRod McKenzie, the editor of BBC Radio 1 \"Newsbeat\", observed on the BBC Editors' weblog (see Further reading) that audience reactions to Brand's and Ross' remarks had been polarised, noting that whilst his colleagues at Radio 4, Radio 5 Live, television, and the BBC World Service had been seeing one thing, the younger audiences of Radio 1 had been reacting quite differently, and were broadly supportive of Ross and Brand. Some were amazed at the comments of the Prime Minister, with one person observing that \"[t]he financial markets are wrecked and all he can do is talk about a petty joke.\" Others stated that people should \"calm down\", \"get a grip\", and that the subject had been \"blown out of all proportion\". McKenzie also characterised the reaction from the news media as containing \"anger: some genuine, some of it synthetic. Some of it comes from the BBC's usual critics.\" He stated that for the people who worked in the media \"profile and salary-envy and schadenfreude may play a part in all this. But how many heard the original transmission and how many are responding to the newspapers' quotes or others' arguments?\"\n\nTim Shaw, disc jockey for Absolute Radio, also supported Ross and Brand, appearing on BBC News wearing a T-shirt that read \"I back Brand.\" The television presenter Paul O'Grady stated that the comedians' behaviour was, \"...well out of order\". However, he also suggested that the Prime Minister should get on with more important matters than complaining about media gossip. Carol McGiffin, a presenter on ITV's daytime programme \"Loose Women\" similarly supported the pair, criticising those who complained and stating that she could not wait to download the official podcast which included the incident.\n\nThen-Oasis leader and friend of Russell Brand, Noel Gallagher, complained that the press had \"dictated the tone\" of the controversy, and thought it \"typical of the English in general\" when \"10,000 people get outraged, but only days after it has happened\". Gallagher claimed to have spoken to Brand, who told Gallagher he was \"going to fall on his sword\".\n\nA petition on the GoPetition web site, calling for the BBC \"to turn blame on the 'Andrew Sachs' incident away from Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross, and instead onto whoever green lighted the show\" had garnered 336 signatures by 29 October. At the same time, a similar group on Facebook had over 1,000 members. By 30 October, the petition had risen to 4,000 signatures and the Facebook group to 15,609 members. By 2 November, the Facebook group had over 30,000 members, which had risen to over 43,000 members by 5 November.\n\nOn 30 October, fans of Ross and Brand protested outside of the offices of the BBC. On 31 October, fans prepared to hold a protest outside of the offices of the \"Daily Mail\" and of the BBC.\n\nComedian Jimmy Carr also expressed his support for Ross, saying the issue had been blown out of proportion, and blamed the media themselves for escalating it further, and that Ross was a \"national treasure\".\n\nFormer celebrity publicist Max Clifford played down the apparent outrage aimed at Brand. In an interview he said \"I don't think this will cause any problems for Russell Brand. He's known to be controversial and, if anything, it will make him more popular amongst his fans, who will have thought this was hilarious...They won't see anything wrong in what he did. It is a big PR success for him...He will have no problem with his career.\"\n\nTV critic and columnist Charlie Brooker stated on his show, \"Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe\", his worry that the controversy would lead to a chilling effect on comedy, and that the BBC and others would self-censor too much in future. He went on to say that the attitude displayed by the complainants and the BBC's backing down would have, in earlier times, precluded the production of much of what was at the time edgy comedy and made culture poorer for it (citing \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", \"The Day Today\" and \"The Young Ones\" amongst others as shows that would have not been commissioned owing to their controversial content). While pouring scorn on those who had complained without seeing the programme, and attacking newspapers that attempted to stir up further controversy (in particular the \"Daily Mail\"), he did not appear to defend Brand and Ross in particular, stating that the possibility of people being offended by some misjudged humour is \"the price you pay for freedom of speech.\" In a further column in \"The Guardian\", he reiterated this point as well as saying that \"people who retrospectively complain to Ofcom about material they've only read about second-hand are, in essence, a bunch of sanctimonious crybabies indulging in a wretched form of masturbation.\"\n\nReacting to the suspension of Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross on 29 October, Baillie remarked: \"I'm thrilled because justice has been done...It's despicable. Calling me that in public, not only does it damage my relationship with my granddad but it could permanently damage my life as well,\" despite having declared apathy to the sentiment referenced in the latter sentence on her Myspace page.\n\nA week later, on 5 November 2008, UK television channel Five broadcast a 1-hour documentary on the incident, titled \"Russell & Ross: What the F*** Was All That About?\" featuring an exclusive interview with Baillie. Baillie stated in the interview that \"I think it's way out of proportion what's happened and I don't hate either of them – I don't at all\", going on to say \"I think they're really talented comedians and I think a world without Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand would be a very sad, dull place.\" She concluded by saying that Brand needed to learn about respecting women, while Ross should just think before he speaks, \"I don't have any harder feeling than that.\" Baillie also made clear that she would not object to the reinstatement of both Brand and Ross.\n\nOn 14 May 2009, Baillie was a guest on the BBC politics and current affairs programme \"This Week\". She was questioned by host Andrew Neil and regular guests Michael Portillo and Diane Abbott about the Brand row within discussion of the general subject of the present day worth and genuineness of public figures saying sorry, in the wake of public apologies from members of parliament (MP's) and Prime Minister Gordon Brown following the events of the MP's expenses row. Asked by Neil if receiving an apology from Brand and Ross had mattered to her, she said yes, as she had been \"publicly offended and humiliated\", and her father \"had been humiliated too\". When asked by Abbott if all the publicity surrounding the Brand row had helped her career, she responded \"not necessarily ... one would think so, but not really.\" Neil further asked if the apology she received had helped, she replied yes, stating \"definitely\" to the follow-up comment from Neil of \"better to get it than not get it?\" When asked finally on the row by Neil if she thought the apologies from Brand and Ross were genuine, she replied that she thought Ross' was, but the fact that Brand had joked about the row on his later tour negated his apology.\n\nIn 2010, Baillie teamed up with singer Adam Ant (whose drummer Hayley Leggs had been a member, alongside Baillie, of burlesque troupe The Satanic Sluts) to compose the song \"Gun in Your Pocket\", about Ross, Brand and the entire affair. He intended to release the song as the lead single for his ninth album \"Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner's Daughter\" (with a rerecording of early 1980s outtake \"Who's A Goofy Bunny Then?\" as the B-side in tribute to the recently deceased Malcolm McLaren). \"Gun in Your Pocket\" was performed live on at least one occasion, at a guerilla gig (one of several he played around this time) at London's Troubadour Café on 2 April 2010, and was setlisted, (but not performed) at Adam's \"Pirate Metal Extravanganza\" concert at the Scala on 30 April 2010, while the recording received a club play when Adam DJ'd at the Family Affair clubnight in Shoreditch, London on 24 April.\n\nThe single, along with its parent album, was put on hold when Adam Ant (who has a history of bipolar disorder and was widely suspected around this time to have been undergoing a manic episode) was once again sectioned on 18 May 2010 and it remained to be seen if a medicated and stabilised Adam would wish to continue this project or not. However, interviewed by The Sun on 31 December 2010 Adam Ant – by his own admission once more unmedicated and now including Baillie on backing vocals in his live band – confirmed the song as still on the album. \"Georgina is a friend of mine who has really been through it. Her grandad still won't speak to her because he is so hurt.\"\n\n\"Gun in Your Pocket\" was finally released in October 2012 as the B-side to \"Cool Zombie\", the eventual first single from the album (which finally emerged in January 2013). In addition to this song, Baillie and Adam Ant composed a second track about the Ross-Brand affair, \"Rubber Medusa\", a song focussed mainly on Brand and written from Baillie's perspective. Baillie's band, the Poussez Posse, performed this second song regularly in live support slots for Ant's UK tours during 2011–2012. Commenting on the two songs in an interview by John Robb, Baillie noted \"The first one that Adam and I wrote was about an ex of mine- guess who! Which is not on the album, which is called \"Gun in Your Pocket\" ...(Subsequently) the first one Adam and I wrote together was \"Rubber Medusa\", which was about Russell, Adam came up with the title which is a quote from the Jubilee film, (Brand) does look like a rubber Medusa so I see why he said it.\"\n\nA number of radio personalities employed by the BBC came out in support of Lesley Douglas, after her resignation. Douglas was aware of the contents of the programme, but had not heard them before they were broadcast. She sanctioned its broadcast with a single word e-mail of \"Yes\" sent from her BlackBerry. Amongst her supporters were Chris Evans and Terry Wogan, both of whom worked for BBC Radio 2 at the time, and Dame Liz Forgan, who called her one of the \"outstanding broadcasters of her generation\", and said that the BBC had \"lost its wits\". Mark Thompson said that because of her knowledge of the broadcast, she had to shoulder some of the responsibility.\n\nRoss had been scheduled to host the 2008 British Comedy Awards for ITV during the period of his suspension from the BBC; however, on 31 October he stepped down.\n\nOn 31 October, Brand left the country, saying that he had work to do in America, including TV programmes and film collaborations with Judd Apatow and Helen Mirren. The second series of Brand's Channel 4 television show \"Russell Brand's Ponderland\" aired as normal on the previous evening, attracting 1 million viewers, the show's largest ever audience. A further 180,000 watched the show time-shifted on the Channel 4+1 timeshift channel. The first series of \"Ponderland\", aired in October 2007, had been watched by 840,000 viewers, including those watching Channel 4+1. The channel reported that it had received 164 complaints from the public, many of these criticising the decision to broadcast the programme, rather than a reflection on the content, and the majority before the programme was transmitted; the show also attracted 212 emails and phone-calls of praise from fans and as such was the most praised programme screened on Channel 4 for that month.\n\nBrand similarly continued to be on the front cover of PETA's \"Vegetarian Starter Kit\" booklet, despite people protesting to the organisation. PETA's director, Robbie LeBlanc, said that Brand, who had previously won PETA's Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrity contest twice, would remain on the cover \"because Mr Sachs, who is also a PETA supporter, has accepted Mr Brand's apology, and that's good enough for us.\"\n\nBrand went on to win the British Comedy Award for Best Live Standup Performer. In his acceptance speech, Brand dedicated his award to Ross.\n\nAfter being taken off the air due to Ross' suspension, \"Friday Night with Jonathan Ross\" returned to BBC One on 23 January 2009, featuring guests Tom Cruise, Lee Evans and Stephen Fry. The show was watched by 5.1 million viewers, an increase from the 3.74 million of the last show before going off air. Ross' return attracted 25 complaints and 3 messages of support to the BBC.\n\nIn 2009, \"Friday Night with Jonathan Ross\" was nominated for a BAFTA. According to \"The Times\", Ross was nominated soon after he was banned. Melody Sachs complained about Ross being nominated so soon after the controversy in an interview with \"The Daily Telegraph\", saying: \"I am amazed that Ross should get rewarded with a mouth like his. Nobody is saying he hasn't got talent, but what he did was so disgusting. Of course he is not worth the money, but he is good at his job. However, I don't think he should be rewarded so soon after what happened. It is like people are saying, 'Let's forget all about it and see what we can give him.' It is wrong and bad timing to give or even put up this guy for recognition when he has done such a terrible thing. It was unforgivable, really. I'm not angry, I just don't believe it.\"\n\nSachs himself said that the nomination was: \"a bit of a surprise\", and that: \"One would question the reasons when it comes so quickly after what happened. I wonder how much it has to do with trying to comfort him. I don't know. That is how it happens. That is showbusiness.\"\n\nOn 21 November 2008, the BBC's watchdog BBC Trust said that the phone calls were a \"deplorable intrusion with no editorial justification.\" The Trust found that the existing BBC guidelines should have been sufficient to have prevented the incident, and that the \"very offensive\" programme should \"never have been recorded.\" It found the failures lay in mistakes made by BBC editorial and compliance management. The Trust gave its backing to the BBC's response to the incident and Ross' 12-week suspension.\n\nEchoing the findings of the BBC Trust, the BBC itself stated the incident was a \"very, very serious failure in a radio programme where editorial judgement was exercised that seriously let the BBC down.\"\n\nThe Trust also criticised Brand's \"so-called apology\" of 25 October, and the staff of Chris Moyles' BBC Radio 1 show for also breaching BBC guidelines for comments by Brand in an interview on the morning of 21 October at a time when children were likely to be listening. The Trust recommended tighter controls for programmes such as Brand's, made by companies owned by their performers. Long-term effects of the controversy would include the setting up of a register of high-risk programmes.\n\n"}

{"id": "41747978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41747978", "title": "Tjioeng Wanara", "text": "Tjioeng Wanara\n\nTjioeng Wanara (; Perfected Spelling: Ciung Wanara) is a 1941 film from the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia) directed and produced by Jo Eng Seka. Starring R Sukran, Elly Joenara and AB Djoenaedi, it featured more than 500 people in supporting roles. The film follows a young prince named Tjioeng Wanara who must reclaim his throne from the cruel King of Galuh; it is adapted from the Sundanese legend of the same name.\n\nThe second production by Star Film, \"Tjioeng Wanara\" was released 18 August 1941. It was advertised heavily, emphasising the fact that the scholar Poerbatjaraka had served as the historical adviser and that the film was based on Balai Pustaka's version of the legend. It premiered to commercial success, but received mixed reviews. This black-and-white production, which was screened until at least 1948, is now thought lost.\n\nIn 1255 Saka, Permana Dikoesoemah is the King of Galuh, beloved by his people and his wife Naganingroem. The minister Aria Kebonan wants power for himself, and persuades the king to surrender the crown to him. Permana Dikoesoemah warns Aria Kebonan to respect him always and not to bother his wife. He then abdicates to meditate, ultimately ascending to a higher plane of existence. Aria Kebonan, meanwhile, magically gains the king's appearance, ensuring that the people of Galuh are unaware that they have a new king.\n\nAria Kebonan proves to be an unpopular ruler. One day, he hears that both Naganingroem and the king's former concubine, Dewi Pangrenjep, are pregnant. With Dewi Pangrenjep, Aria Kebonan plans to eliminate Naganingroem's son. During childbirth the son is replaced with a dog, while Dewi Pangrenjep takes the newborn and throws him into a river. He is later found and rescued by farmers, who name him Tjioeng Wanara. Dewi Pangrenjep, meanwhile, gives birth to a son, Aria Banga.\n\nYears pass, and Tjioeng Wanara grows to be a strong young man. Aria Banga, meanwhile, has taken over the throne and rules with an iron fist, hated and feared by his people. Tjioeng Wanara returns to Galuh and overthrows the king, arresting Aria Kebonan and Dewi Pangrenjep; Aria Banga, however, is able to escape and establish the kingdom of Majapahit. Tjioeng Wanara rules kindly over his people and later moves his capital to Pajajaran.\n\n\"Tjioeng Wanara\" was directed and produced by Jo Eng Sek for Star Film. It was the second production by both Jo and the company, following \"Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman\" in 1941. Poerbatjaraka, a scholar of traditional literature, served as the historical adviser to the production. Cinematography for the black-and-white film was handled by Chok Chin Hsien. By June 1941 production was almost complete.\n\nThe film starred R Sukran, Elly Joenara, AB Djoenaedi, Muhamad Arief, and S Waldy. Waldy had made his film debut in 1940's \"Zoebaida\" for Oriental Film Company, later joining Star for \"Pah Wongso\"; Joenara and Arief had begun their cinema careers in the latter film. \"Tjioeng Wanara\" featured the first on-screen performances by Djoenaedi and Sukran. The stars were supported by over 500 extras and actors in bit parts. As such, JB Kristanto's \"Katalog Film Indonesia\" records the production as the first \"colossal\" film in the Indies, in terms of scale.\n\n\"Tjioeng Wanara\" was based on a Sundanese legend of the same name, retold by M. A. Salmoen in a 1938 Balai Pustaka-published edition which was then adapted by Rd Ariffien; as such, a review in the \"Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad\" found that the film contained little of the original tale except for the characters' names. The film featured traditional arts such as the Serimpi dance.\n\nThough initially slated for a July 1941 release, \"Tjioeng Wanara\" ultimately premiered at the Orion Theatre in Batavia (now Jakarta) on 18 August 1941. It was publicised extensively, often emphasising the role of Poerbatjaraka and using the name of Balai Pustaka, the official publishing house of the Dutch East Indies government known for its printed versions of traditional tales, in advertisements. The film was rated for all ages.\n\nThe premiere of \"Tjioeng Wanara\" was shown to a packed theatre. Reception of the film, however, was mixed. An anonymous review in the \"Soerabaijasch Handelsblad\" was positive, considering the film to be successful in its adaptation of the legend, while another, in the same newspaper, recommended it. Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran, however, writes that some viewers considered the film \"nothing more than a stage play brought to the silver screen\".\n\nStar made four further films before it was closed in 1942, when the Japanese occupied the Indies; Jo Eng Sek did not direct again. After writing \"Tjioeng Wanara\", Ariffien left Star Film to work at a circus; Biran writes that he was disappointed over the work's poor reception. Joenara, Arief, and Waldy remained in the film industry; Joenara went on to be a producer, while Arief and Waldy later took up directing. Neither Djoenaedi nor Sukran are recorded as making another film.\n\n\"Tjioeng Wanara\" was screened as late as June 1948, though it is now likely lost. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. As such, American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, Kristanto records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.\n\n"}
