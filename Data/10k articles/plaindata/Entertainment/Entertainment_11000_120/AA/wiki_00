{"id": "608423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=608423", "title": "Choro", "text": "Choro\n\nChoro (, \"cry\" or \"lament\"), also popularly called chorinho (\"little cry\" or \"little lament\"), is an instrumental Brazilian popular music genre which originated in 19th century Rio de Janeiro. Despite its name, the music often has a fast and happy rhythm. It is characterized by virtuosity, improvisation and subtle modulations, and is full of syncopation and counterpoint. Choro is considered the first characteristically Brazilian genre of urban popular music. The serenaders who play choros are known as chorões.\n\nOriginally \"choro\" was played by a trio of flute, guitar and cavaquinho (a small chordophone with four strings). Other instruments commonly played in choro are the mandolin, clarinet, saxophone, trumpet and trombone. These melody instruments are backed by a rhythm section composed of 6-string guitar, 7-string guitar (playing bass lines) and light percussion, such as a pandeiro. The cavaquinho appears sometimes as a melody instrument, other times as part of the rhythm.\n\nStructurally, a \"choro\" composition usually has three parts, played in a rondo form: AABBACCA, with each section typically in a different key (usually the tonal sequence is: principal key->relative mode->sub-dominant key). There are a variety of choros in both major and minor keys.\n\nIn the 19th century, choro resulted from the style of playing several musical genres (polka, schottische, waltz, mazurka and habanera) by carioca musicians, who were already strongly influenced by African rhythms, principally the lundu and the batuque. The term “choro” was used informally at first to refer to the style of playing, or a particular instrumental ensemble, (e.g. in the 1870s flutist Joaquim Antônio da Silva Callado formed an ensemble called \"Choro Carioca\", with flute, two guitars and cavaquinho), and later the term referred to the music genre of these ensembles. The accompanying music of the Maxixe (dance) (also called \"tango brasileiro\") was played by these choro ensembles. Various genres were incorporated as subgenres of choro such as \"choro-polca\", \"choro-lundu\", \"choro-xote\" (from schottische), \"choro-mazurca\", \"choro-valsa\" (waltz), \"choro-maxixe\", \"samba-choro\", \"choro baião\".\n\nJust like ragtime in the United States, tango in Argentina and habanera in Cuba, choro springs up as a result of influences of musical styles and rhythms coming from Europe and Africa.\n\nIn the beginning (by the 1880s to 1920s), the success of choro came from informal groups of friends (principally workers of postal/telegraphic service and railway) which played in parties, pubs (botecos), streets, home balls (forrobodós), and also the big hits of Ernesto Nazareth, Chiquinha Gonzaga and other pianists, whose musical scores were published by print houses. By the 1910s, many of the first Brazilian phonograph records are choros.\n\nMuch of the mainstream success (by the 1930s to 1940s) of this style of music came from the early days of radio, when bands performed live on the air. By the 1950s and 1960s it was replaced by urban samba in radio, but was still alive in amateur circles called \"rodas de choro\" (choro gatherings in residences and botecos), the one most famous was the \"roda de choro\" in the house of Jacob do Bandolim, in Jacarepaguá, and the \"roda de choro\" in the pub \"suvaco de cobra\" in the Penha.\n\nIn the late 1970s there was a successful effort to revitalize the genre in the mainstream, through TV-sponsored nationwide festivals in 1977 and 1978, which attracted a new, younger generation of professional musicians. Thanks in great part to these efforts, choro music remains strong in Brazil. More recently, choro has attracted the attention of musicians in the United States, such as Mike Marshall and Maurita Murphy Mead, who have brought this kind of music to a new audience.\n\nMost Brazilian classical composers recognize the sophistication of choro and its major importance in Brazilian instrumental music. Radamés Gnattali said it was the most sophisticated instrumental popular music in the world. Heitor Villa-Lobos defined choro as the true incarnation of Brazilian soul.\nNotably, both composers had some of their music inspired by choro, bringing it to the classical tradition. The French composer Darius Milhaud was enchanted by choro when he lived in Brazil (in 1917) and he composed the ballet Le Boeuf sur le toit, in which he quotes close to 30 Brazilian tunes.\n\nAccording to Aquiles Rique Reis (a Brazilian singer), ”Choro is classical music played with bare feet and callus on the hands”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Players control up to 3 UFOs colored red, green and blue that individually can only absorb microbes of their own color. However, by fusing together their UFOs, players can absorb other colors based on additive color mixing.

Players must also avoid absorbing the wrong colored microbe with their UFOs. The game also features a co-operative mode for up to three players that sees each player controlling an individual UFO.\n\nThe game is controlled with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in single player, though only the Wii Remote is required in multiplayer.\n\nThe color matching and absorbing aspects of the game was inspired by the shoot 'em up \"Ikaruga\".\n\n"}

In the game, players fight against enemies using The Director's Pistol, which is a firearm which can be transformed into different shapes. The pistol can also be upgraded to enhance its combat efficiency. In addition, players will have access to various supernatural and telekinetic abilities. For instance, she can use debris to form a defensive shield and hurl objects towards enemies, using them as weapons. Players can acquire Objects of Power by completing side quests or exploring the game's world. They are items which can be used to unlock new skills, such as the ability for Jesse to levitate in air. Remedy added that the game is less linear than its previous games and that players would have plenty of opportunities to explore. In an interview with Polygon in December 2016, Kasurinen said the game would feature cooperative gameplay, but Remedy has since confirmed that \"Control\" will be a single-player game.\n\"Control\" takes place primarily within the Oldest House, a featureless, Brutalist skyscraper in Manhattan that acts as the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Control, a secretive government organization that deals with unexplained or supernatural phenomena. The FBC's goal is to study, contain, and, if possible, seize control of supernatural elements and manipulate them for their own purposes, often regardless of moral considerations. The Oldest House itself acts as the main setting of \"Control\" and is a supernatural place of power, where the FBC contains various Altered Items, objects which have been acted upon by supernatural forces. The Oldest House's topography is constantly shifting, and its interior is vastly larger than its exterior. The FBC has developed ritualistic processes which can alter the Oldest House in certain ways, allowing one to potentially travel infinitely deeper into it, gradually leaving our ordinary reality behind.\nAfter a traumatic childhood experience grants her unexplained supernatural powers, Jesse Faden (Courtney Hope) seeks answers at the Federal Bureau of Control, a clandestine government agency tasked with studying and containing supernatural phenomena. After the Bureau's headquarters, the Oldest House, is invaded by an otherworldly force known only as the Hiss, Jesse is thrust into the role of Director of the FBC via a strange, ritualistic process. Now, haunted by the ghostly remnants of former Director Zachariah Trench (James McCaffrey), Jesse must find her way through the ever-shifting halls of the Oldest House in order to defeat the Hiss and uncover the answers she seeks.\n\nThe game is being developed by Remedy Entertainment. Mikael Kasurinen, who has worked on Remedy's previous project, \"Quantum Break\", is the game's director and Sam Lake served as the game's writer and creative director. Development of the game began before the release of \"Quantum Break\", and as of May 2017, the game was still in preproduction. \"Control\" is powered by the Northlight engine, which was utilized in \"Quantum Break\".\n\nInstead of focusing on creating a large and complex story, the game's writers put more emphasis on creating a game world and universe that is rich enough for players to craft their own stories. Another goal for the team was to create a game that has high replayability. Lake assured players that the game will feature a strong narrative, one that is \"narrowly focused\" according to Kasurinen.\n\nIn May 2017, Remedy announced that they had partnered with 505 Games to publish the game, then codenamed \"P7\". 505 provided marketing and publishing support and a fund of €7.75 million to assist the game's development, while Remedy retained the intellectual property rights to \"Control\". In the press release, Remedy revealed that the game will have complex gameplay mechanics and that it will be a \"longer term experience\" than its previous games. \"P7\" was being worked on by Remedy alongside two other projects. The game was officially revealed at Sony Interactive Entertainment's E3 2018 press conference. It will be Remedy's first game on a Sony platform since 2003's \"\". \"Control\" is set to be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2019.\n"}

Dance bars used to be present only in Maharashtra, but later spread across the country, mainly in cities. Dance bars are a flirtatious world of fantasy catering to the need of feeling of being wanted. \n\nDance bars were banned in the state of Maharashtra in August 2005, which was first struck down by the Bombay High Court on 12 April 2006, and the verdict was upheld by the Supreme Court in July 2013. The Maharashtra government banned dance bars again in 2014 by an Ordinance, but this too was found \"unconstitutional\" by the Supreme Court in October 2015, allowing Mumbai dance bars to reopen.\n\nThe first dance bars were in Khalapur in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, in the early 1980s. The first dance bar in Pune district was hotel Kapila International.\n\nBar dancing in India, markedly differs from erotic dancing and nightclub dance in the Western world and some parts of the Eastern world. In a way, it is more similar to bellydancing performed as entertainment. The dancers, known as bar girls, remain significantly clothed throughout the performance, showing at most some midriff, part of the back, and bare arms. Therefore, the erotic aspect of bar dancing is mostly achieved through suggestion. In Maharashtra, bar dancer attire is often ethnic Indian (sari or lehenga-choli), whereas in some other places, such as Bangalore, it may include Western garb. The bar dances are often compared to \"mujras\", wherein women would dance to live classical Indian music, traditionally performed by tawaif (courtesans) during the Mughal era.\n\nBar girls dance to Bollywood and Indipop numbers on a colourfully lit dance floor, in the central focus of a dance bar's seating arrangement. Patrons sit in chairs lined up against the walls of the room. The dancing is minimalist kind and features no pelvic thrusting and bosom heaving seen typical Bollywood dance, nor any belly-dancing or suggestive gyrations. Most of the time, bar girls reservedly sway to music, in a movement designed for the conservation of energy, until they find a patron whose attention they wish to attract, or are called upon by a patron. They then dance in front of the patron, making fleeting eye contact, pointing, gesturing, or generally making their targeted patron \"feel special\". No bodily contact between the two is allowed, and the bar dancers often stay within the confines of the dance floor. Male waiters hover over patrons and dancers who get too close to each other, both to oversee transactions between the two as well as ostensibly to prevent sex-for-money deals being made. Patrons sometimes shower bar girls with currency notes, which generally results in more animated dancing.\n\nThe patron showers his favoured dancer with currency notes. He does this either by handing over nominal denominations of cash (10 or 20 rupee notes), or through an act known as \"scratching\", where he holds a wad of currency notes above his dancer and rubs notes off the wad down upon the dancer. In some cases, he would even garland the dancer with rupees. Many bar dancers are able to make hundreds of rupees a night in this way, thanks to generous, well-off, and possibly inebriated patrons. At the end of the day, each girl's earnings are counted and split in some predetermined proportion between the dance bar and the girls. The dance bars also make money through the sale of alcohol and snacks. Most women earned up to a month, this attracted women from all over India and even as far away as Nepal and Bangladesh, especially as dance bars was considered by them as a safer way to make a living, than working in the Mumbai's red-light district.\n\nIncome depended on the popularity and status of the bar girl. The \"Hindustan Times\" reported that the less popular girls were given 60% of the amount showered on them. It also stated that popular girls received a monthly salary of 100,000-300,000, while the bar owner kept all the money showered on them.\n\nDance bars closed at midnight, but in 2000, the government changed the rule to permit them to stay open until 1:30 am. However, this was changed to 12:30am, following the rape of a minor at Marine Drive, Mumbai in 2005, although the rape was committed by a police constable inside a police \"chowki\" (station). Once dance bars end by 2 am, the bar owners provide security and safe transport to home the bar dance girls, many of these girls are married with children. Their clients are from all strata of society, including college students, corporate workers and even schoolboys who bribe to get in. \n\nPolicemen and local thugs also make money off regular \"haftas\" from the dance bars. Dance bars serve as a meeting place for criminals, making them a hub for intelligence gathering by police.\n\nLaws were enacted and court cases were filed to shut down the dance bars to advance political fortunes and curry favor with moralist public and also due to the breakdown bribery arrangements between the dance bar owners and authorities who were deeply entrenched in the sexual economy of dance bars.\n\n\nDance bars exist in other parts of India, although they are illegal.\n\nOn 4 June 2006, the Crime Branch of the Delhi Police busted the El Dorado dance bar in Hotel Rajdoot on Mathura Road, and arrested 13 dance bar girls and one of the hotel owners on charges ranging from obscenity to immoral trafficking and abetment. The girls were aged between 20 and 30 and came from lower-middle-class families. Four of them were from Delhi, two each were from Bihar, Noida and Punjab and one each from Kolkata and Allahabad. The girls had previously been employed in Mumbai dance bars, but shifted to Delhi after those establishments were banned.\n\nDance bars have been theme of several movies, such as Chandni Bar. Dance bars are also regularly featured in item songs in bollywood movies.\n\nDance bars were banned in the state of Maharashtra, in August 2005, with the passing of the \"Maharashtra Police (Amendment) Act, 2005\". Subsequently, the government shut down dance bars. However, many continued to flourish as late as 2011, although in a clandestine way in Mumbai and its outskirts. Mumbai alone had 700 dance bars, at their peak in April 2005 when it was banned, though officially only 307 dance bars existed, the rest were illegal, while the figures for rest of the state was 650 dance bars in total. In all they employed 150,000 people, including 75,000 bar girls. These bars functioned as fronts for prostitution. After the ban was enforced, no rehabilitation program was initiated for the nightclub dancers, known as \"bar-balas\". Many moved to Dubai and other Middle Eastern countries, while others went to New Delhi, Chennai and Hyderabad. \n\nThe ban was first struck down by the Bombay High Court on 12 April 2006, and the verdict was upheld by the Supreme Court in July 2013. \"The Hindu\" reported that the number of women employed in bars in Maharashtra was around 20,000 in September 2013. Most of them were waitresses or singers at orchestra bars.\n\nThe Maharashtra government banned dance bars again in 2014 by an Ordinance, but this too was found \"unconstitutional\" by the Supreme Court in October 2015, allowing Mumbai dance bars to reopen.\nOn 25 February 2004, following the raid, the Maharashtra government issued a notification restricting persons below the age of 21 from entering dance bars, discothèques and pubs. Bars violating the law would face fines and possible cancellation of licences. The ban, under the Bombay Prohibition Act, was effective from 1 April 2004.\n\n"}

In 2010, an abridged version of the game developed by Tetraedge Games and published by Chillingo was released in a three-part episodic form for iOS (as Dracula: The Path of the Dragon). The full version of the game was ported to OS X in 2010, published by Coladia. Also in 2010, the three-part iOS version was made available for PC as the Dracula Series. In 2014, the abridged iOS version was made available as a single game on Steam.\n\nThe game follows 2000's \"\" and \"\", although the storyline is unrelated to either game. \"Path of the Dragon\" takes place in 1920, and follows Father Arno Moriani of the Sacred Congregation of Rites, who is sent to the village of Vladoviste in the diocese of Alba Iula in Transylvania to investigate the possible canonization of a recently deceased doctor, Martha Calugarul. However, Moriani soon learns Calugarul believed herself to have been engaged in a battle with a vampire, possibly Dracula himself, and although initially skeptical of the story, he slowly comes to believe there may be some validity to it. A loose sequel to \"Path of the Dragon\" was released in a two-part form in 2013; \"\" and \"\".\n\n\"Path of the Dragon\" was most widely reviewed for the PC, where it received mixed reviews. Most critics praised the graphics, music, sound effects and voice acting, but the gameplay and puzzles received a more mixed response, with some finding the puzzles too esoteric and/or illogical, and others feeling they fit the nature of the game well.\n\n\"Path of the Dragon\" is a first-person point-and-click adventure game, which employs an \"empty\" HUD; the player's inventory is accessible through a button press, which also allows access to a list of objectives, details of all conversations, records of all documents seen and collected, and options for the player to save their game, quit their game, or load a previously saved game. As such, the entire screen depicts only direct gameplay.\nThe game uses a basic point-and-click interface to move the player around and manipulate the game world. Within each screen, the player is free to look around 360 degrees. As the player moves the cursor around the screen it can change into different styles depending on the situation; neutral cursor (no interaction is possible), an arrow (the player can move in the direction indicated), a mouth (the player can speak to the character over whom the option appears), an eye (an area or object can be examined in more detail), a magnifying glass (an object contains important information which needs closer examination), a hand (the player can take the object), a cog (the player must use an inventory item to initiate interaction with the object), a cog with red line (the player is attempting to use the wrong inventory item to initiate interaction), a left-right horizontal arrow (the object can be moved left and right), an up-down vertical arrow (the object can be moved up and down), a circular arrow (the object can be rotated).\n\nWhen the player clicks on a person to whom they wish to speak, a list of conversation topics appear on screen. When the player picks up an item, it is automatically put into an auto-holder rather than the main inventory, and must be transferred manually from the auto-holder to the inventory screen. This allows the player to sort the inventory in any way they wish. A major part of the gameplay is examining documents, which have a separate section in the inventory screen, presenting the player with numerous options. For example, the player can organise the documents in two ways; by title or by the order in which they were found. Players can also \"flag\" documents so as to relate them to particular clues, and can then examine all documents related to any one particular clue together, without having to navigate through non-related documents. The documents screen also includes a \"compare\" view for examining different copies of the same pictures to find differences between them, and all documents can be examined in more detail with a magnifying glass. The game also includes complete copies of the Bible and Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", and each text has a \"random page\" option, which opens the book at a random passage. If done at certain times in the game, the random option can present clues to the player as to how to proceed (when this is the case, the \"random page\" option flashes).\n\nThe 2010 three-part abridged iOS version, which was also released for Windows as the \"Dracula Series\", adds several new features to the game, such as an optional help feature (which highlights interactive zones on each screen), and a \"quick inventory\" (which allows the player to hold one item and access it without having to enter the inventory screen). This version of the game also removes several of the more difficult puzzles and is shorter than the main version of the game, with several cutscenes and plot points absent.\n\nThe game begins in 1920, with Cardinal Felicio Briganti sending Father Arno Moriani of the Sacred Congregation of Rites to the village of Vladoviste in the diocese of Alba Iula in Transylvania to investigate a candidate for sainthood; Martha Calugarul, a physician and scientist who died several months previously. The process is being fast-tracked because Transylvania has recently been annexed by Romania, leaving Catholics in the minority, and the church feels a local saint may help the Catholics reaffirm their identity in relation to the majority Orthodox in the diocese.\n\nUpon arriving at his inn, Moriani meets Ozana, the innkeeper, and Janos Pekmester, a professor in Medieval History, who is in Vladoviste to excavate the nearby ruins of the Castle of Twilight, Vlad Tepes' residence during his time as Voivode. Moriani learns of Calugarul's biography; after becoming a scientist she was badly burned, forcing her to wear a veil over the side of her face. Later, she worked with Professor Heinrich von Krüger investigating a blood disorder called the \"P syndrome\". During the War, she remained in Vladoviste and cared for combatants on both sides. She died in bed, apparently from exhaustion, soon after the war.\n\nThe next day, Moriani meets a reporter, Stephan Luca, who tells him Calugarul was murdered. He shows Moriani files in which Calugarul reports people dying of unexplainable blood loss, prior to which they were prone to sleepwalking and reacting violently to garlic. All of these patients had two small hematomas on their neck when they died, and all had the \"P anomaly\" in their blood. Luca claims Calugarul believed a vampire was at work in Vladoviste, and vowed to walk \"The Path of the Dragon\" to find and confront it. However, because Calugarul believed in vampires and engaged in occult practices to combat them, she cannot be canonized.\n\nMoriani calls Briganti, who tells him to open an investigation proving vampires don't exist. He explains that since the publication of Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", belief in vampires is at an all-time high, and the Vatican wants to put a stop to this superstition. Moriani calls von Krüger, who claims vampirism is actually a blood disorder called the \"P syndrome\", and is thus scientifically explainable. He then heads to Budapest to meet Professor Irina Boczow, an expert in vampire lore. She tells him the history of vampirism, beginning with Lilith, and much to Moriani's surprise, reveals she believes vampires to be real. She gives him a book, \"The Lords of Twilight\", published by the Thule Society, which says that to become a vampire one must complete The Path of the Dragon, an initiation ritual, something Tepes did in his youth.\n\nMeanwhile, Luca decides to walk The Path of the Dragon alone, believing he will meet Dracula at the end, who he plans to kill. Moriani writes his report refuting vampires, but the next morning, Luca is found shot dead, and Moriani decides take up Luca's plan. Amongst Calugarul's correspondence he finds evidence The Path begins where Tepes was held prisoner in Turkey, and so travels to the jail in the mountains, where he discovers prisoners were left as food for a creature living in the forest so she would spare the nearby villagers. Tepes, however, apparently escaped. Upon returning to Vladoviste, Moriani learns Ozana has been told by the Iron Guard to get him out of the inn, and the villagers no longer want to speak to him. He calls Boczow to tell her he plans to walk The Path to kill whatever he finds at the end of it, and she advises he come see her.\n\nUpon arriving in Budapest, however, he finds her murdered. He returns to Vladoviste to find his friend, Dr. Maria Florescu, Calugarul's replacement, is missing. In a nearby shed, he discovers an unconscious Pekmester in a coffin. In the inn, he finds a bomb on his door. He disarms it, and Ozana tells him Pekmester and a man from Alba Iula had been in his room. He enters Pekmester's room, and discovers Pekmester and von Krüger are members of the Thule Society, and have been working with the Iron Guard. He also learns von Krüger has been in touch with a young member of the DAP, who he believes to be much more \"enterprising\" than Anton Drexler. As such, he has sent Pekmester an extract of a manifesto the young man is working on - an early version of \"Mein Kampf\". Moriani ascertains von Krüger and Pekmester are attempting to walk The Path, which they believe ends in the Castle of Twilight, in an effort to become vampires. He also learns Pekmester has discovered Calugarul's grave to be empty.\n\nMoriani is able to enter a secret passage in the hills leading into the Castle. In an underground labyrinth, he encounters Pekmester, who explains Florescu is a servant of Dracula. He went to see her in the dispensary hoping she would lead him to Dracula, but Dracula knocked him out, put him in the coffin and he woke up in the labyrinth. Eventually, Moriani enters the catacombs. Von Krüger arrives in the courtyard above, begging Moriani to let him down, but Moriani refuses. Florescu arrives, and reveals she is/was Calugarul. When she followed The Path with the intention of killing Dracula, he offered her immortality and her beauty back, and she accepted. She explains Pekmester killed both Luca and Boczow, and von Krüger is the head of the Thule Society, who wish for another World War. She wishes Moriani luck as Dracula himself approaches. However, Moriani ignites the bomb he disarmed at the inn, and the catacombs are destroyed. As Moriani dies, Pekmester laments they have lost their chance, but von Krüger assures him they will return. Unseen by any of them, a green vapour rises from the rubble into the air.\n\nThe game cuts to London 1942. In a bunker, Captain Cunningham of the British Army is interrogating Pekmester. Cunningham wants to know the nature of a secret Nazi operation in 1941 headed by General von Krüger codenamed \"Operation D\". Pekmester asks Cunningham if the name Vlad Tepes means anything to him. Cunningham is dismissive, and Pekmester asks \"Don't you believe in vampires?\" as the lights in the room go out.\n\nTo help promote the release of \"Path of the Dragon\" in North America, for Halloween 2008, Microïds ran a stencil-based pumpkin carving competition, the winners of which received a free copy of the game. Also for Halloween 2008, The American Red Cross held a Dracula themed Blood Drive at five locations in Northern California, where each donor was given a free copy of the game.\n\nIn late 2009, Anuman Interactive acquired the complete back catalogue of Microïds games, and in March 2010, announced \"Path of the Dragon\" was being ported to iOS by Tetraedge Games, published in three separate parts by Chillingo. Stéphane Longeard, director-general of Anuman, stated\n\nThe iOS version proved a success, and upon the release of the third part, Alain Milly, Anuman's editorial-director stated \"We are happy to see that our \"Dracula\" license has found its logical audience on iPhone and iPod Touch. This product has enabled us to test the adaptation of a proper license straight from the Microïds catalog on a mainstream audience. Other licenses will most certainly follow.\" In July 2010, HD versions of each of the three parts were released for the iPad.\n\nIn October 2010, Anuman announced the three-part iOS version would also be released for Windows, under the title of \"Dracula Series\". Alain Milly explained the idea behind releasing the abridged version for the PC was \n\nFranck Berrois, producer of the \"Dracula Series\", further explained \"In the age of dematerializing content, dividing the story into three chapters presents an advantage for players. It enables them to download the part of the story that they want to play very quickly.\"\n\nThe PC version of the game received \"mixed or average reviews,\" and holds an aggregate score of 65 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on eleven reviews. Combined global sales of \"Dracula 3\" and its predecessors, \"Dracula\" and \"Dracula 2\", reached 1 million copies by 2009.\n\nAdventure Classic Gaming's Mervyn Graham scored the game 5 out of 5, calling it \"amongst the best adventure games released in recent years.\" He praised the gameplay, writing \"\"Dracula 3: The Path of the Dragon\" is a cut above the rest. Gamers will appreciate the effort that the developer has put into developing a convincing storyline that leads the player from country to country down the Path of the Dragon. Some puzzles are straightforward, but other puzzles are more perplexing, albeit logical.\"\n\nAdventure Gamers' Cameron Urquhart scored it 4 out of 5. He praised how the game used factual historical information in its fictional narrative, and was also impressed with the graphics, sound and voice acting. He was also complementary of the puzzles; \"Rather than being loaded down with contrived puzzles for padding, \"Dracula 3\" relies heavily on inventory puzzles, yet you are never resigned to trying everything on everything. The hotspots are almost always necessary, while puzzles are logical and accessible and never feel out of place.\" He concluded \"The game rarely wows you in any one way, and the pace can drag at times in dry subject matter, but overall it's both logical and accessible, with [an] interesting approach to vampire lore and deftly crafted storyline.\"\n\nIGN's Emily Balistrieri scored it 7.2 out of 10. She too praised the graphics, sound and voice acting but was critical of the puzzles, saying \"forget blood-sucking, these puzzles are \"soul\"-sucking,\" and concluding \"There are definitely gamers out there who, rather than dashing out boss brains, prefer to have their own splattered all over. The price of admission to a PC adventure with such high production quality might just be your sanity! If code breaking, chemistry, and arcane rituals are your ultimate brain-melt fondue, though, bare your neck for \"Dracula 3\".\"\n\nGameSpot's Brett Todd scored it 5 out of 10, writing, \"Busywork puzzles and stone-age visuals drain the creeps out of this supposedly scary saga, which unfolds more like an uninspired detective story than an ominous encounter with a legendary monster.\" He was also critical of the graphics and sound; \"Most scenes are grainy, and character models are afflicted with slow-motion movement tics that makes it seem like everybody you meet is underwater.\" He also disliked many of the puzzles, and concluded \"\"Dracula 3\" is dry, traditional, and stilted [...] Adventure gamers with a taste for methodical puzzle-solving could appreciate it, whereas everybody else will be too busy stifling yawns to feel any chills running down their spines. This is a vampire-inspired adventure by the numbers that holds few surprises in its dry puzzles and dated presentation values.\"\n\nBenoît Hozjan's script for \"Path of the Dragon\" won the award for \"Best Scenario\" at the 2008 Milthon Festival du Jeu Vidéo. The game was also nominated in two other categories, \"Best PC Game\" and Yan Volsy for \"Best Soundtrack\", losing to \"TrackMania United Forever\" and Yubaba, Smith, and Fortune's score for \"Big Bang Mini\", respectively.\n"}

It is played in Nepal, Rajasthan (India), and Thailand. England and Scotland regularly field teams. Equipment consists of a standard polo ball and six to ten foot cane (similar to bamboo) sticks with a polo mallet head on the end. The pitch is three-quarters of the length of a standard polo pitch, due to the lower speed of the elephants. Two people ride each elephant; the elephants are steered by mahouts, while the player tells the mahout which way to go and hits the ball.\n\nElephant polo originated in Meghauli, Nepal. Tiger Tops in Nepal remains the headquarters of elephant polo and the site of the World Elephant Polo Championships.\n\nElephant Polo in Nepal and Thailand is played under the auspices of the World Elephant Polo Association. WEPA enforces strict rules regarding elephant welfare and game play. Other tournaments, such as those played in India and Sri Lanka, are managed independently of each other and the World Elephant Polo Association. Sri Lanka held an annual tournament in Galle under the auspices of the Ceylon Elephant Polo Association. In 2007 an elephant went on a rampage during a game, injuring two players and destroying the Spanish team's minibus.\n\nAllegations of cruel treatment of polo elephants, made by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, have led to match cancellation, sponsorship withdrawal and the removal of references to elephant polo records in the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nThe Thailand Elephant Polo Association announced in October 2018 that it will end polo matches in Thailand.

It was founded in January 2000 by Alexis Le Dressay, a architect, and Cedric Le Dressay, a software engineer. The company currently focuses on developing real-time strategy games for the PC and Macintosh platforms, but also has developed games for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in the past.\n\nOn February 14, 2018, a statement was released through Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV, Union of Video Game Workers) in which 21 out of 44 workers claimed that Eugen Systems had denied overtime pay, delayed paychecks, reduced gross wages below French minimum wage requirements, and failed to honor contractual and collectively bargained obligations, and that they were going on strike until their demands were met. Eugen Systems released a statement denying the majority of these allegations, but admitting to two instances of delayed payrolls due to technical issues, rather than malicious intent. STJV set up a crowdfunding campaign to raise money to support the employees on strike. A statement from STJV a week later indicated that the strike was representative of a deeper lack of respect within the video game industry of programmers' experience and other abilities. Employees who were on strike met at each other's homes to support each other and plan meetings with the press, labor advocates, and politicians.\n\nStaff representative Félix Habert stated that it took two weeks for Eugen Systems leadership to approached him and others to resolve the issue and the first meeting did not take place until March 5. A statement from STJV about this meeting stated that Eugen Systems denied that the employees' contracts were accurate or enforceable, and that the following day they sent a proposal for ending the strike that was \"incomplete\" and \"not serious.\"\n\nFrench Deputy Sébastien Leclerc spoke out against the strike in favor of Eugen Systems, saying that the strike was motivated by the \"political positioning\" of the strikers and calling it a \"hostage taking\". Le Monde later revealed that Leclerc and the wife of the CEO of Eugen Systems knew each other very well and that she was one of his supporters during his 2017 election campaign, creating a conflict of interest in dealing with the strike.\n\nOn April 3, 2018, the strike was ended by employees saying: \"We do not think we will gain any additional ground with this strike, despite the fact our grievances are simply about conforming to labour laws and collective labour agreements\". Fifteen of the 21 employees sought to take their grievances to the French Labour Court. The website for collecting donations was shut down a few days after this announcement. \n\n"}
{"id": "629176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=629176", "title": "Fear Factor", "text": "Fear Factor\n\nFear Factor is an American stunt/dare game show that originally aired on NBC from 2001 to 2006. It was later revived by NBC in 2011, only to be cancelled again in 2012. The show was revived a second time in 2017 to air on MTV. The original Dutch version was called \"Now or Neverland\". When Endemol USA and NBC adapted it to the American market in 2001, they changed the name to \"Fear Factor\". The show pits contestants against each other in a variety of stunts for a grand prize, usually of US $50,000. From seasons one to five, the contestants were generally three men and three women, all competing for themselves, but in season six, the show moved to a permanent format of four teams of two people, each with a pre-existing relationship with one another. The show was originally hosted by comedian and UFC commentator Joe Rogan, produced by Matt Kunitz and David A. Hurwitz, and directed by J. Rupert Thompson. Rapper/actor Ludacris took over as host when the show was rebooted in 2017.\n\nAs NBC's answer to the successful series \"Survivor\", the show was initially a hit for the network in the summer of 2001, and built strong ratings and popularity for the next couple of seasons. Joe Rogan, then known for his role on the sitcom \"NewsRadio\" (1995-1999) and as a commentator for Ultimate Fighting Championship was hired as the host. According to a 2015 interview with Art Bell, Rogan expected \"Fear Factor\" would be cancelled after a few episodes due to objections with some of the content and further reported that he took the job mainly to obtain observations and anecdotes for his stand-up comedy career.\n\nThe series had a runaway success during the first few seasons, but after the series' fourth season, the popularity and ratings for \"Fear Factor\" began to decline. By 2006, when \"Fear Factor\" was in its six season, the ratings for the series were in steep decline as a result of content concerns and a growing loss of viewer interest, coupled with the series facing tough competition with other TV shows in the same time slot. As a result, the series was only averaging a 2.6 in the ratings. Later that year, \"Fear Factor\" faced tough competition with the TV ratings champion, Fox's talent series \"American Idol\" on Tuesday nights, and the ratings declined further, and continued to trend further downward during this period. Despite much publicity concerning an improved format and better stunts for Season Six, the series' ratings continued to drop and consequently, NBC put the struggling program on hiatus for the remainder of the season to make room for the sitcom \"Joey\", which was removed from the NBC lineup a few weeks later. After a continuous and steep drop in the series' ratings, it was officially cancelled by NBC in May 2006 after six seasons and the network began airing the remainder of the season on June 13, 2006, with the remaining episodes to be aired throughout the summer, with its last episode airing on September 12, 2006. In 2004, \"Fear Factor\" became the first network reality show to be syndicated. Over its six seasons, \"Fear Factor\" earned NBC a reported $600 million in advertising revenue. Currently only the first season has been released on DVD, but in early 2009, plans were made to release a box set containing the entire series on DVD. The project was put on hold for an unknown reason in March 2010. On June 5, 2010, it was announced that the project was cancelled because of the low sales of the first season DVD.\n\nWith Chiller airing reruns of the show every Sunday night, the ratings on Chiller led to Comcast informing \"Entertainment Weekly\" in a May 31, 2011 report that \"Fear Factor\" would be revived for a new season. Eight episodes were ordered, with two of them being two-hour episodes and Rogan returning to the hosting duties. The revival was shot in high-definition, and owing to concerns over the then-ongoing NFL Lockout and the loss of \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" episodes, TV Guide reported in early July the show could be ready as early as September as lockout replacement programming. (NBC eventually lost one episode, the season premiere Hall of Fame Game, because of the lockout that ended in late July) The program began airing December 12, 2011, with the final episode airing July 16, 2012. On May 13, 2012, NBC announced that \"Fear Factor\" was officially cancelled.\n\nIn April 2017, MTV announced that it would be reviving \"Fear Factor\" a second time for 12-episode season. The first season of MTV's \"Fear Factor\" premiered on May 30, 2017 and concluded on August 22, 2017. Just prior to the first-season finale, it was announced that MTV had renewed the series for a second season consisting of 20 episodes. The second season, subtitled \"Season From Hell\", began airing on February 25, 2018. The MTV revival is hosted by Ludacris and continues to use the format of four teams competing for a $50,000 prize. The stunts draw inspiration from elements of pop culture, such as horror movies, urban legends, and viral videos.\n\nIn addition to Chiller, reruns of \"Fear Factor\" have aired in syndication, on FX and MTV2. The series also has a YouTube channel, where previously unaired footage is shown.\n\nBefore the contestants are introduced (and at the half-way point of a two-hour special), Rogan gives a verbal disclaimer. The wording has changed with certain versions, but this is one most commonly used:\n\nBefore Rogan gives a verbal disclaimer, the narrator gives a statement, and this is one most commonly used:\n\nThe normal format involves three men and three women, or four teams of two people with a pre-existing relationship, who have to complete three professional stunts to win US$50,000. If a contestant/team is too scared to attempt a stunt, failed to complete a stunt, or (in some cases) had the worst performance on a stunt, they are eliminated from the competition. If only one contestant/team successfully completes the first or the second stunt, they automatically win $25,000, and the other contestants eliminated in the stunt along with the winner of the stunt return for the next stunt to compete for the remaining $25,000. If no one successfully completed the first or the second stunt, then all of the contestants/teams eliminated in the stunt would return to the next stunt to compete for a reduced $25,000 (this rule did not apply for non-elimination stunts). The only exception to this was in season one, where if one person completed the stunt, then the completer won $10,000 and the $50,000 grand prize was not reduced.\n\nOnly once in the history of \"Fear Factor\" did the $50,000 top prize go unclaimed in an episode. This happened on a Best Friends edition on September 27, 2004, when none of the remaining teams were able to complete the final stunt. In the stunt, one member of each team had to drive a ramp car, while the other member had to drive a sports car. The one driving the sports car had to drive it onto the truck bed via the ramp car. If the sports car fell off of the truck bed at any time, the team was automatically eliminated. Had it been successfully completed, the team who did this the fastest would have won. However, the last remaining contestants walked away with two Mazda vehicles for winning a previous stunt (see Second stunt).\n\nAfter the acquisition of Universal Studios of Vivendi by NBC's parent company General Electric in 2004, contestants could win vacations in order to promote the theme park division of NBCUniversal at Universal Orlando, or win trips to Universal Studios in Hollywood.\n\nThe order of the stunts on a typical episode of \"Fear Factor\" is as follows:\n\nFirst stunt: The first stunt is designed to physically test each of the contestants or teams (for example, jumping from one building to the next or hanging from a helicopter and collecting flags on a ladder). Usually, the two men and the two women, or the three teams, that gave the best performance (such as the fastest time, farthest distance, or number of flags collected in under a certain time) will move on to the second stunt. The others are eliminated.\n\nSecond stunt: The second stunt is meant to mentally challenge the contestants or teams. The three most common types of stunts in the second round are eating stunts, animal stunts, and retrieval/transfer stunts. Eating stunts entail ingesting vile animal parts, live bugs, or a blended concoction of multiple items; animal stunts entail immersing one's head or entire body in animals considered to be disgusting or intimidating (such as rats, spiders, snakes, or worms); retrieval/transfer stunts entail retrieving items or gross objects (often by mouth) hidden in disgusting substances (for example, blood or lard) or live animals. Less often, the second stunt involves a pain endurance challenge or embarrassment tolerance challenge, such as outlasting competitors in a tear gas chamber, walking on broken glass with bare feet, getting a tattoo, having their head shaved, getting piercings, or ingesting habanero peppers. With the exception of retrieval/transfer stunts, contestants are usually not eliminated after this stunt unless they fail to complete it or vomit before finishing. In the case of teams, one team may be eliminated for having the worst performance. In later episodes, a common (but not always used) rule was that no one would be eliminated after the second stunt; instead, the contestant or team that performed the best would receive a prize, such as a vehicle or a prize package similar in value. More often than not, the contestant/team with the best performance had the privilege of choosing the order that the contestants/teams had to go in to perform the next stunt [for the following day].\n\nThird stunt: The third and final stunt is usually something from an extreme type of stunt seen in an action film. Like the first stunt, it usually involves heights, water, vehicles, or some combination of the three. In order to avoid ties, this stunt is always competitive. The player or team with the best performance this round wins the grand prize, usually $50,000, and has the privilege of being informed by Rogan that \"evidently, fear is not a factor for you\".\n\nThis was typically a 90-minute episode featuring four stunts instead of three. The first such episode aired in Season 3 and was notable for a stunt involving body piercing. In Seasons 4 to 6, at least one of the four stunts was a non-elimination stunt in which contestants competed for a prize. The four-stunt format was sometimes used in conjunction with themed episodes, such as Family Fear Factor, Twins Fear Factor, and Thanksgiving Fear Factor. In Season 5, six contestants from other reality shows competed in a two-hour, four-stunt episode for $50,000.\n\nSome \"Fear Factor\" competitions consisted of five or more stunts and featured an increased grand prize. These competitions were always presented as multi-part episodes or single two-hour episodes. The first such competitions were the Tournaments of Champions in Seasons 2 and 3 (see below). Season 4 included a two-hour season premiere in which twelve contestants competed in six stunts for a grand prize of $1,000,000; and a two-part, six-stunt Las Vegas episode where the winner would have a chance to win up to $100,000 based on his or her performance in the final stunt (they would then have to bet half their winnings on a hand of blackjack). Season 6 featured two three-episode, six-stunt competitions (\"Psycho Fear Factor\" and \"Reality Stars Fear Factor\"). Season 7 included two five-stunt competitions in which five teams competed for a grand prize of $100,000; the first aired as a single two-hour episode, and the second aired in two parts.\n\nTournament of Champions: The second and third seasons concluded with a Tournament of Champions featuring the winners of each show in that season and a $100,000 grand prize. In Season two, the thirteen non-celebrity winners were divided into groups of eight men and five women. For the first four stunts, men competed amongst men and women competed amongst women, in two stunts each. The men had to release a flag from a locked box while hanging suspended in the air and eat three different items from a table. The women had to collect flags while on top of an aircraft and retrieve three poles from a tank with alligators. The stunts narrowed the contestants down from eight men and five women to two men and two women who will, in the end, compete against each other for the grand prize by using a key to activate a horn while riding on a speeding truck. In Season three, the twenty-four winners were divided into two groups of twelve, each containing seven men and five women. In the first semifinal episode, the group was cut from twelve to six to three to two finalists. In the second semifinal episode, the group was cut from twelve to six in the first stunt, then the men competed amongst the men and the women competed amongst the women in the second stunt, and then the final four contestants, two men and two women, were cut to two finalists. Each finalist won a 2004 Mazda RX-8 and a chance at the $100,000. In the finals, the four finalists competed in three stunts. Each stunt eliminated one contestant, and the final stunt determined the winner.\n\nCouples Fear Factor: Seasons 4 and 5 both included \"Couples Fear Factor\" competitions that played out over seven episodes and featured a grand prize of $1,000,000. Nine couples competed in 17 stunts in Season 4, and eight couples competed in 14 stunts in Season 5. In Season 4, each episode contained two or three stunts, with at least one stunt being a non-elimination stunt. In Season 5, each episode featured two stunts; the first was always a non-elimination stunt, and the second usually eliminated the team with the worst performance. In contrast to the regular format, only one team was eliminated in each elimination stunt; if multiple teams failed the stunt, then the teams that succeeded would vote on which failing team to eliminate. Almost every stunt offered a prize (e.g., cars, vacations, pre-loaded credit cards, a chance to steal a desired prize from another team) or a $10,000 incentive to the team with the best performance. \"Couples Fear Factor\" episodes had certain stylistic differences from the regular format, including a different opening sequence, and onscreen interviews with the contestants (regular episodes usually presented interviews in voiceover format only).\n\nPsycho Fear Factor: A three-episode series in which six couples competed in six stunts for various cash and prizes, including a grand prize of $250,000. The stunts were centered around the Bates Motel on the set of the original \"Psycho\" horror movie from Paramount Pictures. Unlike other Fear Factor episodes, contestants were required to sleep in the filthy Bates Motel between stunts and were subjected to Fear Factor pranks and mini-challenges while in the motel.\n\nReality Stars Fear Factor: A three-episode series in which five teams of Reality TV stars competed in six stunts for various cash and prizes, including a grand prize of $150,000. The series featured teams from \"The Amazing Race\", \"Survivor\", \"American Idol\", \"The Apprentice\", and \"The Real World\". \n\nCelebrity special (Seasons two, three, and six):\nIn Seasons 2 and 3, episodes with celebrity contestants were played in the normal format, except that contestants were playing for charity. The winning contestant's charity would receive $50,000, and other contestants' charities would receive a lesser amount ($10,000 or $25,000). In Season 6, eight celebrity contestants paired up into teams of two for the first two stunts but competed individually in the final stunt. Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Richardson and Alan Thicke are among the celebrities who have competed on \"Fear Factor\". Season 2 included an episode featuring six WWF/E stars; it was won by Matt Hardy.\n\nAll-Gross Show (Seasons three to six):\nAll three stunts on this show followed the format of the second (gross) stunt as described above. The first such episode involved bobbing for objects in a vat containing 50 gallons of cow blood. In seasons four and five, the all-gross format was used for Halloween-themed episodes. In season six, a \"Farm Fear Factor\" episode featured all gross stunts.\n\nMixed Team and Individual Stunts (Seasons two, five, and six):\nIn most episodes, contestants competed individually or in teams of two for the entire competition. However, there were three episodes in which contestants paired up into teams for the first and/or second stunt but competed individually in the final stunt. The first instance of this was a Season 2 episode in which three pairs of twins competed as teams in the first stunt, and competed individually the second and third stunts. In Season 5's \"New York vs. L.A.\" episode, the first stunt narrowed a pool of eight contestants down to four (one man and one woman from each city); contestants from the same city then teamed up in the second stunt, and all contestants competed as individuals in the final stunt. A Season 6 celebrity episode had contestants competing as teams in the first two stunts and individually in the final stunt. In the latter episode, contestants were allowed to attempt the stunts alone if their partner quit before the stunt started.\n\nHoliday specials (Seasons three to five):\nOver the course of the series, Fear Factor produced three Christmas episodes, two Halloween episodes, and a Thanksgiving episode. The Christmas episodes featured Christmas-themed stunts but were otherwise played in the normal format. The Halloween episodes followed the all-gross format, and the Thanksgiving episode followed the four-stunt format.\n\nLas Vegas Show (Seasons three to five):\nStunts took place at various hotels and casinos in Las Vegas. The show's winner was required to bet at least half of their winnings on one hand of Blackjack, with the chance to continue gambling if successful.\n\nSpecial Contestants (Seasons two to seven):\nSome episodes featured a specific type of contestant (e.g., models, all-female, twins, military members, reality TV stars, freaks and geeks, young and old, returning contestants) or teams with a specific type of relationship (e.g., couples, newlyweds, siblings, best friends, parent/child teams, exes). Many of these episodes were played in the regular format, although some used a four-stunt or extended competition format.\n\nFear Factor Super Bowl Halftime Show (Season two):\nPlayed in the normal format with \"Playboy\" Playmates. The first stunt aired as counter programming to the Super Bowl halftime show and ended right before the third quarter of the game started. The remaining two stunts were shown immediately after the game as counter programming to the Super Bowl lead-out show.\n\nMiss USA (Seasons three to five):\nPlayed in the normal format with Miss USA contestants, with the winning contestant keeping $25,000 and giving $25,000 to a charity of their choice. There was no Miss USA edition in the sixth season of \"Fear Factor\", as NBC produced a Miss USA edition of \"Deal or No Deal\" instead; the Miss USA contestants were the briefcase models for the entire episode. The next time that Miss USA delegates would be involved in a game show was in 2010 on \"Minute to Win It\". The Miss USA edition was not present in the show's final two seasons, as the current format had four teams of two people.\n\nBlind Date (Season six):\nFour single men were introduced to four single women, and either the women (in the first episode) or the men (in the second episode) got to choose their partner among the available contestants of the opposite sex. The game was then played in the regular format, with the winning team dividing the prize.\n\nSleep Deprivation (Season four):\nFive co-ed pairs of contestants competed as teams in the normal format, with one exception: contestants had to stay awake for the 48-hour duration of the competition. If a contestant fell asleep at any time before the final stunt was completed, his or her team would be eliminated. This was the only episode in the TV series in which contestants could be eliminated in the downtime between stunts.\n\nMillion Dollar Heist: (Season six): Played in the regular teams format, but instead of competing for the normal $50,000 prize, teams would race head-to-head to \"steal\" up to $1,000,000 worth of gold from an armored truck submerged in water for their final stunt. The team that \"stole\" the most money's worth of gold within the time limit would win the combined amount of money collected by both teams.\n\nHome Invasion: This short segment was included at the end of each episode in Season six. It involved Joe Rogan going to different homes across America and challenging a family to compete in a stunt. Each stunt usually involved the contestants, under time limit (usually one minute), ingesting or bobbing in something foul or undesirable. If successful, the family would win up to $5,000 in the form of pre-loaded credit cards from Capital One.\n\nThe series revival began airing on December 12, 2011, and the two premiere episodes were viewed by 8.7 million and 8.5 million viewers, respectively. This makes the premiere the highest non-sports programming to air on NBC at 8:00 p.m. since February 2008. Following Rogan's word for a verbal disclaimer, the narrator gives a statement, and this is one most commonly used:\n\nThe revival featured four teams of two people with a preexisting relationship per episode, rather than the original versions' six people (three males and three females). The first five seasons had typically used the three male, three female grouping, but the sixth and final pre-revival season always utilized 4 teams of two people each. The stunts have remained basically the same, with the \"gross\" one in between the two physical ones.\n\nNBC pulled a two-hour, five team, five stunt episode entitled \"Leeches & Shaved Heads & Tear Gas, Oh My!\" which featured a stunt where teams spun a wheel to determine whether they would have to shave their heads and eyebrows, get tattooed, or be tear gassed. This episode was scheduled to air in two parts on January 23 and 30, 2012, but it was postponed after Part 1 was replaced by a GOP debate.\n\nAnother episode, entitled \"Hee Haw! Hee Haw!\" and featuring a stunt where contestants drink the urine and semen of a donkey, was then scheduled to air January 30, 2012. Hesitant about airing the stunt, NBC eventually pulled the episode after pictures of the stunt appeared online. Video footage of the stunt appeared online after the episode aired on Danish TV in June 2012, and \"Fear Factor\" eventually posted short clips of all three stunts on their YouTube channel in July 2014.\n\nThe sixth episode, entitled \"The Bees Are So Angry\", was two hours instead of the usual one, and included five teams, five stunts, and a $100,000 prize instead of the usual four teams, three stunts, and $50,000 prize. Following this episode, \"The Voice\" replaced the series' slot on Monday nights.\n\nNBC rescheduled the two hour \"Leeches & Shaved Heads & Tear Gas, Oh My!\" episode, which aired in two parts over the nights of July 9 and July 16. The first part ended with the \"To Be Continued\" subtitle followed by a preview for the second part. As of July 2012, \"Fear Factor\" was officially cancelled.\n\nMTV's \"Fear Factor\" revival continues to use the format of four teams of two people competing in three challenges for a $50,000 grand prize, as in Seasons 6 and 7 of the NBC series. As the show started, Ludacris gives a verbal disclaimer. The wording has changed with certain versions, but this is one commonly used:\n\nHowever, the order of the stunts, as well as some of the rules, differ from the original format. Each episode of the MTV version has three named rounds: Beat the Beast, Face Your Fear, and The Final Fear.\n\nBeat the Beast: This stunt challenges the contestants to conquer their fear of something creepy (usually live creatures considered gross or intimidating) and generally follows the same format as animal stunts from the second stunt of the original version. The team with the best performance in this round wins a \"FearVantage\", which is an advantage in the next round (such as picking the order).\n\nFace Your Fear: This is a challenge tailored to a common fear shared by all of the contestants on a particular episode. The nature of this stunt varies widely depending on the fears of the contestants.\n\nThe Final Fear: This is an extreme physical stunt that follows the same format as the first and third stunts from the original version of the show. The team with the best performance wins the $50,000 grand prize.\n\n\"Fear Factor\" has received criticism from the general public mainly because of the show's second stunt, which intends to disgust its viewers. The American Humane Association expressed concerns for allowing various animals to get injured, and even killing insects by eating them alive during the videotaping of the show. The association also revealed that professional animal trainers have refused to work on the show because the producers of \"Fear Factor\" have demanded stunts which violate the association's guidelines.\n\nAmerican Humane believes that shows like \"Fear Factor\" are on a slippery slope of animal mistreatment and provide poor examples of animal treatment and humane ethics. As we work diligently to expand voluntary compliance with animal safety guidelines, organisations like Endemol who blatantly demonstrate complete disregard for animal welfare, or even that of their human contestants — are producing unacceptable programming. Karen Rosa (Communications Manager of AHA Film and TV Unit)\n\nIn January 2005, an episode featuring a stunt involving blended rats aired in its normal prime time slot. Austin Aitken, a part-time paralegal from Cleveland, Ohio, sued NBC for $2.5 million USD for airing the show, claiming that he felt so disgusted from watching the stunt, his blood pressure rose until he felt dizzy and lightheaded and subsequently vomited. He claimed that his disorientation was so severe that he ran into a doorway and seriously injured himself. In March 2005, U.S. District Judge Lesley Wells threw out the lawsuit on the grounds of First Amendment protection.\n\n\"Fear Factor\" was also criticized by major U.S. electrical utilities for an episode that required contestants to climb through a simulated electrical substation with \"electrified wires\" replete with simulated sparks and electrical sounds added in post-processing. The Edison Electric Institute issued a warning regarding the episode, fearing that viewers might attempt to climb through a real substation with potentially fatal results.\n\nAn episode originally scheduled for January 30, 2012, featuring contestants drinking donkey semen and urine, was rejected by NBC, which instead aired a rerun. On January 31, 2012, two of the contestants, twin sisters Claire and Brynne Odioso, appeared on \"The Cowhead Show\" on Tampa Bay radio station WHPT to talk about their experiences in that episode; however, according to TMZ.com, producers of \"Fear Factor\" warned the Odioso sisters not to continue any discussion of the program, as doing so would put them in breach of their confidentiality agreements.\n\n\"Fear Factor\" has also resulted in various spin-off products:\n\n\n"}

His father, Clovis, and his mother, Antonine Paterne, daughter of a native Carib Indian, were both from Guadeloupe, French West Indies. Salvador had a brother, André, and a sister, Alice.\n\nHe began his musical career as a guitarist accompanying other singers. He had learned the guitar by imitating Django Reinhardt's recordings, and was to work alongside him in the 1940s. Salvador recorded several songs written by Boris Vian with Quincy Jones as arranger. He played many years with Ray Ventura and His Collegians where he used to sing, dance and even play comedy on stage.\n\nHe also appeared in movies including \"Nous irons à Monte-Carlo\" (1950), \"Nous irons à Paris\" (Jean Boyer's film of 1949 with the Peters Sisters) and \"Mademoiselle s'amuse\" (1948).\n\nHe is known to have recorded the first French rock and roll songs in 1957 written by Boris Vian and Michel Legrand — \"Rock'n Roll Mops\", \"Rock hoquet, Va t'faire cuire un oeuf, man\" and \"Dis-moi qu'tu m'aimes rock\" — under the artist name of Henry Cording (a play on the word \"Recording\"). Despite this historical aspect, he never ceased to claim that he disliked rock and roll and even refused to talk about this subject later on.\n\nIn the 1960s, Salvador was the host of several popular television variety shows on French TV. In 1964, he scored a hit with \"Zorro est arrivé\", which was inspired by The Coasters' U.S. hit \"Along Came Jones\". He is also famous for his rich, catchy laugh, which is a theme in many of his humorous songs. In 1969, Henri Salvador recorded a variation of \"Mah Nà Mah Nà\" entitled \"Mais non, mais non\" (\"But No, But No\" or \"Of Course Not, Of Course Not\"), with lyrics he had written in French to Piero Umiliani's music.\n\nHenri Salvador and his song \"Dans mon île\" (1957) were thought to be an influence on Antônio Carlos Jobim in formulating the Brazilian bossa nova style.\n\nCaetano Veloso, a famous Brazilian composer and singer, made Henri Salvador famous to Brazilian audiences with the song \"Reconvexo\", in which he says \"quem não sentiu o swing de Henri Salvador?\" (\"who hasn't felt the swing of Henri Salvador?\"). Veloso also recorded a version of Salvador's song \"Dans mon île\".\n\nAt the age of 70, Salvador was the voice-over of the crab Sebastian in the 1989 French dubbing of Disney's \"The Little Mermaid\". Recordings of \"Embrasse-la\" (\"Kiss the Girl\") can be found on YouTube.\n\nSalvador discovered singers Keren Ann and Art Mengo.\n\nHe died of a ruptured aneurysm at his home in the early hours of 13 February 2008. He was 90 years of age. He was buried next to his wife Jacqueline in Père-Lachaise Cemetery.\n\nHe was known as a supporter of Paris Saint-Germain F.C. He obtained four seats for life in the Parc des Princes.\n\nHenri Salvador continues to be popular today among French communities in Canada. In 2000, Virgin Records released a CD featuring popular hits such as \"Jazz Mediterrannée\", which continues to receive regular air play. In 2002, his album \"Chambre avec vue\" sold over two million copies. In 2005, Salvador was awarded the Brazilian Order of Cultural Merit, which he received from the acclaimed singer and Minister of Culture, Gilberto Gil, in the presence of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for his influence on Brazilian culture, particularly on bossa nova, to whose invention he contributed. That same year he took 52nd place in the election of Le Plus Grand Français (The Greatest Frenchman).\n\nHe was also a commander of the French Légion d'honneur and of the French National Order of Merit. In 2007, he released \"Révérence\" on V2 Records, featuring Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso. He then went on to perform the track \"La vie c'est la vie\" from that album on an episode of the BBC programme \"Later… with Jools Holland\" aired on 4 May 2007.\n\n\n\nLast hit single / album \"Chambre avec vue\" (2001)\n"}
{"id": "6732915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6732915", "title": "Hypocatastasis", "text": "Hypocatastasis\n\nHypocatastasis is a figure of speech that declares or implies a resemblance, representation or comparison. It differs from a metaphor, because in a metaphor the two nouns are both named and given; while, in hypocatastasis, only one is named and the other is implied, or as it were, is put down underneath out of sight. Hence hypocatastasis is an implied resemblance or representation: that is an implied simile or metaphor. A hypocatastasis has more force than a metaphor or simile, and expresses as it were a superlative degree of resemblance.\n\nAttribution for the creation of the term is given derisively to a Mr. Lord by G. Bush in 1850. The latter accuses the former of inventing this category of Biblical comparisons which do not seem to fit into the standard categories of metaphor or simile. Since then the term has mostly been confined to analysis of Biblical rhetoric, and it has never migrated to general public usage. It does not appear in the 2009 version of the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nBush says of Lord's term:\nThe Hypocatastasis is the substitution, without a formal notice, of agents and objects of one sphere, or of one species, in the place of the persons or objects of another, as in Is. iii. 15, \"What mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the faces of the poor?\" These acts, says Mr. L., are not literally impracticable, and therefore are not used metaphorically. They are violent and extraordinary, and are employed by \"substitution\", to signify analogous acts of extreme oppression and tyranny. [Italics in original]\n\nBullinger gives the following example: one may say to another, “You are \"like\" a beast.” This would be simile, tamely stating a fact. If, however, he said, “You \"are\" a beast” that would be metaphor. But, if he said simply, “Beast!” that would be hypocatastasis, for the other part of the simile or metaphor (“you”), would be implied and not stated. This figure, therefore, is calculated to arouse the mind and attract and excite the attention to the greatest extent.\n\n"}

{"id": "36324343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36324343", "title": "Koistinen Kantele", "text": "Koistinen Kantele\n\nKoistinen Kantele Ltd. is a manufacturer of kanteles, traditional plucked string instruments of the dulcimer and zither family native to Finland. Located in Rääkkylä, North Karelia, Finland, its current CEO is Hannu Koistinen, and it is a family business. Officially founded in 2000, its history dates back to 1957, when Otto Koistinen built his first kanteles.\n\nThe company makes both acoustic and electric kanteles, and introduced the kantele as a modern instrument and developed high-level kantele amplifying equipment. \n\nThe company's history dates back to 1957, when Otto Koistinen made his first kanteles. Otto's daughter Ritva Koistinen started to play kantele at an early age and demonstrated a high level of musical talent, motivating Otto to build higher quality instruments. Later, Ritva Koistinen became the first traditional playing lecturer in Finland at the Joensuu Music Institute, and in 1987, she founded the solo kantele department at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki. Soon after its establishment, the company became the biggest manufacturer of kanteles and has remained at the top since then.\n\nSon of Otto Koistinen and the brother to Ritva Koistinen, Hannu Koistinen (born 1966) is a developer and designer of many kantele models in the Koistinen Kantele collection. Koistinen's innovations have expanded the image of the kantele, making it suitable for a wider variety of musical styles.\n\nIn 1990-1993, Hannu Koistinen developed the first modern 38-string Concert Kantele model. Based on Paul Salminen's models, the instruments included new lever positions, a fully opening damper, and new string measurements, and which set a new standard of the kantele as a professional instrument.\n\nThe breakthrough was sped up by a double-blind concert kantele test in 1993. The concert was held at a musical instrument building school in Ikaalinen where two of the instruments placed first and second in a group of seven builders and eight kanteles. This further cemented the brand of new kantele models.\n\nBesides Ritva Koistinen, among the many artists playing the Koistinen concert series are Timo Väänänen, Eva Alkula, Eija Kankaanranta, and Senni Eskelinen. Several patents were accepted and instruments featured more innovations like stronger string tension to allow a wider range of dynamics as well as bigger acoustic volume. In 1995, a 39-string was added to the series.\n\nThe next step in the modernization process was the invention of Koistinen Electric 1, the first fully developed 39-string solid-body electric kantele. The instrument was introduced at the 150th anniversary of Kalevala at Helsinki Ice Hockey Hall on 28 February 1999 where Timo Väänänen played it.\n\nThe model offered a player a new range of opportunities as an instrument suitable for a variety of musical styles and as a band instrument that could be used at any size venue. As the Finnish kantele's main features have always been its gentle and sensitive sound, it was necessary to make serious developments in its construction, aiming to get more volume and high quality amplifying. The main change is that two built-in microphones enable the entire range of the instrument to be balanced without altering the genuine sound too much. Another feature is the position in which the instrument had to be played: Instead of being placed on the table with a player sitting, the Electric 1 made to be played while standing. It has its own table that is tilted forward so the audience has a better view of the player's hands and the instrument's strings.\n\nIn 2001 the company introduced the Wing Collection which includes small modern kanteles with five to 15 strings and are in the shape of a pine seed. The models have a colorful design and come equipped with built-in pickups, shoulder straps, and levers.\n\nSince 2000, Koistinen Kantele has grown to a company of ten. This team includes professionals in different areas, and staff from outside Finland. Hedi Viisma on sales is the first chromatic kantele player studying for a Doctorate of Music at Sibelius Academy. Olga Shishkina is the first foreigner who graduated as a Master of Music in Finnish kantele from Sibelius Academy.\n\nIn 2010 Eero Broman became a part owner and a chairman of the Koistinen Kantele board. The same year, Ritva Koistinen became the second kantele artist after Ulla Katajavuori to perform at Carnegie Hall in New York. Today, Koistinen Kantele has several owners including staff and suppliers, as well as the Koistinen family.\n\nIn 2006 the Koistinen Electric 1 was featured in the publication \"Finnish Design Yearbook\" along with Marimekko and Iittala products. On April 21, 2012, the company was awarded the Rantasalmi Prize, a Finnish award in woodworking given by the Finnish Cultural Foundation's South Savolax regional fund. They received the award for the remarkable improvement of the quality, sound, and design of its kantele and raising the image of the national instrument of Finland as a modern and high-quality instrument.\n\n"}

It was established in 1987 and operates under the Gambling Act 2003. Its oldest and most popular draw is the twice-weekly \"Lotto\" draw, which boasts a top prize pool of NZ$1 million. There are a number of other games, including: the four-draws-daily \"Keno\", daily draw of \"Bullseye\", daily draw of \"Play 3\", and a variety of scratchcards known as \"Instant Kiwi\" and \"Instant Play\". Instant Kiwi and Instant Play may only be played by persons 18 years of age or older, under the Gambling Act 2003. \"Powerball\" and \"Lotto Strike\" are optional extras with every Lotto ticket. \n\nProfits from the publicly regulated lotteries are passed to the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board to distribute as funding for recreation, arts, community projects and sports. Since its creation, Lotto NZ has contributed more than $4 billion to the Lottery Grants Board. The New Zealand Film Commission, Creative New Zealand, and Sport New Zealand are major recipients of lottery funding.\n\nThe New Zealand Cabinet approved the creation of Lotto in February 1986, the necessary legislation passing through Parliament in April that year with a 47–20 vote. Lotto NZ was established in June 1987 and the existing Golden Kiwi lottery came under the Commission's authority. The first Lotto draw, with a top prize of $359,808, was held on 1 August 1987.\n\nOver time the range of games were expanded, with Instant Kiwi scratchcards introduced in 1989 (replacing Golden Kiwi), Lotto Strike in 1993, Keno in 1994, Powerball in 2001 and Big Wednesday in 2005. Bullseye introduced in 2009, Play 3 in 2014 and Instant Play in 2017.\n\nLotto has previously been worked into two game shows, \"Telebingo\" and \"Risk\". There were also \"Extra Draws\" on a few occasions in 1998.\n\nIn April 2013 a Lotto advertisement featuring a dog stealing his owner's Lotto ticket because he ditched him for a cat faced a complaint at the Advertising Standards Authority. It was thrown out.\n\n\"All monetary values are in New Zealand dollars.\"\n\nLotto is the most popular of the games with a televised draw on TVNZ 1 at approximately 8:20pm every Wednesday and 8pm every Saturday night. Originally, the draw was aired on TV2 from the first draw screened in August 1987 until July 2015 when it moved to TV One. The first tickets went on sale on 22 July 1987 and the first draw took place on 1 August 1987.\n\nThe televised draw is currently hosted by Sonia Grey and Jordan Vandermade.\n\nIn the main game of Lotto, six balls and one bonus ball are drawn from a Smartplay Halogen II machine containing 40 balls numbered 1 to 40. To win First Division (the top prize), one has to simply mark off all six numbers on the same line.\n\nPlayers can buy Lotto tickets by selecting their own numbers using a coupon, or they can have the machine randomly generate their numbers by purchasing a Lotto Dip. Tickets cost $0.70 per line, with a minimum of four lines if playing with a coupon. The least expensive Lotto Dip is the Basic Lucky Dip, which costs $5.60 for eight lines.\n\n\nIn 1998, there were several Extra Draws during the year. They worked as follows:\n\nBetween November 2002 and August 2004, a millionaire was drawn every week from all the Division One winners. Sometimes, more than one millionaire was drawn.\n\nThe rest of the Division One prizes were done as follows:\n\nHowever, if there was only one Division One winner to begin with, they automatically won the million, and if nobody matched all six numbers, which only happened once, the millionaire was selected from Division Two.\n\nIntroduced 3 April 1993.\n\nA Lotto player may, at a cost of $1, add to their ticket four Lotto Strike numbers. The objective is to match these numbers, in exact order, with the first four numbers of the Lotto draw.\n\nThe current minimum jackpot for the \"Strike 4\" prize is $100,000, and increases by that amount until won, or until the jackpot reaches $700,000 or the tenth draw without a winner.\n\nIntroduced February 2001.\n\nA line may be \"enhanced\" by the purchase of a Powerball number. If Powerball is played, a minimum of four Powerball numbers must be purchased per ticket, at the cost of $0.80 per line. The Powerball number is a number between 1 and 10, drawn from a separate machine from the main Lotto draw. If the winning Powerball number is on the same line as a winning line of Lotto, the ticket holder wins a share of the Powerball prize pool in addition to the prize won from the main Lotto draw.\n\nTo win first division Powerball, the winner must first win Lotto first division, and have the winning Powerball number on the same line. The prize for first division is very large: a minimum of $4 million, but with the chances of winning one-tenth of the odds of winning an equivalent prize in the main draw. Since April 2017 Powerball First Division can jackpot to a maximum of $50 million. Once the limit is met or passed, a \"Must Be Won\" draw must be held in which, if First Division is not won, the First Division jackpot must be split amongst the winners of the next highest division for which there are winners.\n\nWhen introduced, the Powerball number was originally drawn from eight numbers, and the minimum prize was $1 million. The maximum jackpot, which initially was $15 million, was gradually raised to $30 million. In October 2007, Powerball was changed to ten numbers and the minimum prize was changed to $3 million. On 3 October 2010, the price per line was raised from $0.50 to $0.60, to cover the cost of the rise in GST from 12.5% to 15%, and to increase the minimum prize to $4 million. In October 2015, Division 7 was introduced and the maximum jackpot increased from $30 million to $40 million. In April 2017, the price per line changed from $0.60 to $0.80.\n\nStarting from the 30 May 2018 draw, Powerball is drawn with one of two Smartplay Halogen II machines. From introduction until the 26 May 2018 draw, it was drawn with one of two Ryo Catteau Mimosa machines. The balls were introduced and the winning number captured and presented through a clear vertical tube in the centre of the machine. On several occasions, the machine has been known to fail to draw a number on-air, resulting in the Powerball number having to be re-drawn off-air under auditor scrutiny. These include:\n\n\nIntroduced August 2004.\n\nEvery Lotto ticket has a 16-digit Winning Wheel number (e.g. 123-45678901-20XX) which is the same as the ticket's serial number, except that the two digit checksum is replaced with XX for security reasons. Every draw, a serial number is drawn at random. The winner is awarded an all expenses paid trip to the studio in Auckland where they appear on the show and spin the eponymous wheel to determine their prize.\n\nThe two-metre diameter wheel has 30 segments, each segment carrying either a cash prize ranging from $100,000 to $1 million, or non-cash prizes such as cars, shopping sprees and a $500,000 house and land package.\n\nIf someone does not wish to appear on the Winning Wheel, they may nominate a person to spin the wheel on their behalf, or they may take the minimum guaranteed prize of $25,000.\n\nEntry into the draw for the Winning Wheel is automatic for all Lotto and Lotto Powerball tickets. Lotto Strike tickets are excluded, as they have a serial number ending in 12XX, not 20XX.\n\nThe Winning Wheel ended on July 4, 2015.\n\nFollowing the format of the popular bingo hall game, Keno draws are made daily at 10am, 1pm, 3pm and 6pm. Tickets cost between $1 and $100 per line. The top prize for matching 10 numbers from 10 is $250,000 for a $1 wager, with a maximum prize of $1 million available.\n\nBullseye is a daily lottery game, launched on 19 October 2009. The winning number is drawn at 6pm and results are available online and in-store at 6:10pm.\n\nOne selects a six-digit number between 000000 and 999999, or gets the Lotto terminal to randomly select a number, and the aim is to get as close as possible to the Bullseye number. Tickets are $2 each number for one day, and $10 for one number for seven days. If one matches the Bullseye number exactly, they win first division and the top prize of a minimum $100,000. The first division jackpot has a maximum threshold of $400,000. If this threshold is reached, the next game will be a \"must be won\" draw; if no one wins the first division, the jackpot will go to the winners in the next highest division. Lesser prizes are won if one's number is up to 50,000 either side of the Bullseye, with prizes increasing in value as one's number gets closer to the Bullseye number. For the purposes of winning, the numbers are viewed as circular, with 999999 followed by 000000 (e.g. if the winning number was 975555, the winning range would be 925555 to 025555).\n\nInstant Kiwi is Lotto NZ's series of scratchcards. Introduced in 1989 to replace the Golden Kiwi, Instant Kiwi has evolved over 21 years to its current format of four ticket groups and five price levels. It is one of two Lotto NZ games with a purchase age restriction and minor prize claim age restriction – it is illegal to sell Instant Kiwi tickets to those under 18 years of age.\n\nFrom mid-2010, tickets are broken up into four major groups:\n\nThere are five pricing levels, with the higher-priced levels having larger prizes. The price-to-prize structure is same across all games.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, Instant Kiwi introduced a 2nd Chance draw where players could win $1,000 cash with non-winning Instant Kiwi tickets.\n\nIntroduced October 2014.\n\nPlay 3 is Lotto NZ's third daily game with the first draw on 6 October 2014. Draws take place at 6pm. Players can select a 3 digit number between 000 and 999 and a play type on a coupon or they can have the computer randomly select their number and play type by marking the random number box on the coupon or by asking the Lotto shop for a Dip. Draws are held at 6pm every day. Players can win larger prizes by playing a multi play type for $2, $3, and $6.\n\nIntroduced on 4 December 2017.\n\nInstant Play is the digital version of Instant Kiwi, which was introduced on MyLotto.co.nz on Monday 4 December 2017. All games cost from $0.50 to $5.00 with top prizes ranging from $4,000 to $100,000. Players can either try or purchase a game for Instant Play. Same as Instant Kiwi, players will have to be 18+ to play.\n\nTelebingo ran from February 1996 to June 2001. There were two components, a lottery and a game show. The original timeslot was on TV ONE at 8 pm on a Wednesday, but later in its run, it was moved around. In late 1999, Telebingo was also re-aired at 3:30 pm the next day. The hosts were Simon Barnett and Ingrid Mole. Barnett was later replaced by Grant Walker.\n\nBetween 34 and 75 numbers were drawn from 75. Viewers at home had to match the numbers on-screen with numbers on a mini bingo board. These could be purchased at $2 each for a minimum of two tickets. There were three divisions:\n\nIf there were no winners in a division, the respective prize pool was carried over to the next division.\n\nThree contestants appeared on the show. They started with $125 and a corner square, they earned $25 and another corner square for every question right and lost $25 (but not their corner square) for every question wrong. At the Cross round, they were given two squares as a head-start towards Cross. After Cross was earned, random squares were given with every correct answer until either a viewer or a contestant got Bingo. There were two possible outcomes as to the end:\n\nThe contestant with the most money then went to a memory board, where he or she had to reveal two matching squares to get a certain prize, and then he or she had the option of taking away the prizes or risking them for more the next week.\n\nRisk ran from July 2001 to February 2002. Draw numbers started from where Telebingo numbers left off. The show was on TV ONE in a more consistent time slot, at 7:30 pm on a Wednesday. The show was hosted by Jon Bridges.\n\nTwenty-five numbers from 1 to 90 were drawn. The objective was to match one of the following:\n\nAll panels except Game 'R' had one or more $ signs which could be marked off immediately. A number could appear on two panels on a single ticket.\n\nThe game-board looked like this:\n\nGame 'R' jackpotted if not won.\n\nThere was a team colour printed on each ticket. If that team won, then all tickets bearing that colour went into a draw for a cash prize.\n\nThree teams of two contestants (namely Red, Yellow and Purple) were spotted $500 ($300 in the first few episodes) to begin the game with. Correct answers were worth $50, and incorrect answers were penalized by that amount. After two rounds, the team in third place was eliminated, and at the end of the last round, only one team prevailed.\n\nThe Big Wednesday draw was introduced in October 2005, and was televised on TVNZ 1 each Wednesday, at approximately 8:20 pm. Offering substantial non-cash prizes, such as luxury cars, atop a significant cash prize (minimum value of $3.5 million), it was marketed as an opportunity to win \"the ultimate lifestyle\". Lines were $1 each, with (like the main Lotto game) a minimum of four lines per ticket.\n\nThe mechanism of the draw was similar to Lotto, with players trying to correctly guess the six numbers drawn. However, there were 50 balls for Big Wednesday, not 40, and the game had the added feature of a \"coin toss\"; along with the numbers, players must predict heads or tails. A player matching all six numbers will only win the jackpot if they correctly guess the outcome of the coin toss. The odds on winning the jackpot were 1 in 31,781,400. However, if the player did not match the coin toss, they would win Second Division, which consisted of a smaller jackpotting cash prize.\n\nAs with Lotto, players could also have their numbers selected for them by the machine by purchasing a Big Wednesday \"Dip\". The Basic Big Wednesday Dip cost $6.00. Players could opt to select either heads, tails or random heads/tails. A popular option was a Big Wednesday Dip with both heads and tails, which produced two tickets with the same numbers, one ticket with \"heads\" on all line and one ticket with \"tails\" on all lines, which ensured that if the player matched all the numbers, they would win both First and Second Division.\n\nEffective from the draw on 14 September 2011, the number of balls was increased from 45 to 50, lengthening the Division 1 (and 2) odds to 1 in 31,781,400. The Division 5 prize (for three correct numbers, previously winning a Lucky Dip entry) was split into new Division 5 for a matched coin toss, now winning a cash prize, and Division 6 for an incorrect coin toss prediction, winning a four-line Lucky Dip entry.\n\nBig Wednesday ended on 30 September 2015, with a Must Be Won draw.\n\nThe original format of Big Wednesday saw the first draw's jackpot consist of $2 million cash and two luxury cars. If not won, non-cash prizes were added to the jackpot for the next four weeks, after which the cash component then increased until the jackpot reached a combined cash value of $30 million. At this point, a \"Must Be Won\" draw would be held, with the jackpot divided amongst lower division winners if Division 1 was not won.\n\nSome of the \"non-cash\" prizes – namely, the travel and bach components – were paid as cash (via cheque or direct credit); the other prizes could be paid as cash at Lotto NZ's discretion, including:\n\n\nEffective 14 September 2011, the jackpot prize was changed so all of the non-cash prizes are made available from the first draw in a jackpot sequence (although with some of the \"non-cash\" prizes reduced in value). The advertised \"cash\" component then increased with every jackpot draw until won (or the $30 million \"Must Be Won\" threshold is reached). The minimum jackpot prize consisted as follows:\n\n\nOn 26 May 2008 Lotto NZ launched MyLotto, an online sales channel providing an alternative to the traditional retail outlet for players of Lotto, Keno, Bullseye and Play 3. Instant Kiwi products are not available on MyLotto. Players must register to use the service, and add funds to their account via internet banking or credit card before purchasing tickets. There is a maximum spending limit of $150 a week or $500 a month; players can choose a lower spending limit if they wish, and can block themselves from participation in any of the games. MyLotto operates between 6.30 am and 11 pm Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday, and between 6.30 am and midnight on Wednesday and Saturday.\nAs with tickets purchased at retail outlets, players have the options of playing a Dip, selecting their own numbers and players can save their favourite numbers for future use.\nAdditionally, players can choose a subscription to play weekly.\n\nBonus tickets and cash prizes up to and including $1,000 can be claimed at any Lotto outlet by presenting and surrendering the ticket, and the prize is paid out from the terminal.\n\nAll non-cash prizes and cash prizes over $1,000 can be claimed at any Lotto outlet by presenting and surrendering the ticket. The bearer must complete a Prize Claim form, which is sent along with the ticket to Lotto NZ in Auckland for the claim of the prize.\n\nWinners of large prizes often bypass the Lotto outlet and go straight to Lotto NZ's head office in Auckland. Claiming prizes over $5,000 and special draw prizes cause the processing Lotto terminal to lock for security reasons, and the terminal operator must call Lotto NZ to unlock the terminal, giving Lotto NZ staff a chance to talk to the winners.\n\nPrizes must be claimed within 12 months of the draw (or close of the game for Instant Kiwi), otherwise the prize is void and the unclaimed money goes back into the prize pool.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "375199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=375199", "title": "Love and Rockets (comics)", "text": "Love and Rockets (comics)\n\nLove and Rockets (often abbreviated L&R) is a comic book series by the Hernandez brothers: Gilbert, Jaime, and Mario. It was one of the first comic books in the alternative comics movement of the 1980s.\n\nThe Hernandez brothers produced stories in the series independently of each other. Gilbert and Jaime produced the majority of the material, and tended to focus on particular casts of characters and settings. Those of Gilbert usually focused on a cast of characters in the fictional Central American village of Palomar; the stories often featured magic realist elements. The \"Locas\" stories of Jaime centered on a social group in Los Angeles, particularly the Latin-American friends and sometimes-lovers Maggie and Hopey.\n\nThe brothers Gilbert, Jaime, and Mario Hernandez self-published the first issue of \"Love and Rockets\" in 1981. In 1982, Fantagraphics Books republished this issue with a color cover. The series was published at magazine size, larger than typical American comic books. Either Gilbert or Jaime, the series' main contributors, would provide the front cover for a given issue, and the other the back; they alternated these duties each issue. The first volume ended with the 50th issue in 1996. The second volume ran for twenty issues from 2001 to 2007 in standard US comic book size. A third series began in 2008, published annually in 100-page, graphic novel-sized issues. In 2016, the series returned to its original, magazine-sized format.\n\nThe Hernandez brothers self-published the first issue of \"Love and Rockets\" in 1981, but since 1982 it has been published by Fantagraphics Books. The magazine temporarily ceased publication in 1996 after the release of issue #50, while Gilbert and Jaime went on to do separate series involving many of the same characters. However, in 2001 \"Los Bros Hernandez\" (as they are often referred to) revived the series as \"Love and Rockets\" Volume 2.\n\n\"Love and Rockets\" contains several ongoing serial narratives, the most prominent being Gilbert's \"Palomar\" stories and Jaime's \"Hoppers 13\" (aka \"Locas\") stories. It also contains one-offs, shorter stories, surrealist jokes, and more.\n\n\"Palomar\" tells the story of a fictional village in Latin America and its inhabitants. Its vibrant characters and sometimes-fantastic events are sometimes compared to the magical realism literary style of authors such as Gabriel García Márquez. The series is also sometimes referred to as \"Heartbreak Soup\", after the first story set in Palomar.\n\"Hoppers 13\" follows the tangled lives of a group of primarily chicano characters, from their teenage years in the early days of the California punk scene to the present day. (Hoppers, or Huerta, is a fictional city based on the Hernandezes' home town of Oxnard, California.) Two memorable members of Jaime's cast are Margarita Luisa \"Maggie\" Chascarrillo and Esperanza \"Hopey\" Leticia Glass, whose on-again, off-again romance is a focus for many \"Hoppers 13\" storylines. The series is also often called \"Locas\" (Spanish for \"crazy women\") because of the many quirky female characters depicted.\n\nOne aspect of the \"Love and Rockets\" opus is the way Los Bros Hernandez portray the passage of time in a relatively realistic manner despite the traditional constraints of the medium. For example, Maggie's character, a mechanic, debuted as a slight yet curvy young adult living in a world both distinctly chicano and punk with a sci-fi twist. As Jaime developed her character in more detail, she started to gain weight slowly. Over the years, Maggie and the other characters have evolved, growing more layered and complex as their stories develop. The present Maggie, who now wears her hair bleached blonde and has a penchant for wearing sexy bathing suits on her rubenesque figure, is the manager of an apartment complex. Jaime has also made extensive use of flashbacks, with Maggie and the others presented at different ages from toddlers through teenagers and young adults to thirtysomethings. The first issue of volume two of \"Love and Rockets\" featured a cover with a range of different Maggie ages/looks.\n\nThe original runs of \"Palomar\" and \"Locas\" have each been collected in recent one-volume editions by Fantagraphics (see Palomar (graphic novel)), although not all of the stories involving \"Locas\" and \"Palomar\" characters are contained in these collections. The original fifty-issue \"Love and Rockets Volume One\" has also been reprinted in its entirety in both a fifteen-volume paperback library, and more recently a seven-volume mass-market paperback series by Fantagraphics. In addition, several hardcovers collect edited versions of the series tales.\n\nMany attempts have been made to make L&R into a movie, or series of movies. However, until recently, the movie rights had been held up in litigation for over 15 years. On May 10, 2013 Gilbert Hernandez publicly announced in Toronto, Ontario that a deal had been struck to make a movie out of his \"Palomar\" story-line and that he was currently writing the script.\n\n\n\nThis list provides an example of the types of stories that helped \"Love and Rockets\" gain critical acclaim.\n\n\n\nAll published at Fantagraphics :\n\nVolume 1 was re-released in smaller \"omnibus\" style trade paperbacks. Starting in 2010, volume 2's stories began getting re-releases as well. In 2018, the New Stories began being collected among the \"omnibus\" paperbacks.\n\nEdited segments of both the Palomar and the Maggie stories are available in hardcover format.\n\nThe series continues in annual trade paperbacks, entitled \"Love & Rockets: New Stories\". To date, eight exist:\n\nIn 2012, Jaime Hernandez's individual stories from the first two volumes of \"New Stories\" were collected into a single volume, entitled \"God and Science: Return of the Ti-Girls\", which also included about 30 new pages of comics.\n\nIn 2014, Jaime Hernandez's stories from volumes 3 and 4 of \"New Stories\" were collected into a single volume entitled \"The Love Bunglers.\"\n\nIn 2016, Fantagraphics began releasing Volume IV of Love and Rockets.\n\n"}

It recounts his journey from a young, impoverished village boy destined to labor in the fields of China to a world-famous professional dancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n(see \"niáng\" on Wiktionary)\n\n\n\n\nLi Cunxin is born into a poor family commune in a small rural village in Shandong Province, where he is destined to work in the fields as a labourer. At first overlooked but selected after a suggestion by his teacher during a school visit, Li seems bewildered by the gruff preliminary inspection screening at the provincial capital city of Qingdao. Selected to travel to Beijing to audition for a place in Madame Mao's Dance Academy, he is admitted to its ballet school after passing a series of physical tests.\n\nSeven years of arduous training follow. He struggles at the academy, failing to excel as he tries to cope with his homesickness. There is no freedom within the rigid schedule, where he must balance hours and hours of dance classes along with strenuous academic classes. He also campaigns to be part of the Communist youth party, surviving rigorous interviews; after he is let in, an additional portion of his time is given to meetings. But Cunxin doesn't mind; he has a calling now: serving glorious Communism. The arrival of a new teacher, this one less likely to shout, changes his grim outlook on dance. He puts more emphasis on having fun and on knowing strengths and weaknesses. Teacher Xiao keeps an eye on Cunxin, spotting something other teachers hadn't yet seen. The teacher also (dangerously) differs from others at the academy because of his devotion to classical ballet, considered too Western to be taught at the school (as opposed to the politically motivated, strident form favoured by Madame Mao). His determination and courage, paired with Teacher Xiao's advice and motivation allows him to be the top of the class, offered more and more roles. This leads to him being grudgingly permitted by the Academy to travel abroad to Ben Stevenson's Houston Ballet company as a visiting student for six weeks as the government has slightly slackened its censorship of Western culture due to upheavals in position.\n\nIn the United States, he begins to question the Chinese Communist Party dictates upon which he has been raised. America is not filled with filthy-looking capitalists, and the sheer wealth and size of the buildings and the people clearly indicate that China is the poverty stricken country, not America. However, he knows this sentiment is too dangerous to be spoken, and upon return to China, even though he loved every bit of America, he tones it down and recites some Communist propaganda for the report to be filed so he can return in two months time. However, despite the lies, the government refuses to let him return to the U.S. Three months later, he manages to get his visa and goes—this time for a full year dancing in the Houston Ballet. He starts a secret romance with aspiring American dancer, Elizabeth Mackey, keeping it a secret so his government doesn't find out and send him back. He is quickly promoted to soloist position and allowed five more months. In the last month, Cunxin is reluctant to leave, so he and Elizabeth rush their marriage so that Cunxin can remain in the United States indefinitely, thus avoiding a defection which may have consequences for his family. Visiting the Chinese Consulate to announce his decision while trying to prevent the sure backlash on Stevenson, the resident Chinese diplomat forcibly detains Li in attempt to coerce his return to China; when he continues to refuse to go willingly, the Party agrees to release and allow him to stay, but revokes his citizenship and declares he can never return to the land of his birth. Full of concern for his family, Cunxin continues to dance, but his relationship with Elizabeth ends in divorce, and he cites his youth and cultural differences as the reason.\n\nCunxin is quickly promoted to principal dancer status, making numerous premieres and winning awards, but severely injured his back, putting him out of commission for over two months. Despite the setback, he continues dancing, and soon after, the Chinese government allowed his parents to come to America to visit him after six years of being cut off from his family. They arrive to watch him in the Nutcracker, and sob as they reunite, and the audience gives a standing ovation. Li meets and marries Australian ballerina Mary McKendry, and they finally go back to his old village. Cunxin meets with his old Teacher Xiao, and performs for him and his parents, but feels an inexplicable amount of guilt for the huge difference in how he lives and how the rest of the village lives, but consoles himself in thinking that he has fulfilled all his mother ever wanted for him. They return to America and continue dancing.\n\nSophie, Cunxin and Mary's first child, is born profoundly deaf, to their devastation. Mary gives up her career to take care of her, and Sophie has led a normal life because of it, also taking dance classes in following in her parents footsteps. They go on to have two more children, perfectly healthy, but decide to move to Mary's home country, Australia. Their farewell performance, Romeo and Juliet, is broadcast live throughout China to five hundred million viewers. In Australia, he keeps dancing, but also gets a job managing one of the largest stock brokerage firms in Australia. He continues to visit his mother and his village, never forgetting where he came from.\n\n"}
{"id": "240761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=240761", "title": "Music of Cuba", "text": "Music of Cuba\n\nThe music of Cuba, including its instruments, performance and dance, comprises a large set of unique traditions influenced mostly by west African and European (especially Spanish) music. Due to the syncretic nature of most of its genres, Cuban music is often considered one of the richest and most influential regional musics of the world. For instance, the son cubano merges an adapted Spanish guitar (tres), melody, harmony, and lyrical traditions with Afro-Cuban percussion and rhythms. Almost nothing remains of the original native traditions, since the native population was exterminated in the 16th century.\n\nSince the 19th century Cuban music has been hugely popular and influential throughout the world. It has been perhaps the most popular form of regional music since the introduction of recording technology. Cuban music has contributed to the development of a wide variety of genre and musical styles around the globe, most notably in Latin America, the Caribbean, West Africa and Europe. Examples include rhumba, Afro-Cuban jazz, salsa, soukous, many West African re-adaptations of Afro-Cuban music (Orchestra Baobab, Africando), Spanish fusion genres (notably with flamenco), and a wide variety of genres in Latin America.\n\nLarge numbers of African slaves and European, mostly Spanish, immigrants came to Cuba and brought their own forms of music to the island. European dances and folk musics included zapateo, fandango, paso doble and retambico. Later, northern European forms like minuet, gavotte, mazurka, contradanza, and the waltz appeared among urban whites. There was also an immigration of Chinese indentured laborers later in the 19th century.\n\nFernando Ortiz, the first great Cuban folklorist, described Cuba's musical innovations as arising from the interplay ('transculturation') between African slaves settled on large sugar plantations and Spaniards from different regions such as Andalusia and Canary Islands. The African slaves and their descendants made many percussion instruments and preserved rhythms they had known in their homeland. The most important instruments were the drums, of which there were originally about fifty different types; today only the bongos, congas and batá drums are regularly seen (the timbales are descended from kettle drums in Spanish military bands). Also important are the claves, two short hardwood batons, and the cajón, a wooden box, originally made from crates. Claves are still used often, and wooden boxes (\"cajones\") were widely used during periods when the drum was banned. In addition, there are other percussion instruments in use for African-origin religious ceremonies. Chinese immigrants contributed the \"corneta china\" (Chinese cornet), a Chinese reed instrument still played in the comparsas, or carnival groups, of Santiago de Cuba.\n\nThe great instrumental contribution of the Spanish was their guitar, but even more important was the tradition of European musical notation and techniques of musical composition. Hernando de la Parra's archives give some of our earliest available information on Cuban music. He reported instruments including the clarinet, violin and vihuela. There were few professional musicians at the time, and fewer still of their songs survive. One of the earliest is \"Ma Teodora\", supposed to be related to a freed slave, Teodora Ginés of Santiago de Cuba, who was famous for her compositions. The piece is said to be similar to 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century Spanish popular songs and dances.\n\nCuban music has its principal roots in Spain and West Africa, but over time has been influenced by diverse genres from different countries. Important among these are France (and its colonies in the Americas), and the United States.\n\nCuban music has been immensely influential in other countries. It contributed not only to the development of jazz and salsa, but also to the Argentine tango, Ghanaian high-life, West African Afrobeat, Dominican Bachata and Merengue, Colombian Cumbia and Spanish Nuevo flamenco and to the Arabo-Cuban music (Hanine Y Son Cubano) developed by Michel Elefteriades in the 1990s.\n\nThe African beliefs and practices certainly influenced Cuba's music. Polyrhythmic percussion is an inherent part of African music, as melody is part of European music. Also, in African tradition, percussion is always joined to song and dance, and to a particular social setting. The result of the meeting of European and African cultures is that most Cuban popular music is creolized. This creolization of Cuban life has been happening for a long time, and by the 20th century, elements of African belief, music and dance were well integrated into popular and folk forms.\n\nAmong internationally heralded composers of the \"serious\" genre can be counted the Baroque composer Esteban Salas y Castro (1725–1803), who spent much of his life teaching and writing music for the Church. He was followed in the Cathedral of Santiago de Cuba by the priest Juan París (1759–1845). París was an exceptionally industrious man, and an important composer. He encouraged continuous and diverse musical events. Aside from rural music and Afro-Cuban folk music, the most popular kind of urban Creole dance music in the 19th century was the contradanza, which commenced as a local form of the English country dance and the derivative French contredanse and Spanish contradanza. While many contradanzas were written for dance, from the mid-century several were written as light-classical parlor pieces for piano. The first distinguished composer in this style was Manuel Saumell (1818–1870), who is sometimes accordingly hailed as the father of Cuban creole musical development. According to Helio Orovio, \"After Saumell's visionary work, all that was left to do was to develop his innovations, all of which profoundly influenced the history of Cuban nationalist musical movements.\"\nIn the hands of his successor, Ignacio Cervantes Kawanagh, the piano idiom related to the contradanza achieved even greater sophistication. Cervantes was called by Aaron Copland a \"Cuban Chopin\" because of his Chopinesque piano compositions. Cervantes' reputation today rests almost solely upon his famous forty-one \"Danzas Cubanas\", which Carpentier said, \"...occupy the place that the \"Norwegian Dances\" of Grieg or the \"Slavic Dances\" of Dvořák occupy in the musics of their respective countries\". Cervantes' never-finished opera, \"Maledetto\", is forgotten.\n\nIn the 1840s, the habanera emerged as a languid vocal song using the contradanza rhythm. (Non-Cubans sometimes called Cuban contradanzas \"habaneras.\") The habanera went on to become popular in Spain and elsewhere. The Cuban contradanza/danza was also an important influence on the Puerto Rican danza, which went on to enjoy its own dynamic and distinctive career lasting through the 1930s. In Cuba, in the 1880s the contradanza/danza gave birth to the danzón, which effectively superseded it in popularity.\n\nLaureano Fuentes (1825–1898) came from a family of musicians and wrote the first opera to be composed on the island, \"La hija de Jefté\" (Jefte's daughter). This was later lengthened and staged under the title \"Seila\". His numerous works spanned all genres. Gaspar Villate (1851–1891) produced abundant and wide-ranging work, all centered on opera. José White (1836–1918), a mulatto of a Spanish father and an Afrocuban mother, was a composer and a violinist of international merit. He learned to play sixteen instruments, and lived, variously, in Cuba, Latin America and Paris. His most famous work is \"La bella cubana\", a habanera.\nDuring the middle years of the 19th century, a young American musician came to Havana: Louis Moreau Gottschalk (1829–1869), whose father was a Jewish businessman from London, and his mother a white creole of French Catholic background. Gottschalk was brought up mostly by his black grandmother and nurse Sally, both from Saint-Domingue. He was a piano prodigy who had listened to the music and seen the dancing in Congo Square, New Orleans from childhood. His period in Cuba lasted from 1853 to 1862, with visits to Puerto Rico and Martinique squeezed in. He composed many creolized pieces, such as the habanera \"Bamboula, Op. 2\" (Danse de negres) (1845), the title referring to a bass Afro-Caribbean drum; \"El cocoye\" (1853), a version of a rhythmic melody already present in Cuba; the contradanza \"Ojos criollos (Danse cubaine)\" (1859) and a version of \"María de la O\", which refers to a Cuban mulatto singer. These numbers made use of typical Cuban rhythmic patterns. At one of his farewell concerts he played his \"Adiós a Cuba\" to huge applause and shouts of 'bravo!' Unfortunately, his score for the work has not survived. In February 1860 Gottschalk produced a huge work \"La nuit des tropiques\" in Havana. The work used about 250 musicians and a choir of 200 singers plus a tumba francesa group from Santiago de Cuba. He produced another huge concert the following year, with new material. These shows probably dwarfed anything seen in the island before or since, and no doubt were unforgettable for those who attended.\n\n\"Amadeo Roldán (1900–1939) and Alejandro García Caturla (1906–1940) were Cuba's symphonic revolutionaries [though] their music is rarely played today\". They both played a part in Afrocubanismo: the movement in black-themed Cuban culture with origins in the 1920s, and extensively analysed by Fernando Ortiz. Roldan, born in Paris to a Cuban mulatta and a Spanish father, came to Cuba in 1919 and became the concert-master (first-chair violin) of the new \"Orquesta Sinfónica de La Habana\" in 1922. There he met Caturla, at sixteen a second violin. Roldan's compositions included \"Overture on Cuban themes\" (1925), and two ballets: \"La Rebambaramba\" (1928) and \"El milagro de Anaquille\" (1929). There followed a series of \"Ritmicas\" and \"Poema negra\" (1930) and \"Tres toques\" (march, rites, dance) (1931). In \"Motivos de son\" (1934) he wrote eight pieces for voice and instruments based on the poet Nicolás Guillén's set of poems with the same title. His last composition was two \"Piezas infantiles\" for piano (1937). Roldan died young, at 38, of a disfiguring facial cancer (he had been an inveterate smoker).\n\nAfter his student days, Caturla lived all his life in the small central town of Remedios, where he became a lawyer to support his growing family. His \"Tres danzas cubanas\" for symphony orchestra was first performed in Spain in 1929. \"Bembe\" was premiered in Havana the same year. His \"Obertura cubana\" won first prize in a national contest in 1938. Caturla was murdered at 34 by a young gambler.\n\nGonzalo Roig (1890–1970), was a major force in the first half of the century. A composer and orchestral director, he qualified in piano, violin and composition theory. In 1922 he was one of the founders of the National Symphony Orchestra, which he conducted. In 1927 he was appointed Director of the Havana School of Music. As a composer he specialized in the zarzuela, a musical theatre form, very popular up to World War II. In 1931 he co-founded a \"bufo\" company (comic theatre) at the Marti Theatre in Havana. He was the composer of the most well-known Cuban zarzuela, \"Cecilia Valdés\", based on the famous 19th-century novel about a Cuban mulata. It was premiered in 1932. He founded various organizations and wrote frequently on musical topics.\n\nOne of the greatest Cuban pianist/composers of the 20th century was Ernesto Lecuona (1895–1963). Lecuona composed over six hundred pieces, mostly in the Cuban vein, and was a pianist of exceptional quality. He was a prolific composer of songs and music for stage and film. His works consisted of zarzuela, Afro-Cuban and Cuban rhythms, suites and many songs that became Latin standards. They include \"Siboney\", \"Malagueña\" and \"The Breeze And I\" (\"Andalucía\"). In 1942 his great hit \"Always in my heart\" (\"Siempre en mi Corazon\") was nominated for an Oscar for Best Song; it lost out to \"White Christmas\". The Ernesto Lecuona Symphonic Orchestra performed the premiere of Lecuona's \"Black Rhapsody\" in the Cuban Liberation Day Concert at Carnegie Hall on 10 October 1943.\n\nFounded in 1942 under the guidance of José Ardévol (1911–1981), a Catalan composer established in Cuba since 1930, the \"Grupo de Renovación Musical\" served as a platform for a group of young composers to develop a proactive movement with the purpose of improving and literally renovating the quality of the Cuban musical environment. During its existence from 1942 to 1948, the group organized numerous concerts at the Havana Lyceum in order to present their avant-garde compositions to the general public and fostered within its members the development of many future conductors, art critics, performers and professors. They also started a process of investigation and reevaluation of the Cuban music in general, discovering the outstanding work of Carlo Borbolla and promoting the compositions of Saumell, Cervantes, Caturla and Roldán. The \"Grupo de Renovación Musical\" included the following composers: Hilario González, Harold Gramatges, Julián Orbón, Juan Antonio Cámara, Serafín Pro, Virginia Fleites, Gisela Hernández, Enrique Aparicio Bellver, Argeliers León, Dolores Torres and Edgardo Martín. Other contemporary Cuban composers that were little or no related at all to the \"Groupo de Renovación Musical\" were: Aurelio de la Vega, Joaquín Nin-Culmell, Alfredo Diez Nieto and Natalio Galán.\n\nAlthough, in Cuba, many composers have written both classical and popular creole types of music, the distinction became clearer after 1960, when (at least initially) the regime frowned on popular music and closed most of the night-club venues, whilst providing financial support for classical music rather than creole forms. From then on most musicians have kept their careers on one side of the invisible line or the other. After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, a new crop of classical musicians came onto the scene. The most important of these is guitarist Leo Brouwer, who made significant innovations in classical guitar, and is currently the director of the \"Havana Symphonic Orchestra\". His directorship in the early 1970s of the Cuban Institute of Instrumental and Cinematographic Arts (ICAIC) was instrumental in the formation and consolidation of the nueva trova movement.\n\nOther important composers from the early post-revolution period that began in 1959 were: Carlos Fariñas and Juan Blanco, a pioneer of \"concrete\" and \"electroacoustic music\" in Cuba.\nClosely following the early post-revolution generation, a group of young composers started to attract the attention of the public that attended classical music concerts. Most of them had obtained degrees in reputable Schools outside the country thanks to scholarships granted by the government, like Sergio Fernández Barroso (also known as Sergio Barroso), that received a post-graduate degree from the Superior Academy of Music in Prague, and Roberto Valera, who studied with Witold Rudziński and Andrzej Dobrowolski in Poland. Three other composers belong to this group: Calixto Alvarez, Carlos Malcolm and Hector Angulo.\n\nDuring the early 1970s, a group of musicians and composers, most of them graduated from the National School of Arts and the Havana Conservatory, gathered around an organization recently created by the government as the junior section of UNEAC (National Writers and Artist's Union of Cuba), the \"Brigada Hermanos Saíz.\" Some of its member were composers Juan Piñera (nephew of the renowned Cuban writer Virgilio Piñera), Flores Chaviano, Armando Rodriguez Ruidiaz, Danilo Avilés, Magaly Ruiz and Efraín Amador Piñero. Other contemporary composers less involved with the organization were José María Vitier, Julio Roloff, Jorge López Marín and José Loyola.\nAfter the Cuban Revolution (1959), many future Cuban composers emigrated at a very young age and developed most of their careers outside the country. Within this group are the composers Tania León, Orlando Jacinto García, Armando Tranquilino, Odaline de la Martinez, José Raul Bernardo, Jorge Martín (composer) and Raul Murciano.\n\nDuring the last decades of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century a new generation of composers emerged into the Cuban classical music panorama. Most of them received a solid musical education provided by the official arts school system created by the Cuban government and graduated from the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA). Some of those composers are Louis Franz Aguirre, Ileana Pérez Velázquez, Keila María Orozco, Viviana Ruiz, Fernando (Archi) Rodríguez Alpízar, Yalil Guerra, Eduardo Morales Caso, Ailem Carvajal Gomez., Irina Escalante Chernova. and Evelin Ramón. All of them have emigrated and currently live and work in other countries.\n\nJuan Blanco was the first Cuban composer to create an electroacoustic piece in 1961. This first composition, titled \"Musica Para Danza\", was produced with just an oscillator and three common tape recorders. As a result of the enormous scarcity generated by the Cuban Revolution since its origins in 1959, access to the necessary technological resources to produce electroacoustic music was always very limited for anyone interested. For this reason, it was not until 1969 that another Cuban composer, Sergio Barroso, dedicated himself to the creation of electroacoustic musical compositions.\nIn 1970, Juan Blanco began to work as a music advisor for the Department of Propaganda of ICAP (Insituto Cubano de Amistad con Los Pueblos). In this capacity, he created electroacoustic music for all the audiovisual materials produced by ICAP. After nine years working without restitution, Blanco finally obtained financing to set up an Electroacoustic Studio to be used for his work. He was appointed as Director of the Studio, but under the condition that he should be the only one to use the facility.\n\nAfter a few months, and without asking for permission, he opened the Electroacoustic Studio to all composers interested in working with electroacoustic technology, thus creating the ICAP Electroacoustsic Music Workshop (TIME), where he himself provided training to all participants. In 1990, the ICAP Workshop changed its name to Laboratorio Nacional de Música Electroacústica (LNME) and its main objective was to support and promote the work of Cuban electroaocustic composers and sound artists.\n\nSome years later, another electroacoustic music studio was created at the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA). The Estudio de Música Electroacústica y por Computadoras (EMEC), currently named Estudio Carlos Fariñas de Arte Musical (Carlos Fariñas Studio of Musical Electroacoustic Art), is intended to provide electroacoustic music training to the composition students during the last years of their careers.\n\nAfter 1970, Cuban composers such as Leo Brouwer, Jesús Ortega, Carlos Fariñas and Sergio Vitier began also creating electroacoustic pieces; and in the 1980s a group of composers that included Edesio Alejandro, Fernando (Archi) Rodríguez Alpízar, Marietta Véulens, Mirtha de la Torre, Miguel Bonachea and Julio Roloff, started receiving instruction and working at the ICAP Electroacoustic Studio. A list of Cuban composers that have utilized elecotroacoustics technology include Argeliers León, Juan Piñera, Roberto Valera, José Loyola, Ileana Pérez Velázquez and José Angel Pérez Puentes.\nMost Cuban composers that established their residence outside Cuba have worked with electroacoustic technology. These include composers Aurelio de la Vega, Armando Tranquilino, Tania León, Orlando Jacinto García, Armando Rodriguez Ruidiaz, Ailem Carvajal and Irina Escalante Chernova.\n\nThe guitar (as it is known today or in one of its historical versions) has been present in Cuba since the discovery of the island by Spain. As early as the 16th century, a musician named Juan Ortiz, from the village of Trinidad, is mentioned by famous chronicler Bernal Díaz del Castillo as \"gran tañedor de vihuela y viola\" (\"a great performer of the vihuela and the guitar\"). Another \"vihuelista\", Alonso Morón from Bayamo, is also mentioned in the Spanish conquest chronicles during the 16th century.\nA disciple of famous Spanish guitarist Dionisio Aguado, José Prudencio Mungol was the first Cuban guitarist trained in the Spanish guitar tradition. In 1893 he performed at a much acclaimed concert in Havana, after returning from Spain. Mungol actively participated in the musical life of Havana and was a professor at the Hubert de Blanck conservatory.\n\nSeverino López was born in Matanzas. He studied guitar in Cuba with Juan Martín Sabio and Pascual Roch, and in Spain with renowned Catalan guitarist Miguel Llobet. Severino López is considered the initiator in Cuba of the guitar school founded by Francisco Tárrega in Spain.\n\nClara Romero (1888-1951), founder of the modern Cuban School of Guitar, studied in Spain with Nicolás Prats and in Cuba with Félix Guerrero. She inaugurated the guitar department at the Havana Municipal Conservatory in 1931, where she also introduced the teachings of the Cuban folk guitar style. She created the Guitar Society of Cuba (Sociedad Guitarrística de Cuba) in 1940, and also the \"Guitar\" (Guitarra) magazine, with the purpose of promoting the Society's activities. She was the professor of many Cuban guitarists including her son Isaac Nicola and her daughter Clara (Cuqui) Nicola.\n\nAfter studying with his mother, Clara Romero, at the Havana Municipal Conservatory, Isaac Nicola (1916 – 1997) continued his training in Paris with Emilio Pujol, a disciple of Francisco Tárrega. He also studied the vihuela with Pujol and researched about the guitar's history and literature.\n\nAfter the Cuban revolution in 1959, Isaac Nicola and other professors such as Marta Cuervo, Clara (Cuqui) Nicola, Marianela Bonet and Leopoldina Núñez were integrated to the national music schools system, where a unified didactical method was implemented. This was a nucleus for the later development of a national Cuban Guitar School with which a new generation of guitarists and composers collaborated.\n\nMaybe the most important contribution to the modern Cuban guitar technique and repertoire comes from Leo Brouwer (born 1939). The grandson of Ernestina Lecuona, sister of Ernesto Lecuona, Brouwer began studying the guitar with his father and after some time continued with Isaac Nicola. He taught himself harmony, counterpoint, musical forms and orchestration before completing his studies at the Juilliard School and the University of Hartford.\n\nSince the 1960s, several generations of guitar performers, professors and composers have been formed under the Cuban Guitar School at educational institutions such as the Havana Municipal Conservatory, the National School of Arts, and the Instituto Superior de Arte. Others, such as Manuel Barrueco, a concertist of international renown, developed their careers outside the country. Among many other guitarists related to the Cuban Guitar School are Carlos Molina, Sergio Vitier, Flores Chaviano, Efraín Amador Piñero, Armando Rodriguez Ruidiaz, Martín Pedreira, Lester Carrodeguas, Mario Daly, José Angel Pérez Puentes and Teresa Madiedo. A younger group includes guitarists Rey Guerra, Aldo Rodríguez Delgado, Pedro Cañas, Leyda Lombard, Ernesto Tamayo, Miguel Bonachea, Joaquín Clerch and Yalil Guerra.\n\nAfter its arrival in Cuba at the end of the 18th century, the pianoforte (commonly called piano) rapidly became one of the favorite instruments among the Cuban population. Along with the humble guitar, the piano accompanied the popular Cuban \"guarachas\" and \"contradanzas\" (derived from the European Country Dances) at salons and ballrooms in Havana and all over the country. As early as in 1804, a concert program in Havana announced a vocal concert \"accompanied at the fortepiano by a distinguished foreigner recently arrived\"… and in 1832, Juan Federico Edelmann (1795-1848), a renowned pianist, son of a famous Alsatian composer and pianist, arrived in Havana and gave a very successful concert at the Teatro Principal. Encouraged by the warm welcome, Edelmann decided to stay in Havana, and he was very soon promoted to an important position within the Santa Cecilia Philharmonic Society. In 1836, he opened a music store and publishing company.\n\nOne of the most prestigious Cuban musicians, Ernesto Lecuona (1895-1963), began studying piano with his sister Ernestina and continued with Peyrellade, Saavedra, Nin and Hubert de Blanck. A child prodigy, Lecuona gave a concert, at just five, at the Círculo Hispano. When he graduated from the National Conservatory, he was awarded the First Prize and the Gold Medal of his class by unanimous decision of the board. He is by far the Cuban composer of greatest international recognition and his contributions to the Cuban piano tradition are considered exceptional.\n\nWe can find a representation of the bowed strings family in Cuba's history since a very early stage, because during the 16th century a musician from the Ville of Trinidad, named Juan Ortiz, is mentioned by the chronicler Bernal Díaz del Castillo as a \"great performer of \"vihuela\" and \"viola\" (Viol). The renaissance viol is the direct ancestor of the modern Italian violins, which began to become popular since the 16th century.\n\nOn February 8, 1764, Esteban Salas y Castro, the new Chapel Master, arrived at the Santiago de Cuba Cathedral. To fulfill his musical duties, Salas counted with a small vocal-instrumental group that included two violins.\n\nAfter the arrival in Santiago de Cuba, in 1793, of numerous colonists that fled from the slave revolt in Saint Domingue, \"someone named Karl Rischer and a Madame Clarais, that had brought with them a clavichord, founded an orchestra : flute, oboe, clarinet, trumpet, three horns, three violins, viola, two violoncellos and percussion…\".\n\nDuring the transition from the 18th to the 19th centuries, the Havanese Ulpiano Estrada (1777–1847) offered violin lessons and conducted the Teatro Principal orchestra from 1817 to 1820. Apart from his activity as a violinist, Estrada kept a very active musical career as a conductor of numerous orchestras, bands and operas, and composing many contradanzas and other dance pieces, such as minuets and valses.\n\nJosé Vandergutch, Belgian violinist, arrived at Havana along with his father Juan and brother Francisco, also violinists. They returned at a later time to Belgium, but José established his permanent residence in Havana, where he acquired great recognition. Vandergutch offered numeorus concerts as a soloist and accompanied by several orchestras, around the mid-19th century. He was a member of the Classical Music Association and also a Director of The \"Asociación Musical de Socorro Mutuo de La Habana.\"\n\nWithin the universe of the classical Cuban violin during the 19th century, there are two outstanding Masters that may be considered among the greatest violin virtuosos of all times; they are José White Lafitte y Claudio Brindis de Salas Garrido.\n\nAfter receiving his first musical instruction from his father, the virtuoso Cuban violinist José White Lafitte (1835–1918) offered his first concert in Matanzas on March 21, 1854. In that presentation he was accompanied by the famous American pianist and composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk, whom encouraged him to further his musical instruction in Paris, and also collected funds for that purpose.\n\nJosé White studied musical composition in the Conservatoire de Paris from 1855 to 1871. Just ten months after his arrival he received the First Price in the violin category on the Conservatorie's contest and was highly praised by Gioachino Rossini. At a later time he was a professor of the renowned violinists George Enescu and Jacques Thibaud.\n\nFrom 1877 to 1889, White was appointed as Director of the Imperial Conservatory in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, where he also served as court musician of the Emperor Pedro II. At a later time he returned to Paris where he stayed until his death. The famous violin named \"Swan's song\" was his preferred instrument and his most famous composition is the Habanera \"La bella cubana\". White also composed many other pieces, including a concert for violin and orchestra.\n\nClaudio José Domingo Brindis de Salas y Garrido (1852–1911) was a renowned Cuban vilinist, son of the also famous violinist, double-bassist and conductor Claudio Brindis de Salas (1800-1972), which conducted one of the most popular orchestras of Havana during the first half of the 19th century, named \"La Concha de Oro\" (The Golden Conch). Claudio José surpassed the fame and expertise of his father and came to acquire international recognition.\n\nClaudio Brindis de Salas Garrido began his musical studies with his father and continued with Maestros José Redondo and the Belgian José Vandergutch. He offered his first concert in Havana in 1863, in which Vandegutch participated as accompanist. The famous pianist and composer Ignacio Cervantes also participated in that event.\n\nAccording with the contemporary critique, Brindis de Salas was considered one of the most outstanding violinists of his time at an international level. Alejo Carpentier referred to him as: \"The most outstanding black violinist from the 19th century… something without any precedent in the musical history of the continent…\".\n\nThe French government named him member of the Légion d'Honneur, and gave him a nobility title of \"Baron\". In Buenos Aires he received a genuine Stradivarius, and while living in Berlin he married a German lady, was named Chamber Musician of the Emperor and received an honorary citizenship from that country. Brindis de Salas died poor and forgotten in 1911 from tuberculosis, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 1930 his remains were transferred to Havana with great honors.\n\nAnother outstanding Cuban violinist from the 19th century was Rafael Díaz Albertini (1857–1928). He studied violin with José Vandergutch and Anselmo López (1841-1858), well known Havanese violinist that was dedicated also to music publishing. In 1870, Albertini travelled to Paris with the purpose of perfecting his technique with famous violinist Jean-Delphin Alard, and in 1875 received First Price in the Paris Contest, in which he subsequently participated as a Juror. He toured extensively through the world, accompanied some times by prestigious Masters such as Hugo Wolf and Camille Saint-Saëns. In 1894 he made presentations, along with Ignacion Cervantes, through the most important cities of Cuba.\nA list of prominent Cuban violinist from the second half of the 19th century and the first of the 20th may include: Manuel Muñoz Cedeño (b. 1813), José Domingo Bousquet (b. 1823), Carlos Anckermann (b. 1829), Antonio Figueroa (b. 1852), Ramón Figueroa (b. 1862), Juan Torroella (b.1874), Casimiro Zertucha (b. 1880), Joaquín Molina (b. 1884), Marta de La Torre (1888), Catalino Arjona (b. 1895) and Diego Bonilla (1898-).\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century the name of Amadeo Roldán stands out (1900–1939), because apart from an excellent violinist, professor and conductor, Roldán is considered one of the most important Cuban composers of all times.\n\nAfter his graduation at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1935 with just 16 years old, the renowned Cuban violinist Ángel Reyes (1919–1988) developed a very successful career as a soloist and also accompanied by prestigious orchestras of many countries. He established his residence in the United States at a very young age, obtained an award in the Ysaÿe Contest in Brussels and was a professor at the Michigan and Northwestern Universities, until his retirement in 1985.\n\nEduardo Hernández Asiaín (1911-2010) was born in Havana, began his musical studies at a very early age and offered his first concert with just seven years old. When he was 14, he obtained the First Award at the Municipal Conservatory of Havana and was appointed as Concertino of the Havana Symphony Orchestra. In 1932, he travelled to Madrid to further his musical education with professors Enrique Fernández Arbós and Antonio Fernández Bordas. Since 1954, Hernández Asiaín performed as a soloist with the orchestras from the Pasdeloup Concert Society and the Radiodiffusion française in Paris, the \"Orquesta Nacional de España\", the \"Orquesta Sinfónica de Bilbao\", the \"Orquesta de Cámara de Madrid\" and the \"Orquesta Sinfónica y de Cámara de San Sebastián\", of which he is the founder. In 1968, he was appointed as First Violin of the \"Cuarteto Clásico\" of RTVE, participating with pianist Isabel Picaza González in the \"Quinteto Clásico de RNE\", with which he offered concerts and made numerous recordings in Spain and other countries. He also toured extensively through the US.\n\nOther prominent Cuban violinists from the first half of the 20th century are: Robero Valdés Arnau (1919-1974), Alberto Bolet and Virgilio Diago.\n\nAfter 1959, already in the post revolutionary period, stands out a Cuban violinist that has made a substantial contribution, not just to the development of the violin and the bowed string instruments, but also to the national musical culture in general.\n\nEvelio Tieles began to study music in Cuba with his father, Evelio Tieles Soler, when he was just seven years old, and continued at a later time with professor Joaquín Molina. Between 1952 and 1954, Tieles studied violin in Paris, France, with Jacques Thibaud and René Benedetti. In 1955 he returned to Paris and studied at the National Superior Music Conservatory in that city, and in 1958, he continued his musical training at Conservatorio Tchaikovsky in Moscú, where he was a disciple of renowned violinists David Oistrakh and Igor Oistrakh. Tieles graduated in 1963 and by recommendation of the Conservatory he pursued his master's degree from 1963 to 1966, with the same mentioned professors. Tieles received also professional training from the prestigious violinists Henryk Szeryng and Eduardo Hernández Asiaín.\n\nEvelio Tieles has offered numerous presentations as a concert performer, in a duo with his brother, pianist Cecilio Tieles, or accompanied by the Cuban National Symphony Orchestra and other symphonic and chamber ensembles. He has performed along with prestigious conductors such as Thomas Sanderling, Boris Brott, Enrique González Mántici y Manuel Duchesne Cuzán, among others.\n\nTieles has established his residence in Spain since 1984, and he teaches violin in the Vila-Seca Conservatory, in the province of Tarragona, where he has been appointed as \"Professor Emeritus\". He has also served at the Superior Conservatory of the Barcelona Lyceum as Chief of the Chamber Music Department (1991–1998), Head of the Division of Bowed String Instruments (1986-2002) and Academic Director (2000–2002).\n\nApart from his outstanding career as a concert performer and professor, during the Post-Revolutionary period, Tieles promoted and organized in Cuba the bowed string instruments training, fundamentally for the violin.\nAnother prominent violinist is professor Alla Tarán (1941). She was formed as a violinist in her native Ukraine and worked as a professor of Chamber Ensemble Practice. Tarán established her residence in Cuba since 1969.\n\nAlfredo Muñoz (1949) began studying the violin at Conservatorio Orbon in Havana, Cuba, and subsequently continued at the National School of Arts and the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA). He joined the National Symphony Orchestra as a violinist in 1972 and since then has been very active as a soloist and a member of the White Trio, in Cuba and abroad. He is currently a professor at the Instituto Superior de Artes (ISA).\n\nOther Cuban violinists that have developed their careers between the 20th and the 21st century are: Armando Toledo (1950), Julián Corrales (1954), Miguel del Castillo and Ricardo Jústiz.\n\nAlready at the beginning of the 21st century the violinists Ilmar López-Gavilán, Mirelys Morgan Verdecia, Ivonne Rubio Padrón, Patricia Quintero and Rafael Machado are worthy of note.\n\nOpera has been present in Cuba since the latest part of the 18th century, when the first full-fledged theater, called Coliseo, was built. Since then to present times, the Cuban people have highly enjoyed opera, and many Cuban composers have cultivated the operatic genre, sometimes with great success at an international level.\n\nThe first documented operatic event in Havana took place in 1776. That presentation was mentioned in a note published in the newspaper \"Diario de La Habana\" on December 19, 1815: \"…Today, Wednesday 19th of the current, if the weather allows, the new tragic opera of merit in three acts that contains 17 pieces of music, titled \"Dido Abandoned\" will be performed […] This is one of the premiere dramas from the French theater. In Italy, the one composed by renowned Metastasio deserved a singular applause, and was sung in this city on October 12, 1776.\"\nCristóbal Martínez Corrés was the first Cuban opera composer, but his Works, such as \"El diablo contrabandista\" and \"Don papanero\" were never premiered and haven't been preserved until the present time. Born in Havana, in 1822, composer and pianist Martínez Corrés established his residence together with his family in France when he was just nine years old; and at a later tame they went to Italy. Due to his premature death, a third opera named \"Safo\", never surpassed an early creative stage. Martínez Corrés died in Genoa, in 1842.\n\nGaspar Villate y Montes was born in Havana, in 1851 and since an early age he showed a great musical talent. As a child, he began to study piano with Nicolás Ruiz Espadero and in 1867, when he was just 16 years old, he composed his first opera on a drama by Victor Hugo, titled \"Angelo, tirano de Padua\". A year later, at the beginning of the 1868 war, he travelled to the United States with his family and upon his return to Havana in 1871 he wrote another opera called \"Las primeras armas de Richelieu\".\n\nVillate travelled to France with the purpose to continue his music studies in the Paris Conservatory, where he received classes from François Bazin, Victorien de Joncieres and Adolphe Danhauser. He composed numerous instrumental pieces such as \"contradanzas\", \"habaneras\", \"romances\" and \"waltzes\", and in 1877 he premiered with great audience acclaim his opera \"Zilia\" in Paris, which was presented in Havana in 1881. Since then, Villate focused his efforts mainly in opera and composed pieces such as \"La Zarina\" and \"Baltazar\", premiered at La Haya and Teatro Real de Madrid respectively. It is known that he worked on an opera with a Cuban theme called \"Cristóbal Colón\", but its manuscript has been lost.\n\nVillate died in Paris in 1891, soon after starting to compose a lyrical drama called \"Lucifer\", from which some fragments have been preserved.\n\nEduardo Sánchez de Fuentes was born in Havana, in 1874, within an artistic family; his father was a writer and his mother a pianist and singer. He began his musical studies at Conservatorio Hubert de Blanck and at a later time took classes from Carlos Anckermann. He received also a Law Degree in 1894. When Sánchez de Fuentes was just 18 years old, he composed the famous \"Habanera \"Tú\"\", which became an extraordinary international success. Alejo Carpentier said it was: \"the most famous Habanera\".\n\nOn October 26, 1898, Sánchez de Fuentes premiered at the Albisu Theater in Havana his first opera called \"Yumuri\", based on the Island's colonization theme. In it, an aborigine princess falls in love with a handsome Spanish conqueror, which abducts her at the wedding ceremony with another indigenous character. At the end, while escaping, both suffer a tragic death during an earthquake. Sánchez de Fuentes would go on to compose another five operas: \"El Náufrago\" (1901), \"Dolorosa\" (1910), \"Doreya\" (1918), \"El Caminante\" (1921) and \"Kabelia\" (1942).\n\nOne of the most active and outstanding composers of his generation, Sergio Fernández Barroso (also known as Sergio Barroso) (1946), is the author of an opera called \"La forma del camino\", which also possesses the complementary title of \"s-XIV-69\" (which means \"Siglo XIV – 1969\"). With an approximate duration of 60 minutes, this piece utilizes as a script a story from the \"Popol Vuh\" (the sacred text of the Maya culture) about the mythic brothers Hunahpu and Ixbalanqué. The score includes soloists and a choir of nine mixed voices, accompanied by an instrumental group and an electro-acoustic quadraphonic system. The scene requires a stage elevated over the choir spatial position, which members wear dinner jackets, in opposition to the more casual attire of the soloists. All singers wear Indian masks.\n\nMost recently the work of two young Cuban composers stand out, Jorge Martín (composer) and Louis Franz Aguirre.\n\nJorge Martín (1959) was born in Santiago de Cuba and established his residence in the US at a very young age. He studied musical composition at the Yale and Columbia Universities. He has composed thre lyric pieces: \"Beast and Superbeast\", a series of four operas in one act each, based on short stories by Saki; \"Tobermory\", opera in one act that obtained first prize in the Fifth Biennial of the National Opera Association (USA), and has been presented in several cities of the United States; and \"Before Night Falls\", an opera based on the famous autobiography of the Cuban novelist, playwright and poet Reinaldo Arenas, renowned dissident from the Fidel Castro government.\nLouis Franz Aguirre (1968) is currently one of the most prolific and renowned Cuban composers at an international level. His catalog includes four operatic works: \"Ebbó\" (1998), premiered on January 17, 1999, at the Brotfabrik Theater in Bonn, Germany; \"Ogguanilebbe\" (Liturgy of the divine word) (2005), premiered in the Salla dil Parlamento d'il Castello di Udine, Italy. \"Yo el Supremo\" (Comic play with Dictator in one Act), premiered on October 27, 2015 in the Teatro Galileo, Madrid, Spain and \"The way the dead love\" (Theogony: an operatic manifest), commissioned by the Lydenskab Ensemble and financed by KODA, Denmark. Premiered on February 24, 2017 in Godsbanen, Aarhus, Denmark, as part of the \"Århus European Capital of Culture 2017\".\n\nThroughout the years, the Cuban nation has developed a wealth of musicological material created by numerous investigators and experts on this subject. The work of some authors who provided information about the music in Cuba during the 19th century was usually included in chronicles covering a more general subject. The first investigations and studies specifically dedicated to the musical art and practice did not appear in Cuba until the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nA list of important personalities that have contributed to musicological studies in Cuba includes Fernando Ortiz, Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes, Emilio Grenet, Alejo Carpentier, Argeliers León, Maria Teresa Linares, Pablo Hernández Balaguer, Alberto Muguercia and Zoila Lapique.\n\nA second generation of musicologists formed after de Cuban revolution of 1959 include: Zoila Gómez, Victoria Elí, Alberto Alén Pérez, Rolando Antonio Pérez Fernández and Leonardo Acosta.\n\nIt is obvious that the first popular music played in Cuba after the Spanish conquest was brought by the Spanish conquerors themselves, and was most likely borrowed from the Spanish popular music in vogue during the 16th century. From the 16th to the 18th century some danceable songs that emerged in Spain were associated to Hispanic America, or considered as been originated in America. Some of these songs with picturesque names such as Sarabande, Chaconne, Zambapalo, Retambico and Gurumbé, among others, shared a common trait, its characteristic rhythm called Hemiola or Sesquiáltera (in Spain).\n\nThis rhythm has been described as the alternation or superposition of a duple meter and a triple meter (6/8 + 3/4), and its utilization was widespread in the Spanish territory since at least the 13th century, where it appears in one of the Cantigas de Santa María (Como poden per sas culpas).\n\nHemiola or Sesquiáltera is also a typical rhythm within the African musical traditions, both from the North of the Continent as from the South. Therefore, it is quite probable that the original song-dances brought by the Spanish to America already included elements from the African culture with which the black slaves that arrived to the Island were familiar; and they further utilized them in order to create new creole genres.\n\nThe well known Son de la Ma Teodora, an ancient Cuban song, as well as the first Cuban autochthonous genres, Punto and Zapateo, show the Sesquiáltera rhythm on their accompaniment, which greatly associate those genres to the Spanish song-dances from the 16th to the 18th centuries.\n\nIt seems that Punto and Zapateo Cubano were the first autochthonous musical genres of the Cuban nation. Although the first printed sample of a Cuban Creole Zapateo (Zapateo Criollo) was not published until 1855 in the \"Álbum Regio of Vicente Díaz de Comas\", it is possible to find references about the existence of those genres since long time before. Its structural characteristics have survived almost unaltered through a period of more than two hundred years and they are usually considered the most typically Hispanic Cuban popular music genres. \nCuban musicologists María Teresa Linares, Argeliers León and Rolando Antonio Pérez coincide in thinking that Punto and Zapateo are based on Spanish dance –songs (such as chacone and sarabande) that arrived first at the most important population centers such as Havana and Santiago de Cuba and then spread throughout the surrounding rural areas where they were adopted and modified by the peasant (campesino) population at a later time.\n\nPunto guajiro or Punto Cubano, or simply Punto is a sung genre of Cuban music, an improvised poetic-music art that emerged in the western and central regions of Cuba during the 19th century. Although Punto appears to come from an Andalusian origin, it is a true Cuban genre because of its creole modifications.\n\nPunto is played by a group with various types of plucked string instruments: the tiple (a treble guitar currently in disuse), the Spanish guitar, the Cuban tres, and the laúd. The word punto refers to the use of a plucked technique (punteado), rather than strumming (rasgueado). Also some percussion instruments have been utilized such as the clave, the güiro and the guayo ( a metallic scraper). Singers gather themselves in contending teams, and improvise their lines.\n\nThey sing fixed melodies called \"tonadas\" which are based on a meter of ten strophe verses called \"décimas\", with intervals between stanzas to give the singers some time to prepare the next verse. Early compositions were sometimes recorded and published, as were the names of some of the singers and composers. Beginning around 1935, Punto reached a peak of popularity on Cuban radio.\n\nPunto was one of the first Cuban genres recorded by American companies at the beginning of the 20th century, but at a later time the interest decayed and little effort was made to continue recording the live radio performances. A fan of this genre, stenographer Aida Bode, wrote down many verses as they were broadcast and finally, in 1997, her transcriptions were published in book form.\n\nCelina González and Albita Rodríguez both sang Punto at the beginning of their careers, proving that the genre is still alive. Celina had one of the greatest voices in popular music, and her supporting group Campo Alegre was outstanding. For aficionados, however, Indio Naborí (Sabio Jesús Orta Ruiz, b. 30 September 1922) is the greatest name in Punto for his \"decima\" poetry, which he wrote daily for the radio and newspapers. He is also a published author with several collections of his poetry, much of which has a political nueva trova edge.\n\nZapateo is a typical dance of the Cuban \"campesino\" or \"guajiro,\" of Spanish origin. It is a dance of pairs, involving tapping of the feet, mostly performed by the male partner. Illustrations exist from previous centuries and today it survives cultivated by Folk Music Groups as a fossil genre. It was accompanied by tiple, guitar and güiro, in combined 6/8 and 3/4 rhythm (hemiola), accented on the first of every three quavers.\n\nA genre of Cuban song similar to the Punto cubano and the Criolla. It contains bucolic countryside lyrics, similar to décima poetry. Its music shows a mixture of 6/8 and 3/4 rhythms called Hemiola. According to Sánchez de Fuentes, its first section is usually presented in a minor key, and its second section in its direct major relative key.\nThe term Guajira is now used mostly to describe a slow dance music in 4/4 time, a fusion of the Guajira (music) and the Son (called Guajira-Son). Singer and guitarist Guillermo Portabales was the most outstanding representative of this genre.\n\nCriolla is a genre of Cuban music which is closely related to the music of the Cuban Coros de Clave and a genre of Cuban popular music called Clave.[1]\n\nThe Clave became a very popular genre in the Cuban vernacular theater and was created by composer Jorge Anckermann based on the style of the Coros de Clave. The Clave served, in turn, as a model for the creation of a new genre called Criolla. According to musicologist Helio Orovio, \"Carmela\", the first Criolla, was composed by Luis Casas Romero in 1909, which also created one of the most famous Criollas of all times, \"El Mambí\".[2]\n\nClearly, the origin of African groups in Cuba is due to the island's long history of slavery. Compared to the US, slavery started in Cuba much earlier and continued for decades afterwards. Cuba was the last country in the Americas to abolish the importation of slaves, and the second last to free the slaves. In 1807 the British Parliament outlawed slavery, and from then on the British Navy acted to intercept Portuguese and Spanish slave ships. By 1860 the trade with Cuba was almost extinguished; the last slave ship to Cuba was in 1873. The abolition of slavery was announced by the Spanish Crown in 1880, and put into effect in 1886. Two years later, Brazil abolished slavery.\n\nThe roots of most Afro-Cuban musical forms lie in the cabildos, self-organized social clubs for the African slaves, separate cabildos for separate cultures. The cabildos were formed mainly from four groups: the Yoruba (the Lucumi in Cuba); the Congolese (Palo in Cuba); Dahomey (the Fon or Arará). Other cultures were undoubtedly present, more even than listed above, but in smaller numbers, and they did not leave such a distinctive presence.\n\nCabildos preserved African cultural traditions, even after the abolition of slavery in 1886. At the same time, African religions were transmitted from generation to generation throughout Cuba, Haiti, other islands and Brazil. These religions, which had a similar but not identical structure, were known as \"Lucumi\" or \"Regla de Ocha\" if they derived from the Yoruba, \"Palo\" from Central Africa, \"Vodú\" from Haiti, and so on. The term \"Santería\" was first introduced to account for the way African spirits were joined to Catholic saints, especially by people who were both baptized and initiated, and so were genuinely members of both groups. Outsiders picked up the word and have tended to use it somewhat indiscriminately. It has become a kind of catch-all word, rather like salsa in music.\n\nAll these African cultures had musical traditions, which survive erratically to the present day, not always in detail, but in general style. The best preserved are the African polytheistic religions, where, in Cuba at least, the instruments, the language, the chants, the dances and their interpretations are quite well preserved. In what other American countries are the religious ceremonies conducted in the old language(s) of Africa? They certainly are in Lucumí ceremonies, though of course, back in Africa the language has moved on. What unifies all genuine forms of African music is the unity of polyrhythmic percussion, voice (call-and-response) and dance in well-defined social settings, and the absence of melodic instruments of an Arabic or European kind.\n\nReligious traditions of African origin have survived in Cuba, and are the basis of ritual music, song and dance quite distinct from the secular music and dance. The religion of Yoruban origin is known as \"Lucumí\" or \"Regla de Ocha\"; the religion of Congolese origin is known as \"Palo\", as in \"palos del monte\". There are also, in the Oriente region, forms of Haitian ritual together with its own instruments, music etc.\n\nThe clave rhythmic pattern is used as a tool for temporal organization in Afro-Cuban music, such as rumba, conga de comparsa, son, mambo (music), salsa, Latin jazz, songo and timba. The five-stroke clave pattern (distributed in groups of 3 + 2 or 2 + 3 beats) represents the structural core of many Afro-Cuban rhythms. Just as a keystone holds an arch in place, the clave pattern holds the rhythm together in Afro-Cuban music. The clave pattern originated in sub-Saharan African music traditions, where it serves essentially the same function as it does in Cuba. The pattern is also found in the African diaspora musics of Haitian Vodou drumming and Afro-Brazilian music. The clave pattern is used in North American popular music as a rhythmic motif or ostinato, or simply a form of rhythmic decoration.\n\nIn Cuba, the word \"comparsa\" refers to the \"Cabildos de Nación\" neighbourhood groups that took part in the carnival authorized by the Spanish government on the Three Kings Day (Día de Reyes) during the colonial period. Conga is of African origin, and derives from street celebrations of the African spirits. The distinction is blurred today, but in the past the congas have been prohibited from time to time. Carnival as a whole was banned by the revolutionary government for many years, and still does not take place with the regularity of old. Conga drums are played (along with other typical instruments) in comparsas of all kinds. Santiago de Cuba and Havana were the two main centers for street carnivals. Two types of dance music (at least) owe their origin to comparsa music:\n\nConga: an adaptation of comparsa music and dance for social dances. Eliseo Grenet may be the person who first created this music, but it was the Lecuona Cuban Boys who took it around the world. The conga became, and perhaps still is, the best-known Cuban music and dance style for non-latins.\n\nMozambique is a comparsa-type dance music developed by \"Pello el Afrokan\" (Pedro Izquierdo) in 1963. It had a brief period of high popularity, peaked in 1965, and was soon forgotten. Apparently, to make it work properly, it needed 16 drums plus other percussion and dancers...\n\nImmigrants from Haiti settled in Oriente and established their style of music, called Tumba Francesa, which uses its own type of drum, dance and song. It embodies one of the oldest and most tangible links to the Afro-Haitian heritage of Cuba's Oriente province and developed from an eighteenth-century fusion of music from Dahomey in West Africa and traditional French dances. This fossil genre survives to the present day in Santiago de Cuba and Haiti, performed by specialized folk ensembles.\n\nThe Contradanza is an important precursor of several later popular dances. It arrived in Cuba in the late 18th century from Europe where it had been developed first as the English country dance, and then as the French contradanse. The origin of the word is a corruption of the English term \"country dance\". Manuel Saumell wrote over fifty contradanzas (in 2/4 or 6/8 time), in which his rhythmic and melodic inventiveness was astonishing.\n\nThe Contradanza is a communal sequence dance, with the dance figures conforming to a set pattern. The selection of figures for a particular dance was usually set by a master of ceremonies or dance leader. There were two parts of 16 bars each, danced in a line or square format. The tempo and style of the music was bright and fairly fast.\n\nThe earliest Cuban creole composition of a Contradanza appeared published in Havana in 1803 and was named \"San Pascual bailón\". This version shows for the first time the well known rhythm of \"Tango\" or \"Habanera\" which differentiates it from the European contradance. The Cubans developed a number of creolized version, such as the \"paseo\", \"cadena\", \"sostenido\" and \"cedazo\". This creolization is an early example of the influence of the African traditions in the Caribbean. Most of the musicians were black or mulatto (even early in the 19th century there were many freed slaves and mixed race persons living in Cuban towns). \"The women of Havana have a furious taste for dancing; they spend entire nights elevated, agitated, crazy and pouring sweat until they fall spent.\"\nThe contradanza supplanted the minuet as the most popular dance until from 1842 on, it gave way to the habanera, a quite different style.\n\nThis genere, the offspring of the contradanza, was also danced in lines or squares. It was also a brisk form of music and dance in double or triple time. A repeated 8-bar paseo was followed by two 16-bar sections called the primera and segunda. One famous composer of danzas was Ignacio Cervantes, whose forty-one danzas cubanas were a landmark in musical nationalism. This type of dance was eventually replaced by the danzón, which was, like the habanera, much slower and more sedate.\n\nThe habanera developed out of the contradanza in the early 19th century. Its great novelty was that it was \"sung\", as well as played and danced. Written in 2/4 meter, the Habanera is characterized by an expressive and languid melodious development and its characteristic rhythm called \"Habanera Rhythm.\"\n\nThe dance style of the habanera is slower and more stately than the danza. By the 1840s habaneras were written, sung, and danced in Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and Spain. Since about 1900 the habanera has been a relic dance; but the music has a period charm, and there are some famous compositions, such as \"Tú\" from Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes, which has been recorded in many versions.\n\nVersions of habanera-type compositions have appeared in the music of Ravel, Bizet, Saint-Saëns, Debussy, Fauré, Albeniz. The rhythm is similar to that of the tango, and some believe the habanera is the musical father of the tango.\n\nThe European influence on Cuba's later musical development is represented by danzón, an elegant musical form that was once more popular than the Son in Cuba. It is a descendent of the creollized Cuban contradanza. The danzón marks the change from the communal sequence dance style of the late 18th century to the couple dances of later times. The stimulus for this was the success of the once-scandalous walz, where couples danced facing each other, independently from other couples and not as part of a pre-set structure. The danzón was the first Cuban dance to adopt such methods, though there is a difference between the two dances. The walz is a progressive ballroom dance where couples move round the floor in an anti-clockwise direction; the danzón is a 'pocket-handkerchief' dance where a couple stays within a small area of the floor.\n\nThe danzón was developed by Miguel Faílde in Matanzas, the official date of origin being 1879. Failde's was an orquesta típica, a form derived from military bands, using brass, kettle-drums etc. The later development of the charanga was more suited to the indoor salon and is an orchestral format still popular today in Cuba and some other countries. The charanga uses double bass, cello, violins, flute, piano, paila criolla and güiro. This change in instrumental set-up is illustrated in Early Cuban bands.\nFrom time to time in its 'career', the danzón acquired African influences in its musical structure. It became more syncopated, especially in its third part. The credit for this is given to José Urfé, who worked elements of the son into the last part of the danzón in his composition \"El bombin de Barreto\" (1910). Both the danzón and the charanga line-up have been strongly influential in later developments.\n\nThe danzón was exported to popular acclaim throughout Latin America, especially Mexico. It is now a relic, both in music and in dance, but its highly orchestrated descendents live on in charangas that Faílde and Urfé would likely not recognize. Juan Formell has had a huge influence through his reorganization of first Orquesta Revé, and later Los Van Van.\n\nEarly Danzons were purely instrumental. The first to introduce a vocal part in a Danzón was Aniceto Díaz (in 1927 in Matanzas), that was called \"Rompiendo la rutina\", thereby creating a new genre called the Danzonete. Later, the black singer Barbarito Diez joined the charanga of Antonio María Romeu in 1935 and, over the years, recorded eleven albums of Danzonetes. All later forms of the Danzón have included vocals.\n\nOn January 20, 1801, Buenaventura Pascual Ferrer published a note in a newspaper called \"El Regañón de La Habana,\" in which he refers to certain chants that \"run outside there through vulgar voices\". Between them he mentioned a \"guaracha\" named \"La Guabina\", about which he says: \"in the voice of those that sings it, tastes like any thing dirty, indecent or disgusting that you can think about…\" At a later time, in an undetermined date, \"La Guabina\" appears published between the first musical scores printed in Havana at the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nAccording to the commentaries published in \"El Regañón de La Habana\", it can be concluded that those \"guarachas\" were very popular within the Havana population at that time, because in the same previously mentioned article the author says: \"…but most importantly, what bothers me most is the liberty with which a number of chants are sung throughout the streets and town homes, where innocence is insulted and morals offended… by many individuals, not just of the lowest class, but also by some people that are supposed to be called well educated...\" Therefore, it can be said that those \"guarachas\" of a very audacious content, were apparently already sung within a wide social sector of the Havana population.\n\nAccording to Alejo Carpentier (quoting Buenaventura Pascual Ferrer), at the beginning of the 19th century there were held in Havana up to fifty dance parties every day, where the famous \"guaracha\" was sung and danced, among other popular pieces.\n\nThe guaracha is a genre of rapid tempo and comic or picaresque lyrics. It originated at the end of the 18th century, and during the early 20th century was still often played in the brothels and other places in Havana. The lyrics were full of slang, and dwelt on events and people in the news. Rhythmically, guaracha exhibits a series of rhythm combinations, such as 6/8 with 2/4.\n\nMany of the early trovadores, such as Manuel Corona (who worked in a brothel area of Havana), composed and sang guarachas as a balance for the slower boleros and canciones. The satirical lyric content also fitted well with the son, and many bands played both genres. In the mid-20th century the style was taken up by the conjuntos and big bands as a type of up-tempo music. Today it seems no longer to exist as a distinct musical form; it has been absorbed into the vast maw of Salsa. Singers who can handle the fast lyrics and are good improvisors are called \"guaracheros\" or \"guaracheras\".\n\nFrom the 18th century (at least) to modern times, popular theatrical formats used, and gave rise to, music and dance. Many famous composers and musicians had their careers launched in the theatres, and many famous compositions got their first airing on the stage. In addition to staging some European operas and operettas, Cuban composers gradually developed ideas that better suited their audience. Recorded music was to be the couduit for Cuban music to reach the world. The most recorded artist in Cuba up to 1925 was a singer at the \"Alhambra\", Adolfo Colombo. Records show he recorded about 350 numbers between 1906 and 1917.\n\nThe first theatre in Havana opened in 1776. The first Cuban-composed opera appeared in 1807. Theatrical music was hugely important in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century; its significance only began to wane with the change in political and social weather in the second part of the 20th century. Radio, which began in Cuba in 1922, helped the growth of popular music because it provided publicity and a new source of income for the artists.\n\nZarzuela is a small-scale light operetta format. Starting off with imported Spanish content (List of zarzuela composers), it developed into a running commentary on Cuba's social and political events and problems. Zarzuela has the distinction of providing Cuba's first recordings: the soprano Chalía Herrera (1864–1968) made, outside Cuba, the first recordings by a Cuban artist. She recorded numbers from the zarzuela \"Cadíz\" in 1898 on unnumbered Bettini cylinders.\n\nZarzuela reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century. A string of front-rank composers such as Gonzalo Roig, Eliseo Grenet, Ernesto Lecuona and Rodrigo Prats produced a series of hits for the \"Regina\" and \"Martí\" theatres in Havana. Great stars like the \"vedette\" Rita Montaner, who could sing, play the piano, dance and act, were the Cuban equivalents of Mistinguett and Josephine Baker in Paris. Some of the best known zarzuelas are \"La virgen morena\" (Grenet), \"La Niña Rita\" (Grenet and Lecuona), \"María la O\", \"El batey\", \"Rosa la China\" (all Lecuona); Gonzalo Roig with \"La Habana de noche\"; Rodrigo Prats with \"Amalia Batista\" and \"La perla del caribe\"; and above all, \"Cecilia Valdés\" (the musical of the most famous Cuban novel of the 19th century, with music by Roig and script by Prats and Agustín Rodríguez). Artists who were introduced to the public in the lyric theatre include Caridad Suarez, María de los Angeles Santana, Esther Borja and Ignacio Villa, who had such a round, black face that Rita Montaner called him Bola de Nieve ('Snowball').\n\nAnother famous singer was Maruja González Linares. Born from Spanish parents in the Mexican locality of Mérida, Yucatán in 1904, González travelled from Cuba to the US at a very young age. She studied vocal techniques in Cuba, where she made her debut in 1929 as a lyrical singer in the Company of Maestro Ernesto Lecuona. González performed in several theaters of Havana before going on a tour through the United States and, upon her return to Havana, she sang \"La Bayadere\" and \"The Merry Widow\" in the same city. At the beginning of the 1930s, she signed a number of contracts in Latin America and in Spain. She married Perico Suarez. The Cuban Revolution caught her abroad and she never returned to her country. She died in Miami in 1999.\n\nCuban \"bufo theatre\" is a form of comedy, ribald and satirical, with stock figures imitating types that might be found anywhere in the country. Bufo had its origin around 1800-15 as an older form, \"tonadilla\", began to vanish from Havana. Francisco Covarrubias the 'caricaturist' (1775–1850) was its creator. Gradually, the comic types threw off their European models and became more and more creolized and Cuban. Alongside, the music followed. Argot from slave barracks and poor barrios found its way into lyrics that are those of the guaracha:\n\nThe \"guaracha\" occupied a predominant place within the development of vernacular theater in Cuba, which appearance at the beginning of the 19th century coincides with the emergence of the first autochthonous Cuban musical genres, the \"guaracha\" and the\"contradanza.\". Since 1812, Francisco Covarrubias (considered as the father of the Bufo Theater) gradually substituted in his theatrical pieces the typical characters of the Spanish \"tonadilla escénica\" with creole characters such as \"guajiros\", \"monteros\", \"carreteros\" or \"peones\". Those structural transformations were also associated to certain changes in the musical background of the pieces. Thus, the Spanish genres such as \"jácaras\", \"tiranas\", \"boleras\" or \"villancicos\", were substituted by \"guarachas\", \"décimas\" and \"canciones cubanas.\"\n\nVernacular theatre of various types often includes music. Formats rather like the British Music Hall, or the American Vaudeville, still occur, where an audience is treated to a potpourri of singers, comedians, bands, sketches and speciality acts. Even in cinemas during the silent movies, singers and instrumentalists appeared in the interval, and a pianist played during the films. Bola de Nieve and María Teresa Vera played in cinemas in their early days. Burlesque was also common in Havana before 1960.\n\nIn reference to the emergence of the Guaracha and, at a later time, also of the Urban Rumba in Havana and Matanzas, it is important to mention an important and picturesque social sector called Black Curros (Negros Curros). Composed of free blacks that had arrived from Seville on an undetermined date, this group was integrated to the population of free blacks and mulattos that lived in the marginal zones of the city of Havana.\n\nJosé Victoriano Betancourt a Cuban \"costumbrista\" writer from the 19th century described them as follows: \"…they [the curros] had a peculiar aspect, and was enough to look at them to recognize them as curros: their long hunks of kinky braids, falling over their face and neck like big millipedes, their teeth cut (sharp and pointed) to the carabalí style, their fine embroidered cloth shirts, their pants, almost always white, or with colored stripes, narrow at the waist and very wide in the legs; the canvas shoes, cut low with silver buckles, the short jacket with pointed tail, the exaggerated straw hat, with black hanging silk tassles, and the thick gold hoops that they wore in their ears, from which they hung harts and padlocks of the same metal, forming an ornament that only they wear; …those were the curros of El Manglar (The mangrove neighborhood)...\"\n\nThe curro was dedicated to laziness, theft and procuring, while his companion, the curra, also called \"mulata de rumbo\", exercised the prostitution in Cuba. According to Carlos Noreña, she was well known for the use of burato shawls of meticulous work and plaited fringes, for which they used to pay from nine to ten ounces of gold\", as well as by the typical clacking (chancleteo) they produced with their wooden slippers.\n\nBut the Curros also provided entertainment, including songs and dances to the thousands of Spanish men that came to the Island every year in the ships that followed the \"Carrera de Indias\", a route established by the Spanish Crown for their galleons in order to avoid attacks from pirates and privateers, and stayed for months until they returned to the Port of Seville.\n\nBeing subject to the influence of both the Spanish and the African culture from birth, they are supposed to have played an important role in the creolization of the Spanish song-dances original proto-type (copla-estribillo) that originated the Cuban Guaracha. The Black curro and the Mulata de Rumbo (Black Curra) disappeared since the mid 19th century by integrating to the Havana general population, but their picturesque images survived in social prototypes manifested in the characters of the Bufo Theater.\n\nThe famous \"Mulatas de Rumbo\" (mulatto characters) Juana Chambicú and María La O, as well as the black \"cheches\" (bullies) José Caliente \"who rips in half those who oppose him,\" Candela, \"negrito that flies and cuts with the knife,\" as well as the Black Curro Juán Cocuyo, were strongly linked to the characteristic image of the Black Curro and to the ambiance of the Guaracha and the Rumba.\n\nThe word Rumba is an abstract term that has been applied with different purposes to a wide variety of subjects for a very long time. From a semantic point of view, the term rumba is included in a group of words with similar meaning such as conga, milonga, bomba, tumba, samba, bamba, mambo, tambo, tango, cumbé, cumbia and candombe. All of them denote a Congolese origin due to the utilization of sound combinations such as, mb, ng and nd, that are typical of the Niger-Congo linguistic complex.\n\nMaybe the most ancient and general of its meanings is that of a feast or \"holgorio\". As far as the second half of the 19th century, this word can be found used several times to represent a feast in a short story called \"La mulata de rumbo\", from the Cuban folklorist Francisco de Paula Gelabert: \"...I have more enjoyment and fun in a rumbita with those of my color and class...\", or \" Leocadia was going to bed, as I was telling you, nothing less than at twelve noon, when one of his friends from the rumbas arrived, along with another young man that he wanted to introduce to her…\" According to Alejo Carpentier \"…it is significant that the word rumba have passed to the Cuban language as a synonym of holgorio, lewd dance, merrymaking with low class women (mujeres del rumbo).\"\n\nAs an example, In the case of the Yuka, Makuta and Changüí feasts in Cuba, as well as the Milonga and the Tango in Argentina, the word rumba was originally utilized to nominate a festive gathering; and after some time it was used to name the musical and dance genres that were played at those gatherings.\n\nAmong many others, some ultizations of the term \"rumba include a cover-all term for faster Cuban music which started in the early 1930s with \"The Peanut Vendor\". This term was replaced during the 70s by salsa, which is also a cover-all term for marketing the Cuban music and other Hispano-Caribbean genres to non-Cubans. In the international Latin-American dance syllabus rumba is a misnomer for the slow Cuban rhythm more accurately called bolero-son.\n\nSome scholars have pointed out that in reference to the utilization of the terms rumba and guaracha, there is possibly a case of synonymy, or the use of two different words to denominate the same thing. According to María Teresa Linares: \"… during the first years of the 20th century, there were used at the end of the vernacular (Bufo) theater plays some musical fragments that the authors sang, and that were called closing rumba (rumba final)…\" and she continues explaining that those (rumbas) \"...were certainly guarachas.\" The musical pieces used to close those plays may have been indistinctly called rumbas or guarachas, because those terms didn't denote any generic or structural difference between them. Linares also said in reference to this subject: \"Some recordings of guarachas and rumbas have been preserved that do not differentiate between them in the guitar parts – when it was a small group, duo or trio, or by the theater orchestra or a piano. The labels of the recordings stated: dialogue and rumba (diálogo y rumba).\"\n\nUrban rumba (also called Rumba (de solar o de cajón)), is an amalgamation of several African drumming and dance traditions, combined with Spanish influences. According to Cuban musicologist Argeliers León: \"In the feast that constituted a rumba concurred, therefore, determined African contributions, but also converged other elements from Hispanic roots, that were already incorporated to the expressions that appeared in the new population emerging in the Island.\" \nRumba (de solar o de cajón) is a secular musical style from the docks and the less prosperous areas of Havana and Matanzas. A the beginning, rumba musicians used a trio of wooden boxes (cajones) to play, that were substituted at a later time by drums, similar in appearance to conga drums. The treble drum is called \"quinto\", the medium range drum is called \"macho or tres-dos\" (three-two), because its essential rhythm is based on the Cuban clave pattern, and the bass drum is called \"hembra o salidor,\" because it usually began or \"broke in\" (rompía) the rumba. In the Rumba ensemble they also utilize two sticks or spoons to beat over a hollow piece of bamboo called \"guagua\" or \"catá,\" as well as the Cuban Claves, the Güiro and some rattles from bantu origin called \"nkembi\".\n\nThe vocal part of the rumba corresponds to a modified version of the ancient Spanish style of \"copla-estribillo\" (quatrain-refrain), including a \"montuno\" section that one may consider an expanded or developed \"refrain\" that constitute an independent section which include the call and response style, so typical of the African traditions.\nFrom the many rumba styles that began to appear during the end of the 19th century called \"Spanish times\" (Tiempo'españa), such as tahona, jiribilla, palatino and resedá, three basic Rumba forms have survived: the Columbia, the guaguancó and the yambú. The Columbia, played in 6/8 time, is often as a solo dance performed only by a male performer. It is fast and swift and also includes aggressive and acrobatic moves. The guaguancó is danced by a pair of one man and one woman. The dance simulates the man's pursuit of the woman. The yambú, now a relic, featured a burlesque imitation of an old man walking with a stick. All forms of rumba are accompanied by song or chants.\n\nRumba (de solar o de cajón) is today a fossil genre usually seen in Cuba in performances of professional groups. There are also amateur groups based on \"Casas de Cultura\" (Culture Centers), and on work groups. Like all aspects of life in Cuba, dance and music are organised by the state through Ministries and their various committees.\n\nCoros de Clave were popular choral groups that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century in Havana and other Cuban cities.\n\nThe Cuban government only allowed black people, slaves or free, to cultivate their cultural traditions within the boundaries of certain mutual aid societies, which were founded during the 16th century. According to David H. Brown, those societies, called Cabildos, \"provided in times of sickness and death, held masses for deceased members, collected funds to buy nation-brethren out of slavery, held regular dances and diversions on Sundays and feast days, and sponsored religious masses, processions and dancing carnival groups (now called comparsas) around the annual cycle of Catholic festival days.\"\n\nWithin the Cabildos of certain neighborhoods from Havana, Matanzas, Sancti Spíritus and Trinidad, some choral groups were founded during the 19th century that organized competitive activities, and in some occasions were visited by local authorities and neighbors that gave them money and presents. Those choral societies were called Coros de Clave, probably after the instrument that used to accompany their performances, the Cuban Claves.\n\nThe accompaniment of the choirs also included a guitar and the percussion was executed over the sound box of an American banjo from which the strings were removed, due to the fact that African drums performance was strictly forbidden in Cuban cities. The style of the Coros de Clave music, and particulally its rhythm, originated at a later time a popular song genre called Clave, which most probable served as the original prototype for the creation of the Criolla genre. Both genres, the Clave and the Criolla became very popular within the Cuban vernacular theater repertoire.\n\nIn a similar way as the first Spanish song-dances spread from the cities to the countryside, also the characteristics of the Cuban Guaracha, that enjoyed great popularity in Havana, began to spread to the rural areas in an undetermined time during the 19th century. This process was not difficult at all if one considers how close one to the other were the urban and the rural areas in Cuba at that time. That was why the Cuban peasants (guajiros) began to include in their parties called \"guateques\" or \"changüís\", and in feasts such as the \"fiestas patronales\" (patron saint celebrations) and the \"parrandas\", some Rumbitas (little rumbas) that were very similar to the urban Guarachas, which binary meter contrasted with the ternary beat of their traditional \"tonadas\" and \"zapateos\".\n\nThose little rural rumbas have been called by renowned musicologist Danilo Orozco \"proto-sones\", \"soncitos primigenios\", \"rumbitas\", \"nengones\"or \"marchitas,\" and some of them, such as: Caringa, Papalote, Doña Joaquina, Anda Pepe and the Tingotalango have been preserved until the present time.\n\nThe Rumbitas were considered as Proto-sones (primeval Sones), because of the evident analogy that its structural components show with the Son, which emerged in Havana during the first decades of the 20th century. The Rumbitas may be considered as the original prototype of this popular genre.\n\nAccording to musicologist Virtudes Feliú, those Rumbitas appeared in cities and towns throughout the entire territory of the Island, such as: Ciego de Ávila, Sancti Espíritus, Cienfuegos, Camagüey, Puerta de Golpe in Pinar del Río and Bejucal in Havana, as well as Remedios in Villa Clara and Isla de Pinos (Pines Island).\n\nThere are many references to the Cuban Independence Wars (1868-1898), related to the rural Rumbitas, in the Eastern region of the country as well as in the Western region and Isla de Pinos, which suggest that their emergence took place approximately during the second half of the 19th century.\n\nThe rural Rumbitas included a greater number of African characteristics in comparison with the Cuban Guaracha, due to the gradual integration of free Afro-Cuban citizens to the rural environment.\n\nSince the 16th century, thanks to a government approved program called \"manumisión\", the black slaves were allowed to pay for their freedom with their own savings. Therefore, a larger number of free blacks were dedicated to the manual labors in the fields than in the cities and some of them were also able to become proprietaries of land and slaves.\n\nOne of the most salient characteristics of the rural Rumbitas was its own form, very similar to the African typical song structure. In this case, the entire piece was based on a single musical fragment or phrase of short duration that was repeated, with some variations, time and time again; often alternating with a choir. This style was called \"Montuno\" (literally \"from the countryside\") due to its rural origin.\nAnother characteristic of the new genre was the superposition of different rhythmic patterns simultaneously executed, similarly to the way it is utilized in the Urban Rumba, which is also a common trait of the African musical tradition. Those layers or \"franjas de sonoridades\" according to Argeliers León, were assigned to different instruments that were gradually incorporated to the group. Therefore, the ensemble grew from the traditional Tiple and Güiro, to a one that included: guitar, \"bandurria\", Cuban lute, claves, and other instruments such as the\"tumbandera\", the \"marímbula\", the \"botija\", the bongoes, the common \"machete\" (cutlass) and the accordion.\n\nSome important musical functions were assigned to the sonority layers, such as the: \"Time Line\" or Clave Rhythm performed by the claves, a \"1-eighth note + 2-sixteenth notes\" rhythm played by the güiro or the machete, the patterns of the \"guajeo\" by the Tres (instrument), the improvisation on the bongoes and the anticipated bass on the \"tumbandera\" or the \"botija\".\n\nThe origin of the Cuban son can be traced to the rural rumbas, called proto-sones (primeval sones) by musicologist Danilo Orozco. They show, in a partial or embryonic form, all the characteristics that at a later time were going to identify the Son style: The repetition of a phrase called \"montuno\", the clave pattern, a rhythmic counterpoint between different layers of the musical texture, the \"guajeo\" from the Tres, the rhythms from the guitar, the bongoes and the double bass and the call and response style between soloist and choir. \nAccording to Radamés Giro: at a later time the refrain (estribillo) or \"montuno\" was tied to a quatrain (cuarteta – copla) called \"regina\", which was how the peasants from the Eastern side of the country called the quatrain. In this way, the structure \"refrain–quatrain–refrain\" appears at a very early stage in the \"Son Oriental,\" like in one of the most ancient Sones called \"Son de Máquina\" (Machine Son) which comprises three \"reginas\" with its correspondent refrains.\n\nDuring an investigative project about the Valera-Miranda family (old Soneros) conducted by Danilo Orozco in the region of Guantánamo, he recorded a sample of Nengón, which is considered an ancestor of the Changüí. It shows the previously mentioned \"refrain–quatrain–refrain\" structure. In this case, the several repetitions of the refrain constitute a true \"montuno.\"\n\nRefrain: Yo he nacido para ti nengón, yo he nacido para ti nengón, yo he nacido para ti Nengón… (I was born for you Nengón…)\n\nThe \"Nengón\" is considered a Proto-Son, precursor of the Changüí and also of the Oriental Son. Its main characteristic is the alternance of improvised verses between a soloist and a choir. The Nengón is played with Tres, Guitar, Güiro and Tingotalango or Tumbandera.\n\nChangüí is a type of son from the eastern provinces (area of Santiago de Cuba and Guantánamo), formerly known as Oriente. It shares relevant characteristics with the Oriental Son in regard to rhythms, instruments and choral refrains; and at the same time it shows certain original elements.\n\nChangüí exists today in the form of half-a-dozen small groups, mostly from Guantanamo. The instrumentation is similar to that of the early Son groups who set up in Havana before 1920. These son groups, for example, the early Sexteto Boloña and Sexteto Habanero, used either marimbulas or botijas as bass instruments before they changed over to the double bass, musically a more flexible instrument.\n\nIt is an open question whether today Changüí is still a genuinely distinctive music, or simply an archaic form of Son artificially preserved by state support. Some modern orchestras, such as Orquesta Revé, have claimed Changüí as their main influence. Whether this is accurate, or not, is unclear.\n\nWe can also find in Isla de Pinos, at the opposite Western side of the Island a primeval Proto-Son called Sucu-Sucu, which also shows the same structure of the Oriental Proto-Sones. According to Maria Teresa Linares, In the Sucu-Sucu the music is similar to a Son Montuno in its formal, melodic, instrumental and harmonic structure. A soloist alternates with a choir and improvises on a quatrain or a \"décima.\" The instrumental section is introduced by the Tres, gradually joined by the other instruments. The introduction of eight measures is followed by the refrain by the choir that alternates with the soloist several times.\n\nIn the 19th century here grew up in Santiago de Cuba a group of itinerant musicians, troubadors, who moved around earning their living by singing and playing the guitar. They were of great importance as composers, and their songs have been transcribed for all genres of Cuban music\n\nPepe Sánchez, born José Sánchez (1856–1918), is known as the father of the \"trova\" style and the creator of the Cuban bolero. He had no formal training in music. With remarkable natural talent, he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost for ever, though some two dozen or so survive because friends and disciples transcribed them. His first bolero, \"Tristezas\", is still remembered today. He also created advertisement jingles before radio was born. He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed him.\nThe first, and one of the longest-lived, was Sindo Garay (1867–1968). He was an outstanding composer of trova songs, and his best have been sung and recorded many times. Garay was also musically illiterate – in fact, he only taught himself the alphabet at 16 – but in his case not only were scores recorded by others, but there are recordings. Garay settled in Havana in 1906, and in 1926 joined Rita Montaner and others to visit Paris, spending three months there. He broadcast on radio, made recordings and survived into modern times. He used to say \"Not many men have shaken hands with both José Martí and Fidel Castro!\"\n\nJosé 'Chicho' Ibáñez (1875–1981) was even longer-lived than Garay. Ibáñez was the first trovador to specialize in the son; he also sang guaguancós and pieces from the abakuá.\n\nThe composer Rosendo Ruiz (1885–1983) was another long-lived trovador. He was the author of a well-known guitar manual. Alberto Villalón (1882–1955), and Manuel Corona (1880–1950) were of similar stature. Garay, Ruiz, Villalón and Corona are known as \"the four greats of the trova\", though the following trovadores are also highly regarded.\n\nPatricio Ballagas (1879–1920); María Teresa Vera (1895–1965), Lorenzo Hierrezuelo (1907–1993), Ñico Saquito (Antonio Fernandez: 1901–1982), Carlos Puebla (1917–1989) and Compay Segundo (Máximo Francisco Repilado Muñoz: 1907–2003) were all great trova musicians. El Guayabero (Faustino Oramas: 1911–2007) was the last of the old trova.\n\nTrova musicians often worked in pairs and trios, some of them exclusively so (Compay Segundo). As the sexteto/septeto/conjunto genre grew many of them joined in the larger groups. And let's not forget the Trio Matamoros, who worked together for most of their lives. Matamoros was one of the greats.\n\nThis is a song and dance form quite different from its Spanish namesake. It originated in the last quarter of the 19th century with the founder of the traditional trova, Pepe Sánchez. He wrote the first bolero, \"Tristezas\", which is still sung today. The bolero has always been a staple part of the trova musician's repertoire.\nOriginally, there were two sections of 16 bars in 2/4 time separated by an instrumental section on the Spanish guitar called the \"pasacalle\". The bolero proved to be exceptionally adaptable, and led to many variants. Typical was the introduction of sychopation leading to the bolero-moruno, bolero-beguine, bolero-mambo, bolero-cha. The bolero-son became for several decades the most popular rhythm for dancing in Cuba, and it was this rhythm that the international dance community picked up and taught as the wrongly-named 'rumba'.\n\nThe Cuban bolero was exported all over the world, and is still popular. Leading composers of the bolero were Sindo Garay, Rosendo Ruiz, Carlos Puebla, and Agustín Lara (Mexico).\n\n\"Canción\" means 'song' in Spanish. It is a popular genre of Latin American music, particularly in Cuba, where many of the compositions originate. Its roots lie in Spanish, French and Italian popular song forms. Originally highly stylized, with \"intricate melodies and dark, enigmatic and elaborate lyrics\" The canción was democratized by the trova movement in the latter part of the 19th century, when it became a vehicle for the aspirations and feelings of the population. Canción gradually fused with other forms of Cuban music, such as the bolero.\n\nThe waltz (\"El vals\") arrived in Cuba by 1814. It was the first dance in which couples were not linked by a communal sequence pattern. It was, and still is, danced in 3/4 time with the accent on the first beat. It was originally thought scandalous because couples faced each other, held each other in the 'closed' hold, and, so to speak, ignored the surrounding community. The waltz entered all countries in the Americas; its relative popularity in 19th-century Cuba is hard to estimate.\n\nIndigenous Cuban dances did not use the closed hold with couples dancing independently until the danzón later in the century, though the guaracha might be an earlier example. The waltz has another characteristic: it is a 'travelling' dance, with couples moving round the arena. In Latin dances, progressive movement of dancers is unusual, but does occur in the conga, the samba and the tango.\n\nThe \"Tropical waltz\" was performed in a slower tempo and frequently included a sung melody with a text. Those texts usually referred to the beauties of the Cuban countryside, the longing of the Siboneyes (Cuban aboriginee) and other creole themes. With accents on its three beats, its melody was fluid and composed of equal value notes. It was similar to many other songs in which the melody was treated in a syllabic way, where the first beat was not stressed by a brief anacrusis but had a tendency to move toward the second beat like in the peasant (guajiro) song.\n\nSon cubano is a style of music and dance that originated in Cuba and gained worldwide popularity during the 1930s. Son combines the structure and traits of the Spanish canción with Afro-Cuban stylistic and percussion instruments elements. The Cuban Son is one of the most influential and widespread forms of Latin American music: its derivatives and fusions, especially salsa, have spread across the world.\n\nThe Son, said Cristóbal Díaz, is the most important genre of Cuban music, and the least studied. It can fairly be said that son is to Cuba what the tango is to Argentina, or the samba to Brazil. In addition, it is perhaps the most flexible of all forms of Latin-American music. Its great strength is its fusion between European and African musical traditions. Its most characteristic instruments are the Cuban instrument known as the \"tres\", and the well-known double-headed bongó; these are present from the start to the present day. Also typical are the claves, the Spanish guitar, the double bass (replacing the early botija or marímbula), early on the cornet or trumpet and finally the piano.\n\nIn spite of a traditional tendency to attribute the origin of Cuban Son to the Eastern region of Cuba (Oriente), most recently, some musicologists have shown a more inclusive stance. Although Alejo Carpentier, Emilio Grenet and Cristóbal Díaz Ayala support the \"Eastern origin\" theory, Argeliers León doesn't mention anything about it in his pivotal work \"Del Canto y el Tiempo\", as well as María Teresa Linares in \"The Music between Cuba and Spain.\" Ramadamés Giro states about this subject: \"If Son was an artistic phenomenon that was developing since the second half of the 19th century – and not just in the old Oriente (Eastern) province -, it is logical to suppose, but not to affirm, that long before 1909 it was heard in the Capital City (Havana) because of the aforementioned reasons...\"\n\nIt was in Havana where the encounter of the rural rumba and the urban rumba, that had been developing separately during the second half of the 19th century, took place. The guaracheros and rumberos that used to play with the Tiple and the Guiro finally met other Rumberos that sang and danced accompanied by the wooden box (cajón) and the Cuban Clave, and the result was the fusion of both styles in a new genre called Son. Around 1910 the Son most likely adopted the clave rhythm from the Havana-based rumba, which had been developed in the late 19th century in Havana and Matanzas.\n\nThe mass popularization of Son music led to an increased valorization of Afro-Cuban street culture and of the artists who created it. It also opened the door for other music genres with Afro-Cuban roots to become popular in Cuba and throughout the world.\n\nThe history of jazz in Cuba was obscured for many years, but it has become clear that its history in Cuba is virtually as long as its history in the US.\n\nMuch more is now known about early Cuban jazz bands, but a full assessment is plagued by the lack of recordings. Migrations and visits to and from the US and the mutual exchange of recordings and sheet music kept musicians in the two countries in touch. In the first part of the 20th century, there were close relations between musicians in Cuba and those in New Orleans. The orchestra leader in the famous Tropicana Club, Armando Romeu Jr, was a leading figure in the post-World War II development of Cuban jazz. The phenomenon of cubop and the jam sessions in Havana and New York organized by Cachao created genuine fusions that influence musicians today.\n\nA key historian of early Cuban jazz is Leonardo Acosta. Others have explored the history of jazz and Latin jazz more from the U.S. perspective.\n\nThe Jazz Band Sagua was founded in Sagua la Grande in 1914 by Pedro Stacholy (director & piano). Members: Hipólito Herrera (trumpet); Norberto Fabelo (cornet); Ernesto Ribalta (flute & sax); Humberto Domínguez (violin); Luciano Galindo (trombone); Antonio Temprano (tuba); Tomás Medina (drum kit); Marino Rojo (güiro). For fourteen years they played at the \"Teatro Principal de Sagua\". Stacholy studied under Antonio Fabré in Sagua, and completed his studies in New York, where he stayed for three years.\n\nThe Cuban Jazz Band was founded in 1922 by Jaime Prats in Havana. The personnel included his son Rodrigo Prats on violin, the great flautist Alberto Socarrás on flute and saxophone and Pucho Jiménez on slide trombone. The line-up would probably have included double bass, kit drum, banjo, cornet at least. Earlier works cited this as the first jazz band in Cuba, but evidently there were earlier groups.\n\nIn 1924 Moisés Simons (piano) founded a group which played on the roof garden of the Plaza Hotel in Havana, and consisted of piano, violin, two saxes, banjo, double bass, drums and timbales. Its members included Virgilio Diago (violin); Alberto Soccarás (alto saz, flute); José Ramón Betancourt (tenor sax); Pablo O'Farrill (d. bass). In 1928, still at the same venue, Simons hired Julio Cueva, a famous trumpeter, and Enrique Santiesteban, a future media star, as vocalist and drummer. These were top instrumentalists, attracted by top fees of $8 a day.\n\nDuring the 1930s, several bands played Jazz in Havana, such as those of Armando Romeu, Isidro Pérez, Chico O'Farrill and Germán Lebatard. Their most important contribution was its own instrumental format itself, which introduced the typical Jazz sonority to the Cuban audience. Another important element within this process were the arrangements of Cuban musicians such as Romeu, O'Farrill, Bebo Valdés, Peruchín Jústiz and Leopoldo \"Pucho\" Escalante.\n\nAfro-Cuban jazz is the earliest form of Latin jazz and mixes Afro-Cuban clave-based rhythms with jazz harmonies and techniques of improvisation. Afro-Cuban jazz first emerged in the early 1940s, with the Cuban musicians Mario Bauza and Frank Grillo \"Machito\" in the band Machito and his Afro-Cubans, based in New York City. In 1947 the collaborations of bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie with Cuban percussionist Chano Pozo brought Afro-Cuban rhythms and instruments, most notably the tumbadora and the bongo, into the East Coast jazz scene. Early combinations of jazz with Cuban music, such as Dizzy's and Pozo's \"Manteca\" and Charlie Parker's and Machito's \"Mangó Mangüé\", were commonly referred to as \"Cubop\", short for Cuban bebop... During its first decades, the Afro-Cuban jazz movement was stronger in the United States than in Cuba itself. In the early 1970s, the Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna and later Irakere brought Afro-Cuban jazz into the Cuban music scene, influencing new styles such as songo.\n\nIn 1930, Don Azpiazú had the first million-selling record of Cuban music: \"The Peanut Vendor\" (El Manisero), with Antonio Machín as the singer. This number had been orchestrated and included in N.Y. theatre by Azpiazú before recording, which no doubt helped with the publicity. The Lecuona Cuban Boys became the best-known Cuban touring ensemble: they were the ones who first used the conga drum in their conjunto, and popularized the conga as a dance. Xavier Cugat at the Waldorf Astoria was highly influential. In 1941 Desi Arnaz popularized the comparsa drum (similar to the conga) in the U.S with his performances of Babalú. There was a real 'rumba craze' at the time. Later, Mario Bauza and Machito set up in New York and Miguelito Valdés also arrived there.\n\nIn the 1940s, Chano Pozo formed part of the bebop revolution in jazz, playing conga with Dizzy Gillespie and Machito in New York City. Cuban jazz had started much earlier, in Havana, in the period 1910–1930.\nArsenio Rodríguez, one of Cuba's most famous tres players and conjunto leaders, emphasised the \"son\"'s African roots by adapting the \"guaguancó\" style, and by adding a cowbell and conga to the rhythm section. He also expanded the role of the tres as a solo instrument.\n\nIn the late 1930s and 40s, the danzonera Arcaño y sus Maravillas incorporated more syncopation and added a montuno (as in son), transforming the music played by charanga orchestras.\n\nThe big band era arrived in Cuba in the 1940s, and became a dominant format that survives. Two great arranger-bandleaders deserve special credit for this, Armando Romeu Jr. and Damaso Perez Prado. Armando Romeu Jr. led the \"Tropicana Cabaret\" orchestra for 25 years, starting in 1941. He had experience playing with visiting American jazz groups as well as a complete mastery of Cuban forms of music. In his hands the Tropicana presented not only Afrocuban and other popular Cuban music, but also Cuban jazz and American big band compositions. Later he conducted the \"Orquesta Cubana de Musica Moderna\".\n\nDamaso Perez Prado had a number of hits, and sold more 78s than any other Latin music of the day. He took over the role of pianist/arranger for the Orquesta \"Casino de la Playa\" in 1944, and immediately began introducing new elements into its sound. The orchestra began to sound more Afrocuban, and at the same time Prado took influences from Stravinsky, Stan Kenton and elsewhere. By the time he left the orchestra in 1946 he had put together the elements of his big band mambo.: \"Above all, we must point out the work of Perez Prado as an arranger, or better yet, composer and arranger, and his clear influence on most other Cuban arrangers from then on.\"\n\nBenny Moré, considered by many as the greatest Cuban singer of all time, was in his heyday in the 1950s. He had an innate musicality and fluid tenor voice, which he colored and phrased with great expressivity. Although he could not read music, Moré was a master of all the genres, including son montuno, mambo, guaracha, guajira, cha cha cha, afro, canción, guaguancó, and bolero. His orchestra, the Banda Gigante, and his music, was a development – more flexible and fluid in style – of the Perez Prado orchestra, which he sang with in 1949–1950.\n\nThree great innovations based on Cuban music hit the US after World War II: the first was Cubop, the latest latin jazz fusion. In this, Mario Bauza and the Machito orchestra on the Cuban side and Dizzy Gillespie on the American side were prime movers. The rumbustious conguero Chano Pozo was also important, for he introduced jazz musicians to basic Cuban rhythms. Cuban jazz has continued to be a significant influence.\n\nThe mambo first entered the United States around 1950, though ideas had been developing in Cuba and Mexico City for some time. The mambo as understood in the United States and Europe was considerably different from the danzón-mambo of Orestes \"Cachao\" Lopez, which was a danzon with extra syncopation in its final part. The mambo—which became internationally famous—was a big band product, the work of Perez Prado, who made some sensational recordings for RCA in their new recording studios in Mexico City in the late 1940s. About 27 of those recordings had Benny Moré as the singer, though the best sellers were mainly instrumentals. The big hits included \"Que rico el mambo\" (Mambo Jambo); \"Mambo No. 5\"; \"Mambo #8\"; \"Cherry Pink (and Apple Blossom White)\". The later (1955) hit \"Patricia\" was a mambo/rock fusion. Mambo of the Prado kind was more a descendent of the son and the guaracha than the danzón. In the U.S. the mambo craze lasted from about 1950 to 1956, but its influence on the bugaloo and salsa that followed it was considerable.\nViolinist Enrique Jorrín invented the chachachá in the early 1950s. This was developed from the danzón by increased syncopation. The chachachá became more popular outside Cuba when the big bands of Perez Prado and Tito Puente produced arrangements that attracted American and European audiences.\n\nAlong with \"Nuyoricans\" Ray Barretto and Tito Puente and others, several waves of Cuban immigrants introduced their ideas into US music. Among these was Celia Cruz, a guaracha singer. Others were active in Latin jazz, such as percussionist Patato Valdés of the Cuban-oriented \"Tipíca '73\", linked to the Fania All-Stars. Several former members of Irakere have also become highly successful in the US, among them Paquito D'Rivera and Arturo Sandoval. Tata Güines, a famous conguero, moved to New York City in 1957, playing with jazz players such as Dizzy Gillespie, Maynard Ferguson, and Miles Davis at Birdland. As a percussionist, he performed with Josephine Baker and Frank Sinatra. He returned to Cuba in 1959 after Fidel Castro came to power in the Cuban Revolution, which he helped fund with contributions from his earnings as a musician.\n\nMambo is a musical genre and dance style that developed originally in Cuba. The word \"Mambo\", similarly to other afroamerican musical denominations as conga, milonga, bomba, tumba, samba, bamba, bamboula, tambo, tango, cumbé, cumbia and candombe, denote an African origin, particularly from Congo, due to the presence of certain characteristic combinations of sounds, such as mb, ng and nd, which belong to the Niger-Congo linguistic complex.\n\nThe earliest roots of the Cuban Mambo can be traced to the \"Danzón de Nuevo Ritmo\" (Danzón with a new rhythm) made popular by the orchestra \"Arcaño y sus Maravillas\" conducted by famous bandleader Antonio Arcaño. He was the first to denominate a section of the popular Cuban Danzón as a \"Mambo.\" It was Arcaño's cellist, Orestes López, who created the first Danzón called \"Mambo\" (1938). In this piece, some syncopated motives, taken from the Son style, were combined with improvised flute passages.\n\nPianist and arranger from Matanzas, Cuba, Dámaso Pérez Prado (1927) established his residence in Havana at the beginning of the 1940s and began to work at night clubs and orchestras, such as Paulina Alvarez's and Casino de La Playa. In 1949 he traveled to Mexico looking for job opportunities and achieved great success with a new style, to which he assigns a name that had been already utilized by Antonio Arcaño, the \"Mambo.\"\n\nPerez Prado's style differed from the previous \"Mambo\" concept. The new style possessed a greater influence from the North-American Jazz band music, and an expanded instrumentation consisting of four or five trumpets, four of five saxophones, double bass, drum set, maracas, cowbell, congas and bongoes. The new \"Mambo\" included a catchy counterpoint between the trumpets and the saxophones, that impulsed the body to move along with the rhythm, stimulated at the end of each musical phrase by a characteristic deep throat sound expression.\n\nPrado's recordings were meant for the Latin American and U.S. Latino markets, but some of his most celebrated mambos, such as \"Mambo No. 5\" and \"Que Rico el Mambo\", quickly crossed over to the United States.\n\nChachachá is a genre of Cuban music. It has been a popular dance music which developed from the Danzón-mambo in the early 1950s, and became widely popular throughout the entire world.\n\nChachachávis a Cuban music genre whose creation has been traditionally attributed to Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrín, which began his career playing for the charanga band Orquesta América.\n\nAccording to the testimony of Enrique Jorrín, he composed some \"Danzones\" in which the musician of the orchestra had to sing short refrains, and this style was very successful. In the Danzón \"Constancia\" he introduced some montunos and the audience was motivated to join in singing the refrains. Jorrín also asked the members of the orchestra to sing in unison so the lyrics may be heard more clearly and achieve a greater impact in the audience. That way of singing also helped to mask the poor singing skills of the orchestra members.\n\nSince its inception, Chachachá music had a close relationship with the dancer's steps. The well-known name Chachachá came into being with the help of the dancers at the Silver Star Club in Havana. When the dance was coupled to the rhythm of the music, it became evident that the dancer's feet were making a peculiar sound as they grazed the floor on three successive beats. It was like an onomatopoeia that sounded as: Chachachá. From this peculiar sound, a music genre was born which motivated people from around the world to dance at its catchy rhythm.\n\nAccording to Olavo ALén: \"During the 1950s, Chachachá maintained its popularity thanks to the efforts of many Cuban composers who were familiar with the technique of composing \"danzones\" and who unleashed their creativity on the Chachachá\", such as Rosendo Ruiz, Jr. (\"Los Marcianos\" and \"Rico Vacilón\"), Félix Reina (\"Dime Chinita,\" \"Como Bailan Cha-cha-chá los Mexicanos\"), Richard Egűes (\"El Bodeguero\" and \"La Cantina\") and Rafael Lay (\"Cero Codazos, Cero Cabezazos\").\n\nThe Chachachá was first presented to the public through the instrumental medium of the \"charanga,\" a typical Cuban dance band format made up of a flute, strings, piano, bass and percussion. The popularity of the Chachachá also revived the popularity of this kind of orchestra.\n\nFilin was a Cuban fashion of the 1940s and 1950s, influenced by popular music in the US. The word is derived from \"feeling\". It describes a style of post-microphone jazz-influenced romantic song (crooning). Its Cuban roots were in the bolero and the canción. Some Cuban quartets, such as Cuarteto d'Aida and Los Zafiros, modelled themselves on U.S. close-harmony groups. Others were singers who had heard Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Nat King Cole. A house in Havana, where the trovador Tirso Díaz lived, became a meeting-place for singers and musicians interested in filin such as: Luis Yañez, César Portillo de la Luz, José Antonio Méndez, Niño Rivera, José Antonio Ñico Rojas, Elena Burke, Froilán, Aida Diestro and Frank Emilio Flynn. Here lyricists and singers could meet arrangers, such as Bebo Valdés, El Niño Rivera (Andrés Hechavarria), Peruchín (Pedro Justiz), and get help to develop their work. Filin singers included César Portillo de la Luz, José Antonio Méndez, who spent a decade in Mexico from 1949 to 1959, Frank Domínguez, the blind pianist Frank Emilio Flynn, and the great singers of boleros Elena Burke and the still-performing Omara Portuondo, who both came from the Cuarteto d'Aida. The filin movement originally had a place every afternoon on \"Radio Mil Diez\". Some of its most prominent singers, such as Pablo Milanés, took up the banner of the Nueva Trova at a later time.\n\nModern Cuban music is known for its relentless mixing of genres. For example, the 1970s saw Los Irakere use batá in a big band setting; this became known as son-batá or batá-rock. Later artists created the mozambique, which mixed conga and mambo, and batá-rumba, which mixed rumba and batá drum music. Mixtures including elements of hip hop, jazz and rock and roll are also common, like in Habana Abierta's rockoson.\n\nThe triumph of the Cuban Revolution in 1959 signalled the emigration of many musicians to Puerto Rico, Florida and New York, and in Cuba artists and their work came under the protection (and control) of the Socialist state, and the monopoly state-owned recording company EGREM. The Castro government abolished copyright laws in Cuba, closed many of the venues where popular music used to be played (e.g. night clubs), and so indirectly threw many musicians out of work. This undoubtedly had deleterious effects on the evolution of popular music and dance.\nMany young musicians now studied classical music and not popular music. All musicians employed by the state were given academic courses in music. In Cuba, the Nueva Trova movement (including Pablo Milanés) reflected the new leftist ideals. The state took over the lucrative Tropicana Club, which continued as a popular attraction for foreign tourists until 1968, when it was closed along with many other music venues (and later reopened with the rebirth of tourism). Tourism was almost non-existent for three decades. Traditional Cuban music could be found in local Casas de la Trova. Musicians, if in work, were full-time and paid by the state after graduating from a conservatory. The collapse of the USSR in 1991, and the loss of its support for Cuba changed the situation quite a bit. Tourism became respectable again, and so did popular music for their entertainment. Musicians were even allowed to tour abroad and earn a living outside the state-run system.\n\nFamous artists from the Cuban exile include Celia Cruz and the whole conjunto she sang with, the Sonora Matancera. 'Patato' (Carlos Valdes), Cachao, La Lupe, Arturo Sandoval, Willy Chirino, Hansel y Raul, La Palabra, Paquito D'Rivera, Bebo Valdés and Gloria Estefan are some others. Many of these musicians, especially Cruz, became closely associated with the anti-revolutionary movement, and as 'unpersons' have been omitted from the standard Cuban reference books, and their subsequent musical recordings are never on sale in Cuba.\n\nSalsa was the fourth innovation based on Cuban music to hit the US, and differed in that it was initially developed in the US, not in Cuba. Because Cuba has so many indigenous types of music there has always been a problem in marketing the 'product' abroad to people who did not understand the differences between rhythms that, to a Cuban, are quite distinct. So, twice in the 20th century, a kind of product label was developed to solve this problem. The first occasion was in the 1930s after \"The Peanut Vendor\" became an international success. It was called a 'rumba' even though it really had nothing to do with genuine rumba: the number was obviously a son pregon. The label 'rumba' was used outside Cuba for years as a catch-all for Cuban popular music.\nThe second occasion happened during the period 1965–1975 in New York City, as musicians of Cuban and Puerto-Rican origin combined to produce the great music of the post Cha-cha-cha period. This music acquired the label of 'salsa'. No-one really knows how this happened, but everyone recognised what a benefit it was to have a common label for son, mambo, guaracha, guajira, guaguancó, etc. Cubans and non Cubans, such as Tito Puente, Rubén Blades and many experts of the Cuban music and salsa have always said \"Salsa is just another name for Cuban, music. Tito Puentes once said, now they call it Salsa, later they may call it Stir Fry, but to me it will alway be Cuban Music\"; but over time salsa bands worked in other influences. For example, in the late 1960s Willie Colón developed numbers that made use of Brazilian rhythms. New York radio programmes offered 'salsarengue' as a further combination. You look at a band of the 1940s playing Cuban music and you will see the same exact instruments in Salsa Music. Later still 'Salsa romantica' was the label for an especially sugary type of bolero. Even when, Benny Moré, Perez Prado the greatest Sonero that ever existed, was singing Boleros with a salsa cadence in the 1940s. It was not until the 1950s that Cuban music became popular for Puerto Rican bands. Plena, Bomba an other styles or music were popular at the time in Puerto Rico. Many famous Puerto Rican musicians went to learn the music styles of Cubans in the 1930s and 1940s, and it was not until the arrival of Castro in 1959 and the Cuban music stopped its exportation to the world, that Puerto Ricans in New York were able to be greatly noticed, but what is known as Salsa today, was brought to New York in the 1920s and 1930s by Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo, this last one was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie as he was one of the greatest percussionist that ever lived.\n\nThe question of whether or not salsa is anything more than Cuban music has been argued over for more than thirty years. Initially, not much difference could be seen. Later it became clear that not only was New York salsa different from popular music in Cuba, but salsa in Venezuela, Colombia and other countries could also be distinguished. It also seems clear that salsa has receded from the great position it achieved in the late 1970s. The reasons for this are also much disputed.\n\nParalleling nueva canción in Latin America is the Cuban Nueva trova, which dates from about 1967/68, after the Cuban Revolution. It differed from the traditional trova, not because the musicians were younger, but because the content was, in the widest sense, political. Nueva trova is defined by its connection with Castro's revolution, and by its lyrics, which attempt to escape the banalities of life by concentrating on socialism, injustice, sexism, colonialism, racism and similar issues. Silvio Rodríguez and Pablo Milanés became the most important exponents of this style. Carlos Puebla and Joseíto Fernández were long-time old trova singers who added their weight to the new regime, but of the two only Puebla wrote special pro-revolution songs.\n\nNueva trova had its heyday in the 1970s, but was already declining before the fall of the Soviet Union. Examples of non-political styles in the nueva trova movement can be found, for example, Liuba María Hevia whose lyrics are focused on more traditional subjects such as love and solitude, sharing with the rest a highly poetical style. On the other side of the spectrum, Carlos Varela is famous in Cuba for his open criticism of some aspects of Castro's revolution.\n\nThe nueva trova, initially so popular, suffered both inside Cuba, perhaps from a growing disenchantment with one-party rule, and externally, from the vivid contrast with the Buena Vista Social Club film and recordings. Audiences round the world have had their eyes opened to the extraordinary charm and musical quality of the older forms of Cuban music. By contrast, topical themes that seemed so relevant in the 1960s and 1970s now seem dry and passé. Even \"Guantanamera\" has been damaged by over-repetition in less skilled hands. All the same, those pieces of high musical and lyrical quality, among which Puebla's \"Hasta siempre, Comandante\" stands out, will probably last as long as Cuba lasts.\n\nSon remains the basis of most popular forms of modern Cuban music. Son is represented by long-standing groups like Septeto Nacional, which was re-established in 1985, Orquesta Aragón, Orquesta Ritmo Oriental and Orquesta Original de Manzanillo. Sierra Maestra, is famous for having sparked a revival in traditional son in the 1980s. Nueva trova still has influence, but the overtly political themes of the 1960s are well out of fashion. Meanwhile, Irakere fused traditional Cuban music with jazz, and groups like NG La Banda, Orishas and Son 14 continued to add new elements to son, especially hip hop and funk, to form timba music; this process was aided by the acquisition of imported electronic equipment. There are still many practitioners of traditional \"son montuno\", such as Eliades Ochoa, who have recorded and toured widely as a result of interest in the \"son montuno\" after the Buena Vista Social Club success. Europe-based Cuban female singer-songwriter Addys Mercedes merged her roots of Son and Filin with elements of urban, rock and pop-music, reaching mainstream airplay charts in Germany.\n\nIn the 1990s, increased interest in world music coincided with the post-Soviet Union \"periodo especial\" in Cuba, during which the economy began opening up to tourism. Orquesta Aragón, Charanga Habanera and Cándido Fabré y su Banda have been long-time players in the charanga scene, and helped form the popular timba scene of the late 1990s. The biggest award in modern Cuban music is the Beny Moré Award.\n\nCubans have never been content to hear their music described as \"salsa\", even though it is crystal clear that this \"was\" a label for their music. Since the early 1990s Timba has been used to describe popular dance music in Cuba, rivaled only lately by Reggaetón. Though derived from the same roots as salsa, Timba has its own characteristics, and is intimately tied to the life and culture of Cuba, and especially Havana.\n\nAs opposed to salsa, whose roots are strictly from Son and the Cuban \"conjunto\" bands of the 1940s and 1950s, Timba represents a synthesis of many folkloric (rumba, guaguancó, batá drumming and the sacred songs of santería.), and popular sources (even taking inspiration from non Afro Cuban musical genres such as rock, jazz and funk). According to Vincenzo Perna, author of \"Timba: The Sound of the Cuban Crisis\", timba needs to be spoken of because of its musical, cultural, social, and political reasons; its sheer popularity in Cuba, its novelty and originality as a musical style, the skill of its practitioners, its relationship with both local traditions and the culture of the black Diaspora, its meanings, and the way its style brings to light the tension points within society. In addition to timbales, timba drummers make use of the drum-set, further distinguishing the sound from that of mainland salsa. The use of synthesised keyboard is also common. Timba songs tend to sound more innovative, experimental and frequently more virtuosic than salsa pieces; horn parts are usually fast, at times even bebop influenced, and stretch to the extreme ranges of all instruments. Bass and percussion patterns are similarly unconventional. Improvisation is commonplace.\n\nSeveral projects gained international attention in the 1990s due to their revival of traditional music styles such as the son cubano of the septeto and the conjunto era. Founded in 1976, Sierra Maestra (band) was one of the first revivalist groups in Cuba. In 1995, Juan de Marcos González, director and tres player of Sierra Maestra, was contacted by Nick Gold (head of World Circuit Records) to record a traditional Cuban album featuring African musicians. In the end, the African musicians could not make it to Havana, so the project became a 100% Cuban affair featuring veteran Cuban musicians such as Rubén González, Ibrahim Ferrer, Compay Segundo and Omara Portuondo. It spawned two bands, both of which involved American guitarist Ry Cooder: Afro-Cuban All Stars and Buena Vista Social Club. Both bands recorded their debut albums, \"A Toda Cuba le Gusta\" and \"Buena Vista Social Club\", respectively, in March 1996. The release of the latter in September 1997 was a true watershed event. The album became a worldwide hit, selling millions of copies and turning established musicians into globally renowned figures.\n\"Buena Vista\" resulted in several follow-up recordings and spawned a film of the same name, as well as tremendous interest in other Cuban groups. In subsequent years, dozens of singers and \"conjuntos\" made recordings for foreign labels and toured internationally.\n\nThe conclusion some have drawn is that the wholesale closure of popular music venues (after the revolution), which threw many musicians out of work, and subsequent control by state committees, damaged the development of Cuban popular music.\n\nHip hop grew steadily more popular in Cuba in the 1980s and 1990s through Cuba's Special Period. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Cuban economy went into decline. Poverty became more widespread and visible in Cuba. In the 1990s, some Cubans started to protest this situation by means of rap and hip-hop. During this period of economic crisis, which the country's poor and black populations especially hard, hip hop became a way for the country's Afro-descended population to embrace their blackness and articulate a demand for racial equality for black people in Cuba. The idea of blackness and black liberation was not always compatible with the goals of the Cuban government, which was still operating under the idea that a raceless society was the correct realization of the Cuban Revolution. When hip-hop emerged, the Cuban government opposed the vulgar image that rappers portrayed, but later accepted that it might be better to have hip-hop under the influence of the Ministry of Culture as an authentic expression of Cuban Culture. Rap music in Cuba is heavily influenced by the country's pre-existing musical traditions, such as salsa and rumba. \n\nIn some ways, hip hop is tolerated by the government of Cuba and performers are provided with venues and equipment by the government. The Cuban rap and hip-hop scene sought out the involvement of the Ministry of Culture in the production and promotion of their music, which would otherwise have been impossible to accomplish. After the Cuban government provided lukewarm endorsement, the Cuban Rap Agency provided the Cuban rap scene, in 2002, with a state-sponsored record label, magazine, and Cuba's own hip-hop festival.\n\nThe government gives rap and hip-hop groups time on mass media outlets in return for hip-hop artists limiting self-expression and presenting the government in a positive way. Rappers who explicitly speak about race or racism in Cuba are still under scrutiny by the government. The government recognizes that hip-hop is growing in Cuba, and would be difficult to eliminate.\n\nLike Spanish reggae from Panama is a new genre for the Cubans but by 2012 was so massively popular that \"the face of Cuban pop music\" was considered to be Cuban reggae (cubatón) singer, Osmani García \"La Voz\". The advent of web software helped to distribute music unofficially. Both lyrics and dance movements have been criticised. Reggaeton musicians such as responded by making songs that defended their music. Despite their efforts, the Ministry of Culture has ruled that reggaeton is not to be used in teaching institutions, parties and at discos, and in 2011 restricted its airplay after massive popularity of García's \"Chupi Chupi\", which referred to oral sex. Other popular cubatón artists include Eddy K and Gente de Zona (\"People from the 'Hood\").\n\n \n\nThe musical interaction between Cuba and the US is ancient. Already in the 18th century, during the Spanish rule of Louisiana (1763–1803), the Havanese orchestras and bands offered concerts in New Orleans and in the 19th century the Cuan contradanza was very popular in the US. At the beginning of the 20th century, the first jazz bands were created in Cuba, in the style of the American groups. The \"Sagua\" Jaz Band was founded in Sagua la Grande in 1914 by Pedro Stacholy (conductor and pianist). The group played during 14 years at the \"Teatro Principal de Sagua\".\n\nThe strong influenece of the American music on the Cuban younger generations gave way to the beginning of the soloists and groups of Rock and roll in Cuba during the 1950s. Many Cuban artists sang versions of American songs translated to Spanish, as it was also happening in Mexico.\n\nThe launching of the group Los LLopis represented the entrance in a new stage for the Cuban music, that of the generation and amplification of the sound by electroacoustic devices; because in the sound composition of this group one can observe a novel element of great importance, the inclusion of an electric guitar.\n\nIn 1961 other artists emerged such as Dany Puga, called the King of Twist, and bands such as Los Satélites, Los Diablos Melódicos and Los Enfermos del Rock, as well as Los Halcones and Los Huracanes from Marianao.\n\nThe vocal quartet Los Zafiros was another successful group from the beginning of the sixties. Founded in 1961, it was influenced by the Doo-Wop style of The Platters, The Diamonds and other American groups, and counted on a repertoire consisting of ballads, calypsos and bossanovas, as well as songs with a slow rock ad bolero rhythms.\n\nAt that time, the popular group Los Astros, led by the singer and guitarist Raúl Gómez, was threatened by pressures exerted by the Fidel Castro regime over the rock groups, which were considered as a form of \"ideological diversionism\" and actively opposed in all its manifesations. Its style, strongly influenced by the Brithish Invasion groups, as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, was labelled as \"deviant\" and consequently repressed without any hesitation. Since then, the Revolutionary government of Cuba began to implement an absolute control over all aspects of the Cuban society, including, of course, all cultural expressions.\n\nAround 1965, the Revolutionary government implemented a strategy to substitute the foreign products that the young people preferred, with others that better matched their official guidelines; and as a result of this strategy, a new radio program called Nocturno was broadcast in 1966, which initial musical theme was \"La chica de la valija\" (Girl with a suitcase) from the Italian sax player Fausto Papetti. The program presented modern songs, giving priority to the European repertoire in Spanish language of soloists and groups such as: Los Mustang, Los Bravos, Los Brincos, Juan y Junior, Rita Pavone, Massiel, Nino Bravo, Leonardo Fabio, Salvatore Adamo and Raphael, and some Cuban groups as Los Zafiros and Los Dan. The ban against rock music was lifted in 1966, but rock fans continued to be marginalized by the communist establishment, and watched over with suspicion as \"counter-revolutionaries\".\n\nActually, rock music began to be heard in Havana during the seventies, in a radio program from Radio Marianao called Buenas Tardes Juventud. That program presented groups such as The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Dave Clark Five, The Animals, Grand Funk, Rare Earth, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Elvis Presley, Neil Sedaka and Paul Anka. At the beginning of the eighties, that radio station joined Radio Ciudad de La Habana.\n\nIn 1979, a three-day music festival called Havana Jam '79 took place at the Karl Marx Theater, in Havana, Cuba, where a group of rock artists that included Billy Joel and Stephen Stills performed.\n\nIn the 1980s, a heavy metal band called Venus was formed by Roberto Armada in Municipio Playa. They achieved much success and created a headbanger following among the Cuban youth. Punk rock was introduced in Cuba in the late 1980s and gained a cult-type following among a minority of the youth.\n\nDuring the nineties, rock and roll in Cuba was still an underground phenomenon. In Havana, the \"Ciudad de La Habana\" radio station presented several programs showing the most recent tendencies on that type of music around the world. Juan Camacho, an old musician and radio host had a morning program called \"Disco Ciudad\". \"El programa de Ramón\" was also a successful radio show. Some bands from that period were Gens, Zeus and Los Tarsons.\n\nIn 2001, the Welsh group Manic Street Preachers was invited to perform in Cuba, and Fidel castro attended its concert along with other government authorities. In 2004, Castro gave a speech honoring the Birthday of John Lennon, whose music, as a member of The Beatles and as a soloist, was banned in Cuba for a very long time. A bronze statue of Lennon was placed in a Havanese well known park, and it became a notoriety because of becoming a victim of constant vandalism from passers by that frequently stole its bronze spectacles.\n\nAt the same time that the government was showing a more indulgent attitude toward the foreign rock groups, as part of an international campaign which purpose was to achieve an opening in the commercial transactions and investments of the US and Europe in Cuba, it continued to implement an inflexible repression against any form of internal dissidence. This was the case of the rocker Gorki Águila and his group Porno para Ricardo. In August 2008, Águila was arrested under charges of dangerousness, a law that allows the authorities to detain people whom they think are likely to commit crimes, even when they have not yet committed them.\n\nMore recently, Rick Wakeman, Sepultura and Audioslave performed in Havana, and The Rolling Stones offered a historic concert that has become the most outstanding rock event since the beginning of the Revolutionary period in 1959.\n\nA new phenomenon occurred in 2013 when several Cuban metal bands begin to emigrate to the United States, creating a parallel scene with the bands Agonizer, Escape, Ancestor, Hipnosis, Suffering Tool and Chlover \n\nThe works below are reliable sources for all aspects of traditional Cuban popular music.

Many of the species are listed as Endangered or Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\nRescued animals at Phnom Tamao can be seen through general park admission, through the wildlife tours organized by Wildlife Alliance, Free the Bears, and independent tour operators.\n\nPhnom Tamao is home to the world's largest group of rescued Malayan sun bears together with a number of Moon bears or Asiatic black bears. The bear sanctuary covers an area of over 10 hectares and is home to more than 130 rescued bears which have been supported by Free the Bears since 1997. The bear sanctuary contains a dedicated classroom for visiting school groups \"The Bear Den\", a visitor centre and number of education zones for general visitors \"The Bear Discovery Centre\" and \"The Bear Discovery Trail\", a children's play area \"The Home of the Wild Things\" and a dedicated research facility \"The Field Station\" for student researchers undertaking projects aimed at improving the welfare of captive bears or promoting conservation of wild bears. Visitors wishing to spend time helping with the care of the bears and seeing behind the scenes of the world's biggest sanctuary for the world's smallest bear can join either the one-day Bear Care Tour (http://www.freethebears.org/index.php/help-the-bears/bear-care-tour) or Free the Bears volunteer programme for longer stays of 1-12 weeks (http://www.freethebears.org/index.php/help-the-bears/volunteer)\n\nElephants at Phnom Tamao have been trained using gentle Positive Reinforcement or Target Training. This means that they will simply not receive their “reward” (pieces of fruit or vegetables) if they do not follow the keeper's verbal command. It is often preferable to train captive elephants because they can then be handled more safely, which means their health can be checked and they can be better cared for.\n\n\"Chhouk\" The youngest male elephant at Phnom Tamao has a prosthetic leg. Chhouk was found wandering alone in the Srepok Wilderness Area in Mondulkiri with a serious leg injury, most likely caused by a snare. The Forestry Administration in cooperation with Wildlife Alliance brought him to PTWRC as he would have died left on his own. Once his foot healed, the Cambodian School of Prosthetics and Orthotics designed Chhouk a prosthetic leg to help him walk normally again. In order to change the prosthesis twice daily, Chhouk is trained with a positive reinforcement rewards-based system.\n\n\"Lucky\" The most charismatic elephant at Phnom Tamao, Lucky is the \"gentle giant\" who has been trained through rewards-based positive reinforcement to respond to 20 different words (in English and Khmer), paint, and dance. Watching and interacting with Lucky has helped endear and engage visitors in the experience of the elephants.\n\nThe Cambodian Forestry Administration assisted by Wildlife Alliance confiscated 7 tigers in a sting operation in Phnom Penh in the year 2000. This was done to demonstrate that tigers could still be illegally purchased in Cambodia, despite the fact that there are now almost none left in the wild. One had been so severely beaten that she died of brain damage. The others were nursed backed to health, quickly responding to the care they received from Wildlife Alliance. The tigers are now kept in pairs in their large, forested enclosures.\n\nAll of the animals living at PTWRC were confiscated from the illegal wildlife trade, victims of habitat loss, donated by a private owner, or rescued in a human-wildlife conflict situation. Most were rescued by the Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team, formed in 2001. The Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team has rescued more than 50,000 live animals and confiscated large quantities of animal parts and other contraband.\n\nThe Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team (WRRT) was established in cooperation with Wildlife Alliance, Cambodia’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery’s Department of Forestry Administration and the Royal Gendarmerie Khmer. WRRT is a 14-member team composed of Forestry Administration officials and Military Police who are mandated to crack down on the illegal wildlife trade throughout Cambodia, tracking down poachers and traffickers, raiding restaurants, markets, and stores, and investigating trafficking networks in cities and along borders. WRRT is a unique law enforcement squad in Southeast Asia, being devoted solely to combating the illegal wildlife trade.\n\nWRRT receives tips from a covert informant network and from the nationwide public hotline number. When WRRT rescues live animals, those that are healthy and suited for the wild are immediately released in an appropriate habitat. Animals that cannot be released because of injuries or trauma are cared for by Wildlife Alliance's Care for Rescued Wildlife team at the Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Center.\n\nWhile Wildlife Alliance provides capacity building with logistical and technical support to WRRT, WRRT also trains teams working for other organizations that are addressing the illegal wildlife trade, both in the manner in which they conduct operations and in animal handling skills. WRRT’s skill in handling and caring for rescued wild animals is such that there are almost never any fatalities, despite the poor conditions in which most traded wildlife is found.\n\nIn 2010 Wildlife Alliance worked with the Cambodian Government to implement ASEAN-WEN (Wildlife Enforcement\nNetwork) in which authorities work with their counterparts in the neighboring countries to try to stop the cross-border trade.\n\nUntil 2001, Cambodia’s most prominent markets openly displayed rare animals for purchase and wildlife meats were commonplace on restaurant menus. Today wildlife dishes are no longer available at 90% of restaurants in the nation’s capital. Today the illegal wildlife trade is predominantly run by the same dangerous groups behind drug and weapons trafficking.\n\nWhen illegal traders are caught by the Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team (WRRT), their contraband and equipment are confiscated. Traders are handed over to the courts, who impose prison terms and fines. Fines can be considerable and amounts of money have risen steadily as officials realize the importance of implementing laws protecting wild animals. This acts as a great deterrent, which ultimately makes it unprofitable for traders to stay in business. The Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team is not a forest patrol unit but a task force with a nationwide mandate that deals with the illegal trade, usually conducted from towns and cities. It does not address subsistence hunting but mostly the lucrative business conducted by middle men, who sell live and dead wild animals to restaurants and medical stores or export wildlife for consumption in neighboring countries.\n\nRescued animals that are deemed suitable for release into the wild are relocated to a Wildlife Rehabilitation Station (WRS) created by Wildlife Alliance in Koh Kong Province, Cambodia. Here the animals are moved to a forested enclosure within an appropriate area of habitat where they are to be released. They are cared for within the enclosure for many months in order to become familiar with the area and relearn their wild instinctual behavior. When the animals are ready for release, the door to the enclosure is left open and the animals are free to leave at will. Wildlife Alliance continues to provide hands-off assistance and supplementary food at the enclosure location for as long as necessary.\n\nReleased animals are then monitored using various methods such as visual observation, track identification, camera traps, and radio telemetry to ensure release strategies are successful and the animals are able to survive. Animals are familiarized with their new habitat before release and given support as they grow comfortable with their new skills in the wild. Sun bears, binturong (\"bear cats\"), macaques, and birds are just a few of the animals that have begun the second phase of their life here. The priority for the Care for Rescued Wildlife Program is to continue developing and implementing rehabilitation and release programs for many of the rescued animals, while continuing to feed and care for the animals that need to call PTWRC home.\n\n"}

The show involves a young couple's weekend at a lakeside cabin. Mamet banned the play from being put on in New York in 1985, but lifted the ban unexpectedly in 1996 for actress Danielle Kwatinetz.\n\nThe play is about a couple, Nick and Ruth, spending a night at a house in the country. They push their relationship to the breaking point in a night of stories and fights, only to rediscover their need for one another in the morning.\n\nThe play takes place on the front porch of Nick's family's summerhouse, where he and Ruth are spending the night. \"The Woods\" ends with a bed-time story, but the final reconciliation remains uncomfortably tempered by the violent core we now know to be hiding beneath the soothing words.\n\nThe original production premiered on November 11, 1977 produced by the St. Nicholas Theatre Company in Chicago, and was directed by Mamet. It starred Patti Lupone and Peter Weller. Set design was by Michael Merritt, lighting by Robert Christen, graphic design by Lois Grimm, and the production was presented in arrangement with Ken Marsolais.\n\nThe play's New York City premiere was in 1979, Off-Broadway at the Public Theater, where it was produced by Joseph Papp, directed by Ulu Grosbard, and starred Chris Sarandon and Christine Lahti. Set design was by John Lee Beatty, costume design by Robert Wojewodski, and lighting design by Jennifer Tipton.\n\nIn 1982, Mamet directed an Off-Broadway revival of \"The Woods\" at the Second Stage Theatre, again starring Patti Lupone and Peter Weller.\n\nIn 1985, Mamet imposed a ban on New York productions of the play. In December 1996, Mamet unexpectedly lifted the ban, and granted rights to young producer and actor Danielle Kwatinetz. This resulted a special four-night Off-Off-Broadway engagement at the Producer’s Club in January 1997, starring Danielle Kwatinetz and Eric Martin Brown, and directed by David Travis. Lighting design was by Dan and Chris Scully, and set design was by Devorah Herbert.\n\n\"The Woods\" examines the archetypal differences and interplay between men and women. Paul Taylor in \"The Independent\" writes that \"\"The Woods\" ... was expressly written to examine the question 'why don't men and women get along?'\"\n\nIn the \"Chicago Reader\", Diana Spinrad writes: \nSarah Lansdale Stevenson notes the play's \"precision of ... language,\" \"rhythm and repetition,\" \"intricate image patterns,\" and \"elegant simplicity of image patterns,\" and observes that:\nAnd Mamet opines that, \"It is a dreamy play, full of the symbology of dream and the symbology of myth, which are basically the same thing.\"\n\nAlthough \"The Woods\" has always maintained a certain following, critical reception of the play has tended to be indifferent or harsh.

{"id": "1502312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1502312", "title": "Yoshi Touch &amp; Go", "text": "Yoshi Touch &amp; Go\n\nYoshi Touch & Go, known in Japan as , is a video game that was developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. It debuted in Japan on January 27, 2005, in North America on March 14, 2005, and in Europe on May 6, 2005. As of August 2007, the game sold 197,337 copies in Japan. \"Yoshi Touch & Go\" was produced by Takashi Tezuka and directed by Hiroyuki Kimura. It was one of the launch titles for the DS in Japan. The game was released on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2015.\n\nThe game revolves around Yoshi and Baby Mario/Baby Luigi. Its graphical style and cast of characters originate from \"Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island\". The game heavily utilizes the DS's touch screen capabilities, and makes use of the microphone as well. The challenge in the game comes from replaying the same modes over and over to get the best possible score, similar to the classic arcade games of the 1980s. Therefore, the difficulty of the game is based primarily on improving one's own skill.\n\nThe game begins with three different gameplay modes: \"Score Attack\", \"Marathon\", and the \"multiplayer vs. mode\". Additionally, the player can unlock \"Time Attack\" and \"Challenge modes\" by getting the high score in the \"Score Attack\" and \"Marathon\" modes. When the high score on the two new modes is achieved, the mini-game \"Balloon Trip\" is unlocked. There are two basic level types: a vertical level, where the player must lead Baby Mario through the sky safely to the ground; and a side-scrolling level, where the player takes control over different colored Yoshis, carrying Baby Mario on their back.\n\nAs opposed to the earlier \"Yoshi\" games, in \"Yoshi Touch & Go\" the player cannot take direct control over the characters. Instead, the Yoshis move from the left to the right automatically at a certain speed. However, the player can draw lines on the lower screen with the stylus, which creates clouds that will support a character. This attribute allows to create alternate routes to avoid enemies and obstacles. If the drawn clouds are impeding progress, they disappear by blowing into the microphone. Enemies can be dispatched by drawing circles on them, which puts most of them into a bubble. In the side-scrolling level, a Yoshi can make an egg out of fruits by leading them to its mouth. By tapping on the screen, the Yoshi will launch an egg in that direction, which is useful for killing enemies or collecting coins and fruits. By tapping on a Yoshi himself, the player can make him jump, and tapping him again while he's in midair will cause him to do a flutter-kick jump.\n\nThe Nintendo DS's two screens act as one tall screen, whereas the player can only create clouds on the lower one. However, by throwing eggs in the upper screen it is possible to collect coins or fruits from there. An exception provides the wireless \"multiplayer vs. mode\", where only the lower screen shows the player's view, while the upper screen shows that of the enemy. In the multiplayer, the goal is to be faster than the enemy. By clearing out enemies on the own screen, the player can cause spiky obstacles on the opponent's screen.\n\nIn some modes, there is a star point counter. Once this reaches 100, a Super Star will appear. If Yoshi touches it or the player drags it to Yoshi, Baby Mario will temporarily become Super Baby Mario, who is considerably faster than Yoshi and has unlimited stars (instead of eggs) to throw. The star points will then return to zero. Also, by feeding fruits to Yoshi a certain number of eggs will be replenished. The number of replenished eggs consists of the fruit (for instance, an apple only refills one egg, while melons refill twenty).\n\nThe color of Yoshi that Baby Mario rides depends on the player's score in the vertical falling part of the game. If the player gets 60 points, he will ride a light blue Yoshi, and then the color will go up a level for every other 20 points scored (for instance, pink Yoshi at 80 points, blue Yoshi at 100 points, etc.). The only two exceptions are white and orange Yoshi: In Marathon mode, when Baby Mario changes Yoshis, depending on the player's performance he might start riding a white Yoshi, who will switch to black Yoshi, unless it's at the 10,000 meters mark, in which case he will switch over to orange Yoshi. It will then switch to purple Yoshi at 20,000 meters in Marathon. In challenge mode, after the high score is beaten, getting 0 points in the Baby Mario segment of future games will unlock a fast purple Yoshi. The same applies to time attack where a white Yoshi, which has unlimited eggs, can be unlocked.\n\nAccording to director Hiroyuki Kimura and designer Keizo Ohta, \"Yoshi Touch & Go\" was originally planned to be designed for the Nintendo GameCube as \"Balloon Trip\". A demo of the game was first exhibited during the E3 of 2004 and gained positive response. Thereupon, the executives of Nintendo green lighted the project. Shigeru Miyamoto considered that the game would create a bigger impact as a DS title.\n\n\"Yoshi Touch & Go\" was produced by Takashi Tezuka and director by Hiroyuki Kimura. The game's musical score was created by Toru Minegishi, Asuka Ohta, and Kazumi Totaka. Baby Mario and Baby Luigi were voiced by Charles Martinet while the voice-over of the Yoshis was done by Totaka, including the 19-note song he did.\n\nThe game was generally well received, though not as positively as earlier games of the \"Yoshi\" series, such as \"Yoshi's Island\". It holds average ratings of 75% at GameRankings and 73/100 at Metacritic. Craig Harris of IGN said it \"is one of the most original and unique games created for the system so far, and it's truly a design that's unlike anything you've played before.\" He especially commended the multiplayer mode and gave the game an 8.8/10. Additionally, it won the IGN Editors' Choice Award on March 11, 2005.\n\nSome reviewers, however, criticised \"Yoshi Touch & Go\" for its lack of storyline and the simple gameplay. GameSpot's Ryan Davis found that he was \"going through the same few levels over and over again\" and thought the multiplayer mode was not very compelling, concluding that although \"the gameplay concepts(...)are quite good,\" the overall package \"simply lacks substance.\" Also, the game gathered negative criticism for its price, which was found too high by some critics. Nevertheless, \"Touch & Go\" was a moderate success, selling 197,337 copies in Japan.\n\n"}
