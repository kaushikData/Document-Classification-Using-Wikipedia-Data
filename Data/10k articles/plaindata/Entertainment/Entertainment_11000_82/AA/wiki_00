Additionally, the Japanese version of the game had a different difficulty curve, different stages, and \"Moby\" (the whale-like creature) appeared in Level 9 instead of Level 11.\n\nLolo and Lala are enjoying some time together when the Great King of Eggerland's son and heir throws a potion on all of Lolo and Lala's friends, turning them to stone. Lolo and Lala return home to see the damage that the Great king's son and heir has done and embark on a quest to stop him and return their friends to normal.\n\nThe player has the ability to select between playing as Lolo or Lala in the levels. Neither character has any advantage over the other, however, the only difference being in the tutorial levels.\n\nTwo changes to the gameplay included the crumbling bridge, which is a bridge that can only be crossed two times before it crumbles into nothingness. The other change was a new monster called Moby. Mobies only appear in the underwater levels and use a line of sight attack that sucks Lolo in towards them. Though not directly a fatal attack, it can cause Lolo to get stuck and have to restart the room.\n\nWhen pressing select to give up, Lolo does not actually die this time. Instead, a short \"give up\" tune plays and the level restarts. Pressing Start will return the player to the overworld map. Pressing start again reveals the password to that point in the game. Adventures of Lolo 3 uses 16-character passwords instead of four-character ones.\n\nThe game features a total of 17 levels with 100 different puzzle rooms, nine boss rooms, and ten training rooms. Levels 3, 13, and 17 have ten rooms each. The other levels only have five rooms. Levels 4-7, 9-12, and 17 have a boss at the end. The two big trees on the overworld map are where the training rooms are, each tree having five rooms each.\n\nReception to Adventures of Lolo 3 is universally positive. Dylan Cornelius of Questicle wrote that Adventures of Lolo 3 is \"worth every penny.\" Lee Evans of Downwards Compatible wrote, \"If you like puzzlers, the Lolo series is a ton of fun, and Adventures of Lolo 3 is a standout.\"\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the game an A, and later picked the game as the #10 greatest game available in 1991.\n\n"}

{"id": "1030925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1030925", "title": "Backing vocalist", "text": "Backing vocalist\n\nBacking vocalists (British English) or backup singers (American English) are singers who provide vocal harmony with the lead vocalist or other backing vocalists. In some cases, a backing vocalist may sing alone as a lead-in to the main vocalist's entry or to sing a counter-melody. Backing vocalists are used in a broad range of popular music, traditional music and world music styles.\n\nSolo artists may employ professional backing vocalists in studio recording sessions as well as during concerts. In many rock and metal bands (e.g., the power trio), the musicians doing backing vocals also play instruments, such as guitar, electric bass, drums, or keyboards. In Latin or Afro-Cuban groups, backing singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and hip-hop groups and in musical theater, the backing singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.\n\nThe style of singing used by backing singers varies according to the type of song and the genre of music the band plays. In pop and country songs, backing vocalists may perform vocal harmony parts to support the lead vocalist. In hardcore punk or rockabilly, other band members who play instruments may sing or shout backing vocals during the chorus (refrain) section of the songs.\n\nAlternative terms for backing vocalists include \"backing singers\", \"backing vocals\", \"additional vocals\" or, particularly in the United States and Canada, \"backup singers\" or sometimes \"background singers\" or \"harmony vocalists\".\n\nWhile some bands use performers whose sole on-stage role is performing backing vocals, it is common for backing singers to have other roles. Two notable examples of band members who sang back-up are The Beach Boys and The Beatles. The Beach Boys were well known for their close vocal harmonies, occasionally with all five members singing at once such as \"In My Room\" and \"Surfer Girl\". All five members would sing lead, although most often Brian Wilson or Mike Love would sing lead with guitarists Carl Wilson and Al Jardine and drummer Dennis Wilson singing background harmonies. \n\nThe Beatles were also known for their close style of vocal harmonies – all Beatles members sang both lead and backing vocals at some point, especially John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who frequently supported each other with harmonies, often with fellow Beatle George Harrison joining in. Ringo Starr, while not as prominent in the role of backing singer as his three bandmates due to his distinctive voice, can be heard singing backing vocals in such tracks as \"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\" and \"Carry That Weight\". Examples of three-part harmonies by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison include \"Nowhere Man\", \"Because\", \"Day Tripper\", and \"This Boy\".\nThe members of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and Bee Gees all each wrote songs and sang back-up or lead vocals and played various instruments on their albums and various collaborations with each other.\n\nFormer guitarist John Frusciante and current guitarist Josh Klinghoffer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers sing nearly all backing vocals (few songs were recorded without backing vocals), often singing some parts without accompaniment from lead vocalist Anthony Kiedis. The band's bassist Flea occasionally filled in for additional vocals. Frusciante usually sang one song by himself during concerts. Another example is \"No Frontiers\" by The Corrs, which is sung by Sharon and Caroline.\n\nOther backing vocalists include Sebastien Lefebvre (rhythm guitarist at the same time) and David Desrosiers (Bass guitarist, also at the same time ) for pop punk band Simple Plan, John Petrucci of Dream Theater, and guitarists Zacky Vengeance and Synyster Gates of heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold.\n\nIn the recording studio, some lead singers record their own backing vocals by overdubbing with a multitrack recording system. A multitrack recording system enables the record producer to add many layers of recordings over top of each other. Using a multitrack system, a lead vocalist can record his or her own backing vocals, and then record the lead vocal part over top. Some lead vocalists prefer this approach because the sound of their own harmonies will blend well with their main vocal. \n\nOne famous example is Freddie Mercury of Queen singing the first part of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" himself by overdubbing. Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy, Wednesday 13, in his own band, and as the lead and backing vocalist of Murderdolls, Ian Gillan of Deep Purple, Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran and Brad Delp of Boston also recorded lead and backing vocals for their albums.\n\nWith the exception of a few songs on each album, Dan Fogelberg, Eddie Rabbitt, David Bowie and Richard Marx sing all of the background vocals for their songs. Robert Smith of the Cure not only sings his own backing vocals in the studio, but also doesn't perform with backing vocalists when playing live.\n\nMany metalcore and some post-hardcore bands, such as As I Lay Dying, Alexisonfire, Haste the Day and Silverstein feature a main vocalist who performs using harsh vocals, whilst the backing vocalist sings harmonies (clean vocals) during choruses to create a contrast. Some bands, such as Hawthorne Heights and Finch have the backing singers do harsh vocals to highlight specific lyrics.\n\nPop and R&B vocalists such as Diana Ross, Ariana Grande, Mariah Carey, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Prince, Beyoncé Knowles, Brandy, Faith Evans, D'Angelo, Mary J. Blige and Amerie have become known specifically for not only recording their own backing vocals, but for arranging their own multi-tracked vocals and even developing highly complex harmonies and arrangements. When they perform live, they may have backing vocalists who impersonate their voices.\n\nSome bands use backing vocals in order to contrast with the lead singer who may be performing an unusual vocal technique. For example, Brian \"Head\" Welch, the lead guitarist of the band Korn, performed backing vocals on several songs, and notably on the song \"Ball Tongue\", he screams the chorus while lead vocalist Jonathan Davis sings incomprehensible scat vocals. Similarly, the Canadian deathcore group Despised Icon uses two vocalists, one performing screams and another performing low, growling death grunts who alternate, and sometimes sing in unison to highlight certain lyrics. In rap music, a background rapper who chants and rhymes to support the main artist is often referred to as hype man.\n\nWorking as a backing singer can give a vocalist the onstage experience and vocal training they need to develop into a lead vocalist. A number of lead vocalists such as Ace Frehley, Richard Marx, Mariah Carey, Cher, Gwen Stefani, Pink, Whitney Houston, Phil Collins, Sheryl Crow, Trisha Yearwood, Dave Grohl, Jerry Only, Jerry Cantrell, Jason Newsted, Dee Dee Ramone and Elton John, learned their craft as backing singers, or singing backing vocals as part of a choir.\n\nNotable uncredited background vocals appear in the following songs:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43796273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43796273", "title": "Card money", "text": "Card money\n\nCard money is a type of fiat money printed on plain cardboard or playing cards, which was used at times as currency in several colonies and countries (including Dutch Guiana, New France, and France) from the 17th century to the early 19th century. Where introduced, it was often followed by high rates of inflation.\n\nIn order to prepare playing cards or plain cardboard for use as currency, the medium had to be given a denomination, a seal, a serial number, and appropriate signatures. In New France, this meant an embossed fleur-de-lis and the signatures of the intendant, governor, and treasurer. In Dutch Guiana, meanwhile, the form these validations took varied between issue.\n\nCard money was generally issued, at least initially, in emergency situations. It could be backed by other currencies, such as Bills of Exchange, or be without guarantee.\n\nDuring the expansion of the French colony in New France (in what is now Canada) in the 17th century, currency used had to be imported from France. When the colony faced insolvency owing to great expenses fighting the Iroquois and a diminishing beaver trade, intendant Jacques de Meulles introduced card money to pay soldiers; this soon spread into general use, including commerce. The introduction of card money allowed the colony to reduce deliveries of specie, which could be lost at sea to weather or attack; no specie could be produced locally owing to a lack of precious metals. The currency caught on, and values equal to 100 \"livres\" are recorded. Eventually, an estimated two million \"livres\" in card money is thought to have circulated.\n\nBy the end of the decade New France faced counterfeiting problems with this currency, although counterfeiters could be caned, branded, banished, flogged, or even hanged. It was ultimately inflation, however, which led to the decline of card money in French Canada: the money was produced in a greater quantity than required, in part to offset a failing French economy, while coins were hoarded. Attempts to decrease the value of the cards by half failed, and in 1717 the card money was withdrawn. By 1720 it had been declared worthless.\n\nThe recall of card money led to more than a decade of stagnancy, as there was no circulating currency. For this reason, in 1730 the government reinstated card money, reaching a total value of 600,000 \"livres\" by 1733. Unlike the earlier issues of card money, however, these were printed on plain cards, rather than playing cards. In 1763, after another burst of inflation brought on by a turbulent war-time economy, card money was ultimately and permanently withdrawn from the settlement.\n\nBetween 1716 and 1720, John Law and his privately held (French government backed) Banque Royale issued paper currency in colonial French Louisiana far in excess of the reserve set aside to back these issues. When investors attempted to redeem notes for specie, the bank stopped payment. The \"Mississippi Bubble\" began to burst in May 1720, when Banque Royale notes were depreciated by 50% followed by a financial crisis in France. For nearly 18 months there was no official circulating currency. The Company of the Indies ran storehouses for employees. The purchase of goods required vouchers which circulated as a makeshift currency. The company began issuing card money in January 1722 with two authorizing signatures of company directors in France or local officers in Louisiana. Denominations ranged from 5 sous to 50 livres, in different shapes to be easily distinguished by non-French speaking and illiterate population. With the introduction of the company card money also came severe inflation. By 1725 both the company vouchers and cards had been redeemed.\n\nIn the early 1730s, again faced with a shortage of specie and letters of exchange, the Count of Maurepas recommended applying a card money system, similar to the one then in use in Canada, in French Louisiana. This was intended for domestic trade, without any mark-up, and to be backed through letters of exchange. On 14 September 1735, the French Crown approved an issue of card money up to 200,000 livres, with a quota of 150,000 livres for letters of exchange. Cards were prepared and signed by the Crown's comptroller in Louisiana, with higher denominations requiring the countersignatures of the governor and \"ordonnateur\". For the next two years the value of the card money remained stable, sustained by \"ordonnateur\" Edmé Gatien Salmon's issuance of letters of exchange in excess of the quota. By 1739, however, value of the card money had decreased, as attempts to redeem the cards for letters of exchange went unfilled. The colony was incurring great expenses during their war with the Chickasaw, and – with the French government unwilling to increase the quota for letters of exchange – by 1741 Salmon was already drawing on his quota for 1744. This shortage, and resulting inflation, meant that by 1743 the card money was essentially worthless. In 1745, with war still ongoing, the card money and other paper issued by the colony was burned; before liquidization, notes were exchanged for letters of exchange at two fifths of face value.\n\nA 1758 request by \"ordonnateur\" Vincent de Rochemore, that card money again be issued, went ignored. Some of the Louisiana card money remained extant into the 1760s. However, none of the several thousand government notes issued are known to have survived until the present. There are likewise no known surviving examples of Company of the Indies issues.\n\nBy the 1740s the administrators of Fort de Chartres, in the Illinois Country, were using card money to pay their troops; the numismatist Harry Wigington suggests that the currency was introduced by administrators who had experience with similar notes in Canada or New Orleans. Known as \"Solde de Troupe\" notes, this card money did not have official government backing. Rather, it was authorized by the fort's commanders and applied by the guardians of its warehouse. These notes were discontinued when the British – who, by law, had to pay their soldiers in specie – assumed control of the fort in 1763. However, owing to continued French cultural and social influence, circulation and issuance of these notes continued into the mid-1760s.\n\nCard money was first used in Dutch Guiana, now Suriname, in 1761. Issues could be on plain cards or playing cards, and were at first cut into circles approximately in diameter, resembling coins. Later card money was rectangular, in order to save on labor, although some issues continued to be round or even hexagonal. Initial issues were in the value of 1, 2.5, and 10 guilders, later followed by issues of 0.5, 5, and 100 guilders. The cards, which had no intrinsic value, were initially backed by bills of exchange from the Netherlands but later released unsecured.\n\nThe card currency produced in Guiana soon outpaced demand, such that inflation became an issue, and although the cards ostensibly traded at 3 card guilders to 2.50 guilders from the Netherlands, the value began fluctuating greatly. However, the colony's residents continued to use card money, and when Guiana was controlled by the British in the early 19th century, they also produced this money, fearing a deficit. The Dutch regained control of Guiana in 1816, and the card money continued. In 1826, the Dutch colonial government formally introduced paper currency, similar to Dutch banknotes but with the word \"Suriname\" overprinted on the bills. The colony's card money was not formally abolished until two years later.\n\nIn his 1997 book \"Surinam Paper Currency\", Theo van Elmpt records a total of 94 issues of card money in the country, and the Central Bank of Suriname estimates that the total face value of the cards issued was between five and ten million guilders. However, few specimens survive. In the oral tradition of the Suriname Maroons, the term \"Wan Bigi Karta\" (\"a big card\") continued to refer to the sum of 3.20 guilders as late as 1900.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, \"billets de confiance\" (\"bills of trust\") were issued on card money and similar paper by employers or similar authorities. An estimated 5500 different \"billets\" were issued from approximately 1500 communes between 1790 and 1793. They were generally printed on cards or coloured paper, and signed by the bearer or issuing authority. This money was generally oriented horizontally, and decorations could include revolutionary symbolism (such as a liberty cap or fasces), patriotic slogans, the name of commune where a \"billet\" was issued, or an ornate border.\n\nThese \"billets de confiance\" bore no guarantee, but could be exchanged for \"assignats\", a type of paper currency introduced by the revolutionary government of which there was a shortage. However, issuing authorities were not required to keep enough \"assignats\" on hand to redeem all the card money they issued; the Paris-based Maison de Secours ran up a deficit of 2 million livres by issuing more \"billets de confiance\" than they held in \"assignats\". The \"billets\" faced heavy counterfeiting, which resulted in the issuing authorities making more complex designs. In February 1792 tax collectors stopped accepting payments in \"billets de confiance\"; economist suggests that this may have been due to concerns over counterfeiting. Ultimately, in mid-1793 the issuing of card money was stopped.\n\nVeronique Deblon, writing for the National Bank of Belgium, notes that all issues of card money \"could not be called unqualified success[es]\", as they were capable of solving budget deficits but eventually were overproduced, leading to inflation. The numismatist Neil Shafer concurs, noting that the card money of Guiana \"served its purpose\" in spite of the devaluation. In his article on the card money in French Canada, Larry Allen described it as \"show[ing] the flexibility, adaptability, and inventiveness of an expanding economic system\", despite \"seem[ing] ... far-fetched\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2156067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2156067", "title": "Disaster tourism", "text": "Disaster tourism\n\nDisaster tourism has been defined as the practice of visiting locations at which an environmental disaster, either natural or man-made, has occurred. Although a variety of disasters are the subject of subsequent disaster tourism, the most common disaster tourist sites are the areas surrounding volcanic eruptions. Opinions on the morality and impact of disaster tourism are divided. Advocates of disaster tourism often claim that the practice raises awareness of the event, stimulates the local economy, and educates the public about the local culture, while critics claim that the practice is exploitative, profits on loss, and often mischaracterizes the events in question.\n\nThere are many reasons that people come to visit disaster sites. Some tourists may have personal connections to the tragedy as survivors, relatives of victims, or witnesses while other visitors have an intellectual or cultural interest, wanting to understand what happened or connect the tragedy to other cultural events. This latter group typically comprises educators, historians, academics and students. Another population of visitors hope to aid in providing relief to the affected areas—some directly through volunteer work and some indirectly through donations. Other visitors have no connection to the site or the event, but happen to be there as tourists and visit those places as part of their sightseeing. A common example of this is tourists who come to Italy to sightsee in Rome and end up visiting Pompeii and its neighboring cities without initially intending to do so.\n\nDisaster tourism had a mixed reception, with critics labelling it as voyeuristic and profiting off of loss and with advocates arguing that the tourism stimulates the recovering economy and brings awareness to local culture. Although the public perception of tourism depends on a wide variety of factors, such whether the disaster was man-made or natural and how long it has been since incident, there are some general trends in the reception of tourism.\n\nDepending on the site or tour, disaster tourism can be seen to be an educational experience or exploitative. Whether or not a tourist site is handled in a respectful and tactful manner often is determined both by those organizing the events and the tourists themselves. Moreover, advocates of disaster tourism point out that attractions are capable of re-examining disasters in an educational manner despite that the operators are motivated by profit. Many of these advocates argue that when distasteful disaster tourism occurs, the blame lies primarily on the tourists for providing an insensitive demand rather on the operators for fulfilling such a demand. For both tourists and operators, however, parsing the difference between an educational and an exploitative one requires asking what areas are crucial for understanding the disaster and clarifying how behavior that is appropriate in a destroyed area is often different from behavior that is appropriate in newly built homes or temporary camps.\n\nThe effect of tourism on the local economy is often nuanced due to the specifics in how tourism affects local income. It is generally accepted that if the tours comprise public events organized by volunteers, then there are consistent but small increases to charity donations. However, if the tours are organized by private companies, then it is not always clear how what proportion of the profits go back into relief efforts. Furthermore, while governmental regulation typically prevents private tours from slowing down or reversing reconstruction in areas where reconstruction has already began, critics argue that private touring may deincentivize the reconstruction of locations and sites, in which reconstruction has yet to occur. Another possible situation is that the tours are not organized by formal entities but instead by less cohesive groups of citizens. These cases are relatively unstudied due to their rarity.\n\nSimilarly, visiting disaster sites is thought to have an effect on empathy, but the nature of the effect it has depends on the particulars of the visit. Unorganized visits, for example, can often raise empathy by forcing the visitors to see suffering up close and prompting them to consider how to interact with victims. More organized visits, on the other hand, have been accused of lowering empathy because they compromised tourists “acting like tourists and dressing like tourists,” which dilutes and sanitizes the experience.\n\nIn September 2017, Hurricane Maria devastated the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Hurricane Maria is estimated to caused 4,645 deaths total, and in Puerto Rico, it is estimated to have caused $94 billion in property damage and displaced approximately 60,000 people.\n\nOn October 9, 2017, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook social VR chief Rachel Franklin used a livestream to showcase Facebook’s new VR app, Facebook Spaces, by taking a virtual tour of the devastated areas Puerto Rico. During the 10 minute video, Zuckerberg explains how Facebook partnered with Red Cross to build population map from satellite imagery and better allocate the relief effort.\n\nThe public reception to the tour was unanimously negative. Zuckerberg drew criticism for describing VR as \"magical\" in its ability to transport people to disaster zones, and most viewers considered the cartoon avatars of Zuckerberg and Franklin to be an inappropriately jovial tone. The day following the livestream, Zuckerberg apologized, explaining, \"When you're in VR yourself, the surroundings feel quite real. But that sense of empathy doesn't extend well to people watching you as a virtual character on a 2D screen.\"\n\nWhen the nearby volcano Mt Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, the eruption buried the city of Pompeii and the nearby city of Herculaneum and preserved everything from its streets to its frescoes under mounds of pumice and ash. Although Pompeii was initially rediscovered in 1599, tourism was undesirable until Spanish engineer Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre performed a much larger evacuation in 1748, which revealed many noteworthy structures, such as a fully intact Roman theatre.\n\nToday, Pompeii belongs to the much larger Vesuvius National Park and is one of Italy’s most popular tourist sites, attracting approximately 2.5 million visitors annually.\n\nIn the early evening of May 6, 1937, the German passenger airship LZ 129 Hindenburg burst into flame during a docking attempt at the Lakehurst Naval Air Station, just outside Lakehurst, New Jersey. With the cause of the fire unknown and a death toll of thirty-seven passengers, the Hindenburg disaster became one of the biggest news stories of its time.\n\nToday, a bronze plaque and cement outline the site of the incident. Immediately east of the crash site, volunteers of the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society will conduct public tours of Historic Hangar One, the location where the Hindenburg was kept.\n\nOn the morning of April 26, 1986, the number four reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded, producing airborne radioactive materials and a fire that burned for ten days. The Chernobyl explosion caused dozens of direct deaths and thousands of deaths due to long-term exposure. In the aftermath, 350,000 residents were displaced from Chernobyl and the nearby city of Pripyat. The other three reactors at Chernobyl power plant continued running at the time but were gradually lessened until the power plant’s shutdown in 2000.\n\nThe Ukraine-based tour company SoloEast Travel currently runs daylong tours through Chernobyl’s exclusion zone, a thousand square-mile area that includes the plant. The highlights of the tour include visiting Red Forest, a pine tree woodland destroyed by radioactive contamination, exploring Kopachi, a nearby village that was demolished due to high contamination levels, and finally coming within 1000 feet of the remains of the number four reactor. These tours are met with some controversy because despite that SoloEast Travel claims that publicly accessible areas surrounding the power plant contain low levels of radiation and are deemed safe, a number of third party scientists disagree.\n\nIn 1989, the \"Exxon Valdez\" oil tanker struck Alaska's Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound and leaked crude oil into the sound. The amount of oil spilled is currently estimated to be over 30 million gallons. Oil from the spill would eventually contaminate more than 11,000 square-miles of ocean and 1300 miles of coastline. The spill killed hundreds of sea otters, harbor seals, and eagles and hundreds of thousands of seabird in the days following the spill. Despite that it is not the world's largest oil spill, the \"Exxon Valdez\" oil spill is typically considered the most notorious in American history.\n\nHaving been among the first responders, the family-run Stan Stephens Cruises operates glacier tours out of Prince William Sound that highlight the history surrounding the Exxon Valdez spill and its aftermath.\n\nIn late August 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated the American city of New Orleans. Although 80–90% of the population was evacuated prior, twenty-three breaches in navigational canal levees, drainage canal levees, and floodwalls occurred as a result of Katrina’s storm surge. With these failures, 80% of New Orleans became flooded, which in turn caused over 200,000 homes to be destroyed and 800,000 residents to be displaced. At the time, the disaster had a large impact on the politics, population, and economics for a sizable portion of the United States.\n\nA decade after the incident, the effects of Hurricane Katrina are still visible and catastrophic. Although many companies offer bus tours of the still-damaged regions, critics argues that these tours interfere with the relief effort. Some have suggested that curious tourists should instead go on bike tours in order to restrict the disruption to residents trying to get their lives back on track. Quite frequently, tours will focus on showcasing the culture of specific districts and neighborhood, treating Hurricane Katrina as the most recent event in a much longer cultural history. Many tours donate their profits or a portion of their profits to local relief organizations.\n\nEyjafjallajökull, in Iceland, began erupting on 20 March 2010. At this time, about 500 farmers and their families from the areas of Fljótshlíð, Eyjafjöll, and Landeyjar were evacuated overnight, but allowed to return to their farms and homes after Civil Protection Department risk assessment. On 14 April 2010, Eyjafjallajökull erupted for the second time, requiring 800 people to be evacuated.\n\nIn the wake of the first eruption, tour companies offered trips to see the volcano. However, the ash cloud from the second eruption disrupted air traffic over Great Britain and most of northern and western Europe, making it difficult to travel to Iceland even though Iceland's airspace itself remained open throughout.\n\nIn the November of 2010, the active Indonesian volcano of Mt Merapi had its eruption in a century, which led to direct deaths of 353 people and the displacement of approximately 400,000 people in nearby villages.\n\nMt Merapi is unique among disaster tourist sites because Merapi was a popular tourist site prior to the volcano’s eruption, and tourism had already made up a significant portion of the local economy. While many tour companies and travel agencies hold more standard sightseeing tours of the affected areas, some programs provide more direct paths to donating to local charities and getting involved in the relief effort. For example, the Go Green Campaign encourages tourists to purchase small trees or seeds and plant them in local villages.\n\n"}

It is a method by which the identity of the top card may be kept secret by lifting the top two cards as one, making it seem as if only the top card is picked up. Similar techniques may be applied to more than two cards to perform a triple or even quadruple lift. The term was coined by Theo Annemann.\n\nWhen the card is shown to the audience, the audience is tricked into believing that they are shown the top card in the deck where in fact they are shown the second card. When the cards are displayed, the maneuver is sometimes called the \"double turnover\".\n\nSome versions of the ambitious card routine rely almost entirely upon this sleight. In combination with a few other mechanics and good showmanship, entire acts can and have been made out of this single move.\n\nThe first recorded publishing of the double lift is in Richard Neve's book \"The Merry Companion\" in 1776. It can be seen on page 141, item XXV under \"to seem to change the top card of the pack into another\". The double lift was next seen in print in the 19th century in Jean Nicholas Ponsin's \"Nouvelle Magie Blanche Dévoilée\". The earliest reference to the double lift in the 20th century is in John Northern Hilliard's book \"Greater Magic\".\n\nMany confuse the creation of the double lift with the Dai Vernon double turnover, which is an extension of the double lift where two cards are flipped to hide the identity of the top card. Still, many magicians and magic historians debate that Vernon was the creator, though he never has claimed to be the creator. In an interview in the 1982 small-time film \"The Wonder of Magic\", Dai Vernon said that he \"may be the creator\" of the double turnover, but wasn't certain.\n"}

It covered technical advances in the industry such as the launch of satellite television and NICAM stereo, along with details of new transmitters and the scheduling of transmitter downtime.\n\n\"Engineering Announcements\", and the BBC's similar \"Service Information\", are examples of regularly scheduled \"ghost programmes,\" so called because they were never advertised in on-air schedules, in newspaper TV listings, the \"TV Times\" or on teletext.\n\n\"Engineering Announcements\" was originally scheduled directly after \"Monday's Newcomers\", another example of a ghost programme which offered the advertising trade the opportunity to watch first runs of new adverts before they aired in prime time on ITV. It was shown at 9:45am.\n\nIn September 1972, \"Engineering Announcements\" moved to 9:10am on Tuesdays, where it remained until May 1983. The launch of TV-am meant that the ITV network would no longer be available to show \"Engineering Announcements\" at the old time although they were still shown on ITV at 9:17am, in the 10-minute gap between the end of TV-am and the start of ITV - the gap was needed to allow for switching ITV from national transmission to the local ITV contractor. This became automated shortly after TV-am's launch and the gap was no longer required. TV-am's hours were extended until 9:25am and consequently the slot used to transmit \"Engineering Announcements\" disappeared.\n\nGiven that Channel 4 and S4C, still in its infancy, generally didn't start broadcasting until the early evening, the programme was transferred to Channel 4 (except for Wales where it handed over to S4C) and screened at 9:15am each Tuesday, with a repeat at 12:15pm the same day. However, as Channel 4 and S4C gradually lengthened its broadcasting hours throughout the 1980s, \"Engineering Announcements\" was forced into increasingly earlier time slots, losing first the 12:15pm repeat when it took over ITV's programmes for schools and colleges in September 1987. It moved to 8:10am at the start of 1989 and when Channel 4 launched its own breakfast television service in April 1989, \"Engineering Announcements\" was moved to 5:45am, where it could be recorded by engineers for later viewing.\n\n\"Engineering Announcements\" broadcast for the final time on 31 July 1990. This was a retrospective programme.\n\nDuring the ITV strike from August to October 1979, \"Engineering Announcements\" was the only programme broadcast on most of the network.\n\n"}

{"id": "736803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=736803", "title": "Expected utility hypothesis", "text": "Expected utility hypothesis\n\nIn economics, game theory, and decision theory the expected utility hypothesis, concerning people's preferences with regard to choices that have uncertain outcomes (gambles), states that the subjective value associated with an individual's gamble is the statistical expectation of that individual's valuations of the outcomes of that gamble, where these valuations may differ from the dollar value of those outcomes.\n\nInitiated by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, this hypothesis has proven useful to explain some popular choices that seem to contradict the expected value criterion (which takes into account only the sizes of the payouts and the probabilities of occurrence), such as occur in the contexts of gambling and insurance. Until the mid-twentieth century, the standard term for the expected utility was the moral expectation, contrasted with \"mathematical expectation\" for the expected value.\n\nThe von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions under which the expected utility hypothesis holds. From relatively early on, it was accepted that some of these conditions would be violated by real decision-makers in practice but that the conditions could be interpreted nonetheless as 'axioms' of rational choice.\n\nWhen the entity formula_1 whose value formula_2 affects a person’s utility takes on one of a set of discrete values, the formula for expected utility, which is assumed to be maximized, is\n\nwhere the left side is the subjective valuation of the gamble as a whole, formula_4 is the \"i\"th possible outcome, formula_5 is its valuation, and formula_6 is its probability. There could be either a finite set of possible values formula_7 in which case the right side of this equation has a finite number of terms; or there could be an infinite set of discrete values, in which case the right side has an infinite number of terms.\n\nWhen formula_1 can take on any of a continuous range of values, the expected utility is given by\n\nwhere formula_10 is the probability density function of formula_11\n\nIn the presence of risky outcomes, a human decision maker does not always choose the option with higher expected value investments. For example, suppose there is a choice between a guaranteed payment of $1, and a gamble in which the probability of getting a $100 payment is 1 in 80 and the alternative, far more likely outcome is getting nothing (the expected value is then $1.25); according to expected value theory people should choose the $100-or-nothing gamble, but as stressed by expected utility theory, some people are risk averse enough to prefer the sure thing, even though it has a lower expected value, while other less risk averse people would still choose the riskier, higher-mean gamble.\n\nNicolas Bernoulli described the St. Petersburg paradox (involving infinite expected values) in 1713, prompting two Swiss mathematicians to develop expected utility theory as a solution. The theory can also more accurately describe more realistic scenarios (where expected values are finite) than expected value alone. In 1728, Gabriel Cramer, in a letter to Nicolas Bernoulli, wrote, \"the mathematicians estimate money in proportion to its quantity, and men of good sense in proportion to the usage that they may make of it.\"\n\nIn 1738, Nicolas' cousin Daniel Bernoulli, published the canonical 18th Century description of this solution in \"Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis\" or \"Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk\". Daniel Bernoulli proposed that a nonlinear function of utility of an outcome should be used instead of the expected value of an outcome, accounting for risk aversion, where the risk premium is higher for low-probability events than the difference between the payout level of a particular outcome and its expected value. \n\nBernoulli's paper was the first formalization of marginal utility, which has broad application in economics in addition to expected utility theory. He used this concept to formalize the idea that the same amount of additional money was less useful to an already-wealthy person than it would be to a poor person.\n\nThe St. Petersburg paradox (named after the journal in which Bernoulli's paper was published) arises when there is no upper bound on the potential rewards from very low probability events. Because some probability distribution functions have an infinite expected value, an expected-wealth maximizing person would pay an arbitrarily large finite amount to take this gamble. In real life, people do not do this.\n\nBernoulli proposed a solution to this paradox in his paper: the utility function used in real life means that the expected utility of the gamble is finite, even if its expected value is infinite. (Thus he hypothesized diminishing marginal utility of increasingly larger amounts of money.) It has also been resolved differently by other economists by proposing that very low probability events are neglected, by taking into account the finite resources of the participants, or by noting that one simply cannot buy that which is not sold (and that sellers would not produce a lottery whose expected loss to them were unacceptable).\n\nThere are four axioms of the expected utility theory that define a \"rational\" decision maker. They are completeness, transitivity, independence and continuity.\n\nCompleteness assumes that an individual has well defined preferences and can always decide between any two alternatives.\nThis means that the individual either prefers A to B, or is indifferent between A and B, or prefers B to A.\n\nTransitivity assumes that, as an individual decides according to the completeness axiom, the individual also decides consistently.\n\nIndependence of irrelevant alternatives pertains to well-defined preferences as well. It assumes that two gambles mixed with an irrelevant third one will maintain the same order of preference as when the two are presented independently of the third one. The independence axiom is the most controversial axiom..\n\nContinuity assumes that when there are three lotteries (A, B and C) and the individual prefers A to B and B to C, then there should be a possible combination of A and C in which the individual is then indifferent between this mix and the lottery B.\n\nIf all these axioms are satisfied, then the individual is said to be rational and the preferences can be represented by a utility function, i.e. one can assign numbers (utilities) to each outcome of the lottery such that choosing the best lottery according to the preference formula_23 amounts to choosing the lottery with the highest expected utility. This result is called the von Neumann–Morgenstern utility representation theorem.\n\nIn other words, if an individual's behavior always satisfies the above axioms, then there is a utility function such that the individual will choose one gamble over another if and only if the expected utility of one exceeds that of the other. The expected utility of any gamble may be expressed as a linear combination of the utilities of the outcomes, with the weights being the respective probabilities. Utility functions are also normally continuous functions. Such utility functions are also referred to as von Neumann–Morgenstern (vNM) utility functions. This is a central theme of the expected utility hypothesis in which an individual chooses not the highest expected value, but rather the highest expected utility. The expected utility maximizing individual makes decisions rationally based on the axioms of the theory.\n\nThe von Neumann–Morgenstern formulation is important in the application of set theory to economics because it was developed shortly after the Hicks–Allen \"ordinal revolution\" of the 1930s, and it revived the idea of cardinal utility in economic theory. However, while in this context the \"utility function\" is cardinal, in that implied behavior would be altered by a non-linear monotonic transformation of utility, the \"expected utility function\" is ordinal because any monotonic increasing transformation of expected utility gives the same behavior.\n\nThe expected utility theory takes into account that individuals may be risk-averse, meaning that the individual would refuse a fair gamble (a fair gamble has an expected value of zero). Risk aversion implies that their utility functions are concave and show diminishing marginal wealth utility. The risk attitude is directly related to the curvature of the utility function: risk neutral individuals have linear utility functions, while risk seeking individuals have convex utility functions and risk averse individuals have concave utility functions. The degree of risk aversion can be measured by the curvature of the utility function.\n\nSince the risk attitudes are unchanged under affine transformations of \"u\", the second derivative \"u\"\" is not an adequate measure of the risk aversion of a utility function. Instead, it needs to be normalized. This leads to the definition of the Arrow–Pratt measure of absolute risk aversion:\n\nwhere formula_25 is wealth.\n\nThe Arrow–Pratt measure of relative risk aversion is:\n\nSpecial classes of utility functions are the CRRA (constant relative risk aversion) functions, where RRA(w) is constant, and the CARA (constant absolute risk aversion) functions, where ARA(w) is constant. They are often used in economics for simplification.\n\nA decision that maximizes expected utility also maximizes the probability of the decision's consequences being preferable to some uncertain threshold (Castagnoli and LiCalzi,1996; Bordley and LiCalzi,2000; Bordley and Kirkwood). In the absence of uncertainty about the threshold, expected utility maximization simplifies to maximizing the probability of achieving some fixed target. If the uncertainty is uniformly distributed, then expected utility maximization becomes expected value maximization. Intermediate cases lead to increasing risk aversion above some fixed threshold and increasing risk seeking below a fixed threshold.\n\nThe utility function formula_27 was originally suggested by Bernoulli (see above). It has relative risk aversion constant and equal to one, and is still sometimes assumed in economic analyses. The utility function \n\nexhibits constant absolute risk aversion, and for this reason is often avoided, although it has the advantage of offering substantial mathematical tractability when asset returns are normally distributed. Note that, as per the affine transformation property alluded to above, the utility function formula_29 gives exactly the same preferences orderings as does formula_30; thus it is irrelevant that the values of formula_30 and its expected value are always negative: what matters for preference ordering is which of two gambles gives the higher expected utility, not the numerical values of those expected utilities.\n\nThe class of constant relative risk aversion utility functions contains three categories. Bernoulli's utility function\n\nhas relative risk aversion equal to 1. The functions\n\nfor formula_34 have relative risk aversion equal to formula_35. And the functions\n\nfor formula_37 have relative risk aversion equal to formula_38\n\nSee also the discussion of utility functions having hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA).\n\nOften people refer to \"risk\" in the sense of a potentially quantifiable entity. In the context of mean-variance analysis, variance is used as a risk measure for portfolio return; however, this is only valid if returns are normally distributed or otherwise jointly elliptically distributed, or in the unlikely case in which the utility function has a quadratic form. However, David E. Bell proposed a measure of risk which follows naturally from a certain class of von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions. Let utility of wealth be given by \n\nfor individual-specific positive parameters \"a\" and \"b\". Then expected utility is given by\nThus the risk measure is formula_41, which differs between two individuals if they have different values of the parameter formula_42 allowing different people to disagree about the degree of risk associated with any given portfolio. Individuals sharing a given risk measure (based on given value of \"a\") may choose different portfolios because they may have different values of \"b\". See also Entropic risk measure.\n\nFor general utility functions, however, expected utility analysis does not permit the expression of preferences to be separated into two parameters with one representing the expected value of the variable in question and the other representing its risk.\n\nExpected utility theory is a theory about how to make optimal decisions under risk. It has a normative interpretation which economists particularly used to think applies in all situations to rational agents but now tend to regard as a useful and insightful first order approximation. In empirical applications, a number of violations have been shown to be systematic and these falsifications have deepened understanding of how people actually decide. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979 presented their prospect theory which showed empirically, among other things, how preferences of individuals are inconsistent among the same choices, depending on how those choices are presented.\n\nLike any mathematical model, expected utility theory is an abstraction and simplification of reality. The mathematical correctness of expected utility theory and the salience of its primitive concepts do not guarantee that expected utility theory is a reliable guide to human behavior or optimal practice.\n\nThe mathematical clarity of expected utility theory has helped scientists design experiments to test its adequacy, and to distinguish systematic departures from its predictions. This has led to the field of behavioral finance, which has produced deviations from expected utility theory to account for the empirical facts.\n\nIt is well established that humans find logic hard, mathematics harder, and probability even more challenging. Psychologists have discovered systematic violations of probability calculations and behavior by humans. Consider, for example, the Monty Hall problem.\n\nIn updating probability distributions using evidence, a standard method uses conditional probability, namely the rule of Bayes. An experiment on belief revision has suggested that humans change their beliefs faster when using Bayesian methods than when using informal judgment.\n\nBehavioral finance has produced several generalized expected utility theories to account for\ninstances where people's choices deviate from those predicted by expected utility theory. These deviations are described as \"irrational\" because they can depend on the way the problem is presented, not on the actual costs, rewards, or probabilities involved.\n\nParticular theories include prospect theory, rank-dependent expected utility and cumulative prospect theory and SP/A theory.\n\nStarting with studies such as Lichtenstein & Slovic (1971), it was discovered that subjects sometimes exhibit signs of preference reversals with regard to their certainty equivalents of different lotteries. Specifically, when eliciting certainty equivalents, subjects tend to value \"p bets\" (lotteries with a high chance of winning a low prize) lower than \"$ bets\" (lotteries with a small chance of winning a large prize). When subjects are asked which lotteries they prefer in direct comparison, however, they frequently prefer the \"p bets\" over \"$ bets\". Many studies have examined this \"preference reversal\", from both an experimental (e.g., Plott & Grether, 1979) and theoretical (e.g., Holt, 1986) standpoint, indicating that this behavior can be brought into accordance with neoclassical economic theory under specific assumptions.\n\nIf one is using the frequentist notion of probability, where probabilities are considered to be fixed values, then applying expected value and expected utility to decision-making requires knowing the probabilities of various outcomes. However, in practice there will be many situations where the probabilities are unknown, and one is operating under uncertainty. In economics, Knightian uncertainty or ambiguity may occur. Thus one must make assumptions about the probabilities, but then the expected values of various decisions can be very sensitive to the assumptions. This is particularly a problem when the expectation is dominated by rare extreme events, as in a long-tailed distribution.\n\nAlternative decision techniques are robust to uncertainty of probability of outcomes, either not depending on probabilities of outcomes and only requiring scenario analysis (as in minimax or minimax regret), or being less sensitive to assumptions.\n\nBayesian approaches to probability treat it as a degree of belief and thus they do not draw a distinction between risk and a wider concept of uncertainty: they deny the existence of Knightian uncertainty. They would model uncertain probabilities with hierarchical models, i.e. where the uncertain probabilities are modelled as distributions whose parameters are themselves drawn from a higher-level distribution (hyperpriors).\n\n"}

Mingaud; born 4 January 1771 Le Cailar, Nîmes, France, died 23 December 1847, Rotterdam, Netherlands) was an infantry officer in the French army and a carom billiards player. He is credited as the inventor of the leather for a billiards cue, a \"possibly not original idea\" that he perfected while imprisoned in Bicêtre (now Bicêtre Hospital) for political outspokenness. This revolutionized the game of billiards, allowing the cue ball to be finely manipulated by the application of .\n\nIn 1807 he was released from prison and began to demonstrate his invention and spin technique in Paris. Part of his showmanship involved feigning extreme horror as the cue ball recoiled towards him after striking the object ball, and then persuading the audience that the balls should be seized and condemned because they were \"tormented by a devil\". Mingaud is also credited with the discovery that by raising the cue vertically he could perform what is now known as a shot.\n\nMingaud was born in 1771 in Le Cailar near Nîmes in the Département of the Gard in France. He joined the army under Napoleon and served as a captain.\n\nAfter his release from prison in Paris during 1807 he toured France and Europe demonstrating his 'trick shot' prowess.\n\nIn 1822 Mingaud settled on the Hoogstraat in Rotterdam and by 1825, when he was 54, he had remarried.\n\nFrench archives show Mingaud was arrested in the Netherlands for \"involvement in the conspiracy of Cadoudal,\" (referring to Georges Cadoudal) and labeled an \"adventurer whose presence in society can only be dangerous.\" He was imprisoned in Bicêtre, a men's prison in Paris which is now the site of Bicêtre Hospital. (Many internet sources incorrectly report the Bastille as the site of Mingaud's imprisonment, but this is impossible. The Bastille was destroyed in the French Revolution prior to Mingaud's incarceration.)\n\nIn prison, Mingaud had access to a billiard-table and so studied the game of billiards. In this age of simple wooden cues, others had experimented with leather tips, but it was Mingaud who perfected both the design and the appropriate playing technique. In or about 1790 a new practice of rounding off the entire tip further decreased slippage. Some publications credit Mingaud with not just the invention of the leather cue tip but with the practice of rounding off a cue's terminus, while other publications ascribe the practice to no particular author. Regardless, application of spin remained a hit or miss affair, with no fine control yet possible, and miscues still \"unavoidable where hard wood came in contact with slippery ivory.\" Application of or \"twist\" (sometimes called \"English\", especially in North America) was at the time an unknown artform.\n\nIn 1807, Mingaud was released from Bicêtre. Mingaud then began to demonstrate his invention and technique in the cafés of Paris. He reportedly developed a repertoire of 40 shots, including glancing blows, side-spin, backspin, topspin and the raised cue 'massé' shots.\n\nMingaud's reputation grew rapidly and he became known as the 'great master of the game'. According to \"Roberts on Billiards\" published in 1893 by John Roberts :\n\"A few years later [after 1807] he became known as the great master of the game. He could nurse a break, screw, and cause his ball to follow with the utmost nicety and certainty.\"\n\nMingaud is also credited with the discovery that by raising the cue vertically, to the position adopted by the mace (The forerunner of the cue, similar to a light-weight golf club, with a square-fronted foot that was generally used to shove rather than strike the cue ball.), he could perform what is now known as a shot.\n\nIn 1827, Mingaud published a book in Paris titled \"Noble Jeu de Billiard - Coups extraordinaires et surprenans.\" (\"The Noble Game of Billiards. Extraordinary and surprising strokes\") It contained 43 copper-plate images and precise instructions for performing 70 strokes.\n\nCirca 1830, this book was translated and published in English by the Billiards table Manufacturer John Thurston of 14 Catherine Street, The Strand. It was published in English as :\n\"Extraordinary and surprising strokes which have excited the admiration of most of the Sovereigns of Europe.\"\n\nRobert Byrne's 1982 book \"Byrne's Treasury of Trick Shots in Pool and Billiards\" indicated only two copies of the original work were known to exist in the USA: one in the Library of Congress, and one at University of Notre Dame. However, a digitized version of the 1831 second edition of Thurston's translation is now freely available.\n\nHe died in 1847 and his grave is in the churchyard at Kralingen-Crooswijk, a suburb of Rotterdam.\n\nIn Spanish, \"Mingo\" is slang for the red ball used in carom billiards. It is named after Mingaud.\n\nIn the 1990s, Cees Sprangers, Dongen, The Netherlands, began to research the 'lost mystery' that Mingaud had become. His results were for a first time published in the Dutch monthly magazine 'Biljart' in May 1991 and November 1992, later on in essay form in 1994 in Victor Stein and Paul Rubino's \"Billiard Encyclopedia\". He revealed many details of Mingaud's life, including his first name, fleshed out his personal history, and to a large extent, clarified the details on his role in the invention of the leather cue tip.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "374219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=374219", "title": "Hora (dance)", "text": "Hora (dance)\n\nHora, also known as horo and oro, is a type of circle dance originating in the Balkans but also found in other countries.\n\nThe name (spelled differently in different countries) is cognate to the Greek (\"choros\"): \"dance\" which is cognate with the ancient Greek art form of (\"choreia\"). The original meaning of the Greek word may have been \"circle\". The course of the seasons was also symbolically described as the dance of the Greco-Roman , and they were accordingly given the attributes of spring flowers, fragrance and graceful freshness.\n\nAlso, the words \"hora\" and \"oro\" are found in many Slavic languages and have the meaning of \"round (dance)\"; the verb \"oriti\" means \"to speak, sound, sing\" and previously meant \"to celebrate\".\n\nThe Greek is cognate with Pontic , Bulgarian (), Romanian , or оро (\"oro\") in the languages of the former Yugoslavia, the Turkish form , in Albania, and in Hebrew (). The dance of Georgia also might be connected to the Horon dance in the neighbouring Turkish regions, as it rose out of the Adjara region, where Kartvelian Laz people co-existed for centuries with Greek Pontians.\n\nHora (pl. \"hore\") is a traditional Romanian folk dance where the dancers hold each other's hands and the circle spins, usually counterclockwise, as each participant follows a sequence of three steps forward and one step back. The dance is usually accompanied by musical instruments such as the cymbalom, accordion, violin, viola, double bass, saxophone, trumpet or the pan pipes.\n\nThe hora is popular during wedding celebrations and festivals, and is an essential part of the social entertainment in rural areas. One of the most famous hore is the \"Hora Unirii\" (Hora of the Union), which became a Romanian patriotic song as a result of being the hymn when Wallachia and Moldavia united to form the Principality of Romania in 1859. During the 2006/2007 New Year's Eve celebration, when Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union, people were dancing \"Hora Bucuriei\" (Hora of Joy) over the boulevards of Bucharest as a tribute to the EU anthem, Ode to Joy (Odă bucuriei). Some of the biggest hora circles can be found on early 20th century movies filmed by the Manakis brothers in Pindus, Greece and performed by local Aromanians.\n\nVariants:\n\nThe traditional Bulgarian dance horo () comes in many shapes. It is not necessary to be in a circle; a curving line of people is also acceptable. The steps used in a horo dance are extremely diverse. The horo may vary between three and seven or eight steps forward and one to five or six steps back, depending on the specific type.\n\nThere are more than five types of horo that are usually danced at every wedding. They differ by the rhythm of the music and the steps taken. There are no two horo dances with similar steps. There are probably over one hundred types of horo dances in the Bulgarian folklore.\n\nIn the past, the horo dance had a social role in Bulgarian society. It was mainly for fun, as a contest of skills, or for show, leading to the development of the variety of horo dances. There are hora for people with little skill that can be learned in five to ten minutes, but there are also very sophisticated dances that cannot be learned unless one is fluent in many of the simpler dances.\n\nMacedonia uses the Cyrillic spelling of \"oro\" (). The origins of Macedonian oro vary from its use in socializing and celebrating, to historical dancing before going into battle. \"Teshkoto\", translated \"The difficult one\", is one of those, danced by men only, the music of which reflects the sorrow and mood of war. The oro is danced in a circle, with men and women holding one another by hand. They are used to celebrate occasions such as weddings, christenings, name-days, national and religious holidays, graduations, birthdays.\n\nThe Hora/Oro circle dance should not be confused with the Oro dance in Montenegro and Herzegovina, which is a paired mating dance. Its name comes from the Serbian \"орао\", meaning \"eagle\".\n\nHora is mainly played in Eastern Thrace.\n\nThe Oro is also popular among the Romani people of Eastern Europe, and the dancing is practically the same as that of the neighbouring ethnicities. Romani oros, and Romani music in general, are very well appreciated among non-Romani people in the Balkans, as they also have a reputation as the skilful performers of other folk music there. \n\nThe Horah in klezmer music is the same as the traditional Romanian Hora dance. It has a slow, limping gait in 3/8 time and often leads into a faster and more upbeat freylekh or bulgar.\nThe horah (הורה), which is somewhat different from that of some of the Eastern European countries, is widespread in the Jewish diaspora and played a foundational role in modern Israeli folk dancing. It became the symbol of the reconstruction of the country by the socialistic-agricultural Zionist movement. Although considered traditional, some claim it rose to popularity due to Hora Agadati, named after dancer and choreographer Baruch Agadati and performed for the first time in 1924.\n\nIt is usually performed to Israeli folk songs, and sometimes to Jewish songs, typically to the music of \"Hava Nagila\".\n\nTo start the dance, everybody forms a circle, holding hands or interlocking arms behind their backs or on their shoulders and steps forward toward the right with the left foot, then follows with the right foot. The left foot is then brought back, followed by the right foot. This is done while holding hands and circling together in a fast and cheerful motion to the right. Large groups allow for the creation of several concentric circles.\n\nIn the early days, horah was popular mainly in kibbutzim and small communities. The dancing often continued for hours.\n\nThe horah became popular in group dances throughout Israel, and at weddings and other celebrations by Jews in Israel, the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. The dance appeared in North America in the early 20th century, well before modern Israeli independence, brought directly from Eastern Europe by Jewish immigrants.\n\nAt bar and bat mitzvahs, it is customary to raise the honoree, and sometimes his or her family members, on a chair during the horah. This is also done at many Jewish weddings, following the Israeli tradition.\n\nThe song \"Hora\", sung by Avi Toledano, who represented Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 1982, is based on this dance.\n\n\n"}

Its parent company, iROKO Partners, was founded by Jason Njoku and Bastian Gotter in December 2010, with its headquarters in London, United Kingdom. Dubbed the 'Netflix' of Africa, irokotv is the world's largest legal digital distributor of African movies.\n\nWhile living in London iroko's co-founder, Jason Njoku, realised how popular African movies had become. Despite a growing worldwide demand, there was no legal option to watch movies from his home country. He therefore decided to take matters in his own hands and negotiate licensing deals with local Nigerian producers.\n\nThe irokotv website was launched on 1 December 2011 by iROKO Partners, who are one of the largest licensors and distributors of Nollywood movies. Jason Njoku, the company's CEO and Bastian Gotter, now COO, met whilst students together at the University of Manchester together.\n\nNjoku made several attempts to set up his own companies in the immediate years after university, but failed on each attempt. Njoku was inspired to start the company when he found it difficult to obtain Nollywood movies online for his mother, who he was living with at the time. Having researched the Nollywood industry, and noting the lack of infrastructure in place for international distribution of the movies, Njoku flew to Lagos, Nigeria, and purchased the online licenses of Nollywood movies directly from the producers. Having struck a deal with YouTube in Germany, he used the Google-owned platform to stream the licensed Nollywood movies, for free, on his channel, Nollywoodlove.\nThe channel became hugely popular and was profitable in a short period of time and was the focus of a number of press features in international press, including \"CNBC\", \"CNN\" and Techcrunch. The success of Nollywoodlove led to a successful investment from US-based hedge fund Tiger Global Management, who led a two-round investment totalling US$8 million, making it one of the biggest single investments into a West African Dot-com venture. A further investment round of $2m, led by Swedish-based hedge fund Kinnevik, followed in July 2012. The company has, in total, raised $25m of investment, making it one of the most well funded West African internet companies to-date.\n\nirokotv works with most of Nollywood's top film production houses and purchases the exclusive online licenses to their films, In an attempt to distribute Nollywood films to a global audience.

Njoku is often recognised by his peers and in the media as a pioneer in African tech start-ups and in 2012 was voted by Black Enterprise Magazine as one of London's top black men of power.\n\n\nirokotv operates a subscription business model where users can access Nollywood movies via an Android App in Africa, and via an app or online in the West.

After keeping Taskmaster and Black Ant alive and persuading them to become her personal guards, Elisa then collects a new Hydra High Council consisting of herself, a new Kraken, Gorgon, Hive, Viper, Baron Helmut Zemo, Arnim Zola, and Doctor Faustus.\n\nDuring the \"Opening Salvo\" part of the \"Secret Empire\" storyline, Elisa reunites with Captain America after he overthrew Red Skull for leadership of Hydra. While in her study room following Hydra's takeover of the United States, Elisa uses her magic spells to counter every one of Doctor Strange's attempts to bring down the Darkforce dome that is surrounding Manhattan. While having tea with Captain America, Elisa is informed of Captain America's suspicion about Baron Zemo and Doctor Faustus' disloyalty. Elisa brushes off the suspicion and tells Captain America that they plan to assemble the Cosmic Cube in order to restore Earth to their vision. Elisa later gives Captain America the updates on the members of Hydra's Avengers. She tells him that Scarlet Witch has become unhinged due to her being possessed by Chthon, Vision is still kept under Hydra's control through Arnim Zola's A.I. Virus, and Odinson is still praying to Odin about his troubles like Jane Foster being trapped in an alternate reality. As Captain America prepares to leave, Elisa tells Captain America that he has become like a son to her. During Hydra's attack on the Underground's base at the Mount, Elisa detects an unusual amount of energy in the Mount and rushes in. Madame Hydra arrives and teleports Captain America away at the last second as the Tony Stark A.I. explodes where it destroys the base and Madame Hydra.\n\nIn the \"Heroes Reborn\" reality, Madame Hydra is a terrorist leader. Not much was known about her other than the fact that she answered to Hydra's leader Mandarin, who was actually a robot built by Doctor Doom. She was later killed in battle against Iron Man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1176486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1176486", "title": "Mondo film", "text": "Mondo film\n\nA mondo film (from the Italian word for \"world\") is an exploitation documentary film, sometimes resembling a pseudo-documentary and usually depicting sensational topics, scenes, or situations. Common traits of mondo films include an emphasis on taboo subjects (such as death and sex), portrayals of foreign cultures (which have drawn accusations of ethnocentrism or racism), and staged sequences presented as genuine documentary footage. Over time, the films placed increasing emphasis on footage of the dead and dying (both real and fake). The term shockumentary is also used to describe the genre.\n\nAlthough earlier films such as \"European Nights\" (1959) and \"World By Night\" 1 & 2 (1961) may be considered examples of the genre, the origins of the mondo documentary are generally traced to the 1962 Italian film \"Mondo Cane\" (\"A Dog's World\"—a mild Italian profanity) by Paolo Cavara, Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi which was a commercial success.\n\nDocumentary films imitating \"Mondo Cane\" in the 1960s often included the term \"mondo\" in their titles, even if they were in English; examples include \"Mondo Bizarro\", \"Mondo Daytona\", \"Mondo Mod\", \"Mondo Infame\" and \"Mondo Hollywood\". Films outside the genre followed suit: \"Mondo Trasho\", \"Mondo Weirdo: A Trip to Paranoia Paradise\", \"Mondo Keyhole\" and \"Mondo Brutale\" (a German release of Wes Craven's \"The Last House on the Left\") title themselves \"mondo\", although none are mondo documentaries. Later in the decade, this naming convention began to fall out of favour and fewer mondo films identified themselves as such in their titles.\n\nFilmmakers wanted to top each other in shock value to attract audiences. Cruelty to animals, accidents, tribal-initiation rites and surgeries are features of a typical mondo. Much of the action is staged, although the filmmakers may claim their goal is to document \"reality\". Subjects of mondo films include sex (\"Mondo Sex\" and \"Mondo Sexualis USA\"); celebrities (\"Mondo Elvis\" and \"Mondo Lugosi\"); youth culture (\"Mondo Teeno\") and the gay subculture (\"Mondo Rocco\").\n\nRuss Meyer's film \"Mondo Topless\" was one of the few \"documentaries\" restricted to the old midnight movie circuit in the pre-VCR era; it explored strip clubs in 1960s San Francisco at a time when strip clubs were a novelty in the United States, restricted to centers of port-city decadence (such as San Francisco). Other examples of this genre include \"Mondo New York\" by Harvey Keith, \"Mondo di Notte\" by Gianni Proia and \"Mondo Balordo\" by Roberto Bianchi Montero.\n\nThe 1980s saw a resurgence of mondo movies focusing almost exclusively on (onscreen) death, instead of world cultures. The \"Faces of Death\" series is a notable example of this type of mondo (or \"death\") movie. The producers used fake footage (passed off as real), but some of the footage was legitimate (including scenes of autopsies, suicides and accidents).\n\nThe rare 1985 film \"Mondo Senza Veli\" (\"World Without Veils\" or \"Mondo Fresh\") was purported by viewers to feature at its end the brutal execution of a young Arab rapist by public rectal impalement. This episode was, however, believed to have been a staged execution by some viewers.\n\nMondo films in the 21st century feature gore, exemplified by the \"Faces of Gore\" and \"Traces of Death\" series. There is less fake footage, and many use news footage of accidents from East Asia.\n\nA number of films have parodied the genre. Examples include Ricardo Fratelli's \" Mondo Ford\"; \"Mr. Mike's Mondo Video\" by \"Saturday Night Live\"'s Michael O'Donoghue and \"Is There Sex After Death?\" by Jeanne and Alan Abel. \"Mondo Beyondo\" spoofed the films' approach to titling, but was a parody of satellite television. The Italian cannibal film is arguably an offshoot of the mondo film.\n\nThe original mondo film series was the \"Mondo Cane\" series by Gualtiero Jacopetti, Paolo Cavara, and Franco Prosperi. When this type of film proved successful, many imitators followed.\n\nThe pair's \"Mondo candido\" (1975) is not a \"Mondo\" film; the title was imposed on them by the studio, who wished to cash in on their earlier successes. The film is a retelling of Voltaire's novel, \"Candide\".\n\nIn the late 1980s Stelvio Massi (a.k.a. Max Steele) made two spinoffs of the original \"Mondo Cane\" series, known as \"Mondo Cane 3\" and \"Mondo Cane 4\" on video.\n\nIn 1969, brothers Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni began to make a series of their own mondo films until the early 1980s. They made five films in all, tying Jacopetti and Prosperi as the most prolific mondo film producers. Each film examines brutal and bizarre behavior on the African continent. Their films are considered some of the most graphic Mondo films ever made.\n\nAntonio Climati, cinematographer to Prosperi and Jacopetti in many mondo films, joined Mario Morra in 1974 to produce their own string of mondo films, known as the Savage Trilogy. Prosperi also produced the films. Climati and Morra were known for staging scenes.\n\nThe 1978 \"Faces of Death\" popularized a Mondo style known as \"death films\", which depicted humans or animals dying in graphic ways.\n\nUwe Schier bought the rights to the \"Mondo Cane\" and \"Faces of Death\" films and released his own entries in both series, consisting largely of footage lifted from other mondo films. \"Faces of Death 5\" draws heavily on \"Death Scenes\"; \"Faces of Death 6\" consists almost entirely of \"Days of Fury\" and \"Mondo Cane IV\" (not to be confused with \"Mondo Cane 2000, l'Incredibile\", Schier's \"Mondo Cane IV\" is in fact the fifth film in the series) lifts from other films (including \"Death Scenes\" and \"Death Faces IV\"). In 1993, Hurricane Pictures edited a mix of scenes featured in \"Addio ultimo uomo\" and \"Shocking Africa\", labeling it the \"fifth chapter\" of the saga (\"Teil V\" in German).\n\nSeveral imitators followed the \"Faces of Death\" series; many used (or were composed entirely of) footage from other mondo films.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "701776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=701776", "title": "Online casino", "text": "Online casino\n\nOnline casinos, also known as virtual casinos or Internet casinos, are online versions of traditional (\"brick and mortar\") casinos. Online casinos enable gamblers to play and wager on casino games through the Internet. It is a prolific form of online gambling.\n\nOnline casinos generally offer odds and payback percentages that are a bit higher than land-based casinos. Some online casinos claim higher payback percentages for slot machine games, and some publish payout percentage audits on their websites. Assuming that the online casino is using an appropriately programmed random number generator, table games like blackjack have an established house edge. The payout percentage for these games are established by the rules of the game.\n\nMany online casinos rent or buy their software from companies like CryptoLogic Inc (now Amaya), International Game Technology, Microgaming, Playtech, Golden Race and Realtime Gaming.\n\nOnline casinos can be divided into two groups based on their interface: web-based and download-only casinos. Some casinos offer both interfaces.\n\nWeb-based online casinos (also known as flash casinos) are websites where users may play casino games without downloading software to their local computer. Games are mainly represented in the browser plugins Macromedia Flash, Macromedia Shockwave, or Java and require browser support for these plugins. Also, bandwidth is needed since all graphics, sounds and animations are loaded through the web via the plugin. Some online casinos also allow gameplay through a HTML interface. Apple devices such as iPod, iPad and iPhone cannot play Flash games as the technology is not supported.\n\nDownload-based online casinos require the download of the software client in order to play and wager on the casino games offered. The online casino software connects to the casino service provider and handles contact without browser support. Download-based online casinos generally run faster than web-based online casinos since the graphics and sound programs are cached by the software client, rather than having to be loaded from the Internet. On the other hand, the initial download and installation of a download-based online casino client does take time. As with any download from the Internet, the risk of the program containing malware exists.\n\nIn a virtual casino game, the outcome of each game is dependent on the data produced by a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG). This determines the order of the cards in card games, the outcome of a dice throw, or the results produced by the spinning of a slot machine or roulette wheel. PRNGs use a set of mathematical instructions known as an algorithm to generate a long stream of numbers that give the impression of true randomness. While this is not the same as true random number generation (computers are incapable of this without an external input source), it provides results that satisfy all but the most stringent requirements for true randomness.\n\nWhen implemented correctly, a PRNG algorithm such as the Mersenne Twister will ensure that the games are both fair and unpredictable. However, usually the player has to trust that the software has not been rigged to increase the house edge, as its inner workings are invisible to the user. Properly regulated online casinos are audited externally by independent regulators to ensure that their win percentages are in line with the stated odds, and this can provide a degree of assurance to the player that the games are fair, assuming the player trusts the regulator.\n\nIn a live casino game, a human dealer runs the game in real time from a casino gaming table, which can be seen via a live streaming video link. Players can make betting decisions via a console on their computer screen, and can communicate with the dealer using a text chat function.\n\nThe results of the physical transactions by the dealer, such as the outcome of the roulette wheel spin or the dealing of cards, are translated into data that can be utilized by the software by means of optical character recognition (OCR) technology. This enables the player to interact with the game in much the same way as they would with a virtual casino game, except for the fact that the results are determined by real-life actions rather than automated processes.\n\nThese games are a lot more expensive for websites to host than virtual games, as they involve a heavier investment in technology and staffing. A live casino studio typically employs one or more cameramen, several croupiers running the various games, an information technology manager to ensure that any technical hitches are dealt with swiftly, and a pit boss that acts as an adjudicator in case of disputes between players and croupiers.\n\nIn most cases this requires at least a three-room setup, comprising a live studio, a server/software room, and an analyst’s room. The configuration of these rooms varies from casino to casino, with some having several gaming tables in one room, and some having a single table in each room.\n\nThe high running costs involved with operating live dealer games is the reason why online casinos only tend to offer a handful of the most popular games in this format, such as roulette, blackjack, sic bo, and baccarat. In comparison, the running costs associated with virtual games are very low, and it is not uncommon for online casinos to offer hundreds of different virtual casino games to players on their site.\n\nOnline casinos vary in their approach to the hosting of live games, with some providing live games via their own television channel, and others offering the games exclusively via their website. In the case of televised games, players can often use their mobile phone or television remote controls to place bets instead of doing so via a computer connected to the internet. The most common live dealer games offered at online casinos are baccarat, blackjack and roulette.\n\nA typical selection of gambling games offered at an online casino might include:\n\n\nMany online casinos offer sign-up bonuses to new players making their first deposit, and often on subsequent play as well. These bonuses are a form of marketing that may incur a cost (potentially justifiable in order to attract a new player who may return and deposit many more times), since the casino is essentially giving away money in return for a commitment from the player to wager a certain minimum amount before they are allowed to withdraw. Since all casino games have a house edge, the wagering requirements ensure that the player cannot simply walk away with the casino's money immediately after claiming the bonus. These wagering requirements are commonly set to be sufficiently high that the player has a negative expectation, exactly as if they had deposited and not claimed a bonus.\n\nCasinos may choose to restrict certain games from fulfilling the wagering requirements, either to restrict players from playing low-edge games or to restrict 'risk-free' play (betting for instance both red and black on roulette), thereby completing the wagering requirement with a guaranteed profit after the bonus is taken into account.\n\nThe Welcome bonus is a deposit match bonus on the first deposit ever made in the casino or casino group. Welcome bonuses sometimes come in packages and may be given to match the first two or three deposits (First Deposit Welcome Bonus, Second Deposit Welcome Bonus, etc.). They can also be tied to specific games, such as the Welcome Slots Bonus or the Welcome Table Games Bonus. The casino may also offer Welcome bonuses for high rollers who make an initial deposit above the standard amount limit.\n\nThere are two types of Referral bonuses: one for the Referee and one for the Referrer. The Referee gets a bonus when he or she registers an account at the casino and mentions the Referrer. The Referrer gets a bonus when the Referee completes all the requirements, such as making the deposit and wagering it a certain number of times.\n\nCashback or Insurance bonuses are offered as a percentage of all losses in the player’s previous gaming activity. Typically, only deposits that were not matched with bonuses count towards this bonus. You can additionally find websites that offer casino cashback payments based your losses encountered while playing with one or more online casinos. Those type of cashback deals are usually paid back to players by the casino portal that offers those special cashback offers.\n\nThe most popular form of bonus is one that can be claimed without the need to deposit any of the player's own money - known as a no deposit bonus. These bonuses are used as acquisition tools by casinos wishing to attract new players. No deposit bonuses don't always take the form of real cash, as exemplified below.\n\nNon-cashable bonuses may be called \"sticky\" or \"phantom\" bonuses. See \"sticky bonus\" and \"phantom bonus\"</ref> In both cases, the bonus forms a part of the player's balance, but cannot be cashed out. The difference between cash-able and phantom bonuses comes at cashout time. A phantom bonus is deducted from player's balance at the moment he places his withdrawal request. For example: if you deposited $100, received a $100, played and finished the wagering with $150. If the bonus is sticky, the player will be able to withdraw just $50. If bonus is cash-able, then the whole balance is available for withdrawal.\n\nComps are commonly available at land-based casinos, but also exist online. Comp points can usually be exchanged for cash, prizes, or other comps. The amount of cash given per wager is usually very small and often varies with game selection. A casino might offer three comp points for each $10 wagered on slots and one comp point for each $10 wagered on blackjack. The casino might give $1 for each 100 comp points. This example is equivalent to returning 0.3% of wagers on slots and 0.1% of wagers on blackjack. In addition online casinos may offer comps such as free tickets to online tournaments, free slots online, tickets to other special events, extra bonuses, souvenirs and pay back.\n\nBonus hunting (also known as bonus bagging or bonus whoring) is a type of advantage gambling where turning a profit from casino, sportsbook and poker room bonus situations is mathematically possible. For example, the house edge in blackjack is roughly 0.5%. If a player is offered a $100 cashable bonus requiring $5000 in wagering on blackjack with a house edge of 0.5%, the expected loss is $25. Therefore, the player has an expected gain of $75 after claiming the $100 bonus.\n\nA large portion of online casino disputes relate to bonuses. Casinos may label players who win using bonuses as \"bonus abusers.\" Both players and casinos may commit fraud. An example of player fraud is creating multiple accounts and using the accounts to claim a sign-up bonus several times. An example of casino fraud is changing terms of a bonus after a player has completed the wagering requirements, then requiring the player to meet the new bonus terms.\n\nFraudulent behaviour on the part of online casinos has been documented, almost exclusively by player advocacy websites and forums. The most commonly reported behaviour is a refusal to pay withdrawals to legitimate winners. An online casino with multiple confirmed cases of fraudulent behavior is often called a rogue casino by the online casino player community.\n\nMany casino gambling portals and player forums maintain blacklists of rogue casinos. While some carry more authority than others, all blacklists constitute individual webmaster and player opinions rather than an official list from any type of regulating body.\n\nOften, casinos use buffer sites that offer free play of their casino games but in reality use different means of deceptive strategies to redirect or lure the visitors into signing up to their services via appealing bonus offers or exclusive reward programs. Majority of these deceptive \"free\" sites lead to equally deceptive casinos.\n\nSince almost all existing online casinos offer free play of their casino games, recognising whether a casino is deceptive based on whether they offer free gameplay is no longer viable.\n\nOnline gambling legislation often has loopholes that result from the rapid development of the technology underpinning the development of the industry. Some countries, including Belgium, Canada, Finland and Sweden have state gambling monopolies and do not grant licenses to foreign casino operators. According to their law, operators licensed on the territory of these countries can only be considered legal. At the same time, they can't prosecute foreign casino operators and only block their sites. Players in these countries can't be punished and can gamble at any site they can access.\n\nThe Australian Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (IGA) criminalises the supply of online casino games by an operator anywhere in the world to persons located in Australia. It only targets operators of online gambling sites, resulting in the curious situation that it is not illegal for a player in Australia to access and gamble at an online casino. No operator has even been charged with an offence under the IGA and many online casinos accept Australian customers. In June 2016, the South Australian Government became the first state or territory in the world to introduce a 15% Place Of Consumption Tax (POCT) modelled on the 2014 UK POCT.\n\nThe Belgian Gaming Act went into effect in January 2011 and allows online gambling, but only under very strict conditions and surveillance.\n\nThe Canadian criminal code states that only provincial governments and charitable organizations licensed by provincial governments may operate a casino in Canada. It also prohibits residents from participating in any lottery scheme, game of chance, or gambling activity not licensed or operated by a provincial government. In 2010, the British Columbia Lottery Corporation launched Canada’s first legal online casino, PlayNow, which is available to residents of British Columbia. The province of Quebec also operates a legal online casino through Loto-Québec.\n\nDespite this legislation, the Kahnawake First Nation in Quebec has taken the position that it is a sovereign nation, able to enact its own gambling legislation, and has licensed and hosted nearly 350 gambling websites, without ever being prosecuted.\n\nThe German Online Casino Legislative 2012 (EU) many will often describes as very complex matter.The European Commission via the \"EU Pilot\" scheme recently questioned Germany about what steps it plans to take to eliminate the current sports-betting monopoly operated by state-owned Oddset and to also reconsider its stance on prohibiting online casino and poker games due to the huge gray market currently existing — and prospering — in the country.\nLatest strike to the German Legislative was from Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU) recently ruled against the country's restrictive online gaming laws where is clearly stated\"Further to a judgment of the Court from which it can be inferred that a national law is not compatible with EU law, all organs of a Member State concerned are under an obligation to remedy that situation,\" Judge Advocate General Szpunar stated in 2015 year.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Gambling Bill that was passed into law in 2005 tends to all matters of online gambling, permitting online betting sites to have a Remote Gambling Licence in order to offer online betting to UK citizens. In 2014, the UK government put into law the Gambling Act of 2014 which in addition to the original 2005 law, required offshore online gambling operators catering to UK players to obtain a UK license. The new regulation required operators to pay a 15% Place of Consumption Tax (POCT), something that triggered an exodus of sorts of some operators from the British Isles. However, this exodus did not last long in most cases as the benefits outweighed the stumbling blocks, due to the UK being a major market for online gambling.\n\nIn the United States, the legality of online gambling is debated and can vary from state to state. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA) limits the ability of banks and payment processors to transact with internet gambling sites that are unlawful under any federal or state law. However it does not define the legality or otherwise of an internet based gambling site. It was commonly assumed that the Federal Wire Act prohibited all forms of online gambling. However, in December 2011, the United States Department of Justice released a statement clarifying that the Wire Act applied only to sports betting sites and not to online casinos, poker, or lottery sites, leaving the definition of legality up to individual states. Certain states such as Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey have started the process of legalising and regulating online gambling and it is expected that regulation will continue on a state by state basis.\n\n"}

(Equal to a G rating on DVD)\n\nA programme that would be acceptable to all audiences and tastes. This may be or seem like a low rating, but in fact, some of the shows which receive this rating on TV, would actually receive a PG or a 12 certificate on DVD/Blu-ray. No programmes or films are edited or trimmed to fit the classification. Examples of programmes issued this rating include \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\", \"Neighbours\", \"The Simpsons\". Programmes with a GA rating are sometimes similar to a PS rating. Children's/family programmes such as \"Sabrina\" (above), will in all cases be GA (or Ch), but other GA (PS and YA) shows such as \"Neighbours\" and \"The Simpsons\" (above) will feature storylines with adult themes, in which case would reveive the PG or 12 rating on DVD/Blu-ray. (Shows with this rating are usually equal to a PG/12 rating on DVD)\n\nA programme aimed at a mature audience, i.e. It might deal with adult themes, be moderately violent, frightening or contain an occasional swear word. And the classification label invites parents and guardians to consider restricting children's access. Examples of programmes issued this rating include \"Home and Away\", \"Packed to the Rafters\", \"Desperate Housewives\", \"Brothers & Sisters\". (Shows with this rating are usually equal to a 12/15 rating on DVD)\n\nA typical 'post-watershed' programme which might contain scenes of sexual activity or violence, or the dialogue might be profane. Examples of programmes issued this rating include \"Shameless\", \"Mrs. Brown's Boys\". (Shows with this rating are usually equal to a 15/18 rating on DVD)\n\nThis would be a programme or film aimed at a teenage audience, which means it may contain adult or mature themes. That is to say that it would not be of great interest to an adult older than 18. However, it may deal with issues which affect the teenage audience, e.g. relationships, sexual activity, sexuality and drug use. Parents and guardians could expect that YA programmes or films might contain such material and may choose to limit their children's access. The YA rating has fallen much into disuse as the GA and PS ratings cover teen storylines in both television and film, GA and PS do cover such things that are not suitable for children. Examples of programmes issued this rating include \"Home and Away\"\n\nThe typical RTÉ One schedule is aimed at an adult audience, the 18-49 demographic, with daytime covering GA, PS and YA programmes. GA either being shows such as reality shows which may be of no interest to children or reality shows such as \"Dr. Phil\", which may also receive a PS rating for adult-themed content. The soaps \"Home and Away\", which is aired fully uncut, \"Neighbours\", \"EastEnders\", New Zealand soap \"Shortland Street\", and RTÉ One soap \"Fair City\", they all receive GA, PS and YA ratings, the rest of daytime is made up of drama series and sitcoms and films at the weekend. Programmes and films with an MA rating can only be aired after the watershed (9.00pm), with the exception of several episodes of \"Home and Away\", which has received this rating before, and sitcoms such as \"Grounded for Life\", which has also received this rating in some episodes before 9.00pm. RTÉ News and Current Affairs programmes don't receive a classification.\n\nRTÉ Two's schedule is made up of children's, teenagers and adult programming. On weekday mornings, the children's programming blocks RTÉjr (pre-school children) and TRTÉ (teenage show which are suitable for children's viewing) usually airs between 6.45am and 5.35pm. Weekday evenings at 5.35pm the teen/adult programming block, Two Tube begins with \"Neighbours\", \"The Simpsons\" and \"Home and Away\", the shows on Two Tube are aimed at the 15-24 demographic. 7.00pm-9.00pm and after 9pm are aimed at an adult audience and would air programmes and films with all classifications. On weekends, the children's programming blocks usually air from 6.45am to 11.45am, from 11.45am the schedule returns to normal programming aimed at an adult audience beginning with the re-run episodes of the week's \"Home and Away\" and the rest of the day and night's programming made up of drama series, sitcoms and films, apart from a children's/family film which could be shown both Saturday and Sunday during the day, and \"The Sunday Game\" which is shown on Sunday afternoons. Apart from the children's programming blocks, the rest of RTÉ Two's programming, including the programmes on Two Tube runs much like RTÉ One's schedule.\n\nDuring Holidays such as Christmas, Easter, Halloween or the summer holidays, children's or family films air during the day on both RTÉ One and RTÉ Two.\n\n\n"}

Along with children and teens of this age, Teen Musical Theater will sometimes add \"Guest Stars\" to the shows who take on roles such as Daddy Warbucks in Annie and The Man In Chair from The Drowsy Chaperone. TMTO will generally put on three productions a year - a spring show, a summer show, and a winter show. TMTO will occasionally produce concerts with a smaller, selected cast.\n\nTeen Musical Theater began back in 2006 with a spring production of Grease. At that time the production was called Children's Musical Theater of Ashland (CMTA) until it was later renamed Children's Musical Theater of Oregon (CMTO). The company was founded by composer and keyboardist John Taylor and his wife Rhonda Taylor. His inspiration to found this organization came from the impact John P. Healy Jr. had on him when he was a part of San Jose Children's Musical Theater. Shortly after the 2008 summer production of Oklahoma!, Children's Musical Theater of Oregon was adopted by Craterian Performances. During the spring 2010 performance of Will Rogers Follies, a new branch of Children's Musical Theater of Oregon was created, called Teen Musical Theater of Oregon. While CMTO is still a working entity of the organization, it has taken a back seat allowing TMTO to produce the majority of the Musical Theater of Oregon's productions.\n\nThe company has made three original productions: Broadway: A Musical Journey, Broadway II: The Journey Continues, and Moving On: TMTO in Concert. The first two being revues of many Broadway songs from many different Broadway shows including Lion King, Damn Yankees, A Chorus Line, The Color Purple and Hairspray. The Broadway series was created as a collaboration between John Taylor and David McCandless. Moving On was created and directed by Cailey McCandless and was a sendoff concert for eight graduating seniors who had participated in TMTO for years.\n"}

This episode introduces Kyle's cousin Kyle. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have stated the story was inspired by the Segway PT and the general chaotic nature of airports at the time of the production, shortly following 9/11 and the 2001 airline bailout.\n\nIn the episode, Kyle's cousin Kyle, a Jewish stereotype, comes to South Park for a visit. Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison comes up with a \"more pleasant\" alternative to airline travel, known as \"IT\".\n\nKyle's cousin, Kyle Schwartz from Connecticut, comes to live in South Park due to his mother's ailing health back at home. While Kyle was initially excited about seeing his cousin for the first time, he is baffled to see that his cousin is none other than an overly stereotyped version of a Jew, wearing his hair in a style similar to Woody Allen, and has a lot of irritating characteristics. Kyle is told by his mother to take care of his cousin. Kyle, fearing that Cartman, a staunch anti-Semite, will \"tear this kid apart\", attempts to bribe Cartman with $40 to not make fun of him. Cartman, in an attempt to earn the bribe, struggles to avoid mocking Kyle's cousin, but eventually fails. The boys decide that Kyle's cousin is just way too irritating to live in South Park with them. Much of the episode proceeds to have the boys make constant attempts to get rid of Kyle Schwartz. In one attempt to trick him into boarding a plane to Antarctica, Kenny is mistaken for a terrorist and shot through the head. However, Kyle's cousin always finds a way to come back to South Park.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Garrison, annoyed and fed up with the inefficient and frustrating airline check-ins since 9/11, decides to invent his own vehicle. Inspired by watching Enrique Iglesias' sexualized singing on TV and by a gyroscope sitting next to him on his deck, he invents the gyroscope-powered monowheel \"IT\". According to Mr. Garrison, \"IT\" can \"go up to two hundred miles per hour, and gets three hundred miles to the gallon\". The only problem is that \"IT\" is controlled through a quite painful and unappealing method; using four \"flexi-grip handles\" that somewhat resemble erect penises; two held in the hands, one in the mouth, and a fourth handle which is inserted into the anus. Garrison invites many important investors to see his demonstration of \"IT\". Despite this unorthodox control mechanism, \"IT\" is still considered better than dealing with the airlines and Garrison's creation is a smashing success. This results in a lack of passengers and business in airports.\n\nUnfortunately, things go downhill when the government decides to bail out the airlines from going under because of \"IT\". To ensure the airlines' dominance as a mode of transport and the job security of everyone working for it, the government ends up outlawing \"IT\", deems using it a criminal act and confiscates all of the \"IT\" stock. As a result, Kyle's cousin, who turns out to have invested in \"IT\", gets a $5 million bailout payment and decides to return home to Connecticut to take care of his sick mother. After hearing of this great fortune, the boys suddenly change their plan and try to convince him to stay with them, but he rejects them.\n\nAccording to the creator commentary, the depiction of Kyle's cousin was partially based on their experience working with radio host Dennis Prager.\n\n\"The Entity\", along with the fourteen other episodes from \"South Park: the Complete Fifth Season\", were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The set includes brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.\n\n"}

Harpur claims that the New Testament shares a large number of similarities with ancient Egyptian and other pagan religions, that early Church leaders fabricated a literal and human Jesus based on ancient myths, and that we should return to an inclusive and universal religion where the spirit of Christ or Christos lives within each of us.\n\nThe book was named the Canadian non-fiction bestseller of the year by both the \"Toronto Star\" and \"The Globe and Mail\". It was later released under the title The Pagan Christ: Is Blind Faith Killing Christianity? in the United States by Walker Books and in Australia by Allen Unwin. It has also been published in five foreign languages: in Montreal (\"Le Christ païen\") by Éditions du Boréal, in the Netherlands (\"De heidense Christus\") by Ankh-Hermes bv, in Germany (\"Der heidnische Heiland\") by Ansata Verlag, in Brazil (\"O Cristo Dos Pagaos\") by Editora Cultrix-Pensamento and in Japan (異教キリスト) by Basilico. In 2007, the book became the basis for a CBC documentary, and that same year, Harpur published a more scholarly sequel entitled \n\"Water Into Wine: An Empowering Vision of the Gospels\".\n\nThroughout the book, Harpur details stories and sayings in the New Testament which he claims also appear in ancient myths, particularly pointing out the similarities between Jesus and the Egyptian sun god Horus. He states that a number of pagan cultures in different regions and time periods drew on symbolic themes such as virgin birth, deity father, star in the east, raising of the dead, descent into hell, crucifixion, resurrection, and others. Harpur claims that virtually all words and actions attributed to Jesus in the gospels \"originated thousands of years before.\" Although early church leaders such as Justin Martyr and St. Augustine reportedly acknowledged certain commonalities between pagan religions and Christianity, Harpur explains that the extent of these similarities was hidden until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799.\n\nAccording to Harpur, most modern biblical scholars agree the gospels were written many decades after the presumed death of Jesus, and he concludes the scriptures are inconsistent, inaccurate and do not represent a verifiable historical record. Harpur even makes the case that the original authors of the New Testament set out to combine popular pagan myths with prophecies of the Old Testament, never intending for readers to take these allegorical stories literally. In what he calls \"one of the most far-reaching tragedies in history,\" he presents the case that the Christian church in the third and fourth centuries \"made a fatal and fateful error,\" namely inventing the myth of a literal and historical Jesus based on \"sublime truth.\" He further suggests that ultra-conservative Christianists \"did everything in their power, through forgery and other fraud, book burning, character assassination, and murder itself, to destroy the crucial evidence.\" According to Harpur's sources, their propaganda included selectively editing the scriptures and inserting false passages about Jesus into the text of the Jewish historian Josephus.\n\nAsking the question, \"can we say with any authority that Jesus of Nazareth actually existed as historical person\", he concludes, \"I have a very grave doubts we can,\" adding that his gradual realization that Jesus was a \"mythical copy of many preceding saviours\" was difficult to accept himself. Consistent with the Jesus myth theory, Harpur contends, \"there is no hard historical evidence for Jesus' existence,\" and \"no contemporary non-Christian writer even knew of Jesus.\" Noting his belief that the Pauline epistles or letters of Saint Paul (which were written before the four gospels), do not mention the parables and miracles of Christ, and make no reference to biographical details like Nazareth, Harpur concludes, \"I am compelled, therefore, by my own independent research to agree that Paul's Christ was not Jesus of Nazareth.\" To that end, he states that biblical literalism \"commits idolatry by making a flesh-and-blood man into God,\" and that worshiping a perfect superman with magical powers who supposedly lived 2000 years ago is not a sustainable path for the future of Christianity.\n\nOn Harpur's website and jacket cover, \"The Pagan Christ\" is said to reveal \"a cosmic faith built on these truths that the modern church has renounced\", and calling for a \"return to an inclusive religion where Christ lives within each of us.\" According to Harpur, he has spent his entire life searching for answers, and now that he understands the scriptures represent symbolic allegories on a central theme rather than cryptic history, God seems more \"relevant and real,\" and \"the Bible comes alive wholly in a new way.\" Instead of challenging his religious faith, Harpur attests that his discoveries \"have made a joyous and life-changing imprint,\" which have \"transformed my view of the future of Christianity it into one of hope.\"\n\nThe bibliography for \"The Pagan Christ\" contains over 80 published authors who are cited in the book. Harpur has been studying the classics and the Bible since he was a Rhodes Scholar in the early 1950s, and he draws on individuals as diverse as St. Augustine and Sigmund Freud for supporting quotes. However, he bases many of his arguments on the writings of relatively unknown authors Alvin Boyd Kuhn (to whom the book is dedicated), Gerald Massey and Godfrey Higgins. He also opens himself to criticism by quoting contemporary atheists such as Earl Doherty and Acharya S, who are often targeted by biblical literalists and apologists. As for \"scholars and critics who believe that Jesus was not historical\", Harpur presents a list from American historian Harry Elmer Barnes, that was first published 1929, featuring Bruno Bauer, Albert Kalthoff, Arthur Drews, J. C. Stendel, , Peter Jensen, Samuel Lublinski, Gerard Bolland, Gustaaf van den Bergh, Charles Virolleaud, Paul-Louis Couchoud, Gerald Massey, Emilio Bossi, Georg Brandes, J. M. Robertson, G.R.S. Mead, Thomas Whittaker, Edward Carpenter and W. B. Smith. (Andrzej Niemojewski and Deye were noted in the original Barnes list but omitted from the list in \"The Pagan Christ\") (note; Stendel may be a transcription error of and Deye of Albert Bayet)\n\nIn December 2007, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired a documentary called \"The Pagan Christ\", based on Harpur's book, as part of its Doc Zone series. Filmed by Bank Productions, it was one of the most-watched television documentaries in Canada that year and received mostly favourable comments on the CBC website. The program won the Platinumo Remi Award at the Houston International Film Festival and the Golden Camera Award for best documentary at the U.S. International Film and Video Festival in Redondo Beach, California.\n\n\"The Pagan Christ\" joins a list of documentaries with sensational claims against orthodox Christianity that have originally aired before either Christmas or Easter, that includes \"Bible Secrets Revealed\" (November to December, 2013) and \"The Lost Tomb of Christ\" (March, 2007).\n\nIn a 2004 article entitled \"The Leading Religion Writer in Canada ... Does He Know What He's Talking About?\", Vancouver-based pastor W. Ward Gasque strongly critiques \"The Pagan Christ,\" claiming the \"evidence for Jesus as a historical personage is incontrovertible.\" He reports that only one of the ten Egyptologists who responded to his emails (nine of whom were not identified) were familiar with Kuhn, Higgins and Massey, and that they unanimously dismissed an Egyptian etymology for Jesus.\n\nRon Leprohon, Professor of Egyptology at the University of Toronto, has demonstrated that Harpur and his mentor, Alvin Boyd Kuhn, were wrong on at least one point. Harpur and Kuhn's claim that the Egyptian deity Horus and Jesus are the same deity is based on faulty syntax. 'In any event, the name 'Iusa' simply does not exist in Egyptian.'\n\nJames A. Beverley, author and professor at Tyndale Seminary in Toronto, wrote a brief article in 2004 called \"The Pagan Tom Harpur\" for the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, using a more light-hearted tone than the title suggested.\n\nStanley E. Porter and Stephen J. Bedard offer a refutation of Harpur's ideas from an evangelical standpoint in \"Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea\". The 2006 book from Clements Publishing challenges the key ideas lying at the foundation of Harpur's thesis. Porter, president and dean of McMaster Divinity College in Hamilton, and Stephen J. Bedard, a Baptist minister and graduate of McMaster Divinity, state, 'If the proponents of the Pagan Christ theory had any evidence even close to the quality of The Epic of Gilgamesh material, there would be some reason to consider their claims. Unfortunately for their arguments, their evidence lacks substance and the claims are, therefore, shockingly weak.' Porter and Bedard conclude that there is sufficient evidence for the historicity of Jesus and assert that Harpur is motivated to promote \"universalistic spirituality\". Porter appeared in the CBC documentary, and David Brady Productions approached the authors about creating a counter documentary for Canada's VisionTV in 2008.\n\nPorter's colleague at McMaster Divinity College, Gordon L. Heath, also produced a paper called \"Neither Scholarly or a Solution\" which offers a critique of the book. The author concedes he agrees with Harpur on several points such as their shared aversion to rigid fundamentalism and that the church has done shameful things in the past, but disagrees on most other points.\n\nIn 2009, theologian and author Robert M. Price wrote a review which raised a number of concerns about Harpur's premise and evidence. Price noted that the book \"contains many dubious fact claims\".\n\nBart D. Ehrman Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on his ehrmanblog in 2012 and in his book published the same year, \"Did Jesus Exist? The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth\", lists Harpur along with other \"mythicists\" such as Price, but does not specifically criticize the details in \"The Pagan Christ\".\n\nIn 2013, New Testament scholar Craig A. Evans noted that the views of Harpur and Kuhn have been \"thoroughly refuted and is not followed by any reputable historian or Egyptologist.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "21981842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21981842", "title": "The Power of One (film)", "text": "The Power of One (film)\n\nThe Power of One is a 1992 American drama film based on Bryce Courtenay's 1989 novel \"The Power of One\". Set in South Africa during World War II, the film centers on the life of Peter Philip 'Peekay or PK' Kenneth-Keith, an English South African boy raised under apartheid, and his conflicted relationships with a German pianist, a Coloured boxing coach and an Afrikaner romantic interest. Directed and edited by John G. Avildsen, the film stars Stephen Dorff, John Gielgud, Morgan Freeman, Armin Mueller-Stahl and featured (a then-unknown) Daniel Craig in his film debut.\n\nBorn in 1930 to a recently widowed Englishwoman on a homestead in rural Natal, little Peter Philip (Guy Witcher) is schooled in the ways of England by his mother and the ways of Africa by a Zulu nanny (Nomadlozi Kubheka), whose son Tonderai is also his best friend. Their easy life is forever shattered, however, when the farm's cattle are claimed by \"rinderpest\". PK's mother succumbs to a nervous breakdown, and he is sent away to a conservative Afrikaans boarding school while she recovers.\n\nBeing the only English student at the boarding school, PK soon earns almost universal contempt from his scathing Afrikaner fellows—particularly an older student, Jaapie Botha. Botha's abuse and his inferiority complex strikes PK with a severe case of nocturnal enuresis, a habit which he eventually overcomes with local sangoma Dabula Manzi. In conquering his nightmares, PK is given a chicken (\"Mother Courage\"), which becomes his closest companion. Botha subsequently captures PK and Mother Courage and has them tried before a mock court while elaborating on the depth of his hatred for the British—a people he holds responsible for atrocities committed during the Second Boer War. The Afrikaans boys hang Mother Courage and kill her with a rock. When PK physically retaliates against Botha, they attempt to execute him in a similar manner but are interrupted by a teacher who later oversees Botha's expulsion.\n\nWith his mother dying, PK finds himself living with his grandfather in Barberton. He eventually seeks a mentor in Karl \"Doc\" von Vollensteen (Armin Mueller-Stahl), a lonely German musician who lost his family in Europe. Doc warms to PK and under his guidance the latter soon becomes an excellent pianist. He is interned as an enemy alien at the onset of World War II, but PK continues to visit him regularly in prison. Doc introduces the boy to Geel Piet (Morgan Freeman), a Cape Coloured inmate who takes von Vollensteen's place as PK's mentor, training him to be an excellent boxer. Piet also impresses on PK his mantra: \"first with the head, then with the heart\", a phrase that will see the young man through even greater hard times ahead.\n\nA maturing PK (Simon Fenton) begins to express sympathy towards black prisoners, who are detained under appalling conditions. He works with Doc to distribute contraband among the Africans, writing their letters to home, and sharing their many sufferings. The war does not end happily for PK, as Doc is repatriated and Piet—seriously injured by a white warder—fails to survive his sentence. PK is sent away again, this time to study at the prestigious Prince of Wales School in Johannesburg. While attending a boxing championship, he is enamoured by Maria Marais, daughter of a leading National Party official. Since her strict father will not permit them to see each other openly, they begin dating in secret. On one such outing they are introduced to Gideon Duma, a prominent boxer in Alexandra, a notorious black township. Duma's passion for resisting apartheid inspires PK, and he begins teaching English at a rural African school.\n\nMaria's father, incensed by the couple's ongoing relationship and PK's ties to a multiracial gym, leads him to request a formal investigation by one of his South African Police contacts, Colonel Breyten. Breyten and his sergeant, an embittered Jaapie Botha, place PK under surveillance for subversion. His clashes with the SAP finally come to a head when Maria is killed during a raid on a biracial church by the security forces. Maddened by grief, PK considers fleeing to England, but is consoled by his former boxing partner, who reminds him of all the good he can still do in Africa.\n\nBotha leads a violent raid on Alexandra the following night. He threatens to shoot Elias Mlungisi, the local boxing promoter, only to be confronted by PK. They spar; PK easily bests his childhood enemy. Botha is still bent on executing the erstwhile victor, but an arriving Gideon Duma dispatches the policeman with a cricket bat before he can fire and fractures his skull. Now fugitives from the apartheid government, PK and Duma vow to continue a campaign against racial injustice. Peter's closing narration identifies meaningful voices during his life; from mother and nanny, to Doc and Dabula Manzi, Geel Piet and, finally, Maria Marais.\n\n\nThe film received mixed reviews. Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes currently ranks the film at a 39% 'rotten' rating, based on 18 reviews. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave it two and a half stars out of four, stating that the nature of troubles of South Africa \"are too complex to be reduced to a formula in which everything depends on who shoots who\", but did add \"there are some nice touches,\" such as the locations and Gielgud's performance.\n\nMorgan Freeman later said in an interview that the film \"wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be.\"\n\n"}
