{"id": "42911875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42911875", "title": "1 (2013 film)", "text": "1 (2013 film)\n\n1 (also known as 1: Life On The Limit) is a 2013 documentary film directed by Paul Crowder and narrated by Michael Fassbender. The film traces the history of Formula One auto racing from its early years, in which some seasons had multiple fatalities, to the 1994 death of Ayrton Senna, the sport's most recent death at the time of production. Extensive and often rare archival footage is used throughout.\n\nThe film opens with the 1996 Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne, where Martin Brundle survived a spectacular crash at turn 3. After receiving clearance from race doctor Sid Watkins, Brundle hopped into a spare car to finish the race. The film then takes a brief look at the early days of Formula One racing in the 1950s, which was essentially a resumption of prewar Grand Prix racing. In 1958, the year world champion Juan Manuel Fangio retired, the FIA announced the Formula One World Constructors' Championship for the makers of the winning car. This led to a wave of British privateer teams, nicknamed \"Garagistas\" by Enzo Ferrari, dominating the Championship. Most notable was Team Lotus, led by Colin Chapman.\n\nIn 1966, the FIA doubled the engine size from 1.5 to 3 liters, which saw the cars race markedly faster on tracks and facilities unchanged since before World War II. This resulted in several fatal accidents. The death of Chapman's star driver Jim Clark at the Hockenheimring in a Formula Two race in 1968 was a turning point: several drivers, including Clark's Lotus replacement, Jochen Rindt, and the Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA), began questioning the sport's safety. Rindt himself was killed during practice at the 1970 Italian Grand Prix; he was posthumously awarded the driver's championship that year.\n\nJackie Stewart, three-time champion and Chairman of the GPDA, used his position to push for improved safety and track facilities, including safety barriers and mandatory seat belts. This caused some opposition with other drivers, most notably Jacky Ickx, Stewart's opponent on the track at the time. Stewart's influence led to boycotts of some races, including the 1971 Belgian Grand Prix. Despite his efforts, drivers continued to be killed, including Stewart's own teammate, François Cevert, at the 1973 United States Grand Prix.\n\nMeanwhile, new drivers and teams made their way into Formula One. Hesketh Racing, led by the extravagant Lord Hesketh, entered Formula One in 1973 with their Formula Two driver James Hunt. Despite their rather blasé appearance, they performed surprisingly well including winning the 1975 Dutch Grand Prix ahead of Ferrari's Niki Lauda. When Hesketh was forced to close at the end of 1975, Hunt went to McLaren, which placed both him and Lauda as favorites to win the 1976 Championship.\n\nIn 1978, Bernie Ecclestone, head of the Formula One Constructors Association, hired Professor Sid Watkins as the official Formula One 'race doctor.' Initially distrusted by track officials, Watkins' influence on the sport increased after the death of Ronnie Peterson at the 1978 Italian Grand Prix; at that race, the Italian officials prevented him from treating Peterson at the scene.\n\nFollowing Peterson's accident, Formula One remained relatively fatality free until the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, which saw the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna in separate accidents.\n\nIn the aftermath, the FIA President Max Mosley (who drove in the race Jim Clark was killed in, and was head of March Engineering in the 1970s), formed the Advisory Expert Group chaired by Sid Watkins to research and improve safety in motor racing. As a result of the changes implemented by this Group, Formula One did not experience a driver fatality until 2015, when driver Jules Bianchi succumbed to a head injury 9 months after a crash during the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.\n\n\nCrowder had the idea for creating a \"safety documentary\" about Formula One racing in the 1980s, though production did not begin until 2008. In addition to narration by Michael Fassbender, the documentary features on-screen interviews with Formula One champions Mario Andretti, Jenson Button, Lewis Hamilton, Damon Hill, Jacky Ickx, Niki Lauda, Nigel Mansell, Michael Schumacher, Jackie Stewart, and Sebastian Vettel. Other interviewees include Bernie Ecclestone, head of the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA), Max Mosley, legal adviser to FOCA, and Sid Watkins, head of the Formula One on-track medical team. The majority of the interviews were completed in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe documentary premiered on January 10, 2014 at the Empire, Leicester Square in London, United Kingdom. The sport suffered its first fatality in 2015 as a result of a 2014 accident when Jules Bianchi died on July 17, 2015.\n\n\"1\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on January 28, 2014 in the United States and Canada and on March 17 in the United Kingdom. The Australian Blu-ray release and some DVDs are bundled with \"Rush\".\n\nMike McCahill of \"The Guardian\" gave the documentary 4 stars out of 5, stating, \"This F1 history finds its narrative impetus in the trade-off between crowd pleasing speed and concern for driver survival\". McCahill praised the timing and contextual presentation, and described the film as \"surprisingly critical.\" Mark Kermode of \"The Guardian\" found \"gripping\" the mixture of archive footage and modern-day interviews. Daniel Johnson of \"The Telegraph\" considered the film a \"compelling\" depiction, noting that Formula One racing went beyond \"sport\" to \"high-stakes theatre\" in the fifteen years following 1967, a period in which 19 drivers died. Charlotte O'Sullivan of the \"London Evening Standard\" described the movie as \"pure bliss for Formula 1 fans.\" The film's star power was highlighted by Ian Freer of \"Empire\". \"The Independent\" described the film as \"well-researched\", but noted its \"morbid\" and \"depressing\" elements. Bleacher Report featured columnist Matthew Walthert described the film as an inspiring tragedy told by the living about those who died while quickly driving high-powered and potentially lethal \"mobile bombs.\" The Independent notes the film graphically documents the improvement of safety in the sport.\n\nFassbender's narration was described as both \"sonorous\" and \"laconic\". Ecclestone and Mosley were lauded by reviewers for their \"genuine determination\" and for their roles as \"self-styled guardian angels\".\n\nKermode noted the timing of the film, which opened in the shadow of \"Senna\" (2010) and \"Rush\" (2013). The film is praised for complementing them both. \"The Independent\" described the film as produced alongside \"Rush\". Walthert claimed the film was a response to \"Senna\", which \"raised the bar for F1 filmmaking\" as much as its predecessor. The archival footage is said to be familiar to viewers of those films, but it is said to be \"moving\" and \"smartly marshalled\". British \"GQ\" critic Rebecca Cox described the footage as \"100 per cent real and utterly terrifying\".\n\n"}

{"id": "19932198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19932198", "title": "Accidents Happen", "text": "Accidents Happen\n\nAccidents Happen is a 2010 Australian coming-of-age comedy drama film directed by Andrew Lancaster and starring Geena Davis, Harrison Gilbertson, Sebastian Gregory, Harry Cook (actor), Joel Tobeck, and Sarah Woods. Written by Brian Carbee, based on his own childhood and adolescence, the story revolves around an accident-prone teenage boy and his family. The film was shot in Sydney, New South Wales, over June – July 2008, and opened in Australia on 22 April 2010.\n\nIn 1974, the Conway family are at a drive-in theater in Connecticut watching \"The Three Stooges\". The parents are Gloria (Geena Davis), a foul-mouthed and strict mother who will always take responsibility over the family, Ray (Joel Tobeck), an easy-going father, and siblings Linda, Gene, Larry (Harry Cook (actor)), and Billy (Harrison Gilbertson), who is an accident-prone child. In the meantime, the Conway's neighbor, Douglas \"Doug\" Post (Sebastian Gregory), whom Gloria hates and often calls him names because he is the one who causes problems that could be offensive towards the family, drives by on his bike, and Gene leads him up to the top of the drive-in screen. Gene then proceeds to urinate out of the screen. While an infuriated Gloria trips as she approaches the screen, the police are dispatched to handle the situation as infuriated and confused guests honk at Gene and Doug. While driving back home, an argument over the incident causes their car to collide with a pick-up truck during the rainy night. Although Gloria, Ray, Billy, and Larry only suffer minor injuries, Linda is killed and Gene is severely injured with severe brain damage (that could be fatal in a matter of time) and is left paralyzed from the head down.\n\nIn 1982, eight years after the accident, Ray is divorced and more problems arise not only concerning about Doug, but also about Gene's severe condition, as he could die in any day or any month. Fifteen-year-old Billy is still friends with Doug even after the accident. One night, an argument occurs over a TV dinner with Larry, now a belligerent and profane alcoholic. Billy accidentally knocks over the dinner and it lands on him, burning his back. When Doug overhears what is going on, he intervenes and gets into a short scuffle with Larry, as Billy blames his brother for the burn on his back. After streaking and robbing a convenience store, Billy and Doug are playing when he causes an almighty crash with a bowling ball and a moving car, actually killing Doug's father by accident. Just a few days after the incident, Larry's incessant harassment causes Billy to fight against his older brother, and when Gloria breaks up the scuffle and discovers a gauze on Billy's back (after Billy knocked the TV dinner and injured himself, and on the newspapers regarding the robbery that Billy was wearing the gauze), Larry immediately tells her that Billy and Doug went streaking and stealing things as evidence, but is still taken away by Ray, who came to cause another argument with Gloria over their divorce. Because Billy has no way to hide any of the evidence, an incensed Gloria reprimands and admonishes him, restricting him from seeing Doug permanently. Although she knows what Billy and Doug did, Gloria does not know what really happened at the car crash.\n\nWhen Doug receives a mistaken note that his father committed suicide and that the insurance company does not pay for suicide, they decide that it is time to confess to the police of what really happened. When Billy tells this to Gloria, she describes him as a selfish son and she slaps him across the face in disbelief and breaks down in tears. As the police interrogate Billy and Doug, the family receive word that Gene had finally died. It is then revealed that when Doug attended Gene's funeral, Gloria had forgiven him for what happened. The movie ends when Billy takes the bowling ball that was found after the fatal accident and roles it down the sidewalk as Billy looks on.\n\n\nAmerican-born screenwriter Brian Carbee wrote \"Accidents Happen\" based on his childhood in 1980s Connecticut, changing his own name to \"Billy Conway\". He had previously performed in a one person show titled \"In Search of Mike\", which director Andrew Lancaster saw and asked Carbee if he would adapt the show to a short film. Carbee subsequently wrote a novel which served as the basis for his \"Accidents Happen\" screenplay. He developed the screenplay through the prestigious Aurora Script Workshop in Sydney, where producer Anthony Anderson had worked and collaborated on his 2004 film \"Somersault\". In 2004, the completed script was nominated for an Australian Inside Film Award for Best Unproduced Screenplay, but it took a further three years to gather finances for the project. Anderson, Carbee and Lancaster successfully applied for funding from Screen Australia on two occasions; they were granted A$18,000 in May 2003 to fund drafts of the script, and $50,000 in November 2007. In September 2005, Anderson traveled to New York City with three other Australian producers to meet with investors at No Borders Co-Production Market, a division of the Independent Feature Project Market in which filmmakers attempt to secure financing for their projects. The film was the first production from the Abacus Film Fund, co-founded by producer Heather Ogilvie and corporate advisers BG Capital Corporation. British production company Bankside Films of London also assisted in raising finances and is handling all international sales of the film. The filmmakers received a 40% rebate on all production costs from Screen Australia. Davis was the only American actor to be cast, in spite of the story's American setting; the rest of the cast is Australian, with feigned American accents.\n\n\"Accidents Happen\" was originally intended to be filmed in Connecticut, where it is set, but production remained in Australia, where the script had been written, because finances were easier to raise than in the United States. Filming was slated to begin in April 2008 but was delayed until June. Lancaster said that he did \"a huge amount of technical preparation\" before filming began, so that on the set, he could focus his directing on the actors' performances, since the cast were largely inexperienced. Principal photography commenced in early June with scenes shot on a built set at Sydney's Fox Studios. Most filming took place in and around Kuringgai, first on Gillian Parade in West Pymble for a week in late June and then Lincoln St, St Ives for 1–2 July. Lincoln St residents complained about possible disruptions to Ku-ring-gai Council, starting a petition to have production moved elsewhere, and threatening to play bagpipes and wave lights around during filming if it went on as planned. The council then offered a revised filming schedule, cutting filming down by two days and bringing each day's finishing time forward by an hour to 12:30 am, and the producers offered some residents a $500 payment to cover any inconveniences. Filming of the story's integral car-crash scene was relocated to another street after the discord.\n\nSelect footage of \"Accidents Happen\" was screened to potential distributors at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival and was shown at the American Film Market in November 2008. The final cut of the film had its world premiere on 23 April 2009 at the Tribeca Film Festival and was screened in June 2009 at the Sydney Film Festival. It was shown in October 2009 at the Branchage Jersey Film Festival, the Cinéma des Antipodes festival and the Sitges Film Festival.\n\n\"Accidents Happen\" took in $157,131 at the box office in Australia.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that five of nine surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 5.5/10. Russell Edwards of \"Variety\" wrote, \"John Irving-style mishaps and labored irony fail to maintain drama or coherence in \"Accidents Happen\", an Australian-made, faux-American dysfunctional-family black comedy.\"\n\n\n"}

It features an owl (the company logo) flying its way through six worlds filled with monsters. The owl uses various waves of echo-location which the player fires at the enemies.\n\nAccording to the manual backstory, the sun-wizard master Acanthropsis discovers the \"Cosmic Power\" with a toll on his life. Before dying he teaches it to his disciples, Alestes and Mentor.\n\nBecause of memory constraints, the game features no introduction, however the game and manual mention that Alestes has been transformed into an owl, and has to pass through Mentor's traps and monsters in order to reach the Cosmic Power.\n\nThe game makes great use of many Amiga features such as scales of colors done with raster lines, halfbrite graphics mode for the between-level pictures, three layers of parallax scrolling using dual-playfield mode, in-game palette swapping and continuous flashing of the background palette to simulate additional colors. Featuring three floppies, the game ran on all Amiga computers. In common with other Amiga titles, the music was created with sampled sounds.\n\nThe game featured a theme song by Tim Wright, which – atypically for an action game – was a classically themed, piano-led instrumental. The title song was adapted without giving him proper credit by the keyboardist of Dimmu Borgir in the song \"Sorgens Kammer\" for their \"Stormblåst\" album. The band did not know about this. Following several months of communication between Wright and Dimmu Borgir, and in a nod to the composer, the band did not include the track on a later re-recording of \"Stormblåst\".\n\nThe title song is also slightly different from the version that Tim Wright originally submitted to Art & Magic. Franck Sauer advised Wright that he could source improved piano sounds for the piece, and requested permission to change them. Wright agreed, but did not hear the end result before the game went to final master, and consequently some notes within the piece were transposed; this 'mistake' was also covered by Dimmu Borgir.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5874033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5874033", "title": "Al Watan (Saudi Arabia)", "text": "Al Watan (Saudi Arabia)\n\nAl Watan (, ) is a daily newspaper in Saudi Arabia. The chairman of the newspaper is Bandar bin Khalid. \n\n\"Al Watan\"'s main publishing centre was at Abha in the south of the country, close to the Yemen border. The paper was based in the Asir province, the south-west of Saudi Arabia. However, later its headquarters was moved to Jeddah. In addition, it has publishing facilities in London, New York, Amman, and Cairo.\n\n\"Al Watan\" was launched on 1 September 2000 by Assir Establishment for Press and Publishing. \"Al Watan\" is said to be influenced by the perspectives of Khalid Al Faisal, who initiated the idea of establishing a national newspaper that reflects the pulse and lifestyle of Saudi Arabia, and seeks to engage a mass audience across all regions of the Kingdom. The publishing facilities of the paper were constructed on a site donated by late Crown Prince Sultan. \n\n\"Al Watan\" was initially established as a small regional newspaper. Then, it developed as one of the top three most read Arabic dailies in the Kingdom (ranked by IPSOS and PARC) and tied for first place based on an independent bookshop audit conducted by PARC. Its vision is to become the number one most read newspaper in the Kingdom by 2012. This growth has not only provided \"Al Watan\" with local acknowledgment through being rated among the most credible local newspapers, but International as well by being the most quoted local newspaper by International Media. \n\nIn early 2009, \"Al Watan\" presented its news identity to its readers in the Kingdom, which was a milestone for the newspaper. It also expanded its printing facilities across the Kingdom, making it the only Saudi daily that is printed every morning in four major cities within the Kingdom. The 48-pages of the new edition published in broadsheet format cover in depth Saudi affairs with a wide range of feature stories, news, analysis, lifestyle and reports. During the tenure of Jamal Khashoggi as editor-in-chief, \"Al Watan\" columnists aggressively poked at the contradictions and oppressive effects of Saudi Islam, especially with regard to women. Eventually, religious conservatives, under pressure of social change, regarded \"Al Watan\" as a major enemy.\n\nThe online edition of the paper was the 34th most visited website for 2010 in the MENA region.\n\n\"Al Watan\" is one of the most liberal newspapers in Saudi Arabia, the other one is \"Okaz\".\n\nIt is further considered to be one of the most pro-reform newspapers in the country. However, in Saudi context, the liberalism is largely based on the capacity of the shareholders and the very powerful self-censorship of the journalists. World Association of Newspapers considers \"Al Watan\" as an outspoken paper, although newspapers in Saudi Arabia express more or less similar views on critical topics.\n\n\"Al Watan\"'s editor-in-chief, Jamal Khashoggi, was very influential journalist who worked in the newspaper until May 2010. Additionally, it hosts relatively liberal columnists such as Turki Al Dakhil, Amira Kashari and Mahmoud Sabaagh. Current editor-in-chief of the paper is Talal Al Sheik who is also a member in board of directors of Saudi Journalists Association (SJA). Mahmoud Trawri, a former literary editor of \"Al Watan\", won the Sharjah Award for Arab Creativity for his first novel \"Maimouna\" in 2001. The novel is about the role of local merchant in slave trade and the racism experienced by the North African people in Saudi Arabia. However, his book was banned in the Kingdom. Saudi activist Manal Al Sharif also wrote for the daily. Another Saudi Arabian woman journalist, Samar Al Mogran, is among the former contributors of \"Al Watan\".\n\n\"Al Watan\" became a forum for reformist issues in the early 2003. Columnists initiated a discussion regarding whether the teachings of strict Muslim scholars were granted too much credence within Saudi society. They also began to challenge the authority of the mutaween, the religious police force. Late Interior Minister Prince Nayef, who effectively controlled the press in Saudi Arabia, clearly showed his distaste for the new discussions taking place. As a result of its progressive approach, religious conservatives began to call \"Al Watan\" \"Al-Wathan\", which means \"the idol\" in Arabic. The paper is regarded as the youngest and one of the highest distribution papers in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn March 2002, fifteen students at a girls' school in Mecca died due to fire. It was alleged that the feared religious police, or mutawaeen, had not attempted to rescue the students immediately, because the students inside the burning building were not wearing the requisite black body covering. In the following months, some editors were dismissed, including Qenan al Ghamdi, the brash editor-in-chief of \"Al Watan\". Al Ghamdi was fired after a report described poor living conditions for Interior Ministry soldiers deployed to Mecca for the annual Hajj pilgrimage.\n\nAfter the resignation of former editor-in-chief, Kenan Al Ghamdi, Jamal Khashoggi became editor-in-chief of \"Al Watan\". However, his term lasted for less than two months in 2003. More specifically, his term lasted only for 54 days. May 2003 attacks in Saudi Arabia led to the liberals' attack against Wahhabi ideas that financially support salafism. Such criticisms were openly expressed through articles published in \"Al Watan\". Specifically, after a week of intense debate following the bombings of three Riyadh housing complexes in May 2003, an \"Al Watan\" journalist asked the minister of interior, Nayef, if the attacks meant that the mutaween would be restructured. Prince Nayef replied, “As a Saudi, you should be ashamed to be asking this question.” One week later, the government fired the editor-in-chief of the paper, Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nJamal Khashoggi began to work as editor-in-chief again in \"Al Watan\" in 2007 after being an advisor to Turki Al Faisal during his post as Saudi Ambassador to the U.S.. However, Khashoggi resigned from his post for a second time in May 2010. \"Al Watan\" announced that Khashoggi resigned \"to focus on his personal projects\". This statement was published on the website of the paper and in its Sunday edition. His resignation came three days after a column by poet Ibrahim al Almaee criticising Salafism was published. The column by al Almaee challenged the Salafists' rejection of popular religious traditions such as patronising shrines and graves of important Islamic figures. It is speculated that his resignation was related to official displeasure with articles critical of the state's harsh Islamic rules. After Khashoggi's resignation, Bandar bin Khalid al Faisal, the chairman of the newspaper, published a statement and praised him as \"a loyal son... who left a clear mark on its (\"Al Watan\"'s) progress.\"\n\nIn March 2002, the Libyan government sued \"Al Watan\" due to its criticisms over the positions of Libya and its then leader, Muammar Gaddafi, leading to deterioration of the strong ties between Libya and Saudi Arabia.\n\nFaisal bin Abdullah, president of the Saudi Red Crescent Society, filed a lawsuit due to perceived defamation against one of \"Al Watan\" journalists, Saleh al Shehy, in June 2007. The other controversy experienced by the paper was about Kenan bin Abdallah al Ghamidi. On 30 November 2007, the Ministry of Information and Culture asked him to stop writing for \"Al Watan\" without giving any explanation. This incident is seen as a clear example of censorship in Saudi Arabia by Reporters without Borders.\n\nIn February 2013, a criminal complaint was filled against \"Al Watan\" due to its publishing of a caricature criticizing Maronite Patriarch Bechara Al Rahi's visit to Syria.\n\n\"Al Watan\" provides extensive but uncritical coverage of local news in addition to the usual positive reporting on the activities of the ruling family and the government. \n\nAn extraordinary article was published by Bandar bin Sultan, then-Saudi ambassador to Washington, in \"Al Watan\", on 1 June 2004. Prince Bandar regarded the efforts of the Saudi security forces against terrorism as ‘feeble’, and declared that terrorism \"has nothing to do with America or Israel or the Christians or Jews . . . So let us stop these meaningless justifications for what those criminals are doing and let [us] stop blaming others while the problem comes from within us’. He also pointed out that the Kingdom’s religious scholars ‘have to declare jihad against those deviants and to fully support it, as those who keep silent about the truth are mute devils\". He further argued that religious fighters operating inside the kingdom should be “vanquished” the way “King Abdul Aziz did at the Battle of Al Sabla [in 1929].”\n\nMajed Garoub, the head of the Jeddah lawyers’ committee, in three articles published in \"Al Watan\" in the period of May–June 2010, called for the adoption of certain measures against domestic violence. \n\nOn 8 June 2010, \"Al Watan\" published a story about the religious police entering a woman’s flat after midnight in the Fahd neighbourhood of Najran without apparent cause two days earlier. Nearly two weeks later, on 21 June 2010, the commission issued an apology, again published in \"Al Watan\", stating “we express our apology about the unintentional inconvenience and injury this matter has caused, and we apologize to all regarding what our brothers, the members of the commission, have rushed into.”\n\nIn August 2013, an editorial of the paper stated that a foreign military strike against Syria due to civil war in the country was inevitable whatever its form would be.\n\n\"Al Watan\" is a partner of Saudi Falcons, a Saudi motosport team of which one of its members is Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Faisal.\n\nList of newspapers in Saudi Arabia\n"}
{"id": "829663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=829663", "title": "Alice (1988 film)", "text": "Alice (1988 film)\n\nAlice is a 1988 dark fantasy film written and directed by Jan Švankmajer. Its original Czech title is Něco z Alenky, which means \"Something from Alice\". It is a loose adaptation of Lewis Carroll's first Alice book, \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (1865), about a girl who follows a white rabbit into a bizarre fantasy land. Alice is played by Kristýna Kohoutová. The film combines live action with stop motion animation, and is distinguished by its dark and uncompromising production design.\n\nFor Švankmajer, a prolific director of short films for more than two decades, \"Alice\" became his first venture into feature-length filmmaking. The director had been disappointed by other adaptations of Carroll's book, which interpret it as a fairy tale. His aim was instead to make the story play out like an amoral dream. The film won the feature film award at the 1989 Annecy International Animated Film Festival.\n\nAlice (Kristýna Kohoutová) is in her sitting room when a mysterious creaking noise draws her attention to a taxidermically stuffed White Rabbit in a glass case upon a desk. The Rabbit escapes the box, dresses itself, and steals a pair of scissors from a hidden drawer. Alice chases the Rabbit out of the house and up a hill, upon which is a desk identical to the one from her sitting room. The Rabbit crawls inside the desk drawer, which closes behind him. Alice opens the drawer to find nothing but another pair of scissors. Alice manages to crawl into the drawer, where she finds herself heading downstairs in an elevator whose windows display strange household objects on shelves as it goes down. When the elevator doors open, Alice is just in time to see the Rabbit go through a tiny door and disappear. She tries to follow, but is too large to fit.\n\nAlice finds a cookie and eats it, transforming into a small china doll identical to herself. Now she is the correct size to fit through the door but finds it locked. She then finds a bottle of ink labeled \"Drink Me.\" Following directions, she grows enormous, filling the small room. Frustrated, the enlarged Alice cries until the room floods with her tears. Numerous small creatures begin swimming around her head, including a mouse in a rowboat. It docks its boat on her head and tries to prepare a cooking fire in her hair. Alice submerges and the mouse swims away. Soon after, she is able to go through the door by shrinking again with another cookie.\n\nAgain a china doll, she finds herself at the banks of a brook in the countryside and encounters the White Rabbit, who mistakes her for \"Mary\", his maid, and commands her to fetch him his scissors from his rabbit-cage-like house. While searching for the scissors, she drinks from another ink bottle and immediately returns to her true size, but finds herself trapped inside the now too-small house, much to the Rabbit and other animals' horror. They try to force her out by launching a skull-head lizard through the window. Alice kicks him away, causing him to burst and spill his sawdust innards. The angry animals finally imprison the girl by submerging her in a pot of milk, trapping her in a white Alice-shaped shell, which they lock inside a storage room filled with specimen jars.\n\nAlice manages to break out of the Alice shell. Inside a sardine can, she discovers a key and escapes the storage room, stepping into a long hall with many doors. In one of them, she meets a sock-like Caterpillar in between a room swarming with sock-like worms. In the hallway once more, she follows the sound of a crying baby, which turned out to be a live piglet inside a dollhouse stormed with breaking plates and pots. In another room, a tea party mechanically proceeding without end, hosted by a taxidermic Hare, a wooden-puppet Hatter and a taxadermic ferret. The Hatter produces the White Rabbit from inside its hat. The rabbit flees upstairs and Alice follows him.\n\nBehind a bedsheet curtain in the attic, Alice discovers a garden of paper flowers clipped from old magazines. A troop of playing cards march into the garden, followed by the King and Queen of Hearts. Two of the Jacks fall out of formation and begin to quarrel. The Queen commands the White Rabbit, her executioner, to decapitate the Jacks; he does so with his scissors. A card-playing Hatter and Hare are also sentenced to death, only to exchange their heads and keep playing. \n\nThe White Rabbit delivers a trial summons to a puzzled Alice. She presents herself into a courtroom where she finds herself on trial for eating the Queen's tarts. Alice points out that the tarts are sitting untouched in the courtroom, but the Queen insists that she stop being so quarrelsome so that they may get to the execution. Annoyed, Alice eats the tarts, which causes her head to shapeshift into that of other characters. The frustrated Queen demands that \"all\" her heads be cut off, and the Rabbit advances toward her with his scissors.\n\nAbruptly, Alice wakes up in the sitting room where she began to tell the story. All around the room are the various household objects that populated her dream: socks (the Caterpillar) in a sewing basket, playing cards scattered on a table. The glass case that formerly contained the taxadermic rabbit is now shattered and empty. Going to a desk identical to the one that began her adventures, she opens its drawer, takes out a pair of scissors, and narrates to herself, \"He's late, as usual. I think I'll cut \"his\" head off.\"\n\nIn Alice's English version:\n\nJan Švankmajer, who had been making short films since the mid-1960s, says he got the confidence to make a feature-length film due to finishing the shorts \"Jabberwocky\" and \"Down to the Cellar\". He described Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", a work which had followed him since he was a child, as \"one of the most important and amazing books produced by this civilisation.\" He argued that other film adaptations of the story had interpreted it as a fairy tale, but that Carroll had written it like a dream, and that was what he wanted to transmit: \"While a fairy tale has got an educational aspect – it works with the moral of the lifted forefinger (good overcomes evil), dream, as an expression of our unconscious, uncompromisingly pursues the realisation of our most secret wishes without considering rational and moral inhibitions, because it is driven by the principle of pleasure. My \"Alice\" is a realised dream.\" Despite the film's heavy usage of stop motion, and unlike most other traditional stop motion films, the movie does not utilize any miniature sets to portray its special effects.\n\nThe film first premiered in the United States, where it was released on 3 August 1988. It played at the 1989 Annecy International Animated Film Festival where it received the prize for best feature film. In Czechoslovakia it premiered on 1 November 1990. The English dubbed version features the voice of Camilla Power.\n\nIn \"The New York Times\", Caryn James wrote that although Švankmajer \"strips away all sweetness and light, he does not violate Lewis Carroll's story\", and called \"Alice\" an \"extraordinary film [which] explores the story's dark undercurrents\". James described the animation as \"remarkably fluid\" and held forward the dynamics of the film, which contrasts visually captivating elements with superficiality: \"Mr. Švankmajer never lets us forget we are watching a film in which an actress plays Alice telling a story\", although, \"with its extreme close-ups, its constant motion and its smooth animation, the film is so visually active that it distracts us from a heavy-handed fact - this is a world of symbols come alive.\" Upon the British home-media release in 2011, Philip Horne reviewed the film for \"The Daily Telegraph\". Horne called it \"an astonishing film\", and wrote: \"This is no cleaned up version approved by preview audiences or committees of studio executives – my youthful fellow-spectator declared quite aptly at one point, 'She's rather a violent young girl, isn't she?' – but its glorious proliferation of magical transformations works like a charm on anyone who values the imagination.\" The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes has \"Alice\" with a \"Fresh\" rating of 100% based on 18 reviews.\n\nThe film with original Czech audio and English subtitles was unavailable on home video until 2011 when the British Film Institute released the film on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\n"}

This does not include deductions in the form of special tax concessions or rebates, but refers to up front financial investment from any local, state or commonwealth government authority, or the state and federal film funding bodies, such as Screen Australia, The New South Wales Film and Television Office, Screen Queensland, ScreenWest, The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and The South Australian Film Corporation.\n\nAustralian Independent Films do not include films that would be classed as Studio Films, yet Australia does not have a studio system as such. In Australia the central and most powerful film bureaucracy is the government and the industry is dominated by government-funded films.\n\nAustralia was a prolific independent filmmaking nation through the early days of cinema. During the period from 1910-1912 some 33 feature films were produced. Following the success of The Story of the Kelly Gang in 1906, there was a mini boom in 'bushranger films'. This ended in 1912 when the government banned production of all bushranger films due to a perceived civil unrest they were causing. This marks the period where the government become active in film production, by funding and commissioning films. Since then Australian Government Films have come to dominate the Australian film landscape.\n\nThere have been some very successful Independent Australian Films, arguably more successful than the Australian Government Films.

It was developed and published by Ubi Soft in conjunction with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and DC Comics. It is based on the television series \"The New Batman Adventures\" and is a sequel to the game \"\".\n\nAs Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Nightwing, the player has to fight groups of enemies. The story mode, which forms the bulk of the game, can be played either alone or co-operatively, and rewards players for completing levels not only by continuing the story, but also with an upgrades system. This allows players to purchase new moves for their character and other game bonuses. There is also a challenge mode in which players (either cooperatively or competitively) take on groups of thugs without a storyline.\n\nThe game is played under a time limit, and features co-operative play. It also has 4 different difficulty levels: 'Easy', 'Medium', 'Hard', and 'Dark Knight'.\n\nKevin Conroy - Batman/Bruce Wayne\n\nScott Menville - Robin/Tim Drake\n\nLoren Lester - Nightwing/Dick Grayson\n\nTara Strong - Batgirl/Barbara Gordon\n\nCary-Hiroyuki Tagawa - Sin Tzu\n\nJeffrey Combs - Scarecrow\n\nHector Elizondo - Bane\n\nRon Perlman - Clayface\n\nAdditional Character Voices By:\n\nKevin Michael Richardson\n\nPhilip Maurice Hayes\n\nChad Einbinder\n\nKimberly Brooks\n\nJohn Cho\n\nTim Dang\n\nWill Friedle\n\nOn the anniversary of the murders of his parents Thomas and Martha Wayne, Batman takes a visit to Crime Alley to pay his respects to them. Just as he finishes saving civilians and defeating their captors, both Arkham Asylum and Stonegate Prison experience a massive prison breakout. Commissioner James Gordon contacts Batman, but is overwhelmed by the Scarecrow's nerve gas. Rushing over to the courthouse, Batman sees Gordon affected by the toxin and Scarecrow appears. He taunts the hero, claiming that Batman will soon give in to fear. Despite being at a disadvantage due to the nerve gas, Batman overcomes and defeats Scarecrow. Gordon recovers and agrees to keep watch on Scarecrow whilst Batman leaves.\n\nGordon notifies Batman of Clayface having taken over the Gotham Chemical Factory. Defusing the bombs that were placed on the rooftops of Gotham, Batman makes contact with Clayface, who reveals his plan to turn everyone in the city into beings like himself. Batman arrives at the chemical factory, and Gordon informs him of a weapon of mass destruction that is planning to arrive at any minute. Batman confronts Clayface, as the villain merges with a few of the infected to become a larger version of himself. Batman weakens Clayface via electricity, neutralizing him in the process.\n\nDuring a talk with Gordon, Batman deduces that the culprit has to be Sin Tzu, a renowned warlord from Asia that was captured and sent to Arkham Asylum for further study. Sin Tzu intercepts the transmission and declares Gotham will become a new stronghold for his empire once Batman is defeated. Gordon tells Batman to head to the harbor to disarm the doomsday weapon. Arriving at the harbor, Batman hijacks the cargo ship carrying the weapon and takes it to the Batcave, just as Sin Tzu predicted. Batman finds the doomsday weapon, but is ambushed by Sin Tzu's men. Just as Batman thwarts their attempts to open the doors to Wayne Manor, he attempts to disarm the weapon, only to have Bane surprise him. Batman soundly defeats Bane.\n\nBatman discovers Sin Tzu is hiding in Arkham Asylum, and he has Gordon and the GCPD surround Arkham so Sin Tzu won't escape. Batman enters the sewer system. Gordon reveals a method Sin Tzu used to mentally control Scarecrow, Clayface, and Bane, and he warns Batman he may be suspectible to Sin Tzu's power as well. Now in the main Arkham facility, Batman sees that the Joker, Harley Quinn, Mr. Freeze, and Poison Ivy have been placed in suspended animation as he goes into the lower levels of Arkham. Finding Sin Tzu in a chamber, Batman and the former engage in a lengthy fight. Sin Tzu is defeated once and for all.\n\nAs dawn approaches, Gordon reveals he couldn't tell Batman about the imprisonment of Sin Tzu at Arkham for national security reasons. The hero reminisces on the vows that have to be honored to the living and the dead (reminding himself of his parents' murder having a profound effect on his life), and the game ends with Batman looking over Gotham City.\n\nOne of the main draws to the game was that it introduced a new character into the Batman universe, as \"\" did with Harley Quinn. This new character, Sin Tzu, was created by comic artist Jim Lee. However, Sin Tzu did not gain popularity as a character and was never to be seen again in any media, with the exception of the game's novelization. The game shipped in regular versions with just the game, and boxed special editions that came with action figures for the Xbox and PS2 versions, and a lithograph with the GameCube version.\n\n\"Rise of Sin Tzu\" was given a score of 59.44% for the PS2 version, 61.62% for the Xbox version, 58.80% for the Game Boy Advance version, and 61.68% for the GameCube version on GameRankings. On Metacritic, it has a score of 67 out of 100 for the Xbox version, and 63 out of 100 for the other console versions.\n\n\"Game Informer\" gave the game a score of 5 out of 10 for PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube, while the same magazine gave the Game Boy Advance port a better score of 7 out of 10.\n\nA novel based on the game with the same name was released around the same time of the games release date. The novel, written by Devin Grayson and Flint Dille (who wrote the game's script) was told in the first person, with Clayface, the Scarecrow, a Stonegate inmate named Freddie Galan, Bane, a Hispanic thug named Ramon Domingo, Sin Tzu, Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Nightwing, and Alfred each providing the narrative at different points.\n\n\"Batman: Shadow of Sin Tzu\" was a year-long webcomic released bi-weekly on the DC Comics website, serving as a sequel to events depicted in \"Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu\".\n"}
{"id": "3126114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3126114", "title": "Battle Arena Toshinden 2", "text": "Battle Arena Toshinden 2\n\nBattle Arena Toshinden 2 is a weapon based, 3D fighting game developed by Tamsoft. It was released for the arcades in 1995 by Capcom, followed by ports to the PlayStation and PC. It is the sequel to \"Battle Arena Toshinden\", and was a departure in that it was developed for the arcades first, whereas the original had been console exclusive.\n\nBattle Arena Toshinden URA (full title \"Ultimate Revenge Attack\") is a Sega Saturn specific sequel to \"Toshinden Remix\" (aka \"Toshinden S\").\n\nThe core gameplay remains unchanged from the original \"Battle Arena Toshinden\", but the game does include a simple combo system. The 3D movement was also altered to create slightly better balance in battle; differentiating from the first game, dodge rolling will no longer make the character temporarily immune to the opponent's attack (in the first game, it was possible for a character to dodge straight through even the most deadly attacks). As in the first game, a player falling out of the ring will result in a ring out, only this time, if both players fall out of the ring at the same time, the one who falls out last will be declared the winner.\n\nFollowing the discovery of his treachery, Gaia has been branded a traitor and marked for death by Uranus and Master, the leaders of the Secret Society, who hold another Battle Arena Toshinden tournament in order to lure him out so that he can be swiftly eliminated by them and their loyal forces. In a complete state of personal desperation, Gaia turns to the previous tournament's fighters for help in having to overthrow his former allies, unaware that the entire situation is a deadly trap/scheme orchestrated by Uranus as she personally seeks to eliminate all who stands in her ambitious way of overthrowing Master and taking the Secret Society for herself.\n\nAs in the previous tournament, Eiji Shinjo advances to the finals and manages to defeat both Uranus and Master in battle, and even though he is still unable to locate his long-lost older brother Sho, a series of clues are left behind that may lead Eiji to Sho from within the near future. With the deaths of both Uranus and Master, it seems that the Secret Society has been crushed once and for all. However, unbeknownst to the participants, the tournament has secretly been observed through the eyes of the mysterious Vermilion, an agent for the Secret Society's long-time rival criminal group, the Organization, who start to put their own plan for the fighters in motion.\n\nSometime after the events of the first Toshinden game, a police scientist named Ronron creates an android fighter intended for law enforcement, its name being the Replicant. To make the android as strong as possible, its fighting abilities are patterned off the world’s greatest fighter, Sho Shinjo. However, the prototype is stolen just before it can be fully completed. Within time, someone begins murdering famous fighters around the world in a surprising yet shocking manner. With no evidence as to who is behind these murders, the Toshinden fighters grow suspicious of each other. Meanwhile, a mysterious man, known only as Ripper, is seeking Sho Shinjo as his sister (believed to have been Cupido) has disappeared without a trace and Ripper himself believes that Sho may have killed her from within the past. However, every lead Ripper finds takes him to the scene of one of these mysterious murders, leading to him becoming the prime suspect in a shrouded conspiracy that seems to be surrounding him and the rest of the Toshinden fighters.\n\nThough based on the original version of \"Battle Arena Toshinden 2\", \"Battle Arena Toshinden URA\" has altered gameplay, making it feel notably different. It also has all new arenas, a new story, a different CG intro, new rendered cinemas, and four exclusive new characters (Ripper, Ronron, Replicant and Wolf) that replace four of the original version's characters (Gaia, Chaos, Uranus and Master). Though within the game \"URA\" is an abbreviation, the word \"Ura\" also has combat connotations in Japanese.\n\nA special edition of \"Toshinden 2\", named \"Battle Arena Toshinden 2 Plus\" was later released only in Japan for the PlayStation on The Best range (equivalent to the Greatest Hits and Platinum ranges in North America and Europe). It features enhanced graphics, improved control and tweaked CPU AI. It also makes some balancing tweaks to the characters' attacks. An option to save results, option settings and unlocked characters to a memory card was also added.\n\n\"Toshinden 2\" was ported to the PC. It is a Windows port of the PlayStation version with arcade graphical fidelity, the ability to play the game in higher resolutions and some additional options, such as the ability to remap all the controls (the PlayStation version only allows the remapping of the shoulder buttons). Unlike the original PlayStation port, it also saves unlocked characters, settings and results. However, the introductory movie was removed.\n\nIn reviews for \"Battle Arena Toshinden 2\", critics generally commented that the game is good but shows little improvement over its predecessor and fails to measure up to marketplace competitors like \"Virtua Fighter 2\" and \"Tekken 2\". The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" had a more positive reaction than most, praising the graphics and the new character Vermillion, though they did remark that the game was not as good as \"Virtua Fighter 2\". A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" similarly said that though \"Battle Arena Toshinden 2\" addresses many of the complaints made about the original game and has impressive light-sourcing effects, backgrounds, and overdrive super moves, it still fails to measure up to \"Virtua Fighter 2\": \"The depth of gameplay and complexity of the strategy isn't there, and the speed and smoothness of \"VF2\" far outweighs \"Toshinden 2\"s light-sourcing and moving backgrounds. ... The initial 'wow' of the first \"Toshinden\" ... is gone and what's left is a fighting game that isn't deep, fast, or balanced enough to compete with the best.\" The magazine's later review of the arcade version was still less enthusiastic. The reviewer contended that the \"Toshinden\" series is not well-suited to the arcade environment, and criticized the fact that the arcade version is near-identical to the PlayStation version, since standards are higher in arcades.\n\n\"Maximum\"'s Rich Leadbetter argued that the changes from the original game, particularly the new characters Chaos and Vermillion, made the game better, but also felt that they were insufficient, particularly in light of the graphical advances PlayStation games had made since the original Toshinden was released. He concluded by advising PlayStation owners to wait for \"Tekken 2\" instead. Major Mike of \"GamePro\" similarly described the game as \"more of the same.\" While he stated the graphics are better than the first game, he derided the game's lack of intelligent fighting technique, particularly that combos are very limited and the fights essentially boil down to trading special attacks. IGN stated that the game's animations were not very smooth and the camera made gameplay challenging. Final comments on the game stated that although the game wasn't necessarily bad, it wasn't exactly outstanding either.\n\n\"Battle Arena Toshinden URA\", however, met with overwhelmingly negative reviews. Critics remarked that despite the game running in high resolution, the enhanced textures over the PlayStation game cause \"URA\" to suffer from a generally muddy and choppy appearance. Several reviewers called the new character Ronron one of the worst fighting game characters ever created. Many critics also began to find serious problems in the basic Toshinden gameplay with this installment; Jeff Gerstmann stated in \"GameSpot\" that \"Though URA has the most features of any Toshinden release to date, it's still like playing the previous Toshinden games. That is to say, the control is sluggish, the combo system is weak, and the special moves are dull.\" Dan Hsu similarly wrote in \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", \"I look at these games as a novelty now, because it's more flash than technique. The fighters do not have a lot of moves available, and the ones they do have are pretty boring.\" A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" commented, \"Any time you can beat the entire game on the hardest difficulty by mashing on one button - with your eyes closed - there's something very wrong.\" \"GamePro\"s Major Mike found it very similar to the previous Saturn entry in the series, \"Battle Arena Toshinden Remix\", and concluded, \"Simply put, URA is just more of a bad thing.\" He gave it a 3.0 out of 5 or lower in every category, including a 0.5 for funfactor. Lee Nutter noted in \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" that the game had been given an unusually high level of PAL optimization, but concluded that the mediocre graphics and lack of depth in the gameplay made it a poor buy, particularly with \"Fighters Megamix\" soon to be released in PAL regions.\n\n"}

The building was in the Old Central Square and after the liberal revolution of 1871 it was called National Theater. Towards the end of general Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián government, the building was remodeled to celebrate the Discovery of America fourth centennial anniversary. Finally, the theatre was destroyed by the earthquakes of 1917–18 and demolished in 1923.\n\nAn enthusiastic fan of Opera, and following his mistress -Josefa Silva's advice-, president for life of Guatemala Rafael Carrera started the construction of a massive National Theater that was called \"Carrera Theater\" in his honor, and was located in the old Central Square. The Old Central Square was located to the northeast side of Guatemala City -then not larger than a tiny village- and in 1776 was used to place the first block of the new Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción after the 1773 earthquakes destroy Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala. The place had been chosen as the new city Central Square, saving the surroundings for the new Cathedral, Palace and houses for the richest families of the time, the Aycinena family, given that the family leader, Fermín de Aycinena, had contributed considerably to the move of the city from its old place. However, the design approved by the Spanish crown had the Central Square in a different location, and this one became the Old Central Square.\n\nYears later it became a commercial site and on 6 August 1832, then State of Guatemala Governor, Dr. Mariano Galvez, issued a decree to build a theater in the Old Central Square site. However, political climate was very tense in the country and when the civil war between liberal and conservative parties escalated, Galvez was overthrown and the theater could not be built.\n\nThe project was revisited in 1852, when Juan Matheu and Manuel Francisco Pavón Aycinena present Rafael Carrera with a new plan. Once approved, Carrera commissioned Matheu himself and Miguel Ruiz de Santisteban to build the theater. Initially it was in charge of engineer Miguel Rivera Maestre, but he quit after a few months and was replaced by German expert José Beckers, who built the Greek façades and added a lobby. This was the first monumental building ever built in the Republican era of Guatemala, given that in the 1850s the country finally was enjoying some peace and prosperity.\n\nAppleton's Guide to México and Guatemala of 1884 describes the theater as follows: «In the middle of the square is the Theater, similar in size and elegance to any of the rest of Spanish America. Lines of orange trees and other nice trees of brilliant flowers and delicious fragances surround the bilduing while the statues and fountains placed at certain intervals enhance even more the beauty of the place.\n\nAfter the Liberal reform from 1871, the theater was called National Theater. In 1892, it was refurbished, removing the conservative Coat of Arms from its façade and substituting it with a sculpture and inscriptions. The orange trees, fountains and sculptures were removed, and in their place modern gardens were planted and a bust of José Batres Montúfar was erected.\n\nDuring the government of general Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián, the theater was remodeled to celebrate the Discovery of America fourth centennial anniversary; the Italian community in Guatemala donated a statue of Christopher Columbus -Cristóbal Colón, in Spanish- which was placed next to the theater. Since then, the place was called \"Colón Theater\".\n\nThe Colón Theater was destroyed by the 1917–18 earthquakes and remained in ruins until 1923; it was not demolished, due to the government of Manuel Estrada Cabrera incompetence to deal with the disaster, and then because of the Revolution of 1920 to depose Estrada Cabrera. Later on, the instability of the country lead to a coup de etat by general José María Orellana in 1921, who overthrew then president Carlos Herrera. In place of the theater a street market was built.\n\n"}
{"id": "205061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205061", "title": "Censored Eleven", "text": "Censored Eleven\n\nThe Censored Eleven is a group of \"Looney Tunes\" and \"Merrie Melodies\" cartoons originally produced and released by Warner Bros. that were withheld from syndication by United Artists (UA) in 1968. UA owned the distribution rights to the Associated Artists Productions library at that time, and decided to pull these eleven cartoons from broadcast because the use of ethnic stereotypes in the cartoons, specifically black stereotypes, was deemed too offensive for contemporary audiences. The ban has been continued by UA and the successive owners of the pre-August 1948 \"Looney Tunes\"/\"Merrie Melodies\". These shorts have not been officially broadcast on television since 1968 and have only been exhibited once theatrically by Warner Bros. in Spring 2010 (see below for more details) since their withdrawal. They have turned up, however, on low-cost VHS and DVD collections over the last thirty years.\n\nMany cartoons from previous decades are routinely edited on international television (and on some video and DVD collections) today. Usually, the only censorship deemed necessary is the cutting of the occasional racist joke, instance of graphic violence, or scene of a character doing something that parents and watchdog groups fear children will try to imitate, such as smoking, drinking alcohol, or self-harming activities such as depictions of suicide.\n\nOne classic cartoon gag, most prominent in MGM's \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons, is the transformation of characters into a blackface caricature after an explosion or an automobile backfire. A sequence in the \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoon \"Mouse Cleaning\" (1948) turned Tom into a blackface caricature. Upon questioning by Mammy Two Shoes, Tom answers \"No, ma'am. I ain't seen no cat aroun' here… uh unh, ain't no cat, no place, no how-no ma'am,\" in stereotypical African-American dialect. Such small amounts of supposedly objectionable material only require relatively minor cuts in the cartoon to make it palatable to censors, in spite of objections and occasional boycotts by fans.\n\nHowever, in the case of the Censored Eleven, racial themes are so essential and so completely pervade the cartoons that the copyright holders believe that no amount of selective editing could ever make them acceptable for distribution.\n\nTwo of the Censored Eleven directed by Bob Clampett have been defended by some film historians: \"Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs\" and \"Tin Pan Alley Cats\". The former is a jazz-based parody of Walt Disney's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", while the latter is a hot jazz re-interpretation of Clampett's now-classic 1938 short \"Porky in Wackyland\". Author Michelle Klein-Hass wrote the following:\nBob Clampett himself explained the evolution of \"Coal Black\" during his public appearances in the 70s and 80s, and during taped interviews:\nThe cartoon output of Warner Bros. during its heyday even sometimes had censorship problems more complex in some respects than those of features. Unlike feature films, which were routinely censored in the script, the animated shorts were passed upon only when completed, which made the producers exceptionally cautious as to restrictions. In 1983, director Chuck Jones commented on the television censorship of the Warner Bros. cartoons: \"I don't like to see the films cut at all. […] They make some cuts that are so arbitrary and stupid, you can't believe it.\" Independent stations that once ran the syndicated Warner Bros. cartoons never had the same type of censorship as first-run networks such as ABC and CBS did for the cartoons. Some stations even owned syndication rights to \"a few they consider[ed] racially stereotypical,\" but never ran them.\n\nWhen Ted Turner obtained the rights to the pre-1950 Warner Bros. library from MGM/UA in 1986, he vowed that he would not distribute or air any cartoons from the Censored Eleven. They were the only cartoons in this package not to be featured in the laserdisc series \"The Golden Age of Looney Tunes\".\n\nSince Time Warner bought Turner Broadcasting System on October 10, 1996, this policy has largely been upheld, but has also shown signs of weakening. A total of twelve Bugs Bunny shorts were not aired on Cartoon Network during its \"June Bugs\" marathon in 2001. However, Warner Bros. began to release DVD collections of classic cartoons in 2003 entitled the \"Looney Tunes Golden Collection\" with one of the cartoons (\"Frigid Hare\", which depicts a stereotypical Eskimo trying to kill a baby penguin, and was still seen on Cartoon Network as late as 2002 and featured as a DVD extra in \"March of the Penguins\") featured on the set uncut and uncensored. Also in 2001, Cartoon Network animation documentary show \"ToonHeads\" had a one-hour special centered on World War II-era cartoons and two World War II-era Bugs Bunny shorts \"Herr Meets Hare\" shown in full and \"Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips\" shown in clips in a short montage about the depictions of Japanese people at the time they were shown.\n\nWhile none of the shorts included on the discs are part of the Censored Eleven, many of the cartoons that were included were routinely censored on television, but were included uncut on DVD. Furthermore, each DVD from the \"\" opens with a foreword by Whoopi Goldberg, where she warns the audience about some of these shorts, stating that although the behavior was and is not acceptable, the cartoons depicting this are a vital part of history and should not be forgotten. The \"\" collection includes a similar disclaimer, written on a gold card and merely summarized the point that while the cartoons are considered offensive today for what they depict, they are not going to be shown censored because editing out the racist depictions—and therefore effectively denying that the racism of the era ever happened—is worse than actually showing them.\n\nMany of the Censored Eleven are available on bootleg video. \"Hittin' the Trail for Hallelujah Land\", \"Jungle Jitters\" and \"All This and Rabbit Stew\" are now in the public domain and frequently appear on home video releases and internet video searches.\n\nThe cartoons in the Censored Eleven are:\n\nFriz Freleng directed the largest number of cartoons on the list with four, followed by Tex Avery with three, and Bob Clampett with only two cartoons to make the list. Rudolf Ising, like Chuck Jones, only has one cartoon on the list. \"Angel Puss\" is the only cartoon directed by Chuck Jones on the list as well as the only cartoon in the \"Looney Tunes\" series. The rest are \"Merrie Melodies\". \"Hittin' the Trail to Hallelujah Land\" is the only black-and-white short on the list while the other 10 are in color, and the only \"Piggy\" on the list. Also, \"Goldilocks and the Jivin' Bears\" is the only cartoon on this list not to be produced by Leon Schlesinger. It is also the first to be produced by an uncredited Eddie Selzer. \"All This and Rabbit Stew\" is the only Bugs Bunny cartoon on the list.\n\"The Isle of Pingo Pongo\" is also the only Egghead (Elmer Fudd) cartoon on the list. The other 8 are one shot cartoons.\n\nSeveral more cartoons have been removed from circulation since this list was created (but are not added onto the Censored Eleven list, though most of the cartoons censored do contain extensive blackface gags and/or black stereotypes), such as Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising's \"Looney Tunes\" featuring blackface caricature Bosko, and the Inki series of cartoons by Chuck Jones, as well as numerous World War II-era cartoons concerning the Japanese such as \"Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips\" and \"Tokio Jokio\". The \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoon \"The Yankee Doodle Mouse\" (1943) has Tom in blackface.\n\nSome cartoons that remain in release have been heavily edited to remove stereotypical depictions of blacks. The \"Gone With the Wind\" satire, \"Confederate Honey\", is one. \"Fresh Hare\" is often shorn of a scene in which a blackface Bugs and Elmer sing \"Camptown Races\". Friz Freleng's 1937 cartoon \"September in the Rain\" features some black characters, but is not entirely focused on them, so has occasionally reappeared without them. An early Porky Pig Cartoon with stereotypical depictions of Blacks is \"Porky's Railroad\" (1937).\n\nTwo cartoons directed by Tex Avery during his stint at MGM are often included in cartoon compilations that list the Censored Eleven: \"Uncle Tom's Cabana\" and \"Half-Pint Pygmy\". Often included are the \"Popeye\" cartoons \"Pop-Pie a La Mode\" and \"Popeye's Pappy\" and also various WWII-era \"Popeye\" cartoons concerning the Japanese Empire such as \"You're a Sap, Mr. Jap\", \"Scrap The Japs\" and \"Seein' Red, White n' Blue\" even though they are not Warner Bros. cartoons, but were part of the pre-May 1986 MGM and a.a.p. library that wound up under Time Warner control in 1996.\n\nA number of shorts are rarely shown owing to stereotyping and potentially offensive characterizations of Native Americans. They include \"Slightly Daffy\" (1944), \"Nothing But the Tooth\" (1948), \"Tom Tom Tomcat\" (1953), \"Horse Hare\" (1960), \"A Feather in His Hare\" (1948), \"Hocus Pocus Powwow\" (1968), and \"Injun Trouble\" (1969).\n\nAs the 20th century came to a close, the Censored Eleven cartoons became more known to the public as several animation historians popularized their existence. The publicity these films received from various animation discussion websites eventually led to an article in \"The New York Times\".\n\nIn February 2010, as part of a press release for the first annual TCM Classic Film Festival, it was announced that the Censored Eleven were to receive a special screening sourced from restored 35mm film prints. This special presentation was put together by George Feltenstein, vice president of Warner Bros. classic film catalog. Film historian Donald Bogle, who has six books published to his credit on the subject of African American stereotypes in film, agreed to host the event for the festival. On April 24, 2010 a total of eight of the Censored Eleven were screened at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. The three that were not shown at the event were \"Jungle Jitters\", \"All This and Rabbit Stew\" and \"Angel Puss\". According to animation historian Jerry Beck, this event was a way for Warner Bros. to test the waters for a possible DVD release of these controversial films possibly through the \"Warner Archives\" collection.\n\nAt the New York Comic Con in October 2010, Warner Bros. confirmed that it would be releasing the Censored Eleven, completely uncut, on DVD through the Warner Archives program sometime in 2011. On December 1, 2010, animation expert Jerry Beck announced on the Shokus Internet Radio call-in talk program \"Stu's Show\" that there were plans for a general traditional retail release and not via the Warner Archives. It would be a high-class release featuring all of the Censored Eleven and other rare cartoons restored plus some bonus materials. However, no further news of a DVD release has surfaced since.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38508178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38508178", "title": "Champagne Galop", "text": "Champagne Galop\n\nThe Champagne Galop () is a piece of orchestral music by the Danish composer Hans Christian Lumbye (1810–1874) which was written to celebrate the second anniversary of Copenhagen's Tivoli in 1845. Together with Lumbye's \"Telegraph Galop\" and \"Copenhagen Steam Railway Galop\", it was included in the 2006 Danish Culture Canon as a masterpiece of Danish classical music.\n\nThe \"Champagne Galop\" was composed for the second anniversary of Copenhagen's Tivoli Gardens on 15 August 1845. As a result of torrential rain, Lumbye — who was also Tivoli's resident conductor — was only able to present it the following week on 22 August.\n\nLumbye's grandson, the conductor Tippe Lumbye (1879–1959), had a story to tell about the piece's origin: \"One evening, Lumbye was invited to a formal celebration at the British Embassy in Copenhagen but, passing his regular haunt on the way, he decided to spend the evening there in more familiar company. As he arrived back at the family home late in the evening, he was forced to explain how the embassy, which he had in fact never visited, had been wallowing in champagne and festivity. To illustrate it all for his curious family, he sat down at the piano and improvised a piece that would later be known as the world-famous Champagne Galop.\"\n\nIn his memoirs \"Mit Theaterliv\", Lumbye's friend, the ballet-master August Bournonville comments on the piece. \"While I by no means would ascribe the whole of Lumbye's success to the Champagne Galop, let me dwell for a moment on the impatient ferment brewing up in the first part, the cork popping off and the glasses being filled in the second part, a toast to good health, the frothy nectar downed in the third part and then a light-headed joy through the entire fourth part until a welcome \"Da Capo\" brings a new bottle to the table and all is swept up in a tumultuous bacchanale.\"\n\nThe piece is a good example of the entertaining music Lumbye liked to compose. Known as the Strauss of the North, he was a master at integrating popular dance rhythms into the compositions he wrote for those who came to his Tivoli concerts with. With its fast beat and melodious inventions, the Champagne Galop is known throughout Denmark but it is still surprising that Lumbye was so quick to include the xylophone in his symphony orchestra. It took quite a few years before the instrument became a part of orchestras elsewhere.\n\nIn recent years, the piece has gained increasing popularity on the international scene and was, for example, included in the Vienna Philharmonic's New Year's Concert in 2010 and 2015. With an average duration of 2 minutes, 23 seconds, it has been included in over 20 albums since 1993. The piece has also gained a lot of attention from the young people of Denmark, recently because of the Monte Carlo (radio programme), who uses the piece as a celebration fanfare when someone have won in their quiz.\n\nThe film \"Champagnegaloppen\" (1938), a musical, is based on Lumbye's music.\n"}

He played in critical debuts in New York City: the 1919 premier of John Drinkwater’s \"Abraham Lincoln\" and the lead role of Brutus Jones in the 1920 premier of Eugene O'Neill's \"The Emperor Jones\", also touring with the play. In 1920 he was the first black American to receive The Drama League's annual award as one of the 10 people who had done the most that year for American theatre.\n\nGilpin was born in Richmond, Virginia, to Peter Gilpin (a factory worker) and Caroline White (a nurse) ; he attended St. Francis RC School in that city. He started work as an apprentice in the \"Richmond Planet\" print shop before finding his career in theater. He first performed on stage as a singer at the age of 12. Prior to becoming a stage actor full-time, he worked as a printer and a pressman at several black newspapers during the late 1880s and into the 1890s, while getting some part-time work in vaudeville. He married Florence Howard in 1897, and they had one son. \n\nIn 1896 at the age of 18, Gilpin joined a minstrel show, leaving Richmond and beginning a life on the road that lasted for many years. When between performances on stage, like many performers, he worked odd jobs to earn money: as a printer, barber, boxing trainer, and railroad porter. In 1903, he joined Hamilton, Ontario's Canadian Jubilee Singers.\n\nIn 1905, he started performing with traveling musical troupes of the Red Cross and the Candy Shop of America. He also played his first dramatic roles and honed his character acting in Chicago. He performed with Robert Mott's Pekin Theater in Chicago for four years until 1911. Soon after, he toured the United States with the Pan-American Octetts. Gilpin worked with Rogers and Creamer's Old Man’s Boy Company in New York. In 1915, Gilpin joined the Anita Bush Players as they moved from the Lincoln Theater in Harlem to the Lafayette Theatre. As New York theater was expanding, this was a time when the theatrical careers of many famous black actors were launched.\n\nIn 1916, Gilpin made a memorable appearance in whiteface as Jacob McCloskey, a slave owner and villain of Dion Boucicault's \"The Octoroon\". Though Gilpin left Bush’s company over a salary dispute, his reputation allowed him to get the role of Rev. William Curtis in the 1919 premier of John Drinkwater’s \"Abraham Lincoln\".\n\nGilpin's Broadway debut led to his being cast in the premier of Eugene O’Neill’s \"The Emperor Jones\". He played the lead role of Brutus Jones to great critical acclaim, including a lauded review by writer Hubert Harrison in \"Negro World\". Gilpin's achievement resulted in The Drama League's naming him as one of the 10 people in 1920 who had done the most for American theater. He was the first black American so honored. Following the Drama League’s refusal to rescind the invitation, Gilpin refused to decline it. When the League invited Gilpin to their presentation dinner, some people found it controversial. At the dinner, he was given a standing ovation of unusual length when he accepted his award. Although Gilpin continued to perform the role of Brutus Jones in the U.S. tour that followed the Broadway closing of the play, he had a falling out with O'Neill. Gilpin wanted O'Neill to remove the word \"nigger\", which occurred frequently in the play. The playwright refused, asserting its use was consistent with his dramatic intentions.\n\nIn 1921, Gilpin was awarded the NAACP's Spingarn Medal. He was also honored at the White House by President Warren G. Harding. A year later, the Dumas Dramatic Club (now the Karamu Players) of Cleveland renamed itself the Gilpin Players in his honor.\n\nWhen they could not come to a reconciliation, O'Neill replaced Gilpin with Paul Robeson as Brutus Jones in the London production.\n\nIn early April 1922, Gilpin became one of the first black performers to give a dramatic presentation on radio. He gave readings from \"The Emperor Jones\" over greater Boston station WGI, from their Medford Hillside studios.\n\nAfter the extended controversy and the disappointment of losing his signature role, Gilpin started drinking heavily. He never again performed on Broadway. He died in 1930 in Eldridge Park, New Jersey, his career in shambles. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, his funeral arranged by friends shortly after his death.\n\nIn 1991, 61 years after his death, Gilpin was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.\n\nO’Neill had major influence on African American actors, in particular Charles Gilpin and Paul Leroy Robeson. O’Neill and Robeson worked on three productions together: \"All God's Chillun Got Wings\" (1924), \"The Emperor Jones\" (1924), and \"The Hairy Ape\" (1931). Robeson, however, did not originate the lead role in O’Neill's \"The Emperor Jones\". Charles Sidney Gilpin, a respected leading man from the all-black Lafayette Players of Harlem, was the first actor to play the role of Brutus Jones when it was first staged on November 1, 1920, by the Provincetown Players at the Playwright's Theater in New York City. This production was O'Neill's first real smash hit. The Players' small theater was too small to cope with audience demand for tickets, and the play was transferred to another theater. It ran for 204 performances and was hugely popular, and toured in the States with this cast for the next two years. Gilpin continued to perform the role of Brutus Jones in the U.S. tour that followed the Broadway closing of the play, and In 1920 became the first black American to receive the Drama League of New York's annual award as one of the ten people who had done the most that year for American theater. The following year Gilpin was awarded the NAACP's Spingarn Medal. He was also honored at the White House by president Warren G. Harding. A year later, the Dumas Dramatic Club (now the Karamu Players) of Cleveland renamed itself the Gilpin Players in his honor. Though the acclaimed actor continued to perform in subsequent productions of the play, he eventually had a falling out with O'Neill who argued with Gilpin's tendency to change his use of the word \"nigger\" to \"Negro\" and \"colored\" during performances. Gilpin wanted O'Neill to remove the word \"nigger\" from the play altogether, which occurred frequently in the play, but the playwright refused, arguing its use was consistent with his dramatic intentions and that the use of language was, in fact, based on a friend, an African-American tavern-keeper on the New London waterfront that was O'Neill's favorite drinking spot in his home town. When they could not come to a reconciliation, O'Neill replaced the middle-aged Gilpin with the much younger and then unknown Paul Robeson, who had only performed on the concert stage. Robeson starred in the title role in the 1924 New York revival and in the London production. He received excellent reviews and, coupled with his performance in the 1928 London production of the musical \"Show Boat\", went on to worldwide fame as one of the great artists of the 20th century. The show was again revived in 1926 at the Mayfair Theatre in Manhattan, with Gilpin again starring as Jones and also directing the show. The production, which ran for 61 performances, is remembered today for the acting debut of a young Moss Hart as Smithers and broke social barriers and defied conventions of the day as the first American play to feature an African-American central character portrayed in a serious manner. The play was adapted for a 1933 feature film starring Paul Robeson, directed by Dudley Murphy, an avant-garde filmmaker of O'Neill's Greenwich Village circle who pursued the reluctant playwright for a decade before getting the rights from him. Gilpin continued to make a small living performing monologues from O'Neill's play at church gatherings, but after the extended controversy and the disappointment of losing his signature role, succumbed to depression and began drinking heavily. He never again performed on Broadway and died in 1930 in Eldridge Park, New Jersey, his career in shambles. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, his funeral arranged by friends shortly after his death. In recognition of his groundbreaking work, Gilpin was posthumously inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1991.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27691317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27691317", "title": "Classic book", "text": "Classic book\n\nA \"classic\" is a book accepted as being exemplary or noteworthy, for example through an imprimatur such as being listed in a list of great books, or through a reader's personal opinion. Although the term is often associated with the Western canon, it can be applied to works of literature from all traditions, such as the Chinese classics or the Indian Vedas.\n\nWhat makes a book \"classic\" is a concern that has occurred to various authors ranging from Italo Calvino to Mark Twain and the related questions of \"Why Read the Classics?\" and \"What Is a Classic?\" have been essayed by authors from different genres and eras (including Calvino, T. S. Eliot, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve). The ability of a classic book to be reinterpreted, to seemingly be renewed in the interests of generations of readers succeeding its creation, is a theme that is seen in the writings of literary critics including Michael Dirda, Ezra Pound, and Sainte-Beuve.\n\nThe terms \"classic book\" and \"Western canon\" are closely related concepts, but they are not necessarily synonymous. A \"canon\" refers to a list of books considered to be \"essential\" and is presented in a variety of ways. It can be published as a collection (such as Great Books of the Western World, Modern Library, or Penguin Classics), presented as a list with an academic’s imprimatur (such as Harold Bloom's) or be the official reading list of an institution of higher learning (such as \"The Reading List\" at St. John's College or Rutgers University.\n\nIn the 1980s, Italo Calvino said in his essay \"Why Read the Classics?\" that \"a classic is a book that has never finished saying what it has to say\" and comes to the crux of personal choice in this matter when he says (italics in the original translation): \"\"Your\" classic author is the one you cannot feel indifferent to, who helps you define yourself in relation to him, even in dispute with him.\" Consideration of what makes a literary work a classic is for Calvino ultimately a personal choice, and, constructing a universal definition of what constitutes a Classic Book seems to him to be an impossibility, since, as Calvino says \"There is nothing for it but for all of us to invent our own ideal libraries of classics.\"\n\nWhat actually makes a work of literature a \"classic book\" is not just a consideration of extensively published authors. In 1920, Fannie M. Clark, a teacher at the Rozelle School in East Cleveland, Ohio, predates Calvino's similar conclusions by 60 years when she also essayed the question of what makes a book a \"classic\" in her article \"Teaching Children to Choose\" in \"The English Journal\".\n\nOver the course of her essay, Clark considers the question of what makes a piece of literature a classic and why the idea of \"the classics\" is important to society as a whole. Clark says that \"teachers of English have been so long trained in the 'classics' that these 'classics' have become to them very much like the Bible, for the safety of which the rise of modern science causes such unnecessary fears.\" She goes on to say that among the sources she consulted was a group of eighth-graders when she asked them the question: \"What do you understand by the classics in literature?\" Two of the answers Clark received were \"Classics are books your fathers give you and you keep them to give to your children\" and \"Classics are those great pieces of literature considered worthy to be studied in English classes of high school or college\". Calvino agrees with the Ohio educator when he states \"Schools and universities ought to help us understand that no book that talks about a book says more than the book in question, but instead they do their level best to make us think the opposite.\" Clark and Calvino come to a similar conclusion that when a literary work is analyzed for what makes it 'classic', that in just the act of analysis or as Clark says \"the anatomical dissection\", the reader can end up destroying the unique pleasure that mere enjoyment a work of literature can hold.\n\nWhile blogging on the website guardian.co.uk in 2009, Chris Cox echoes Twain's \"classic\" sentiments of 1900 and Bennett's witticism about classic books when he opined on the Guardian.Co \"Books Blog\" that there are actually two kinds of \"classic novels\":\nThe first are those we know we should have read, but probably have not. These are generally the books that make us burn with shame when they come up in conversation... The second kind, meanwhile, are those books that we've read five times, can quote from on any occasion, and annoyingly push on to other people with the words: \"You have to read this. It's a classic.\"\nIn 1850, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve (1804–1869) stated his answer to the question \"What is a Classic?\" (\"Qu'est-ce qu'un classique?\"): The idea of a classic implies something that has continuance and consistence, and which produces unity and tradition, fashions and transmits itself, and endures…. A true classic, as I should like to hear it defined, is an author who has enriched the human mind, increased its treasure, and caused it to advance a step; who has discovered some moral and not equivocal truth, or revealed some eternal passion in that heart where all seemed known and discovered; who has expressed his thought, observation, or invention, in no matter what form, only provided it be broad and great, refined and sensible, sane and beautiful in itself; who has spoken to all in his own peculiar style, a style which is found to be also that of the whole world, a style new without neologism, new and old, easily contemporary with all time.\n\nIn this same essay, Sainte-Beuve quoted Goethe (referring to the 'classics' concept): \"Ancient works are classical not because they are old, but because they are powerful, fresh, and healthy.\"\n\nThe concept of 'the classic' was a theme of T.S. Eliot's literary criticism as well. In The Sacred Wood he thought that one of the reasons \"Dante is a classic, and Blake only a poet of genius was \"because of \"the concentration resulting from a framework of mythology and theology and philosophy\". (In commenting about Eliot's influence, Professor Jan Gorak stated that \"the idea of a canon has become intertwined with the idea of the classic, an idea that T.S. Eliot tried to revitalize for the 'modern experiment'\".) In echoes of Sainte-Beuve, Eliot gave a speech to the Virgil Society concerning himself with the very same question of \"What is a Classic?\" In his opinion, there was only one author who was 'classic': \"No modern language can hope to produce a classic, in the sense I have called Virgil a classic. Our classic, the classic of all Europe, is Virgil.\" In this instance, though, Eliot said that the word had different meanings in different surroundings and that his concern was with \"one meaning in one context\". He states his focus is to define only \"one kind of art\" and that it does not have to be \"better...than another kind\". His opening paragraph makes a clear distinction between his particular meaning of classic having Virgil as the classic of all literature and the alternate meaning of classic as \"a standard author\".\n\nLiterary figures from different eras have also weighed in (sometimes humorously) on the matter. Alan Bennett, the modern English playwright and author, said that \"Definition of a classic: a book everyone is assumed to have read and often thinks they have read themselves.\" Mark Van Doren, the Columbia University professor and poet, is quoted by Jim Trelease (in his library-monograph \"Classic Picture Books All Children Should Experience\"), as saying that \"A classic is any book that stays in print\". And in his \"Disappearance of Literature\" speech given over a century ago in 1900, Mark Twain said, (referring to a learned academic's lofty opinion of Milton's \"Paradise Lost\") that the work met the Professor's definition of a classic as \"something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read\".\n\nClassics are often defined in terms of their lasting freshness. Clifton Fadiman thought that the works that become classic books have their start in childhood, saying that \"If you wish to live long in the memory of men, you should not write for them at all. You should write what their children will enjoy.\" In his view, the works we now judge to be classics are \"great starters\". Fadiman unites classic books through the ages in a continuum (and concurs with Goethe's thoughts on the vigor and relevance of the ancient Classics), when he states that classic books share a \"quality of beginningness\" with the legendary writer of the Iliad and the Odyssey – Homer himself. Ezra Pound in his own tome on reading, \"ABC of Reading\", gave his opinion when he stated, \"A classic is classic not because it conforms to certain structural rule, or fits certain definitions (of which its author had quite probably never heard). It is classic because of a certain eternal and irrepressible freshness.\" Michael Dirda, the 1993 Pulitzer Prize winning critic, concurred with Pound's view regarding the vitality of a classic when he wrote that \"...one of the true elements of a classic\" was that \"they can be read again and again with ever-deepening pleasure.\"\n\nPublishing houses (e.g., Easton Press, Franklin Library, and Folio Society) and colleges/universities (such as Oxford University Press and Yale University Press) are at times in the business of classic books. Publishers have their various types of \"classic book\" lines, while colleges and universities have required reading lists as well as associated publishing interests. If these books are the works of literature that well-read people are supposed to have read or at least be familiar with, then the genesis of the classic book genre and the processes through which texts are considered for selection (or not) is of interest. The development of the Penguin Classics line of books, among the best-known of the classic imprints, can serve as a good example.\n\nPenguin Books, the parent company of Penguin Classics, had its inception during the 1930s when the founder, Allen Lane, was unable to find a book he actually wanted to read while at Exeter train station. As the company website tells it, \"appalled by the selection on offer, Lane decided that good quality contemporary fiction should be made available at an attractive price and sold not just in traditional bookshops, but also in railway stations, tobacconists and chain stores.\"\n\nSir Allen, in speaking of Penguin Books, said: \"We believed in the existence in this country of a vast reading public and staked everything on it.\" Within the first year, they had sold three million paperbacks of then-contemporary authors, such as Agatha Christie, Ernest Hemingway, and Andre Maurois.\n\n\"Classic Books\" reading lists now in use at some universities have been in modern vogue since at least the early part of the 20th century, with the additional impetus in 1909 of the Harvard Classics publishing imprimatur having individual works chosen by outgoing Harvard University president Charles W. Eliot. The vogue for these \"Reading Lists\" has continued onto the 21st century, e.g., Jane Mallison's \"Book Smart: Your Essential Reading List for Becoming a Literary Genius in 365 Days\" (2007).\n\n"}
{"id": "34062674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34062674", "title": "Comedic journalism", "text": "Comedic journalism\n\nComedic journalism is a new form of journalism, popularized in the twenty-first century, that incorporates a comedic tone to transmit the news to mass audiences, using humour and/or satire to relay a point in news reports. Comedic journalism has been applied to print media in the past but has experienced a resurgence through the medium of television with shows such as \"The Daily Show\", \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\", and \"The Rick Mercer Report\". Conversely, there has been much criticism about defining these media outlets as “journalism”, since some scholars believe there should be a distinction kept between comedy and journalism.\n\nAn early example of comedic journalism in Canada is \"Frank\" magazine, founded in Nova Scotia in 1987. According to their website, \"Frank\" is a source of news, satire, opinion, comment and humour. They were inspired by the UK magazine \"Private Eye\", which also uses satire and comedy when reporting on current affairs. \"Frank\" not only focuses on current affairs, but also existing stories long after they have disappeared from mainstream news media. Many consider the magazine to be a “scandal sheet”, a news source that should not be taken seriously. However, \"Frank\" magazine’s counter-argument is that the only thing “wicked” about them is how they expose the sins of others.\n\nIn 1989, \"Frank\" magazine also started circulating in Ottawa. This version of the magazine was not as popular as the original and stopped circulation both in print and online in 2008. Publisher Michael Bates believed that the downfall of the magazine was the rise in popularity of the satirical form of journalism in the twenty-first century. He explained that they had the field of satirical journalism to themselves in the 1990s, but more publications started to pick up this form of journalism and the Ottawa magazine could no longer compete. He also mentioned the rise of the internet as a cause for the new popularity of this form of media.\n\nJames W. Carey did not believe that journalists could be defined as conveyors of information. Instead, he presented two alternate viewpoints of communication: the transmission view of communication and the ritual view of communication. The transmission view of communication highlights the importance of information being sent out over large distances in order to convey knowledge and ideas to a mass audience. This viewpoint is more commonly seen in industrial communities where focus is put on the extension of the message. Alternatively, the ritual viewpoint of communication focuses more on the sharing of information amongst a large group of people. Therefore, the focus is not on the extension of the message, but towards the maintenance of society over time. Carey argued that this viewpoint is not as prevalent in American society because the concept of culture is weak in American social thought.\n\nCarey’s transmission viewpoint of communication is evident in traditional forms of journalism because the main purpose is to report the news in an objective manner in order to transmit information to a mass audience without any external viewpoints being included. This form of journalism is very informational and acts as an instrument for disseminating news and information in a packaged format across large distances. An example of this would be daily newspapers because they are packaged and send out bits of information, their sole purpose being to transmit the news to a mass audience. Alternatively, comedic journalism employs a ritualistic viewpoint of communication in the way it presents the news. Their main focus is not just to transmit information, but to place that information in a cultural context. This form of journalism reports news in a subjective manner in order to portray the information in a particular way. Therefore, comedic journalists are able to integrate different cultural viewpoints in their reporting of the news, which creates an element of community amongst their audience.\n\nJournalist Katerina Cizek describes the importance of the relationship between journalism and community in her article “When Community and Journalism Converge”. Cizek claims that she encountered journalism only when she had come to an understanding of community. In the summer of 1990, Cizek was assigned as a photojournalist on the Oka Crisis in Ottawa. This involved a confrontation between the Canadian government and armed forces against a Mohawk community. Experiencing the event first-hand and later watching the events through news media, Cizek realized the troubling disconnect between what she was watching and what had actually occurred. The news reports did not accurately represent the views of the Mohawk community that she had witnessed. Those who did report on the community’s interests were ridiculed and accused of Stockholm syndrome. Therefore, traditional news media would only accept the viewpoints of those in power and ignored the importance of the community’s viewpoint.\n\nJoy Mayer also explains the importance of this disconnect in her article, “Engaging Communities: Content and Conversation”. Mayer proposes a new element that needs to be integrated in today’s journalism which is the obligation to make a connection with those they are reporting to. This stems from her issue with the separation between journalists and community. She blames this distancing on the notion of objectivity that is prevalent in traditional forms of news media. This is because journalists are forced to make a disconnection in order to report the news in a fair manner. As a result, traditional forms of news media provide only a limited and emotionless account of news events.\n\nComedic journalism has attracted a large following, and one cause is the increasing cynicism found in and inspired by traditional news sources. Since the income of a news source is tied to their number of viewers, many news sources will do whatever it takes to gain the public’s attention. This includes reporting on the information journalists and media elite genuinely think the public should know, however, this also includes alternative attention-drawing tactics such as “attack journalism,” portraying politics as “endlessly adversarial,” and contributing to a “feeding frenzy,” or excessive press coverage of an embarrassing or scandalous subject. Scandals and drama are effective in drawing viewers, but facing negative topics or the sensational reporting style again and again can frustrate viewers. The comedic, satirical portrayal of happenings in comedy news sources can offer an alternative method of receiving news, one that is frequently received in a positive light due to its entertaining qualities. This in turn has enabled comedic journalism to not just survive in the competitive world of news coverage, but to thrive in drawing significant audiences. With the range of their voice, the influential capability of comedic journalism grows.\n\nJoe Hale Cutbirth in his article “Satire as Journalism: The Daily Show and American Politics at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century” explains the recent popularity of satirical journalism and relates this to the sense of community that viewers feel through this form of journalism. In comparison to traditional forms of news media, which are objective and authoritative, current forms of news media have evolved with popularity due to an independent and personal voice that is reporting the news to viewers with tools such as comedy and satire. Cutbirth uses the example of \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\", where news events are reported in a satirical manner by comedian Jon Stewart. Through his form of news reporting, audiences are able to make a connection to the news he is reporting on and feel as though their concerns and values are being incorporated in the news. Stewart is using comedy as a form of communication which provides the audience with a sense of emotion that they do not get with traditional news media. Cutbirth also raises Carey’s argument on the significance of journalism for the public sphere. He argues that if news sources only reflect the interests of few (usually the elites in society), people will not involve themselves in public life. Therefore, by Stewart’s integration of different viewpoints and emotions on news events, his viewers feel they can relate to Stewart and others who are also following his show, creating a sense of community and integration into public life.\n\nThe following three television shows can be viewed as modern examples of comedic journalism. The hosts of these shows report on current news events, using a comedic tone to highlight the issues that the audience should take away from the reports.\n\n\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\" started in January 1999, when Jon Stewart took over the hosting position from Craig Kilborn. The show was presented as a comedy show where news was reported in a satirical manner, mocking the way it was originally presented and reported in traditional forms of news media. Stewart has long denied considering himself a journalist and claims that his show reports on “fake news”. However, studies have shown that many young adults rely on his show for political information. In one survey, Stewart was voted the most trusted news source in the United States. The satirical nature of his show has exposed flaws in the objective news reporting of traditional media. As a result, audiences have turned to Stewart for a more intellectual and emotional account of news, which was lacking in their experience with traditional news media. Geoffrey Baym also argues that \"The Daily Show\" is not “fake news”, but a new form of journalism that draws on the genres of news, comedy, and television talk shows in order to report in a critical and democratic manner.\n\nIn Season 15, Episode 161, Stewart invites four 9/11 first responders onto the show, all of whom were dying as a result of their involvement during 9/11. Stewart speaks to the men about the Bill that was being passed to add health related funds for people involved in 9/11. Before their appearance on this show, the Republicans were still deciding if the law should be passed. Although Stewart reported this news in a humorous manner, this form of journalism had such an impact that the Republicans felt “embarrassed” by what was shown on his show and passed the law. In a New York Times article written about this episode, Stewart is compared to Edward R. Murrow, a famous journalist in the past, legitimizing him as a journalist.\n\nThe Daily Show with Jon Stewart ended in 2015 and replaced with The Daily Show with Trevor Noah.\n\n\"The Colbert Report\" started in October 2005 with Stephen Colbert as the host, writer and executive producer of the show. Like Stewart, Colbert reports the news in a satirical manner, focusing on political news. He uses different segments in his episodes such as, “Tip of the Hat, Wag of the Finger” and “Bears and Balls”. During these segments, Colbert discusses current news events and does not hold back from sharing his opinion on the stories. As he puts it in one episode, he not only gives his audience his two cents worth, but a whole bag of quarters. The cheers of the audience as he reports these segments illuminates the feelings of a community because the viewer knows there is a group of people who are laughing at Colbert along with themselves. Also, his high strung attitude in his reports creates a feeling of passion with the stories he is reporting on, causing the audience to have a deeper emotional connection with the news events that he reports on.\n\nIn season five of \"The Colbert Report\", Colbert launched his series of “Operation Iraqi Stephen: Going Commando” where he taped his shows in Iraq and became the first TV show in US history to produce shows in a combat zone. Although the title of the series is comedic, Colbert pushes the limit of journalism and gives his viewers a closer look at one of the most prevalent current affairs in the United States. He was bothered by the fact that the economic crisis in the United States had become the prevalent issue in the news. Not only did he start reporting on the War in Iraq more frequently, but actually reported on-scene in order to give his audience a deeper connection to the issue at hand.\n\nColbert Report ended on December 18, 2014 when Stephen Colbert became the host of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n\nLike Stewart and Colbert, Mercer reports current events in Canada in a satirical manner on \"The Rick Mercer Report\". The show takes the connection of comedic journalism and community a step further by incorporating forms of investigative journalism. Mercer frequently travels around Canada and uses techniques of investigative journalism to report on a wide range of topics. Mercer details his travels in his book, \"Rick Mercer Report: The Book\", and also discusses certain political current events that were occurring at the time of each episode. For example, Mercer travelled with the different political parties during their election campaigns in order to gain a personal account of the event. Although Mercer focuses on political events, he also covers many other issues that Canadians can relate to, such as environmental and economic issues.\n\nDuring the 2011 federal elections, Mercer urged youth to become politically active and give themselves a voice by voting. After his show aired, students from the University of Guelph created a “vote mob”, advocating for issues they believed affected their age group, such as harsh drug laws and lowering tuition fees. The vote mob was also created to encourage students at other universities to do the same. The low number of young voters has continued to be a problem in elections over the years, regardless of the number of reports that have previously been done. However, with Rick Mercer’s form of comedic journalism, he was successful in making a connection with these young voters and pushing them to make a change.\n\nJohn Oliver was a long-time correspondent on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. During the summer of 2013 he hosted the Daily Show while Jon Stewart was filming Rosewater. \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" started in April 2014.\n\nThere are critiques of comedic journalism, as some scholars and journalists argue that comedy cannot be seen as a valid form of journalism. They stress the importance of traditional news media and its objective nature in reporting the news. Ed Fouhy, a retired producer and network executive, claims that comedic journalism cannot be viewed as a serious source of information. Robert Thompson, director of a popular culture program at Syracuse University, adds that journalists should be more concerned with providing correct information than appealing to a younger audience and trying to be more “hip”.\n\nHowever, comedic journalists use these traditional news forms to gather their information and report it in a more subjective manner. The news stories they report on are the same stories reported by mainstream news media; however, comedic journalism reports them in a different way. Having the same news reported with a different tone is something many people are starting to prefer; as Cutbirth mentions in his article, many people would rather turn to these new forms of media because of the personal and subjective viewpoints they give. This is demonstrated by a study in which American citizens voted Jon Stewart their most trusted news source. Viewers seem more trusting of their sources when they feel an emotional connection to the news reports.\n\nOne article in the \"American Journalism Review\" suggests that mainstream media can actually learn from the journalistic form of Jon Stewart. Professor Brown, chair of the communications department at Syracuse University and an associate professor of broadcast journalism, was once a skeptic of Stewart’s form of comedy journalism, which he referred to as, “silly riffing”. However, at the start of the war in Iraq, Brown felt as though the traditional form of journalism in the mainstream media was not providing a fair account of the event. He claims that they were, “swallowing the administration’s spin rather than challenging it”. Stewart, on the other hand, was successful in covering the stories with various viewpoints in mind and therefore, steered closer to the truth than the mainstream journalists.\n\nPhil Rosenthal, a media columnist for the Chicago Tribune, draws on the fact that a big part of the news nowadays is the managing of the news. Comedic journalists such as Stewart and Colbert not only expose the subjects in the news stories, but also how the stories were delivered in the mainstream media. They often show clips of reporters conveying the news stories and mock the information that was provided. This highlights the tension between traditional journalism and this new form that has captured such a large audience. However, bearing in mind that the news from these comedic reports are derived from traditional news sources, Fouhy and others make a valid points that people need the resources for serious news and that people also need comedic journalism to help them sort out truths. Therefore, although comedic journalism is a newer form of journalism, it can work side-by-side with traditional forms for viewers to receive a more complete account of the news.\n"}

Teaching for 38 years, working with the Department of Education and the Commission on the Preservation of Virgin Islands Culture, Dorsch was a tireless advocate for conserving traditions of the Virgin Islands and teaching as a means of giving them life. She contributed two books on the history and traditions of the country and received many awards and honors in recognition of her work.\n\nDelta M. Jackson was born on March 26, 1915, in Frederiksted, on the island of St. Croix in the Danish West Indies, shortly before the territory became the U.S. Virgin Islands. After earning her high school degree, one of the first generation of women from St. Croix to do so, she obtained a degree in education from Central Michigan University. Continuing with her education, Jackson earned a master's degree from New York University (NYU) in 1951 and immediately enrolled to complete her doctorate at Columbia University in school administration. After finishing her PhD, Jackson furthered her education in Europe, studying education at the University of London and the University of Heidelberg, as part of the NYU Graduate Program.\n\nReturning to the Virgin Islands, Jackson began working as an elementary school teacher in the early 1950s. In 1955, she married Frederick D. Dorsch, who served as the Superintendent of Schools in the Virgin Islands prior to his death in 1960. Continuing to teach in the Virgin Island school system for thirty-eight years, Dorsch also taught both undergraduate and graduate courses at the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) at the campus on St. Croix. Between 1977 and 1982, she served the Virgin Islands Department of Education, as deputy commissioner of curriculum and worked as chairman of the board at St. Dunstan's Episcopal School.\n\nDorsch was dedicated to the preservation of cultural heritage, serving on the Commission on the Preservation of Virgin Islands Culture. She used storytelling to generate a platform for cultural conservation and collected folk tales to keep them alive. In 1983, when the St. Croix Heritage Dancers Organization inaugurated their annual ball, which recognizes two citizens for their contributions to cultural heritage, Dorsch and Vincent Harris were the chosen first honorees. After her retirement in 1988, Dorsch participated in many storytelling events, such as the Senegal Folklife Festival held at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. in 1990. She had particular interest in saving stories of Bru Nansi and Jumbie, which are particular to the Virgin Islands and its African past She wrote a book entitled \"The Role of the Storyteller in the Preservation of Virgin Islands Culture\" (1999) and contributed to \"The Glory Days of Frederiksted (2004).\n\nIn 2010, UVI named the campus residence halls in her honor and Frederiksted's Dorsch Beach also bears her name.

Becher. Erich Kluge served as the organization's first chairman until January 1959, when he stepped down for reasons of ill health.

Siegfried Nitsche then served as first chairman from Hander's death in January 1968 until the organization was dissolved in December 1969.\n\nFollowing the group's dissolution, magicians' associations in East Germany were confined to the local level. In 1974 there were forty such associations, with a total membership of around 600. By 1990 the number of associations had risen to 52.\n\nOn 11 November 1989, ten magicians convened in Leipzig and made an application to the Ministry of Culture to revive the \"Magischer Zirkel der DDR\". Among the refounders were Hans-Georg Bucsi, Klaus Fürst, Hans-Gerhard Stumpf, and Annette Kirberg-Stumpf. The association was officially re-established on 6 January 1990. At its first conference on 10 March of that year, Hans-Gerhard Stumpf was elected president. Within a few months, Stumpf and the managing directors of the association met with their West German counterparts in the \"Magischer Zirkel von Deutschland\" to discuss unification of the two groups.

While airport models have been around, in a way, since air fields were open to the public, early model airports were basically restricted to public showcases about the airport and its surroundings to the public; these were usually located inside the airport themselves.\n\nOne of the first model airport toys available to the public was \"Fisher-Price's \"Little People's airport set, released in the 1970s.\n\nHowever, since Herpa Wings's introduction of their \"airport set\" series to their line of airline related toys, there has been an increase of aircraft modelers who have made mock airports to showcase their private collection of model aircraft. Usually, the collector will model their airport after a real life airport.\nMost of the time, collectors who make model airports use die-cast models for their creation. Among the brands of die cast aircraft models most commonly used on these airports are Schabak, Herpa Wings, Dragon Models Limited, Gemini Jets and others.\n\nModel airports could be made to look very realistic, with many real airport features such as terminals, control towers, cargo terminals, hangars, passenger bridges and more. Conversely, they could also be very simple, as some collectors just get a piece of paper, draw a runway on it, place it over a table, add their plane models and call it their model airport.\n\nIn 2011, what may be the world's largest model airport opened for public view at Miniatur Wunderland, Hamburg, Germany. \"Knuffingen International Airport\" is based on Hamburg International Airport.\n\nAnother popular park in Europe, Madurodam in the Netherlands, includes a model airport featuring models of several airlines such as KLM, Transavia, Thai Airways, Korean Air, Delta Air Lines and an A380 of Singapore Airlines.

In addition to Nandasiri, they have also performed with Walter Fernando (brother of the late baila singer M.S. Fernando), and female vocalist Malkanthi Nandasiri, during their tours of the United States.\n\nThe success Pahan Silu has enjoyed in recent years is owed primarily to the unique sound they have introduced to Sri Lankan music. In an era when many Sri Lankan performers (including pop-R&B duo Bathiya and Santhush) have drawn influence from urban and techno musicians in England and the United States, Pahan Silu turned, instead, to the rich, blended, harmonies of African music, and the acoustic rhythms of Latin American music.\n\nTheir first single, \"Siripāda\", a song recounting the story of a group of friends who climb to the top of Srī Pāda (also referred to as Adam's Peak) thru its dense pre-dawn fog, debuted on March 10, 2007 on The Asian Broadcasting Company's Sri Lankan affiliate Hiru FM.\n\nTheir second single, \"Mīrayèn Èha Thalè\", a song which describes Priyan's memory of the 2000 concert given by Pandith Amaradeva in the US, debuted on December 2, 2007 simultaneously on both the BBC and SLBC.\n\nIn December 2008, Pahan Silu collaborated with the Sudanese Gospel Choir to perform in a special edition of SirasaTV's \"Looks Like\" program broadcast in early 2009 which included the premier of their single \"Yala\".\n\nAmong others, founding member Priyan Weerappuli credits Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Sting, Papa Wemba, Pandith Amaradeva, John Denver, Clarence Wijewardane, James Taylor, Carlos Vives, Juanes and Aventura as the influences behind Pahan Silu's sound.\n\nDayani's Theme (Weerappuli 2007)\n\nSiripāda (S.Fernando/Weerappuli 2007)\n\nMīrayèn Èha Thalè (Weerappuli 2007)\n\nMihirakī Oba (Kannangara/Weerappuli 2008)\n\nYala (Weerappuli 2009)\n\nGamanak Yanowa (Weerappuli 2011)\n\nIura Dhige (Weerappuli/Jayasekera 2011)\n\nLelena Pahan Silu (Weerappuli 2012)\n\n\nCurrent Members (In Alphabetical Order)\n\nVenura Jayasekera (Acoustic Guitar, Bass Guitar, Keyboard, Vocals)\n\nShirantha Kannangara (Vocals)\n\nPramod Nugaliyadda (Sound Engineer)\n\nLochana Talagala (Acoustic Guitar, Bass Guitar)\n\nPriyan Weerappuli (Acoustic Guitar, Electric Guitar, Bass Guitar, Keyboard, Percussion, Thammátama, Vocals)\n\nGuest Performers (In Alphabetical Order)\n\nUmanga deSilva (Acoustic Guitar, Vocals)\n\nJacob Falk (Djembe, Congas)\n\nBrian Rishi Fernando (Acoustic Guitar)\n\nShripal Fernando (Vocals)\n\nPraveen Fernandopulle (Vocals)\n\nChinthana Herath (Flute, Violin)\n\nK.

{"id": "39350971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39350971", "title": "Pantsula", "text": "Pantsula\n\nPantsula is a tradition and also a highly energetic dance form that originated in the black townships of South Africa during the apartheid era. It developed into a form of social commentary for black South Africans and has undergone several transformations with the country's changing political tides.\n\nPantsula dance emerged in the 1950s and 1960s as a response to the forced removals implemented by the apartheid government, shortly after its ascent to power. It began in Alexandra and Sophiatown, two townships in Johannesburg, as groups of older men engaged in informal street dance competitions. Gradually the dance form spread throughout South Africa. By the 1980s, pantsula was practiced by black South Africans of all ages and was no longer limited to men. It began to develop more political overtones. Pantsula was used as an expression of resistance during the political struggle then occurring against the apartheid government, as well as being used to spread awareness about social issues such as AIDS. \n\nAfter the end of apartheid in 1994, pantsula persisted as an expression of cultural roots for many black South Africans. It also gained popularity in the white community of South Africa and has begun to take on new meanings as a dance form for all.\n\nPantsula is a syncopated, quick-stepping, low to the ground form of dance which evokes the urban street culture of which it is a part. It is performed by groups of dancers who practice together for many hours each week. It provides a powerful, stylized form of expression. As one pantsula dancer describes it, \"we have drive, we are one, we have power, we are young, strong and quick, we have our own style and we are competitive.\" \n\nIt developed from the Sotho dances of mqaquanga and marabi, with influence from 1930s American jazz. Later evolutions of pantsula dancing in the 1980s were influenced by American hip hop and breakdance. Quick, darting steps in geometric lines with an uneven rhythmic quality characterize this form of movement. The Charleston, a knock-kneed manoeuvre from American jazz, as well as the popping and locking found in US hip hop, are also found in this form of dance. The word \"pantsula\" is Zulu, and refers to \"waddling like a duck.\" This flat-footed move with the buttocks sticking out is commonplace in the dance form.\n\nPantsula has three styles: Western Style, Slow Poison, and Futhuza. Western Style is the most typically found form, and it is highly rigorous. The arms remain wrapped around an upright torso while the feet move in extremely fast and particular shuffling and jumping movements as groups of dancers move in and out of geometric formations. This form requires good physical command of the body. Slow Poison is like Western style in form, with mostly stationary arms and intricate lower body movements, but it is performed in a slow, steady fashion with a constant beat. Futhuza is infused with elements of American breakdancing and hiphop. This form utilizes the somewhat disjointed, sometimes fluid, robotic motion of popping and locking.\n\nOriginally, pantsula dancers did not have access to recorded music and danced to live music, including voices like Bra Sello and \"Big Voice Jack\" Lerole. As radios became more readily available, dancers opted for international and US pop music, calling on icons like Michael Jackson as well as rappers including MC Hammer and Puff Daddy. However, in the 1990s, a particular type of music for pantsula emerged: kwaito. This multilingual music is typical of the myriad of cultures in South Africa, and is a blend of seSotho, isiZulu, English, and Afrikaans. It is strong and sharp, like pantsula, and projects a streetwise, gangster image. \n\n"}

The plays were in Gujarati, Hindi and Urdu, and after its beginning in Bombay, soon it developed into various travelling theatre companies, which toured across India, especially north and western India (now Gujarat and Maharashtra), popularizing proscenium-style theatre in regional languages.\n\nEntertainment-driven and incorporating musical theatre and folk theatre, in early 1900s, some Parsi theatre producers switched to new media like bioscope and subsequently many became film producers. The theatre diminished in popularity, with arrival of talkies era in Hindi cinema in 1930s. Post-independence, it experienced a revival in the 1950s, much like theatre in the rest of the India.\n\nThe British community in Bombay had been staging theatre in English language for sometime by the mid-19th century. Parsis were a prominent business community in the city. In early 1850s, the students of Elphinstone College in Mumbai had formed a dramatic society and started performing Shakespeare. The first Parsi Theatre company called \"Pārsī Nāṭak Maṇḍali\" performed their first play \"Roostum Zabooli and Sohrab\" in 1853, followed by \"King Afrasiab and Rustom Pehlvan\" and \"Pādśāh Faredun\". By 1860 over 20 Parsi theatre groups were formed in Mumbai.\n\nThe early plays in Parsi theatre presented Indianized versions of Shakespeare’s plays, by turning them into folk performances, with dozens of songs added in. Soon Indian legends, epic and mythological tales made an appearance as source material. As Parsi theatre companies started travelling across North India, they employed native writers to churn out scripts in Hindustani language, mix of Hindi and Urdu.\n\nLater Parsi plays \"blended realism and fantasy, music and dance, narrative and spectacle, earthy dialogue and ingenuity of stage presentation, integrating them into a dramatic discourse of melodrama\". For mass appeal the plays incorporated humour, melodious songs and music, sensationalism and stagecraft. The success of Parsi theatre lead to the development of theatre in regional languages notably modern Gujarati theatre, Marathi theatre and Hindi theatre. Later it led to the development of Hindi cinema (Bollywood), the effect of Parsi theatre is still evident in the Masala film genre of Indian cinema, and especially in Bollywood film songs.\n\nParsi theatre was also popular in South-East Asia, where it was known as \"Wyang Parsi\" and often imitated.\n\nIn 1981, Mumbai-based theatre director Nadira Babbar, started her theatre group \"Ekjute\" (Together), with the production of \"Yahudi Ki Ladki\", which revived the Parsi theatre style, and is considered one of its finest.\n\n"}

He was then picked up to work on P&O and Princess Cruises. In 2006 he was one of only 18 teens chosen worldwide to compete at the World Magic Seminar. In 2007 he was requested to come back and do a second performance during the APEC conference.\n\nPiP produced his first public shows at the 2009 Melbourne International Comedy Festival with two shows, Hypnolarious & The Funny Side of Prestidigitation. He would perform both of these nightly during the entire 4-week festival with a total of 46 shows.\n\nLater that year he created The Magic Club, a fortnightly show billed as \"like a comedy club but with magicians instead\". Shows would feature young up and coming performers competing for cash prizes followed by a set from a Professional Magician. The first season was a sell out success prompting the show to be moved to Sydney's iconic venue The Basement for most of the second season before finishing at The Laugh Garage.\n\nPiP continued to tour his shows Hypnolarious and The Funny Side of Prestidigitation around Australia to critical acclaim.\n\nPiP's biggest career break came in 2012 when he became a contestant on Australia's Got Talent where he reached the Semi Finals. The judges loved his mixture of comedy and illusions with Danni Minogue saying \"We have never had anything like that on the show before... and it was great\" and Kyle Sandilands wanting to know where to get one of the dolls that turn into a girl.\n\nDuring his semi-final appearance on AGT one of the judges commented about a mistake made. When asked about this on qooh.me PiP said \"There were a lot of tech issues during my performance that were beyond my control sadly. Before I go into them I will give you a bit of background on the whole thing. For my second appearance on the show I had been asked to do an escape and so I created and built the entire illusion from scratch ... The biggest issue overall was a lack of prep time for the illusion. I was locked in to appear on the 8th semi final but then received a call to tell me I had to have it ready in 2 weeks to appear on the first semi final. We had only just finished building everything when they came to pick it all up to take to set so the weeks I had planned to run the routine and get it perfect didn't happen. During the filming a problem happened during the card trick which left me having to ad lib a little plus a few other things a long the way ... I have never really been happy with it and wish I could have had the time to get the routine better but it still was a lot of fun to do. I also think had it have been better I would have had the chance to do a routine I had been working on for years that would have been complete unique and like nothing you will ever see on the show (so big it needed permission from the government to do).\"\n\nIn 2010 PiP took control of his health and in 12 weeks lost 30 kg.\n\nPiP has given up much of his time to be a part of many events and fundraisers for countless charity’s and not-for-profit organisations including cancer research, emergency fund reliefs and he is an Ambassador for Barnardos Australia and Books In Homes.\n\nAs an Ambassador for Barnardo's Australia, PiP appears at events they hold as well as putting on shows where the profits go to Barnardo's. His connection with the organisation was strengthened after having worked with the organisation for over a year he learnt that his grandfather had once been looked after by them.\n\nAs an Ambassador for Books in Homes, PiP makes appearances at Primary Schools in disadvantaged areas, talking to the children as well as performing magic and presenting them with their books. He helps to encourage their love for reading and continuing further education.\n\nPiP also has a fundraising program that he has brought over from Canada where it has been extremely successful.

{"id": "13673555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13673555", "title": "President (1924 steamboat)", "text": "President (1924 steamboat)\n\nPresident is a steamboat that currently lies dismantled in Effingham, Illinois. Originally named \"Cincinnati\", it was built in 1924 and is the only remaining \"Western Rivers\" style sidewheel river excursion steamboat in the United States. She was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989, although these designations were revoked in 2011. Her home ports have been Cincinnati, Ohio; New Orleans, Louisiana; Vicksburg, Mississippi; St. Louis, Missouri; and Davenport, Iowa.\n\nBuilt in 1924 by the Midland Barge Company for John W. Hubbard of Pittsburgh and then known as \"Cincinnati\", she was originally planned as an overnight packet boat which carried passengers and freight from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Louisville, Kentucky during the summer. Once the hull was in Cincinnati, the owners expanded the passenger capacity by building two cabin-decks. The operators, Louisville & Cincinnati Packet Company, ran excursions, making its maiden voyage downstream to New Orleans for Mardi Gras in 1924. They operated Mardi Gras excursions for consecutive years through 1930. Sometimes \"Cincinnati\" cruised upriver into the Pittsburgh area.\n\nStreckfus Steamers acquired the \"Cincinnati\" in 1933 and stripped it down to its hull. They refitted the hull with 24 watertight compartments, then built five decks encased within an all-steel superstructure. The company moved her to her new home port of St. Louis, Missouri, where she served the upscale excursion market. Renamed as \"President\", the newly renovated 285-foot sidewheeler could accommodate 3,000 passengers and the ballroom could host 1,000 dancers. The cabins were built with an open design and the lido was built without a Texas deck.\n\nNewly converted and newly named, she opened for business in 1934. Streckfus advertised her as \"the New 5 Deck Luxury Super Steamer, Biggest and Finest On The Upper Mississippi\". She continued tramping (having no fixed schedule or published ports of call) until 1941. (In 1940, she was displaced from her position as flagship of the Streckfus line by the S.S. Admiral.)\n\nIn 1941, she switched her home port to New Orleans. Because fuel oil was restricted and many of the young crewmen joined the armed forces with the nation's entry into World War II, tramping was discontinued, and the cruises stayed close to home. After the war, \"President\" remained in New Orleans for many years as a popular music venue, featuring concerts by national acts such as U2, Cyndi Lauper, Men at Work, The Little River Band, and The Producers, and performances by New Orleans artists like Dr. John, The Neville Brothers, and The Cold. She was also seen in the 1958 Elvis Presley film, King Creole, featured prominently during the opening credits but with the larger displayed name repainted near the sidewheel to read SS New Orleans.\n\nBecause the wind made maneuvering the big boat difficult, she had her two side wheels removed and replaced by diesel engines in 1978.\n\nShe was sold in 1985 and returned to St. Louis as her home port. While there, she was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark on Dec. 20, 1989.\n\nOn July 27, 2011, the Department of the Interior issued a press release that included the following line; \"Finally, President, a steamboat in St. Elmo, Illinois, had its designation as a National Historic Landmark withdrawn because of a loss of historic integrity.\" The ship was also removed from the National Register entirely.\n\nIn 1990, \"President\" sailed her last dinner and dancing cruise before undergoing a ten million dollar renovation and conversion into a floating casino. She was purchased by what is now known as Isle of Capri Casinos. In 1991, Iowa legalized riverboat gambling and the \"President\" opened in Davenport, Iowa, with of gaming space. She was the second riverboat casino in the United States in modern times (opening 30 minutes after the first riverboat casino the M/V Diamond Lady opened in Bettendorf, Iowa, which was owned by Bernie Goldstein).\n\n\"President\" retired from service in 1999 and was reported, in 2004, to be located on the Yazoo River in Mississippi. At that time, she was for sale by Isle of Capri Casinos. She was also located for a time at Treasure Island in Lake McKellar at Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nIn January 2009, \"President\" was located in Alton, Illinois, where she had been listed by the National Park Service as of November 2007. She was disassembled and moved in pieces to St. Elmo, Illinois, near Effingham. Although local businesspeople hope to re-assemble her as a non-floating tourist attraction and hotel, financing has yet to be secured.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17713642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17713642", "title": "Saints Row: The Third", "text": "Saints Row: The Third\n\nSaints Row: The Third is an open world action-adventure video game developed by Volition and published by THQ. It is the third title in the \"Saints Row\" series. As in the previous games, the player-character leads the Third Streets Saints gang in a turf war against three rival gangs using a variety of weapons and vehicles in single-player and cooperative play. It was released on November 15, 2011 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. A Nintendo Switch port was announced by Deep Silver and is scheduled for a 2019 release.\n\nGame development began by late 2008. There was high staff turnover from the previous \"Saints Row\" team, with only one-fifth of the final 100-person staff having worked on a previous title in the series. They aimed to improve on the series by giving the game a coherent tone, and found it in films such as \"Hot Fuzz\" and the game's signature sex toy bat. \"Saints Row: The Third\" was built using a proprietary engine known as Core Technology Group and the Havok physics engine.\n\nThe game received positive reviews, reviewers noted its general zaniness and praised its customization options. Critics thought the setting was insipid and that its humor occasionally fell flat, and others thought the game perfected the \"Saints Row\" formula. It was a nominee for Best Narrative at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, an IGN Editor's Choice, and a recipient of perfect scores from \"GamesRadar\" and \"G4\". A complete edition including the was released a year after the original release, and its planned \"Enter the Dominatrix\" expansion became the game's sequel, \"Saints Row IV\".\n\n\"Saints Row: The Third\" is an action-adventure game played from the third-person perspective in an open world, such that players explore an unrestricted environment. Similar to the premise of the previous \"Saints Row\" games, the player's goal is to lead the Third Street Saints gang to overtake its rival gangs in the city turf war. While the protagonist is the same, the game introduces a new setting, the city of Steelport, with its new gangs: the Morningstar, Luchadores, and Deckers, together known as the Syndicate. Once The Syndicate is defeated, the government's Special Tactical Anti-Gang unit (STAG) is summoned to quell the Saints. \"The Third\" is the first in the series to intertwine the narratives of its three-gang structures, and also presents the player with story-altering decisions.\n\nPlayers customize their characters after the introductory mission. Player-character bodies, dress, and vehicles can be customized, as well as home properties. Players can additionally share their character designs in a \"Saints Row\" online community. Apart from the main story missions, there are optional diversions to make money and earn reputation, such as Insurance Fraud, where players hurt themselves in traffic to maximize self-injury before a timer expires, or Mayhem, where players maximize property destruction before a time expires. Some of these diversions were introduced in previous \"Saints Row\" games. Activities serve the plot and are positioned as training the player-character or damaging the Syndicate. They can also be repeated. Outside of structured diversions, players are free to make their own fun by purchasing property, shopping for items, finding hidden sex doll and money cache collectibles, and wreaking unsolicited havoc. There are also \"flashpoint\" gang operations that grant respect when disrupted. Attacking others increases the player's notoriety level, as depicted with stars.\n\n\"Saints Row: The Third\" introduced experience levels and weapon upgrades to the series. Most actions in the game come with incentives in the form of money and respect (reputation). Money buys land, weapons, and other upgrades, and respect is a kind of experience point that can unlock player abilities like \"no damage from falling\" or \"infinite sprint\", as well as upgrades to the player's computer-controlled gang member support. In turn, players receive further incentive to nearly miss car collisions, streak naked through the streets, shoot others in the groin, blow up Smart cars, and kill mascots in ambient challenges to earn more respect. Lack of respect does not hinder story progress, as it has in previous games. Player progress and unlocks are managed by an in-game cell phone menu that also lets the player call for vehicle deliveries and non-player character backup. The computer-controlled support will also dialogue with each other.\n\nFive years after the events of \"Saints Row 2\", the 3rd Street Saints have merged with the Ultor Corporation to become a media and consumer empire, with assets that include an energy drink, a lifestyle brand, and a chain of clothing stores. While robbing a bank to promote the upcoming \"Saints Row: The Movie\", the Boss and top lieutenants Shaundi and Johnny Gat experience unanticipated resistance from the staff and are arrested by corrupt policemen. They are turned over to Phillipe Loren, the mastermind behind an international criminal enterprise known as the \"Syndicate\", who wishes to make a deal with them, seeing the Saints as a threat. The Saints refuse and stage a breakout, with Gat seemingly sacrificing himself to allow Shaundi and the Boss to escape.\n\nThey land in Steelport, a city ruled by the Syndicate, which is dominated by three gangs: the Morningstar, led by Loren and the DeWynter sisters who are in control of Steelport's sex trade, the Luchadores, a Mexican masked wrestler-themed gang led by undefeated wrestling champion Eddie \"Killbane\" Pryor, and the Deckers, a unit of talented cyber-goth hackers led by British programmer Matt Miller. With no money or weapons, the Boss contacts another lieutenant, Pierce Washington, and has him provide manpower for a raid on the city's arsenal. Using their new firepower, the Saints enter Morningstar territory and begin attacking their interests. They then hunt down Loren in his own building, freeing Oleg Kirrlov, a former KGB agent turned test subject for the Syndicate's cloning initiative. After the Boss kills Loren by crushing him with a heavy chandelier, they either destroy the building or claim it for the Saints, declaring victory over the Syndicate regardless.\n\nDuring the opening of a new city bridge by the Senator Monica Hughes (dedicated to her husband), the Luchadores stage an ambush and kill several dozen Saints. To retaliate, the Boss seeks out individuals with grudges against the Syndicate. The search nets Kinzie Kensington, an ex-FBI agent targeted by the Deckers for investigating them, Zimos, an old pimp who lost his business to the Morningstar, and Angel de la Muerte, Killbane's embittered former wrestling partner. The Boss helps Zimos reestablish his prostitution ring, wrecking the Morningstar's influence to the point where Killbane tries to wrest control from the DeWynter sisters, who had inherited the gang from Loren. After the elder sister, Kiki, is murdered by Killbane in a jealous rage, her sister Viola defects to the Saints. Meanwhile, the federal government, under pressure to confront the growing lawlessness in Steelport, forms the Special Tactical Anti-Gang (S.T.A.G.) task force under the leadership of Cyrus Temple and Senator Monica Hughes. Armed with highly advanced technology, STAG puts the city under martial law until order can be restored.\n\nNext, Kinzie leads a successful effort to drive the Deckers out of Steelport, causing Miller to abandon the Syndicate and return to his home country after losing a virtual fight to the Boss. Finally, alongside Muerte, the Boss enters \"Murderbrawl XXXI\" and humiliates Killbane by defeating him in physical combat. With his image shattered, Killbane goes on a rampage through Steelport. While working to contain the damage, the Boss is informed that STAG, in an attempt to discredit the Saints, has rigged the Steelport Monument with explosives, leaving several kidnapped Saints, including Shaundi, Viola, and Mayor Burt Reynolds at the site to frame them. At the same time, Killbane is fleeing the country by private flight.\n\nIn the first, canonical ending, the Boss lets Killbane escape in order to disarm the explosives, killing Cyrus's lieutenant Kia in the process. With STAG's crimes exposed, the Saints are hailed by the people of Steelport as heroes. Killbane is subsequently killed while trying to organize an invasion of Earth from Mars, but the whole thing is then revealed to be the final scene from \"Gangstas In Space\", a film financed by the Saints and starring the Boss. In the second, alternate ending, the Boss kills Killbane, but the destruction of the monument gives STAG the opportunity to launch \"Daedalus\", a floating aircraft carrier helmed by Cyrus himself. After destroying the Daedalus with a series of bombs, the Boss, now armed with STAG weaponry and equipment, declares Steelport an independent nation ruled by the Saints.\n\n\"Saints Row 2\" design philosophy was to \"put everything ... into the game\", which made for a disjointed title with varied tone. Design director Scott Phillips said the series' legacy of lightheartedness made the sequel's tone hard to define. The development team withstood a high turnover between the two releases, with only a fifth of the final 100-person team having worked on a title in the series before. \"Saints Row: The Third\" was in development by September 2008 as \"Saints Row 3\". For its first six months of development, the team tested a choice-based adventure concept featuring an undercover agent infiltrating the Saints, which was dropped for not aligning with the spirit of the series. Now without a vision, the team made a \"tone video\" with film segments and songs that would define the new title. The final version featured bits from \"Bad Boys II\", \"Shoot 'Em Up\", \"Hot Fuzz\", and Mötley Crüe's \"Kickstart My Heart\". The team worked in this direction to find a personality for \"Saints Row: The Third\", which it found in its signature \"dildo bat\". The idea started as one-off mission-specific weapon and the artists ran with the concept. Their design mantra became \"Embrace the Crazy; Fun Trumps All\".\n\nThey came to the conclusion that \"everything had to be 'over the top this time around so as to distinguish \"Saints Row: The Third\" from other open world titles and to make the franchise into a AAA title. The team increased playtesting to check for the action's pacing and \"setpiece moments\" within its overall flow. Producer Greg Donovan considered \"Saints Row: The Third\" a reboot of the franchise, \"cohesive\" in a way the prior two \"semi-serious\" entries were not. Other than \"over the top\" themes, the team wanted \"holy shit\" \"water cooler moments\" that players would remember forever and want to share. Phillips also \"didn't want the player to be a dick\".\n\nThe city of Steelport was designed such that the player could identify locations without needing a minimap, with a spatially recognizable skyline and iconic gang vehicles in specific regions.\n\nThe title was not shown at the 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) with the explanation that the company had spent the year \"rebuilding the technology\", but a tie-in movie was mentioned as in production and a \"Saints Row 3\" announcement was expected at the December Spike VGAs. \"Saints Row: The Third\" was finally announced officially in March 2011. The team wanted to include many different features and items, so scoping the final product became an issue. They laid out their ideas on a schedule and began to cut until over \"4000 man-days of scheduled work\" were removed, including features such as free-running (called \"freegunning\") and a cover system. Competitive multiplayer was removed due to its lack of popularity in the previous series entries. In retrospect, Phillips said he wanted to remove more. The studio borrowed people from other parts of the company to finish the project. Writer Drew Holmes expressed the difficulty in determining what was too risqué for the game. In keeping with series advertising, \"Saints Row: The Third\" included a porn star, Sasha Grey, in the production as a character voice. Other celebrity voice actors include Hulk Hogan and Daniel Dae Kim.\n\nThe development team also pre-visualized rough drafts to sketch ideas for others to advance. For example, the introductory airplane level was pre-visualized two years prior to its creation as a demonstration for the development team and publisher. Levels were built in Volition's Core Technology Group (CTG) editor, which was continually built in the four years preceding release. Like the other two titles, \"Saints Row: The Third\" was built in the Havok physics engine with customizations. The engine let the team build vehicle drifting physics and the VTOL aircraft. The studio considered the \"Red Faction\" series' Geo-Mod 2 engine but chose against it due to the implementation's difficulty and not wanting that degree of destruction. Phillips gave a game development postmortem at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, where he advised studios to let development team members run with their ideas. Volition began to add modding support to the title and series in mid 2013.\n\n\"Saints Row: The Third\" has a licensed soundtrack available as radio stations when driving in vehicles. Players can switch between the playlists, which range from classical to electronic to hip-hop, rock, or customize their own station based on their preferences. The original soundtrack was composed by Malcolm Kirby Jr., who had previously worked on \"The Love Guru\" soundtrack. It was released through Sumthing Else Music Works alongside the game via compact disc and digital download. Kirby said the series' over-the-top nature influenced the score, and that he was a huge fan of the series before he received the opportunity. In his composition, each gang has a theme and specific characteristics that range from \"menacing orchestral to gangster hip hop to heavy metal\".\n\n The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 simultaneously on November 15, 2011, in the United States and Australia, and three days later in the United Kingdom. The November 17, 2011, Japan release had the veins removed from the Penetrator weapon (the three-foot long phallus bat) due to regulatory restrictions on depictions of genitalia. In lieu of exclusive game content scheduled for the PlayStation 3 version that did not ship with the game, early North American and European players who purchased that version received a complimentary download code for \"Saints Row 2\". The summer before \"Saints Row: The Third\" release, THQ pledged to support it with a year's worth of downloadable content. Around the time of release, Danny Bilson of THQ announced that \"Saints Row IV\" was already in planning.\n\nThose who preordered the game received Professor Genki's Hyper Ordinary Preorder Pack, which included Genki-themed downloadable content (a costume, a vehicle, and a weapon). A North American limited edition box set release called the Platinum Pack included the preorder content, the soundtrack, and a custom headset. Australia and New Zealand received two limited editions: the Smooth Criminal pack from EB Games and the Maximum Pleasure bundle from JB Hi-Fi, each of which included tie-in items along with the game and preorder content.\n\nThough the game wasn't shown at E3 2010, THQ spoke of extensive tie-in merchandising (collectible card game, books) and a \"Saints Row\" film in production as part of a \"robust transmedia play\". Instead, THQ announced \"Saints Row: Drive By\", a tie-in game for the Nintendo 3DS and Xbox Live Arcade that would unlock content in \"Saints Row 3\". After the game was announced in March 2011, it was featured on the cover of \"Game Informer\" April issue. Closer to release, THQ sent rap group the Broken Pixels a development kit with a pre-release version of the game and asked them to record track about \"all the wacky things\" to do in the game. The group wrote the rap in a day and later produced a YouTube video set to clips from the game. THQ hosted an event in Redfern, Australia where women in skintight clothes pumped free gas for three hours, which generated an estimated 35 times return on investment. \"Eurogamer\" recalled that the game was \"marketed almost exclusively on the basis of all the wacky stuff it will let you do\" from the costumes to the sex toy weapons, and \"Edge\" described \"Saints Row: The Third\" as \"marketed by sex toys and porn stars\".\n\nTwo weeks before the game's release, \"Saints Row: The Third\" had four times the preorder count of \"Saints Row 2\" at its comparable point. By January 2012, the game had shipped 3.8 million units worldwide, which THQ cited as an example for its business model change to focus on the big franchises. THQ President and CEO Brian Farrell expected to ship five to six million copies of the game in its lifetime. It had reached four million by April, and 5.5 million by the end of the year. \"Saints Row: The Third\" was an unexpected continued success for the company. It was featured in promotions with Humble Bundle, PlayStation Plus, and Xbox Live Games with Gold over the next several years.\n\nVolition released a Linux port of the game in 2016, and made the Xbox 360 release compatible with its successor, the Xbox One, the next year. In August 2018, Deep Silver announced a Nintendo Switch port which will be released in 2019.\n\nThe game received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers said the game did not try to be more than a good time, and described it as a variant of \"ridiculous\", \"zany\", or \"absurd\". In another way, others called it \"juvenile\". Critics praised the degree of customization options, and had mixed views of the array of activities, but found Professor Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax a high point. Some found the game's ironic sexism to verge on misogyny, and that its other humor sometimes fell flat. Several critics referred to the game as the perfection of the \"Saints Row\" formula It was a nominee for Best Narrative at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, an IGN Editor's Choice, and a recipient of perfect scores from \"GamesRadar\" and \"G4\".\n\n\"Edge\" said that the series \"wants to be the \"WarioWare\" of open-city games\", \"a cartoon flipbook of anything-goes extremity\" to \"Grand Theft Auto\" \"ostentatious crime drama\". They wrote that the game's \"single-minded\" \"puerile imagination\" demanded respect and noted the game's escalation of video game tropes and cultural references from Japanese game shows to text adventures to zombie apocalypses to lucha libre. IGN's Daemon Hatfield called the game \"an open world adult theme park\". He said that calling it \"a good time would be a severe understatement\" and praised its method of incentivizing almost every action in the game as \"fantastic game design\". Hatfield was \"addicted\" to efficiently expanding his in-game hourly income. \"GamesRadar\" Michael Grimm wrote \"Saints Row: The Third\" was nearly surreal, and praised the player-character's running attacks.\n\nReferring to the historical comparison between the \"Saints Row\" and \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, Dan Whitehead of \"Eurogamer\" wrote that \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" serious turn let the \"Saints Row\" series be a \"gleeful silly sandbox game\", and noted that \"Saints Row: The Third\" was \"marketed almost exclusively\" based on its wackiness, from the costumes to the sex toy weapons. He felt that the \"wacky hijinks\" quickly became \"predictable and repetitive\" and the activities felt \"sanitized and generic\". \"Edge\" wrote that they were \"one-off gags\". \"Eurogamer\" Whitehead added that the tiger escort Guardian Angel missions appeared to draw from Will Ferrell's \"Talladega Nights\", and that the Prof. Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax shooting gallery drew from Bizarre Creations' \"The Club\" shooter. \"Eurogamer\" and \"PC Gamer\" both found the game easy.\n\nRyan McCaffrey of \"Official Xbox Magazine\" thought that the game resolved some of the problems of open world design and thus allowed for an experience with good times and no filler, such as \"Burnout\"-style arrows on the streets instead of hidden in the minimap GPS. He added that this was the game Volition \"was born to make\". Grimm from \"GamesRadar\" similarly praised Volition for their \"<nowiki>http://deckers.die</nowiki>\" mission, which was \"so insanely creative and funny that it single handedly makes the game worth playing\". He added that the game's unrealistic driving made the game more fun. IGN's Hatfield was \"really won ... over\" by his character and both was convinced she cared about her friends and impressed by her voice actress. Whitehead of \"Eurogamer\" found Zimos, the pimp who speaks in Autotune, to be the game's best character. \"Edge\" found some of the writing \"sharp\" and executed well by the voice actors. \"PC Gamer\" Tom Senior found the major story missions to be a highlight. Hatfield of IGN thought the single-player game fell apart at the end and called the two endings either \"a super downer\" or nonsense. He found the cooperative mode easy to set up, but felt like the game's missions were not designed well for multiple players, and that the visiting player became a \"third wheel\". On the other hand, CBS News's Christina Santiago called the cooperative mode \"near perfect\" and exemplary.\n\nIGN's Hatfield considered the game's graphics average for the age. He \"loved the neon-lit towering skyscrapers of Steelport\" but thought the streets were sometimes \"lifeless\", as the game may be \"open world\" but not a \"living world\". \"Edge\" added that the city was easy enough to navigate, but that it was missing character. Grimm of \"GamesRadar\" said it didn't look bad, but wasn't interesting. Multiple reviewers complained of \"pop-in\", or of graphical errors. \"1UP.com\" reported the PC version's graphics to be more stable, and \"Eurogamer\" Digital Foundry face-off recommended the PlayStation 3 release for its lack of screen tearing.\n\n\"Eurogamer\" Whitehead felt that the game crept closer \"from ironic sexism to outright misogyny\" in missions such as \"Trojan Whores\" and set pieces like \"Tits n' Grits\" and \"Stikit Inn\", even in the series' \"gloriously lowbrow standards\". \"Edge\" added that intent of humor in the sex trafficking-related mission \"The Ho Boat\" did not come across well, and seemed to be included only for shock value. Hatfield of IGN related that some of the game's more juvenile aspects made him cringe, and \"Edge\" wrote that the game felt \"largely meaningless\" in response to the desensitizing barrage of \"context-free frippery\". \"PC Gamer\" Tom Senior said he was almost offended during much of the game but stayed more happy than disgusted, adding that while the game has a \"huge purple dildo\", it doesn't have the prostitute-killing liberties or \"other moments of nastiness\" associated with the \"Grand Theft Auto\" franchise.\n\nWhitehead of \"Eurogamer\" wrote in conclusion that the game doesn't propose \"anything particularly inventive\" and instead ends up with a toy box of gadgets. \"Edge\" felt that the game was weakest where it leaned on \"Grand Theft Auto\" precedent without adding a social commentary. \"Eurogamer\" Whitehead added that \"Saints Row: The Third\" missed an opportunity to separate from \"the \"GTA\" formula\", which \"Edge\" thought was done well in the last third of the game. IGN, however, felt the game was explicitly not a \"Grand Theft Auto\" clone, and \"G4\" called it \"a knockoff no more\".\n\nDuring an interview on the future of THQ in June 2012, its president, Jason Rubin, responded to the interviewer's concerns that \"Saints Row: The Third\" was not a game he wanted to play in front of his family by saying that, while he does not consider there to be no place in the company \"for a game that features a purple dildo\", Volition chose that route because of the limited options and their \"environment at the time\", and he was looking to push the publisher and its studios to do better.\n\n has included additional story missions, weapons, and characters. A \"definitive edition\", \"Saints Row: The Third – The Full Package\", contains all post-release downloadable content—including all three mission packs (\"Genkibowl VII\", \"Gangstas in Space\", and \"The Trouble with Clones\") and bonus items (clothes, vehicles, and weapons)—in addition to the main game. \"The Full Package\" was announced in September 2012 for release two months later on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.\n\nTHQ announced an \"Enter the Dominatrix\" standalone expansion as an April Fool's joke in 2012. It was confirmed as in development the next month. In \"Enter the Dominatrix\", the alien commander Zinyak imprisons the Saints' leader in a simulation of Steelport called The Dominatrix so as to prevent interference when he takes over the planet. The expansion also added superpowers for the player-character. In June, THQ said the expansion would be wrapped into a full sequel, tentatively titled \"The Next Great Sequel in the \"Saints Row\" Franchise\" and scheduled for a 2013 release. Parts of \"Enter the Dominatrix\" that weren't incorporated into the sequel, \"Saints Row IV\", were later released as downloadable content for the new title, under the same name.\n\n\n"}

It was originally broadcast at 666 kHz, later at 93.6 MHz FM, and still later carried on Kosmos 93.6). The station program focused at the outset on Greek music but also on theater performances.

Specifically, NERIT was closed and ERT reopened with all the radios including the Second Programme. So the day started the relaunch, the station transmits again the ERT and the HR.\n"}

Musician's Guide to Polyrhythms Vol. I was written in 1967 and published in 1968. Musician;s Guide to Polyrhythms Vol. II was written in 1970 and published in 1971 and was (at the time) a continuation of Vol. l. The first publisher (Try Publishing, Hollywood, Ca.) published both volumes separately. These volumes have since been combined into one single volume called Polyrhythms: The Musicians Guide and is now published by Hal Leonard Publishing Corporation.\n\nBoth books were written after Peter had studied with North Indian Tabla Drum Master, Mahapurush Misra, who was teaching and playing with Usted Ali Akbar Khan in a summer program of North Indian Classical Music at the University of California, Berkeley campus in 1966. Realizing the need for a pedagogical system of study for musicians using the “western” system of notation; Magadini re-configured the concepts and coined the phrase “time ratios”, which describes the mathematical ratios of polymeters as they relate to each other. Magadini also introduced in these volumes a new way to write “Polyrhythmic Time Signatures”. Both volumes deal with polymeters and polyrhythms, and are presented, in a step-by-step manner, through exercises and etudes that progress from easy to difficult.\n\nGunther Schuller of the New England Conservatory called \"Musicians Guide to Polyrhythms\" \"... a very important contribution\".\n\nIn 1993, \"Modern Drummer Magazine\" ranked \"Polyrhythms The Musician's Guide\" as #6 in its survey of \"the 25 Greatest Drum books\".\n\nA review in the Percussion Arts Society's \"Percussion Notes\" lauded the book's organization and the \"articulate and easily understood\" explanations of the various polyrhythms.\n\nAnother polyrhythm book by Magadini was written exclusively for drumset drummers titled Polyrhythms For The Drumset (originally published in 1973) . It is currently published by Alfred Publishing. It also presents polyrhythms and polymeters in step-by-step exercises and etudes. However, the polyrhythms are distributed between hands and feet at the drumset in independent combinations between the ride cymbal, the snare drum, the bass drum and hi hat. This book also describes and contains exercises that teach drummers how to play and perform metric modulation.\nPolyrhythms For The Drumset endorsers include: Vic Firth, Steve Smith, Cindy Blackman, Peter Erskin, Roy Burns, Jim Chapin, Chad Wackerman, Anthony Cirone, Louie Bellson, William F.

{"id": "15283826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15283826", "title": "The Way That I Love You", "text": "The Way That I Love You\n\n\"The Way That I Love You\" is a song recorded by American singer Ashanti from her fourth studio album, \"The Declaration\" (2008). It was released as the album's lead single on February 26, 2008, through Universal and The Inc.. Ashanti wrote and produced the song with L.T. Hutton. Backed by a piano, a guitar, and horns, \"The Way That I Love You\" is a midtempo R&B ballad with lyrics about betrayal. Critical response was primarily positive; some reviewers cited it as a highlight from \"The Declaration\", while others felt it was inferior to music released by Beyoncé and Mary J. Blige. Commercially, the song peaked at number 37 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, and appeared on the publication's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Adult R&B Songs component charts.\n\nKevin Bray directed the single's music video, which shows Ashanti murdering her boyfriend after discovering his infidelity. It was inspired by the true crime shows \"Snapped\" and \"Forensic Files\". The video's emphasis on violence attracted critical attention. As part of the song's promotion, Ashanti opened a website that allowed one to create and send a personalized news report and a death threat to a contact. The campaign received a negative response for its violent theme, including being the subject of a Los Angeles protest, and was ultimately taken down. Ashanti performed \"The Way That I Love You\" at the Sessions@AOL, as well as on tours.\n\nL.T. Hutton and Ashanti wrote and produced \"The Way That I Love You\" for her fourth studio album, \"The Declaration\" (2008). Ashanti was inspired to wrote the song after hearing its opening instrumental, an explained: \"I just started jotting down words, and it just kind of poured out.\" She produced the vocals, while Hutton programmed and played the instruments. \n\nUniversal and The Inc. released The Way That I Love You\" as the album's lead single, sending it to urban radio on February 26, 2008, and rhythmic radio on April 1, 2008. Prior to the song's release, Switch\", featuring Nelly, and \"Hey Baby (After the Club)\" had been announced as the first single before being replaced by \"The Way That I Love You\". In July 2008, it was included on a Cartier charity playlist, which was created to support the Boys & Girls Clubs of America organization.\n\nA midtempo R&B ballad, \"The Way That I Love You\" lasts 4 minutes and 30 seconds. It is composed in the key of E minor using common time and a \"moderate hip-hop\" tempo. The instrumentation is provided by a piano, a guitar, and horns; Sal Cinquemani of \"Slant Magazine\" wrote that the single is \"driven by a distinct descending piano arpeggio and horn arrangement\". Ashanti's vocal range spans from the low note of D to the high note of E. AllMusic's Andy Kellman compared her vocals to her 2003 single \"Rain on Me\" due to the similar \"melodramatic flourishes\". Regarding the lyrics, however, Kellman wrote that \"The Way That I Love You\" is \"much more vengeful in nature than depressive\" than \"Rain on Me\". The single is about issues of betrayal, which Ashanti felt was relatable to men and women.\n\nThe critical response was largely positive, with reviewers identifying it as an album highlight. The \"New York Daily News\"' Jim Farber praised Ashanti's collaborations with Hutton as \"[her] best material\". However, the single received negative comparisons to music released by other artists. Despite her positive review for Ashanti's emotion on \"The Way That I Love You\", Leah Greenblatt of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that it was inferior to songs by Beyoncé and Mary J. Blige. \"Vibe\"'s Shanel Odum dismissed the song as \"barely set[ting] off a smoke detector, let alone ring[ing] any alarms\", in a reference to Beyoncé's 2006 single \"Ring the Alarm\".\n\nCommercially, \"The Way That I Love You\" peaked at number 37 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart on May 17, 2008, and remained on the chart for 18 weeks. It reached number two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number 18 on the Adult R&B Songs component charts compiled by the same publication.\n\nKevin Bray directed the single's accompanying music video, which was uploaded on Ashanti's YouTube account on December 22, 2009. A rough cut had leaked a few weeks before its premiere in February 2008. Another version of the video, with the subtitle \"Access Denied\", was released on Ashanti's YouTube account on on November 22, 2009. Ashanti used the true crime shows \"Snapped\" and \"Forensic Files\" as the primary inspirations for the video. She felt that the storyline of a woman driven to murder fit the single's dramatic, painful and emotional lyrics, and described the video as \"very cinematic as opposed to a regular music video\". When discussing the overall message, Ashanti said: \"Don't cheat.\" \n\nThroughout the video, Ashanti is shown in a volatile relationship with her boyfriend, played by actor Christian Keyes. After learning about his infidelity, the singer is seen posing with a butcher's knife while wearing an evening gown. Images of evidence, including a bloody knife, footprints, and walls, are intercut throughout the video. It ends with Ashanti leaving her partner, after stabbing him in a bathtub. The video received critical commentary for its portrayal of violence. In a 2015 article, Spencer Kornhaber of \"The Atlantic\" cited it as an example of violence conducted by women in music videos. Kornbaber described the trend as \"pop singers joyfully and brutally sidestepping tropes about victimhood\". A contributor for \"The Boombox\" summarized the video with the saying: \"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\"\n\nA publicity stunt was coordinated with the music video's release through Ashanti's website (TheWayThatILoveYou.com), in which one could create and send a personalized news report and a death threat to a contact. The message, stylized as a \"gotcha-gram\", featured a customized video about a series of murders inspired by \"The Way That I Love You\" and the then-upcoming release of \"The Declaration\". The message can be customized to include the victim's name and crime, the murder weapon, and the sender's name and home state. The choices for \"crimes\" are \"sleeping around\", \"suspected sleeping around\", \"playing you like a fool\", and \"breaking your heart.\" The weapons include a boot, knife, can, sledgehammer, rolling pin, and a guillotine. It also included a disclaimer: \"Ashanti and Universal Music Group do not encourage or condone violence of any kind. This is for parody purposes only.\" Each message was attributed to the fictional Universal Crime Network. An example of a \"gotcha-gram\", sent to CNN's Lola Ogunnaike, was: \"Do you know the person pictured in the following video. If so, please contact me immediately. Your life might be in danger.\" \n\nThe campaign received a primarily negative response. The civil rights organization Project Islamic Hope and the think tank Industry Ears led a protest in Los Angeles that called for the website's removal. These groups felt that the project encouraged violence as a valid means to handle disputes. Ogunnaike deemed the messages \"disturbing\", and felt that it damaged Ashanti's public image as a \"good girl\". Universal closed the site, but Ashanti defended it as \"a better alternative to actual violence\" and \"an incredible online viral tool\". Ashanti's publicist Michelle Huff clarified that the video was intended to have a similar tone to a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch, and said that the singer had received primarily positive feedback for the site.\n\nAshanti promoted \"The Way That I Love You\" with a live performance in a 2008 Sessions@AOL. In 2016, she sang it as part of the Natural Born Hitters Tour with rapper Ja Rule. \"The Boombox\"'s Liz Ramanand cited the performance as a highlight from the show. Ashanti subsequently included it on the setlist for a 2018 tour with Ja Rule. Victor D. Infante of \"Telegram & Gazette\" praised her for providing a \"soulful rendition\" of the single and her decision to provide \"an air of vulnerability\" by singing it without backup dancers.\n\n"}

His father, of Cornish descent, was a timber and iron merchant who served as mayor of Broken Hill in 1890, having previously lived in Port Pirie. He moved to Western Australia in 1895, following the gold rushes, where he set up as a supplier of building materials, and subsequently served as mayor of the South Perth Municipality from 1906 to 1907. His son was educated at Caterer's School, Norwood; Hahndorf College, Hahndorf; and Prince Alfred College, Adelaide. He moved with his family to Perth, where he established himself as an importer of sporting goods. Coombe played cricket for the Claremont-Cottesloe Cricket Club, and also represented the Western Australia against a number of touring sides from the eastern states. His only first-class match was against South Australia at the WACA Ground in January 1906. Batting at number five in both innings, he was caught and bowled for a duck in the first innings by Algy Gehrs, and made 15 in the second innings before being caught off the bowling of Pat Travers. Coombe later served as umpire in a single first-class match when South Australia toured at the end of the 1908–09 season.\n\nIn 1910, Coombe formed a partnership with Thomas James West, a British cinema exhibitor who owned the largest cinema circuit in Australia. In 1913, he became local managing director of Union Cinemas, formed from the merger of West's company and a competitor. Coombe financed the construction of several large cinemas in Perth and Fremantle, including the Prince of Wales Theatre on Murray Street, the Ambassadors Theatre on Hay Street, and the Princess Theatre in Fremantle. Coombe also served as president of the Theatre Managers' Association from 1921 to 1928. In 1928, he retired from a managerial role but continued as a director of Union Cinemas. Coombe was also a noted philanthropist. In his role in the Theatre Managers' Association, he raised large sums of money for various causes, and also chaired the Boy Scouts Association of Western Australia. In 1921, he established the Coombe Scholarships, with a ₤5000 donation. Coombe was a made a knight during a visit to England in June 1924, \"in recognition of his public services\". However, in 1931, he was prosecuted and found guilty of income tax evasion, and fined ₤100. After Union Cinemas collapsed the same year, Coombe was forced to sell much of his property, although his sons remained in the cinema business. He later moved to Glenelg, a suburb of Adelaide, and then to Surrey in England, where he died in 1959.\n\n"}

On the surrounding site, in 1922, even before the completion of the studios, the film \"Samson und Delila\" was produced, an epic on the then very popular American model. With extravagant sets and costumes, as generally used by Vita-Film's direct competitor, Sascha-Film, the production lasted a considerable time and cost 12 million Austrian crowns.\n\n\"Samson und Delila\" was not however a typical Vita-Film production. Unlike Sascha-Film, which took its lead from American productions, Vita-Film sought international success by following French models. In 1923 directors employed on specific projects included Germaine Dulac (\"Die sterbende Sonne\", 1923), Jean Legrand (\"Das Haus im Walde\", 1923), Severin Mars (\"Horoga\", 1923), M. Liabel (\"Die Insel ohne Liebe\", 1923) and Edouard-Emile Violet (\"Clown aus Liebe\", 1923). The Belgian director and one of the earliest realists, Jacques Feyder, filmed \"Das Bildnis\" in 1924 in Rosenhügel and Hungary, based on a screenplay by the well-known author Jules Romains. The film, the last Vita-Film production, was released in 1925.\n\nThe company went bankrupt in 1924, like many other European film companies at this time, because of the flood of low-priced but technically high-quality productions from the United States. The Rosenhügel studios were taken over in 1933 by Sascha-Film.\n\n"}
