To explore this idea, he worldbuilt a universe with two places: the spirit plane (the source of magic) and the mundane plane (where mortals live). Once a person discovers their magical true name, they are able to unite their spirit and mundane forms, thereby unlocking unlimited power.\n\n\"Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage\" follows a young squire named Alaron who, while searching for a missing farmer named Kendall, encounters a strange spirit and is poisoned by Goblins. He awakes from a terrifying vision of monsters to find himself inside the hut of Oriana, a healer, who tells Alaron that the poison is beyond the powers of normal medicine to cure. Upon returning to Castle Gwernia, the king, Phelan, instructs him to ask the Mirari people of Erromon to help heal his poison. Upon reaching Erromon, the Mirari King, Txomin, explains that they've been under attack from goblins and seeks Alaron's aid, promising to direct him to a naming wizard named Cradawgh.\n\nAlaron clears the goblins off the mountains, however when he returns to Erromon he discovers that Txomin lied, and does not know the whereabouts of Cradawgh, telling Alaron instead to travel to Talewok, and see the sorceress, Ardra. Before leaving, Alaron converses with the Mirari queen Yeraza, who gives him the Stormbreaker, a blessed tree branch able to calm any storm.\n\nAt the Wizard School, the doorman asks everyone's True Name, but Alaron cannot answer. Ardra the sorceress begins the healing spell, which brings on another vision. This one includes a feeble, old man in a rocking chair. Ardra explains that the healing spell failed because Alaron is a Wildling – he has no True Name. Without a True Name, his spirit is not bound to his body, and Alaron is incomplete. Ardra tells him to travel to Port Saiid and take a boat to Cradawgh's Island.\n\nAlaron is eventually able to hire a boat at Port Saiid – after an unusual encounter with a cryptic jester but the ship travels into a powerful storm, and as the Stormbreaker is tied to the mast instead of the helm, the ship is damaged and forced to land at Chaos Isle. Following repairs the party sets off for Cradawgh's Island; this time the ship arrives safely, however a group of monsters has already reached Cradawgh. The dying wizard asks Alaron to bring his body to Talewok, and suggests seeking the Jundar King Zaratas in the desert.\n\nAfter Cradawgh's funeral in Talewok, Alaron heads down to the city of Terminor. He then soon discovers that the nearby village of Pome was destroyed by a wizard with a twisted staff. The final level of Terminor has a house, in which resides Mago, a wizard without a True Name, who went insane several years ago and called up a huge storm when the townspeople tried to kill him. Mago is the feeble, old man from Alaron's earlier vision and can no longer speak.\n\nAlaron travels to a nearby bog, where he finds the Tower of Shamsuk, a powerful necromancer who had previously destroyed Pome and cursed Niesen, slowly turning him into a zombie. Niesen gets the party into the tower where they eventually reach a chamber with a large stone hand. The jester from Port Saiid appears once more, revealing himself to be Farris – a wizard. Farris joins the party, assisting them in defeating Shamsuk, who has already killed Oriana – now revealed to be Alaron's mother. Farris then leaves the party, taking Shamsuk's necromantic staff with him.\n\nAlaron crosses a desert to reach the Jundar city of Ugarit, where he speaks with the Jundar Emperor, Zaratas, who explains that only the dragon Rooughah can name Alaron. He needs to find the Golden Horn of Kynon and play it for Rooughah. Alaron retrieves the Horn, and begins heading back to Erromon.\n\nAlaron travels through the Erromon tunnels until he comes across the dragon Rooughah. After Alaron plays the Horn of Kynon, Rooughah tells him he knows his True Name: \"Alaron\". The Mirari then tell Alaron that the forces of Chaos are gathering outside Gwernia. Alaron returns to Gwernia castle and fights his way to Prince Sheridan, who confesses to always being jealous of Alaron. Sheridan explains that Alaron is the son of Oriana and King Phelan. Alaron fights and kills Sheridan, only to then meet Pochangarat (the leader of Chaos) – the huge monster from Alaron's first vision in Oriana's hut.\n\nAfter Pochangarat's death, Alaron finds his father, King Phelan, who is dying from the wounds he suffered at Pochangarat's hands. He requests to be buried under the Great Wall of Knights in Gwernia, and appoints Alaron as his successor before dying. The story ends with Alaron's coronation ceremony.\n\nIn a preview, Daily Radar noted the game's potential as the \"defining RPG for the Nintendo 64\".\n\nAidyn received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics, scoring a 53 on Metacritic. And a negative 47.36% on Game Rankings. In their review, IGN gave the game a 4.2/10 stating, \"The scope of it was too large and led to a really -- and I mean really -- tedious experience. It has no way of pulling you into the story or gameplay.\"\n"}

{"id": "9096145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9096145", "title": "Bridge to the Sun", "text": "Bridge to the Sun\n\nBridge to the Sun is a 1961 film, directed by Etienne Périer, starring Carroll Baker, James Shigeta, James Yagi, Tetsurō Tamba, and Sean Garrison. It is based on the 1957 autobiography \"Bridge To The Sun\" by Gwen Terasaki, which detailed events in Gwen's life and marriage.\n\nGwen Harold, an American woman from Tennessee, meets Hidenari Terasaki (called Terry by his friends and family), the secretary to the Japanese Ambassador, while attending a reception at the Japanese Embassy in Washington D.C. with her Aunt Peggy and friend Bill. They share a moment while Terry is showing her the antique Japanese artworks on display in the Embassy, and after some reluctance, she agrees to allow him to call on her.\n\nThey begin dating and they quickly fall in love, even though Terry occasionally has fits of anti-western sentiment. When Terry asks her to marry him, she agrees, much to the chagrin of Aunt Peggy (who was raised in the Jim Crow South), and who sees the relationship as unnatural, especially when there are \"nice clean young men\" available. The Japanese Ambassador also calls on Gwen and attempts to dissuade her from accepting, claiming it would hurt Terry's career by giving him an American bias, and states that even though the two countries are friendly, anything could happen between foreign countries. He seems to hint at possible aggression in the future, even though it is only 1935 and the Japanese have not yet resumed conflicts with China, keeping the countries of Gwen and Terry at an uneasy peace. They eventually marry despite the obstacles and, when Terry is recalled, travel to Japan by ship.\n\nAlmost immediately after disembarking and arriving in Tokyo, Terry begins to treat Gwen much differently, expecting her to behave according to the male-centric beliefs of contemporary Japan, such as being silent among men, always entering doors after the men, and virtually bending to every whim of Terry and her male relatives. They continually fight and make up, mostly because of Gwen's outspokenness among men and Terry's strict adherence to the local customs.\n\nAfter having a fight one night over a general saying that Terry should be proud he may have a son to die for the Emperor, and Gwen speaking out about his distasteful comment, they make up and she reveals that she was so offended by the comment because she is pregnant. The baby daughter is named Mako.\n\nBy November 1941 Terry has been reassigned to the Embassy in America. They have Thanksgiving dinner in Washington with Aunt Peggy, as World War II embroils the world around them and America is one of the few powers of the world still at peace. Terry speaks on the phone with his friend Haro. He mentions that Mako, now about 5 years old, has an apparent illness involving too many antibodies in her blood. He also mentions a possible upcoming invasion of Thailand by the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\nSensing that it may be the last chance for peace between America and the Empire of Japan, Terry attempts to go over the heads of his superiors and have a cable sent directly to President Roosevelt, alerting him to cable the Emperor to seek to preserve the peace. However, the Emperor is rapidly becoming the leader of Japan in name only, because of a power struggle with the army leaders. Terry's effort is in vain as December 7th comes and war is declared shortly after the Japanese attack.\n\nTerry calls Gwen after hearing of the attack and tells her to leave Washington for Tennessee with Mako, but the FBI enter and force her to hang up the phone. She decides to accompany Terry back to Japan, as he is due to be deported in an Ambassador exchange, and there is nearly a riot as she leaves with the other Japanese families, because of anti-Japanese fervor sweeping the nation in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, The Philippines, and other European and American held colonies and bases in the Pacific and Asia.\n\nIn Japan, a similar nationalist, anti-American hatred, is shown among the citizens. Terry, however, is less enthusiastic about the war, and attempts to be a mediator for peace, which is dangerous due to sentiment and secret police. Gwen is briefly accosted by a group of soldiers, who try and force her to walk on an American flag. She refuses and an air raid begins, causing panic in the streets as bombs begin to destroy the area. She sees a crying child and remembering her daughter, runs to the smoldering school to rescue Mako, who says that children had hit her and called her an American.\n\nLater, Terry reveals that he is under suspicion for being disloyal, because he has an American wife, does not belong to any patriotic clubs, and speaks out against the war. Soldiers enter and search the house, and while they don't arrest him, it is clear that he and his family are going to have a rough time as long as they stay in Tokyo. They agree to stay at a friend's empty house outside of the city.\n\nAs they leave Tokyo, they run into Terry's cousin, Ishi, who has been one of the few people who has been kind to Gwen. Now a soldier, he informs them that he is captain in a Kamikaze squadron, and will soon \"die for a descendent of the sun-god\". While taking a train, Gwen sees captured American soldiers, possibly on a death march. They arrive at their new home and meet the young girl who lives there. Terry reveals that he is going back to Tokyo, and didn't tell her earlier because she would not have gone to stay without him. He offers to arrange her passage back to America, but she refuses, wanting to be close to her husband.\n\nAs the war continues, food shortages and widespread damage make it clear that things are going against Japan. As the years go on, Terry visits less and less, and Mako grows not knowing any other existence besides one of perpetual war. Terry returns after months and they enjoy a night's sleep together. They awaken to a visit from a military police officer, who is looking for Terry. As the war continues to turn against them, they begin to suspect disloyalty from anyone critical of the government. Gwen manages to convince them that she has not seen Terry, and they leave. Terry reveals that he has brought a radio, and an American news station announces the end of the Battle of Iwo Jima, which will be used as a base to launch bombers against mainland Japan. Later on, the surrender of Nazi Germany, Japan's main ally, is also announced, and it is clear that the invasion of Japan is coming soon.\n\nTerry and Gwen have a fight one night because he gave away the last of their food. Gwen goes to the village to get her hair done to please her husband and on her way home she allows Mako to play in the village but then a squadron of American bombers and fighters attack. The couple rush to find her, and amid the devastation of the village, they find Mako, alive and unhurt. Her close friend, however, has been hit and died instantly. At the burial, Gwen comments on Mako's jaded reaction, showing no tears or emotion for her friend, because of Japanese customs, as well as growing up during a war.\n\nOne night Gwen visits Terry's old friend Hara, who has some power within the party, pleading for him to keep her husband safe. He introduces her to Tokyo Rose, a radio propaganda announcer who tries to hurt the moral of enemy armies listening to her broadcasts. They agree to help Terry, but only if Gwen makes an anti-American speech on the radio, recognizing the propaganda value of an actual American denouncing her country. Gwen refuses, and learns that Ishi has been fatally injured and is in the hospital. She visits, and realizing he is dying asks why he sent his wife away at this time. He reveals that it is tradition that he not want his loved ones to see him die. She returns home in time to see Terry, who had been hiding in the hills to avoid arrest, return.\n\nThe next day, the entire village arrives at their house, being the only one with a radio, for the Emperor's radio address. The Emperor has never spoken in public before, so they realize he must have major news, possibly surrender. As the village listens to the Emperor's voice for the first time, the speech starts:\n\nWith the war over, Terry asks Gwen to return to her home of Johnson City, Tennessee, to put Mako in an American school while she is young and can lose her prejudices against America, to \"become a bridge between the two nations\". At that time Gwen vehemently refuses to leave him. Later on, she finds Terry, who has been overworked, malnourished, and ill for many months, standing over his parents' graves. She recalls a speech he once gave her about visiting the graves of ancestors at times of marriage, birth and death. She also recalls the conversation with Ishi at the hospital before his death when he said he didn't want his wife to see him die. She speaks to Terry's doctor and learns that he has at most, months to live, and was trying to send his family away because, like his cousin, he didn't want them to see him die.\n\nDays later, after Gwen agrees to his final wish to leave for America, Terry sees her and Mako off at the dock. They kiss and embrace for the last time, and Gwen reassures him that they'll be expecting him soon, knowing she will never see him again. She holds her composure until he is out of sight, then breaks down and begins crying.\n\nAs the ship departs, Terry walks down the dock, keeping pace with it until he can go no farther. The film ends with Gwen and Terry lovingly meeting each other's gaze for a final time.\n\n\nThe memoir narrates the life of Gwen Harold (an American from Tennessee (1906–1990)), who in 1931 married Hidenari \"Terry\" Terasaki (b.1900), a Japanese diplomat. He was First Secretary at the Japanese Embassy in Washington, D.C. in 1941 when Pearl Harbor was bombed, was one of the staff who helped translate the Japanese declaration of war and delivered it (late) to the U.S. government and (Mrs. Terasaki wrote in her memoirs) earlier sent secret messages to Japanese pacifists seeking to avert war. The couple and their daughter Mariko were like all Axis diplomats interned in 1942 and repatriated via neutral Angola later that year. Terasaki held various posts in the Japanese Foreign Affairs department up to 1945 when he became an advisor to the Emperor, and was the official liaison between the Palace and General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Allied Commander.\n\nMariko and her mother left Japan in 1949 so Mariko could attend college in Tennessee. Terry died in 1951 in Japan; he was 50 years old.\n\nDuring the scene in which the Japanese Ambassador to America tries to persuade Gwen to call off the marriage, he seems to hint at a possible conflict between the two countries. It is unlikely that he was aware of any definitive war aims, however, as being 1935, Japan was still at peace with China. Soon after, they would declare war and, in protest to their actions, the United States would issue an oil embargo against Japan, escalating the disagreement between the two and paving the way for war.\n\nThe speech that Hirohito gives on the radio at the end of the film is a part of the actual recording of the speech that was played to announce plans of surrender. Terry's translation for Gwen, however, is actually only bits and pieces of the much longer speech, even though it sounds as though he is translating it word for word.\n\n"}

In each episode he interviews a guest while giving them a lift in an eco-friendly car (normally a Toyota Prius hybrid electric vehicle). The guests are often well-known British television personalities such as Jonathan Ross or Ade Edmondson. However, Llewellyn also interviews less-well-known figures as long as he feels that they will prove to be an interesting subject. The guests also included Llewellyn's fellow \"Red Dwarf\" actors, Danny John Jules, Craig Charles, Chris Barrie and Hattie Hayridge (as well as Tony Hawks, Arthur Smith and Ruby Wax who all appeared in cameo roles in \"Red Dwarf\", while Ed Bye, the show's producer/director, was the first person interviewed for the series). Llewellyn has also reunited with his \"Scrapheap Challenge\" co-hosts, Cathy Rogers and Lisa Rogers for interviews.\n\nThe show was filmed using small cameras mounted within the car. Llewellyn drives his guest to a destination of their choosing as they talk informally about a variety of subjects. As Llewellyn is driving for the majority of the time, it can be difficult to deal with technical problems especially interference from mobile phones. Occasionally, as in the Lisa Rogers episode, outside events such as being stopped by police interrupt the discussions.\n\nThe TV show, based on the web format, has been developed by RDF. Funded and sponsored by Toyota, Carpool was first broadcast on Dave on 4 November 2010.\nThe deal was planned by ZenithOptimedia, a leading media agency, and the deal brokered by newcast, the Branded Entertainment Division of ZenithOptimedia.

{"id": "6370548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6370548", "title": "Cinema of Finland", "text": "Cinema of Finland\n\nThe Finnish cinema has a long history, with the first public screenings starting almost as early as modern motion picture technology was invented (the first screening in the world was in 1895, in Finland in 1896). It took over a decade before the first Finnish film was produced and screened in 1907. After these first steps of Finnish cinema, the progress was very slow. After 1907 there were two periods (1909–1911 and 1917–1918) when no Finnish films were produced. This was partly caused by the political situation, as Finland held a status as an autonomous part of Russia and was thus influenced by the worldwide political situation.\n\nIn 1917 Finland became an independent country and in 1918 there was a civil war. After the political situation had settled and stabilized, Finnish society and its cultural life began to develop. This was very clear with cinematic arts. More films were produced and they became an important part of Finnish society. The culmination of this development came soon after the silent era, around the 1940s and 1950s, when three major studios were producing films and competing for the market. When society changed in the 1960s, partly because of political trends and partly because of new forms of entertainment, like television, the appeal of films was threatened, practically all studios were closed, and films became political and too artistic for the masses, as commercial production was considered a thing of the past and distasteful. Few filmmakers were opposed to this development, and kept producing popular films that were bashed by the critics but loved by the people.\n\nA revival in Finnish cinema came in the 1990s, which was partly influenced by the new generation of filmmakers bringing in new ideas, and partly because commercial success was no longer considered to be \"non-artistic,\" thus commercial film projects started to receive support from governmental funds. In the 2000s the Finnish cinema is alive and well, with some films and filmmakers gaining global success and many films receiving a good response from audiences and critics. Today, around 15–20 Finnish full-length feature films are produced every year, and the Finnish cinema is gaining new forms from global influence, such as action and wuxia.\n\nThe majority of Finnish movie theaters are owned by the company Finnkino.\n\nThe Lumière company screened the first moving images at Helsinki in 1896, but it wasn't until 1904 that the first films were actually filmed in Finland. It is unknown who made the first film (called \"Novelty from Helsinki: School youth at break\"), but it was shown by American Bioscope in December. The first Finnish film company, Atelier Apollo, was founded in 1906 by engineer K. E. Ståhlberg. It produced mainly documentary shorts, but also the first Finnish feature film, \"The Moonshiners\" (1907). From the very beginning, Finnish film production was centered to the country's capital, although for few years starting from 1907 there was a noteworthy company Oy Maat ja Kansat producing short documentaries in Tampere.\n\n\"The Moonshiners\" was directed by Teuvo Puro, who was also in charge of directing the first full-length Finnish feature, \"Sylvi\", based on a play by Minna Canth. The film was shot in 1911 with two other full-length literature adaptations, but it didn't premiere until 1913. The filmmakers didn't have enough money to send films to the nearest laboratory in Copenhagen at once, so the material remained undeveloped too long, and two out of three films were ruined.\n\nThe years following \"Sylvi\" saw the formation of the first active feature film company, Hjalmar V. Pohjanheimo's Lyyra-Filmi, which produced both short farces and \"art films\". There was also an attempt to create larger-scale film production by Erik Estlander, who build a studio with glass walls and roof in Helsinki in 1916. At the end of the same year the Russian officials forbid all filming activity in Finland, so nothing much was made anymore before the country's independence in 1917.\n\nThe Finnish film industry of the first two decades of the 20th century was never even near the creativity or the productiveness of its Scandinavian neighbours, Sweden and Denmark – one might even say that it there was barely no industry or production at all. In addition, most of the footage filmed before independence is lost. Of feature films, only thirteen minutes of \"Sylvi\" still remains.\n\nIt wasn't until the 1920s before regular film production started, thanks to a successful company called Suomi-Filmi (founded under the name Suomen Filmikuvaamo in 1919) and its creative leader Erkki Karu. He also directed the most important films of the era and was the prime figure of Finnish cinema before his early death in 1935. His \"The Village Shoemakers\" (1923) is the essential silent masterpiece, a freshly told folk comedy after Aleksis Kivi's play with mildly experimental camerawork by German Kurt Jäger. Other notable films by Karu include: \"The Logroller's Bride\" (1923), with superb cinematography by Jäger and Oscar Lindelöf, and also the first Finnish film distributed widely abroad; \"When Father Has Toothache\" (1923), a short and surrealistic farce; and \"Our Boys\" (1929), a patriotisic forerunner of many military farces.\n\nAudiences of the agricultural country were affected by Suomi-Filmi's rural subjects. Dealing with deeply national countryside stories remained as company's policy through the silent era. Occasionally there were some attempts to make more urban, or more \"European\" films like Karu's \"Summery Fairytale\" (1925), but the public stayed away.\n\nAnother important director at Suomi-Filmi was the aforementioned Puro, who made the company's first feature \"Olli's Years of Apprenticeship\"(1920) and one of the few Finnish horror films, \"Evil Spells\" (1927). An interesting oddity of the last two silent years was Carl von Haartman, a soldier and an adventurer, who had worked as a military advisor in Hollywood. Because of this he was considered capable of directing films. His two upper-class spy dramas, \"The Supreme Victory\" (1929) and \"Mirage\" (1930), were quite passable, but didn't attract the public.\n\nSuomi-Filmi heavily dominated the Finnish film production in the 1920s. The company produced 23 out of 37 full-length feature films made between 1919-1930. Other companies (that appeared occasionally) seemed to vanish from Suomi-Filmi's and Erkki Karu's way after producing one or two films. The most important of these alternative production companies appeared during the latter half of the decade.\n\nThe German cinematographer Jäger left Suomi-Filmi, and formed his own company Komedia-Filmi. It linked with a global film trust (Ufanamet), which at the time possessed most of the film distribution of Finland, thus being a great threat to Suomi-Filmi. Suomi-Filmi defended itself with national values, accusing Komedia-Filmi and Ufanamet for being foreign invaders. Luckily for Suomi-Filmi, both companies proved to be unsuccessful. Komedia-Filmi only made two films, of which the latter one, \"On the Highway of Life\" (1927, directed by Jäger and Ragnar Hartwall) is an interesting attempt to make some kind of a modern comedy.\n\nThe year 1929 saw the premiere of the first two films produced by a minor company Fennica and directed by Valentin Vaala, who was yet to come one of the greatest directors of the golden years of Finnish cinema. When he started making the first one of these (\"Dark Eyes\") he was only 17 years old, and his leading actor Theodor Tugai (later Teuvo Tulio) 14 years old. This film and its instant remake \"The Gypsy Charmer\" were new kind, passionate dramas with clearly oriental influences. Unfortunately only the latter one has remained; the filmmakers destroyed the only negative of \"Dark Eyes\" by throwing it to the sea, because they thought the remake was far superior.\n\nThere were also enterprises to produce films outside the capital, but at least the films made in Viipuri and Oulu were too primitive to even premiere at Helsinki. \"No Tears at the Fair\" (1927) and \"The Man of Snowbound Forests\" (1928), two now lost films produced in Tampere by Aquila-Suomi and directed by Uuno Eskola were better attemptsl, at least according to their contemporaries. Nothing permanent production was left in Tampere, but one of Aquila's producers, painter Kalle Kaarna, proved to be a gifted director in his own right. His first film \"With the Blade of a Sword\" (1928) was boldly advertised as a neutral story about the painful civil war of 1918, and his second film, \"A Song about the Heroism of Labour\" (1929) introduced (although quite conventionally) a new kind of proletarian hero to the public. Unfortunately these films have also vanished for good.\n\nThe first experiments with sound were done by Lahyn-Filmi, a provincial company operating in Turku. The first full-length sound film with song and talk was Lahyn's \"Say It in Finnish\" (1931), directed by company's leader Yrjö Nyberg (later Norta). This lost film was more a collection of musical revue numbers than a feature.\n\nSuomi-Filmi transformed its production from silent to sound films during the same year. The first Finnish film with soundtrack was the company's \"Dressed Like Adam and a Bit Like Eve Too\" (1931), based on a popular play by Agapetus (pseudonym of Yrjö Soini). There was only music and some sound effects on the soundtrack, so the company's first true sound film was Karu's \"The Lumberjack's Bride\" (1931), another rural drama.\n\nIn 1933 Karu was kicked out from Suomi-Filmi, his own company. He took his revenge by founding a new one called Suomen Filmiteollisuus, which started to use initials SF in its logo. This company managed far better than previous attempts to compete with Suomi-Filmi, and right after couple successful comedies directed by Karu it had grown as significant as its rival. It seemed at this point to be possible only for Karu to create successful production companies in Finland.\n\nThe competition between the two companies proved to be fruitful. At the end of the decade there were about twenty full-length features made every year. The quality of the productions was high, the field of the subjects expanding and the popularity of domestic films increasing. With its own stars and creative producers, Finnish film industry began to remind a national miniature of Hollywood. Alongside with the two big studios, some minor ones did well also.\n\nSound had increased the public's eagerness to see domestic films. The great breakthrough for Finnish talkies came with \"The Foreman of Siltala Farm\" (1934), a well-recorded comedy by Suomi-Filmi, that was seen by over 900 000 viewers.\n\nErkki Karu was instantly replaced with Risto Orko as the head of company, a place he held until the 1990s (although this was long after the company had stopped movie-making). Orko had directed \"The Foreman of Siltala Farm\", and he returned to directing a few times since, most notably with two historical and patriotic dramas at the end of the decade: \"Soldier's Bride\" (1938) and \"Activists\" (1939). Most of his films as a director remain forgettable.\n\nThe most important director at Suomi-Filmi was Valentin Vaala, who had a stunningly creative period at the end of the 1930s. After the silent years, Vaala had directed three more films for his first company Fennica. When he started the fourth, the company went broke. Now he moved to Suomi-Filmi, and although his first movie there (\"Everybody's Love\", 1935) was quite a modest comedy, it was very popular, and most importantly, introduced two of the most beloved Finnish stars to the public: Ansa Ikonen and Tauno Palo.\n\nVaala's last Fennica-films had been urban comedies, a genre which he greatly developed at his new studio with his next two light-weighted films, \"Substitute Wife\" and \"Substitute Man\" (both 1936) . \"Hulda of Juurakko\" (1937) was far more serious attempt in the same field: a socially conscious story about a country girl who arrives to the big city, and who inevitably faces the problems of inequality between sexes. The film and its subject were greeted with huge enthusiasm by the audiences.\n\nVaala was also a master within the rural subjects and romantic melodramas. In 1938 he made the first and best film in the series of agrarian family saga of Niskavuori (\"Women of Niskavuori\").\n\nAfter his early death in 1935, Karu was replaced by Toivo Särkkä in the head of the company. Särkkä led SF until its bankruptcy in 1965. Särkkä was the most prolific producer and director that Finnish film has ever seen: he has way over 200 feature productions in his filmography, of which he directed 51. With Yrjö Norta, he directed most of the company's films in the 1930s, including religious drama \"As Dream and Shadow...\" (1937) and patriotic historical film \"Manifest in February\" (1939). Särkkä's and Norta's output includes some highly popular folk comedies like \"Lapatossu\" (1937) - with beloved comedy actor Aku Korhonen - and \"The Regiment's Trouble Boy\" (1938), the model of Finnish military farce genre.\n\nAlong with Suomi-Filmi and SF, few minor companies were able to produce many films during the golden age. With Vaala's films, these sort of local \"poverty row\" productions are the most fascinating films made during the 1930s.\n\nA new generation of film-makers were eager to take over as the old production companies, such as Suomi-Filmi and SF, were collapsing. Risto Jarva was inspired by the French avant-garde and new wave, which developed to social realism seen in \"Työmiehen päiväkirja\" (1967), and eventually to comedies \"Loma\" (1976) and \"Jäniksen vuosi\" (1977). Mikko Niskanen began his career back in 1962 with \"Pojat\", starring then unknown Vesa-Matti Loiri. Niskanen joined the new wave with \"Käpy selän alla\" (1966) and \"Lapualaismorsian\" (1967). The 1960s also marked the rise of new style of Finnish comedy films under Pertti Pasanen, such as X-Paroni, Noin 7 Veljestä and Näköradiomiehen Ihmeelliset Siekailut. Rauni Mollberg adapted two of Timo K. Mukka's \"magically realistic\" Lapland novels to the big screen: \"Maa on syntinen laulu\" (1973) and \"Milka\" (1983).\n\nThe old guard of the previous film-making generation was symbolically thrown from the throne in the beginning of 1980 by a Finnish-Soviet co-production, \"Tulitikkuja lainaamassa\", followed by Tapio Suominen's \"Täältä tullaan, elämä!\". Edvin Laine and Mikko Niskanen made their last movies, and the decade saw nearly 30 directorial debuts, including movies from Mika & Aki Kaurismäki, Markku Lehmuskallio, Pirjo Honkasalo, Taavi Kassila, Janne Kuusi, Matti Kuortti, Matti Ijäs, Olli Soinio, Lauri Törhönen, Claes Olsson, Veikko Aaltonen, and Pekka Parikka.\n\n\"Valehtelija\" (1981) and \"Arvottomat\" (1982), directed by Mika and written by Aki Kaurismäki, broke the status quo in Finnish film industry by bringing back creativity and small scale production. Mika went to pursue a more traditional way of film making in his career with \"Klaani\" (1984), \"Rosso\" (1985), and \"Helsinki Napoli All Night Long\" (1987). Aki has taken less deviations in style and theme, and his films are known for minimalistic non-verbal communication and dead-pan delivery of dialogs. While Aki is best known for the Suomi-trilogy \"Kauas pilvet karkaavat\" (1996), \"Mies vailla menneisyyttä\" (2002), and \"Laitakaupungin valot\" (2006), his work also includes comedy such as \"Leningrad Cowboys Go America\" (1989).\n\nThe beginning of the 1990s did not look too good to the film industry, because the national economy was on a strong decline. Film financing was not a priority to the government-backed Finnish Film Foundation, which is responsible for the majority of movie financing in Finland. Fortunately the situation would flip completely upside down by 1999, when nearly 30 domestic movies premiered. \"Poika ja ilves\", \"Häjyt\", and \"Kulkuri ja joutsen\" enjoyed over 200 000 viewers each, and helped to bring the popularity of domestic movies back to where it was a decade earlier.\n\nProlific directors introduced in the 1990s include Markku Pölönen, Auli Mantila, and Jarmo Lampela. A few popular genres can be identified from the last two decades. \"Rukajärven tie\", \"Pikkusisar\", and \"Hylätyt talot, autiot pihat\" take place during World War II. \"Kulkuri ja joutsen\" (1999), \"Badding\" (2000), \"Rentun Ruusu\" (2001), \"Sibelius\" (2003), and \"Aleksis Kiven elämä\" (2002) portray the life of popular public figures in Finland.\n\n2005 saw the release of amateur science fiction parody film , which was released online as a free download. The film has been downloaded over 9 million times and is internationally the most viewed Finnish film.\n\nIn 2011, Finland produced 31 films, 24 of which were full-length features and the other seven were documentaries.\n\nIn 2016, the three most watched films in Finland were all Finnish family films: \"Ricky Rapper and The Nighthawk 2016\", \"The Angry Birds Movie\", and \"Kanelia kainaloon, Tatu ja Patu!\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24338830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24338830", "title": "Fallout Online", "text": "Fallout Online\n\nFallout Online was a massively multiplayer online game (MMO) set in the \"Fallout\" universe that was being developed by Masthead Studios and was to be published by Interplay, with members of the Interplay team providing creative control and design. Chris Taylor and Mark O'Green, two of the creators of the original \"Fallout\", were among the developers; Jason Anderson, one of the other makers of \"Fallout\", was involved in the project between 2007 and 2009, but then left the team. Interplay's rights to develop and publish this game have been the subject of legal disputes between Interplay and Bethesda Softworks, the current owner of the \"Fallout\" franchise. An out-of-court settlement was reached in 2012 as Bethesda received full rights to the \"Fallout\" online game for two million dollars, eventually releasing its own online game, \"Fallout 76\", six years later.\n\nAccording to Interplay, they had created a large and multi-part \"game-worldwide meta-puzzle\". This meta-puzzle includes the puzzle structure, code system, and planned locations, which is designed to foster cooperation and competition among players for an extended time period. Interplay claimed it had mapped out approximately of terrain which had textures, with objects and characters implemented into it. Several game zones had been blocked out with textured and populated 3D objects. The initial starting zones for each player character race have also been designed, making it so that each character of a different race has a different story to start with. Computer models for many types of creatures had been designed and the 3D geometry and textures created and some NPCs have been created to live in the game. \"Fallout Online\" combat, leveling, character development, item crafting, skills have been written and tested. Interplay has revealed that it has created player-run towns (towns controlled by players), guild centers and social centers for players to interact in.\n\nAccording to Feargus Urquhart, when Brian Fargo was still the president of Interplay, Fargo proposed a possible \"Fallout\" MMO to be made by Black Isle, but Urquhart refused, saying, \"The reason at the time, because I would have loved to have made a \"Fallout\" MMO, was that I believed that Interplay was just not in a situation where they had the resources to do it. When you go off to do an MMO it's going to cost $100 million before you get it on the shelf; you've gotta buy servers and you've gotta have service people, and you have to have Game Masters. It's an undertaking, and on top of that, it means that you do have to do all that stuff so what else are you going to focus on? What other games are you going to be able to make?\"\n\nIn November 2006, Interplay, headed by Herve Caen, filed a Form 8-K filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding a potential \"Fallout\" massively multiplayer online game. In April 2007, Bethesda Softworks, the developer of \"Fallout 3\", purchased full rights to the \"Fallout\" IP for US$5.75 million. While Bethesda now owned the rights to the \"Fallout\" MMO IP as well, clauses in the purchase agreement allowed Interplay to license the rights to the development of the MMO. Specific requirements were stated in the agreement that if not met, Interplay would immediately lose and surrender its license rights for \"Fallout\". Development must have begun within 24 months of the date of the agreement (April 4, 2007), and Interplay must have secured $30 million within that time frame or forfeit its rights to license. Interplay would furthermore need to launch the MMOG within four years of the beginning of development, and pay Bethesda 12 percent of sales and subscription fees for the use of the IP.\n\nOn August 1, 2007, ZeniMax Media Inc., parent company of Bethesda Softworks, announced the creation of ZeniMax Online Studios. The division would be headed by Matt Firor, a well-known expert in the field of online gaming, and would focus on the massively multiplayer online game (MMO) market segment. It might work on a \"Fallout\" MMO in the future, if Interplay fails to gather enough money for their \"Fallout Online\" project.\n\nIn November 2007, Interplay reopened in-house development and hired \"Fallout\" developer Jason D. Anderson as creative director for an unannounced MMO. Given the aforementioned facts, it is most likely that the game Anderson was working on is Interplay's \"Fallout\" MMO, given that he was the contact name of Interplay's jobs appliance and that \"Fallout\" was referred in the job requirements. In March 2009, Anderson left Interplay and joined InXile Entertainment.\n\nOn June 30, 2008, it was announced that Interactive Game Group, LLC (created by Frederic Chesnais, former CEO of Atari, which now also owns MicroProse) purchased 2,000,000 shares of Interplay stock, as consideration for entering into a game production agreement, likely related to \"Fallout Online\".\n\nOn April 2, 2009 Interplay announced a binding letter of intent with Masthead Studios, a Bulgarian-based developer, to fund the development of \"Project V13\". Masthead and Interplay teams would work together under the direction and control of Interplay to complete development of the project. On June 15, 2010, the game was officially announced as \"Fallout Online\". The game was planned to be co-developed between Interplay and Masthead Studios, and to use Masthead's Earthrise Engine, used on Masthead's first game, \"Earthrise\".\n\nOn April 15, 2009, Bethesda Softworks announced a move to rescind the \"Fallout\" MMO license. Interplay received notice from Bethesda that it intended to terminate the trademark license agreement, claiming that Interplay was in breach of the agreement for failure to commence full scale development by April 4, 2009 and to secure certain funding for the game. Interplay disputed these claims. On July 15, 2009, \"Project V13\" developer Chris Taylor posted a reply on the Interplay website \"Project V13\" Forum thread refuting the claims that Interplay lost the rights to the \"Fallout\" MMO.\n\nOn September 8, 2009 Bethesda filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Interplay in the Maryland District Court. Bethesda claimed that Interplay had only licensed the \"Fallout\" name to use for their game and could not use any of its assets. Interplay counteracted this claim by stating that they did not license the name to make an online poker game titled \"Fallout\". They stated that what Bethesda was claiming was comparable to having a \"Snow White\" movie and the princess not appearing in it at all. Interplay further stated that if Bethesda refuses to let them complete \"Fallout Online\", then they will be able to release only one more \"Fallout\" IP with its DLCs before the rights revert to Interplay, a notion that will give Interplay the full rights to \"Fallout Online\" and the rest of the \"Fallout\" series. Interplay won the injunction resulting in Bethesda calling for an appeal. It was then revealed that prior to April 9, 2009 that Interplay had employed game designers, writers, and artists who had substantially completed the \"Fallout Online\" game design, including an online wiki dedicated to the game's development, which when printed and produced to Bethesda's counsel as it existed on April 4, 2009 consisted of nearly 2,200 pages. Prior to April 4, 2009, Interplay had created substantial concept art, solidified its technology plan by licensing a game engine and development tools set from Masthead Studios that would have cost Interplay millions of dollars to develop from scratch. A playable game space also existed, based on Interplay's concept art and developed by Masthead and multiple users from Europe and the U.S. could log into and interact within the game. For the game, Masthead was tasked with revising and improving its technology, including its game engine, tools and network software. On December 10, 2009 the court denied Bethesda's request for preliminary injunction. Interplay was able to continue development on the project until the case was resolved.\n\nBethesda then sued Masthead Studios and asked for a preliminary injunction against the company. The Court denied Bethesda's motion before Masthead Studios had even had an opportunity to file a response in opposition. Bethesda's attempt to appeal the unfavorable decision was quickly denied. Bethesda later filed a motion in limine against Interplay in an attempt to suppress evidence that would have supported Interplay at trial, namely that Interplay had satisfied the conditions of the original contract. In response, Interplay filed its own motion in limine the day after in an attempt to prevent Bethesda from producing a formally undisclosed expert witness, who was expected to offer expert testimony regarding the meaning of contract terms contained in the Trademark License Agreement. The jury trial requested by Bethesda was canceled due to the language of the APA contract (contract that sold \"Fallout\" to Bethesda), which stated that all legal disputes could only be resolved by a bench trial, leaving the outcome of the case in the hands of a single judge. It is unknown if this was a simple oversight by Bethesda or something brought to the courts attention by Interplay.\n\nPer an out of court settlement, \"Fallout Online\" was cancelled. However, Interplay through its Black Isle division continues to work on \"Project V13\" but will remove any and all references to \"Fallout\" to honor the settlement. Because of legal terming and no previous legal action before Bethesda filed the suit, Interplay was forced to give over all property pertaining to the \"Fallout\" MMO. Interplay was still able to sell copies of \"Fallout\", \"Fallout 2\" and \"\", but its permission to do so ended on December 31, 2013. Bethesda's own \"Fallout\" MMO game, \"Fallout 76\", was released in 2018.\n\n"}

Among the famous contemporary artists include Jean-Michel Jarre, Air, Daft Punk, Justice and M83.\n\nThe earliest known sound recording device was the phonautograph, patented in 1857 by Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville.\n\nIn 1928, the Ondes Martenot was invented by Maurice Martenot, who debuted it in Paris. This electronic musical instrument was most famously used in the \"Turangalîla-Symphonie\" by Olivier Messiaen as well as other works by him. The Ondes Martenot was also used by other composers such as Andre Jolivet, Pierre Boulez, Arthur Honegger, Charles Koechlin, Darius Milhaud, Gilles Tremblay and Edgard Varèse.\n\nIn 1942, the French composer and theoretician Pierre Schaeffer, began his exploration of radiophony when he joined Jacques Copeau and his pupils in the foundation of the Studio d'Essai de la Radiodiffusion Nationale. His work laid the foundations of the Musique concrète. This technique involved editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds. The first pieces of \"musique concrète\" in Paris were assembled by him, who went on to collaborate with Pierre Henry.\n\nOn 5 October 1948, Radiodiffusion Française (RDF) broadcast composer Pierre Schaeffer's \"Etude aux chemins de fer\". This was the first \"movement\" of \"Cinq études de bruits\", and marked the beginning of studio realizations and musique concrète (or acousmatic art). Schaeffer employed a disk-cutting lathe, four turntables, a four-channel mixer, filters, an echo chamber, and a mobile recording unit. Not long after this, Henry began collaborating with Schaeffer, a partnership that would have profound and lasting effects on the direction of electronic music. Another associate of Schaeffer, Edgard Varèse, began work on \"Déserts\", a work for chamber orchestra and tape. The tape parts were created at Pierre Schaeffer's studio, and were later revised at Columbia University.\n\nIn 1950, Schaeffer gave the first public (non-broadcast) concert of musique concrète at the Ecole Normale de Musique de Paris. \"Schaeffer used a PA system, several turntables, and mixers. Later that same year, Pierre Henry collaborated with Schaeffer on \"Symphonie pour un homme seul\" (1950) the first major work of musique concrete. In Paris in 1951, in what was to become an important worldwide trend, RTF established the first studio for the production of electronic music. Also in 1951, Schaeffer and Henry produced an opera, \"Orpheus\", for concrete sounds and voices.\n\nIn 1970, the President of France Georges Pompidou asked to the composer Pierre Boulez to found an institution for research in new forms of music. The \"Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique\" was created under his direction. Since then, IRCAM has been an avant-garde institute for science about music, sound and electro-acoustical art music in France.\n\nIn 1969, La cage/Erosmachine is a very early electronic music work by Jean-Michel Jarre who become worldwide famous with the album Oxygene in 1976. Among other experimental we can cite Igor Wakhevitch with Hathor (1973) and François de Roubaix for the soundtrack of the Jacques-Yves Cousteau'film Antartique (1974). The space music and space disco become popular with Space, Magic Fly (1977) ; Cerrone, Supernature (1977) ; Droïds, The force (1977) and Bernard Fevre aka Black Devil Disco Club (1975-1978). The following one in the late 70's and early 80's were notably Philippe Laurent aka Hot Bip (Industrieuse, 1979) and René Roussel with Caramel (1980).\n\nFollowing precursors Jean-Michel Jarre and Cerrone, many French electronic artists have gained worldwide recognition under the name of \"French Touch\", especially Daft Punk, David Guetta, M83, Justice and Air.\n\n"}
{"id": "667361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=667361", "title": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)", "text": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (released in the United States as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) is a 2001 fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It is based on J. K. Rowling's 1997 novel of the same name. The film is the first instalment in the long-running \"Harry Potter\" film series and was written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman. Its story follows Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as he discovers that he is a famous wizard and begins his education. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, with Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger.\n\nWarner Bros. bought the film rights to the book in 1999 for a reported £1 million ($1.65 million in 1999). Production began in the United Kingdom in 2000, with Chris Columbus being chosen to create the film from a short list of directors that included Steven Spielberg and Rob Reiner. Rowling insisted that the entire cast be British and Irish, and the film was shot at Leavesden Film Studios and historic buildings around the United Kingdom.\n\nThe film was released to cinemas in the United Kingdom and United States on 16 November 2001. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $974.8 million at the box office worldwide. The highest-grossing film of 2001, it is the 37th highest-grossing of all-time (2nd at the time of its release) and the second most successful instalment of the \"Harry Potter\" series behind \"Deathly Hallows – Part 2\". The film was nominated for many awards, including Academy Awards for Best Original Score, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design. It was followed by seven sequels, beginning with \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" in 2002 and ending with \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\" in 2011, nearly ten years after the first film's release.\n\nIn late 1981, Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, and Rubeus Hagrid, professors of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, deliver a recently orphaned infant named Harry Potter to his only remaining relatives, the Dursleys. Ten years later, Harry has been battling a disjointed life with the Dursleys. After inadvertently causing an accident during a family trip to the zoo, Harry begins receiving unsolicited letters by owls. After the Dursleys escape to an island to avoid any more letters, Hagrid re-appears and informs Harry that he is actually a wizard, and has been accepted into Hogwarts against the Dursleys' wishes. After taking Harry to Diagon Alley to buy his supplies for Hogwarts including a wizard uniform, a wand and a pet owl named Hedwig as a birthday present, Hagrid informs him of his past; Harry is the son of two wizards who met their demise via a Killing Curse at the hands of Lord Voldemort, a malevolent, all-powerful wizard. Harry, the only survivor in the chaos, thus becomes well-known in the wizarding world as \"The Boy Who Lived\".\n\nHarry is then taken to King's Cross station to board a train to the school, where he meets three other students: Ron Weasley, whom he quickly befriends; Hermione Granger, an intelligent witch born to muggle parents; and Draco Malfoy, a child from a wealthy wizarding family whom he immediately clashes with. After arriving at school, the students assemble in the Great Hall, where Harry and all the other \"first-years\" are sorted by the Sorting Hat between four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Although the Sorting Hat considers placing Harry in Slytherin alongside Draco, he is placed into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione.\n\nAt Hogwarts, Harry begins learning magic spells and discovers more about his past and his parents. After recovering the Remembrall of clumsy Gryffindor student Neville Longbottom, Harry is recruited for Gryffindor's Quidditch team as a Seeker, which is extremely rare for first-year students. While exploring the school one night, Harry and his friends discover a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy in a restricted area of the school. Ron insults Hermoine after being embarrassed by her in a charms lesson with Professor Flitwick, causing Hermione to lock herself in the girls' bathroom. She is soon attacked by a troll but Harry and Ron manage to save her, befriending her in the process.\n\nThe children later find out Fluffy is guarding the Philosopher's Stone, an object that can be used to grant its owner immortality. Harry suspects that potions teacher and head of Slytherin House Severus Snape is trying to obtain the stone in order to return Voldemort to physical form. Hagrid accidentally reveals to the trio that Fluffy will fall asleep if played music. Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide that night to try and find the stone before Snape does, but discover that Fluffy is already asleep. They get past Fluffy and face a series of safeguards. These include surviving a deadly plant known as Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys which bruises Harry, and a dangerous life-sized game of chess that nearly kills Ron.\n\nAfter getting past the tasks, Harry discovers that it was Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Quirrell who was trying to claim the stone, and that Snape was actually protecting Harry all along. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals a weak Voldemort to be living on the back of his head. Through an enchantment placed by Dumbledore, Harry finds himself in possession of the stone. Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for bringing his parents back from the dead, but Harry refuses, causing Quirrell to attack. Harry kills Quirrell by burning his skin and reducing him to dust, after which Voldemort's spirit rises from Quirrell's ashes and passes through Harry, knocking him unconscious.\n\nHarry wakes up in the school's hospital wing with Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and that Ron and Hermione are safe. Dumbledore also reveals how Harry was able to defeat Quirrell: when Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances, tying them for first place with Slytherin. Dumbledore then awards ten points to Neville, who had attempted to stop his friends, giving Gryffindor enough points to win the House Cup. Harry returns home for the summer, happy to finally have a real home in Hogwarts.\n\nRowling insisted that the cast be kept British. Susie Figgis was appointed as casting director, working with both Columbus and Rowling in auditioning the lead roles of Harry, Ron and Hermione. Open casting calls were held for the main three roles, with only British children being considered. The principal auditions took place in three parts, with those auditioning having to read a page from the novel, then to improvise a scene of the students' arrival at Hogwarts, and finally to read several pages from the script in front of Columbus. Scenes from Columbus' script for the 1985 film \"Young Sherlock Holmes\" were also used in auditions. On 11 July 2000, Figgis left the production, complaining that Columbus did not consider any of the thousands of children they had auditioned \"worthy\". On 8 August 2000, the virtually unknown Daniel Radcliffe and newcomers Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were selected to play Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, respectively.\n\nIn 1997, producer David Heyman searched for a children's book that could be adapted into a well-received film. He had planned to produce Diana Wynne Jones' novel \"The Ogre Downstairs\", but his plans fell through. His staff at Heyday Films then suggested \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", which his assistant believed was \"a cool idea.\" Heyman pitched the idea to Warner Bros. and in 1999, Rowling sold the company the rights to the first four \"Harry Potter\" books for a reported £1 million (US$1,982,900). A demand Rowling made was that the principal cast be kept strictly British, nonetheless allowing for the inclusion of Irish actors such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" where characters from the book are specified as such. Rowling was hesitant to sell the rights because she \"didn't want to give them control over the rest of the story\" by selling the rights to the characters, which would have enabled Warner Bros. to make non-author-written sequels.\n\nAlthough Steven Spielberg initially negotiated to direct the film, he declined the offer. Spielberg reportedly wanted the adaptation to be an animated film, with American actor Haley Joel Osment to provide Harry Potter's voice, or a film that incorporated elements from subsequent books as well. Spielberg contended that, in his opinion, it was like \"shooting ducks in a barrel. It's just a slam dunk. It's just like withdrawing a billion dollars and putting it into your personal bank accounts. There's no challenge.\" Rowling maintains that she had no role in choosing directors for the films and that \"[a]nyone who thinks I could (or would) have 'veto-ed' [ sic ] him [Spielberg] needs their Quick-Quotes Quill serviced.\" Heyman recalled that Spielberg decided to direct \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" instead.\n\nAfter Spielberg left, talks began with other directors, including: Chris Columbus, Terry Gilliam, Jonathan Demme, Mike Newell, Alan Parker, Wolfgang Petersen, Rob Reiner, Ivan Reitman, Tim Robbins, Brad Silberling, M. Night Shyamalan and Peter Weir. Petersen and Reiner both pulled out of the running in March 2000, and the choice was narrowed down to Silberling, Columbus, Parker and Gilliam. Rowling's first choice director was Terry Gilliam, but Warner Bros. chose Columbus, citing his work on other family films such as \"Home Alone\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" as influences for their decision. Columbus pitched his vision of the film for two hours, stating that he wanted the Muggle scenes \"to be bleak and dreary\" but those set in the wizarding world \"to be steeped in color, mood, and detail.\" He took inspiration from David Lean's adaptations of \"Great Expectations\" (1946) and \"Oliver Twist\" (1948), wishing to use \"that sort of darkness, that sort of edge, that quality to the cinematography,\" while being further inspired by the colour designs from \"Oliver!\" (1968) and \"The Godfather\" (1972).\n\nSteve Kloves was selected to write the screenplay. He described adapting the book as \"tough\", as it did not \"lend itself to adaptation as well as the next two books.\" Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros., which he \"almost never read\", but \"Harry Potter\" jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, and became an instant fan of the series. When speaking to Warner Bros., he stated that the film had to be British, and had to be true to the characters. Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to \"[destroy] her baby.\" Rowling admitted that she \"was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves,\" but recalled her initial meeting with him: \"The first time I met him, he said to me, 'You know who my favourite character is?' And I thought, You're gonna say Ron. I know you're gonna say Ron. But he said 'Hermione.' And I just kind of melted.\" Rowling received a large amount of creative control, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.\n\nWarner Bros. had initially planned to release the film over 4 July 2001 weekend, making for such a short production window that several proposed directors pulled themselves out of the running. Due to time constraints, the date was put back to 16 November 2001.\n\nTwo British film industry officials requested that the film be shot in the United Kingdom, offering their assistance in securing filming locations, the use of Leavesden Film Studios, as well as changing the UK's child labour laws (adding a small number of working hours per week and making the timing of on-set classes more flexible). Warner Bros. accepted their proposal. Filming began on 29 September 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios and concluded on 23 March 2001, with final work being done in July. Principal photography took place on 2 October 2000 at North Yorkshire's Goathland railway station. Canterbury Cathedral and Scotland's Inverailort Castle were both touted as possible locations for Hogwarts; Canterbury rejected Warner Bros. proposal due to concerns about the film's \"pagan\" theme. Alnwick Castle and Gloucester Cathedral were eventually selected as the principal locations for Hogwarts, with some scenes also being filmed at Harrow School. Other Hogwarts scenes were filmed in Durham Cathedral over a two-week period; these included shots of the corridors and some classroom scenes. Oxford University's Divinity School served as the Hogwarts Hospital Wing, and Duke Humfrey's Library, part of the Bodleian, was used as the Hogwarts Library. Filming for Privet Drive took place on Picket Post Close in Bracknell, Berkshire. Filming in the street took two days instead of the planned single day, so payments to the street's residents were correspondingly increased. For all the subsequent film's scenes set in Privet Drive, filming took place on a constructed set in Leavesden Film Studios, which proved to have been cheaper than filming on location. London's Australia House was selected as the location for Gringotts Wizarding Bank, while Christ Church, Oxford was the location for the Hogwarts trophy room. London Zoo was used as the location for the scene in which Harry accidentally sets a snake on Dudley, with King's Cross Station also being used as the book specifies.\nBecause the American title was different, all scenes that mention the philosopher's stone by name had to be re-shot, once with the actors saying \"philosopher's\" and once with \"sorcerer's\". The children filmed for four hours and then did three hours of schoolwork. They developed a liking for fake facial injuries from the makeup staff. Radcliffe was initially meant to wear green contact lenses as his eyes are blue, and not green like Harry's, but the lenses gave Radcliffe extreme irritation. Upon consultation with Rowling, it was agreed that Harry could have blue eyes.\n\nJudianna Makovsky designed the costumes. She re-designed the Quidditch robes, having initially planned to use those shown on the cover of the American book, but deemed them \"a mess.\" Instead, she dressed the Quidditch players in \"preppie sweaters, 19th century fencing breeches and arm guards.\" Production designer Stuart Craig built the sets at Leavesden Studios, including Hogwarts Great Hall, basing it on many English cathedrals. Although originally asked to use an existing old street to film the Diagon Alley scenes, Craig decided to build his own set, comprising Tudor, Georgian and Queen Anne architecture.\n\nColumbus originally planned to use both animatronics and CGI animation to create the magical creatures, including Fluffy. Nick Dudman, who worked on \"\", was given the task of creating the needed prosthetics, with Jim Henson's Creature Shop providing creature effects. John Coppinger stated that the magical creatures that needed to be created had to be designed multiple times. The film features nearly 600 special effects shots, involving numerous companies. Industrial Light & Magic created Lord Voldemort's face on the back of Quirrell, Rhythm & Hues animated Norbert (Hagrid's baby dragon); and Sony Pictures Imageworks produced the Quidditch scenes.\n\nJohn Williams was selected to compose the score. Williams composed the score at his homes in Los Angeles and Tanglewood before recording it in London in September 2001. One of the main themes is entitled \"Hedwig's Theme\"; Williams retained it for his finished score as \"everyone seemed to like it\" and therefore it was a recurring theme throughout the series.\n\nColumbus repeatedly checked with Rowling to make sure he was getting minor details correct. Kloves described the film as being \"really faithful\" to the book. He added dialogue, of which Rowling approved. One of the lines originally included had to be removed after Rowling told him that it would directly contradict an event in the then-unreleased fifth \"Harry Potter\" novel \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\".\n\nSeveral minor characters have been removed from the film version, most prominent among them the spectral History of Magic teacher, Professor Binns, and Peeves the poltergeist. The book's first chapter is from the viewpoint of Vernon and Petunia Dursley the day before they are given Harry to look after, highlighting how non-magical people react to magic. The film removes this, beginning with Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Hagrid leaving Harry with the Dursleys (although McGonagall tells Dumbledore how she had been watching the Dursleys all day). Harry's less than pleasant times at Mrs. Figg's are cut from the film while the boa constrictor from Brazil in the zoo becomes a Burmese Python in the film. Some conflicts, such as Harry and Draco's encounter with each other in Madam Malkin's robe shop and midnight duel, are not in the film. Some of Nicolas Flamel's role is changed or cut altogether. Norbert is mentioned to have been taken away by Dumbledore in the film; whilst the book sees Harry and Hermione have to take him by hand to Charlie Weasley's friends. Rowling described the scene as \"the one part of the book that she felt [could easily] be changed\". As a result, the reason for the detention in the Forbidden Forest was changed: In the novel, Harry and Hermione are put in detention for being caught by Filch when leaving the Astronomy Tower after hours, Neville and Malfoy are given detention when caught in the corridor by Professor McGonagall. In the film, Harry, Hermione and Ron receive detention after Malfoy catches them in Hagrid's hut after hours (Malfoy however, is given detention for being out of bed after hours). Firenze the centaur, who is described in the book as being palomino with light blonde hair, is shown to be dark in the film. The Quidditch pitch is altered from a traditional stadium to an open field circled by spectator towers. In the trio's final quest for the Philosopher's Stone, Hermione's test, solving a logic problem about a row of bottles, is omitted.\n\nThe first teaser poster was released on 1 December 2000. The first teaser trailer was released via satellite on 2 March 2001 and debuted in cinemas with the release of \"See Spot Run\". The soundtrack was released on 30 October 2001 in a CD format. A video game based on the film was released on 15 November 2001 by Electronic Arts for several consoles. A port for the game, for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox was released in 2003. Mattel won the rights to produce toys based on the film, to be sold exclusively through Warner Brothers' stores. Hasbro also produced products, including confectionery products based on those from the series. Warner Bros. signed a deal worth US$150 million with Coca-Cola to promote the film, and Lego produced a series of sets based on buildings and scenes from the film, as well as a .\n\nWarner Bros. first released the film on VHS and DVD on 11 February 2002 in the E3 UK 11 May 2002 in the UK and 28 May 2002 in the US. The VHS and DVD (The Special Edition) was re-released in 7 May 2004 An Ultimate Edition was later released exclusively in the US that included a Blu-ray and DVD. The release contains an extended version of the film, with many of the deleted scenes edited back in; additionally, the set includes the existing special features disc, Radcliffe's, Grint's, and Watson's first screen tests, a feature-length special \"Creating the World of Harry Potter Part 1: The Magic Begins\", and a 48-page hardcover booklet. The extended version has a running time of about 159 minutes, which has previously been shown during certain television airings. Between May and June 2002, the film sold 10million copies, almost 60% of which were DVD sales.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 4 November 2001, with the cinema arranged to resemble Hogwarts School. The film was greatly received at the box office. In the United States, it made $32.3 million on its opening day, breaking the single day record previously held by \"\". On the second day of release, the film's gross increased to $33.5 million, breaking the record for biggest single day again. In total, it made $90.3 million during its first weekend, breaking the record for highest-opening weekend of all time that was previously held by \"\". It held the record until the following May when \"Spider-Man\" made $114.8 million in its opening weekend. The film held onto the No. 1 spot at the box-office for three consecutive weekends. The film also had the highest grossing 5-day (Wednesday-Sunday) Thanksgiving weekend record of $82.4 million, holding the title for twelve years until both \"\" and \"Frozen\" surpassed it with $110.1 million and $94 million respectively. Similar results were achieved across the world. In the United Kingdom, \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" broke the record for the highest-opening weekend ever, both including and excluding previews, making £16.3 million with and £9.8 million without previews. The film went on to make £66.1 million in the UK alone, making it the country's second highest-grossing film of all-time (after \"Titanic\"), until it was surpassed by \"Mamma Mia!\".\n\nIn total, the film earned $974.8 million at the worldwide box office, $317.6 million of that in the US and $657.2 million elsewhere, which made it the second highest-grossing film in history at the time, as well as the year's highest-grossing film. , it is the unadjusted thirty-fourth highest-grossing film of all-time and the second highest-grossing \"Harry Potter\" film to date after \"Deathly Hallows – Part 2\", which grossed more than $1 billion worldwide. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 55.9 million tickets in the US.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 80% based on 194 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" adapts its source material faithfully while condensing the novel's overstuffed narrative into an involving – and often downright exciting – big-screen magical caper.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 64 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert called \"Philosopher's Stone\" \"a classic,\" giving the film four out of four stars, and particularly praising the Quidditch scenes' visual effects. Praise was echoed by both \"The Telegraph\" and \"Empire\" reviewers, with Alan Morrison of the latter naming it the film's \"stand-out sequence\". Brian Linder of IGN.com also gave the film a positive review, but concluded that it \"isn't perfect, but for me it's a nice supplement to a book series that I love\". Although criticising the final half-hour, Jeanne Aufmuth of \"Palo Alto Online\" stated that the film would \"enchant even the most cynical of moviegoers.\" \"USA Today\" reviewer Claudia Puig gave the film three out of four stars, especially praising the set design and Robbie Coltrane's portrayal of Hagrid, but criticised John Williams' score and concluded \"ultimately many of the book's readers may wish for a more magical incarnation.\" The sets, design, cinematography, effects and principal cast were all given praise from Kirk Honeycutt of \"The Hollywood Reporter\", although he deemed John Williams' score \"a great clanging, banging music box that simply will not shut up.\" Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" compared the film positively with \"Gone with the Wind\" and put \"The script is faithful, the actors are just right, the sets, costumes, makeup and effects match and sometimes exceed anything one could imagine.\" Jonathan Foreman of the \"New York Post\" recalled that the film was \"remarkably faithful,\" to its literary counterpart as well as a \"consistently entertaining if overlong adaptation.\"\n\nRichard Corliss of \"Time\" magazine, considered the film a \"by the numbers adaptation,\" criticising the pace and the \"charisma-free\" lead actors. CNN's Paul Tatara found that Columbus and Kloves \"are so careful to avoid offending anyone by excising a passage from the book, the so-called narrative is more like a jamboree inside Rowling's head.\" Nathaniel Rogers of The Film Experience gave the film a negative review and wrote: \"\"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\" is as bland as movies can get.\" Ed Gonzalez of \"Slant Magazine\" wished that the film had been directed by Tim Burton, finding the cinematography \"bland and muggy,\" and the majority of the film a \"solidly dull celebration of dribbling goo.\" Elvis Mitchell of \"The New York Times\" was highly negative about the film, saying \"[the film] is like a theme park that's a few years past its prime; the rides clatter and groan with metal fatigue every time they take a curve.\" He also said it suffered from \"a lack of imagination\" and wooden characters, adding, \"The Sorting Hat has more personality than anything else in the movie.\"\n\nThe film received three Academy Award nominations: Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, and Best Original Score for John Williams. The film was also nominated for seven BAFTA Awards. These were Best British Film, Best Supporting Actor for Robbie Coltrane, as well as the awards for Best Costume Design, Production Design, Makeup and Hair, Sound and Visual Effects. The film won a Saturn Award for its costumes, and was nominated for eight more awards. It won other awards from the Casting Society of America and the Costume Designers Guild. It was nominated for the AFI Film Award for its special effects, and the Art Directors Guild Award for its production design.

The movement connects R&B, the Civil Rights Movement, and hip hop culture. The six elements Of the Hip Hop Movement are: Consciousness Awareness, Civil Rights Awareness, Activism Awareness, Justice, Political Awareness, Community Awareness in music. In 1990 while working with the rap/pop group Snap! Ronald \"Bee-Stinger\" Savage while in the State of New York carved the term Six elements of the Hip Hop Movement.The Hip Hop Movement is not only to entertain people but also to enlighten listeners of the struggle, the oppressed, and those who through lyrics to connect with. \n\nThe four elements of hip hop culture are graffiti, rapping, DJing, and break-dancing. Rabaka argues that the hip hop movement is just as deserving of critical scholarly inquiry as other black popular music, such as R & B. Hip hop has been documented to 1973 by Steven Hager. The word \"hip hop\" first appeared in print on September 21, 1981, in \"The Village Voice\" in a profile story of Africa Bambaataa written by Hager, who published the first comprehensive history of hip hop culture with St. Martins' Press. Taymullah Abdur-Rahman in a blog in The Huffington Press compares hip hop to The Civil Rights Movement.\n\nTaymullah Abdur-Rahman opined \"We couldn't reproduce Frederick Douglass but we had KRS-One. We didn’t try to imitate MLK but we had Chuck D. We remembered Harriet Tubman when we looked at Lauryn Hill. We didn’t need the Queen of Sheba, we had our own Queen...\"Latifah\"\" Jeff Chang in his book, \"Can’t Stop Won’t Stop\" states, \"there was no manifesto. The kids who started it were simply trying to find ways to pass the time, they were trying to have fun. They grew up under the politics of abandonment and because of this, their pastimes contained the seeds for a kind of mass cultural renewal.\"\n\nTodd Boyd in his book \",\" says \"I would suggest that you might get a better read of what's going on in the world of Black people today by listening to DMX on \"It's Dark and Hell is Hot\" than by listening to repeated broadcasts of Martin Luther King speeches.\"Hip hop is inherently political, the language is political,\" Boyd says. \"It uses language as a weapon — not a weapon to violate or not a weapon to offend, but a weapon that pushes the envelope that provokes people, makes people think.\"\"\n\nRonald Savage is the first known elected official in New York State in printed articles to come out of the Zulu Nation that paved the way for hip hop culture, Savage inspired many people with his fight to help change the laws of the statute of limitations against child molesters in New York State (Child Victims Act) making another statement of the Hip Hop Movement.\n"}

The game puts emphasis on survival and lets players co-operate with each other to achieve success. The game adapts an open development and allows the community to give input regarding the game's development. As Press Play was closed in March 2016, the game was no longer in development.\n\n\"Project: Knoxville\" is a third-person multiplayer survival game. Throughout the game, players can jump, sprint, and interact with the environments. The game's major objective is to survive and escape from an arena which is filled with different hostile enemies. These arenas are round-based, each one lasting for approximately ten to twenty minutes, and the game does not feature a persistent world. Players can interact with characters that are controlled by other players, and can choose whether to trust them or to distrust them. The game supports co-operative gameplay. As a result, players have the option to demand attention from other players, as well as requesting weapons, healing and currency from them. Some missions require multiple players to work and ally together, or else they will be unable to complete them. Competitive multiplayer elements are also present in the game, in which players can choose to eliminate or backfire at each other.\n\nIn the arena, the player will be accompanied by seven different players at the beginning of each match. They can pick up weapons that are sparsely scattered across the world to defend themselves and attack enemies They are also tasked to collect coins, which can be used to escape a level and upgrade the character the player is using. The number of coins in a level is limited, and some players may not be able to collect the coin needed to escape the level, and will get left behind in the arena. Players who die in the game can also enter an Afterlife mode. They can spawn objects that will influence a round, such as enemies or medkit next to surviving characters.\n\nThe game was currently being developed by Press Play, who had previously worked on \"\" and \"Kalimba\". On August 18, 2015, Press Play revealed three different projects they may work on, and asked the public to vote and choose the one that they wanted the most. The three projects were \"Project: Dwarka\", \"Project: Karoo\" and \"Project: Knoxville\". \"Dwarka\" is a dungeon crawler set in a first-person perspective. It tasks players to play as a dwarf and investigate dungeons, which are procedurally generated. \" Karoo\" is a simulation game, which tasks players to build and customize their own vehicles, and explore a wasteland to gather different resources. The third project is \"Knoxville\", which was ultimately chosen by the community. All of them feature multiplayer components.\n\nAccording to Press Play, the game was inspired by films like \"The Running Man\" and \"The Hunger Games\". Similar to the films, they put emphasis on survival and the relationships between players. The game's development was aimed to be transparent, as they would share new information of the game every other week through Twitch. Supporters would also get to join meetings of the development team through Skype.\n\nOn 7 March 2016 Microsoft announced that Press Play has closed down, and that the development of \"Project: Knoxville\" had ended. The decision was made as Microsoft wished to \"focus its investment and development on the games and franchises that fans find most exciting and want to play\".\n\n"}

Originally launched on October 27, 2003, it has been in continuous operation since October 25, 2004.\n\nA student wishing to use LAMP goes to the LAMP website, and selects several songs. LAMP assigns to the student a channel on MIT Cable (e.g. Channel 63), then begins playing the selected music on that channel for anyone to listen to.\n\nOne key advantage of LAMP, in addition to its being free for its users, is the fact that any piece of music is in theory available on it because copyright law is more lax about broadcasting over analog transmissions, such as MIT Cable, than it is about digital transmissions such as those made over computer networks. For example, a person wanting to transmit a copy of \"... Baby One More Time\", written by Max Martin and performed by Britney Spears, could do it either with an analog transmission or a digital transmission. Using an analog transmission would only require permission from BMG, the publisher, whereas use of a digital transmission would require Spears's permission as well.\n\nThis aspect of copyright law is problematic for those wishing to transmit songs by artists such as The Beatles. Their label, Apple Corps, as well as others, typically do not allow digital transmissions of their music, which is why their songs were not available on online music stores such as iTunes until late 2010. However, songs by The Beatles are available on LAMP, since LAMP doesn't require Apple Corps's permission.\n\nInitially, MIT purchased audio from LoudEye, Inc., in MP3 form. However, on the day of LAMP's initial launch, Universal Music Group approached Loudeye with concerns that it lacked the necessary licenses to make the MP3s that were sold to MIT. Without music, LAMP was forced to go on a hiatus of about one year, until a different method of obtaining music was devised.\n\nLAMP in its current incarnation requires someone to purchase a physical CD and place it in a CD jukebox, where it is then turned into an MP3. However, ripping MP3s of individual songs at will is still legally questionable, so LAMP takes advantage of the \"ephemeral recording\" provision of copyright law. Under this provision, consumers can create a \"transmission program\" so long as it is designed to be played back as a whole, in sequence. LAMP currently uses \"transmission programs\" that are approximately 30 minutes in length.\n\nLAMP is appropriately built with LAMP technologies. That is to say, it runs on Linux machines, uses an Apache webserver, a MySQL database, and Perl and PHP. Portions of the software are also written in C++.\n\n"}

{"id": "673840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=673840", "title": "Milk caps (game)", "text": "Milk caps (game)\n\nPogs, generically called milk caps, is a game that was popular among children during the mid 1990s.\n\nThe brand name \"Pog\" is owned by the World Pog Federation. The name pog originates from POG, a brand of juice made from passionfruit, orange, and guava; the use of POG bottle caps to play the game preceded the game's commercialization.\n\nThe game of milk caps possibly originated in Maui, Hawaii during the 1920s or 1930s, or possibly with origins in Menko, a Japanese card game very similar to milk caps, which has been in existence since the 17th century. The game of milk caps was played on the Hawaiian island of Maui as early as 1927. There are cap collectors that have dating till 1940s and 1950s.\n\nHaleakala Dairy of Maui sold a mixed fruit drink in a glass bottle with a cap under the brand name of POG. In 1955, Haleakala discontinued using the glass containers, but continued making the caps to allow the game to be played. Orchards Hawaii also continued to make milk caps after having stopped using glass bottles. In 1991, Haleakala expanded to the more populated Oahu island, which led to a revival of the game. With this revival, the Pog name began being used generically for the game.\n\nThe 1990s revival is credited to Blossom Galbiso, a teacher and guidance counselor who taught at Waialua Elementary School in Oahu. In 1991, Galbiso introduced the game she had played as a little girl to a new generation of students, soon incorporating milk caps into her fifth grade curriculum as a way of teaching math and as a nonviolent alternative to other popular schoolyard games, such as dodgeball. The game quickly spread from Oahu's North Shore, and by early 1992, STANPAC Inc., the small Canadian packaging company that had been manufacturing the milk caps distributed by Haleakala Dairy on Maui (the same caps that were collected by Galbiso for her class), was printing millions of milk caps every week for shipment to the Hawaiian island chain. The game soon spread to the mainland, first surfacing in California, Texas, Oregon, and Washington before spreading to the rest of the country. By 1993, the previously obscure game of milk caps, which had almost been forgotten, was now played throughout the world. \n\nMilk caps returned to popularity when the World POG Federation and the Canada Games Company reintroduced them under the Pog brand name in the 1990s. The Pog fad soared, and peaked in the mid-1990s. Pogs were being handed out for opening bank accounts and in McDonald's Happy Meals. With the end of the Pogs fad, Canada Games went out of business in 1997.\n\nSeven other companies entered the milk cap field after a comic book and card industry convention in January 1993. SkyBox International and Marvel added the product to their lines under the names SkyCaps and Hero Caps respectively. The game had spread to California, Florida and Texas.\n\nThe term Pog was claimed as trademark by the World Pog Federation while other companies claimed it was generic term as it was selected by the children that played the game. In October 1994, a lawsuit was settled between World Pog and Universal Pogs Association. Pog was recognized as World Pog's exclusive term and Universal Pogs changed its name to Universal Slammers, Inc.\n\nBecause many children would keep the milk caps they won in games from other players, many school districts considered milk caps a form of gambling. Milk caps proved to be major distractions from classes and the source of various playground arguments. These elements eventually led to the banning of milk caps from various schools across North America. Other bannings occurred across Australia.\n\nMilk caps generally involves two types of playing discs: milk caps and slammers. Milk caps are typically flat circular cardboard discs which are decorated with images on one or both sides. Traditional (or traditional-style) milk caps are made of rougher cardboard, are printed with limited colors, and often have a staple in them (as they appeared when used as actual POG bottlecaps), while modern commercial pogs were stiffer, thicker and are often printed with colorful glossy imagery.\n\nThe other equipment that is used is a slammer: a heavier game piece often made of metal, rubber, or more commonly plastic, which come in various thicknesses and weights. They are typically similar in diameter to milk caps. Metal slammers are not allowed in some games because they are usually heavier than other materials, giving the player with the first turn an unfair advantage, and have a tendency to damage the milk caps.\n\nRules vary among players, but the game variants generally have common gameplay features. Each player has his/her own collection of milk caps and one or more slammers. Before the game, players decide whether or not to play \"for keeps\", i.e. players get to keep the milk caps that they win during the game and must forfeit those that have been won by other players. The game can then begin as follows:\n\n\nThe World POG Federation was the licensed POG publisher, which was 14% owned by Haleakala Dairy, the trademark holder of POGs. Federation president in 1994 was Alan Rypinski. The company was based in Costa Mesa, California.\n\nThe Army and Air Force Exchange Service, the United States Department of Defense's largest and oldest exchange system, distributes milk-cap-like coinage as change at its stores in contingency areas (those supporting Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom). The reason for adopting milk caps as currency was that supply flights overseas had limited capacity and air-freight shipping involved high costs. Metal coinage weighs significantly more than paper milk caps, which are also much thinner than standard milk caps. While they are only issued in contingency areas, they are redeemable at any AAFES store worldwide.\n\nMenko (めんこ, 面子) is a Japanese card game played by two or more players, dating back to the 17th century. Each player uses Menko cards made from thick paper or cardboard, printed on one or both sides with images from anime, manga, and other works.\n\nThe card used in \"ttakji\" or \"ddakji\" () is constructed by folding two square pieces of paper together into a square. As with milk caps, the game is won by flipping the other player's card. The popular Korean variety show \"Running Man\" occasionally features ddakji in its missions, which may contribute to the awareness of the game in other parts of the world.\n\nIt is known in China as \"hua pian\" () (also called \"yang pian\" in northern China) and is printed on rectangular or circular cards.\n\n\n"}

It allows users to ask, answer and comment on graduate-level physics questions, post and review manuscripts from ArXiv (which lists PhysicsOverflow discussion pages among its trackbacks) and other sources, and vote on both forms of content.\n\nIn addition to the two primary forms of content, the PhysicsOverflow community also welcomes discussions on unsolved problems, and hosts a chat section for discussions on topics generally of interest to physicists and students of physics, such as those related to recent events in physics, physics academia, and the publishing process.\n\nPhysicsOverflow was started in April 2014 as a physics-equivalent of MathOverflow by Rahel Knöpfel, a physics PhD at the University of Rostock, high-school student Abhimanyu Pallavi Sudhir, and Roger Cattin, a retired professor of computer science at the University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland. The site was initially a mere question-and-answer forum, as it was started by users dissatisfied by the policies of the Physics Stack Exchange, but it was eventually expanded to include a \"Reviews\" section in October 2014.\n\nPhysicsOverflow is well-known for its liberal moderation policy and hesitation to block contributors except for spam, as reflected in the website's bill of \"user rights\". The content is largely community-moderated, much like MathOverflow, although exceptions have been recorded.<ref name=\"https://physicsoverflow.org/review\">https://physicsoverflow.org/review</ref>\n\nAlthough the site's moderation policy is publicly available as part of the moderator manual, the site has been criticised for the excessive dispersion of policy-related material, such as the FAQ, the Bill of Rights, the moderator list and the Community Moderation threads, leading to reduced transparency. In response, the site's administrators posted a bulletin of all moderation-related content on the site on the homepage.\n\nPhysicsOverflow runs Question2Answer, an open-source Q&A software, with a custom theme and several plugins and patches. Some of its plugins have been used by other Question2Answer websites, such as the Open Science Q&A and the Physics Problems Q&A.\n\nQuantcast records around 3000 monthly visitors and between 20,000 and 50,000 global page views to PhysicsOverflow every month, over half of whom are located in four countries: the United States (26.8%), India (9.2%), the United Kingdom (8.5%), and Germany (6.4%).

{"id": "7580342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7580342", "title": "Politico-media complex", "text": "Politico-media complex\n\nThe politico-media complex ( PMC, also referred to as the political-media complex ) is a name that has been given to the close, systematized, symbiotic-like network of relationships between a state's political and ruling classes, its media industry, and any interactions with or dependencies upon interest groups with other domains and agencies, such as law (and its enforcement through the police), corporations and the multinationals. The term PMC is often used to name, derogatively, the collusion between governments or individual politicians and the media industry in an attempt to manipulate rather than inform the people.\n\nThere is recent evidence to suggest that newer media portals (as opposed to those outlets of \"traditional\" mainstream media [MSM]) are turning, more readily, to using the PMC framework in critical analysis and interpretation of media behavior. One notable example of this is with regards to the Leveson Inquiry.\n\nBefore Johannes Gutenberg invented movable type in 1450, most information was delivered by town criers, ministers from the pulpit, or bartenders. Town criers spread information and news including royal edicts, police regulations, important community events and war news. These early methods of communication were often delivered by messengers on foot, and could be easily controlled by the ruling class. With the invention of the printing press news began to be spread in writing. Corantos, which were semi-regular pamphlets that reported news, are an example of the early politico-media complex. Popular in England, corantos reported mostly foreign news, as the royal government attempted to control what domestic news reached the masses. Corantos eventually would become regular periodicals that were subject to less political control, and mark one of the earlier forms of industrialized media.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference, and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers\". Most of the international papers present in the world today are national papers re-edited for a wider audience. Because of this, there can be biases based on nationality. In any publication there is some sort of bias just from what news is covered and what stories are shown at the forefront of the publication.\n\nAlthough print media in the West has suffered from declining advertising trends, many newspapers and magazines in the Middle East continue to do well. For countries in which the majority of the population does not have ready access to the Internet or television, newspapers and magazines are one of the few ways to get the news. However, the independence from political influence, and dependability of newsprint is questionable in many countries. The Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index suggests that even in many first world countries the rights of the press are not fully respected, and that the press is not completely free to investigate or criticize the government, though the situation is far worse in third world or politically unstable nations.\n\nNewspapers and magazines do have a back and forth between readers and journalists. Some studies have shown that the print media are more likely to reinforce existing political attitudes of the masses than change them.\n\nReporters Without Borders, an international non-governmental organization that promotes freedom of the press, produces an annual Press Freedom Index assessing countries' press freedom. Reporters Without Borders secretary-general Jean-François Julliard said at the release of the 2009 Press Freedom Index, \"It is disturbing to see European democracies such as France, Italy and Slovakia fall steadily in the rankings year after year [...] Europe should be setting an example as regards civil liberties. How can you condemn human rights violations abroad if you do not behave irreproachably at home? The Obama effect, which has enabled the United States to recover 16 places in the index, is not enough to reassure us.\"\n\nThe press is censored in the People's Republic of China by the Golden Shield Project, known colloquially as the Great Firewall of China. \"Reporters Without Borders\" ranks China's press situation as \"very serious,\" the worst possible ranking on their five-point scale. China's press was ranked 173rd out of 179 countries in the 2013 World Press Freedom Index. The Chinese government maintains the legal authority to censor the press, and in defense of censorship claims that the Communist party in China has the most freedom of press, since there is no wealthy minority controlling it.\n\nMiddle Eastern print media is mainly paid for by private funders, either a specific family or specific government party. Some Middle Eastern newspapers and magazines have been accused of having obvious political ties. Many countries in the Middle East and Africa have harsh government restrictions as to what can be published when, for various reasons depending on political and economic circumstances. Iran, ranked 174 out of 179 in 2013, is described as highly censored, as the Iranian government maintains strict control over much of the print and broadcast media and news websites. Reporters Without Borders has said that journalists in Israel \"enjoy real freedom of expression despite the existence of military censorship.\" However, Professor Yoram Peri of the University of Maryland has said that Israel experienced a media control crackdown as the government censors coverage of military action coverage, displaying how governments often limit press freedom during times of war. According to Reporters Without Borders in 2009, Eritrea in Northern Africa is the worst ranked country for journalistic freedom. Eritrea is currently a one-party \"transitional government\" which has yet to enact its ratified constitution. Other African countries at the bottom of the 2009 Press Freedom Index include Syria (165) and Somalia (164). Both countries exhibit little journalistic freedom, and are both known for their unstable transitional governments and near constant warfare.\n\nWhere newspapers used to represent an exclusive connection between readers and advertisers, print media must now compete with the power of the entire Internet. Because of declining advertising revenue and shrinking audiences, print press has been described as declining. Today a little more than half of Americans read a newspaper every day. However, a 2004 report notes that 55 million newspapers are still sold daily in the United States, and newsprint still plays a significant role in the politico-media complex.\n\nIn addition to economic struggles and readership decline, newsprint has also struggled with losing readers' trust. Surveys have found that people tend to trust newspapers less than other news media, in part because they believe that newspaper journalists are \"isolated and out of touch\" and motivated by commercial interests. Most people believe their local and national news television stations more than their local and national newspapers. The only news medium that people trust less than newspapers is print magazines.\n\nSome have speculated that the youth today are more visually inclined, and are therefore less likely to be influenced by written political news or propaganda. One Pew Center study found that 28% of this generation read the paper on a given day, and average only 10 minutes of reading time. Harvard Professor Thomas Patterson has said: \"What's happened over time is that we have become more of a viewing nation than a reading nation, and the internet is a little of both. My sense is that, like it or not, the future of news is going to be in the electronic media, but we don't really know what that form is going to look like.\"\n\nThe early American radio industry was composed of commercial shipping companies that used radio for navigation, and amateur radio enthusiasts, who built radios at home. This mixture of military, industry and community went unregulated until the Radio Act of 1912, which required all ships to use radio communication and keep a constant radio watch, amateur users to be licensed, and began regulating the use of wavelengths for radio transmissions. This act represents one of the earliest interactions between the government and the radio media and also set a precedent for later radio legislation, including the Radio Act of 1927, which established the Federal Radio Commission and added further regulation to radio users, both commercial and amateur. Government regulation increased again with the American entrance into World War I, when President Woodrow Wilson ordered naval control of all radio stations, and ordered that amateurs cease all radio activity. Jonathan Reed Winkler, a noted WWI historian, said “It was only during World War I that the United States first came to comprehend how a strategic communications network-the collection of submarine telegraph cables, and long-distance radio stations used by a nation for diplomatic, commercial and military purposes- was vital to the global political and economic interests of a great power in the modern world.” After World War I radio was introduced to broader civilian audiences when Westinghouse released the Aeriola Jr. in 1919, and the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) released the Radiola in 1920. The Aeriola Jr. and Radiola helped established a new channel for the politico-media complex to enter into thousand of American homes. By 1919 the oldest licensed American radio station, KDKA, from Pittsburgh, PA began broadcasting regular music shows, and soon music, educational programming, sports coverage and eventually news coverage became popular. Coverage of politics quickly caught on across the countries, as stations began covering elections, and reporting news of government actions. The close politico-media complex between government and radio was finalized in 1924 when the Republican and Democratic National Conventions were covered, and candidates made eve of election speeches, the first instance of radio broadcasting that was meant to affect the American political process.\n\nThe numbers of radio users exploded, by 1935 about 2 in 3 American homes owned a radio. Politicians quickly learned to reach these huge audiences. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Fireside Chats are an example of the politico-media complex. In his series of informal broadcasts from 1933 to 1944, Roosevelt developed a comforting rapport with the American public. The Fireside Chats enabled the President to communicate directly to the public through one of the most popular media outlets of the time. Politicians would continue to use the radio in World War II, in which the radio was used primarily for news transmissions and the spread of propaganda. One example of radio propaganda came from Iva Toguri D'Aquino, Ruth Hayakawa, June Suyamawho, and Myrtle Lipton collectively known as Tokyo Rose. These women hosted anti-American programming intended to lower American soldiers' morale and illustrate the use of governments' use of the media to influence the public, or their enemies. However, many people, such as Iva Toguri D'Aquino and Allied prisoners of war, were forced against their will to participate in these programs and worked hard to help Allied forces.\nAfter WWII and throughout the Cold War era, Democratic nations used long-range radio waves to broadcast news into countries behind the Iron Curtain or otherwise information-compromised nations. The American international radio program, the Voice of America, founded during World War II, became a critical part of Cold War era \"public diplomacy,\" which aimed to spread democratic values, and popularize American policies abroad. In 1950, President Harry S. Truman described the Cold War conflict as a \"struggle, above all else, for the minds of men,\" which the American people would win by getting \"the real story across to people in other countries.\" in other words, embracing the politico-media complex and using it to influence foreign listeners. The Voice of America, operating under the authority of the United States Information Agency, supported programming in forty five languages, broadcasting over 400 hours of programming a week. Programming included unbiased news coverage, musical programs, and Special English broadcasts, which intended to help listeners master American English. The VOA was not alone in its international broadcasting efforts, the United States Central Intelligence Agency supported Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, both propagandist radio networks intended to incite dissent against Communism. Other nations also used international radio as propaganda, for example, Deutsche Welle, the German international radio program was a major broadcaster during the Cold War. By 1965 DW was airing 848 hours of programming to the Soviet Union and abroad and reached 5% of the USSR population weekly by 1980. Deutsche Welle's mission to “promote understanding of Germany as an independent nation with its roots in European culture and as a liberal, democratic, constitutional state based on the rule of law.” illustrates German use of the politico-media complex.\n\nThe Golden Age of Radio may have only lasted from 1935–1950, yet radio is still an active medium in the politico-media complex. Today there is extensive radio programming on politics. One notable example is the Rush Limbaugh Show, which broadcasts the political commentary of Rush Limbaugh, referred to by listeners as \"America's Truth Detector,\" the \"Doctor of Democracy,\" and the \"Most Dangerous Man in America.\" The Rush Limbaugh Show has hosted numerous politicians, illustrating that politicians still use the radio to affect public opinion and the political process. The Air America Media company, provides progressive political commentary and news coverage and has described itself as the \"most recognized progressive talk radio network, providing an independent and unfiltered voice to a grateful listening nation.\" Air America programs such as The Rachel Maddow Show, The Lionel Show, and Live in Washington with Jack Rice discuss recordings of politicians, host politicians as live guests, and act as a connection between the political classes and the media.\n\nOne of film's most powerful political and sociological forms is national cinema, for which there are entire books for individual countries and varying definitions. Through the national cinema, ideological groups within specific countries can construct and reinforce their collective identities through film, as well as the identities of foreigners.\n\nUlf Hedetoft has observed, \"In the real world of politics and influence, certain nationalisms, cultures, ideas and interpretations are more transnationally powerful, assertive and successful than others. Where the less influential ones are not necessarily less self-congratulatory, they are certainly more inward-looking and always carry the label of national specificity.\" He goes on, however, to say that these more transnationally powerful films actually become de-nationalized as a result of its \"national-cultural currency\" more widely and easily dispersed, mixing with other cultures, becoming either a \"positive admixture\" to other countries' cultures and identities or a \"model for emulation.\" He compares national cinema that undergoes such processes to English becoming a global lingua franca: the cultural sharing that results is hegemonic and the globalizing process is non-symmetrical.\n\nPropaganda is a way that politics can be represented and manipulated in film. Leif Furhammar and Folke Isaksson credit Russian producers Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin with the birth of propaganda aesthetics, for which the underlying assumption was that by manipulating cinematic images representing reality, they could manipulate spectators' concepts of reality. Documentaries can be an even more effective form of propaganda than other genre films because the form of representation claims to mirror reality, making the manipulation of an audience that much more obscured.\n\nSuch British newsreels as \"The Battle of the Somme\" of World War I were propaganda because they only showed the war from their own perspective, though it can be argued as being more honest and objective than more recent war documentaries (for they were edited without adjustments for dramatic or epic effect). Their photographers remained on their front lines, therefore presenting at least some truth. According to Furhammar and Isaksson, it was Russian filmmakers who were the \"masters of montage\" who discovered film's power to create convincing illusion with cutting, rhythmic editing, and a didactic approach.\nWhen sound became possible, documentaries have been said to become more politically powerful with the use of speakers' voices and music. In Nazi Germany, newsreels were just as important as feature films, while in Fascist Italy propaganda was mostly limited to documentaries. A comparison of the first three installments of the American series \"Why We Fight\" and the Nazi documentary \"Sieg im Westen\" (\"Victory in the West\") demonstrates how convincing even two opposing interpretations of the same events can be. The first covers years in a couple of hours but its density disguises any omission of truth while the latter manages to depict war with real images but without blood or death. The same is found in documentaries about the Spanish Civil War.\n\nFalsification of political matter in documentaries can be created by lifting shots of events other than the one being dealt with and including them in the film so that they appear to be a part of the \"reality\" it claims to represent. The House Committee on Un-American Activities, for example, did this with \"Operation Abolition\" in 1960 and Nazi newsreels depicted scenes of the Allies' defeat at Dieppe as real scenes from the Normandy invasion just a few days afterward to convince audience of the Reich's success. Audience's political affiliations can also be manipulated by actually staging the ostensibly real events as the 1944 Nazi picture \"The Führer Gives the Jews a Town\" did.\n\nWorld War II propaganda persisted 30 years after Dachau and Auschwitz such as in the thinly disguised fascist Italian film \"The Night Porter\" (1974). The film sought to legitimize the Nazis' genocide, while glorifying sadism, brutality, and machismo. What amazes Henry Giroux, as he explains in \"Breaking into the Movies,\" is that such blatant ideological messages were ignored by critics and the general public. That society may be incapable of testing the present against the past has implications for post-industrial oppression in the West and the strategies for resisting it. Despite the writings of Antonio Gramsci, Herbert Marcuse, and Paulo Freire, the majority of Americans (at least) do not recognize how important class hegemony, or cultural domination, is in nations where populations are kept obedient to governments through ideological means. He argues, \"We are not only victims in the political and material sense, but are also tied emotionally and intellectually to the prevailing ruling-class norms and values.\"\n\nThough feature forms of propaganda lack documentaries' ostensible authenticity they can retain political power because directors' resources are less limited and they can create the reality of the film. They further compensate for lack of credibility with intensity.\n\nDespite the strong patriotism and nationalism of Americans, overtly political films have never been popular in the U.S. while films that have represented politics inconspicuously (such as in the form of propaganda) have remained popular. Besides Frank Capra, no other major American filmmaker has seriously presented central themes of citizenship, participation, and responsibility in civic life amidst the complexities and corruption of the political world. While Capra sought to \"develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action\" of the individual, as Charles Lindholm and John A. Hall describe, he ultimately failed.\n\nCapra's films are characterized by the same basic formula according to which the fundamental American values of fairness and honesty are challenged by the corruption and cruelty of politics. Ronald Reagan later extensively quoted the speech made by Mr. Deeds in \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" (1936) in which he expresses his disgust with the complexities of politics and calls for individual goodness. In his next film \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", (1939) Capra reinforces the integrity and decency of the everyman who can transcend politics despite the power and crookedness of special interest groups. After the hero of \"John Doe\" realizes his need for others, he discovers and attempts to expose a fascist bidder for presidency planning to take advantage of his club support. He fails, however, in the midst of a violent mob with the depressing conclusion that the American public is a credulous crowd, susceptible to manipulation until the John Doe club members come begging his forgiveness and convince him to return to lead them.\n\nThe ending of \"John Doe\" was unsuccessful amongst audiences and critics, discouraging any more political films for Capra and no films of merit after \"It's a Wonderful Life\". Capra's ultimate fall from filmmaking and his advice that all American filmmakers should forget politics if they do not want to cut themselves in half signify the challenge filmmakers face when they attempt to criticize politics. Lindholm and Hall observe that \"the problems that defeated Capra have also undercut later attempts by American filmmakers to portray the complex relationship between individualism and citizenship in the United States\" and claim that Hollywood has instead adopted the paranoia of politics that Capra had tried to overcome. Consequently, political films in the U.S. have followed a trend of focusing on the flawed character of leaders, such a films like \"Citizen Kane\" (1940) and \"Nixon\" (1995). Otherwise, they show the corruption of power, such as in \"The Candidate\" (1972) and \"Primary Colors\" (1998). Other films, like \"A Face in a Crowd\" (1957) and \"All the King's Men\" (1949), follow the warning of \"John Doe\". \"JFK\" (1991) and \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962), on the other hand, are based on the premise that democracy is an illusion and Americans are the ignorant pawns of various conspiracies involving, for example, the collusion between the government and the media.\n\nWhile films can be overtly political they can also depoliticize and oversimplify what is inherently complex, such as class struggle. Film, as it contributes to mass culture, has been criticized for reducing the concept of class to stereotypes and predictable formulas that promote superficial understandings of ideology. Such misrepresentation and the ignorance that it promotes and perpetuates has been said to make audiences and citizens vulnerable to manipulative tactics of politicians in a reality that is complex. One of the exceptions to oversimplification and ideological flattening in cinema has been said to be \"Norma Rae\" (1979), a film that presents a truer representation than is conventional of the complexities and politics of the working-class struggle and culture at the level of everyday life.\n\nThe mass media have always influenced the political process, but never more so than with the innovation of the television. As it is the most popular means by which voters obtain information on candidates and the news in general, television is a powerful means by which political groups can influence the public.\n\nThis transformation first kicked off in the early 1960s, when newscast programs were increased to a thirty-minute programs, which allowed for greater news coverage and capacity. This expanded time slot allowed more focus to be given to presidential candidates, and network news soon became the center of national politics coverage. Because newscasts were national, the aired political campaigns were able to impact viewers across the country, enlarging the realm of influence.\n\nRick Shenkman also analyzes the media’s impact on politics in his book, \"Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter\", and observes that although American voters have gained significant political power over the last 50 years, their knowledge of politics and world affairs have decreased, which makes them more vulnerable to manipulation, and claims that \"politicians have repeatedly misled voters\" by \"dumbing down of American politics via marketing, spin machines, and misinformation.\"\nThrough setting news priorities, the news media play a significant role in determining the nation’s political reality; they provide the political information that will be regarded as fact and indicate to viewers how much importance to attach to each topic according to how much air time they dedicate to a given issue and the emphasis they place on it. For example, television news is able to offer cues on topic salience by deciding what the opening story on the newscast will be or by altering the length of time devoted a story. When these cues are repeated broadcast after broadcast, day after day, they may be able to effectively communicate the amount of importance broadcasters want each topic to have.\n\nIn his book, \"Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India,\" Arvind Rajagopal examines Hindu nationalism during the late 1980s and 1990s in India. Rajagopal analyzed the role of the media in the public's construction of national, cultural, class, and regional identity. More specifically, he studied the hegemonic role of the Ram Janmabhumi movement and how the Ram project was played out on Indian national television. In his study, Rajagopal found that the Ram project played a role in \"shaping discourses about national and cultural identities through the 1990s to the present\" in India.\n\nRajagopal investigated the cultural and political economy of television in contemporary India. His discussion of television revolves around the industrial and cultural politics of the serialized epic Ramayan. The serial epic, which generated unprecedented viewership, was based on the epic story of the Hindu god Ram and aired on Doordarshan, India's state-run television. Rajagopal made the argument that the national telecast of the Hindu religious epic Ramayan during the late 1980s provided much of the ideological groundwork for the launch of the Ram Janmabhumi movement. To defend his argument, Rajagopal stated that \"television profoundly changes the context of politics\".\n\nThe epic was broadcast on national television, sponsored by the ruling Congress government. Rajagopal argues that the Congress assumed that the mere sponsorship of the epic would aid its electoral future by bringing in the majority Hindu vote. Quite the opposite happened, however. Rather, it was the electorally weak Hindu nationalist political body, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), that benefited from the serial's popularity. The BJP did so by avoiding the media effects framework attempted by Congress and instead articulating a complex relationship between the televised Hindu epic and its own Hindu nationalist beliefs. The BJP mobilized the public around the symbol of Ram, the lead figure of the serial, but strategically reworked the symbol via the Ram Janmabhumi movement to articulate cultural authenticity, national belonging, and a renewed sense of national purpose and direction. Articulating the temple restoration project within its electoral promise, the BJP, not surprisingly, went on to form the national government in the next general election. This illustrates that, as Rajagopal argues, television is capable of profoundly impacting politics.\n\nCentral to the BJP’s success was the party's strategic use of using both the media and the market, by creating merchandise such as stickers, buttons, and audio tapes centering on the key figure of the Ram. Rajagopal argues that the televised epic also dealt with the tension between the past and the present at many levels. This can be seen in the reworking of the epic story of the Ram to fit the conventions of modern commercial television. In addition to this, the epic was laced with twenty minutes of advertising both before and after the program, which helped the serial to reconstruct the past through technologies of the present. This key fact highlights the power of advertisements in the media.\n\nIn the “Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt,” Lila Abu-Lughod suggests that a nation’s television should be studied to answer larger questions about the culture, power, and modern self-fashioning of that nation. Abu-Lughod focuses on the Egyptian nation and investigates the elements of developmentalist ideology and the dreams of national progress that dominated Egyptian television in the past. She analyzes the nation’s television broadcasts and highlights the attempt to depict authentic national culture and the intentional strategies for fighting religious extremism.\n\nThe main cultural form that binds together the Egyptian nation is, surprisingly, television serials. These serials are melodramatic programs, similar to American soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts. Their contents reflect the changing dynamics of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in the Middle Eastern nation of Egypt, while at the same time trying to influence and direct these changes.\n\nAnother group who studied the impact of television on politics included Holli Semetko and Patti Valenburg. In their studies, they analyzed the framing of press and television news in European politics. For reader clarification, they provided the best working definitions of news frames as defined from a wide range of sources. News frames are \"conceptual tools which media and individuals rely on to convey, interpret and evaluate information.\" They set the parameters \"in which citizens discuss public events.\" They are \"persistent selection, emphasis, and exclusion.\" Framing is selecting \"some aspects of a perceived reality\" to enhance their salience \"in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation.\" Frames are to help audiences \"locate, perceive, identify, and label\" the flow of information around themGoffman, 1974, p. 21 and to \"narrow the available political alternatives.\"\n\nNews frames have what is known as the framing effect. Framing effects are when relevant attributes of a message – such as its organization, content, or structure – make particular thoughts applicable, resulting in their activation and use in evaluations. Framing has shown to have large effects on people's perceptions, and has also been shown to shape public perceptions of political issues or institutions.\n\nLike agenda-setting research, framing analysis focuses on the relationship between public policy issues in the news and the public perceptions of these issues. However, framing analysis \"expands beyond agenda-setting research into what people talk or think about by examining how they think and talk about issues in the news.\" The results of Semetko and Valenburg's research indicate that the attribution of responsibility frame was most commonly employed by the news. This particular type of framing focuses on making viewers feel a sense of responsibility, in which they feel bound to perform whatever duties are attached to the given role, and feel a sense of moral accountability for not taking on the role. After understanding the attribution of responsibility frame, it is easy to see why it is such a powerful tool to news programs, as it evokes strong emotions within the viewer.\n\nThe Internet - particularly in the form of the World Wide Web (the Web) - has given the world a tool for education, communication, and negotiation in political information and political roles and its use by individuals and organizations has increased and continues to increase, greatly. This rapid increase can be compared to the boom of the television and its impact on politics as a form of media. The Internet also opens up a world of commentary and criticism which in turn allows for new and better ideas to circulate amongst many people. It gives multidirectional communication, which allows people to stay in connection with organizations or people associated with politics more easily. However, there are many controversies regarding the Internet with respect to the PMC as it (the Internet) can encourage and facilitate the practice of providing bits of information extracted from a far wider context or biased information, which leads to public cynicism toward the media.\n\nThe relative ease of entry into publishing through Internet/Web channels yields opportunities, for those so inclined, to become, in the extreme, one-person contributors/players, with a foot on both sides of the fence - politics \"and\" media - in the PMC (and sometimes information, placed into the public domain through such channels, about a political entity (politician, party etc.), being perhap less than flattering, may be 'adjusted' by one or more \"other\" entities (individuals, organizations etc.) with publishing identities that barely, if at all, conceal a relationship with the political entity in question).\nFor example, Wikipedia itself is a major global channel, currently being around the eighth most visited website, in 2009 found its objectivity being compromised at the highest levels with a 'conflict of interest' of a sitting member of the influential (ArbCom). It was shown that David Boothroyd - a serving Labour Party Councillor for Westminster City\n—had gained a seat on the Arbitration Committee under the pseudonym of the Wikipedia account 'Sam Blacketer' and also, under this name, had gone on to make controversial edits to the Wikipedia entry for the then Leader of the Opposition, later Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron. Boothroyd was also found to have operated earlier, before his appointment to the Arbitration Committee, but while an administrator, other contemporary accounts—a practice in Wikipedia known as '' - enabling the practitioner to give undue weight, through appearing as different identities, to a particular point of view as opposed to representing a neutral point of view (). Given Wikipedia's presence and influence in the world, the \"affair\" attracted mainstream media, and other new media attention nationally and internationally,\n\ncontributing damage to Wikipedia's standing along the way. Boothroyd was forced to step down from the Arbitration Committee, although he claimed he had already asserted his intention to resign.\n\nThe impact of the internet on politics has been notable, as this form of media has more current information than others since it is constantly being updated. Another advancement is its capacity to have extensive information in one place, like voting records, periodicals, press releases, opinion polls, policy statements, speeches, etc. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of an election, for example, is more convenient than it has been in the past. Political Information available on the internet covers every major activity of American politics. Users, nonetheless, remain susceptible to bias, especially on websites that represent themselves as objective sources.\nE-mail has achieved a large scale of usage amongst numerous levels of government, political groups, and even media companies as a means of communicating with the public and thus plays a significant role in the political-media complex. The boom of e-mail hit the Internet and the public in the mid-1990s as a way to keep in touch with family and friends. Different governments got a hold of this technology, and in 1993 the United States Congress and the White House were using this as communication as a means of communicating with the general public. During the Clinton administration a director for e-mail and electronic publishing was appointed and by the summer of 1993, the White House was receiving 800 e-mails per day. In order to deal with the influx of e-mail a more sophisticated system was put in. In a six-month period, at one point, there were half a million e-mails sent to the president and vice president.\n\nThe United States Presidential campaign in 1996 between sitting-President Bill Clinton and Bob Dole was one of the first campaigns to utilize the Internet on a national level in the US.\n\nWith so many campaigns using the Internet it raises a significant amount of money in a shorter period of time than with any other method. The web sites are set up like advertising sites – there are links to click on to watch ads, information and background on the candidate, photos from the campaign trail, schedules, donation links, etc. E-mail gives a great low-cost way of connecting with the campaign trail and voters.\n\nDuring the 2008 United States Presidential election between John McCain and Barack Obama, the Internet was extensively utilized by both candidates. Facebook, an Internet social network, was used heavily to give people the ability to support their views and share information with their friends. Both sent out messages daily to promote themselves and the issues at hand, for leverage against the other candidate.\n\nBlogs are a type of website, usually maintained by an individual with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or other material such as graphics or video. Blogging started to become popular at the start of the millennium, and was used mostly by highly educated, highly paid, males. Around 2004 blogging became more mainstream and was typically used for political interaction. Many political campaigns use this as a stake in monitoring blogs and actively using them to spread information about their candidate.\n\nThe Internet creates a space in which people can voice their opinions and discuss political issues under the protection of anonymity. Some discussion forums are actually groups or organizations that set up discussion for a specific purpose about one issue or person in politics. Some problems with discussion forums include the lack of personal contact, which allows people not to take responsibility for posts, such as personal attacks on others. Bias is another issue of online discussion forums because many websites attract like-minded individuals, making it less likely for alternative perspectives to be introduced.\n\nAn e-Government is a government that is inter-networked through digital technology for mass media distribution and communication for voters, taxpayers, schools, hospitals, etc. It has been described as a new way to transform government programs by closing the gap between distance and time. This idea has been said to be a more cost effective and convenient way to form programs around the needs of citizens rather than civil servants.\n\nIn perhaps what is the beginning of the first major reappraisal of the relationship between a political elite/class and the media in a major modern Western PMC, with respect to the enervation of representative political and legal processes and the consequent erosion of and dangers to the public interest in a Western democracy, is captured in excerpts from three contributions to an emergency three-hour debate conducted by members of parliament (MPs) in the Parliament of the United Kingdom on the afternoon of the 6 July 2011.\n\n\n\nThese comments refer to the apparent effects of the relationships between the members of (the UK) parliament and those that form the UK Government, the Metropolitan police and News International (NI [UK subsidiary of News Corporation ]) and the influence, expressed as malign, of the latter organization on the former two institutions.\n\nThe debate was precipitated by the type of some of the information procurement methods found to have been used by a major British Sunday newspaper (the title is now shut down) – the \"News of the World\" (was owned by NI). Now known as the (News International) ‘phone hacking affair’, the consequences for the British PMC and NI (as part of the world’s second largest media empire after The Walt Disney Company) are likely to be unfolding for some considerable time as new sectors of vulnerable members of British society subjected to the particular malicious practice are brought to light.\n\nThe Parliamentary turmoil resulted in the UK government instituting a three-pronged public judicial examination into the relations and interactions between the media and the public, the media and the police and the media and the politicians. Known as the Leveson Inquiry, its findings were published November 29, 2012 based on a spread of around eight months (November 2011 to June 2012) of probing into the relationships. While the Leveson findings are obviously oriented toward the PMC of the UK, some commentators argue that its findings will have global implications through their relevance to similar existing networks in other countries.\n\nNaming (as a 'complex') points of intersection and apparent cooperative benefit, to some degree, of diverse, nominally independent, areas of public faced activity puts us in danger of missing a much more fundamental and general insight according to linguist and dissident Noam Chomsky. Such identifiable collaborations/collusions are almost to be expected and are a natural outcome to the working of the 'industrial system,' as it has evolved in the West, having the taxpayer-funded sector at its core (that is as opposed to the contemporary conventional wisdom, with a hard and fast distinction between the state and private sectors - the economist John Kenneth Galbraith has also argued that the \"two sectors\" represent an \"innocent fraud\") and has blamed its existence on the \"socialization of costs and the privatization of profits\".\n\nChomsky discusses the \"military-industrial complex\" (MIC) and argues that its embedded behavior is not just about the \"military\" but is about ensuring that the modern economy, of which that behavior (emptied of particularly military connotations) is at the heart, is nothing much to do with freedom (of choice) or democracy either.\n\nUsing the technology of computing as a prime example, Chomsky notes that about the time Dwight Eisenhower was making his speech about the putative MIC, institutions like Harvard University and his own, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), were working, using government funds (taxpayer dollars), to reduce roomfuls of machinery into a package that could be sold as a mainframe (computer). Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like International Business Machines (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around the beginning of the 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the National Security Agency (NSA). It was about two and a half decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit, to the very people who had already paid for them.\n\nObserving the prophets of the 'free market', such as Alan Greenspan, enthusing about the 'marvels of entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choice,' Chomsky asserts, in contrast, that the contribution here during the 'costly and risky period of development' was precisely nil, almost the entire burden, without any (democratic) consultation, being placed on the taxpayer (socialized).\n\nChomsky points to the same script being followed, now, in areas such as biotechnology and neuroscience and why, from the past, we now have such 'goods' as the Internet, telecommunications, lasers etc. While it may be 'nice' to have computers (or be able to command an aircraft by 'thought') the essential point is, assuming there is some real commitment to freedom (of choice) and democracy in the elites and structures of power, given a public, such as those in the 1950s, to ask what they want out of their taxes. Computers in twenty-five years or health care, good schools and jobs today ? This assumes their being informed, in good faith, of matters.\n\nChomsky summarizes that anybody or anything deeply embedded in the interests of the industrial system, with power (such as the corporations), is 'deathly afraid' of admitting such a state of affairs and that attitudes must be manipulated towards the 'appropriate' outcomes. Such manipulation is often best done in an atmosphere of fear and under pretence of external threat.\n\nEdward S. Herman and Chomsky, together, advanced a 'propaganda model' to accomplish this '', showing the ways in which power and money filter the news and enable governments and dominant private interests to integrate the behavior of the citizenry into the structures of the industrial system. Earlier, political writer George Orwell had noted, \"All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news.\" ('Indirect censorship' obviates the need for obvious coercion.) This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.\n\nHerman and Chomsky see the ideas as being cast as testable hypotheses such that they can be held in the light of corroboration through empirical evidence and not merely as assertions out of the blue. Examination of contemporary developments in the context of the hypotheses is encouraged.\n\nThus the general and fundamental understanding of the working of the industrial system in the modern economy, 'socialization of costs and privatization of profits', is met with corroboration from the heart of the market system (often called the free market) – a contemporary and 'polite' euphemism for capitalism according to Galbraith - for example, in the near collapse of the global banking system, beginning in 2008, spreading in 2011 to the areas of sovereign debt, requiring almost constant appeal to the 'banker of last resort' - the taxpayer. Under debt restructuring, 'good debt' is returned to private hands as soon as possible and the taxpayer is left saddled with the 'bad debt' which is probably unrecoverable.\n\nThe shadow that the corporations cast on the media through advertising (corroboration of Herman and Chomsky's propaganda model filters through advertising) was illustrated in the closure of News International's 168-year-old flagship Sunday title, the \"News of the World\", when major advertisers boycotted the paper as a consequence of the 'phone hacking scandal' – the corporations, understandably, not wishing to be seen associated with a paper whose production had been based on frequent engagement in serious criminal activity.\n\nFrom Chomsky's perspective, then, whatever set of interactions is being named by the term 'politico-media complex' (PMC) simply instantiates the propaganda model to manufacture consent in the service of the industrial system.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15910459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15910459", "title": "Psychoanalysis and music", "text": "Psychoanalysis and music\n\nThe relationship between psychoanalysis and music is as old as the history of psychoanalysis itself. Psychoanalysts have examined musical phenomena, and the relationship has been reciprocal, as also musicologists have applied psychoanalysis to their work. Music therapy, too, has utilized psychoanalytic theories.\n\nSigmund Freud discussed shortly some musical phenomena in his book \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" (1900), but he was more interested in other arts, especially literature and the visual arts.\n\nFreud’s attitude toward music was ambivalent. Freud described himself as being \"ganz unmusikalisch\" (totally unmusical). Despite his much-protested resistance, he could enjoy certain operas such as \"Don Giovanni\" and \"The Marriage of Figaro\" and he used musical metaphors in the context of theory and therapy.\nFreud seemed to feel uneasy without a guide from the more rational part. To be emotionally moved by something without knowing what was moving him or why, was an intrinsically anxious experience. The operas he listened were \"conversational\" and \"narrative\" forms of music, which is theorized, provided him with some kind of \"cognitive control\" over the emotional impact of the musical sounds. Cheshire argued that maybe he was jealous and feared the potential therapeutic power of music as a rival to psychoanalysis.\n\nIt was up to other early psychoanalysts than Freud to initiate a serious psychoanalytic study of musical phenomena. First of them was the musicologist and critic Max Graf (1873–1958) who presented his views in the \"Wednesday meetings\" in 1905–1912. Among other pioneers was Desiderius (Dezső) Mosonyi (1888–1945) who published his writings in Hungarian and in German.\n\nThe early views of music were reductive and romantic: the composer expresses him- or herself directly in a musical composition; the reception of music is regressive.\n\nAfter 1950, psychoanalytical musicology started to flourish. Within a few years several studies were published by the French André Michel (1951), Ernst Kris (1952), Anton Ehrenzweig (1953), Theodor Reik (1953), and others.\n\nTheodor Reik (1888–1969) was one of Freud’s earliest students. Reik took up the theme of the \"haunting melody\" in Freud's Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1915–1917) to demonstrate, by contrast to Freud, that musical structure can represent feelings. In Reik's view, melody can convey emotion far better than words.\n\nReik showed that music is the voice of the “unknown itself” that may become compulsive in its attempt to convey a secret message. Reik speculated that the reason unconscious material sometimes emerges as a melody rather than as mere thoughts may be that melody better indicates moods and unknown feelings. He did demonstrate that songs on the mind could be effectively interacted with in a psychotherapeutic fashion in a way that helped resolve repressed conflict.\n\nThe flow of studies and articles from the latter part of the twentieth century was summarised in the two-volume essay collection \"Psychoanalytic Explorations in Music\" (1990–1993).\n\nFrom a methodological point of view, there are several approaches visible in the psychoanalytical study of music and psychoanalytically inspired musicology:\n\n\nRecent developments in cognitive neuroscience of music have led to a new way of looking at music and emotion. Neurologist Oliver Sacks states that music occupies more areas of the brain than language does, and that humans are primarily a musical species.\n\nElaborating on this idea, psychoanalyst Gilbert Rose argues that our responsiveness to music begins with the nonverbal emotional rapport of the earliest infant–parent interplay. Reaching back even further, since the fetus has an active auditory system 3–4 months before birth, the rhythm of the mothers womb and the sound of her heartbeat could be the start of our responsiveness to music. Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio states that when an organism interacts with an object, nonverbal neural images map the organism, the object and the interaction between them. As psychoanalysis gives verbal insight of non-verbal emotional involvement, and recent neurosciences found that music is able to contact this non-verbal emotions, music is stated to help the unison of thinking and feeling.\n\nAlthough psychoanalysis has had some influence on literature and cinema since the early 20th century, it is more difficult to discern whether musical compositions have been actually inspired or influenced by psychoanalysis.\n\nOne candidate has been put up by Erik W. Tawaststjerna: in his biography of Jean Sibelius, he repeatedly emphasizes the psychological and even psychoanalytical dimensions of Sibelius' Fourth Symphony (1911). According to Tawaststjerna, the Symphony reflects the psychoanalytical and introspective era when Freud and Henri Bergson stressed the meaning of the unconscious. Even Sibelius himself called his composition \"a psychological symphony\". His brother, the psychiatrist Christian Sibelius (1869–1922), was one of the first scholars to discuss psychoanalysis in Finland. According to Tawaststjerna, the Fourth Symphony is \"one of the most remarkable documents of the psychoanalytical era.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1792964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792964", "title": "Ratchet (Transformers)", "text": "Ratchet (Transformers)\n\nRatchet is a fictional robot superhero character in the Transformers robot superhero franchise. According to the original creator of the Transformers names, Bob Budiansky, Ratchet was named after the character of Nurse Ratched from the film \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". The name Ratchet is almost always portrayed as an Autobot physician and pacificist combat medic who turns into an ambulance. Ratchet is sometimes referred to by the trademarked names \"Autobot Ratchet\" or \"Rescue Ratchet.\"\n\nRatchet (Mécano in Québec, Racsni in Hungary, Храповик in Russia and Doc in Italy) is the chief medic of the Autobots in the Transformers television and comic series based on the popular toyline produced by Takara and Hasbro. His vehicle mode is an ambulance. He was named after Nurse Ratched by writer Bob Budiansky, who originally intended the character to be female, an idea rejected by Hasbro. Ratchet is well-remembered by fans of the original comic series, in which he played a major role.\n\nRatchet would transform into an ambulance (cargo van type) and was colored white with red stripes and emergency lights. Ratchet had two robot modes, though only one was usually seen in the comic run and the television cartoon. Ratchet was one of the original and the longest-lived of all Transformers in the Marvel \"Transformers\" comic series. Often a fan favorite, he was a healer first, but a soldier nonetheless. His courage and loyalty are demonstrated time and again.\n\nRatchet made his first appearance in issue #1 of the Marvel Comics \"Transformers\" comic book series. Originally this was intended to be a 4-issue series, but became a monthly series that ultimately lasted 80 issues.\n\nRatchet play prominent roles in the comic. When the rest of the Autobots are incapacitated Ratchet defeats multiple Decepticons and pushes Megatron off a cliff. Later Ratchet seemingly dies fighting Megatron but the two were later revealed to have merged. The two were separated and put into stasis before being accidentally revived. Ratchet is killed when he crashes the Ark into Earth to kill Galvatron, Megatron, and Starscream.\n\nAlthough there was no Ratchet toy for \"\", Ratchet did make several appearances in the memories of Optimus Prime in the \"Generation Two\" comic book series by Marvel Comics. Despite being dead, he would make two flashback appearances - one in his fused form with Megatron, and the other showing him protecting two humans, likely Buster Witwicky and his girlfriend Jesse.\n\nRatchet was the Autobot medic, and therefore he seldom was ever seen in battle. He usually spent time at the Autobot base with Autobot scientist Wheeljack creating and repairing other Autobots. The two of them were credited for creating the Dinobots in an attempt to bolster their ranks versus the Decepticons.\n\nRatchet was eventually killed in \"\" in an attack by the Decepticons on an Autobot shuttle. The Decepticons penetrated the hull of the shuttle that he, Ironhide, Prowl, and Brawn were flying in. Ironhide and Ratchet attacked the invaders together after Prowl and Brawn's deaths. The two suffered the same amount of fire from the Decepticons; due to Ironhide's strong armor, he survived the first strike but ultimately died. Ratchet, on the other hand, was killed easily. He is later mentioned dead by Daniel Witwicky in the Autobot Mausoleum in the season 3 episode \"Dark Awakening\". Luckily, his role as medic is taken by Junkion leader Wreck-Gar, who formed an alliance with the Autobots, and First Aid of the Protectobots.\n\nRatchet was featured in the 1985 Transformers audio books Autobots' Lightning Strike, \"Autobots Fight Back\", \"Laserbeak's Fury\" and Satellite of Doom.\n\nRatchet appeared in the 1985 story \"Autobots Fight Back\" by John Grant, published by Ladybird Books.\n\nRatchet appeared in much the same capacity as he did in the TV series, acting as the Autobots' chief medic. Joining the Autobot faction at the outbreak of the civil war, Ratchet accompanied Optimus Prime to search for survivors in part of Iacon city after Megatron had activated the planetary engines. He later remained with the Autobots under Prowl after Optimus Prime's disappearance in a Space Bridge accident.\n\nIn this reimagining of the \"Generation One\" story, the Ark was discovered by the terrorist Cobra organization, and all the Transformers inside were reformatted into Cobra vehicles remotely controlled by the Televipers. In this storyline Ratchet turned into a Cobra HiSS tank.\n\nIn the second series, he appeared as \"The Autobot\", the sole Autobot guardian of a future Earth overrun by Decepticons. This Ratchet had been changed by his experiences, ruthlessly gunning down several Decepticons and even destroying one in hand-to-hand-combat. He is located by a team of G.I. Joes trying to repair the damage done by the time-displaced Transformers. They forcibly teleported him back to Cybertron - where he was promptly gunned down by Shockwave. This Ratchet had reverted to his traditional ambulance-themed body.\n\nHe evidently survived, as he appeared again in the third series as part of the combined Autobot/G.I. Joe force attempting to rescue Optimus Prime.\n\nRatchet also appeared as a remold of Energon Towline for the \" series\". His function is Chief Medical Officer and his motto is \"You break it, I'll remake it.\"\n\nThe \"Transformers Classics\" comics published in the Official Transformers Collectors Club magazine are set in the Marvel Comics continuity, but in a timeline where the events of \"Generation 2\" did not occur. Ratchet's seemingly lifeless body appears behind Megatron's throne.\n\nRatchet oversaw the repair of Dion after he was injured battling the Combaticons.\n[ NCMANL 0508]\n\nRatchet plays a significant role in IDW's new G1 continuity. His updated form is an ambulance that bears a close resemblance to a Dodge Sprinter Van. In , he picks up three humans who have evidence of their presence on Earth, protecting them from Thundercracker and the Battlechargers. He clashes with Prowl over the issue of the humans and calling in Optimus Prime. Disobeying orders alongside Bumblebee, he is wounded in battle with Skywarp and Blitzwing (at one point being run over by the Triple Changer's tank mode), but recovers before the end of the limited series.\n\nHe reappears in the subsequent series \"\", discovering that the \"corpse\" of Sunstreaker was in fact a fake. He disobeyed orders once again to let Verity and Jimmy find the location of the decoy's manufacturer - but was interrupted by Ironhide. However, instead of stopping them, Ironhide accompanied them to find the garage that had made the \\fake Sunstreaker. However, when the two humans failed to reappear, Ironhide went in personally, while Ratchet warned him of approaching police. With Verity and Jimmy out cold, Ratchet assisted in cutting open the ceiling of hidden room they were in. While they saved the humans, Ironhide was too slow in getting out, and was destroyed by the blast.\n\nRatchet appeared in the \"New Avengers/Transformers\" crossover by Marvel Comics and IDW Publishing in 2007.\n\nOptimus Prime leads Bumblebee, Drift, Kup, Prowl, Ratchet and Wheeljack in Las Vegas when a Cybertronian ship crashes containing Galvatron, Cyclonus, Scourge and an infestation of zombies from another universe. Galvatron attempts to take command of the Autobots, and after fighting them explains his mission to stop an undead infestation. Wheeljack sets up an energy shield around the city to keep the infestation contained, but it will only last for 24 hours. Kup recognizes a Decepticon named Bayonet in Galvatron's command as not being right, and she is revealed to be the extradimensional vampire Britt.\n\nAn alternate version of Ratchet would appear in IDW's . Here he seems to be willing to follow Prowl's lead in not contacting the humans, However, when Starscream's plan is discovered Ratchet followed Bumblebee's lead in following the Decepticon train convoy, and was present at their defeat. Following this, he and the other Autobots went back into stasis.\n\nRatchet appears in the 2003 video game \"Transformers\", voiced by Jack Merluzzi.\n\nRatchet appears in the \"Robot Chicken\" episode \"Junk in the Trunk\" voiced by Seth MacFarlane. In the segment he's in, he tells Optimus that he has prostate cancer and that he will die. It turns out that it was just a segment acted out by the Autobots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatchet was the Japanese name for the character of Red Alert. This character was an obvious homage to Ratchet, being an Autobot medic who turned into an ambulance and had a tool hand, just like Generation One Ratchet was sometimes depicted with.\n\nRatchet (called Autobot Ratchet) is the name of a \"\" character. He appeared in the Universe comic book, where it was established he was Ratchet from a parallel Cybertron brought to this world when captured by Unicron, but he escaped.\n\nThis version of Ratchet appeared in the \"Transformers: Universe\" comic where it was established that he was Ratchet from a parallel Cybertron. In speaking with the Autobot Trailbreaker, it is established that in the main \"Universe\" reality Ratchet was dead.\n\nIn the 2007 live action film, Ratchet appears as a LAFD Search and Rescue Hummer H2. As always, Ratchet is the medical officer of the Autobots. According to the official movie site, Ratchet believes the conflict can be solved peacefully, without any violence. However he still carries out Optimus Prime's orders, even if it means use of force.\n\nRatchet is armed with a heavy machine gun and a saw. Ratchet also has an assortment of other tools at his disposal; in the movie, he uses a red laser to scan and try to calibrate Bumblebee's voicebox as they are introduced to Sam Witwicky and Mikaela Banes. He has an enhanced sense of smell. According to the book \"Transformers - Meet The Autobots\" by Jennifer Frantz, Ratchet has X-ray vision. According to the Transformers U.K. magazine Ratchet can produce a \"chameleon\" effect with his surface photo-electric cells allowing him to blend with his environment.\n\nThe official guide to the \"Transformers\" video game says he's 20 feet tall. The \"Transformers\" U.K. magazine states he is 20 feet 1 inch tall, weighs 6.7 tons and has a maximum speed of 230 mph. It also states he can \"haul/push 20 times his own weight\", which is 134 tons.\n\nThe vehicles used for Bumblebee, Ironhide, Jazz, and Ratchet were put on display by GM at the 2007 Detroit River Walk Festival a little over a week before the U.S. release of the film.\n\nOne early concept sketch of Ratchet shown by Hasbro at BotCon 2007 had him as a red ambulance with white and black detail. This concept was later used for the character of Inferno.\n\nIn the sequel \"\", Ratchet's color scheme is revised, sporting green and white colors with \"E4\" printed on his side panels.\n\nThe back story of the Transformers on ancient Cybertron is told in \".\" In this story Starscream returns to Cybertron after encountering an enemy scout ship in the Eshems Nebula. After being repaired for minor damage by Ratchet, Starscream and Ironhide report to Optimus Prime and Megatron.\n\nRatchet is among the Autobot forces who witness the launching of the Decepticon ship \"Nemesis\".\n\nRatchet appears in \"\" #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film. Alice steals an RV in Seattle and is chased by Skids and Mudflap, who keep her occupied until Sideswipe arrives and defeats her. She is taken to NEST headquarters on Diego Garcia to be examined by Ratchet. Sideswipe is disgusted by her decision to disguise herself as a human.\n\nRatchet tells Optimus Prime that the Autobots rescued from the Initiative will recover.\n\nNote: Events occurring in the alternate universe where Megatron won the battle of Mission City are in \"italics\".\n\nA character bio on Ratchet also revealed more of his pre-war days. Apparently a politician with a flair for cutting through bureaucracy, Ratchet was appointed as go-between for Optimus Prime and the High Council of Ancients. When war broke out Ratchet tried to act as a peacemaker, but was nearly killed by Megatron for it. Rebuilt, Ratchet served as a medical officer for the Autobots.\n\n\"In \"Twilight's Last Greaming\" part 3 Ironhide and Ratchet sneak into the Decepticon Allspark Power Distribution Hub in Savannah, Georgia disguised as Payload style drones. Although they believe the stolen code they used got them inside safely, once there they are ambushed by Bonecrusher, who says that the code didn't work and he let them in so he could fight them. In part 4 Ratchet and Ironhide continued fighting Bonecrusher in Savannah, but didn't stand much of a chance until they were joined by Arcee, Armoride and Longarm, arriving from the moon.\"\n\nRatchet appeared in the prequel novel \"\", where his personality was similar to that of G1 Ratchet. He was part of Prime's Autobot team searching for the Allspark, and was left onboard the Ark to cover the Autobots' rear in the battle, stopping Bonecrusher from entering the hangar bay. He later saved Ironhide and Jazz by opening fire and distracting the Decepticons long enough for them to get aboard. He was unable to stop Scorponok from getting aboard and sabotaging the engines, although Ratchet furiously chased the insectoid Decepticon off. In the final battle, he and Bumblebee double-teamed Barricade, but were unable to stop Starscream from destroying the human ship Ghost-1.\n\nRatchet appears as a character in the book .\n\nArriving on Earth at the same time as Optimus Prime, Jazz and Ironhide, Ratchet crash-lands outside a local diner. Ratchet quickly scans a yellow emergency Hummer H2 and re-configures his protoform to a new camouflaged form before meeting up with the other Autobots at Bumblebee's location. During the Autobots' introductions, Ratchet unintentionally embarrasses Sam in front of Mikaela, not fully understanding human social rules yet, commenting on Sam's desire to have sex with Mikeala by using his enhanced senses. The Autobots then return to Sam's house and retrieve a pair of glasses owned by Sam's great-grandfather, Captain Archibald Witwicky (the glasses have the location to the \"Allspark\" engraved on them) whilst attempting to hide from Sam's parents, which results in his mother's and father's prized gardens being destroyed by Prime's massive feet. Ratchet also accidentally gets entangled in power lines, knocking him to the ground and causing a blackout in the neighborhood. Sam finds the glasses, but before he can hand them over to the Autobots, agents of Sector 7, suddenly arrive at his home and arrest Sam and Mikaela, and later capture Bumblebee. After Bumblebee's capture, when the Autobots are discussing the location of the Allspark and their war with the Decepticons for acquiring it first, Optimus states that he intends to unite the Cube with his spark. Ratchet warns him that the Cube's raw power would destroy them both. Ratchet plays a large role in the final battle, where he, Jazz and Ironhide first battle Brawl, then assists Ironhide in providing cover for Sam against Blackout and Brawl as the latter tries to escape with the Allspark. Ratchet and Ironhide also engage Starscream, who disables both of the Autobots, leaving Sam to reach his destination building alone. Ratchet survives the battle and is seen along with Ironhide, Bumblebee, and Optimus Prime watching the sunset at the end of the film.\n\nRatchet appears in the . Ratchet first appears for a brief moment when the Autobots go back to the NEST headquarters. He arrives with the other Autobot reinforcements after Optimus's death, and is later seen with the other Autobots when they are placed under arrest. He expresses a need to leave Earth, which Ironhide objects to on behalf of Optimus. He is then seen in the battle at Egypt fighting with the soldiers against the Decepticons and, with the help of Jolt, he repairs Optimus with Jetfire's body.\n\nRatchet appears in \"\". He is first seen accompanying Optimus Prime when they arrive in Chernobyl. He is present in the meeting at the NEST base when Optimus decides to go to the moon. Optimus and Ratchet wind up on the moon and retrieve Sentinel Prime's body and his pillars from the \"Ark\" and bring them back to Earth. He is present when Optimus revives Sentinel with the Matrix of Leadership. Ratchet is also seen leaving with the rest of the Autobots on the Xantium and is present when Optimus and the rest of the Autobots return. Ratchet provides cover fire for the humans alongside Dino, Sideswipe, and Bumblebee during the final battle. He also battles Sentinel Prime alongside Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Sideswipe and is at one point seen shooting down a Decepticon that is on top of a building. When Sam calls for help after he kills Dylan Gould, Ratchet responds and shoots the Control Pillar several times before Bumblebee crashes through and destroys it. Ratchet is one of the surviving Autobots at the end of the movie, complimenting Bumblebee's bravery in battle.\n\nRatchet appears in \"\". Five years after the battle in Chicago the human governments have become fearful of all Transformers and begun hunting all of them down, forcing all of the Autobots to disband and go into hiding, Ratchet included. Ratchet is soon found by human soldiers and though he tries to escape, he is badly injured. Ratchet tries to reason with James Savoy, leader of the soldiers, but he refuses, revealing he lost a relative in Chicago. Moments later, the Cybertronian mercenary, Lockdown, working with the humans, questions Ratchet for Optimus Prime's location, but Ratchet refuses to give in, resulting in Lockdown tearing out Ratchet's spark, killing the Autobot. Later, his body is disassembled and taken to the KSI research labs for use in the production of man-made Transformers. While infiltrating the facility, Cade Yeager becomes appalled when he discovers Ratchet's head being melted for raw materials. Ratchet's death deeply affects Optimus who tries to kill the humans who were responsible. Ratchet is avenged when Optimus kills Attinger and Lockdown at the film's climax.\n\nRatchet is shown to be fighting his enemy, Lockdown.\n\nRatchet was not among the playable characters in the 2007 console Transformers game, but was playable in the Nintendo DS versions. He made a fully playable appearance in the \"Revenge of the Fallen\" video game by Activision. However, in the Nintendo DS version of the game Ratchet guides the player through training, and never appears in the game itself, other than talking to the other characters.\n\nRatchet is among the characters who appear in the \"TRANSFORMERS CYBERVERSE Battle Builder Game\".\n\nRatchet appeared in the second film's prequel novel \"Transformers: The Veiled Threat\". He was present when Somali pirates attempted to take the freighter ship he and Ironhide were traveling on, the latter of the two scaring off the pirates by transforming. He later battled the Decepticon Dropkick in at the Zambezi river in Africa, and soon saved a dam from falling by raising his external body heat high enough to repair the cracks in the dam. Some time later, he ventured to Italy and fought Deadend and Swindle, and soon took on Starscream, who as always, fled the scene soon afterward.\n\nAll toys of this character are officially licensed from General Motors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatchet appears in the \"Transformers Animated\" series.\n\nRatchet has retractable magnets in his arms which can attract or repel metal, as well as projecting a protective wall of magnetic force. The magnets can also function as rudimentary pincer claws. As of episode 7, \"Thrill of the Hunt\", Ratchet has an EMP Generator that can overload a Transformer's systems to enable him to patch them up without causing them pain, which he doesn't bring into battle until \"Transwarped\". His personality appears more based on G1's Kup than the original Ratchet. He is the oldest of the main Autobot cast of the series and the only one who actually fought against Decepticons in the Great War.\n\nIt should also be noted that he along with his toy have the same transformation and accuracy that of the G1 Trailbreaker.\n\nAs revealed in \"Thrill of the Hunt\", Ratchet was assigned by Ultra Magnus to rescue an intelligence officer, Arcee, and retrieve access codes vital to the war effort, when he ran into a Decepticon bounty hunter, Lockdown. Lockdown captured both of them, and took Ratchet's EMP Generator as a trophy. Arcee requested that Ratchet use the generator at full blast to wipe her memory, erasing the access codes in the process. Ratchet did so, but Lockdown's interference overloaded it, completely erasing Arcee's memory. Attempting to restore her memory, Ratchet accidentally uploaded the access codes Arcee was carrying. When Highbrow notices this, he has Ultra Magnus bring Ratchet before the inactive Omega Supreme, with Ratchet taking Arcee's place in teaching Omega prior to being introduced to battle. But in the aftermath of war, with Arcee still in stasis and Omega's near death in the final fight, Ratchet became the bitter war veteran that he is today.\n\nMany years later, Ratchet became the crew member of the Autobot ship that Omega's body was converted into prior to it crashing onto Earth. There, Ratchet eventually ran into Lockdown again, having him painfully remember the incident which caused Arcee to lose her memory. During the events that transpired, Ratchet retrieved his EMP Generator from Lockdown while saving Optimus Prime from him, giving him some closure. However, when Blitzwing and Lugnut came to Earth, Ratchet admitted to Sari, who was against the Autobots leaving the planet in hopes of getting the Deceptions to pursue them, that he had no intention to see someone else suffer because of their war. After being ordered later by Prime to take away Sari's key, Ratchet heads to the ship and protect the Allspark, but before he could get there, he was ambushed by Blitzwing and Lugnut, the former freezing him before ripping off most of Ratchet's right arm to get the key. After freeing himself, Ratchet reports to Optimus who tells him to enter the ship and protect the Allspark anyway. After making the ship airborne again, Ratchet managed to save Sari from Blackarachnia and then the rest of his team and Issac Sumdac, teaming up with Bumblebee and Prowl to fight Blitzwing.\n\nIn \"Garbage In, Garbage Out\", Ratchet encountered the newly created Transformer, Wreck-Gar. Initially rebuffing the scatterbrained machine, when it became clear that the trash-eating nanobots he was carrying would destroy the entire city, Ratchet was forced to do that which, in his own words, \"requires more courage than anything I've ever done in my entire Autobot career\": apologizing. Ratchet convinced Wreck-Gar that he could be anything he wanted, even a hero, and the junk-bot removed the nanobots, only to sink into the river.\n\nIn the \"A Bridge Too Close\" two-parter, Ratchet, with Sari's help, managed to bring Omega Supreme back to life, only to be saddened to see his friend once again sacrifice himself to save everyone. During \"Transwarped\", Ratchet plays a large role in the story, and is infuriated when the other Autobots \"choose\" Sari's key over him when it comes to fixing things. But after saving Bumblebee after getting severely damaged by an out-of-control Sari, Ratchet attempts talk to Omega in regaining control over himself from Starscream.\n\nIn \"Human Error\", Ratchet, along with the Autobots, are trapped in a virtual world by Soundwave. There, the Autobots take human forms. Ratchet is portrayed as a medium-built Caucasian with gray hair in his 60s.\n\nIn \"This is Why I Hate Machines\", Ratchet and Captain Fanzone arrive on Cybertron through Bulkhead's Space Bridge, just as Omega Supreme (containing Megatron, Starscream, and Lugnut) transwarps to there as well. Ratchet then fruitlessly attempts to stop Sentinel Prime from firing on his old friend, and flees the scene with Fanzone. With help from Jazz, the duo find the lair of Shockwave, who was in hiding all this time. After a duel, in which Shockwave reveals his intentions to get Omega's access codes from Arcee herself, Ratchet retells his tale to Fanzone, and battles Shockwave once more, only for Sentinel to interfere again. Shockwave escapes with Arcee, and Ratchet and Fanzone return to Earth with Ultra Magnus's hammer and Jazz, who wished no further part in Sentinel's government. Despite Perceptor assuring Ratchet that Shockwave can't get Arcee's codes, as the damage is beyond repair, on board Omega, who transwarped to the Moon, Arcee says Ratchet's name, implying she may indeed remember after all.\n\nIn the series finale, he helped facilitate Optimus's jet-pack upgrade, and later ventured to the Moon with Bulkhead, Bumblebee, and Sari. There, he and Sari returned Arcee's memories, with Arcee helping them regain control of Omega Supreme. After the battle, they all returned to Cybertron with the captured Megatron, Omega, and Prowl's body, greeted as superheroes one and all.\n\nSet shortly after the events of \"Total Meltdown\" was the \"Transformers: Animated\" comic issue #2 by IDW Publishing. In it Bumblebee and Prowl apprehended the Angry Archer as the villain attempted to steal money from a used car salesman. In doing so they revealed the holographic trickery of the Detroit super hero known as The Wraith. With the secret of his power revealed The Wraith lost much of the respect he used to command in Detroit. The Wraith attempted to stop Cyrus \"The Colossus\" Rhodes from escaping prison, but was unable to fool the villain now that the secret was public, forcing the Autobots to stop the Rhodes and making The Wraith look foolish. The Wraith then attempted to discredit Bumblebee at a college football game by trapping the Autobot with a car boot and using his holograms to make a fake Bumblebee attack the stadium. Bumblebee eventually escaped and the other Autobots helped him capture The Wraith and he was placed in a mental institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Ratchet is an evil mirror universe version of his \"Generation 1\" self. He likes to give his patients unnecessary weapon modification, whether they want it or not.\n\nAn evil version of Ratchet first appeared in the Fun Publications fiction \"Dungeons & Dinobots\". He is placed in charge of reformatting Wheeljack into an Earth-vehicle mode, then later repairs Rodimus' hand (by replacing it with a saw-weapon).\n\nAlthough not depicted directly, Ratchet is one of the many Autobots aboard the Ark in \"Do Over\". The Ark launches from Cybertron for Earth under the command of Rodimus and is followed by the Decepticon ship Nemesis, under the command of Starscream. While battling over Earth it is shot down by human defense systems.\n\nRatchet is among the Autobots on Earth in \"Blitzwing Bop\".\n\nAlthough no toy has been made for this Ratchet, his body style appears to be modeled after \"Energon\" Roadblock, but with a new head mold and sea foam green in color (similar hospital scrubs).\n\nRatchet is one of the main group of Autobots in the 2010 computer animated series \"\". His robotic appearance and attitude is similar to his Transformers Animated character.\n\nThis emergency medical truck is the Autobots' medic. Ratchet fixes limbs and gears, and he works to make do with less and less Energon. He knows Optimus Prime best, but he doesn't want the Autobots risking their necks to protect humans, or bringing them into the secret base. Deep down, though, Ratchet admires what the humans bring to the fight.\n\nOne of the few Autobots longing to return to Cybertron, Ratchet devised a version of the Space Bridge he dubbed the \"Ground Bridge,\" allowing him and the other Autobots to go anywhere around the world where a Decepticon is sighted. Out of the other Autobots, Ratchet appears to be the less thrilled about the three young humans. A running gag is him yelling \"I needed that!\" because most of his needed items get broken, mostly by Bulkhead.\n\nRatchet appears in the novel \"Transformers: Exodus\", and its sequel \"\".\n\nRatchet appears in the short story \"Bumblebee at Tyger Pax\" By Alex Irvine.\n\nRatchet appears as a playable Autobot character in the 2010 video game \"\". In the Autobot campaign, Ratchet is among the first Autobots to team up with , following the fall of Zeta Prime. Later, he is assigned to repair the liberated .\n\nIronhide and Ratchet appear in \"\" for the Nintendo DS. They are unlocked as player characters upon completing the \"Retaking Iacon\" mission.\n\nRatchet was a regularly appearing character in the \"Transformer: Prime\" animated series.\n\nIn the \"Darkness Rising\" opening five-parter, when one of his broken tools is animated into a primal Transformer, he and Optimus decide that Megatron has brought Dark Energon to Earth in order to conquer the planet with an army of the undead Cybertronians. He and Optimus go to an ancient battlefield on Earth, where Megatron mockingly refers to Ratchet as Optimus' \"trusty watchdog\", believing the old medic should've been dead a long time ago. Ratchet battles a small army of undead Cybertronians with Optimus, breaking his arm in the process as a result.\n\nAs the season goes on, Ratchet more often plays a \"tech support\" sort of role, minding the base and the ground bridge. Despite his earlier verbal hostility towards the humans, Ratchet clearly grows to care for the three children, as evidenced in \"Scrapheap\" (when he warmly pays tribute to the children's efforts in containing the swarm of Scraplets), \"Convoy\" (when he is adamantly against Jack and Miko going to fend off MECH), and \"Out of His Head\" (when he eventually relents and allows Raf to join him in finding Bumblebee). Ratchet often takes the role of leadership when Optimus isn't around (\"Scrapheap\", \"Sick Mind\"), and appears to be Optimus' best friend and second in command, declaring that he's known Optimus longer than the other members of Team Prime. By \"One Shall Fall\", he proves he has grown to fully care for the children as members of their team, when he is in despair he is at unable to treat the dark energon-infected Raf, furious that the Autobots have adopted the children into their lives, yet he knows so little of their science or medicine; stating he has \"grown to need [Raf].\" Ratchet angrily protests against not only taking the Groundbridge to the Earth's core where Unicron resides, but also allying with Megatron. Nevertheless, he obtains the necessary coordinates from Megatron, and sends Optimus, Bumblebee, Arcee, Bulkhead, and Megatron to the Earth's core, while he remains behind with Team Prime's human allies. Ratchet grimly realizes that Optimus gave the Key to Vector Sigma to Jack because he does not believe he will survive the encounter.\n\nIn the second season three-part premiere \"Orion Pax\", Ratchet decides that Optimus surrendered not only the wisdom of the Prime's when he defeated Unicron, but also his own memories, reverting to his Orion Pax persona. Ratchet informs the others of Optimus' contingency plan: download the wisdom of the Prime's to the Key to Vector Sigma from Vector Sigma itself, a task that falls to Jack as Optimus entrusted him with the relic. Ratchet takes leadership of the Autobots, and thanks to a tip from Starscream, the Autobots take and hold the Decepticons' space bridge, and fend off Megatron long enough for Jack to return with the restored Matrix of Leadership, and restore Orion Pax back to being Optimus Prime.\n\nIn the \"Operation: Bumblebee\" two-parter, Ratchet reveals to Raf that he was the field medic who saved Bumblebee's life following the scout's interrogation from Megatron, but clearly deeply regrets not being able to repair Bumblebee's voice box. In the second of two episodes, out of guilt, Ratchet decides to give his own T-cog to Bumblebee as he had no personal use for his, and to make up for not fixing Bumblebee's voice box. He chooses Arcee to perform the operation, but it is put on halt while Ratchet is in stasis, and the Autobots search for the next Iacon relic. Bumblebee also goes on a mission to attack MECH's headquarters for his T-cog, which is destroyed by Starscream. Ratchet repairs Bumblebee's T-cog as he would not accept the transplant, and to his surprise, the T-cog works, leaving Ratchet with newfound confidence in himself.\n\nDuring the search for Iacon relics, Ratchet is sent with Wheeljack to search for the Resonance Blaster. Ratchet is irritated at Wheeljack's uncouth nature and lack of respect. When Wheeljack is able to shoot Laserbeak down, Ratchet decides to take advantage of the situation and plant a virus in Laserbeak, which will allow them to download the Iacon database from the \"Nemesis\". Ratchet succeeds in the endeavor, and gains Wheeljack's respect, but his joy is cut short when Bulkhead returns mortally wounded from his mission. Ratchet is able to save Bulkhead's life, but is disgusted to learn that Wheeljack took Miko along to kill Hardshell, ruining the mutual respect they had forged. Ratchet later makes it clear he considers Wheeljack a rogue after endangering Miko in the \"revenge stunt\". Ratchet supervises Bulkhead's recovery and is later elated to learn of the Autobots' potential restoration of Cybertron. However, Optimus is forced to destroy the Omega Lock and any hope of restoring their home with it. Ratchet has an emotional breakdown, lamenting the sheer amount of losses and sacrifices they've had. The base comes under attack by Megatron, and after evacuating the team, Ratchet sets out on his own while Optimus remains behind, believing Optimus to be sacrificing himself to save the team.\n\nRatchet is initially despondent over the loss of the base, Cybertron, and Optimus, but soon rallies around Raf and Bumblebee, as they use the \"Harbinger\" as a temporary base. They are soon met by Ultra Magnus, the other Autobots (minus Smokescreen and Optimus), and their human allies. Ratchet coordinates Ultra Magnus' assault on Darkmount, and is elated to learn of Optimus' return. The Autobots are successful in destroying Darkmount and are given a new base by Agent Fowler. Ratchet assures Smokescreen that he made the right choice in depleting the Forge of Solus Prime's power to restore Optimus to life. With their Energon supplies at a critical low after the loss of their old base, Ratchet works to recreate synthetic Energon with little success. Ratchet is kidnapped by Soundwave and brought to Megatron, who asks for his aid in recreating synthetic Energon. Though Ratchet is vehemently against aiding the leader of the Decepticons, he is eventually convinced when Megatron is successful in taking advantage of his love of Cybertron, and agrees to help the Decepticons. Ratchet works with Knock Out and Shockwave, but is informed of the Decepticons' scheme to massacre the Predacons by Knock Out. Ratchet later attempts to sabotage the synthetic Energon and escape the \"Nemesis\", but is caught and thrown to Predaking. Ratchet is nearly killed before he reveals Megatron's treachery to Predaking, who spares him and goes after Megatron. Ratchet lets the other Autobots aboard the \"Nemesis\" and fights Shockwave over control of the new Omega Lock. Ratchet is fully prepared to die and sacrifice the Omega Lock to protect humanity, but Bumblebee kills Megatron, ensuring victory for the Autobots. Though Ratchet reveals there is no way to create more synthetic Energon, the Autobots are successful in restoring Cybertron. While the other Autobots return to Cybertron, Ratchet remains behind on Earth, having grown to love the planet, deeming it where he is needed most.\n\nRatchet is soon called back to Cybertron to repair Ultra Magnus, who was wounded in battle against two new Predacons, Darksteel and Skylynx. The Autobots learn of Unicron's return in Megatron's corpse, and in the absence of both Optimus and Ultra Magnus, Ratchet encourages Bumblebee to take leadership of the team. Bumblebee requests Ratchet to stay out of the final battle against Unicron. Despite his anguished protests, Ratchet later witnesses Optimus sacrifice himself to restore the Allspark to Cybertron.\n\nRatchet has been confirmed to appear in the second season of the sequel series \"\", with Jeffery Combs reprising his role.\n\n\n\n\nRatchet was referenced in the \"\" episode \"Bumblebee to the Rescue.\" He was known by the Rescue Bots as the doctor and scientist of the Autobots. When three of the Rescue Bots were stricken down with a mysterious virus, Optimus consulted Ratchet who suggested that one of the antidotes from the Rescue Bots' ship would cure it.\n\n"}

The Festival is the charity's flagship project. \n\nThe Shakespeare Schools Festival is the world's largest youth drama festival. Schools who participate perform half-hour abridged versions of Shakespeare's plays in local, professional theatres all over the United Kingdom. Since its inception in 2000, it has worked with 250,000 young people and their teachers.\n\nParent charity Shakespeare Schools Foundation (SSF) aims to engage children through an active way of learning. The charity strives to bridge \"the attainment gap\" by boosting articulacy and confidence, as well as imparting key employability skills such as teamwork, peer leadership and critical thinking. In preparing and performing the plays participants also learn about Shakespeare's language, themes and characters. All schools are able to take part in the Festival.\n\nThe Festival began in 2000 and is now in its 17th year.\n\nIn 1995, twelve of Shakespeare’s best loved plays were abridged to half hour scripts for the S4C and BBC Wales series, . Ninety per cent of the UK's secondary schools now use the Tales as their introduction to the language and plays of Shakespeare for years 7-10 (11-15 year olds), making it BBC Education's most popular series. In 2009 the films were made available by the DCSF to all English primary schools. In summer 2013 all twelve episodes were re-released on DVD in the UK by Metrodome Group Plc. They are distributed by Shakespeare Schools Festival.\n\nIn 2000, Chris Grace, Director of Animation at S4C and Executive Producer of , and Penelope Middelboe, Series Editor of the same series, launched the Shakespeare Schools Festival. Leon Garfield's 12 abridgements for the animated series were made available by S4C to pupils and their teacher-directors from eight schools in Pembrokeshire. These secondary school students performed over two nights to sell-out audiences at the Torch Theatre, Milford Haven.\n\nOctober 2001 saw 1,800 pupils from 60 inner city London schools performing in three professional theatres. The Festival culminated in a Gala night at the West End’s Duke of York’s Theatre, which was attended by Cherie Booth QC and the Secretary of State DCMS, Tessa Jowell, who called the evening “one of the year’s cultural highlights”.\n\nWith the support of the Welsh Assembly Government, the Arts Council of Wales and Cardiff 2002, Jenny Randerson AM launched the Wales 2002 Festival in the Old Library, Cardiff on 17 September. 3,000 pupils from 100 schools across the country performed in Welsh, English or bilingually, in one of 11 professional theatres.\n\nEmbarking on a three-year cycle to cover the whole of England and Wales, the Festival was launched nationwide at a reception hosted by Cherie Booth QC at 10 Downing St.\n\n8,500 young actors from 340 schools performed in 32 theatres across the regions. Three schools were picked to perform at a private reception for the Washington state visit in Downing Street, in front of an audience which included Tom Stoppard and Philip Pullman. They went on to perform again for the Arts & Kids 'Million Kids' launch at the Hackney Empire in the presence of HRH the Prince of Wales.\n\nThe year started with a fund-raising performance at the West End’s Peacock Theatre in the presence of HRH the Prince of Wales and Festival Patron, Kwame Kwei-Armah. In the summer one of the London schools took part in the National Youth Theatre’s 'Shakespeare In The Square event', securing themselves coverage on BBC London’s regional news.\n\nDuring the Festival 10,000 pupils from 380 schools performed in 38 theatres.\n\nTom Stoppard’s abridgement of The Merchant of Venice was premiered at the Linbury Theatre, Royal Opera House by a company of 2004 Festival performers and the National Youth Theatre. During the same year the BBC invited SSF to stage a one-day Festival in 100 theatres across the UK on Sunday July 3, as the launch of their Shakespeare Season, One Night of Shakespeare. Schools performed in theatres from the Shetland Isles to Bodmin, from Enniskillen to Margate and set the model for the Festival to become fully UK-national. The event set the world record for the most people performing Shakespeare on a single day (7,104) and SSF attained a place in the Guinness Book of Records.\n\n20,000 pupils from 800 schools performed in 140 theatres.\n\nFor the first time, the Shakespeare Schools Festival is held across the entire UK between the 5–9 February 2007. 22,000 pupils from 1056 schools performed in 110 theatres.\n\nA fund-raising dinner was held at the Middle Temple, hosted by Anna Ford and Charles Dance. Cameo performances from participating schools were held at the National Theatre hosted by patron Nicholas Hytner.\n\nFebruary–March 2008 saw the launch of the Shakespeare Youth Festival (SYF), a UK-wide pilot which gave 16- to 21-year-olds the opportunity to set up their own theatre company, to direct, produce, manage, tech, market and perform their own 45 minute abridegment of a Shakespeare play. 118 groups took part in 35 theatres.\n\nShakespeare 24 (S24) was an exciting worldwide Shakespeare performance event beginning in New Zealand and ending 24 hours later in Hawaii on April 23, 2008. 65 youth groups from 35 countries staged 30 and 45 minute adaptations of Shakespeare's plays at 7pm, local time on Shakespeare’s 444th birthday. One of the best productions from SYF, Jamila Gavin's abridgement of Measure for Measure was performed by the National Youth Theatre at Playhouse in Liverpool. The event was appraised by Phil Redmond, director of Liverpool, European Capital of Culture.\n\nAs part of the European Capital of Culture year SSF worked throughout Liverpool, with young companies from the Shakespeare Youth Festival performing in 33 venues and locations from museums and cathedrals to parks and bombed out churches.\n\nTo cap off a busy year, Shakespeare Schools Festival returned in the Autumn with 10,000 pupils from 500 Schools performing in 60 theatres UK-wide.\n\nSSF joined in partnership with the National Theatre (providers of the Teacher Director workshops) and the National Youth Theatre (providers of the Cast workshops). NT directors and actors such as Carl Heap, Dominic Hill, Adrian Lester, Phyllida Lloyd, Hattie Morahan joined Nicholas Hytner in giving master classes for teachers. A contemporary script based on All's Well That Ends Well, written by Lucinda Coxon, was offered by the NT to teachers who had done SSF before. Jenny Agutter appraised performances at The Unicorn Theatre, Southwark and became a festival patron.\n\n10,000 young people from 500 schools performed in 67 theatres.\n\nOver 10,000 young people from 500 schools performed in 70 theatres. Dame Harriet Walter became a patron.\n\nIn July 2011 SSF held one of its more unusual fundraising events, putting Romeo on trial for the murder of Tybalt at Gray's Inn. SSF patrons Philip Pullman and Jenny Agutter took the witness stand in the roles of Friar and Nurse. Criminal QCs for the defence included John Kelsey-Fry QC and Claire Montgomery QC.\n\nAlso in 2011 SSF ran audition workshops for 2000 young people across the UK for BBC Learning's project \"Off By Heart Shakespeare\". Eight finalists from each of the nine regions were filmed delivering their Shakespeare speeches. Festival Director, Chris Grace, whittled these down to just nine young finalists who spent three days with the RSC at Stratford before taking part in a filmed final in the main theatre at Stratford with Jeremy Paxman as host. Judges were Simon Schama, Imogen Stubbs and Sam West.\n\nFor the first time the festival is offered to primary schools, in a pilot project involving 50 primaries. In total 13,000 young people from 600 schools performed in 80 theatres. Francesca Martinez became a patron.\n\nIn 2012 SSF was invited by the British Museum education department to run workshops for secondary school students visiting the Shakespeare: staging the world exhibition.\n\n17,500 young people from 700 schools (179 primary) performed in 90 theatres. Michael Rosen and Ralph Fiennes both became patrons.\n\n25,000 young people from 1,000 schools performing in 120 theatres.\n\nIn 2015 SSF decided again to place one of Shakespeare's characters on trial. This time, Macbeth. The event was largely improvised by the actors and lawyers involved, but based on a framework written by Jonathan Myerson. The cast included Christopher Ecclestone as Macbeth, Haydn Gwynne as Lady Macbeth, David Oakes as Banquo, Patterson Joseph as MacDuff and Pippa Bennett-Warner as one of the Weird Sisters. The event interrupted the events of Shakespeare's play following the death of Duncan and placed Macbeth on trial for Murder with David, Patterson and Haydn appearing as witnesses for the prosecution and Christopher and Pippa as witnesses for the defence. The event was overseen by High Court Judge, Sir Michael Burton, the QC's were John Kelsey-Fry QC, Jonathan Laidlaw QC, Dinah Rose QC and Ian Winter QC, and the foreman of the Jury was Jeremy Paxman.\n\n27,550 young people from 1,093 schools performed abridged Shakespeare plays in 131 theatres across the UK. SSF staged performances at 10 Downing Street, in Westminster Abbey and a West End Gala and at the Queen’s 90th birthday. \n\nSSF hosted the Trial of Hamlet fundraiser. Tried by QCs in front of Lady Justice Hallett, evidence from Gertrude, played by Meera Syal, Claudius,\nplayed by Tom Conti, and Player King, played by Lee Mack, was insufficient to find Hamlet, played by John Heffernan, guilty for the murder of Polonius.

Four versions, each with their own gameplay variations, were developed and published by various companies for the Sega Game Gear, Nintendo's Game Boy, and Tiger Electronics' game.com and R-Zone consoles. Each version is based on the 1997 .\n\nThe Game Gear, Game Boy and game.com versions feature side-scrolling platform-based gameplay.\n\nIn the Game Gear version, several organizations have sent hunting teams to Isla Sorna to capture the island's dinosaurs and sell them. The player controls a hunter, who is sent to investigate the current state of the island, and to prevent the hunting teams from achieving their goal. Twelve levels are featured, each one accessed by a world map. In two of the game's later levels, the player plays as a \"Compsognathus\" rather than the hunter.\n\nIn the Game Boy version, the player's unnamed character must prevent smugglers from removing the island's dinosaurs. The game features eight levels, including jungles and a laboratory. The player's character must collect 10 objects in each level, such as dinosaur eggs, data discs, and DNA vials. The game includes a password feature, and is compatible with the Super Game Boy.\n\nIn the game.com version, the player chooses to play as either Sarah Harding or Roland Tembo. Tembo is a hunter who wants to collect dinosaur eggs and take them off the island; Harding must collect the eggs before Tembo. The game features six levels, each one divided into two sections: Game Trail and Nest Area. Each level begins with a Game Trail section, which is a three-dimensional driving mini-game. The player chooses a vehicle, such as a motorcycle or Humvee. The player must then avoid stampeding dinosaurs and road hazards such as bushes and rocks while driving forward on a road of either dirt, grass or gravel. Nest Area, the second portion of each level, plays as a side-scroller in which the player's character must avoid dinosaurs while searching for five eggs and attempting to reach the end of the level. At the end of each level is a mother dinosaur that must be defeated. Both characters use tranquilizer darts against the dinosaurs. In addition, both characters also possess their own weapon.\n\nIn the R-Zone version, the player must survive against \"Tyrannosaurus rex\", \"Triceratops\", and \"Velociraptor\" in various jungle island levels. The player can use a motorcycle and all-terrain vehicle.\n\nIn June 1997, THQ announced that it had obtained the rights to publish a video game adaptation of \"\", to be released for the Game Boy handheld console in October 1997. Later that month at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Sega announced that a separate video game adaptation of the film would be developed for the handheld Sega Game Gear console. The Game Gear version, developed by Aspect Co. and published by Sega, was released in August 1997. It was the final Game Gear video game released in North America. \n\nBy December 1997, Tiger Electronics had developed and published their own \"Lost World\" video game for their game.com handheld console. Tiger also released a version of the game for their R-Zone handheld console in 1997. THQ's version, developed by Torus Games, was released in December 1997.\n\n\"Nintendo Power\", reviewing the Game Boy version, criticized the game's dinosaur and human characters for seeming \"overly small.\" \"Nintendo Power\" wrote that the game was unnecessarily awkward because of \"poor hit detection and delayed trigger actions while using weapons.\" \"Nintendo Power\" criticized the \"Very standard\" sound effects and music, but complimented the \"nice addition\" of a password feature, and ultimately concluded that the game \"gives players an easy-to-grasp game world for some Jurassic fun. Once you get beyond the control issue, The Lost World can provide a nice escape.\"\n\nVictor Lucas of \"The Electric Playground\" reviewed the Game Boy version and stated that he was impressed with the game despite it being \"far from the quality you'd find in a Nintendo developed platform game for the Game Boy\". Lucas praised the game for its variety of dinosaurs, but criticized its simple musical score and \"irritating\" \"Compsognathus\" enemies. Lucas also noted that there was \"slippery-slidiness involved in coming to a complete stop. There will be plenty of times that you'll overstep a nasty ledge because of this. The fact that your character can grab and hang onto these ledges is a definite plus in the control department, however.\"\n\nBrett Alan Weiss of AllGame praised the graphical detail and design of the Game.com version, but wrote that the \"over-abundance of graphical content can get in the way of the action. The foreground dinosaurs oftentimes blend in with some of the shorter trees, especially when the playfield is scrolling, and the busy backgrounds only add to the confusion.[...] Even if the graphics don't confuse you, it is hard to keep the dinosaurs from killing you.\" Weiss praised the game's sound effects, but criticized its \"wimpy\" music, calling it \"lightweight for a game of this type.\" Weiss considered the game's action to be mediocre, and criticized the poor controls, while stating that the driving levels \"are largely pointless, but they look good and they are a change of pace from the standard gameplay.\"\n\nA number of other games were released under the title \"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\" for other systems, as well as an arcade game and a pinball game. These games were developed separately by different companies and featured completely different gameplay styles.\n"}

The series follows the adventures of four young men (the Monkees) trying to make a name for themselves as a rock 'n roll band. The show introduced a number of innovative new-wave film techniques to series television and won two Emmy Awards in 1967, including Outstanding Comedy Series. The program ended on Labor Day 1968 at the finish of its second season and has received a long afterlife through Saturday morning repeats (CBS and ABC) and syndication, as well as overseas broadcasts; it later enjoyed a 1980s revival, after MTV aired reruns of the program in 1986.\n\nThe series centered on the adventures of the Monkees, a struggling rock band from Los Angeles, California consisting of Micky, Davy, Michael, and Peter. The comic elements of the storyline were provided by the strange and often surreal encounters that the band would have while searching for their big break.\n\nIn the early 1960s, aspiring filmmakers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider had formed Raybert Productions and were trying to get a foot in the door in Hollywood. They were inspired by the Beatles' film \"A Hard Day's Night\" and decided to develop a television series about a fictional rock and roll group. Raybert sold the series idea to Screen Gems in April, 1965, and Paul Mazursky and Larry Tucker completed a pilot script by August entitled \"The Monkeys\". Rafelson has said that he had the idea for a TV series about a music group as early as 1960, but had a hard time interesting anyone in it until 1965, by which time rock and roll music was firmly entrenched in pop culture.\n\nTrade publications \"Daily Variety\" and \"The Hollywood Reporter\" ran an ad on September 8, 1965 seeking \"Folk & Roll Musicians-Singers for acting roles in new TV series.\" As many as 400 hopefuls showed up to be considered as one of \"4 insane boys.\" Fourteen actors from the audition pool were brought back for screen tests, and Raybert chose their final four after audience research.\n\nMicky Dolenz, son of screen actor George Dolenz, had prior screen experience under the name \"Mickey Braddock\" as the 10-year-old star of the \"Circus Boy\" series in the 1950s. He was actively auditioning for pilots at the time and was told about the Raybert project by his agent.\n\nEnglishman Davy Jones was a former jockey who had achieved some initial success on the musical stage, appearing with the cast of \"Oliver!\" on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" the night of the Beatles' live American debut. He was appearing in Columbia Pictures productions and recording for the Colpix record label and had been identified in advance as a potential star for the series.\n\nTexan Michael Nesmith's mother Bette Nesmith Graham had invented a correction fluid and founded the company that became Liquid Paper. He had served a brief stint in the U.S. Air Force and had also recorded for Colpix under the name \"Michael Blessing.\" He was the only one of The Monkees who had come for the audition based on seeing the trade magazine ad. He showed up to the audition with his laundry and impressed Rafelson and Schneider with his laid-back style and droll sense of humor. He also wore a woollen hat to keep his hair out of his eyes when he rode his motorcycle, leading to early promotional materials which nicknamed him \"Wool Hat.\" The hat remained part of Nesmith's wardrobe, but the name was dropped after the pilot.\n\nPeter Tork was recommended to Rafelson and Schneider by friend Stephen Stills at his audition. Tork was a skilled multi-instrumentalist who had performed at various Greenwich Village folk clubs before moving west, where he worked as a busboy.\n\nRafelson and Schneider wanted the style of the series to reflect avant garde film techniques—such as improvisation, quick cuts, jump cuts, breaking the fourth wall, and free-flowing, loose narratives—then being pioneered by European film directors. Each episode would contain at least one musical \"romp\" which might have nothing to do with the storyline. In retrospect, these vignettes now look very much like music videos: short, self-contained films of songs in ways that echoed the Beatles' recent ventures into promotional films for their singles. They also believed strongly in the program's ability to appeal to young people, intentionally framing the kids as heroes and the adults as heavies.\n\nRafelson and Schneider hired novice director James Frawley to teach the four actors improvisational comedy. Each of the four was given a different personality to portray: Dolenz the funny one, Nesmith the smart and serious one, Tork the naive one, and Jones the cute one. Their characters were loosely based on their real selves, with the exception of Tork, who was actually a quiet intellectual. The character types also had much in common with the respective personalities of the Beatles, with Dolenz representing the madcap attitude of John Lennon, Nesmith affecting the deadpan seriousness of George Harrison, Tork depicting the odd-man-out quality of Ringo Starr, and Jones conveying the pin-up appeal of Paul McCartney.\n\nA pilot episode was shot in San Diego and Los Angeles on a shoestring budget—in many scenes the Monkees wore their own clothes. Initial audience tests (which were just then being pioneered) produced very low responses. Rafelson then re-edited the pilot and included some of the screen tests, to better introduce the band members to viewers. (Dolenz was credited in this pilot as \"Micky Braddock.\") The re-cut pilot tested so well that NBC placed an order for two seasons of episodes. (The edited pilot was broadcast November 14, 1966, as the tenth episode of the first season, with Dolenz credited under his real last name, as for all other episodes.)\n\n\"The Monkees\" debuted September 12, 1966, on the NBC television network. The series was sponsored on alternate weeks by Kellogg's Cereals and Yardley of London.\n\nThe series was filmed by Screen Gems, and many of the same sets and props from The Three Stooges short films made by the studio were used on \"The Monkees\": A pair of pajamas with a bunny design on the front that had been worn by Curly Howard in shorts such as \"Cactus Makes Perfect\" and \"In the Sweet Pie and Pie\" were the same ones worn by Peter Tork in various episodes such as \"A Coffin Too Frequent\" and \"Monkee See, Monkee Die\".\n\nTo reduce noise on the set during filming, any of the four Monkees who was not needed in front of the cameras was locked into a converted meat locker. In DVD commentary, Tork noted that this had the added benefit of concealing any marijuana use that might be going on, although he admitted that he was the sole \"serious 'head'\" of the four of them. (In the 1980s, Tork gave up alcohol and marijuana use and has volunteered time to help people recovering from alcoholism.) In a studio outtake included in the 1990s re-release of \"Headquarters\", Nesmith quips, before launching into \"Nine Times Blue\": \"Only difference between me and Peter is I'm just \"stone\" legal.\"\n\nDue to the loosely scripted nature of the series, some episodes would come in too short for air. The producers decided to fill time with various \"extras\", including the Monkees' original screen tests and candid interviews with the group (conducted by Rafelson off-camera); these interviews usually lasted one minute, hence the frequent joke, \"We're a minute short as usual,\" though the episode \"Find the Monkees\" featured a three-minute epilogue interview (in which the Monkees gave their opinions on the then-recently-occurred Sunset Strip curfew riots). Although the early episodes contained a laugh track, which was standard practice at the time, the show eventually did not add one, and most of the episodes from Season 2 had no canned laughter. NBC later cited that as one of the reasons for canceling the series.\n\nThe theme song to \"The Monkees\", \"(Theme from) The Monkees\" (released as the single in some countries in 1967), is one of the group's most well known songs. The line \"We're the young generation, and we've got somethin' to say\" reflected the new youth counterculture and their desire to give their own opinions on world events and choosing how to live their own lives instead of abiding by the traditions and beliefs of their elders.\n\nThe Monkees resided in a two-story beach house. The address varied in different episodes.\nThe address 1334 North Beechwood Drive, Hollywood, CA was frequently given in \"16\" magazine as an address to contact Screen Gems and/or The Monkees. The front of the first floor was a combination of the living room, dining room and kitchen. In the back, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, was an alcove formed by massive floor-to-ceiling bay windows, where the Monkees kept their instruments and rehearsed songs. The walls were covered with various kitschy signs and posters, such as the \"MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL\" sign near the kitchen, the \"SCRUB UP\" sign above the kitchen sink, and the \"IN CASE OF FIRE, RUN\" sign with an arrow pointing to an old-fashioned fire extinguisher near the front door. There were also two doors in the kitchen area; one led to a bathroom, the other to Davy and Peter's bedroom. The second floor (via spiral staircase near the front door) only consisted of Micky and Mike's bedroom. By the second season, the upstairs bedroom was occupied by all four Monkees. Also \"residing\" with the Monkees was Mr. Schneider, a mannequin who dispensed philosophical advice with the pull of his cord. Mr. Schneider was named after the show's co-producer Bert Schneider and was mostly voiced by main director James Frawley. The boys also had to contend with their bad-tempered landlord Mr. Babbit, who was always yelling at them about various infractions that he thought they were responsible for or threatening to throw them out for not paying the rent.\n\nThe Monkeemobile was a modified Pontiac GTO designed and built by designer Dean Jeffries. The car featured a tilted forward split two-piece windshield, a touring car T-bucket-type convertible top, modified rear quarter panels and front fenders, exaggerated tail lamps, set of four bucket seats with an extra third row bench where the rear deck should have been, and a parachute. The front grille sported the GTO emblem.\n\n\"The Monkees\" won two Emmy Awards in 1967: Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy (James Frawley, for the episode \"Royal Flush\"). Frawley was nominated for the same award the following season (for the episode \"The Devil and Peter Tork\"). Its win for Comedy Series was considered somewhat of an upset, as it bested long-time favorites \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"Bewitched\", \"Get Smart\", and \"Hogan's Heroes\".\n\nFor the first season, in 1966, the series fared well in the ratings, bolstered by several hit records by the band. The Monkees became a huge pop culture sensation. However, the public didn't realize that the show and the band were mostly a generally manufactured television series and that the Monkees themselves did not write or perform much of their own studio music, except to provide the vocals. The only exception were their live performances. When the truth became well known, there was a large backlash by many fans and music critics. NBC responded to the backlash by retooling the show in its second season with the Monkees now writing and performing much of their own music that was much less pop-oriented. In addition, the first season's clean cut looks were replaced by more hippy looking attire. All this alienated the young fans who then deserted the group. The result was a huge decline in ratings and record sales. By 1967, NBC felt the series had run its course. Coupled with friction within the band itself, the series was cancelled in 1968. The Monkees released three more albums after the series cancellation but they did not chart well.\n\n\"The Monkees\" enjoyed a resurgence on Saturday morning/afternoon television on CBS from September 1969 to September 1972 (sponsored by General Foods' Kool-Aid), and on ABC from September 1972 to August 1973. To coincide with the releases of \"The Monkees Present\" and \"Changes\" albums during this time period, many episodes replaced the older songs with tracks from these recent releases. The 58 episodes were then sold to local markets for syndication in September 1975, where they typically appeared on independent television stations on weekday afternoons (the opening title sequence seen in the syndication package, for all 58 episodes, is from the second season of the original run).\n\nA second, massive resurgence occurred when a \"Monkees\" marathon aired on February 23, 1986 on MTV. Within months, the 58 episodes were airing regularly throughout the United States on local stations (in edited form), Nickelodeon/MTV (uncut), as well as Canada on MuchMusic. Dolenz, Tork and Jones, already reunited for a \"20th Anniversary Tour\", went from playing small clubs to stadiums as the series caught on, and the tour drew critical praise. The popularity led MTV to create a \"reboot\" version of the franchise in 1987, \"New Monkees\", but it flopped and was cancelled after a half season.\n\nThe series has aired edited versions on Antenna TV, a digital subchannel network that broadcasts classic programming from the 1950s-1990s era. IFC also picked up the series for reruns in spring 2015. FETV, a cable and satellite network, began airing the series in December of 2017. In 2018, Canadian superstation CHCH began carrying the series; the station is viewable over-the-air in portions of the United States.\n\nAlthough Rhino Records now serves as the underlying rights holder for this series (as they acquired the Monkees' music catalog, TV series and official logo from Raybert and Columbia Pictures in 1994), Sony Pictures Television remains the television distributor for syndication.\n\nThe TV show \"Miami 7\", the debut of the British 1990s pop band S Club 7, had a very similar premise. It was the second time that a manufactured band had their own TV show on American television. Likewise, the Nickelodeon sitcom \"Big Time Rush\" followed the same basic format and premise, and producers of that show acknowledged \"The Monkees\" as their primary inspiration.\n\nDolenz said in a 2007 interview on the Roe Conn radio program that, while inspiration did come from the Beatles, the band's image was not meant to be a rip-off of them. He said that the Beatles were always depicted as superstars with legions of fans, whereas the Monkees were always depicted as unsigned and struggling to make a buck. This is reflected numerous times throughout the series, such as in the pilot where Mike Nesmith is seen throwing darts at a Beatles poster, and in the episode \"Find the Monkees (The Audition)\" where the Monkees struggle to see a famous television producer who is looking for a rock act for use in commercial advertisements; in the episode \"I Was a 99-Pound Weakling\", Micky is tricked into signing onto a bogus weight-training program, but objects by noting, \"Where am I gonna get that kind of money? I'm an unemployed drummer.\" Also in a screen test, a Monkee asks what the Beatles have that they don't have. They sing \"Thirteen million dollars!\"\n\nWhen commenting on the death of Davy Jones on February 29, 2012, \"Time\" magazine contributor James Poniewozik praised the show: \"Even if the show never meant to be more than entertainment and a hit-single generator, we shouldn’t sell \"The Monkees\" short. It was far better TV than it had to be; during an era of formulaic domestic sitcoms and wacky comedies, it was a stylistically ambitious show, with a distinctive visual style, absurdist sense of humor and unusual story structure. Whatever Jones and The Monkees were meant to be, they became creative artists in their own right, and Jones’ chipper Brit-pop presence was a big reason they were able to produce work that was commercial, wholesome and yet impressively weird.\"\n\nSix two-episode VHS volumes of the television series were distributed by Musicvision/RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video between July 15, 1986 and June 25, 1987, taking advantage of the group's twentieth anniversary.\n\nOn October 17, 1995, with the Monkees' 30th anniversary looming, Rhino Home Video issued the complete series as a deluxe VHS boxed set, containing all 58 episodes, plus the pilot and the 1969 special, \"33⅓ Revolutions Per Monkee\", in a total of 21 videotapes, along with a specially created full-color photo book that tells the history of the series, information of each episode and a variety of photographs from the series. First-run issues of the set also included a limited-edition wristwatch. A few months before, on May 22, Columbia House started releasing a Collector's Edition series also collecting all 58 \"Monkees\" episodes and the 1969 special; the one exception being the unaired 1965 \"Monkees\" pilot, which was available only on Rhino's Video Box Set.\n\nRhino later released individual two-episode VHS volumes of the TV series between March 26, 1996 and April 11, 2000; it would be the last time \"The Monkees\" television show would be distributed on videocassette.\n\nIn May and November 2003, AOL Time Warner Entertainment’s Rhino Home Video released the first two seasons of the original television series on DVD for the first time. Rhino Retrovision’s first two seasons DVD releases features the video fully restored and digitally remastered from the original 35mm interpostive film prints and the audio, restored, remastered and remixed in 5.1 Dolby Digital “Rhinophonic” surround sound for superb film quality and optimal audio vitality and for superior home entertainment theater presentation. Seasons 1 and 2 were each released separately, six DVDs for Season 1 and five DVDs for Season 2. Both seasons were re-released by Eagle Rock Entertainment on Sept. 27, 2011.\n\nIn honor of The Monkees' 50th anniversary, Rhino released the complete series on Blu-ray for the very first time on July 8, 2016. It was originally scheduled for released on June 26, 2016 but was subsequently pushed back.\n\n\n"}

Her father promised that whoever made her smile could marry her, and many tried, but none succeeded.\n\nAcross the town, an honest worker worked hard for his master. At the end of the year, the master put a sack of money before him and told him to take as much as he wanted. To avoid sinning by taking too much, he took only one coin, and when he went to drink from a well, he dropped the coin and lost it. The next year, the same thing happened to him. The third year, the worker took the same amount of coin as before, but when he drank from the well, he did not lose his coin, and the other two coins floated up to him. He decided to see the world. A mouse asked him for alms; he gave him a coin. Then he did the same for a beetle and a catfish. \n\nHe came to the castle and saw the princess looking at him. This astounded him, and he fell in the mud. The mouse, the beetle, and the catfish came to his aid, and at their antics, the princess laughed. She pointed him out as the man, and when he was brought into the castle, he had been turned into a handsome man. The honest worker, now a handsome man, married the princess.\n\nMaking the princess laugh, or smile, is a common fairy tale motif of various uses. The culmination of Golden Goose and The Magic Swan, where the goose or swan causes other characters to stick to each other, is that the sight causes a princess to laugh for the first time, resulting, as in this story, in her marriage. Peruonto and the frame story of Giambattista Basile, however, combine it with a curse, caused by the angry person laughed at, to force the princess to marry someone.\n\nA Sesame Street Book Club book entitled The Sesame Street Alphabet Storybook (which interspersed different objects starting with subsequent letters into infamous stories as told by Sesame Street characters) included a quick telling of \"The Princess who Never Laughed\" using a xylophone and yo-yo's (X and Y) as props used by two people trying to make the princess laugh to no avail. It comes to end when Cookie Monster, who was lurking behind them, ate both items, which the princess did think was funny.\n\n"}

A port for Microsoft Windows was released in 2003 for the European market. It is a prequel to \"\" and was the last to follow in the series before it was rebooted by a 2008 entry in the series, called \"Turok\".\n\nThe game begins with the seer, Tarkeen, explaining the history of the Lost Lands which had, for years, been fought over by tyrannic warlords.\n\nOn Earth during the old west, Tal'Set faces off with his enemy, Captain Bruckner, and succeeds in cutting off his arm, but both of them are suddenly and inexplicably sucked into a wormhole. The wormhole opens in the jungle canopy of the Lost Land, and Tal'Set is nearly killed from the fall. He is found unconscious by the people of the River Village who call upon Tarkeen to heal him. Once healed, Tal'Set enters the jungle to fight reptilian humanoids known as the Sleg, aiming to keep them away from the Village. Tal'Set and River Village pilot Genn fly upon pterosaur-back to evict the Sleg from the jungle and destroy their airship.\n\nTal'Set reaches Tarkeen's sanctum and is told he must accept the mantle of Turok and release Tarkeen from a curse. When Tal'Set refuses, Tarkeen tells him that the Sleg had managed to reach the Village. This enrages Tal'Set which prompts him to cut through the mountains to reach the Sleg base to free the villagers and Wise Father from captivity.\n\nTal'Set proceeds to liberate the prisoners and destroy the base. Here, he learns of the existence of a human general who had ordered the attack on the village. It is also learned that the Sleg are planning to assault the human capitol, Galyana, but for their army to reach it, they must cross a giant chasm with only two known crossings. Tal'Set is sent through the thickly forested Shadowed Lands to destroy one of these crossings, an ancient bridge. The bridge is destroyed with Tal'Set upon it, but he is saved from falling by his pterosaur.\n\nTal'Set flies to the second crossing, the Suspended City, where his pterosaur is shot down. Tal'Set breaches the city and cleanses the street with his comrades, surviving the first wave of Sleg paratroopers entering the city. He breaches the Senate and saves the Senators, who tell him that the only way to stop the Slegs from cutting through the city is to destroy it. Tal'Set subsequently releases the tethers connecting the city to the Chasm walls. Tal'Set is given another pterosaur steed by the senators and escapes the falling city by flight.\n\nThe city is successfully destroyed, but the Sleg leader, Lord Tyrannus, has one more tactic to try. He unleashes the Juggernaut, an immense pair of cannons mounted upon a massive sauropod, with the aim to level Galyana. Tal'Set infiltrates and destroys the Juggernaut but before escaping is confronted by Tyrannus. The Sleg leader threatens to kill Tal'Set but is held off by Tarkeen. Tal'Set escapes again on his pterosaur and destroys one last wave of Sleg troops.\n\nWith the Sleg defeated, Tal'Set learns that the general is actually Bruckner, and begins to hunt him, seeking vengeance for his people. He finds Bruckner aboard a Tyrannosaurus rex equipped with various weapons. Tal'Set kills the animal, which traps Bruckner beneath it as it falls. Tal'Set leaves the villain alive, stating \"he does not deserve a warrior's death\". As Tal'Set leaves, Bruckner is eaten alive by a pack of Compsognathus. In the aftermath, Lord Tyrannus furiously screams at his defeat and was not mentioned or seen again.

It is side scrolling and has 2D graphics.\n\n\"Evolution\" received mixed reviews upon its release. The review aggregator Metacritic scored the Xbox version a 68 out of 100, the GameCube version a 70, the Game Boy Advance version a 72, and the PlayStation 2 version a 61. Publications such as \"Play\" magazine and Yahoo! Games praised its \"fierce energy\" and \"general violence and mayhem\". Common complaints focused on what was called a weak storyline and unimpressive AI. The PS2 version was more heavily criticized than the Nintendo GameCube, Xbox and PC versions due to poor framerates and inferior graphics.\n\nThe game's villain, Tobias Bruckner, lived on through \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"'s annual Tobias Bruckner Memorial Awards, which \"honored\" what they perceived to be the worst in video games, with categories specific to the games released in that year.\n\nAfter the release of \"Turok: Evolution\", Acclaim Studios Austin placed a small team in charge of creating a sequel.

Over 11 million guests visited the park in its opening year, making it the world's fastest amusement park to have achieved the 10 million milestone at the time. Since then, Universal Studios Japan has had approximately 8 million visitors every year. Most visitors are Japanese tourists and tourists from other Asian countries such as South Korea. It is also very popular among Western tourists and expatriates. In 2005, Goldman Sachs became the largest shareholder in Universal Studios Japan.\n\nVarious events were held in the year 2011 to celebrate the park's tenth anniversary, by which time a total of 88 million guests had cumulatively attended the park. There were 700,000 annual passport holders in June 2012 and in the 2012 fiscal year, 9.75 million guests visited the park. During the 2013 fiscal year, Universal Studios Japan received 10.5 million guests. Various factors contributed to this growth in 2013, including the opening of the backwards roller coaster \"Hollywood Dream – The Ride: Backdrop\" in March, and the \"New Amazing Adventure of Spider-Man - The Ride 4K3D\" in July, which installed new 4KHD technology, which proved to be popular among the younger generation.

{"id": "50774171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50774171", "title": "VA-11 HALL-A", "text": "VA-11 HALL-A\n\nVA-11 HALL-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action (also sometimes written as \"Valhalla\") is an indie bartender simulation video game with visual novel elements as well as cyberpunk, PC-98 and anime-inspired visuals, developed by Venezuelan studio Sukeban Games and published by Ysbryd Games for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on June 21, 2016. The PlayStation Vita port was developed by Wolfgame and published by Limited Run Games. The game puts the player in the role of a bartender at the eponymous VA-11 HALL-A, a small bar in a dystopian downtown which is said to attract the \"most fascinating\" of people. The gameplay consists of players making and serving drinks to bar attendees whilst listening to the stories and experiences of these said characters.\n\n\"VA-11 HALL-A\" contains nonlinear gameplay, with the game's plotline being influenced by the drinks the player makes and how the customers react to them. There are no dialogue options within the game, with making different drinks being the sole way to influence the direction of the story. \"VA-11 HALL-A\" features a diverse range of characters that have been described as \"average non-heroes\", with developers noting how they were based on side characters that were never truly fleshed out in movies. Over time, the player begins to know the characters well enough to infer what drinks they want, resulting in an intimate experience.\n\n\"VA-11 HALL-A\" was originally developed for the Cyberpunk Game Jam of 2014; however, Sukeban Games liked the game so much that they eventually turned it into a full game. The original planned release date of December 2014 has since been moved back multiple times due to delays, including when the developers changed the game engine. \"VA-11 HALL-A\" draws heavy influences from old PC-98 games, resulting in a retro yet futuristic look, as well as the developers' own experiences of living in a poorer country. The game's original prototype is downloadable for free on the game's official website, and players who pre-order gain access to a playable yet separate prologue. \"VA-11 HALL-A\" has garnered pre-release critical acclaim, while post-game reception was mostly favourable, with positive reception directed at its premise, cast of characters, and music. However, occasional reviewers perceived the game's dialogue as unrealistic and the gameplay as repetitive. A sequel, \"N1RV Ann-A\", is scheduled for a 2020 release.\n\n\"VA-11 HALL-A\" has been described by its developer, Sukeban Games, as a \"cyberpunk bartender action\" game, and has been described as a \"bartending simulator meets a visual novel somewhere in a cyberpunk dystopia\" by TouchArcade. In the game, the player assumes the role of a bartender at \"VA-11 HALL-A\" (pronounced Valhalla), a small dive bar in a dystopian downtown said to attract the \"most fascinating\" of clientele. Set in the year 207X, according to the game's official website, \"VA-11 HALL-A\" is described as a \"a booze em' up about waifus, technology, and post-dystopia life\", in a world where \"corporations reign supreme, all human life is infected with nanomachines designed to oppress them, and the terrifying White Knights ensure that everyone obeys the laws.\" Corruption and food shortages \"run rampant\" in Glitch City, the city where the eponymous bar is located.\n\nAt the bar, the player's interaction with the game is focused on preparing drinks based on the given instructions and then serving them to characters. However, the game's experience is primarily storytelling and dialogue-driven, since as the player serves the characters they also listen to their stories and experiences. The game also includes scenes outside the bar, such as at Jill's home where players are able to have text conversations and use apps on her phone. Players can also visit shops and buy items using money they earn while working at the bar to decorate Jill's home, as well as to pay the rent. Keeping Jill happy at home helps her stay more focused at work as well as making her more attuned to cocktail suggestions. Players find out about \"VA-11 HALL-A\"s world through the patrons of the bar and a selection of news reports on their in-game tablet computer at the outset of each day. At the start of each work day, the player creates their own music playlist for the game in the bar's jukebox.\n\nThere is no time limit for creating drinks. If a player makes a mistake whilst creating a drink, they can just reset the order and start again; thus, there is no real tension in the gameplay. Making flawless drinks gives the player more money through tips. To create a drink, there are five different ingredients that the player can mix together:\nAlthough the ingredients are fictional, mixing them together creates nonfictional cocktails as well, such as the Piledriver or Blue Fairy. To add additional variety, patrons at the bar may ask for single, multiple, or one large drink; these drinks can be served either aged or with ice. Players must also pay attention to infer what patrons actually want, which may be different from what they order. For example, a character might be feeling depressed and ask for a sweet drink, though the player instead giving them a shot of alcohol to help them forget their troubles would have a better effect. Alternately, the player may be able to make a character happy by talking to them instead of letting them feed on their alcoholism. At various points, the player can also tweak the customer's drink, such as adding Karmotrine to a cocktail that was previously non-alcoholic. In these ways, the player creates new scenarios as they advance in the game.\n\nOptional ingredients can be added to the drink, with its usage altering how much the drinker gets drunk. There are no dialogue options in \"VA-11 HALL-A\", with the only interactivity being making clients' requested drinks. Most of the time, clients tell the player exactly what they want, though some can be more cryptic, for example by asking for a certain flavour. As such, \"VA-11 HALL-A\" contains nonlinear gameplay in the form of branching storylines, though it is dependent not on traditional choices but rather through the drinks the player prepares. There also exists a recipe book where the recipes to all drinks that can be made can be looked up. Sukeban Games says that they hope the book, which was a requested feature in the game's prologue, would make the bartending \"feel more organic\", as well as allowing players to experiment.\n\nWhile the characters drink they also converse with the player. Depending on how well the player is able to recall drink recipes and create drinks to the clientele's preferences, such conversations change, as well as the overall plotline, which is relative to the player's overall competence. Designer Christopher Ortiz noted that the bartending mechanics in \"VA-11 HALL-A\" were made to deliberately \"tease the player's mind into doing things out of the box\", as opposed to \"play[ing] through [it] like a machine, always serving what the patron want[s] and never questioning what they [are] doing.\" Traditional visual dialogue options which the player could choose, however, were deliberately avoided as they interfered with the subtlety of the game.\n\nIn the process of worldbuilding, much of the details of \"VA-11 HALL-A\"s world are not found out by the player directly but instead through interacting with the characters. This is so the world is introduced in a \"readably human way\" and also more naturally, with each character contributing their own perspectives, \"providing details that are just random or obscure enough to paint a believable picture.\" The characters have their own personal story routes in the game. The player character of the game is Jill (formerly named Gillian during development), the bartender at the eponymous VA-11 HALL-A dive bar in Glitch City. Jill is a young female bartender who chose to forego an offer to work at a research institute, instead finding herself to be better suited to the \"field of alchemy\" in mixing drinks for customers at a dive bar. The game eases the player into its gameplay by letting Jill practice making drinks every morning before she heads to work. The game contains a \"colorful cast\" of regulars at the bar, including \"sex working robots, assassins, private detectives, and pop stars\", with how the player serves them having \"subtle but important effects on their lives\".\nOther characters in the game include Kim, a neurotic girl who is found passed out outside the bar one evening; Stella, a catgirl; Sei, one of the few pure-hearted and non-corrupt White Knights tasked with protecting Glitch City; as well as Deal and Betty, an android and veterinarian respectively, who work at a company whose majority of employees are \"corgi dogs, fitted with voice boxes.\" Pete Davison of MoeGamer noted how some characters in the game ridicule or parody real-life themes. For example, the corgis have prejudiced, \"even racist\" tendencies, with the \"disagreements between the different breeds of corgis who work at the company, and seeming resentment between some of the corgis and what they see as other types of dogs trying to take their jobs away from them\" mirroring real-life discrimination between humans; Betty, meanwhile, has irrational and illogical resentment of human enhancement. Davison praised these characterizations as laying bare the \"sheer ridiculousness of irrational prejudice.\" There are at least seven different endings in \"VA-11 HALL-A\" depending on how well the player gets to know the characters. To obtain these special endings for certain characters, the player must get that character's order right every time throughout the game's story. Eventually, the player gets to know a character well enough that they understand what they wish to drink in an exact moment, which leads to a \"very personal experience\" between the player and character.\n\n\"VA-11 HALL-A\" is developed by indie game developer Sukeban Games for the Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms, which were released on June 21. A PlayStation Vita port is currently in development by Wolfgame, and will be published by Limited Run Games, a publisher specialising in physical versions of digital-only titles. The game has also been rated for the PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch and Xbox One, though Wolfgame indicated that they are only interested in a Vita port at this time. Sukeban is also considering an iPhone version of the game, though that would require a changed interface. The game is designed and drawn by Christopher Ortiz, programmed and written by Fernando Damas, with accompanying music by Michael Kelly; the publisher is Ysbryd Games. \"VA-11 HALL-A\" uses the engine as the developers felt it is suitable for the game's \"bunch of crazy effects\" and is also easy to port to other platforms. Sukeban Games is also open to collaborations and have planned upcoming crossovers for \"VA-11 HALL-A\".\n\nA prologue of \"VA-11 HALL-A\" was originally developed for the Cyberpunk Game Jam of 2014; however, Sukeban liked the game so much that they eventually turned it into a full game. Ortiz noted that this was as the developers wanted to see more characters and expand on the stories of the world they built, as well as them looking for a \"good challenge design-wise\" that engages the player. The developers later retrospectively noted that the prologue also helped to \"gauge interest, get some money to fund development, and [serves as] a bonus for pre-ordering all at the same time.\" This original game jam prototype of \"VA-11 HALL-A\" is available to download for free on the game's official website. Additionally, a \"redux\" version of the prologue was also later redeveloped, serving as a free downloadable content update for the full game; it was released in February 2017. A demo of the game was playable at PAX Prime 2015, as well as at PAX East 2015, when a trailer was also shown. In the demo, the player interacts with \"Streaming-chan\", a woman who constantly streams her life on the internet. They have limited options; the player can either make her a strong drink and then pry personal information out of her, or mix her a weaker drink to keep her on her guard. The game was also showcased at EGX Rezzed 2016.\n\nThe game was first announced in August 2014 with an initial release of December, though it was later delayed multiple times, partially due to the developers changing the game engine partway through development. Players who pre-order \"VA-11 HALL-A\" gain access to a playable prologue which is independent of the actual game. The game was initially only offered on desktop platforms, though the PlayStation Vita port was later announced by Wolfgame at the Game Developers Conference 2015; where another trailer was also shown. The final release date of June 21 was confirmed by Sukeban Games for the Windows, OS X, and Linux versions of \"VA-11 HALL-A\" in early June 2016. The final trailer for the game was also released at the same time. The game's Steam and GOG.com pages were launched in mid June, alongside a blog titled \"The Augmented Eye\", a news website set inside \"VA-11 HALL-A\"s world to help tease the game and give details on its premise. Sukeban Games has also expressed interest in porting the game to Nintendo's Wii U and 3DS platforms.\n\nOrtiz said that Sukeban Games was founded when he and Damas started a blog to write about anime and video games. They eventually managed to grow a \"small but awesome\" community, which lead them to create a short dating sim for the blog's first anniversary. After enjoying the video game creation process, they decided to continue following that path. The majority of influences for \"VA-11 HALL-A\" come from old PC-98 games, because they are \"retro\" yet also \"look futuristic\"; especially \"X-Girl Cyber Punk Adventure\" which served as the blueprint for the game's aesthetic. According to Ortiz, in the 70s–90s, \"the world was under the impression that Japan was going to take over with its superior technology.\" As such, the game is set in a parallel universe where Japan did conquer the world through technology, leading to the game's strong Japanese influences. \"Blade Runner\", \"Neuromancer\", \"Ghost in the Shell\", and \"Bubblegum Crisis\" were also sources of inspiration. Anime influence has also resulted in the game's female protagonist and mostly female character list. Ortiz says that they focus their games on anime fans rather than mainstream appeal, as \"the bigger your audience is the more creative troubles you have. Too many opinions and it's hard to see one that will truly help your creative process.\"\n\n\"VA-11 HALL-A\" is also partly inspired by \"Snatcher\" and \"Policenauts\". The game's music has vaporwave influences, as well as influences from Kenji Kawai's work. Ortiz described \"VA-11 HALL-A\"s composer Michael Kelly as \"a big, BIG \"Shin Megami Tensei\" fan.\" The game's developers grew up playing PlayStation and Super Famicom games as well as watching anime; \"VA-11 HALL-A\" tries to \"make players feel what we felt when playing our favourite titles back then\", says Ortiz. Fernando Damas, writer and programmer of \"VA-11 HALL-A\", added in an interview that the game tries to make the player \"feel small\", and rather than guiding them through the basics of the plotline, the player is instead thrown into the middle of everything and only given the means of piecing together what is going on. He also remarked how the game is set in an \"ever-moving world\" where things do not wait for the player to happen, with the characters existing long before the player meeting them and their lives happen mostly off-screen. As such, the developers hoped to create a world in which the player is compelled, rather than obligated, to understand. Details of the world are not given directly to the player, and instead are revealed through intimate exchanges and conversations with the characters. Thus, according Ortiz and Damas, \"VA-11 HALLA\"s setting therefore seeks to \"humaniz[e] cyberpunk/sci-fi\".\n\n\"VA-11 HALL-A\"s developers come from Venezuela. As such, according to Ortiz, their visions of a dystopian bar scene are based on their own experiences of living in a third world country, leading them to create a cast of characters that, in the middle of a \"depressing society\", try to go on with their lives and be as happy as they can with what they already have. Tenacity in the face of difficulty can be found in every character the player interacts with in the game, where despite \"each one surviving through varying degrees of hardship, they describe their problems not with bitterness but with an undertone of perseverance\" and a certain \"burning desire to be happy\" notwithstanding their deteriorating surroundings. Damas describes Sukeban Games' titles as \"dramedies\", or a fusion of drama and comedy, as they feel it is something the game industry lacks and \"laughter in the middle of despair\" sums up their experiences of living in Venezuela. Ortiz and Damas noted that, compared to these real-life experiences, such as when a friend had to jump from rooftop to rooftop to escape the protests in San Cristóbal, \"\"VA-11 HALL-A\" is kind of tame in comparison\". Two in-game apps, the \"danger/u/\" textboard and the \"Augmented Eye\" news site, mirrors much of Venezuela's problems into the game's world. Damas explained how they wished to create a more \"optimistic kind of dystopia\", where the player is just \"a normal person living in an interesting future\". Additionally, since \"VA-11 HALL-A\" is primarily about interaction with characters, the objective of the game is not to save the world but rather to become a part of it.\n\nAccording to the game's developers, they make an effort to create and fully explore their characters before placing them into the game. After thinking of a \"cool trait or occupation\" of the character, their detailed profile is made, \"span[ning] from imagining their family life to sleeping habits to what kind of pizza toppings they might prefer.\" Although 70% of these traits are not mentioned in the game, they allow the developers to build up a mental image of the character which helps when writing about them, says \"VA-11 HALL-A\"s programmer, Fernando Damas. Before adding individual depth, the developers sought to first create a \"base\", consisting of an easily identifiable trait, for each character to curb redundancy and keep them unique. For example, \"Alma started originally as 'Christmas Cake', Stella started as 'Ojou-sama' (a young, upper-class anime stock character), and Betty as 'Grumpy Granola Girl'\". \"Non-conformity\" compared to traditional archetypes was a major factor in how Sukeban Games designed its characters, to be complex and \"not defined by one way\". Tropes were avoided; for example, Dorothy, an android sex worker, is portrayed with \"a unique kind of independence\" as opposed to \"an edgy character to make things feel more 'mature, which is the case with most other sex worker characters, according to Ortiz. \n\nTouchArcade noted that \"VA-11 HALL-A\" also has a more \"salacious side\", due to the presence of sexually suggestive character interactions that was present in the game's demo. In an interview between Ortiz and Siliconera, Ortiz said that the game also has \"waifu\" elements, inspired by the \"classic otaku getting strongly attached to a character\"; the developers sought to recreate these relationships through characterization and not so much through looks, though there are \"a fair share of beautiful people.\" In another interview between Christopher Oritz and Kill Screen, Ortiz remarked how \"this game is all about exploring what's up with the characters that you always see in the background who are never fleshed out [in movies]\", and due to this, the characters were designed to be average non-heroes; Jill, for example, was described by Ortiz as the cliche \"bartender who's always there in the background\" as opposed to a \"hero\" who is always at \"the center of the universe, with everyone else with a supporting role.\" Adding that \"you can see it as early as the premise: [the player is] not a hero, but the bartender\", Ortiz further explains that all the game's characters, from the \"[science fiction] staples like mercenaries and hackers\" to \"common folk like veterinarians, journalists, or couriers\", were deliberately made to be everyday \"people, each with their opinion and lives\", making them relatable to the player despite the futuristic setting. To help with this relatability, many of the characters and subplots in \"VA-11 HALL-A\" were based on the experiences of the developers themselves or people they know, since \"We want the characters to feel as real as possible, and what better reference for real things than reality itself?\".\n\nAdditionally, through its characters, \"VA-11 HALL-A\" challenges traditional viewpoints on affection, relationships, and friendships in video games, writes Ana Valens of Den of Geek. As such, the game's cast \"is open, honest, and affectionate towards one another\", out of necessity in getting by and surviving in a dystopian world. Ortiz and Damas attempted to infuse political allegories and social commentary into the characters and their stories without overburdening or taking focus away from the main plotline. They noted that, in most video games, \"it feels like affection is something that must be earned from scratch or something that must be justified in some way\", as well as being \"painfully underrated and deemed unnecessary in some cases\". To avoid the player feeling this way in \"VA-11 HALL-A\", Sukeban Games made the friendships between Jill and the other characters \"[something that's] come to be\", instead of something that has to be earned.\n\n\"VA-11 HALL-A\" has received very positive pre-release reception. Carter Dotson of TouchArcade found \"VA-11 HALL-A\" to be \"kind of an odd one\" and \"certainly something unique\", writing that \"I'm not completely sure what to make of it, and I'm interested to see how it works out when completed. After all, a game that's story-driven lives and dies on the quality of said story.\" He compared it to \"Her Story\" as something that could \"prove to be [...] very cool.\" This sentiment was echoed by Kyle LeClair of \"Hardcore Gamer\", writing that \"\"VA-11 Hall-A\" sure looks great and has quite a unique hook to it, so we'll be sure to try and wet our whistles with it when it comes out on the PC\". Graham Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun claimed that although \"\"VA-11 Hall-A\", whose punctuation I already resent having to type, is skirting with genres I don't care about: anime-styled visual novels\", he found \"VA-11 HALL-A\"s branching-style plotline to be more engaging that an average \"linear and relatively uninteractive\" visual novel. Rock, Paper, Shotgun also chose \"VA-11 HALL-A\" to be one of the best games shown at EGX Rezzed 2016.\n\nZack Reese of RPG Site had a \"great time\" with the game's prologue, critiquing that \"there were a lot of great touches to be had here, whether it's the anime-inspired character portraits, the fitting soundtrack that is nice to listen to even outside of context, or simply getting a permanent look of the cityscape\", though he was \"especially fascinated\" by the \"very intriguing cast of characters.\" Following \"VA-11 HALL-A\"s announcement, Brandon Orselli of Niche Gamer expressed optimism, writing \"I'm a huge fan of cyberpunk fiction, and I feel like the genre is severely neglected if not mishandled in the gaming industry. The team at Sukeban Games seem to really be paying close attention to everything they possibly can within their game's fiction, and it shines through even in this early form.\" Steven Hansen of Destructoid, whilst commenting on \"VA-11 HALL-A\", found that \"games don't always need to be bombastic save-the-world-'em-ups\", and also the game \"should be the best anime-inspired bartending sim of the year. And I don't say that lightly.\" He also added that he was \"sold\" and compared the game to \"Catherine\". Salvador GRodiles of Japanator joked that he looked forward to the \"glorious date\" and \"special joyous day\" that is \"VA-11 HALL-A\"s release date.\n\n\"PC Gamer\"s Phil Savage praised the game's character interactions, noting that \"it's through these brief, unguarded conversations that the cyberpunk bartending sim slowly unfolds its story; not of a dystopian world, but of the people living in it.\" Reviewing the game's prologue trailer, he added that \"it's an interesting concept, and well executed in what is—at this stage—a somewhat limited capacity.\" Julian Benson of Kotaku wrote that \"\"Valhalla\" is a cocktail of game genres. It draws from visual novels, with each customer who visits your bar having a different story to tell. There's a healthy measure of \"Papers, Please\", too, with you having to perform a mundane job (drink mixing) by following a complicated list of tasks. [...] And, on top of that you also get to manage and decorate your bar, so there's a dash of \"Animal Crossing\" for flavour.\" He also quipped that \"year after year, nothing seems to slow the pace of successful cyberpunk bartender simulators.\" Push Square's Nicola Hayden added that \"gaining cult success around the more niche areas of the Internet, \"VA-11 HALL-A\", a cyberpunk bartending simulator, has managed to stir up quite a fuss.\" Pete Davison of MoeGamer praised the prologue's characters, dialogue, as well as cohesion between the gameplay and storytelling, finding it to be an \"enormously interesting prospect\".\n\nKatherine Cross of Gamasutra, whilst not giving a final score, praised Jill's character as not being a traditional protagonist or \"in control of much\" in her world, the setting, as well as the \"delightfully colorful\" cast; and that \"VA-11 HALL-A\" successfully \"make[s] magic out of the mundane.\" She also explored the sexual aspects of the game, which she commended as realistic. Mike Cosimano of Destructoid awarded \"VA-11 HALL-A\" a score of 9/10, referring to it as a \"hallmark of excellence\" and complimenting the game's design, characters, as well as the \"connection\" felt between the player and the protagonist. Cecilia D'Anastasio of Kotaku echoed this sentiment, finding \"VA-11 HALL-A\" to be \"wildly impressive\" and a \"brilliant experiment in storytelling\", which is \"a must-buy for fans of interactive fiction, stylized retro games, cyberpunk and girls with cat ears – just about everybody, right?\" David Roberts of GamesRadar wrote that \"the writing [in \"VA-11 HALL-A\"] is genuinely stellar\"; he also praised the cast of \"colourful characters\" and the game's replayability. Roberts summarized it as a game \"you should be playing.\"\n\nSin Vega of Rock, Paper, Shotgun received \"VA-11 HALL-A\" generally positively. He found the writing to be \"decent\" and the characters \"generally enjoyable, even when they're not exactly likeable\", and praised the game's references to current pop-culture issues and internet climate, for example 4chan, human augmentation and manufactured pop stars. The music and gameplay were also complimented, but the game's presentation was criticised – especially the presentation of the dialogue, which only takes up a few lines per page. Caty McCarthy of Kill Screen wrote that \"VA-11 HALL-A\" \"flips the atypical ways of cyberpunk\", and lauded the game's story, which \"has heart\" as a \"story of its people, its liliths, its sentient preserved-brains, its talking dogs. It's the story of Jill and her customers, all being lost, and eventually finding their way.\" She compared it also to a good book, where \"we, the player, take[s] the backseat, and soak[s] it all in.\" A final score of 80/100 was awarded. Zack Kotzer, writing for Motherboard, compared \"VA-11 HALL-A\" to \"\"Ghost in the Shell\" meets \"Cheers\"\", and added that what makes the game engaging is that it chooses to focus on \"one very specific corner\" of a complex world, writing \"sure, there's an urban war brewing outside, but inside this [bar] is just people. Chatter about current events and politics, morality, and sex.\"\n\nHowever, PC Gamer's review was more nuanced, opining that although \"what \"Valhalla\" is trying to do is interesting\", \"playing it is boring\", with criticism directed at the repetitive nature of gameplay as well as the game's tone, which leaves a \"strange, unpleasant lingering taste in your mouth\" due to the oftentimes unrealistic dialogue, for a rating of 60/100. Much of these sentiments where echoed by Kate Gray of Eurogamer; she also praised the premise as interesting, but lamented that \"\"Valhalla\"s bartending is just boring\", with not enough player control to make the game feel creative. Adi Robertson of \"The Verge\" alleged that some reviewers found the game's sexualized dialogue from the female characters to be unrealistic. Ortiz responded that interactions were based upon their own interactions, including that \"females have always been more open about those topics than males\", but he did concede that \"we wrote ourselves into a corner by making the cast predominantly female\".\n\n\"VA-11 HALL-A\" made appearances on lists of the most anticipated video games multiple times before its release. An article by GamesRadar staff of the \"12 PAX East games we wish we were still playing\" included \"VA-11 HALL-A\"; praise was directed at the game's complexity, and how \"you can decide to give the customer the drink they ordered, flipping through the recipe book and dragging ingredients into the mixer in a simple minigame, or you can screw it up, and give them something totally different\", as well as the \"wildly different directions\" the narrative takes as a result. Similarly, Twinfinite's Matthew Byrd ranked \"VA-11 HALL-A\" first on the \"10 Anticipated Indie Games You Have to Check Out in 2016\", writing that: \"While I can honestly say that I've never specifically wished for a cyberpunk bartending game before, now that I know such a thing exists, it is all that I can think of.\" Zach Budgor of Kill Screen described \"VA-11 HALL-A\" as one of their favourite titles at Cyberpunk Game Jam 2014, describing it as \"self-styled 'cyberpunk bartender action' with detailed art and an LP's worth of bass-heavy future bangers.\" \"PC Gamer\" added \"VA-11 HALL-A\"s playable prologue to their list of \"The best free PC games\". Upon release, Thomas Faust of IndieGames.com labelled \"VA-11 HALL-A\" the best game of the year, adding \"as far as I'm concerned, the rest of 2016 can go home now. Game of the year right there, bam.\" Faust also noted that the slice of life setting of \"VA-11 HALL-A\", as well as its characters, are a departure from more conventional video game settings. Similarly, \"Gizmodo UK\" on June 25 listed \"VA-11 HALL-A\" as their top recommended video game for the week. Ana Valens of Den of Geek also listed \"VA-11 HALL-A\" as \"one of the great visual novels of 2016\", again praising the game's characters and \"powerful\" writing.\n"}

Dogs, cats, small rodents, horses, and primates all lick wounds. Saliva contains tissue factor which promotes the blood clotting mechanism. The enzyme lysozyme is found in many tissues and is known to attack the cell walls of many gram-positive bacteria, aiding in defense against infection. Tears are also beneficial to wounds due to the lysozyme enzyme. However, there are also infection risks due to bacteria in the human mouth.\n\nOral mucosa heals faster than skin, suggesting that saliva may have properties that aid wound healing. Saliva contains cell-derived tissue factor, and many compounds that are antibacterial or promote healing. Salivary tissue factor, associated with microvesicles shed from cells in the mouth, promotes wound healing through the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade. The enzymes lysozyme and peroxidase, defensins, cystatins and an antibody, IgA, are all antibacterial. Thrombospondin and some other components are antiviral. A protease inhibitor, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, is present in saliva and is both antibacterial and antiviral, and a promoter of wound healing. Nitrates that are naturally found in saliva break down into nitric oxide on contact with skin, which will inhibit bacterial growth. Saliva contains growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, VEGF, TGF-β1, leptin, IGF-I, lysophosphatidic acid, hyaluronan and NGF, which all promote healing, although levels of EGF and NGF in humans are much lower than those in rats. In humans, histatins may play a larger role. As well as being growth factors, IGF-I and TGF-α induce antimicrobial peptides. Saliva also contains an analgesic, opiorphin. Licking will also tend to debride the wound and remove gross contamination from the affected area.\nIn a recent study, scientists have confirmed through several experiments that the protein responsible for healing properties in human saliva is, in fact, histatin. Scientists are now looking for ways to make use of this information in ways that can lead to chronic wounds, burns, and injuries being healed by saliva, making this type of treatment as common as antibiotic creams and rubbing alcohol.\n\nIt has been long observed that the licking of their wounds by dogs might be beneficial. Indeed, a dog's saliva is bactericidal against the bacteria \"Escherichia coli\" and \"Streptococcus canis\", although not against coagulase positive \"Staphylococcus\" or \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\".\nWound licking is also important in other animals. Removal of the salivary glands of mice and rats slows wound healing, and communal licking of wounds among rodents accelerates wound healing. Communal licking is common in several primate species. In macaques, hair surrounding a wound and any dirt is removed, and the wound is licked, healing without infection.\n\nWound licking is beneficial but too much licking can be harmful. An Elizabethan collar may be used on pet animals to prevent them from biting an injury or excessively licking it, which can cause a lick granuloma. These lesions are often infected by pathogenic bacteria such as \"Staphylococcus intermedius\". Infection is another risk. Horses that lick wounds may become infected by a stomach parasite, \"Habronema\", a type of nematode worm. The rabies virus may be transmitted between animals, such as the kudu antelopes by wound licking of wounds with residual infectious saliva.\n\nThere are many legends involving healing wounds by licking them or applying saliva. Saint Magdalena de Pazzi is said to have cured a nun of sores and scabs in 1589 by licking her limbs. The Roman Emperor Vespasian is said to have performed a healing of a blind man using his saliva. Pliny the Elder in his Natural History reported that a fasting woman's saliva is an effective cure for bloodshot eyes.\n\nThere are potential health hazards in wound licking due to infection risk, especially in immunocompromised patients. Human saliva contains a wide variety of bacteria that are harmless in the mouth, but that may cause significant infection if introduced into a wound. A notable case was a diabetic man who licked his bleeding thumb following a minor bicycle accident, and subsequently had to have the thumb amputated after it became infected with \"Eikenella corrodens\" from his saliva. The practice of metzitzah during circumcision is controversial as it can transmit the herpes virus to the infant.\n\nDog saliva has been said by many cultures to have curative powers in people. \"\"Langue de chien, langue de médecin\" is a French saying meaning \"A dog's tongue is a doctor's tongue\"\", and a Latin quote that \"Lingua canis dum lingit vulnus curat\" or \"A dog's saliva can heal your wound\" appears in a thirteenth-century manuscript. In Ancient Greece, dogs at the shrine of Aesculapius were trained to lick patients, and snake saliva was also applied to wounds. Saint Roch in the Middle Ages was said to have been cured of a plague of sores by licking from his dog. The Assyrian Queen Semiramis is supposed to have attempted to resurrect the slain Armenian king Ara the Beautiful by having the dog god Aralez lick his wounds. In the Scottish Highlands in the nineteenth century, dog lick was believed to be effective for treating wounds and sores. In the Gospel of Luke (16:19-31), Lazarus the Beggar's sores are licked by dogs, although no curative effects are reported by the Evangelist.\n\nThere are contemporary reports of the healing properties of dog saliva. Fijian fishermen are reported to allow dogs to lick their wounds to promote healing, and a case of dog saliva promoting wound healing was reported in the \"Lancet\" medical journal.\n\nAs with the licking of wounds by people, wound licking by animals carries a risk of infection. Allowing pet cats to lick open wounds can cause cellulitis and septicemia due to bacterial infections. Licking of open wounds by dogs could transmit rabies if the dog is infected with rabies, although this is said by the CDC to be rare. Dog saliva has been reported to complicate the healing of ulcers. Another issue is the possibility of an allergy to proteins in the saliva of pets, such as Fel d 1 in cat allergy and Can f 1 in dog allergy. Cases of serious infection following the licking of wounds by pets include:\n\n\nTo \"lick your wounds\" means to \"withdraw temporarily while recovering from a defeat\"\n\nThe phrase was spoken by Antony in John Dryden's seventeenth century play \"All for Love\":\n\n"}

He first appeared in \"Yellowjacket Comics\" #1 (September 1944)\n\nYellowjacket starred in his own title, \"Yellowjacket Comics\", which was published for ten issues from 1944 to 1946. There was no artist or writer credited for the stories. These ten issues were published by \"E. Levy/Frank Comunale\", which later became Charlton. When the title was renamed \"Jack in the Box\", Yellowjacket appeared in the first issue, #11. He also appeared in \"TNT Comics\" #1, which was published by \"Charles Publications\".\n\nDue to copyright laws at the time of his inception, Yellowjacket lapsed into the public domain on the 28th anniversary of his initial published appearance.\n\nYellowjacket finally makes his DC Comics debut in Grant Morrison's The Multiversity series. He is the first superhero on Earth 4, as well as the father of the President of the United States on that Earth.\n\nYellowjacket's secret identity is crime writer, Vince Harley. After a group of jewel robbers attempted to kill him by pouring a box of yellowjackets on him, he found that he had gained the ability to control the insects, and used that ability to fight crime while wearing a yellow costume with a black and yellow striped cape resembling the markings of said insect.\n\n"}
