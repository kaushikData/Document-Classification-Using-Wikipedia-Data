Released and unreleased artworks by Luis Royo and Alfonso Azpiri reveals that the city should be a post-nuclear version of New York City.\n\nThe game consisted of two separate parts; the second half of the game was made accessible by successfully completing part one, whereupon the player is given a password (94656981).\n\nFirst part is localized in the streets of the city, and is just a sequence of fights with minor enemies and some big bosses; target is to find the entry to the city underground transport, that is in the opposed part of the map.\n\nSecond part is localized in the railways and stations of the city underground transport. Some enemies are bigger than in the first load, and more complex in design.\n\nCharacter movements were slightly different in both parts: common movements were to move left and right, to jump and to duck. While in first part the only way of fighting is using fists and legs, the second part gives the character the ability to use some kind of futuristic gun. Both loads featured some parts with two levels.\n\nSome 16-bit versions featured digitized voices. Some ports featured tricky graphical effects (e.g., the Amstrad CPC version included both mode 0 and mode 1 graphics at a time). \"After The War\" featured two of the classical \"FX\" brands of Dinamic, the FX double load (consisting on two separate parts to get advantage of computer memory) and FX giant sprites, that made use of very big sprites that can be even ¾ of the total play area height. Note that those \"FX\" brands are simply commercial names that Dinamic used to name some features of its games.\n\nThe \"giant sprites\" trick was that sprites were composed by a set of small parts that allowed reusing of those parts in different characters (e.g., a lot of enemies share the same trousers and leg movements). In some ports, a problem with the vertical sync of the monitor lets the player to easily see this trick (sometimes characters got rendered divided in two clearly different slices).\n\nA few computer magazines published notes about a coin-op version of the game that was never released outside Spain, although a coin-op of the game could be played many years ago in the Parque de Atracciones de Madrid, graphically identical to the 16-bit computers counterpart.\n\nThe cover artwork for \"After the War\" was created by artist Luis Royo. At the time development began, Spanish comic book author Alfonso Azpiri was a collaborator with Dinamic for the creation of the box art for their games. Azpiri, whose brother Jorge contributed some of the graphics for the Amstrad CPC version of \"After the War\", drew an initial version of the intended cover artwork for the game. However, due to its protracted development schedule, by the time the game was completed Azpiri had ended his collaboration with Dinamic to work with software company Topo Soft. \"After the War\" was then released with new cover art commissioned to Royo.\n\nIn 2011, nearly two decades since the dissolution of Dinamic, some of its founding members acquired the rights to distribute the Windows game \"Collapse\" in Spain and Italy under their new software company FX Interactive. The game was rebranded as \"After the War\" and marketed as belonging to the same fictional universe as the original 1989 game.\n"}

{"id": "45413337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45413337", "title": "Aquarium fishery", "text": "Aquarium fishery\n\nAquarium fishery is the process of fishing wild fish for sale to private and public aquariums.\n\nAquarium fisheries collect primarily saltwater fish, typically colorful reef fish. Major fishery areas are in the waters off the United States (Hawaii, Florida), Fiji Islands, Australia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. According to a report by the National Geographic “tens of millions of marine animals” are collected each year, more than half of them ending up in the US. It is estimated that about 1,800 species of tropical fish are collected and traded. Sea Sherpherd estimates that about 25 million fish are in the commercial pipeline of which “nearly all will die within a year from the point of capture”. Others estimates the number at 30 million animals, the vast majority coming from the Philippines and Indonesia. Aside from fish the pipeline also moves invertebrates and live corals.\n\nThe industry is largely unregulated and lacks a central data base to assess its impact upon the environment.\nDifferent fisheries are regulated or managed differently and with various degrees of oversight. For example, lack of oversight has led to the widespread use of cyanide to stun fish to collect them in the Philippines although officially it is illegal.\nWhile the US is required to monitor import of species listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) the majority of fish imported for aquariums is lumped together as marine tropical fish (MATF) by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Thus import of endangered species within this group is not monitored. The lack of an adequate database about tropical fish, - life cycle, growth and reproductive rate, population development over time - makes it difficult to monitor the impact of aquarium fisheries.\nOvercollection can be damaging to the coral reef as the example of the regal blue tang has shown. As these fish eat algae that overgrow corals, their removal endangers the health of the coral.\n\nThe Marine Aquarium Council (MAC) was an international organization formed in 1998 by stake holders including animal collectors, exporters, importers, retailers, aquarium keepers, and public aquariums, conservation organizations and government agencies. MAC recognized problems in the trade and wanted to address them. Vosseler listed them as follows:\nThe stake holders were unable to regulate the industry and MAC ceased to function due to internal disagreements in 2008.\n\nWith the lack of oversight and the danger to the environment by overfishing environmentalists have called for stricter regulation and even prohibition of the collecting of wild fish for private aquariums. Captive-bred tropical fish are readily available for hobbyists. \"In this day and age, where the ocean faces a crisis ... there's absolutely no justification for a fishery for hobby,\" indicated Mike Long of Sea Shepherd.\n\nEnvironmental efforts led Hawaii to enact some protection in the late 1990s when certain sections were closed to aquarium fisheries. There is evidence that these protective measure have been effective, but reefs are also endangered from other factors such as fertilizer run-off and coastal development.\n"}

{"id": "1317158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1317158", "title": "Blame It on Lisa", "text": "Blame It on Lisa\n\n\"Blame It on Lisa\" is the fifteenth episode of the thirteenth season of the American animated sitcom \"The Simpsons\". In the episode, the Simpson family goes to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in search of a Brazilian orphan named Ronaldo whom Lisa has been sponsoring. Lisa used to receive a letter from Ronaldo every month, but that recently stopped and according to personnel at the orphanage, he is missing. As the Simpsons search through Rio de Janeiro, Homer is kidnapped and in order to free him the family must pay a ransom of $50,000, which they do not have. Lisa soon discovers that Ronaldo has been working in a flamingo costume on the children's television series \"Teleboobies\", which is the reason he left the orphanage. Ronaldo finally meets up with the Simpsons and gives them the $50,000 they need to rescue Homer.\n\nWritten by Bob Bendetson and directed by Steven Dean Moore, \"Blame It on Lisa\" features several references to popular culture, including a parody of the Brazilian children's television host Xuxa and an allusion to the film \"A Trip to the Moon\". When it originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 31, 2002, it was seen by around eleven million people. In 2010, the episode was released on DVD and Blu-ray along with the rest of the episodes of the thirteenth season.\n\n\"Blame It on Lisa\" was controversial in Brazil because of its inclusion of clichés and stereotypes, and because the Brazilian culture was inaccurately mixed with the cultures of surrounding Latin American countries. Riotur, the tourist board of Rio de Janeiro, planned on suing Fox for damaging the international image of the city, which they thought was incorrectly portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and a rat infestation. James L. Brooks, executive producer of \"The Simpsons\", soon issued an apology to Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAs Homer and Bart are watching \"The Itchy & Scratchy Show\", Marge tells them that the telephone company has charged the family hundreds of dollars for making phone calls to Brazil. Homer and Marge decide to visit the company, thinking there has been a mistake. They meet with customer service representative Lindsey Naegle, who cuts off the family's phone service after Homer tells her that he refuses to pay the bill. Homer attempts to connect illegally to the phone lines, but only succeeds in getting electrocuted at least 5 times and, when he regains consciousness on the couch, is told that he was found \"smoldering in the bushes\". When Lisa finds out the reason the family no longer has phone service, she confesses that she has actually made calls to Brazil. She has been sponsoring an orphan named Ronaldo in the country and she used to receive a letter from him once every month until recently. Lisa called Ronaldo's orphanage to find out what had happened and she was told he is missing. She shows her family a tape recorded by Ronaldo that she received after her first donation, in which Ronaldo thanks Lisa and tells her that with her money he has purchased a pair of dancing shoes for himself and the orphanage has been able to buy a door. Touched by the tape, the Simpsons decide to travel to Brazil to solve the mystery behind Ronaldo's disappearance, leaving Maggie with Patty and Selma.\n\nWhen the family arrives in Rio de Janeiro, they discover that they can get anywhere they want by joining a conga line. After dancing their way to the hotel, Bart turns on the television in their room and watches a children's show called \"Teleboobies\" which Marge criticizes because of its sexual undertones. The Simpsons then head out to search for Ronaldo. First, they travel to the slums in Rio de Janeiro. According to Lisa, \"The government just painted them bright colors so the tourists would not be offended.\" In the slums, the family sees thousands of rats painted in various colors. They then reach Ronaldo's orphanage, but the nun working there has no idea where he has gone. Later that day, as the Simpsons are having dinner at a restaurant, Lisa shows a map on which she has marked all the places Ronaldo likes to visit. She splits the map in two, giving one piece to Homer and Bart and keeping one piece for her and Marge. Homer and Bart first search through Copacabana Beach and then a market, where they are robbed by children, while Marge and Lisa visit a samba school. However, both duos are unsuccessful in finding Ronaldo so far. To get to their last location, Homer and Bart take a taxi and are kidnapped at gunpoint by the taxi driver. However, Bart is able to get away and tell the rest of the family.\n\nThe taxi driver and his companion hold Homer hostage deep into the rainforest. They force Homer to make a phone call to Marge, telling her that if the family provides 50,000 dollars to the kidnappers, he will be released. However, the Simpsons do not have enough money so they go looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a \"Teleboobies\" float with characters from the show. Lisa is surprised to discover that Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing flamingo from \"Teleboobies\"—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing to her because he did not know which state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they need to save Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows the kidnappers a scrapbook he made of his kidnapping memories. Apparently, he has developed Stockholm syndrome. The family and the kidnappers then meet up high over a valley near the Sugarloaf Mountain in two separate cable cars. The Simpsons toss the kidnappers their money, and when Homer jumps into his family's cable car, the cables break, sending the family crashing into the mountainside and rolling down to the ground. They all survive unharmed, but Bart is then eaten whole by an anaconda. The episode ends with Bart dancing inside the snake to carnival music.\n\n\"Blame It on Lisa\" was written by Bob Bendetson and directed by Steven Dean Moore as part of the thirteenth season of \"The Simpsons\" (2001–2002). For the scenes taking place in Brazil, the animators based much of their work on photographs taken by a staff member who had previously visited the country. This episode is not the first in which the Simpsons travel to a location outside of the United States. Throughout the series, they have visited Australia, Canada, China, France, Israel, Japan, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Their visit to Brazil in \"Blame It on Lisa\" was later referenced in the eighteenth season episode \"The Wife Aquatic\" (2007), in which the family makes a trip to an island called Barnacle Bay that they discover has been devastated by overfishing. Lisa says to Bart: \"This is the most disgusting place we've ever gone,\" to which Bart asks: \"What about Brazil?\" Lisa corrects herself, responding: \"After Brazil.\"\n\nSeveral references to popular culture are included in the episode. The title \"Blame It on Lisa\" refers to the 1984 film \"Blame It on Rio\", which also takes place in Brazil. As Homer and Bart walk on Copacabana Beach, the famous 1939 song \"Aquarela do Brasil\" (also known as \"Brazil\") is played. \"Teleboobies\" is a parody of the children's television series \"Xuxa\" that attracted complaints because of the revealing outfits worn by the host, Brazilian actress and singer Xuxa. The name \"Teleboobies\" is a reference to the British television series \"Teletubbies\". The \"Itchy & Scratchy\" cartoon that Homer and Bart watch at the beginning of the episode parodies Georges Méliès' 1902 film \"A Trip to the Moon\"; Itchy and Scratchy are playing golf when Itchy hits Scratchy's head with his golf club, sending his head crashing into the Man in the Moon as the rocket does in the film. According to showrunner Al Jean, the staff members of \"The Simpsons\" asked American golfer Tiger Woods to do a guest appearance in this cartoon, but they were turned down.\n\nIn its original broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on March 31, 2002, \"Blame It on Lisa\" received a 6.3 Nielsen rating and was seen by approximately eleven million people. The episode finished forty-third in the ratings for the week of March 25–31, 2002, tying with a new episode of the comedy series \"George Lopez\" and the news program \"48 Hours\". In addition, it became the highest-rated program on Fox that week. On August 24, 2010, \"Blame It on Lisa\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Thirteenth Season\". Staff members Steven Dean Moore, Al Jean, Matt Groening, Matt Selman, Tim Long, John Frink, Don Payne, Joel H. Cohen, Matt Warburton, David Silverman, and Mike B. Anderson participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode.\n\nBendetson was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award in the animation category for his work on the episode, but lost to Ken Keeler, the writer of the \"Futurama\" episode \"Godfellas\". Reception of \"Blame It on Lisa\" from television critics has been mixed. Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com cited it as the best episode of the season. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson argued that it was not as funny as some of the other episodes that have poked fun at nations. He added that the episode \"musters the occasional laugh, and like much of [season thirteen], it’s not a bad show, but it’s not a memorable one either.\" DVD Verdict's Jennifer Malkowski cited the scrapbook Homer made of his kidnapping memories as the highlight of the episode.\n\n\"Blame It on Lisa\" was met with negative reception in Brazil shortly after its broadcast in the United States. According to \"The Washington Post\", \"an immediate media frenzy was born\" as the episode started receiving coverage in local newspapers and news programs on Brazilian television. An article published in the \"Houston Chronicle\" on April 8, 2002 stated that critics in the country were upset by the inclusion of clichés and stereotypes not related to Brazil, such as Brazilians having Spanish accents and wearing mustaches. The general Brazilian perception was that the episode mixed up their culture with that of surrounding Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. Alex Bellos, \"The Guardian\"s correspondent in Brazil, commented that one of the things upsetting the Brazilians was the many inaccuracies featured in the episode, such as the conga and the macarena being popular dances in Brazil; the conga is actually a Caribbean dance, and the macarena does not come from Brazil nor is it frequently performed there.\nOn April 6, 2002, it was reported by the Brazilian media that Riotur, the tourist board of Rio de Janeiro, was planning on suing Fox for damaging the international image of the city. Riotur stated that Rio de Janeiro was portrayed in \"Blame It on Lisa\" as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and a rat infestation, and it was thought that this would discourage foreigners from visiting the city. Over a period of three years up to the airing of \"Blame It on Lisa\" in the United States, Riotur had spent US$18 million on a campaign to attract tourists to Rio de Janeiro. The tourist board now saw this as a waste of money since they believed the campaign was undermined by the portrayal of the city in the episode. Riotur's planned lawsuit was supported by the Brazilian government, with president Fernando Henrique Cardoso stating that the episode \"brought a distorted vision of Brazilian reality\".\n\nMartin Kaste, South America correspondent for National Public Radio, reported on April 9, 2002 that since their announcement that they were going to sue Fox, the Riotur officials had been told by their lawyers in the United States that it would be difficult to sue the episode there because of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which protects parodies. \"The Simpsons\" executive producer James L. Brooks soon issued a statement saying: \"We apologize to the lovely city and people of Rio de Janeiro. And if that doesn't settle the issue, Homer Simpson offers to take on the president of Brazil on Fox's \"Celebrity Boxing\".\" Spokespersons for Fox told the press that they had not received nearly as much criticism with previous episodes that poked fun at other nations. Showrunner Al Jean has said in an interview that \"Every other place has had a good sense of humor. Brazil caught us by surprise.\" When \"Blame It on Lisa\" eventually aired in Brazil in December 2002, there was a statement at the beginning noting that Fox is not responsible for the vision of the producers behind the episode.\n\nA later episode, \"You Don't Have to Live Like a Referee\", has the family visiting Brazil again.\n\n\n"}

Among others, Bruno Mesz, Fernando Manassero, Rosa Nolly, José Rafael Subía Valdez, Virginia Chacon Dorr, Juan Marco Litrica, Roberto Maqueda, Tatiana Cuoco, Ramiro Iturrioz, Andrea Farina, Daniel Halaban, Florencia Curci, Javier Areal Velez, Rodrigo Gallegos Pinto and Lucas Giono.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2013 seventeen commissioned Works, from national and international artists, has been premiered. Among the most remarkable achievements can be listed: nine music works commissioned to new composers, six workshops for residents and external participants, six “Espiral” journal publications, and numerous digital texts. conDiT was also hosted the International Gaudeamus Competition Muziekweek (Netherlands).\n\nMany national and international musicians and ensembles participated in conDiT’s concerts, among which can be mentioned: the double-bass row from the Teatro Colón Orchestra, the French horn player Delphine Gaulthier Guiche, the cellist Martín Devoto, Manos a las Obras duo (formed by the pianist Haydée Schvartz and the violinist Elías Gurevich) Modelo62 ensemble (Netherlands), suono mobile ensemble (Córdoba, Argentina), Nonsense vocal ensemble, the experimental music duo Cilantro, the composer Martin Tellinga (Netherlands), and the Institute of Sonology of The Hague.\n\nThe events and concerts performed are closely articulated with a formative and relational instance, addressed both to the public and to the artists, and that is reflected in the multiple activities that surround the performances.\n\nFor this purpose conDiT organizes lectures, seminars, and workshops aimed to create opportunities for local and international artistas to share their experiences and knowledge. Among the most remarkable actions can be listed: Delphine Gauthier- Guiche seminar (2013- UNQUI), reConvert Project seminar(2013 - cheLA), Minka 1 (2013-cheLA) and Minka 2 (2013-cheLA).\n\nIn 2014 conDiT received two international artists in residence: the Austrian composer Christine Schorkhuber (performance and installation in March); and the Japanese composer Reiko Yamada (installation in August). The residence of German artist Noid is scheduled for December, he will present an installation and concert pieces.\n\nTransatlantic Interscores, performed in August in Vienna, was the first international conDiT concert with the participation of the Spanish percussion duo ReConvert Project.\n\nIn November conDiT produced the concert Escrituras Argentinas, with the support of the Ciclo de Música Contemporánea del Teatro General San Martín. The concert included works commissioned by the platform. The artists selected were Pablo Araya, Fernando Manassero, Luciano Azzigotti, and Valentin Pelisch.\n\nEspiral is a biannual magazine in which artists, critics, and organizers involved in conDiT manifest their reflections and reviews about the works and activities developed under the management of the platform. Some articles by authors specialized in different areas within the music field (and its relationship with other arts) are occasionally included. Espiral also works as playbill concerts, providing a reflective framework for the performances. Some of the authors who participated in Espiral are: Luciano Azzigotti, Luciano Kulikov, Ezequiel Dobrovsky, Fernando Manassero, Ezequiel Menalled, Gabriel Paiuk, Dick Raaijmakers, Martjin Tellinga, Eduardo Spinelli and .\nRelated to conDiT’s artistic proposal, the content of Espiral is based on a multidisciplinary esthetic program. This relationship is materialized through the involvement of different artists to generate de audiovisual material for each publication. Among the visual who participated in Espiral are: Tomás Rawski, Diego Alberti, and Ananke Assef.\n\ntaPeTe was created to fulfill the contemporary music’s need for a theater that can be configured to meet diverse purposes. The graduation of the acoustic ranks of absorption and diffusion in three defined spectral bands, helps the space to meet the requirement of traditional concert pieces. They require a high level of definition and sound customization.\nIn taPeTe can also be performed acoustic pieces for instruments which require very specific space conditions, but can also be adapted to performances which require the use of extended materials. Finally, on the auditorium can be developed instrumental and scenographic workshops, aimed to provide a space to fulfill luthiers’ and composers’ needs.\nIn every Project the artists are able to use the space and manage it in totally different ways, offering different experiencies from the traditional ones – not only in theatrical but also in spatial terms. In taPeTe can also be performed contemporary pieces that can not be displayed in any other conventional space.\n\nMinka is a pre-Columbian tradition of volunteer work, in which the members of a community work for the advantage of the whole group. In some áreas the Minka is still relevant today.\nBased on this concept, keeping in mind the idea the creation of a cooperative working method, the composers Luciano Azzigotti, Fernando Manassero and Rafael Subía Valdez designed a composing system under the name of Minka.\n\nThe first Minka was done in cooperation with the assembles Modelo62 (resident at Condit in April 2013) and the Contemporary Music Ensemble of the Department of Performing Arts IUNA,\nThe cooperative composition system consisted of a working day to create and assemble a piece from scratch, under five pre-set slogans organized in five phases.\n\nThe second Minka took place in October 2013 with suono mobile Argentina, a contemporary music ensemble from Cordoba (resident at conDiT) in cooperation with Contemporary Music Ensemble of the Department of Performing Arts IUNA.\n\nIn Argentina there is a tradition related to classical concert music, in which the programmers and regisseurs of Argentine concert halls receive (with the support of embassies) top level foreign artists who spread the music of their countries in Argentina.\nThis project has the clear objective to generate a mutual opportunity, so Argentine composers and musicians can spread their work abroad within an integrated broadcasting, recording, and international artists’ exchange program; framed by the principle of equal opportunities. The purpose is: update the old \"center-periphery\" relationship, energizing and encouraging the symmetry of cultural exchange between Argentina and the world.\nThe first chapter of Container is possible thanks to the collaboration between the Embassy of Argentina and conDiT.cheLA, whose team will be in charge of the organization, choice of repertoire and residents, commission works, and the activities advertising.\nThis project will be carried out by groups and halls in Vienna and Graz, associated with conDiT, and will be the second step after the partnerships we have begun in 2014 with the reception of Austrian artists in our platform.\nDuring 2015 conDiT will form an ensemble in Vienna with young professional musicians. The ensemble will premiere works by Argentine young composers, programmed for the second Container concert (the first antecedent is Transatlantic Interscores, July 2014) on December 10.\n\nDuring 2015 conDiT will be in charge of stages 2 and 3 of the restoration of the San Antonio de Padua church’s organ. This action crystallizes the commitment of the platform with the practice and exercise of the collective memory in Parque Patricios.\nThe restoration of an instrument transcends individual possibilities, it is always a call to the collective voice. Like bells announcing the moments of meeting, provide sound awareness to abandoned instruments allows us to hear and participate in rituals, and prefigure new ones, updating the exercise of our poetic consciousness that drives us to root ourselves and transcend.\nWith the different impacts of technological waves, the customs of the music’s functions have changed especially in the last century. We are surrounded by an invisible past that deserves to be reborn from silenced voices. This not only means restoring an instrument, but after that restore the memories of those organists who made music that triggers fervor, beliefs, and wills.\n\n\n\n\n\nconDIT.scime [expanded music concerts serie]\n\n\nNew Music for organ\n\n», in: .\n\n», in: .\n\n"}

It is similar to the British dreaded lurgi, and to terms used in the Nordic countries, in Italy, Australia and New Zealand. A child is said to \"catch\" cooties through close contact with an \"infected\" person or from an opposite-sex child of a similar age.\n\nThe word is thought to originate from the Austronesian language family, in which the Philippine languages, Maori and Malaysian-Indonesian word \"kutu\" refers to a parasitic biting insect. The earliest recorded uses of the term in English are by British soldiers during the First World War to refer to lice that proliferated in battlefield trenches.\n\nA hand-held game, the \"Cootie Game\", was made by the Irvin-Smith Company of Chicago in 1915; it involved tilting capsules (the cooties) into a trap over a background illustration depicting a battlefield. Other cootie games followed, all involving some form of bug or cootie, until The Game of Cootie was launched in 1948 by Schaper Toys. This game was very successful, becoming an icon; in 2003, the Toy Industry Association included it on its \"Century of Toys List\" of the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the 20th century.\n\nIn addition to the cooties games, the term \"cooties\" was popularised in America in the 1950s by military personnel coming back from service alongside the British in the South Pacific. Like the British dreaded lurgi, the cooties games developed during the early 1950s polio epidemic, and became associated with dirt and contagion.\n\nThe lice of the nicknamed \"cooties\" were also known as \"arithmetic bugs\" because \"they added to our troubles, subtracted from our pleasures, divided our attention, and multiplied like hell.\"\n\nIn Italy children have the term \"la peste\" (\"the plague\"). Cooties are known in Denmark as \"pigelus\" and \"drengelus\" and in Norway as \"jentelus\" and \"guttelus\": each pair meaning literally \"girl lice\" and \"boy lice\". In Sweden and Finland, it usually refers to girls, where they are known as \"tjejbaciller\" (literally \"girl bacilli\") and \"tyttöbakteeri\" (\"girl bacteria\"). In Serbia the game is known as \"šuga\"; the word means scabies.\n\nA child is said to \"catch\" cooties through any form of bodily contact, proximity, or touching of an \"infected\" person or from a person of the opposite sex of the same age. Often the \"infected\" person is someone who is perceived as different, due to disability, shyness, being of the opposite sex, or having peculiar mannerisms. The phrase is most commonly used by children in elementary school aged 4-10; however, it may be used by older children in a sarcastic or playful way. Sometimes the phrase specifies the type of cooties, as in \"\"you've got girl cooties!\" or \"you've got boy cooties!\"\" after a child has been touched by or in other ways interacted with a child of the opposite sex.\n\nIn the United States, children sometimes \"immunize\" one another from cooties by administering a \"cootie injection\". Typically, one child administers the \"shot\", using an index finger to trace circles and dots on another child's forearm while reciting the rhyme, \"Circle, circle, Dot, dot, – Now you've got the cootie shot!\" In some variations, a child then says, \"Circle, circle, Square, square, – Now you have it everywhere!\" In this case, the child receives an immunization throughout his or her body. These variations may continue to a final shot where the child says, \"Circle, circle, Knife, knife, – Now you've got it all your life!\". A number of other variations exist.\n"}

Croupiers are typically employed by casinos.\n\nOriginally a \"croupier\" meant one who stood behind a gambler, with extra reserves of cash to back him up during a gambling session. The word derived from \"croup\" (the rump of a horse) and was by way of analogy to one who rode behind on horseback. It later came to refer to one who was employed to collect the money from a gaming-table.\n\nOriginally a 'dealer' meant one who the person responsible for distributing cards or the player in the dealer position, regardless of whether or not that player is responsible for distributing the cards.\n\nTraining methods to become a casino croupier vary from country to country. In North America, blackjack is almost always the game that dealers learn first, as it is simple and popular, and when the dealer makes errors, they tend not to cost the casino much money. In Europe, croupiers tend to learn roulette first. Complex, busy games such as craps, with complicated payout systems, etc., are usually reserved for the most competent and/or ambitious dealers.\n\nAmerican, Australian and British croupiers are required to apply for a gambling license. This license includes police background checks and credit rating checks, to help determine if they are eligible to commence employment. Croupiers are not permitted to deal at a casino until being issued this license.\n\nAs is common with customer service staff in the United States, croupiers there depend on tips to make their wage worthwhile. While a croupier should theoretically have no personal interest in the outcome of the game, a successful player customarily tips the croupier, especially in American casinos. Tips are often pooled and divided amongst all the staff. Fraternising with customers is frowned upon, and most casinos prevent their gambling staff from being seen smoking or even being seen in uniform outside the casino. Some gambling strategies include suggestions to tip the casino dealer in order to create a good atmosphere and improve dealer's mood. According to these strategies, tipping might even make the dealer shuffle the cards less frequently and thereby allow easier tracking of particular cards. Australian casinos forbid dealers from taking tips.\n\nBecause casinos tend to allow smoking on the gambling floor, American croupiers are exposed to secondhand smoke. A health hazard evaluation of several Las Vegas casinos showed that nonsmoker croupiers suffered from more respiratory ailments than their administrative counterparts at the casinos and had cotinine and NNAL (both components of secondhand smoke) in their urine samples. Britain banned smoking in all public places, including casinos, in 2007.\n\n\n"}

The game is a prequel to the 1984 game \"Tir Na Nog\" as the story takes place before that game, when Cuchulainn was still alive.\n\nOne day Cuchulainn was travelling home from a battle with the Connachta with his companion Loeg the charioteer. On the way, they stopped off at an inn and Loeg was persuaded to help a beautiful young woman named Skar whose chariot was damaged. Cuchulainn took refreshment at the inn and on leaving realised Loeg was missing. He later discovered that Skar is a sorceress and ally of the Connachta and had taken Loeg to the timeless Secret City of Dun Darach in retribution for the death of Prince Amhair. Cuchulainn went on a long search for the mysterious city and eventually discovered it and entered Dun Darach to find Loeg.\n\n\"Dun Darach\" is an arcade adventure with interface and presentation nearly identical to \"Tir Na Nog\" or \"Marsport\" based on collecting objects, solving puzzles based on word puns or lateral thinking and interacting with other characters wandering through the city. The animation is in the same standard as \"Tir Na Nog\", although there is no parallax scrolling. Since the game can take many hours to complete, there is support for saving its state to cassette tape.\n\n\"Dun Darach\" improves over its predecessor in that other characters can give short hints to the player, rob him, and confiscate his belongings if he carries stolen goods. The player can also now buy, steal and sell goods from the many shops in the city, bet at a casino (Iomain Ludum) and even deposit money at a bank with daily compound interest. The city of Dun Darach is large and consists of different quarters with shops and the current time of the day is indicated by torches in the wall and by the greetings of characters. There is a \"blank\" area in the centre of the city in Iomain, the pleasure quarter; this was originally intended to be a brothel called \"Lady Q's\" and would have opened into a whole red-light district (this was censored and all that remains is a sign saying \"Forbidden\"). Cuchulainn can move north, south, east and west with the player \"rotating\" the view using the keyboard and then having Cuchulainn move left or right on the screen, so only one side of the street is visible at once.\n\nThe ZX Spectrum version was also voted number 57 in the \"Your Sinclair Official Top 100 Games of All Time\".\n\n"}

{"id": "564795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=564795", "title": "Epic theatre", "text": "Epic theatre\n\nEpic theatre () is a theatrical movement arising in the early to mid-20th century from the theories and practice of a number of theatre practitioners who responded to the political climate of the time through the creation of a new political theatre. Epic theatre is not meant to refer to the scale or the scope of the work, but rather to the form that it takes. Epic theatre emphasizes the audience's perspective and reaction to the piece through a variety of techniques that deliberately cause them to individually engage in a different way. The purpose of epic theatre is not to encourage an audience to suspend their disbelief, but rather to force them to think introspectively about the particular moments that are occurring on stage and why they are happening a certain way. \n\n\nThe term \"epic theatre\" comes from Erwin Piscator who coined it during his first year as director of Berlin's (1924–27). Piscator aimed to encourage playwrights to address issues related to \"contemporary existence.\" This new subject matter would then be staged by means of documentary effects, audience interaction, and strategies to cultivate an objective response. Epic theatre incorporates a mode of acting that utilises what Brecht calls \"gestus\". One of Brecht's most-important aesthetic innovations prioritised \"function\" over the sterile opposition between \"form\" and \"content\". Epic theatre and its many forms is a response to Richard Wagner's idea of \"Gesamtkunstwerk\", or \"total artwork\", which intends each piece of art is composed of each other art form. Since epic theatre is so focused on the specific relationship between form and content, these two ideas contradict each other, despite the fact that Brecht was heavily influenced by Wagner. Brecht discussed the priorities and approach of epic theatre in his work \"A Short Organum for the Theatre\". Although many of the concepts and practices involved in Brechtian epic theatre had been around for years, even centuries, Brecht unified them, developed the approach, and popularised it.\n\nNear the end of his career, Brecht preferred the term \"dialectical theatre\" to describe the kind of theatre he pioneered. From his later perspective, the term \"epic theatre\" had become too formal a concept to be of use anymore. According to Manfred Wekwerth, one of Brecht's directors at the Berliner Ensemble at the time, the term refers to the \"'dialecticising' of events\" that this approach to theatre-making produces.\n\nEpic theatre is distinct from other forms of theatre, particularly the early naturalistic approach and later \"psychological realism\" developed by Konstantin Stanislavski. Like Stanislavski, Brecht disliked the shallow spectacle, manipulative plots, and heightened emotion of melodrama; but where Stanislavski attempted to engender real human behaviour in acting through the techniques of Stanislavski's system and to absorb the audience completely in the fictional world of the play, Brecht saw this type of theatre as escapist. Brecht's own social and political focus was distinct, too, from surrealism and the Theatre of Cruelty, as developed in the writings and dramaturgy of Antonin Artaud, who sought to affect audiences viscerally, psychologically, physically, and irrationally. While both produced 'shock' in the audience, epic theatre practices would also include a subsequent moment of understanding and comprehension.\n\nWhile not invented by Brecht, the Verfremdungseffekt, known in English as the \"estrangement effect\" or the \"alienation effect\", was made popular by Brecht and is one of the most significant characteristics of Epic theatre. \n\nSome of the ways the Verfremdungseffekt can be achieved is by having actors play multiple characters, rearrange the set in full view of the audience, and \"break the fourth wall\" by speaking to the audience. The use of a narrator in The Caucasian Chalk Circle is another example of Verfremdungseffekt at work. Lighting can also be used to emulate the effect. For example, flooding the theatre with bright lights (not just the stage) and placing lighting equipment on stage can encourage the audience to fully acknowledge that the production is merely a production instead of reality.\n\nAs with the principle of dramatic construction involved in the epic form of spoken drama amalgamated or what Brecht calls \"non-Aristotelian drama\", the epic approach to play production utilizes a montage technique of fragmentation, contrast and contradiction, and interruptions. While the French playwright Jean Genet articulates a very different world view in his dramas from that found in Brecht's, in a letter to the director Roger Blin on the most appropriate approach to staging his \"The Screens\" in 1966, he advises an epic approach to its production:\n\nHistoricisation is also employed in order to draw connections from a historical event to a similar current event. This can be seen in the plays Mother Courage and Her Children and The Good Person of Szechwan, both written by Brecht, which comment on a current social or political issue using historical contexts. \n\nBrecht, too, advised treating each element of a play independently, like a music hall turn that is able to stand on its own.\nCommon production techniques in epic theatre include a simplified, non-realistic scenic design offset against a selective realism in costuming and props, as well as announcements or visual captions that interrupt and summarize the action. Brecht used comedy to distance his audiences from the depicted events and was heavily influenced by musicals and fairground performers, putting music and song in his plays.\n\nActing in epic theatre requires actors to play characters believably without convincing either the audience or themselves that they have \"become\" the characters. This is called Gestus, when an actor takes on the physical embodiment of a social commentary. Actors frequently address the audience directly out of character (\"breaking the fourth wall\") and play multiple roles. Brecht thought it was important that the choices the characters made were explicit, and tried to develop a style of acting wherein it was evident that the characters were choosing one action over another. For example, a character could say, \"I could have stayed at home, but instead I went to the shops.\" This he called \"fixing the Not / But element\".\n\n"}

The first part is the film \"\" (2013) and the last part Sunken Plum (to be released in 2017).\n\n\"Floating Melon\" is performed by non professional actors and it includes themes very delicate, often censured in China, specially the representation of the homosexuality in young people, a community that need to protect themselves due to the lack of protective laws in the country. The story is partially based in true events, but the atmosphere is close to the Film Noir genre, to reflect the only situation where queer people can express themselves, community that needs to live in the shadows of the night in the Chinese society.\nIt tells the story of \"Xiao Cheng\", a young Chinese guy that ask for help to a friend to resolve a big trouble, the guy with whom he spend the afternoon is dead on his bed from the effect of a drug, not something the Chinese authorities look kindly on.\n\nThe film premiered in Spain at the 53rd \"FICXIXON, Gijón International Film Festival\" in November 2015 and in China at the Art Gallery \"Shujingtang Alley Art Space\" in Chengdu (Sichuan) in June 2016.

It was produced by \"Almost Red Productions\" (company owned by the directors in China) in association with the Spanish company \"Arkadin Ediciones\".\n\nAccording to the directors, the main difficulty in the production was the casting. \"It was complicated to find a group of suitable actor that were interested in play gay characters and also were not scared of play some explicit scenes. Finally we collaborate with non professional actors. Also the production maintained a low profile to avoid the strong censhorship laws in China.\" \n\nThe directors comment about the film in these terms: \n\"Floating Melon is a fiction film, but inspired by characters that are present in the Chinese contemporary society. It reflects, with a film “noir genre” perspective in stylistic and narrative terms, the story of a young guy that cannot react in a situation that is beyond his imaginations. He needs to take a decision that will risk his future, consequence of the strict rules of the society, since he is surrounded by the confusion present on some of members of the young gay Chinese community, with no moral referents apart from the official doctrine.\n\n\"Floating Melon\" original soundtrack is composed by Andrea Centazzo. The collaboration between the directors and the composer started in 2008. \"Floating melon\" being the fifth collaboration, following , Mei Mei, Toto Forever and Desire Street. According to the directors, \"Fu Guo soundtrack is created from the point of view of the main character, Xiaoxi Cheng. The music guides the emotional journey of the character through the film, following the first moments of horror and confusion, until the last part, where bring us a more nostalgic atmosphere. Centazzo composed some experimental tracks for the beginning sequences, mixing sound effects, electronic music and real instruments.

{"id": "13022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13022", "title": "Garfield", "text": "Garfield\n\nGarfield is a comic created by Jim Davis. Published since 1978, it chronicles the life of the title character, Garfield, the cat; Jon Arbuckle, the human; and Odie, the dog. As of 2013, it was syndicated in roughly 2,580 newspapers and journals, and held the Guinness World Record for being the world's most widely syndicated comic strip.\n\nThough this is rarely mentioned in print, \"Garfield\" is set in Muncie, Indiana, the home of Jim Davis, according to the television special \"Happy Birthday, Garfield\". Common themes in the strip include Garfield's laziness, obsessive eating, coffee, and disdain of Mondays and diets. The strip's focus is mostly on the interactions among Garfield, Jon, and Odie, but other recurring minor characters appear as well. Originally created with the intentions to \"come up with a good, marketable character\", \"Garfield\" has spawned merchandise earning $750 million to $1 billion annually. In addition to the various merchandise and commercial tie-ins, the strip has spawned several animated television specials, two animated television series, two theatrical feature-length live-action/CGI animated films, and three fully CGI animated direct-to-video movies.\n\nPart of the strip's broad pop cultural appeal is due to its lack of social or political commentary; though this was Davis's original intention, he also admitted that his \"grasp of politics isn't strong,\" joking that, for many years, he thought \"OPEC was a denture adhesive\".\n\nIn the 1970s, Davis created a comic strip called \"Gnorm Gnat\", which met with little success. One editor said, \"his art was good, his gags were great,\" but that \"nobody can identify with bugs.\" Davis decided to take a long, hard look at the comics and he saw that dogs were doing very well, but there were no cats at the time. Davis figured that since he had grown up on a farm with 25 cats that he could come up with a strip based on a cat. He then proceeded to create a new strip with a cat as its main character and thus created Garfield, who borrows the first letter of his name from Davis's earlier work. \"Garfield\" originally consisted of four main characters. Garfield, the titular character, was based on the cats Davis was around growing up; he took his name and personality from Davis's grandfather, James A. Garfield Davis, who was, in Davis's words, \"a large, cantankerous man\". Jon Arbuckle came from a 1950s coffee commercial, and Odie was based on a car dealership commercial written by Davis, which featured Odie the Village Idiot. Early on in the strip, Odie's owner was a man named Lyman. He was written in to give Jon someone to talk with. Davis later realized that Garfield and Jon could \"communicate nonverbally\". The strip, originally centered on Jon, was first rejected by the King Features, Post-Hall and the Chicago Tribune-New York News agencies, all of which asked Davis to focus on the cat, who in their opinion, got the better lines. United Feature Syndicate accepted the retooled strip in 1978 and debuted it in 41 newspapers on June 19 of that year (however, after a test run, the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" dropped it, only to reinstate it after readers' complaints). \"Garfield\"'s first Sunday page ran on June 25, 1978, being featured as a third-pager until March 22, 1981. A half-page debuted the following Sunday, March 29, with the strips for March 14 and 21, 1982, having a unique nine-panel format, but UFS curtailed further use of it (it did, however, allow Davis to use the format for his \"U.S. Acres\" strip).\n\nThe strip underwent stylistic changes, evolving from the style of the 1978–83 strips, to a more cartoonish look from 1984 onward. This change has mainly affected Garfield's design, which underwent a \"Darwinian evolution\" in which he began walking on his hind legs, \"slimmed down\", and \"stopped looking ... through squinty little eyes\" His evolution, according to Davis, was to make it easier to \"push Odie off the table\" or \"reach for a piece of pie.\"\n\n\"Garfield\" quickly became a commercial success. In 1981, less than three years after its release, the strip appeared in 850 newspapers and accumulated over $15 million in merchandise. To manage the merchandise, Davis founded Paws, Inc. In 1982 the strip was appearing in more than 1,000 newspapers.\n\nBy 2002, \"Garfield\" became the world's most syndicated strip, appearing in 2,570 newspapers with 263 million readers worldwide; by 2004, \"Garfield\" appeared in nearly 2,600 newspapers and sold from $750 million to $1 billion worth of merchandise in 111 countries. In 1994, Davis's company, Paws, Inc., purchased all rights to the strips from 1978 to 1993 from United Feature. The strip is currently distributed by Universal Press Syndicate, while rights for the strip remain with Paws.\n\nWhile retaining creative control and being the only signer, Davis now only writes and usually does the rough sketches. Since the late 1990s most of the work has been done by long-time assistants Brett Koth and Gary Barker. Inking and coloring work is done by other artists, while Davis spends most of the time supervising production and merchandising the characters.\n\n\"Garfield\" was originally created by Davis with the intention to come up with a \"good, marketable character\". Now the world's most syndicated comic strip, \"Garfield\" has spawned a \"profusion\" of merchandise including clothing, toys, games, books, Caribbean cruises, credit cards, dolls, DVDs of the movies or the TV series, and related media.\n\nGarfield.com is the strip's official website, which contains archives of past strips along with games and an online store. Jim Davis has also collaborated with Ball State University and Pearson Digital Learning to create www.ProfessorGarfield.org, an educational website with interactive games focusing on math and reading skills, and with Children's Technology Group to create MindWalker, a web browser that allows parents to limit the websites their children can view to a pre-set list.\n\nA variety of edited \"Garfield\" strips have been made available on the Internet, some hosted on their own unofficial, dedicated sites. Dating from 2005, a site called the \"Garfield Randomizer\" created a three-panel strip using panels from previous \"Garfield\" strips. Another approach, known as \"Silent Garfield\", involves removing Garfield's thought balloons from the strips. Some examples date from 2006. A webcomic called \"Arbuckle\" does the above but also redraws the originals in a different art style. The \"Arbuckle\" website creator writes: \"'Garfield' changes from being a comic about a sassy, corpulent feline, and becomes a compelling picture of a lonely, pathetic, delusional man who talks to his pets. Consider that Jon, according to Garfield canon, cannot hear his cat's thoughts. This is the world as he sees it. This is his story\". Another variation along the same lines, called \"Realfield\" or \"Realistic Garfield\", is to redraw Garfield as a real cat as well as removing his thought balloons. Still another approach to editing the strips involves removing Garfield and other main characters from the originals completely, leaving Jon talking to himself. While strips in this vein can be found online as early as 2006, the 2008 site \"Garfield Minus Garfield\" by Dan Walsh received enough online attention to be covered by news media. Reception was largely positive: at its peak, the site received as many as 300,000 hits per day. Fans connected with Jon's \"loneliness and desperation\" and found his \"crazy antics\" humorous; Jim Davis himself called Walsh's strips an \"inspired thing to do\" and said that \"some of [the strips] work better [than the originals]\". Ballantine Books, which publishes the \"Garfield\" books, released a volume of \"Garfield Minus Garfield\" strips on October 28, 2008. The volume retains Davis as author and features a foreword by Walsh.\n\nGarfield's animation debut was on \"The Fantastic Funnies\", which aired on CBS in May 15, 1980, voiced by actor Scott Beach. \"Garfield\" was one of the strips featured, introduced as a newcomer (the strip was only two years old at the time). From 1982 to 1991, twelve primetime \"Garfield\" cartoon specials and one hour-long primetime documentary celebrating the character's 10th anniversary were aired; Lorenzo Music voiced Garfield in all of them. A Saturday morning cartoon show, \"Garfield and Friends\", aired for seven seasons from 1988 to 1994; this adaption also starred Music as the voice of Garfield. \"The Garfield Show\", a CGI series, started development in 2007 to coincide with the strip's 30th anniversary the following year. It premiered in France in December 2008 and made its U.S. debut on Cartoon Network on November 2, 2009.\n\n\"\" was released in theaters on June 11, 2004. Its sequel, \"\", was released on June 16, 2006. Three direct-to-video films were released, \"Garfield Gets Real\" on August 9, 2007, \"Garfield's Fun Fest\" on August 5, 2008, and \"Garfield's Pet Force\" on June 16, 2009. \nOn May 24, 2016, it was announced that Alcon Entertainment will develop a new CG animated Garfield movie with John Cohen and Steven P. Wegner ready to produce and to be directed by Mark Dindal.\n\nA \"Garfield\" video game was developed by Atari, Inc. for its Atari 2600 home video game system and appears in their 1984 catalog. However, after Atari's spinoff and sale of its home games and computers division, owner Jack Tramiel decided the character's royalties were too expensive given the declining state of the video game industry at the time, and the game was cancelled.\n\n\"\" is a 1987 video game for the Atari ST, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and the Amiga based on the comic strip. Towa Chiki made \"A Week of Garfield\" for the Family Computer, released only in Japan in 1989. Sega also made video games based on Garfield for the Genesis (\"\") and Windows 3.1 computers. Other companies made games, such as \"\" for the DS, published by Game Factory, \"Garfield's Nightmare\" for DS, \"Garfield's Funfest\" for DS, and \"Garfield Labyrinth\" for Game Boy. On PlayStation 2 were \"Garfield\" and \"Garfield 2\" (known in the US as \"Garfield, a Tale of Two Kitties\"). \"Garfield Lasagna World Tour\" was also made for PS2. And recent additions for mobile devices are \"Garfield's Diner\" and \"Garfield's Zombie Defense\".\n\nKonami also released a Garfield \"Handheld electronic game\" titled \"Lasagnator\" in 1991, which met with mild success.\n\nIn 2012, a series of Garfield video games was launched by French publisher Anuman Interactive, including \"My Puzzles with Garfield!\", \"Multiplication Tables with Garfield\", \"Garfield Kart\", and \"Garfield's Match Up\".\n\nJoseph Papp, producer of \"A Chorus Line\", discussed making a Garfield stage musical, but due to some complications, it never got off ground. A full-length stage musical, titled \"Garfield Live\", was planned to kick off its US tour in September 2010, but got moved to January 18, 2011, where it premiered in Muncie, Indiana. The book was written by Jim Davis, with music and lyrics by Michael Dansicker and Bill Meade, and it was booked by AWA Touring Services. The opening song, \"Cattitude\" can be heard on the national tour's website, along with two more, \"On the Fence,\" and \"Going Home!\". When the North-American tour concluded in 2012, it toured throughout Asia.\n\nIn agreement with Paws, Boom! Studios launched in May 2012 a monthly \"Garfield\" comic book, with the first issue featuring a story written by Mark Evanier (who has supervised \"Garfield and Friends\" and \"The Garfield Show\") and illustrated by Davis's long-time assistant Gary Barker.\n\nIn 2016, Hermes Press signed an agreement with Paws, Inc to publish an art book on the art of author Jim Davis, titled \"The Art of Jim Davis' Garfield\". The book includes an essay by author R.C. Harvey and other original material, and was released in July 2016 for the San Diego Comic-Con.\n\nThrough the Garfield strips, there have been many additional characters, but the main ones are described here.\n\nFirst appearance: June 19, 1978\n\nGarfield is an orange, fuzzy tabby cat born in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant (later revealed in the television special \"\" to be Mama Leoni's Italian Restaurant) who immediately ate all the pasta and lasagna in sight, thus developing his love and obsession for lasagna and pizza.\n\nGags in the strips commonly deal with Garfield's obesity (in one strip, Jon jokes, \"I wouldn't say Garfield is fat, but the last time he got on a Ferris wheel, the two guys on top starved to death\"), and his disdain of any form of exertion or work. He is known for saying \"breathing is exercise\".\n\nThough Garfield can be very cynical, he does have a soft side for his teddy bear, Pooky, food and sleep, and one Christmas he says, \"they say I have to get up early, be nice to people, skip breakfast ... I wish it would never end.\"\nHowever, in the feature film \"Garfield Gets Real\" and its sequels, Garfield is better behaved, friendlier towards Jon and Odie, less self-centered, and more sympathetic.\n\nIt has been wondered by many readers if Garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him. Sometimes, it seems like Jon can hear him. However, it is mentioned in more than one strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield. However, in the feature film Garfield Gets Real and its sequels, Garfield and the other animals save for Odie are able to talk to, and be understood by, Jon and the other humans. In the 1 April (April Fools' Day) 1997 strip, Garfield, still with thought balloons, can be understood by Jon.\n\nTo break the fourth wall, 19 June is celebrated within the strip as Garfield's birthday. The appearance in 1979 claimed it to be his first birthday, although in the first appearance of the strip (19 June 1978), he was portrayed as a fully-grown cat, implying that the birthday is of the strip itself.\n\nFirst appearance: June 19, 1978\n\nJon (Jonathan Q. Arbuckle) is Garfield's owner, usually depicted as an awkward clumsy geek who has trouble finding a date. Jon had a crush on Liz (Garfield's veterinarian) and is now dating her. Jon disapproves of Garfield's \"don't care, not interested,\" attitude, and often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him, sometimes stating an interesting fact, or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt Garfield into thought, Garfield tends to brush this off with a simple, yet logical remark, and despite the trouble Garfield causes, Jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of Garfield's shortcomings, a fact which Garfield often takes advantage of. In the December 23, 1980 strip, Jon states that he is thirty years old (nominally meaning he should presently be in his sixties, although he has not aged physically). His birthday is July 28.\n\nJon loves (or occasionally hates) Garfield and all cats. Many gags focus on this; his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills, his poor taste in clothes (Garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that \"two hundred moths committed suicide\"; in another, the \"geek police\" ordered Jon to \"throw out his tie\"), and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with \"polka ninjas\". Other strips portray him as lacking intelligence (he is seen reading a pop-up book in one strip).\n\nJon was born on a farm that apparently contained few amenities; in one strip, his father, upon seeing indoor plumbing, remarks, \"Woo-ha! Ain't science something?\" Jon occasionally visits his parents, brother and grandmother at their farm. It was implied that Jon is inspired by a drawing of Davis himself when he was first drawing the strip. Jon was initially portrayed as a cartoonist in earlier strips, as Jim Davis stated this would've been a way to express his own frustrations as a cartoonist himself, but this eventually faded in the later strips.\n\nFirst appearance: August 8, 1978\n\nOdie is a yellow, long-eared beagle with a large, slobbering tongue, who walks on all four legs, though occasionally he will walk on two like Garfield. He was originally owned by Jon's friend Lyman, though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book \"Garfield: His 9 Lives\" (1984) retcons Odie's origin: there is no mention of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was a kitten). Odie is younger than Garfield and usually portrayed as naïve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield's cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more intelligently, as one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield's foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon are out of the house, Odie is seen reading \"War and Peace\" and watching a television program, \"An Evening With Mozart\". Odie has only talked once. In another strip, published on January 28, 2010, he is seen solving Jon's sudoku puzzle.\n\nFirst appearance: June 26, 1979\nDr. Liz Wilson is Garfield's veterinarian and a long-time crush of Jon Arbuckle. She has a somewhat deadpan, sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to Jon's outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion. Jon often attempted to ask her out on a date, but rarely succeeded; however, in an extended story arc from June 19 to July 29, 2006 (the main event on July 28), Liz and Jon kiss. Now, they are a couple.\n\nMany of the gags focus on Garfield's obsessive eating and obesity; his dislike of spiders; his hatred of Mondays, diets, and any form of exertion; his constant shedding (which annoys Jon); and his abuse of Odie and Jon as well as his obsession with mailing Nermal to Abu Dhabi, or simply throwing \"through\" the front door. Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of raisins and spinach), Garfield is particularly fond of lasagna; he also enjoys eating Jon's houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish). He also has odd relationships with household pests; Garfield generally spares mice, and even cooperates with them to cause mischief (much to Jon's chagrin), but will readily swat or pound spiders flat. Other gags focus on Jon's poor social skills and inability to get a date; before he started dating Liz, he often tried to get dates, usually without success (in one strip, after failing to get a date with \"Nancy\", he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother; he ended up getting \"shot down by three generations\"). When he does get a date, it usually goes awry; Jon's dates have slashed his tires, been tranquilized, and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears. The storylines featuring Jon's dates rarely appear now. Before, he had dates with many odd characters, whereas now, he exclusively dates Liz.\n\nGarfield's world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, a place he loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food is the center of most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his tractor (which he double-parked) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon takes Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to. Frequently, the characters break the fourth wall, mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out), or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting, \"I can hardy eben understad by own thoughts.\"\n\nOne particular semi-recurring storyline features Jon and Liz on a date in a restaurant. They sometimes are waited on by the Italian Armando, who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards Jon, presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery. On other occasions, the couple receives a different waiter, such as a large ogre-like man who intimidates Jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food.\n\nAnother commonly recurring character, although hardly ever seen, is Jon's neighbor, Mrs. Feeny. Garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her, to the point the she even erects an electric fence (which of course, does not stop him).\n\nOther unique themes are things like \"Garfield's Believe it or Don't\", \"Garfield's Law\", \"Garfield's History of Dogs\", and \"Garfield's History of Cats\", which show science, history, and the world from Garfield's point of view. Another particular theme is \"National Fat Week\", where Garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people. Also, there was a storyline involving Garfield catching Odie eating his food and \"kicking Odie into next week\". Soon, Garfield realizes that \"Lunch isn't the same without Odie. He always slips up behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my food\" (Garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself). A few days after the storyline began, Garfield is lying in his bed with a \"nagging feeling I'm forgetting something,\" with Odie landing on Garfield in the next panel. Jon and Liz began to go out more frequently, Jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after Garfield and Odie, though they do not always work out. Two particular examples are Lillian, an eccentric (and very nearsighted) old lady with odd quirks, and Greta, a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during New Year's Eve. Most of December is spent preparing for Christmas, with a predictable focus on presents. Other Christmas themed strips include Jon's attempts at decorating the tree and house, or the attempt to buy the tree. Some years, the Christmas strips started as early as the end of November. Another example is \"Splut Week\", when Garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him. For most of Garfield's history, being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia \"splut\", hence the name.\n\nEvery week before June 19, the strip focuses on Garfield's birthday, which he dreads because of his fear of getting older. This started happening after his sixth birthday. However, before his 29th birthday, Liz put Garfield on a diet. On June 19, 2007, Garfield was given the greatest birthday present: \"I'M OFF MY DIET!\" Occasionally the strip celebrates Halloween as well with scary-themed jokes, such as mask gags. There are also seasonal jokes, with snow-related gags common in January or February and beach- or heat-themed jokes in the summer.\n\nOne storyline, which ran the week before Halloween in 1989 (Oct 23 to Oct 28), is unique among Garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous. It depicts Garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists. In Garfield's \"Twentieth Anniversary Collection\", in which the strips are reprinted, Jim Davis discusses the genesis for this series:\n\nOne of the recurring storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest one of these lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off – and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost). Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, monkeys, a seal, a snake, a kangaroo and joey, and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.\n\nAnother story involved Jon going away on a business trip around Christmas time, leaving Garfield a week's worth of food, which he devoured instantly. Garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out. He then reunites with his mother, and eventually makes it back home in the snow on Christmas Eve (1984 December 3 to 23). Part of this storyline was taken from the 1983 Emmy-winning special \"Garfield on the Town\".\n\nPaws, Inc. was founded in 1981 by Jim Davis to support the Garfield comic strip and its licensing. It is located in Muncie, Indiana, and has a staff of nearly 50 artists and licensing administrators. In 1994, the company purchased all rights to the Garfield comic strips from 1978 to 1993 from United Feature Syndicate. However, the original black and white daily strips and original color Sunday strips remain copyrighted to United Feature Syndicate. The full color daily strips and recolored Sunday strips are copyrighted to Paws as they are considered a different product. Though rights to the strip remain with Paws, Inc., it is currently distributed by Universal Press Syndicate.\n\nDavis attracted criticism from the mainstream media for a \"Garfield\" strip in which the last panel appeared to be a negative reference to Veterans Day that appeared in newspapers on November 11, 2010. In the strip, a spider who is about to be squashed by Garfield boasts that if he is squished, he will get a holiday in his remembrance. The next panel shows a classroom of spiders in which a teacher asks the students why spiders celebrate \"National Stupid Day,\" implying that the spider was squished. Davis quickly apologized for the poorly timed comic strip, saying that it had been written a year in advance and that both his brother and son were veterans.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45001728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45001728", "title": "Gravon: Real Virtuality", "text": "Gravon: Real Virtuality\n\nGravon: Real Virtuality is a 1995 video game developed by Suma. The game originally was released for Atari Falcon and later ported to Microsoft Windows in 2013 and packed as a bonus game to \"Take On Mars\". The famous game \"\" is considered to be a spiritual successor to \"Gravon\".\n\nThe player pilots a hovercraft and has to complete tasks in the missions. Possible tasks include finding something, destroying an enemy object, destroying enemy fighters, etc. Missions are set on a large terrain that is procedurally generated. The player can come across mountains, villages, forests, and other terrain features. The game environment also differs on different missions. The player has to fight enemies that try to prevent him from completing the task. Types of enemies include hovercrafts, tanks, helicopters and defense towers.\n\nThe game's setting is a planetoid belt. The belt is occupied by enemy NPC's. The player character is a hovercraft pilot who has just completed training and is sent to the belt to fight enemies and fulfill multiple missions. The player character gets promoted after every mission success.\n\nWhen the last mission is finished the outro is seen. The player character and protagonist returns home in a pod with a parachute. The player character lands in an ocean where a helicopter arrives to exfiltrate the character.\n\n\"Gravon\" was created by brothers Marek and Ondřej Španěl. They founded their development studio Suma in 1985. They finished their second game \"Invaze z Aldebaranu\" in 1992 and started to be curious about the military genre. They decided to create a military simulator with a large assortment of vehicles. The result of this interest in military simulation was the game \"Gravon\". They decided to make it for the Atari Falcon due to the fact that they didn't trust Windows yet. They released \"Gravon\" in 1995. \"Gravon\" was well received but was a financial failure, not selling many copies. Only 400 copies of \"Gravon\" were sold.\n\nSuma then worked on multiple unfinished Projects like Rio Grande and Poseidon. Poseidon was meant to be a sequel to Gravon but only a technical demo was released. The Španěl brothers then changed the name of their studio from Suma to Bohemia Interactive and developed \"\". \"Operation: Flashpoint\" was a spiritual successor to \"Gravon\".

{"id": "2215034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215034", "title": "Ike's Wee Wee", "text": "Ike's Wee Wee\n\n\"Ike's Wee Wee\" is the fourth episode of the second season of the American animated television series \"South Park\". The 18th episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on May 27, 1998. In the episode, school counselor Mr. Mackey is fired, and turns to drugs. Meanwhile, the boys misconstrue what circumcision entails, and try to save Kyle's younger brother Ike from his upcoming bris.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. \"Ike's Wee Wee\" satirizes certain attitudes towards drug users, and explores whether family can only mean those who are related by blood. This episode introduced Ike's backstory as an adopted Canadian child. \"Ike's Wee Wee\" received positive responses from critics, who especially praised the episode for its touching moments.\n\nMr. Mackey, the school counselor, is giving a drug and alcohol prevention lecture to the class, emphasizing that smoking, drinking, marijuana, and LSD are bad. He passes a sample of marijuana around the class so that the children can learn its smell, but it is never returned. As a result, Mackey is fired, and is later kicked out of his house, leaving him homeless. A desperate Mackey gives in to trying marijuana one night in an alley, and later, LSD. Soon enough, Mr. Mackey becomes a drug-addled hippie, and meets a female hippie, with whom he decides to get married. While on honeymoon in India, Mr. Mackey is captured and taken into rehab. Mr. Mackey emerges clean from rehab and is given his job back.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyle invites Stan, Cartman, and Kenny to his younger brother Ike's bris. When they learn more about what a bris is, and misconstrue it as a party where they are going to remove his penis, Kyle tries to find a way to hide his brother from his parents and the circumcision process. Kyle puts Ike on a train to Nebraska and makes an Ike-style doll out of meat bones in an attempt to not arouse his parents' suspicions. This backfires when the doll is eaten by a dog, which leads to them to think that Ike is dead. It is at the funeral that Kyle finds out that Ike is not his biological brother, but was adopted from Canada due to the tombstone featuring the Canadian flag. Upon discovering this, Kyle decides that Ike is no longer his brother. His parents are shocked after Kyle reveals the truth, and Ike is retrieved from Nebraska.\n\nThe day of the bris arrives, and Kyle is grounded for sending Ike away. When the mohel arrives to perform the bris, Ike flees to Kyle's room in terror. Seeing Ike in distress and some old pictures prompts a change of heart in Kyle, and he defends his brother fiercely before it is explained to him what a circumcision actually is, at which point Stan and Cartman decide they want to be circumcised too. They watch the process; even though the boys pass out momentarily, Kyle is relieved to see Ike unharmed.\n\n\"Ike's Wee Wee\" was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. The scene where Mr. Mackey loses the marijuana cigarette in class was inspired by a real event from Parker's life, where a counselor came into his class in seventh grade, and passed around a lit piece of marijuana, which then disappeared. At the beginning and end of the episode, there are scenes where the kids imitate Mr. Mackey's voice to him, while he is oblivious to the fact that he is being made fun of. Parker and his classmates used to do the same thing to their counselor in junior high school, who was the basis for Mr. Mackey's character. Parker said that he was especially proud of Chef's line, \"There's a time and a place for everything, and it's called college\", which is something Parker believes in, noting that if he had a child, he would tell him: \"Do whatever you want, just wait till college because you don't know what the fuck's up right now.\" Chef's sentence would later return in the season four episode \"The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000\".\n\nThe episode introduced Ike's backstory as a Canadian child adopted by the Broflovskis. Ever since the recurring characters Terrance and Phillip were established to be Canadians in the season one finale \"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut\", and the subsequent season two premiere \"Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus\", all Canadian characters on \"South Park\" have shared the same simplistic design: having simple beady eyes and a floppy head made up of two halves. While Ike had been on the show since its first episode, the writers originally did not know that he was going to be Canadian; he was retroactively made one based on his visual similarity to Terrance and Phillip. Ike's backstory would play an important role in the film \"\", which involves a fictional American–Canadian war, as well as in future episodes of the series, such as the season seven episode, \"It's Christmas in Canada\", in which Ike's biological parents take him away from the Broflovskis and bring him back to Canada.\n\n\"Ike's Wee Wee\" features regular voice acting from series creators Parker and Matt Stone for most characters, Mary Kay Bergman (credited as Shannen Cassidy) for female characters, and Isaac Hayes for Chef. Additional dialogue was provided by \"South Park\" audio engineer Bruce Howell, while Ike's lines were uttered by Howell's then-5-year-old son Jesse.\n\n\"Ike's Wee Wee\" raises the question of who really can be considered one's family. At first, Kyle's implicit idea is that family consists of \"those for whom we care that are related by blood\". Based on this viewing of family, he no longer feels the need to help Ike when he learns that they are not related by blood. As the story progresses, Kyle questions his initial beliefs, and forms the episode's central moral by saying that \"Family isn't about whose blood you have. It's about who you care about.\" Thus, Kyle's reformed view of family not only includes his adopted brother, but his friends as well. Kyle's questioning of his own morals has been likened to engaging in the dialectical Socratic method of inquiry.\n\nThe subplot of \"Ike's Wee Wee\" satirizes certain drug subcultures, as well as drug use, and societal attitudes towards drug users. The way the episode portrays Mr. Mackey's lack of real knowledge about drug use and addiction has been described as an example of \"South Park\" satirizing left-wing politics, when \"they lead to the sort of hypocrisy inconsistent with a proper open society\".\n\nPart of the episode revolves around the practice of religious male circumcision in Judaism, and the related ceremony called the \"brit milah\" or bris, and the boys' misunderstanding of the tradition. The boys believe that circumcision entails the cutting off of one's penis, which they refer to by the childish colloquial term \"wee wee\", except for Cartman, who insists on calling it \"fireman\". Cannabis is also referred to by various names, including \"weed\", \"grass\", \"pot\", and \"marijuana\", in which Mr. Mackey constantly pronounces the letter \"j\" as (as in \"jam\"), which makes Kyle mispronounce the drug as \"marry-Jew wanna\".\n\nDrug use is often portrayed in conjunction with the hippie subculture, through hippie characters, such as the two teenagers that give LSD to Mackey, and the woman that he befriends and eventually marries. Jimbo and Cartman both use the term \"hippie\" pejoratively. During their argument, Jimbo tells Mackey that he should just go to a Grateful Dead concert, to which Mackey says he can't since Jerry Garcia is deceased. On two occasions, the episode shows people watching \"Teletubbies\" while high on marijuana or in rehab. In his drug prevention speech, Mackey claims that LSD was made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, former members of The Beatles. Both Lennon and McCartney are known to have experimented with the drug.\n\nWhile walking home, Mr. Mackey drunkenly sings the 1983 Pat Benatar song \"Love Is a Battlefield\". During Ike's supposed funeral, a bagpipe player starts playing the Hebrew folk song \"Hava Nagila\". At the funerals, the priest uses the phrase \"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust\", from the Anglican burial service. When the townspeople start to harass Mackey, one of them shouts, \"Now we see what you and Homer Simpson have in common... Dope!\". This references the famous catchphrase from \"The Simpsons\", \"D'oh!\", which sounds similar to the word \"dope\", meaning illicit drugs. At Kyle's house, Kyle's parents offer the boys a dish called \"GaHekgafuga\", which is not a real dish. When Mackey is in India, he is captured by members of The A-Team, and driven away in their van. Mackey is taken to rehabilitation to the Betty Ford Clinic, which is based on a real-life hospital.\n\nA common plot device is referenced, where a shoulder angel (represents conscience) and a shoulder devil (representing temptation) appear near a character. This concept is spoofed in the episode, as both the devil and the angel suggest to Mackey that he should drink the beer. When Stan tells Kyle what he thinks a bris means, a dolly zoom is used, which is an unsettling filmmaking effect often used to show that a character is undergoing a major realization. The hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs are portrayed by different means. When inhaling cannabis, the alley that Mr. Mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful. After taking LSD, Mackey's head inflates like a giant balloon, and then literally detaches from his body, and floats away (the boys interact with Mackey by looking up at his head as it floats over them).\n\nIn the scene where the boys are talking to Chef, he leaves without answering the boys' sexual question, angrily saying, \"Dammit, children, why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you. Ask your parents for once!\". This is in reference to Chef's tendency to give advice to the boys. While the children are trying to think of what is the most important thing for a man, Cartman says \"Ham?\", to which Stan angrily replies, \"No, not ham, you fat fuck!\". This exchange was used verbatim between the same characters in \"The Spirit of Christmas\", the 1995 short film that was the precursor to \"South Park\".\n\nTwo episodes preceded \"Ike's Wee Wee\" in the second season of the show. The episode scheduled for April 1, 1998 promised to resolve the cliffhanger ending of the first season finale, \"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut\", regarding the identity of Cartman's father, but was in fact an April Fools' Day joke: \"Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus\", an entire episode revolving around the two title characters. The April 1 episode was supposed to be a one-off, with the rest of the season starting in May. However, following overwhelmingly negative fan reaction, the episode resolving the Cartman's father storyline, \"Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut\", was moved from its planned May 20 air date to April 22. \"Ike's Wee Wee\" then started a six-episode run of the season when it was broadcast on Comedy Central in the United States on May 20, 1998.\n\"Ike's Wee Wee\" was met with favorable reviews. Critics especially praised the episode for its touching moments, in contrast with the off-color humor often employed in the series. In his review of the episode in the \"Chicago Tribune\", Allan Johnson praised the episode, especially in comparison with the first two episodes of the season, considering it to be one of the better episodes of the series. When the series reached its 100th episode in 2003, the same writer also listed \"Ike's Wee Wee\" as one of the \"top 10 episodes that have made one of the most provocative comedies on TV\". A review in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that \"n the midst of all this potty-mouthed humor, there are moments that are downright touching\", and particularly highlighted the ending of \"Ike's Wee Wee\" as an example, explaining that \"all's well in the end, and Kyle and the boys learn a lesson about family values that even Dan Quayle would approve of\". In 2000, visitors of the Comedy Central website chose \"Ike's Wee Wee\" as their favorite episode during a voting called \"\"South Park\" e-Lections\", held around the time of the United States presidential election that year.\n\nMr. Mackey's line, \"drugs are bad, m'kay?\", has entered popular culture. The Eminem song, \"The Kids\" (which is featured on the B-side of the single \"The Way I Am\" and the clean version of \"The Marshall Mathers LP\"), is thematically about drug use, and makes numerous references to \"South Park\" and impressions of the show's characters, including an impression of Mr. Mackey's voice and the repetition of his line. The song \"Hip Hop Quotables\" by Ludacris, from his album \"Chicken-n-Beer\", also contains the line. In 2008, the line was referenced in the dissenting opinion of a judge, in a case of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Also, in a 2010 marijuana-related court case at the Maryland Court of Appeals, Judge Clayton Greene, Jr. referenced the episode in his dissenting opinion, calling Mr. Mackey's words \"immortal\". In 2011, during a judiciary committee hearing about a marijuana-related bill in Denver, Colorado, a representative showed off a potential packaging for edible marijuana products. According to a group called the Cannabis Therapy Institute, the label on the package, which bore the placeholder text, \"Legal and governmentally approved statement describing that pot is bad, M-ok\", was a reference to the \"South Park\" episode.\n\n\"Ike's Wee Wee\" was released on VHS in April 1999, along with the episode \"Chickenlover\", on a video titled \"South Park: Volume 8\". The episode saw its first DVD release in December 1999, on a disc called \"South Park: Volume 4\", which also included \"Chickenlover\", as well as \"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut\" and \"Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut\". \"South Park: The Complete Second Season\" was released on DVD on June 3, 2003. On these home releases, \"Ike's Wee Wee\" has a humorous introduction by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who are playing music to the elderly in a retirement home. Episodes of season two have also been released digitally, on services such as Amazon Video, the iTunes Store, and Xbox Live Marketplace. Like most episodes of \"South Park\", \"Ike's Wee Wee\" is available to watch for free on the show's website, SouthParkStudios.com.\n\n"}

The word \"speelklok\" means musical clock.\n\nOver the years the museum has become popular nationwide and also internationally. The museum's restoration workshops are a leader in their field, and are known for their excellent standards.\n\nThe museum had its origins in an exhibition of mechanical organs and other musical automata in Utrecht in the summer of 1956. The great success of this led to the creation of a permanent national museum dedicated to mechanical musical instruments. In 1984 the museum's present housing in the central medieval Buurkerk (citizens' church) was officially opened by Queen Beatrix.\n\nFor its 50-year Jubilee in 2006 the museum held a special exhibition, \"Royal Music Machines\".

{"id": "57790564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57790564", "title": "Patintero", "text": "Patintero\n\nPatintero, also known as harangang-taga or tubigan, is a traditional Filipino children's game. Along with \"tumbang preso\", it is one of the most popular outdoor games played by children in the Philippines.\n\n\"Patintero\" is derived from Spanish word \"tinte\" (\"tint\" or \"ink\") in reference to the drawn lines. Another name for it is \"tubigan\", \"tubiganay\", or \"tubig-tubig\" (\"water [game]\"), due to the fact that the grid lines are also commonly drawn by wetting the ground with water. It is also known as \"harangang-taga\" or \"harang-taga\" (lit. \"block and catch\"), referring to the game mechanics.\n\nOther names for the game include \"lumplumpas\" (Igorot), \"sabatan\" (Kapampangan), \"sinibon\" (Ilokano), and \"tadlas\" (for four players) or \"birus-birus\" (for six players) in eastern Visayas.\n\nPatintero is played on a rectangular grid drawn into the ground. The rectangle is usually in length, and wide. It is subdivided into four to six equal parts by drawing a central lengthwise line and then one or two crosswise lines. The size of the rectangle and the number of subdivisions can be adjusted based on the number of players. The individual squares in the grid must be large enough that someone can stay in the middle out of reach of someone standing on the lines.\n\nTwo teams are needed, each with around two to six players. One team acts as the taggers, the other acts as the runners. This is usually decided by a game of rock–paper–scissors (\"jak-en-poy\") or a coin toss.\n\nThe object of the game is to cross the rectangle back and forth without getting tagged. One tagger is usually assigned per crosswise line. Taggers can only move along their respective lines, with the exception of the tagger on the first line who is regarded as the team leader (\"patoto\"). Unlike the other taggers, the \"patoto\" can also move along the central lengthwise line. Taggers can tag runners at any time, including those already past them, but \"both\" of their feet must always be on the lines. Tagging a runner when none or only one foot is contacting the line is not counted. \n\nRunners can cross at any time and to any adjacent square, however, they can only exit the playing rectangle at both ends of the rectangle. Once a runner is tagged, they are out and will sit out the match until the next game. Teams score points when they complete \"isang gabi\" (\"one night\"), a full circuit of the playing rectangle, from one end to the other and back again. Once all the runners have been tagged, the teams reverse roles, with the taggers now becoming the runners and vice versa.\n\nIn some versions of the game, the match ends if even only one runner is tagged. In others, this only applies if the \"patoto\" of the team is tagged. In modern versions, there is also sometimes a time limit for how long runners can attempt to score points. The match ends once the time is up, regardless if no points have been scored.\n\nJaywalking is derisively referred to as \"playing \"patintero\" with cars\" in the Philippines.\n\n"}

{"id": "949769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=949769", "title": "Repechage", "text": "Repechage\n\nRepechage (; , \"fishing out, rescuing\") is a practice in series competitions that allows participants who failed to meet qualifying standards by a small margin to continue to the next round, in a similar way as a wild card system works out.\n\nDifferent types of repechage can occur. As a basis for the examples below, assume that 64 competitors are divided into four pools of 16 competitors, labeled A, B, C, and D. The first three rounds of the primary championship bracket winnow the field down to eight competitors for the quarter-final.\n\nIn full repechage, a competitor who loses to the pool winner drops into the repechage bracket. The theory is that a worthy competitor who is paired with another worthy competitor should not be unduly penalized by luck of the draw, but have an opportunity to fight for at least third place. In our example, four competitors from each pool (the loser to the pool winner in the first, second, third and quarter-final rounds) drop into the repechage bracket. A larger pool results in a longer wait for first-round losers to determine if they will compete in repechage.\n\nQuarter-final repechage pulls losers from the quarter-final round only. The prior rounds are single-elimination. Losers in the quarter-final from two pools (e.g., A and B) are entered into one bracket of the repechage first round. Quarter-final losers from the other two pools are entered into the other bracket. Repechage losers are placed in seventh place. Winners of these matches play against semifinal losers of opposite bracket. Losers are placed in fifth place and winners are awarded with bronze medal each.\n\nIn double-elimination repechage, any loser in the championship bracket drops into the repechage bracket. Typically the losers from the championship bracket's first round compete against each other in the repechage first round for the right to compete in the repechage second round (against the championship bracket second round losers). In \"full\" double-elimination repechage, the eventual repechage bracket winner competes against the championship bracket winner to determine the winner of the overall competition, but the repechage bracket winner must win two matches to win the competition whereas the championship bracket winner needs only win one match. In a \"partial\" double-elimination repechage bracket, the bracket winner(or winners in dual third-place scenario) will take third place.\n\nDual third-place finishers can result with full, quarter-final, or double-elimination repechage. Losers from two championship bracket pools (e.g., A and B) are placed into one repechage bracket and losers from the other two pools are placed in the other repechage bracket. The winner from each pool's repechage bracket competes against the loser in the championship semi-final who comes from one of that repechage bracket's two pools. Or, in a \"cross-over\" arrangement, the semi-final loser comes from the other bracket's pools. Each winner of this repechage round takes third place. The losers of the prior two repechage rounds are often considered to take fifth and seventh places.\n\nA consolation bracket is when losers drop from the primary championship bracket and compete for third place or a lesser consolation prize. Hence, except in the case of full double-elimination repechage, a repechage bracket might be referred to as a consolation bracket.\n\nIn Major League Baseball a repechage bracket is formed by wild card teams in each League. Entry to the Postseason is determined by the Wild Card Game.\n\nAt many levels of amateur play in baseball and softball, including the National Collegiate Athletic Association, tournaments are established as a full double-elimination repechage.\n\nIn the current 64-team baseball and softball NCAA tournament formats, there are alternating four-team double-elimination repechage formats, and best two-of-three games series. The first and third rounds are full double-elimination repechages, while the second and fourth rounds are best two-of-three game series.\n\nThe Southeastern Conference baseball tournament has a flip-bracket format; the winner of the first championship bracket plays the winner of the second repechage bracket, and the winner of the second championship bracket plays the winner of the first repechage bracket. As usual, the repechage bracket winner must win two matches to advance to the championship game.\n\nSome competitions use a modified double elimination format called Olympic Crossing, in which the winning teams compete until two teams remain, while teams with one loss continue in an elimination format until two of them remain. Then, in the semifinals, each of the two remaining winning teams play a team from the losers bracket, and the winners of these matches compete in the final match, while the semifinal losers compete for third place.\n\nIn cycling, repechage heats are used in the Keirin and match sprints. These heats give a second chance for non-qualifiers in the preliminary heat(s) to advance to the next round of competition.\n\nAlthough not normally used for FIE events, sometime local events use direct elimination with repechage. A disadvantage is that some competitors have to wait. An advantage for team events is more willingness to use DE from the start (with seeding by drawing lots) instead of pools. Example format sheets are here.\n\nRepechage was formerly widely used in fencing tournaments, but the majority have now abandoned it, an exception being United States Fencing Association Division I tournaments.\n\nIn karate, judo, taekwondo, and wrestling tournaments, single-elimination brackets are used to determine the two athletes who will compete in the final for first and second place. The repechage bracket is built from athletes who were knocked out by the finalists and building brackets to determine third place.\n\nRepechage addresses the possibility of two top competitors meeting in an early round, allowing the loser a chance to compete for a bronze medal.\n\nIn \"University Challenge\", 28 teams compete in each season. Of the fourteen teams who lose in the first round, the four teams with the highest scores compete in the Highest Scoring Losers Play-Offs, with the two winners advancing to the second round.\n\nIn rowing, often only the first one or two boats in a race will qualify automatically for the next round, and the other boats race again in one or more repechage to qualify. Conditions such as wind vary between the heats, often significantly affecting a competitor's time, and the repechage system allows the \"fastest losers\" to qualify irrespective of the variable conditions in the opening heats.\n\nIn rugby, the qualification processes for the Rugby Union World Cup and the Rugby League World Cup use a repechage system. The Air New Zealand Cup, New Zealand's domestic professional competition in Union, used the repechage in the 2006 Air New Zealand Cup, but scrapped it for the 2007 Air New Zealand Cup.\n\nA repechage stage in sailing is sometimes used in match-racing competition to allow teams finishing the round robin(s) just below the top-level teams a chance to advance to the quarter-final stage. This is standard competition for the Olympic-class events, such as the ISAF Sailing World Cup.\n\nIn field athletics, automatic qualification for the next round depends on meeting or surpassing a specified minimum result. The remaining qualification spots (if any) are given in order to the best results.\n\nIn track athletics, automatic qualification for the next round is given to the best competitors in each heat. Other competitors with the best times may qualify for the next round indirectly as \"fastest losers\" as a result of the repechage. If a particular heat was significantly faster than the others, repechage spots can be all taken by athletes from that heat.\n\nAlternatives to repechage include single elimination, round robin, wild card and the Swiss system.\n"}

{"id": "625090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=625090", "title": "Shirley Valentine", "text": "Shirley Valentine\n\nShirley Valentine is a one-character play by Willy Russell. Taking the form of a monologue by a middle-aged, working class Liverpool housewife, it focuses on her life before and after a transforming holiday abroad.\n\nWondering what has happened to her youth and feeling stagnant and in a rut, Shirley finds herself regularly alone and talking to the wall while preparing an evening meal of egg and chips for her emotionally distant husband. When her best friend offers to pay for a trip-for-two to Greece, she packs her bags, leaves a note on the cupboard door in the kitchen, and heads for a fortnight of rest and relaxation. In Greece, with just a little effort on her part, she rediscovers everything she had been missing about her existence in England. She finds so much happiness, in fact, that when the vacation is over she decides not to return, ditching her friend at the airport and going back to the hotel where she'd been staying to ask for a job and to live a newly self-confident life in which she is at last true to herself.\n\nCommissioned by the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool, the play premiered in 1986, with Noreen Kershaw directed by Glen Walford. Two years later it opened in London's West End at the Vaudeville Theatre, with Pauline Collins directed by Simon Callow. After eight previews, the Broadway production, with Collins again directed by Callow, opened on 16 February 1989 at the Booth Theatre, where it ran for 324 performances. Ellen Burstyn replaced Collins later in the run, and Loretta Swit starred in a US national tour in 1995.\n\nFrom 26 March - 8 May 2010, as part of the Willy Russell season at the Menier Chocolate Factory, Meera Syal played Shirley in the production's first London West End revival. A West End transfer of the Menier Chocolate Factory production ran at the Trafalgar Studios from 20 July - 30 October 2010. Meera Syal reprised her role as Shirley; this production was adapted and broadcast by BBC Radio Four in 2010 and 2017.\n\nA 30th Anniversary Tour, starring Jodie Prenger ran in the UK from March 2017 to November 2017.

The movie is set in Africa rather than the book's setting of South America, and the character of Lord John Roxton has been replaced with a female character played by Tamara Gorski.\n\nIt was followed by a sequel the same year, Return to the Lost World, with the same director and main cast.\n\nSet in 1912, the film opens on Edward Malone, a junior reporter looking for an adventurous assignment. Malone is sent to interview Professor Challenger, an explorer and researcher who believes he is on the trail of the \"lost world,\" a mysterious place in Central Africa. Challenger has a picture of a cliff and a strange beast resembling a pterodactyl that is his only evidence of the place.\n\nThe British scientific community finds his claims laughable. After receiving funding from the family of Jenny Nielson, a wildlife photographer and the daughter of a rich American contributor to the sciences, the \"scientific community\" agrees to organise an exploratory expedition under the leadership of the antagonistic Professor Summerlee. Summerlee agrees to Malone and Nielson coming on the expedition, but refuses to allow Challenger to be part of the expedition. With obvious reluctance, Challenger gives Summerlee a \"map\" to be opened at a road-end village in Africa at a particular date and time. The expedition departs. A newsboy associate of Malone named Jim stows away on the trip.\n\nThe expedition arrives in Africa where they are joined by a female guide named Malu and a Portuguese called Gomez. Summerlee opens the map from Challenger, finding it blank, at which point Challenger appears from nowhere leaving Summerlee no option but to accept his guidance on the exhibition. Under Challenger's guidance they find the cliff in the picture and reach the top, but Gomez (who turns out to be the brother of a Portuguese who was killed on Challenger's first journey here) strands them with no way back down. Exploring the Lost World to find another way home, the team finds dinosaurs, from a pair of Anatosaurus to a pterodactyl rookery.\n\nJim, Malone, and Malu narrowly avoid being eaten by a dinosaur (presumably a Herrerasaurus), only to find that their camp was attacked and the rest of the team is gone. The three discover a gathering of native tribesmen (painted with symbolic skeletons) who regularly sacrifice humans off a cliff to the carnivorous dinosaurs. While the 'skeleton men' sacrifice a man to a \"Tyrannosaurus rex\", Malone distracts the tribe while the other explorers and captured natives escape, and they retreat to the safety of a second tribe nearby (who use clothes, not paint). During these events, Summerlee notes some oddities about the \"ritual\" vegetation necklaces that the sacrifices (themselves) were dressed in. The second tribe's members, through Malu's translation, tell the explorers about a time long ago when the shamans of their tribe convinced some to worship the carnivorous dinosaurs, splitting the tribe in two.\n\nSummerlee deduces that the vegetation necklaces placed on the sacrifices provided some necessary nutrient or immunisation to the dinosaurs which had protected these dinosaurs from the extinction that the rest of the dinosaurs suffered globally (this being a theory Summerlee had espoused previously). The expedition team uses their modern knowledge and research to benefit the tribe with irrigation and horticultural benefits, to produce the antidote to a prehistoric plague. The skeleton tribe's leader is killed, and the two tribes reunite. The chief shows the team a hidden cave that will lead them back to their world, and has them promise that they will come back if they are ever needed.\n\nReturning to the river, the team is ambushed by Gomez. Gomez is shot and wounded, but instead of killing him, Challenger leaves him behind, saying, \"Let the jungle have him.\" Malu stays in Africa, and the others return home. The Royal Zoological Society in London rules that Challenger and Summerlee have insufficient evidence of their tale, until Jim reveals that he brought back a baby pterodactyl. The team is celebrated for their achievements, but when Malone, Jenny, and Jim discover the pterodactyl (named Percival), is unhappy being kept in a zoo, they release him, allowing him to fly back to the \"lost world\".\n"}

Further distinctions may earn them the title Associate of the Inner Magic Circle (A.I.M.C.), and Member of The Inner Magic Circle (M.I.M.C) a select group limited to 300 members. The Circle was founded in 1905, and was male-only until 1991. There is a junior branch, the Young Magicians Club, which gained popularity through the success of the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nThe Magic Circle was founded in 1905 after a meeting of 23 amateur and professional magicians at London's Pinoli's Restaurant. At this founders meeting, chaired by Servais Le Roy, those present decided upon the name of the Society: it was initially felt that the name of the Society should be the Martin Chapender Club, in memory of the performer and founding member who had recently died at the age of twenty-five. However, it was then agreed that the name \"Magic Circle\" would be more appropriate and that this name shared the same initials as those of Martin Chapender.\n\nThe first official meeting was at the Green Man public house in Soho, but meetings were later in a room at St George's Hall in Langham Place, where David Devant and John Nevil Maskelyne were regularly seen performing.\n\nDevant became the first president of the Magic Circle, and in 1906, Maskelyne edited the first issue of \"The Magic Circular\" magazine, a regular feature for members ever since. The \"Magic Circular\" claims to be the longest-running regular magic magazine in conjuring history.\n\nThe club was male-only until 1991, when more than 75% of members voted to admit women. As of 2010 there were around eighty female members of the Magic Circle, including Paul Daniels' wife, Debbie McGee. In 2014, Megan Knowles-Bacon became the first female officer in the Magic Circle, as well as the youngest person to be elected as an officer; she was elected as secretary.\n\nThe motto of the society is the Latin \"indocilis privata loqui\", roughly translated as \"not apt to disclose secrets\" (lit. \"incapable [of] speaking [of] private [things]\") ; members give their word not to wilfully disclose magic secrets other than to bona fide students of magic. Anyone breaking this or any other rule may be expelled.\n\nSince 1998, the Magic Circle building in central London near Euston Station in Camden has been available for meetings and corporate entertainment. It was voted the UK's Number One Venue in the hospitality industry's Top 20 UK Venues poll 2008.\n\nThe Magic Circle's headquarters houses a theatre, library, museum, a dining room, a clubroom and bars. The museum features magic tricks, props, posters, programs, toys, photographs and artefacts related to conjuring history. Items of interest include, Robert Harbin’s original Zig Zag illusion, Chung Ling Soo's robes, an original Sooty with associated Harry Corbett apparatus, sets of props used by television magicians David Nixon and Tommy Cooper, items and a sound recording of Harry Houdini taken from an Edison cylinder, and a set of cups and balls used by HRH Charles, Prince of Wales when he took his Magic Circle exam in 1975. Visits are by arranged tour.\n\nMagicians who wish to join may spend up to two years as an Apprentice before applying for full membership. They need to have known two current members for at least one year and must be at least 18 years old. These two members are then asked to act as sponsors, or referees, on the candidate's application form and propose them as a suitable candidate for membership. Following the receipt and processing of the application, the candidate is invited to an interview with the examinations secretary, usually at the London headquarters. If the candidate proves suitable and sufficiently knowledgeable a performance exam is scheduled or a thesis may be written. The exam takes place in front of a panel of judges, and candidates must demonstrate their skills to members in a rehearsed act.\n\nIf a thesis is chosen, it is read by two examiners and a copy is made available in the Magic Circle library. The final stage is by vote by members of the Council, who will approve the candidate as a member. Once the applicant is successful, they are free to call themselves \"Members of the Society\" and use the letters M.M.C. after their name.\n\nMembers of the Magic Circle include: Charles, Prince of Wales, Luis de Matos, Michael Vincent, Dynamo, Tom London, John Archer, \n, and Stephen Fry.\n\nMembers may take a further examination to achieve the degree of Associate of the Inner Magic Circle. The designation A.I.M.C. shows this higher membership. The A.I.M.C. degree can also be attained through thesis, and in rare cases – that is when a candidate gains 18 or higher out of a possible 20 marks in the written exam – examinees taking the M.M.C. exam are awarded the A.I.M.C. degree. Those who attain an A.I.M.C. degree as a result of a performance examination are awarded the A.I.M.C. with silver star.\n\nWithin the society, there are a number of members never exceeding three-hundred known as the \"Inner Magic Circle\". Full membership of the Inner Magic Circle is denoted by the letters M.I.M.C. after the member's name. Membership of the Inner Magic Circle is by call of The Society's President. The M.I.M.C. degree may be awarded with a gold star, to signify that the recipient is a performer of magic (as opposed to e.g. an inventor, historian or noteworthy volunteer for the Society). The honour of a gold star does not necessarily signify the holder's excellence as a performer and not all recipients are performers of excellence.\n\nMembers must undertake not to reveal magic secrets to anyone except bona fide magicians, on pain of expulsion.\n\n\"The Young Magicians Club\" is part of the \"Youth Initiative of the Magic Circle\" (the other major part being the prestigious \"Young Magician of the Year Competition\") and is a club for magicians between the inclusive ages of 10 and 18 which was founded in 1996. Sponsored by the Magic Circle, members of the Young Magicians Club meet for monthly workshops at the Magic Circle Headquarters, the 'Centre for the Magic Arts' in London. \nThe Young Magicians Club has a current membership of around 200 members.\n\nThe Young Magicians Club's principal means of communication among its members is its bi-monthly magazine \"Secrets\". The worldwide membership also communicates through a members-only on-line forum on the Young Magicians Club website.\n\nMembership in The Young Magicians Club requires no interview or exam and is open to all young people interested in magic. There are monthly all-day workshops for members who come from all over the country to take part. Adult members of the Magic Circle take on the responsibility of instructing the members of the Young Magicians Club. Local adult magic clubs will often have a junior magicians club attached to them but The Young Magicians Club is the only such club associated with the Magic Circle. Members of the Young Magicians Club are eligible to join the Magic Circle at a reduced rate when they reach 18, but then they must complete the examination procedure for full membership.\n\nThe Young Magicians Club holds their annual one-day convention every October called 'J-Day'. The convention includes lectures and the finals of two competitions with awards, which include the \"Home Counties Trophy\" for stage magic, \"The Mark Leveridge Cup\" for close-up magic, \"Kaymar Komedy Cup\" and the \"Peter McCahon Award for Originality\". In recent years, the celebrity guest lectures have been presented by Derren Brown in 2010, Dynamo in 2011, John Archer in 2012, Marvin Berglas in 2013, Luis De Matos in 2014 and Dave Loosley and Andi Gladwin in 2015.\n\nThe popularity of the Harry Potter franchise was one of the key reasons for the organisation's growth this century with membership doubling after the announcement of the first film in 2001.\n\n\n\n"}

Criticism has been aimed at the newspaper has been in response to individual controversial reporters, along with alleged political bias. \n\n\"The New York Times\" used to have a public editor who acted as an ombudsman and \"investigates matters of journalistic integrity\". The sixth and last NYT public editor was Liz Spayd, who contributed her last piece in June 2017.\nIn 1999, the \"Times\" ran a series of stories about alleged theft of classified documents from Los Alamos National Lab in New Mexico. The prime suspect, Taiwan-born U.S. citizen Dr. Wen Ho Lee, had his name leaked to the \"Times\" by U.S. Energy Department officials. Dr. Lee was indicted on 59 counts and jailed in solitary confinement for 278 days until he accepted a plea bargain from the government. The alleged breach of security became a catalyst for the creation of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA, not to be confused with the NSA and the NSC). This was similar to how the 9/11 attacks led to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. Dr. Lee was released after the government's case could not be proven. \n\nPresident Clinton issued a public apology to Dr. Lee over his treatment. The federal judge in charge of the case, James Aubrey Parker, remarked that \"top decision makers in the executive branch ... have embarrassed our entire nation and each of us who is a citizen.\" Dr. Lee filed a lawsuit under the Privacy Act alleging that officials had leaked false and incriminating information to the media before charges had been filed. Dr. Lee's lawsuit was settled in 2006, just before the U.S. Supreme Court was set to decide whether to hear the case. The issues were similar to those in the Plame affair criminal investigation, when \"Times\" reporter Judith Miller spent 2½ months in jail rather than reveal her government source.\n\nOn October 12, 2001, \"Times\" reporter Judith Miller became one of several victims of alleged anthrax attacks. The book \"\", which Miller had co-authored with two other \"Times\" staffers, had been published ten days earlier on October 2. It became a top \"New York Times\" bestseller within a few weeks. Its cover art depicted a white envelope like those used in the anthrax incidents. The text, written before the September 11 attacks, made reference to Islamic jihadists: \nIn 2002, \"Times\" columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote a series of columns indirectly suggesting that Dr. Steven Hatfill, a former U.S. Army germ-warfare researcher named as a \"person of interest\" by the FBI, might be a \"likely culprit\" in the anthrax attacks. Dr. Hatfill was never charged with any crime. In 2004, Dr. Hatfill sued the \"Times\" and Kristof for libel, claiming defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. \nAfter years of proceedings, the case was dismissed in 2007, and the dismissal was upheld on appeal. In 2008, the case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court which refused to grant certiorari, effectively leaving the dismissal in place. The basis for the dismissal was that Dr. Hatfill was a \"public figure\" and he had not proved malice on the part of the \"Times\".\n\nIn 2003, the \"Times\" admitted that Jayson Blair, one of its reporters, had committed repeated journalistic fraud over a span of several years. The general professionalism of the paper was questioned, though Blair immediately resigned following the incident. Questions of affirmative action in journalism were also raised, since Blair is black. The paper's top two editors – Howell Raines, the executive editor, and Gerald M. Boyd, managing editor – resigned their posts following the incident.\n\nJudith Miller wrote a series of exclusive and prominently displayed articles \"strongly suggest[ing] Saddam Hussein already had or was acquiring an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction\" using Ahmad Chalabi as her source prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. This aided the George W. Bush administration in making the case for war.\n\nIn October 2005, \"Times\" reporter Judith Miller was released from prison after 85 days, when she agreed to testify to special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald’s grand jury after receiving a personal waiver, both on the phone and in writing, of her earlier confidential source agreement with Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby. No other reporter whose testimony had been sought in the case had received such a direct and particularized release. Her incarceration has helped fuel an effort in Congress to enact a federal shield law, comparable to the state shield laws which protect reporters in 31 of the 50 states. After her second appearance before the grand jury, Miller was released from her contempt of court finding. Miller resigned from the paper on November 9, 2005.\n\nCampusJ Jewish Collegiate News was a website covering Jewish news on college and university campuses with a network of student journalists. In March 2005, CampusJ broke the story that \"The New York Times\" had negotiated a deal with Columbia University administrators to exclude student response in an article on academic bias in exchange for exclusive access to a report. \n\nCampusJ, part of the J-Blogosphere, was launched in February 2005 by editor and publisher Steven I. Weiss of \"Canonist\". The last posting was dated May 20, 2007. By 2008, the site appeared defunct, and many of the sections had no new content for months. CampusJ's staff of student reporters covered the Jewish news on thirty or more campuses, including American University, George Washington University, McGill, Northwestern, Rutgers and Washington University, by reporting for campus-specific school homepages (blogs).\n\nOn December 16, 2005, a \"New York Times\" article revealed that the Bush administration had ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to intercept telephone conversations between suspected terrorists in the U.S. and those in other countries without first obtaining court warrants for the surveillance, apparently in violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) and without the knowledge or consent of the Congress. A federal judge recently held that the plan revealed by the \"Times\" was unconstitutional, and hearings have been held on this issue in Congress. The article noted that reporters and editors at the \"Times\" had known about the intelligence-gathering program for approximately a year but had, at the request of White House officials, delayed publication to conduct additional reporting. The Justice Department has launched an investigation to determine the sources of the classified information obtained by the \"Times\". The men who reported the stories, James Risen and Eric Lichtblau, won the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting in 2006.\n\nBecause of the lapse in reporting Edward Snowden decided not to supply the \"New York Times\" with his information, choosing to go to the \"Guardian\" and \"Washington Post\" instead.\n\nMuch controversy was caused when, on June 23, 2006, The Times (along with the Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times) revealed the existence of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, a CIA/Department of Treasury scheme to access transactional database of the Brussels-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (\"SWIFT\"). In September 2006, the Belgian government declared that the SWIFT dealings with U.S. government authorities were, in fact, a breach of Belgian and European privacy laws.\n\nOn December 22, 2006 at the request of the Bush Administration, the paper removed sections of an Op-Ed piece critical of the administration's policy towards Iran which contained publicly available information that Iran cooperated after the 9/11 attacks and offered to negotiate a diplomatic settlement in 2003.\n\nOn Monday, September 10, 2007, the \"Times\" ran a full-page advertisement for MoveOn.org questioning the integrity of General David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, entitled \"General Petraeus or General Betray Us?\" The Times only charged MoveOn.org, a liberal activist group, $65,000 for the advertisement that, according to public relations director Abbe Serphos, normally costs around $181,692, or roughly a 64% discount. Serphos declined to explain the discount.\n\nTimes spokeswoman Catherine Mathis denied the rate charged indicated a political bias and said it was the paper's policy not to disclose the rate paid by any advertiser. \"We do not distinguish the advertising rates based on the political content of the ad,\" Mathis told Reuters. \"The advertising folks did not see the content of the ad before the rate was quoted,\" she said, adding that there were over 30 different categories of ads with varying rates. Mathis confirmed the open rate for an ad of that size and type was around $181,000. Among reasons for lower rates are advertisers buying in bulk or taking a standby rate, she said. \"There are many instances when we have published opinion advertisements that run counter to the stance we take on our own editorial pages,\" she said.\n\nJeff Jarvis, a journalism professor who blogs on media at buzzmachine.com, said the key question for the Times was could any other political or advocacy group get the same rate under the same circumstances. \"The quandary the Times gets stuck in is they don't want to admit you can buy an ad for that rate, no matter who you are,\" Jarvis said, noting that with print advertising revenues in newspapers generally decline to offer big discounts.\n\nOn a more general note, Jarvis said U.S. papers should emulate their counterparts in Britain where, for example, \"The Guardian\" makes no effort to hide its liberal stance. \"In the U.S., I would argue newspapers should be more transparent and open about the views taken ... and The (New York) Times is liberal,\" he said.\n\nAdvertising Age reported that \"MoveOn bought its ad on a 'standby' basis, under which it can ask for a day and placement in the paper but doesn't get any guarantees.\" A subsequent full-page ad bought by Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani to rebut MoveOn.org's original ad was purchased at the same standby rate. MoveOn later paid \"The Times\" the full rate once the newspaper publicly acknowledged that \"an advertising sales representative made a mistake.\"\n\nIn their book \"\", Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky analyze a variety of major U.S. media outlets, with an emphasis on \"The Times\". They conclude that a bias exists which is neither liberal nor conservative in nature, but aligned towards the interests of corporate conglomerates, which own most of these media outlets and also provide the majority of their advertising revenue. The authors explain that this bias functions in all sorts of ways:\n\n\"...by selection of topics, by distribution of concerns, by emphasis and framing of issues, by filtering of information, by bounding of debate within certain limits. They determine, they select, they shape, they control, they restrict — in order to serve the interests of dominant, elite groups in the society.\"\n\nChomsky and Herman also touch on the specific importance this perceived bias has in \"The Times\", saying: \"...history is what appears in \"The New York Times\" archives; the place where people will go to find out what happened is \"The New York Times\". Therefore it's extremely important if history is going to be shaped in an appropriate way, that certain things appear, certain things not appear, certain questions be asked, other questions be ignored, and that issues be framed in a particular fashion.\"\n\nIn their 2007 book \"Until Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustice of the Duke Lacrosse Case\", KC Johnson and Stuart Taylor, Jr. sharply criticize The New York Times for their editorial judgment and its effect on the case investigation. It claims that the original reports by Joe Drape tended to exonerate the accused players, which contradicted Times' editorial stance. This led to Drape's quick dismissal and replacement by Duff Wilson who took a pro prosecution stance.\n\nAlso covering the case, sports writer Selena Roberts, made assertions, that \"Something happened March 13.\" Furthermore, Roberts writes, “Players have been forced to give up their DNA, but to the dismay of investigators, none have come forward to reveal an eyewitness account.” Johnson points out that this statement was not true. The captains’ March 28, 2006 statement or examined the defense attorneys’ subsequent press conference both described the captains’ cooperation with police, occurred before she penned her column. The Times never ran a correction. Later Roberts in an interview in the Big Lead said, \"I wrote that a crime didn’t have to occur for us to inspect the irrefutable evidence of misogyny and race baiting that went on that night.\"\n\nDaniel Okrent, former Times ombudsman admitted to the bias in the Times coverage of the case. He said, \"It was too delicious a story. It conformed too well to too many preconceived notions of too many in the press: white over black, rich over poor, athletes over non-athletes, men over women, educated over non-educated. Wow. That's a package of sins that really fit the preconceptions of a lot of us.\"\n\nThe February 21, 2008 \"The New York Times\" published an article on John McCain's alleged relationship with lobbyist Vicki Iseman and other involvement with special interest groups. The article received a widespread criticism among both liberals and conservatives, McCain supporters and non-supporters as well as talk radio personalities. Robert S. Bennett, whom McCain had hired to represent him in this matter, defended McCain's character. Bennett, who was the special investigator during the Keating Five scandal that \"The Times\" revisited in the article, said that he fully investigated McCain back then and suggested to the Senate Ethics Committee to not pursue charges against McCain.\n\n\"And if there is one thing I am absolutely confident of, it is John McCain is an honest and honest man. I recommended to the Senate Ethics Committee that he be cut out of the case, that there was no evidence against him, and I think for the New York Times to dig this up just shows that Senator McCain's public statement about this is correct. It's a smear job. I'm sorry. \" \n\nFormer staffer to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton campaigner Lanny Davis said the article \"had no merit.\" Stating that he did not support McCain's bid for the White House, Davis, who had himself lobbied for the same cause Iseman lobbied McCain for, said that McCain only wrote a letter to the FCC to ask them to \"act soon\" and refused to write a letter that supported the sale of the television station the article talked about. Journalistic observers also criticized the article, albeit in a milder language. Tom Rosenstiel, the director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, suggested that the article does not make clear the nature of McCain's alleged \"inappropriate\" behavior: \"The phrasing is just too vague.\" The article was later criticized by the White House and by several news organizations including the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" editorial board. Commentator Bill O'Reilly raised the question about why the paper had endorsed McCain on January 25, 2008 for the Republican nomination if they had information that alleged an inappropriate relationship. The \"Boston Globe\", owned by the \"Times\", declined to publish the story, choosing instead to run a version of the same story written by the competing Washington Post staff. That version focused almost exclusively on the pervasive presence of lobbyists in McCain's campaign and did not mention the sexual relationship that the Times article hinted at.\n\nIn response to the criticism, the \"Times\" editor Bill Keller was \"surprised by the volume\" and \"by how lopsided the opinion was against our decision [to publish the article]\". The diverse sentiments by the readers were summarized in a separate article by Clark Hoyt, the \"Times\" public editor, who concluded: \"I think it is wrong to report the suppositions or concerns of anonymous aides about whether the boss is getting into the wrong bed.\"\n\nIn September 2008, a McCain senior aide (Steve Schmidt) charged: \"Whatever The New York Times once was, it is today not by any standard a journalistic organization. It is a pro-Obama advocacy organization that every day impugns the McCain campaign, attacks Sen. McCain, attacks Gov. Palin. ... Everything that is read in The New York Times that attacks this campaign should be evaluated by the American people from that perspective.\"\n\nIn December 2008, Iseman filed a sued \"The New York Times\", alleging that the paper had defamed her by, in her view, falsely implying that she had an illicit romantic relationship with McCain. In February 2009, the suit \"was settled without payment and \"The Times\" did not retract the article.\" Unusually, however, \"The Times\" agreed to publish a statement from Iseman's lawyers on the \"Times\" website.\n\nAlessandra Stanley is a television critic. Complaints have been raised regarding the accuracy of her reporting. Her tribute to Walter Cronkite on July 18, 2009 had eight factual errors. Clark Hoyt, the public editor of \"The New York Times\" described Stanley as \"much admired by editors for the intellectual heft of her coverage of television\" but \"with a history of errors\". The New York Times printed a correction:\n\nAn appraisal on Saturday about Walter Cronkite’s career included a number of errors. In some copies, it misstated the date that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed and referred incorrectly to Mr. Cronkite’s coverage of D-Day. Dr. King was killed on April 4, 1968, not April 30. Mr. Cronkite covered the D-Day landing from a warplane; he did not storm the beaches. In addition, Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969, not July 26. “The CBS Evening News” overtook “The Huntley-Brinkley Report” on NBC in the ratings during the 1967-68 television season, not after Chet Huntley retired in 1970. A communications satellite used to relay correspondents’ reports from around the world was Telstar, not Telestar. Howard K. Smith was not one of the CBS correspondents Mr. Cronkite would turn to for reports from the field after he became anchor of “The CBS Evening News” in 1962; he left CBS before Mr. Cronkite was the anchor. Because of an editing error, the appraisal also misstated the name of the news agency for which Mr. Cronkite was Moscow bureau chief after World War II. At that time it was United Press, not United Press International.\nAn earlier contentious wording was on September 5, 2005 in an article on Hurricane Katrina where she wrote \"Fox's Geraldo Rivera did his rivals one better: yesterday, he nudged an Air Force rescue worker out of the way so his camera crew could tape him as he helped lift an older woman in a wheelchair to safety.\" The Times later acknowledged that no nudge was visible on the broadcast tape.\n\nIn 2017, the \"New York Times\" was criticized for an article, headlined \"How Vital Are Women? This Town Found Out as They Left to March,\" about fathers from Montclair, New Jersey who looked after their children while their wives participated in the Women's March. To some, the article \"seemed to reinforce three old-fashioned tropes about gender and parenting: Men can’t handle parenting tasks; men who manage to handle the basics of parenting are exceptional and worthy of a news story; and parenting is fundamentally the work of women.\" The freelance writer who wrote the story apologized, and the Metro section editor stated: \"It was a bad idea from the get-go. It was conceived with the best intentions, but it fell flat. And I regret it.\"\n\nQuotation symbols were put around \"terrorist\" by the New York Times when describing the 2014 Kunming attack.\n\nOutdated figures about the carbon output of China were used by the New York Times in a 2015 article.\n\nThe newspaper's coverage of India has been heavily criticized by Sumit Ganguly, a professor of political science, for its \"hectoring\" and \"patronizing\" tone towards India. He finds anti-India bias in coverage of the Kashmir Conflict, the Hyde Act and other India-related matters. Similar charges of racism against Indians have been levelled at the \"Huffington Post.\"\n\nUnited States lawmaker Kumar P. Barve described a recent editorial on India as full of \"blatant and unprofessional factual errors or omissions\" and having a \"haughty, condescending, arrogant and patronizing\" tone. In September 2014, The New York Times published a cartoon showing a stereotypical Indian turban-wearing man with a cow knocking at the door of an \"elite space club\". This was their response to recent accomplishments by the Indian Space Research Organization. The cartoon \"drew immediate criticism for being racist in content, and for engaging in classist and racist stereotyping\". \n\nThe New York Times has also opposed India's entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group while the US administration led by President Barack Obama was actively supporting India's membership. This view was criticized for Indophobic bias by several western and Indian experts on nuclear issues. The New York Times has also published editorials attacking traditional Indian dress as a \"conspiracy by Hindu Nationalists\", which was widely criticized for ignorance and for promoting Orientalism.\n\nIn 2018 the New York Times came under criticism, including from the tourist office of the city of York, for describing Yorkshire pudding as a \"large, fluffy pancake\" and recommending it be served with \"syrup, preserves, confectioners' sugar or cinnamon sugar\". A presenter for the BBC stated that the Yorkshire pudding's history was longer than that of the USA.\n\nOn May 24, 2017, \"The New York Times\" caused outrage among the British police and government when it published leaked photos showing the scene of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. Counter terror police chiefs said the leak undermined their investigation and victims' and witnesses' confidence. \"The New York Times\" published photos it says were gathered by UK authorities at the scene of the attack, including the remnants of a backpack, nuts and screws, and a device identified as a \"possible detonator\". Greater Manchester Police were said to be \"furious\" and said they would stop sharing information with the US. President Donald Trump the next day in a NATO summit condemned the media leaks, calling it \"deeply troubling\" and a \"grave threat to our national security\". \"The New York Times\" defended its decision to publish the photos, saying they were \"neither graphic nor disrespectful of victims\".\n\nCaliphate, a podcast for the New York Times, has received numerous criticism after Abu Huzaifa al-Kanadi admitted on the podcast that he “murdered people” while he was fighting for the Islamic State group. Numerous conservatives called for action against him after his statement, including Candice Bergen. She criticized the liberal government after not ordering law enforcement against him. Bergen also called for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale to reveal whether the government knows where he is or not, but Goodale stated that it was the “opposition of keeping Canadians safe”. Huzaifa also received concerns from television journalist Diana Swain that he may be “lying” to The New York Times or CBC News.\n\nAfter the \"Times\" tweeted a cartoon portraying Trump and Putin as a gay lovers, LGBT activist and Democratic Rep. Brian Sims said it's time to stop the homophobic jokes. American transgender activist Jeffrey Marsh said \"to have a group that's as well-established as The New York Times personally attacking you feels horrendous.\" \n\nA spokesperson for \"The Times\" defended the animation.\n\nIn August 2018, \"The New York Times\" hired Sarah Jeong to join its editorial board as lead writer on technology, commencing in September. The hiring sparked a strongly negative reaction in conservative media, which highlighted derogatory tweets about white people that Jeong had posted mostly in 2013 and 2014. Critics characterized her tweets as being racist; Jeong said that the posts were \"counter-trolling\" in reaction to harassment she had experienced, and that she regretted adopting this tactic. The \"Times\" stated that it had reviewed her social media history before hiring her, and that it did not condone the posts.\n\n\n"}
