{"id": "16173789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16173789", "title": "Bangai-O Spirits", "text": "Bangai-O Spirits\n\nBangai-O Spirits is an action game for the Nintendo DS, and the sequel to \"Bangai-O\" which was released on the Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast.\n\n\"Bangai-O Spirits\" is a side-scrolling shooting game with free-scrolling levels that extend horizontally and vertically. The player controls a robot with the ability to fly, but is still affected by gravity. He has seven weapons to choose from, and can perform melee attacks using a baseball bat or sword.\n\nThe game has 160 levels, and features a level editor to create more. Edited levels can be encoded in a sound that can be recorded with a computer and shared between players. This technology was inspired by the datacasettes used by some older computers, including the Sharp X1 on which Matsumoto learned to program.\n\nBangai-O Spirits has very little story line, and is not part of the same continuity as the previous game. The two new pilots are called Masato (boy) and Ruri (girl). The campaign mode is limited to a brief set of tutorial stages.\n\nUpon completing all of the stages under \"Treasure's Best\" in free mode, a brief cutscene will play, with one of the characters saying \"We're only here because the fanboys would throw a fit on the internet if the game didn't have an ending.\"\n\nIn a rare breach of the company's usual secrecy about future plans, developer Yoshiyuki Matsumoto first hinted at a sequel to \"Bangai-O\" in a 2003 interview on Sega's website to promote the game \"\". When asked what game he would like to create next, he said he would like to \"carry out \"Bakuretsu Muteki Bangai-O's\" revenge.\" \n\nTreasure began working on a concept demo before a publisher was involved. Full production followed the completion of their previous handheld release, \"\". When publisher ESP approached them about a possible collaboration, \"Bangai-O\" seemed like a logical fit. On September 11, 2007, Weekly Famitsu announced the game officially, and it was demonstrated at Tokyo Game Show later that month.\n\nOn August 12, 2008, the game has been released in North American by D3 Publisher of America.\n\nTreasure has handled the localization for the game in-house, adding features they did not have time to include in the Japanese release. Treasure previously did this with the North American version of \"\", which featured new enemies, difficulty modes, and refined level layouts, and is generally considered a stronger product than the original Japanese version.\n\nThe player is able to choose two weapons from a list that includes various missiles, melee weapons, and a defensive shield.\n\nThe player is also able to choose two EX weapons from a list of homing, napalm, rebound, break, direction, reflector, and freeze. The use of the EX Attack unleashes loads of missiles. More missiles will be fired the longer one charges the attack, and the closer one is to enemy projectiles. The exception is the freeze EX Attack, which \"freezes\" the screen, but this is still affected by the amount of projectiles en route to the player. The direction EX attack sends all of the attack at a single enemy, while the reflector EX attack reflects all the enemy fire.\n\nAlso added is the ability for the player to dash. While dashing the player moves forward faster than normal and is able to both damage and travel through enemies and scenery but cannot fire.\n\nA new defensive skill is the ability to knockback enemies and objects. The bat, dash, and reflect EX are the only ways to knockback enemies. Enemies that are knockedback can knockback other enemies which could cascade into a very large and damaging \"wave\" of knockedback enemies.\n\n\"GameSpot\" gave the game 8/10. \"Hardcore Gamer\" praised its simplicity, while \"Eurogamer\" called it \"glorious, eclectic, furiously inventive, dizzying, baffling, confusing, witty, clever and beautiful\" and gave it solid 10 out of 10. \"Game Revolution\" compared the game to \"Geometry Wars\" and ranked it 4.5 out of 5.\n\nRon Burke of \"Gaming Trend\" mentioned that he was surprised that this game allows him to load sounds, a feature he says, is absent in other games.\n\nIt was a nominee for Best Shooting Game and Best Use of Sound for the Nintendo DS by IGN in their 2008 video game awards.\n\n"}
{"id": "5067940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5067940", "title": "Blaster Master: Blasting Again", "text": "Blaster Master: Blasting Again\n\nBlaster Master: Blasting Again (known simply as Blaster Master in Japan) is the fifth game in the \"Blaster Master\" series. It was released for the PlayStation. The release of the original game had a different plot, but this title is a follow-up to the \"Worlds of Power\" adaptation in all regions. It was released in Japan on July 13, 2000, and was supposed to be released in North America on November 7, 2000, but issues with the game caused it to be delayed until it got a release on May 6, 2001.\n\n\"Blaster Master: Blasting Again\" is a third-person 3D platformer that puts the player at the controls of the high-tech, all-terrain combat vehicle SOPHIA J-7. The player navigates through several areas of caverns to uncover and ultimately stop the treacherous plans of a mysterious alien race of Lightning Beings. On some occasions the player's character must exit SOPHIA and go solo through alien complexes. As the game progresses, the player will earn upgrades for SOPHIA, and be able to salvage weapon upgrades for the pilot. The player views cut-scenes that convey the key elements in the story. The character will fight a boss at the end of each stage.\n\nAlthough the game is a sequel to the original \"Blaster Master\" for the NES, the writers of \"Blasting Again\" used elements from the \"Worlds of Power\" novelization of \"Blaster Master\" in the game's storyline. Particularly, the character of Eve, an original character from the novel who was not in the NES game, was introduced in \"Blasting Again\" as the wife of Jason and the mother of Roddy and Elfie. The novel's author, Peter Lerangis, felt \"honored\" for the privilege.\n\nThere once was a boy named Jason, who had a pet frog. One day the frog, bored with his microenvironment, decided to explore the world. Hopping outside, he fell into a mysterious hole in the backyard. The tiny frog landed on a pile of boxes containing radioactive materials. The exposure to the materials led to an immediate mutation, and the frog swelled to ten times his original size. Unfazed, the big frog hopped off down the mysterious tunnel he found himself in, to see what he could see. Jason, meanwhile, upset at his pet's disappearance, began searching frantically. He too found the mysterious hole, but when he reached the bottom, there was a strange vehicle waiting for him - Sophia III. And, since nobody else was around, Jason thought he'd drive Sophia around to look for his frog. Donning a battle suit he finds with the vehicle, Jason embarks on a journey that will forever change his life.\n\nJason encounters an alien race, known as the Lightning Beings, living in caverns beneath the Earth's crust. These aliens have begun preparations for a hostile takeover of the planet. Luckily for humanity, Jason \"really\" wants his frog back. Eventually Jason squares off with the mighty Plutonium Boss, leader of the Lightning Beings, and defeats him. The aliens, leaderless, scatter, and from afar, Jason watches as their world collapses upon them...watches with Sophia, and his frog.\n\nBut Jason's combat with the Lightning Beings was far from over. He learns that Sophia is actually a combat vehicle developed by another alien race trying to stop the parasitic exploits of the Lightning Beings. Teaming up with Eve, an alien Sophia pilot, Jason sallies forth to mop up the remaining Lightning Beings. Successful in combat, with the prospect of lasting peace before them, Jason and Eve marry and settle on Earth, and have two children named Elfie and Roddy.\n\nFive years ago, Eve died. A couple of years later, Jason is killed in a ferocious attack by Lightning Beings. With the planet threatened by mysterious geologic phenomena and natural disasters, Elfie and Roddy take up the legacy of their parents, and, though young and with little experience, pledge to protect humanity from the evil machinations of the Lightning Beings. Sophia has been modified and rebuilt through the years, by both Jason and Elfie, and now exists as Sophia J-7. Elfie continues to develop new parts to upgrade Sophia's abilities. The story begins with Elfie sending Roddy in on a standard surveillance mission...\n\nThe player's character is Roddy, a sixteen-year-old boy at the helm of an all-terrain combat vehicle, SOPHIA. The player pilots SOPHIA through a labyrinth of rooms in search of clues to the enemy's movements. Occasionally the player will encounter enemy installations or limiting topography that will force Roddy to leave Sophia, and advance on foot. As the game progresses, new equipment will be made available for SOPHIA, allowing access to new areas.\n\nThe gameplay is based primarily on using jumps and maneuvering to traverse obstacles while simultaneously battling foes. Since the player is punished implicitly for missing jumps over bottomless pits this game can be considered within the genre of 3D platformers. The camera follows the SOPHIA's viewing angle when in the vehicle, but having dismounted, the camera must be controlled manually by the player. Targeting while running may therefore be seen by some as difficult because of the combination of having to adjust the camera pan angle manually. This difficulty can be exacerbated by the fact that when the player chooses to move laterally from the angle the character is facing, strafing is done literally by jumping. This means that once the player has committed to dodging in a certain direction, it cannot be changed. Unlike SOPHIA, the player cannot initiate a lateral dodge movement after leaving the ground. The graphics are typical of the 32-bit gaming era, and models are original and varied. The game has a load sequence between each room or when transferring Roddy back to SOPHIA when on foot. Load times can be shortened if playing on a PS2 by changing the disc speed on the PS driver from within the PlayStation BIOS. Sound effects tend to be recycled throughout the game, and each level has its own background theme music.\n\nBosses are large creatures with separate health gauges for their various limbs, components, or parts. Bosses will be encountered both while driving Sophia and while exploring outside the vehicle.\n\nThe game received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.\n\n"}
{"id": "433946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=433946", "title": "Border Morris", "text": "Border Morris\n\nBorder Morris is a collection of individual local dances from villages along the English side of the Wales–England border in the counties of Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. They are part of the Morris dance tradition.\n\nThis was a village dance done in winter for fun and a bit of money. It usually includes three to twelve dancers.\n\nSome of the earliest accounts of a border morris tradition are provided by E.C. Cawte. There is reference to questions about \"any disguised persons, as morice dancers, maskers, or mum'ers\" to St. Mary's Parish Church in Shrewsbury in 1584 and an amazing account of morris dancers at Hereford races in 1609, describing \"two musicians, four whifflers, and twelve dancers, including hobby horse and maid marian\", all from villages within 14 miles of Hereford. The account claimed, \"Hereford-shire for a morris-daunce puts downe, not onely all Kent, but verie neare (if one had line enough to measure it) three quarters of Christendome\".\n\nCawte quotes further accounts describing complaints to the local magistrates about disruptive morris dancers in Longdon, disrupting the Sabbath day from 1614 to 1617 and another account of dancers in Much Wenlock in 1652, causing a disturbance in an ale house at Nordley. Later records from Shrewsbury mention payment to the \"Bedlam Morris\" in 1688 and 1689.\n\nThe dance depends on the numbers available, as at Brimfield. The dances collected from a particular place sometimes differ quite markedly between informants, as at White Ladies Aston, reflecting the flexibility from year to year. Sometimes a gang would only have one dance, sometimes two, or as at Malvern and Pershore an indeterminate set of figures.\nThe common features are the rather short sticks and sometimes a stick and handkerchief version of the same dance, also usually a high single step akin to the local country dance step. Such detail as starting foot rules and phrase endings are notable for their apparent absence. \n\nSome of these village sides blackened their faces. There is no record of any sides dancing together. A few – both Upton-upon-Severn dances for example – matched the complexity of Cotswolds Morris, but many – e.g. Bromsberrow Heath – had a stark simplicity of one figure and one chorus repeated forever.\n\nIn the 1960s, E.C. Cawte, the folklorist, proposed that these dances from the English side of the Welsh borders – Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire – constituted a Welsh border tradition.\nSince the 1960s and with further collecting in the 1970s by people such as Dave Jones (late of Silurian Morris, founded 1969, and later the Not For Joes) and Keith Francis (of Silurian Morris) a distinctive border morris style has grown. The tradition is characterised by black faces, tattered shirts or coats, lots of stick-clashing and a big band traditionally comprising melodeons, fiddles, concertinas, triangles and tambourines, although they now often also feature a tuba or sousaphone, and flute or oboe.\n\nUnder the guidance of Dave Jones and Keith Francis, Silurian Border Morris sought to interpret the collected dance material, preserving as much of the traditional styles and features as can be deduced. By contrast, in 1975, John Kirkpatrick created a new border tradition with the Shropshire Bedlams, which seeks to capture the spirit of the border sides, but not recreate any specific tradition or dance. Their dances feature much \"whooping\" and this has become characteristic amongst many other border sides. Perhaps in keeping with the original tradition, the Original Welsh Border Morris (founded 1973) meet only once a year, at Christmas, and dance the traditional dances of Herefordshire and Worcestershire. With many of the newer sides, the dances have often become complex, involving many invented and evolved steps, figures and choruses.\n\nMany dances were collected by Cecil Sharp and later collectors, and several were included in Bacon's book, but border morris was largely neglected by revival morris sides until late in the 20th century. The Silurian Morris Men of Ledbury, Herefordshire, included border dances in performances from the early 1970s and changed exclusively to border morris in 1979, and the Shropshire Bedlams were founded in 1975; both became pioneers of a resurgence of border morris among revival sides in the following decades.\nThe Leominster Morris were reformed in 1988, split from The Breinton Morris (who disbanded after a further 10 years) and made contact with one of the musicians from the previous side from the 1930s, Tom Postons. His recollections of the dancing of the time as having \"lots of bowing, hat-raising, and clashing of sticks on the ground\" led to the \"revival\" of Postons' stick dance. Cecil Sharp visited the town on 27 December 1909 with local folklorist Ella Mary Leather, and collected tunes from the prolific local gypsy fiddler John Locke. The Leominster men use several of Locke's tunes in their repertoire today.\n\nBorder morris dancing was different on the Welsh side of the border, and a team on the Welsh side was formed in 1992. Initially the side was named Morys ar y Clwt but it was changed to Carreg-las in 1997. They use traditional Welsh and English folk and morris dance tunes. \"Carreg-las\" translates from the Welsh as 'bluestone', a rock found locally in the Preseli Mountains, of which it is said Stonehenge was constructed.\n\nThe origins of the blackface are much debated and remain unclear. However, various theories exist, and these are discussed below.\n\nThe term \"morris\" is believed to be from the late Middle English word \"morys\", a variant of the word \"moorish\" – from the Moors of Morocco; this explanation was cited as early as 1801.\n\nCarved figures from 1480 in Munich, Germany, show \"Moriskentänzer\" with bells, including one of the ten extant having African features. Later evidence from France includes this quote from Thoinot Arbeau circa 1580: \"In fashionable society when I was young, a small boy, his face daubed with black and his forehead swathed in a white or yellow handkerchief, would make an appearance after supper. He wore leggings covered with little bells and performed a morris\". However, the precise linkage between the morris in France and England at that time remains unclear. Henry VII may have become familiar with French morris during his time in France, and is recorded as having morris at his own court in England (see below).\n\nAnother theory is that the blackface tradition derives from earlier forms of the dance involving a Moroccan king and his followers. There is recorded evidence from 1688 of payments in Shrewsbury of 10 shillings to \"Ye Bedlam Morris\" and 2 shillings for \"Ye King of Morocco\".\n\nEvidence of the 18th-century association of black faces with morris is given by the description of the Betley Window (a stained-glass window in Betley Hall, Staffordshire, from around 1621, depicting morris dancers) by its owner, George Tollet (1725–1779). Writing in 1778, he states \"we are authorised ... to call some of the representations on my window, Morris Dancers, though I am uncertain whether it exhibits one Moorish personage, as none of them have black or tawny faces, nor do they brandish swords or staves in their hands, nor are they, in their shirts adorned with ribbons.\"\n\nGallop (1934) questions the Moorish link, quoting both Douce and Cecil Sharp who felt the English dance was too dissimilar in style and appearance to be derived from the continental European Moorish dances believed to be of Moorish origin. Sharp himself appears to have changed his view between 1906, when he saw a link between the black faces of English morris and the dancers on the Franco–Spanish border, and 1912, when he viewed the dance to be a pan-European custom possibly corrupted by Moorish influence. He argued that the name \"Moorish\" was used as a description of an existing earlier tradition, not because the dancers represented Moors. Gallop goes on to examine the linkage between the English morris dance and the \"mouriscada\" or \"morisca\" dances of Spain and Portugal, which involve ritual, choreographed battles between the Christians and Moors or Turks, often to music, involving swords and handkerchiefs. Gallop asks whether the Christian–Moorish link is actually a later interpretation of earlier pagan mock battles between Summer and Winter, such as that fought on May Day on the Isle of Man between the Queens of Summer and Winter. He argues that in parts of Portugal and the Basque Country, the word \"moor\" is also used to mean 'pagan', and that perhaps \"morris dance\" originally meant 'pagan dance', and that bells and disguised faces are a common feature of pagan ritual. Thus, for Gallop, the Moorish link is coincidental and the true origins are much older and pagan. This view remains popular for many today.\n\nBlackface and disguise, often in a pagan themed context have their own history which intersects with morris tradition. There is evidence from the 1450s onward of the blackening of faces with charcoal as a means to evade identification, and in association with pagan themes. In the Kent and Essex enclosure riots of 1450–51 men cross-dressed as 'Queen of the Fairies' (similar to the related Doamna Zînelor, of the Călușari) including those wearing blackface.\nAn event which took place in the autumn of 1450 illustrates well the way in which the often separate activities of poaching and protest could on occasion conflate. On October 1450 a large group of men entered the duke of Buckingham's park at Penshurst in Kent and carried off eighty-two deer. Thirty-two men, nineteen of them yeomen, were named in subsequent indictment which made clear that a good number had escaped by its claim that there had been a total of a hundred present (not a figure to be taken too literally). These armed men had charcoaled faces, wore long false beards and withheld their names, calling themselves servants of the Queen of the Fairies.\nThe Rebels' Proclamation of 1489 following on the Black Act a few years prior, provides another contemporary example of disguise in British folk tradition.\nIn a letter of May 1489 to his brother John Paston III, William Paston III included a copy of the proclamation issued by the rebels shortly after the murder of the earl of Northumberland. Addressing the 'Northe partys of England', this proclamation summoned 'euery lorde, knyght, esquyer, gentylman, and yeman' to array themselves 'for to geynsstonde suche persons as is abowtward for to dystroy owre suffereyn lorde the Kynge and the Comowns of Engelond for suche vnlawfull poyntys as Synt Thomas of Cauntyrbery dyed for'. Becket could have been invoked because of his reputed championing of the interests of the poor, or because of his defence of ecclesiastical privileges. Such interpretations assume that 'vnlawfull' was a hostile interpolation made by William of Paston or his source, yet Becket's martyrdom was universally admired: a more conventional invocation of Becket during the protests in Kent in 1496 paired him with St George. Moreover, the proclamation was issued in the name of a local hobgoblin, 'Mayster Hobbe Hyrste, Robyn God-felaws brodyr'. Protesters adopted such fictive personas not only to conceal identity but also perhaps to associate their grievances with Everyman and to invoke a popular culture of misrule. Elsewhere we find a 'queen of the fairies' leading a rising and her 'servants' poaching; indeed, the first 'black act' against poaching when disguised passed in 1486.\nBarbara Lowe's (1957) review of early records of the morris in England cites one of the earliest recorded mentions of the morris in England, with Henry VII paying \"Master Wentworth £6 13s. 4d. 'towards the making of a disguising for a morysse'\" in September 1501. She goes on to describe later accounts of Henry VIII's Shrovetide banquet for ambassadors in 1509, in which the torchbearers \"were appareyled in crymosen satyne and grene lyke Moreskoes, their faces blacke\". The following year, in 1510, \"there was a Pageant like a mountain, out of which came a Lady of Gold, and the children of honour called the Henchemen, which were freshly disguysed, and danced a Morice before the Kyng\".\n\nLowe (1957) also quotes from \"The Booke of all maner of Orders concerning an Erles House\", dating from around 1510, which provides rules for \"plays, interludes and disguisings, including Morrises\" and states, \"If a Morris is to be performed, it should take place after the disguising\". Thus the link to blackened faces, and between morris dance and disguise, is clearly established by the early 16th century, although the nature of that disguise is broader than simply a black face, and includes all manner of elaborate costumes.\n\nE. C. Cawte's (1963) seminal work on morris dancing in Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire quotes \"A History of Shrewsbury\" regarding the Visitation at St. Mary's Parish Church, Shrewsbury, in 1584, when it was asked, \"Whether there have bene any lords of mysrule, or somer lords and ladies, or any disguised persons, as morice dancers, maskers or mumm'ers, or such lyke, within the parishe, ether in the nativititide or in som'er, or at any other tyme, and what be their names?\" It is thus clear that in Shrewsbury, on the Welsh border, morris dancers were associated with disguise in the 16th century.\n\nThe explanation of disguise is also given for the blackface in the later periods, and that during the hard winters of the 17th and 18th century, out of work labourers and builders sought to anonymously supplement their income by a bit of dancing and begging. The use of blackface as a form of disguise is established in early 18th-century England. In 1723 it became a capital offence under the Waltham \"Black Act\" to appear \"in disguise, either by mask or by blackened face\". Certainly by the 17th century, border morris seems to have degenerated into a source of public nuisance, as many of Lowe's (1957) primary accounts recall.\n\nChloe Metcalfe (2013) and Richard Carlin (2008) question the link between the American minstrel shows into Victorian England in the late 1830s and the morris. By the early 20th century, border morris dancing was referred to colloquially by some as \"nigger dancing\" or \"going niggering\". Some view this as direct evidence of the link with minstrel shows.\n\nTheresa Buckland's (1990) research details the linkages between the 19th-century Lancashire Britannia Coco-nut Dancers and minstrel shows, although it does not discuss any link to Welsh border morris. She argued, \"The 'disguise' function of the costume has most likely been influences by Cecil Sharp's [1911] interpretation of the black face [...] which has been repeated in various publications and ephemera of the English Folk Dance and Song Society ... The dancers have been exposed to information from these publications, whether first-hand or further removed.\" The argument of disguise is used to \"explain away\" the blackface, while the black faces of dancers have radically different symbolic potential than that of the faces of supposedly disguised labourers.\n\nAccording to the \"American Morris News\" (2005), \"It is most commonly thought that the origin and function of blackface in Morris dancing lies in primitive disguise rather than an imitation of black men. However, this is not definitely the case. Accounts of the Morris of Shakespeare's time make no mention of blackface, while the border teams contemporary with minstrel shows typically blacked up. American minstrel shows, if not the actual origin of blackface among Morris dancers, at least contributed to its popularity.\"\n\nRobert Hornback (2008) has a different viewpoint, comparing border morris to crude parodies of African tribal war dances, and cites the blackface of Morris dancing as part of racist practices in Britain that predate American minstrelsy and, in fact, contribute to the minstrel tradition.\n\nCanadian academic Pauline Greenhill, commenting on morris dancing in Canada, writes that\n\nIn an ethnographic study of Morris dancing, Greenhill states that the blackface practices of other English dances \"only underscores the colonial complicity of Morris, particularly for non-English, nonwhite audiences.\" \n\nIt is possible that the interpretation of the blackface changed over the centuries – from Moroccan mimicry, to disguise, to a minstrel-inspired costume and back to disguise. To avoid controversy, some modern sides wear masks or colour their faces in different colours in order to appease the offended.\n\nUnrelated blackface English dance traditions can be found within the UK.\n\n"}

It consists of a large body of composed popular music—such songs as \"'O sole mio\"; \"Torna a Surriento\"; \"Funiculì, Funiculà\"; \"Santa Lucia\" and others.\n\nThe Neapolitan song became a formal institution in the 1830s due to an annual song-writing competition for the Festival of Piedigrotta, dedicated to the Madonna of Piedigrotta, a well-known church in the Mergellina area of Naples. The winner of the first festival was a song entitled \"Te voglio bene assaie\"; it is traditionally attributed to the prominent opera composer Gaetano Donizetti, although an article published in 1984 by Marcello Sorce Keller shows there is no historical evidence in support of the attribution. The festival ran regularly until 1950, when it was abandoned. A subsequent Festival of Neapolitan Song on Italian state radio enjoyed some success in the 1950s but was eventually abandoned as well.\n\nThe period since 1950 has produced such songs as \"Malafemmena\" by Totò, \"Maruzzella\" by Renato Carosone, \"Indifferentemente\" by Mario Trevi and \"Carmela\" by Sergio Bruni. Although separated by some decades from the earlier classics of this genre, they have now become Neapolitan \"classics\" in their own right.\n\nMany of the Neapolitan songs are world-famous because they were taken abroad by emigrants from Naples and southern Italy roughly between 1880 and 1920. The music also was popularized abroad by performers such as Enrico Caruso, who took to singing the popular music of his native city as encores at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in the early 1900s. Caruso also recorded many of these songs, which subsequently became part of the standard repertoire for operatic tenors, and which were performed and recorded by such notable singers as Beniamino Gigli, Francesco Albanese, Franco Corelli, Mario Del Monaco, Giuseppe Di Stefano, and Tito Schipa. The Three Tenors also performed popular songs from Naples. Plácido Domingo recorded a full CD \"Italia ti amo\" of traditional and some more modern Neapolitan and Italian songs. Luciano Pavarotti recorded three albums of Neapolitan and Italian songs: \"The Best: Disc 2\", (2005), \"Pavarotti Songbook\", (1991), and \"Romantica\", (2002). Mario Lanza recorded an acclaimed selection of 12 Neapolitan songs on his 1959 album, \"Mario! Lanza At His Best\". Opera/Pop crossover tenor, Sergio Franchi recorded his very popular \"Billboard\" Top 25 RCA debut album, \"Romantic Italian Songs\" in 1962, and continued to record Neapolitan songs on most of his albums throughout his career. Andrea Bocelli recorded an album in 2009 dedicated to the style, entitled \"Incanto\".\n\nThe most important native Neapolitan performers of Neapolitan songs in the last few decades include Roberto Murolo, Bruno Venturini, Mario Trevi, Mario Abbate, Mario Merola, Giulietta Sacco, Franco Ricci, Sergio Bruni, Renato Carosone, and Mario Maglione. Murolo is known not only as a singer and guitarist, but also as a composer, scholar and collector of the music; his collection of twelve LPs, released in the 1960s, is an annotated compendium of Neapolitan song dating back to the twelfth century. Representatives of different veins, but nevertheless leading the continuing tradition of song in Neapolitan, are the jazz-rock singer-songwriter Pino Daniele and the folkloric group Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare.\n\nAn important factor in defining what makes a Neapolitan song is the matter of language. All these songs are written and performed in the Neapolitan language (Napoletano). . Although the music is sung by many non-Neapolitan singers, it is difficult to sing correctly without knowledge of the Neapolitan dialect, which is crucial in obtaining the correct inflection.The matter of dialect has not prevented a few non-Neapolitans from writing dialect versions of Neapolitan songs. The most famous example of this is \"'A vucchella\" by Gabriele D'Annunzio.\n\n\n\nMarcello Sorce Keller, “Continuing Opera with Other Means: Opera, Neapolitan Song,and Popular Music among Italian Immigrants Overseas”, \"Forum Italicum\", Vol. XLIX(2015), No 3, 1- 20.\n\n"}

{"id": "381364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=381364", "title": "Casino token", "text": "Casino token\n\nCasino tokens (also known as casino or gaming chips, checks, or cheques) are small discs used in lieu of currency in casinos. Colored metal, injection-molded plastic or compression molded clay tokens of various denominations are used primarily in table games, as opposed to metal token coins, used primarily in slot machines. Casino tokens are also widely used as play money in casual or tournament games.\n\nSome casinos also use rectangular gaming plaques for high-stakes table games ($25,000 and above). Plaques differ from chips in that they are larger, usually rectangular in shape and contain serial numbers.\n\nMoney is exchanged for tokens in a casino at the casino cage, at the gaming tables, or at a cashier station. The tokens are interchangeable with money at the casino. They generally have no value outside of the casino, but certain businesses (such as taxis or waiters—especially for tips) in gambling towns may honor them informally.\n\nTokens are employed for several reasons. Because of the uniform size, shape, and patterns of stacks of chips, they are easier to tally compared to currency. This attribute also enables the pit boss or security to quickly verify the amount being paid, reducing the chance that a dealer might incorrectly pay a customer. The uniform weight of the casino's official tokens allows them to weigh great stacks or heaps of chips rather than tally them (though aids such as chip trays are far more common.) Furthermore, it is observed that consumers gamble more freely with replacement currencies than with cash. A more pragmatic reason for casinos using chips in place of cash at table games is to discourage players from grabbing back their bet and attempting to flee should their bet not win, because chips, unlike cash, must be redeemed at the casino cashier and have no value outside the casino in question. Lastly, the chips are considered to be an integral part of the casino environment, and replacing them with some alternate currency would be unpopular.\n\nMany casinos have eliminated the use of metal tokens (and coins) in their slot machines, in favor of paper receipts or pre-paid cards, which, while requiring heavy infrastructure costs to install, eliminate the coin handling expenses, jamming problems encountered in machines which took coins or tokens and can allow more game-specific technology in the space of a machine which would usually be dedicated to coin mechanisms. While some casinos (such as the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas) which installed the receipt system had kept the $1 tokens around for use as $1 chips, most other casinos using the receipts had simply scrapped the tokens entirely. Most casinos using receipts have automated machines at which customers may redeem receipts, eliminating the need for coin counting windows and decreasing labor costs.\n\nCasino chip collecting is a part of numismatics, more specifically as specialized exonumia collecting. This hobby has become increasingly popular with the Casino Chips & Gaming Tokens Collectors Club formed in 1988. Some collectors may value certain casino tokens up to $100,000, which are typically traded on online auction websites like eBay. Several casinos sell custom-made sets of chips and one or two decks of cards stamped with the name of the casino on them. Each set is contained in a small briefcase or box.\n\nThe ancestors of the modern casino token were the counters used to keep score in the card games Ombre and Quadrille. In 1752, French Quadrille sets contained a number of different counters, known as \"jetons\", \"fiches\" and \"mils\". Unlike modern poker chips, they were colored differently only to determine player ownership for purposes of settling payments at the end of the game, with different denominations differentiated by different shapes that each counter type had.\n\nIn the early history of Poker during the 19th century, players seemed to use any small valuable object imaginable. Early poker players sometimes used jagged gold pieces, gold nuggets, gold dust, or coins as well as \"chips\" primarily made of ivory, bone, wood, paper, and a composition made from clay and shellac. Several companies between the 1880s and the late 1930s made clay composition poker chips. There were over 1000 designs from which to choose. Most chips were white, red, blue, and yellow, but they could be made in almost any color desired.\n\nThe vast majority of authentic casino chips are \"clay\" chips but can be more accurately described as compression molded chips. Contrary to popular belief, no gaming chip going as far back as the 1950s has been 100% clay. Modern clay chips are a composition of materials more durable than clay alone. At least some percentage of the chips is of an earthen material such as sand, chalk, and clay similar to that found in cat litter. The process used to make these chips is a trade secret, and varies slightly by manufacturer, most being relatively expensive and time-consuming per chip. The edge spots, or inserts, are not painted on; to achieve this effect, this area of the clay is removed and then replaced with clay of a different color; this can be done to each chip individually or a strip can be taken out of a cylindrical block of material and replaced with the alternate color before the block is cut into chips. Then each chip receives a mid-inlay if desired, and is placed in a special mold that heats and compresses the chip at approximately 10,000 psi (70 MPa) at , hence the term compression molded chips.\n\nThe printed graphics on clay chips is called an inlay. Inlays are typically made of paper and are then clad with a plastic film applied to the chip prior to the compression molding process. During the molding process the inlay becomes permanently fastened to the chip and can not be removed from the chip without destroying the inlay.\n\nCeramic chips were introduced in the mid 1980s as alternative to clay chips, and are also used in casinos, as well as being readily available to the home market. The ability to print lettering and graphics on the entire surface of the chip, instead of just the inlay, made them popular. Ceramic chips are sometimes also referred to as clay or clay composite, but they are in fact an injection-molded chip made with a special plastic or resin formula that approximates the feel and sound of ceramic or porcelain. There are less expensive chips for the home market, made from various forms of plastic and plastic covered metal slugs as well.\n\nThe chips used in North American casinos typically weigh about 10 grams, but are usually between 8 and 10.5 g. Companies that manufacture chips for actual casinos include Gaming Partners International (whose subdivisions include Paulson, Bud Jones, and B&G), Classic Poker Chips, Palm Gaming International, Game On Chip Company and GTI Gaming.\n\nThere is no universally standardized color scheme for poker chip values, and schemes not only vary nationally and regionally, but even from venue to venue, or by event type within a single venue.\n\nChip colors found in home sets typically include red, white, blue, and sometimes green and black; however, more recently a wide assortment of colors have become readily available, particularly in lower-cost ABS plastic chips. Common additional colors are pink, purple, yellow, orange, and grey. Newer designs in home chips include three-color designs where a three-step molding process creates a chip with unique base, secondary, and detail colors. As chip sets are tailored to the buyer, the values of various colors vary widely, with less traditional colors either used as very high values such as $500, $1000, $5000, and so forth, common in tournaments, or as special \"fractional\" values such as $2 or $0.50, common in low-limit games.\n\nIn casinos, uniform chip colors and sizes are sometimes specified by the local gaming control board for consistency. For example, regulations in New Jersey and Illinois specify similar uniform colors. Notably, Nevada has no regulations regarding color, which is why Nevada casinos may use white, blue, or gray as $1, though $5 and greater are almost always consistently colored. All US states where gambling is legal require that casino chips have a unique combination of edge spots for identification, the name and location of the casino and the chip's value, if any, impressed, printed, or molded onto the obverse and reverse of the token.\n\nIn 19th-century America, there was enough of a tradition of using blue chips for higher values that \"blue chip\" in noun and adjective senses signaling high-value chips and high-value property are attested since 1873 and 1894, respectively. This established connotation was first extended to the sense of a blue-chip stock in the 1920s.\n\n$2.50 chips (colloquially referred to as \"snappers\" by chip collectors) are mostly used for blackjack tables, since a \"natural\" (a 21 on the first two cards dealt to a player) typically pays 3:2 and most wagers are in increments of $5. However, the Tropicana Casino and Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and others, have used $2.50 (pink) chips in $7.50 to $15 and $10 to $20 poker games.\n\n$20 chips are used mostly at baccarat and pai gow poker because a 5% commission charged for all winning banker wagers at baccarat and winning wagers at pai gow converts evenly. Bets of $20 are not uncommon in traditional table games such as craps and roulette; a $20 chip, for example, places a $5 bet on each of the \"hard ways\" in craps and is preferable to passing a stack of chips or making change.\n\nBecause eight is considered a lucky number in Chinese culture, chips denominated 8, 88, and 888 (e.g., $8 in the US) are common in casinos catering to a Chinese clientele, often as a promotion for the Chinese Lunar New Year. They will sometimes contain an image of the animal associated with the year and are issued in a variety of colors.\n\nLow-denomination yellow chips vary in value: $20 in Atlantic City and Illinois (which also uses \"mustard yellow\" $0.50 chips); $5 at most Southern California poker rooms; $2 at Foxwoods' poker room in Ledyard, Connecticut; Running Aces Harness Park and Canterbury Park, both in Minnesota; and at Casino del Sol in Tucson, Arizona; and $0.50 at Potawatomi Casino in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Blue chips are occasionally used for $10, most notably in Atlantic City. In Las Vegas and California, most casinos use blue or white for $1 chips, though many Las Vegas casinos now use $1 metal tokens in lieu of chips.\n\nChips are also available in denominations of $1000 or more, depending on the wagering limits of the casino. Such chips are often yellow or orange.. Casinos in Nevada, Atlantic City, and other areas that permit high wagers typically have chips available in $5000, $10,000, $25,000, and more; the colors for these vary widely.\n\nDenominations above $5000 are almost never encountered by the general public; their use is usually limited to \"high limit rooms\" where bet sizes are much greater than on the main floor. Casinos often use gaming plaques for these denominations: These plaques are about the size of a playing card, and must be marked with serial numbers. The greatest value placed on a plaque to date is $10 million, used at the London Club in Las Vegas.\n\nTelevised poker tournaments and cash games sometimes use bundled paper bills for high denominations, though the World Series of Poker and the World Poker Tour use round chips exclusively with denominations up to $250,000; tournament chips, however, are not redeemable for cash.\n\nEuropean casinos use a similar scheme, though certain venues, such as the Aviation Club de France, use pink for €2 and blue for €10. European casinos also use plaques rather than chips for high denominations, usually in the €1000 and higher range.\n\nEach casino has a unique set of chips, even if the casino is part of a greater company. This distinguishes a casino's chips from others, since each chip and token on the gaming floor has to be backed up with the appropriate amount of cash. In addition, with the exception of Nevada, casinos are not permitted to honor another casino's chips.\n\nThe security features of casino chips are numerous. Artwork is of a very high resolution or of photographic quality. Custom color combinations on the chip edge (edge spots) are usually distinctive to a particular casino. UV markings can be made on the inlay. Certain chips incorporate RFID technology, such as those at the Wynn Casino in Las Vegas. Also, makers' marks are difficult to reproduce. Also being used by one manufacturer, Palm Gaming, is an audible taggant incorporated into the ceramic chip blank. A simple handheld reader will beep if the gaming chip is authentic. Palm Gaming is even manufacturing custom made molds for their ceramic gaming chips- adding yet another high level of security to its gaming chip.\n\nCounterfeit chips are rare. High levels of surveillance, along with staff familiarity with chip design and coloring, make passing fake chips difficult. Casinos, though, are prepared for this situation. All states require that casinos have a set of chips in reserve with alternate markings, though they may not be required to have exactly the same number of reserve chips as they do on the floor. The most notable instance of counterfeiting chips was broken up in 2005, when two men were caught falsely converting $1 chips into higher denominations.\n\nCasino chips used in tournaments are usually much cheaper and of much simpler design. Because the chips have no cash value, usually chips are designed with a single color (usually differing in shade or tone from the version on the casino floor), a smaller breadth, and a basic mark on the interior to distinguish denominations; however, at certain events (such as the World Series of Poker or other televised poker), chips approach quality levels of chips on the floor.\n\nSeveral casinos, such as the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, issue \"limited edition\" varied-designed chips, commemorating various events, though retaining a common color scheme. This encourages customers to keep them for souvenirs, at a profit to the casino.\n\nIn certain casinos, such as the Wynn and Encore Casinos in Las Vegas, chips are embedded with RFID tags to help casinos keep better track of them, determine gamblers' average bet sizes, and to make them harder for counterfeiters to reproduce. However, this technique is costly and considered by many to be unnecessary to profit. Also, this technology provides minimal benefits in games with layouts that do not provide gamblers with their own designated betting areas, such as craps.\n\nThe first game show to use them, \"Duel\", had a variation in which the contestants answer questions using oversized casino tokens. The World Series of Poker at one time actually used its casino tokens for the poker tournaments, but in more recent years has had special Paulson WSOP clay sets made for the tournaments.\n\n"}

{"id": "24527985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24527985", "title": "Commedia dell'arte", "text": "Commedia dell'arte\n\nThe characters of the usually represent fixed social types and stock characters, such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false bravado. The characters are exaggerated \"real characters\", such as a know-it-all doctor called Il Dottore, a greedy old man called Pantalone, or a perfect relationship like the Innamorati.\n\nMany troupes were formed to perform \"commedia dell'arte\", including I Gelosi (which had actors such as Isabella Andreini, and her husband Francesco Andreini), Confidenti Troupe, Desioi Troupe, and Fedeli Troupe. \"Commedia dell'arte\" was often performed outside on platforms or in popular areas such as a piazza. The form of theatre originated in Italy, but travelled throughout Europe and even to Moscow.\n\nThe \"commedia\" genesis may be related to carnival in Venice, where by 1570 the author/actor Andrea Calmo had created the character Il Magnifico, the precursor to the vecchio (old man) Pantalone. In the Flaminio Scala scenario for example, Il Magnifico persists and is interchangeable with Pantalone, into the seventeenth century. While Calmo's characters (which also included the Spanish Capitano and a dottore type) were not masked, it is uncertain at what point the characters donned the mask. However, the connection to carnival (the period between Epiphany and Ash Wednesday) would suggest that masking was a convention of carnival and was applied at some point. The tradition in Northern Italy is centered in Mantua, Florence, and Venice, where the major companies came under the aegis of the various dukes. Concomitantly, a Neapolitan tradition emerged in the south and featured the prominent stage figure Pulcinella. Pulcinella has been long associated with Naples, and derived into various types elsewhere—the most famous as the puppet character Punch (of the eponymous Punch and Judy shows) in England.\n\nAlthough \"commedia dell'arte\" flourished in Italy during the Mannerist period, there has been a long-standing tradition of trying to establish historical antecedents in antiquity. While we can detect formal similarities between the \"commedia dell'arte\" and earlier theatrical traditions, there is no way to establish certainty of origin. Some date the origins to the period of the Roman Republic (Plautine types) or the Empire (Atellan Farces). The Atellan Farces of the Roman Empire featured crude \"types\" wearing masks with grossly exaggerated features and an improvised plot. Some historians argue that Atellan stock characters, Pappus, Maccus+Buccus, and Manducus, are the primitive versions of the Commedia characters Pantalone, Pulcinella, and il Capitano. More recent accounts establish links to the medieval jongleurs, and prototypes from medieval moralities, such as Hellequin (as the source of Harlequin, for example).\n\nThe first recorded \"commedia dell'arte\" performances came from Rome as early as 1551. \"Commedia dell'arte\" was performed outdoors in temporary venues by professional actors who were costumed and masked, as opposed to , which were written comedies, presented indoors by untrained and unmasked actors. This view may be somewhat romanticized since records describe the Gelosi performing Tasso's \"Aminta\", for example, and much was done at court rather than in the street. By the mid-16th century, specific troupes of \"commedia\" performers began to coalesce, and by 1568 the Gelosi became a distinct company. In keeping with the tradition of the Italian Academies, I Gelosi adopted as their impress (or coat of arms) the two-faced Roman god Janus. Janus symbolized both the comings and goings of this traveling troupe, and the dual nature of the actor who impersonates the \"other.\" The Gelosi performed in Northern Italy and France where they received protection and patronage from the King of France. Despite fluctuations the Gelosi maintained stability for performances with the \"usual ten\": \"two \"vecchi\" (old men), four \"innamorati\" (two male and two female lovers), two \"zanni\", a captain and a \"servetta\" (serving maid)\". It should be noted that \"commedia\" often performed inside in court theatres or halls, and also as some fixed theatres such as Teatro Baldrucca in Florence. Flaminio Scala, who had been a minor performer in the Gelosi published the scenarios of the \"commedia dell'arte\" around the start of the 17th century, really in an effort to legitimize the form—and ensure its legacy. These scenari are highly structured and built around the symmetry of the various types in duet: two , , and , etc.\n\nIn \"commedia dell'arte\", female roles were played by women, documented as early as the 1560s. In the 1570s, English theatre critics generally denigrated the troupes with their female actors (some decades later, Ben Jonson referred to one female performer of the \"commedia\" as a \"tumbling whore\"). By the end of the 1570s, Italian prelates attempted to ban female performers; however, by the end of the 16th century, actresses were standard on the Italian stage. The Italian scholar Ferdinando Taviani has collated a number of church documents opposing the advent of the actress as a kind of courtesan, whose scanty attire and promiscuous lifestyle corrupted young men, or at least infused them with carnal desires. Taviani's term \"negativa poetica\" describes this and other practices offensive to the church, while giving us an idea of the phenomenon of the \"commedia dell'arte\" performance.\n\nBy the early 17th century, the \"zanni\" comedies were moving from pure improvisational street performances to specified and clearly delineated acts and characters. Three books written during the 17th century—Cecchini's \"Fruti della moderne commedia\" (1628), Niccolò Barbieri's \"La supplica\" (1634) and Perrucci's \"Dell'arte rapresentativa\" (1699—\"made firm recommendations concerning performing practice.\" Katritzky argues, that as a result, \"commedia\" was reduced to formulaic and stylized acting; as far as possible from the purity of the improvisational genesis a century earlier. In France, during the reign of Louis XIV, the Comédie-Italienne created a repertoire and delineated new masks and characters, while deleting some of the Italian precursors, such as Pantalone. French playwrights, particularly Molière, gleaned from the plots and masks in creating an indigenous treatment. Indeed, Molière shared the stage with the Comédie-Italienne at Petit-Bourbon, and some of his forms, e.g. the tirade, are derivative from the \"commedia\" (\"tirata\").\n\n\"Commedia dell'arte\" moved outside the city limits to the , or fair theatres, in the early 17th century as it evolved toward a more pantomimed style. With the dispatch of the Italian comedians from France in 1697, the form transmogrified in the 18th century as genres such as \"comédie larmoyante\" gained in attraction in France, particularly through the plays of Marivaux. Marivaux softened the \"commedia\" considerably by bringing in true emotion to the stage. Harlequin achieved more prominence during this period.\n\nIt is possible that this kind of improvised acting was passed down the Italian generations until the 17th century, when it was revived as a professional theatrical technique. However, as currently used the term \"commedia dell'arte\" was coined in the mid-18th century.\n\nCuriously, \"commedia dell'arte\" was equally if not more popular in France, where it continued its popularity throughout the 17th century (until 1697), and it was in France that \"commedia\" developed its established repertoire. \"Commedia\" evolved into various configurations across Europe, and each country acculturated the form to its liking. For example, pantomime, which flourished in the 18th century, owes its genesis to the character types of the \"commedia\", particularly Harlequin. The Punch and Judy puppet shows, popular to this day in England, owe their basis to the Pulcinella mask that emerged in Neapolitan versions of the form. In Italy, \"commedia\" masks and plots found their way into the \"opera buffa\", and the plots of Rossini, Verdi, and Puccini.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic occupation of Italy, instigators of reform and critics of French Imperial rule (such as Giacomo Casanova) used the carnival masks to hide their identities while fueling political agendas, challenging social rule and hurling blatant insults and criticisms at the regime. In 1797, in order to destroy the impromptu style of carnival as a partisan platform, Napoleon outlawed the commedia dell'arte. It was not reborn in Venice until 1979.\n\n\"Compagnie\", or companies, were troupes of actors, each of whom had a specific function or role. Actors were versed in a plethora of skills, with many having joined troupes without a theatre background. Some were doctors, other priests, other soldiers, enticed by the excitement and prevalence of theatre in Italian society. Actors were known to switch from troupe to troupe \"on loan,\" and companies would often collaborate if unified by a single patron or performing in the same general location. Members would also splinter off to form their own troupes, such was the case with the Ganassa and the Gelosi. These \"compagnie\" traveled throughout Europe from the early period, beginning with the \"Soldati\", then, the \"Ganassa\", who traveled to Spain, and were famous for playing the guitar and singing—never to be heard from again—and the famous troupes of the Golden Age (1580–1605): \"Gelosi\", \"Confidenti\", \"Accessi\". These names which signified daring and enterprise were appropriated from the names of the academies—in a sense, to lend legitimacy. However, each troupe had its \"impresse\" (like a coat of arms) which symbolized its nature. The Gelosi, for example, used the two-headed face of the Roman god Janus, to signify its comings and goings and relationship to the season of carnival, which took place in January. Janus also signified the duality of the actor, who is playing a character or mask, while still remaining oneself.\n\nMagistrates and clergy were not always receptive to the traveling (companies), particularly during periods of plague, and because of their itinerant nature. Actors, both male and female, were known to strip nearly naked, and storylines typically descended into crude situations with overt sexuality, considered to teach nothing but \"lewdness and adultery...of both sexes\" by the French Parliament. The term was used in reference to the , and remains a derogatory term to this day (vagabond). This was in reference to the nomadic nature of the troupes, often instigated by persecution from the Church, civil authorities, and rival theatre organisations that forced the companies to move from place to place. \n\nA troupe often consisted of ten performers of familiar masked and unmasked types, and included women. The companies would employ carpenters, props masters, servants, nurses, and prompters, all of whom would travel with the company. They would travel in large carts laden with supplies necessary for their nomadic style of performance, enabling them to move from place to place without having to worry about the difficulties of relocation. This nomadic nature, though influenced by persecution, was also largely due in part to the troupes requiring new (and paying) audiences. They would take advantage of public fairs and celebrations, most often in wealthier towns where financial success was more probable. Companies would also find themselves summoned by high-ranking officials, who would offer patronage in return for performing in their land for a certain amount of time. Companies in fact preferred to not stay in any one place too long, mostly out of a fear of the act becoming \"stale.\" They would move on to the next location while their popularity was still active, ensuring the towns and people were sad to see them leave, and would be more likely to either invite them back or pay to watch performances again should the troupe ever return. Prices were dependent on the troupe's decision, which could vary depending on the wealth of the location, the length of stay, and the regulations governments had in place for dramatic performances. \n\n\nGenerally, the actors playing were diverse in background in terms of class and religion, and performed anywhere they could. Castagno posits that the aesthetic of exaggeration, distortion, anti-humanism (as in the masked types), and excessive borrowing as opposed to originality was typical of all the arts in the late Italian Renaissance. Theatre historian Martin Green points to the extravagance of emotion during the period of \"commedia\"s emergence as the reason for representational moods, or characters, that define the art. In commedia each character embodies a mood: mockery, sadness, gaiety, confusion, and so forth.\n\nAccording to 18th-century London theatre critic Baretti, \"commedia dell'arte\" incorporates specific roles and characters that were \"originally intended as a kind of characteristic representative of some particular Italian district or town.\" The character's persona included the specific dialect of the region or town represented. Characters would often be passed down from generation to generation, and characters married onstage were often married in real life as well, seen most famously with Francesco and Isabella Andreini. This was believed to make performances more natural, as well as strengthening the bonds within the troupe, who emphasized complete unity between every member. Additionally, each character has a singular costume and mask that is representative of the character's role.\n\n\"Commedia dell'arte\" has four stock character groups: the servants or \"Zanni\", these are characters such as Arlecchino, Brighella, and Pedrolino; the old men or \"vecchi\", characters such as Pantalone and il Dottore; the lovers or \"innamorati\" who would have names such as Flavio and Isabella; and the captains or \"Capitani\" who can also be La Signora if a female. Male servants and male masters (but not male \"amorosi\") are masked and those characters themselves are often referred to as \"masks\" (in Italian: \"maschere\"), which, according to John Rudlin, cannot be separated from the character. In other words, the characteristics of the character and the characteristics of the mask are the same. In time however, the word \"maschere\" came to refer to all of the characters of the \"commedia dell'arte\" whether masked or not. Female characters (including female servants) are most often not masked (female \"amorose\" are never masked). Female characters in the masters group are rare. Female servants wore bonnets. Their character was played with a malicious wit or gossipy gaiety. The \"amorosi\" are often children of a male character in the masters group, but not of any female character in the masters group, which may represent younger women who have e.g. married an old man, or a high-class courtesan. Female characters in the masters group, while younger than their male counterparts, are nevertheless older than the \"amorosi\". The servants or the clowns are referred to as the \"zanni\" and include characters such as Arlecchino (also known as Harlequin), Brighella, Scapino and Pedrolino. Some of the better known \"commedia dell'arte\" characters are Pierrot and Pierrette, Pantalone, Il Dottore, Brighella, Il Capitano, Colombina, the \"innamorati\", Pedrolino, Pulcinella, Sandrone, Scaramuccia (also known as Scaramouche), La Signora, and Tartaglia.\n\nIn the 17th century as \"commedia\" became popular in France, the characters of Pierrot, Columbine and Harlequin were refined and became essentially Parisian, according to Green.\n\nEach character in Commedia dell'arte has a distinct costume that helps the audience understand who the character is.\n\nArlecchino originally wore a tight fitting long jacket with matching trousers that both had numerous odd shaped patches, usually green, yellow, red, and brown. Usually, there was a bat and a wallet that would hang from his belt. His hat, which was a soft cap, was modeled after Charles IX or after Henri II, and almost always had a tail of a rabbit, hare or a fox with the occasional tuft of feathers. During the 17th century, the patches turned into blue, red, and green triangles arranged in a symmetrical pattern. The 18th century is when the iconic Arlecchino look with the diamond shaped lozenges took shape. The jacket became shorter and his hat changed from a soft cap to a double pointed hat.\n\nIl Dottore's costume was a play on the academic dress of the Bolognese scholars. Il Dottore is almost always clothed entirely in black. He wore a long black gown or jacket that went below the knees. Over the gown, he would have a long black robe that went down to his heels, and he would have on black shoes, stockings, and breeches. In 1653, his costume was changed by Augustin Lolli who was a very popular Il Dottore actor. He added an enormous black hat, changed the robe to a jacket cut similarly to Louis XIV, and added a flat ruff to the neck.\n\nIl Capitano's costume is similar to Il Dottore's in the fact that it is also a satire on military wear of the time. This costume would therefore change depending on where the Capitano character is from, and the period the Capitano is from.\n\nPantalone has one of the most iconic costumes of Commedia dell'arte. Typically, he would wear a tightly fitting jacket with a matching pair of trousers. He usually pairs these two with a big black coat called a zimarra.\n\nWomen, who usually played servants or lovers, wore less stylized costumes than the men in commedia. The lovers, Innamorati, would wear what was considered to be the fashion of the time period. They would only wear plain half-masks with no character distinction or street makeup.\n\nConventional plot lines were written on themes of sex, jealousy, love and old age. Many of the basic plot elements can be traced back to the Roman comedies of Plautus and Terence, some of which were themselves translations of lost Greek comedies of the 4th century BC. However, it is more probable that the \"comici\" used contemporary novella, or, traditional sources as well, and drew from current events and local news of the day. Not all scenari were comic, there were some mixed forms and even tragedies. Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\" is drawn from a popular scenario in the Scala collection, his Polonius (\"Hamlet\") is drawn from Pantalone, and his clowns bear homage to the \"zanni\".\n\n\"Comici\" performed written comedies at court. Song and dance were widely used, and a number of \"innamorati\" were skilled madrigalists, a song form that uses chromatics and close harmonies. Audiences came to see the performers, with plot lines becoming secondary to the performance. Among the great \"innamorate\", Isabella Andreini was perhaps the most widely known, and a medallion dedicated to her reads \"eternal fame\". Tristano Martinelli achieved international fame as the first of the great Arlecchinos, and was honored by the Medici and the Queen of France. Performers made use of well-rehearsed jokes and stock physical gags, known as \"lazzi\" and \"concetti\", as well as on-the-spot improvised and interpolated episodes and routines, called (singular , Italian for joke), usually involving a practical joke.\n\nSince the productions were improvised, dialogue and action could easily be changed to satirize local scandals, current events, or regional tastes, while still using old jokes and punchlines. Characters were identified by costumes, masks, and props, such as a type of baton known as a slapstick. These characters included the forebears of the modern clown, namely Harlequin () and the zanni. Harlequin, in particular, was allowed to comment on current events in his entertainment.\n\nThe classic, traditional plot is that the \"innamorati\" are in love and wish to be married, but one elder (\"vecchio\") or several elders (\"vecchi\") are preventing this from happening, leading the lovers to ask one or more \"zanni\" (eccentric servants) for help. Typically the story ends happily, with the marriage of the \"innamorati\" and forgiveness for any wrongdoings. There are countless variations on this story, as well as many that diverge wholly from the structure, such as a well-known story about Arlecchino becoming mysteriously pregnant, or the Punch and Judy scenario.\n\nWhile generally personally unscripted, the performances often were based on scenarios that gave some semblance of plot to the largely improvised format. The Flaminio Scala scenarios, published in the early 17th century, are the most widely known collection and representative of its most esteemed compagnia, I Gelosi.\n\nThe iconography of the \"commedia dell'arte\" represents an entire field of study that has been examined by \"commedia\" scholars such as Erenstein, Castagno, Katritzky, Molinari, and others. In the early period, representative works by painters at Fontainebleau were notable for their erotic depictions of the thinly veiled \"innamorata\", or the bare-breasted courtesan/actress. The Flemish influence is widely documented as \"commedia\" figures entered the world of the \"vanitas\" genre, depicting the dangers of lust, drinking, and the hedonistic lifestyle. Castagno describes the Flemish \"pittore vago\" (wandering painters) who assimilated themselves within Italian workshops and even assumed Italian surnames: One of the most influential painters, Lodewyk Toeput, for example, became Ludovico Pozzoserrato and was a celebrated painter in the Veneto region of Italy. The \"pittore vago\" can be attributed with establishing \"commedia dell'arte\" as a genre of painting that would persist for centuries.\n\nWhile the iconography gives evidence of the performance style (see Fossard collection), it is important to note that many of the images and engravings were not depictions from real life, but concocted in the studio. The Callot etchings of the Balli di Sfessania (1611) are most widely considered \"capricci\" rather than actual depictions of a \"commedia\" dance form, or typical masks. While these are often reproduced in large formats, it is important to note that the actual prints measured about 2×3 inches. In the 18th century, Watteau's painting of \"commedia\" figures intermingling with the aristocracy were often set in sumptuous garden or pastoral settings and were representative of that genre.\n\nPicasso's painting \"Three Musicians\" painted in 1921 is a colorful representation of \"commedia\"-inspired characters. Picasso also designed the original costumes for Stravinsky's \"Pulcinella\" (1920), a ballet depicting \"commedia\" characters and situations. \"Commedia\" iconography is evident in porcelain figurines many selling for thousands of dollars at auction.\n\nThe expressive theatre influenced Molière's comedy and subsequently \"ballet d'action\", thus lending a fresh range of expression and choreographic means. An example of a \"commedia dell'arte\" character in literature is the Pied Piper of Hamelin who is dressed as Harlequin.\n\nMusic and dance were central to \"commedia dell'arte\" performance. Brighella was often depicted with a guitar, and many images of the \"commedia\" feature singing \"innamorati\" or dancing figures. In fact, it was considered part of the \"innamorati\" function to be able to sing and have the popular repertoire under their belt. Accounts of the early \"commedia\", as far back as Calmo in the 1570s and the buffoni of Venice, note the ability of comici to sing madrigali precisely and beautifully. The danzatrice probably accompanied the troupes, and may have been in addition to the general cast of characters. For examples of strange instruments of various grotesque formations see articles by Tom Heck, who has documented this area.\n\nThe works of a number of playwrights have featured characters influenced by the \"commedia dell'arte\" and sometimes directly drawn from it. Prominent examples include \"The Tempest\" by William Shakespeare, \"Les Fourberies de Scapin\" by Molière, \"Servant of Two Masters\" (1743) by Carlo Goldoni, the \"Figaro\" plays of Pierre Beaumarchais, and especially \"Love for Three Oranges\", \"Turandot\" and other \"fiabe\" by Carlo Gozzi. Influences appear in the lodgers in Steven Berkoff's adaptation of Franz Kafka's \"The Metamorphosis\".\n\nThrough their association with spoken theatre and playwrights \"commedia\" figures have provided opera with many of its stock characters. Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" sets a puppet show story and comic servants like Leporello and Figaro have \"commedia\" precedents. Soubrette characters like Susanna in \"Le nozze di Figaro\", Zerlina in \"Don Giovanni\" and Despina in \"Così fan tutte\" recall Columbina and related characters. The comic operas of Gaetano Donizetti, such as \"Elisir d'amore\", draw readily upon \"commedia\" stock types. Leoncavallo's tragic melodrama \"Pagliacci\" depicts a \"commedia dell'arte\" company in which the performers find their life situations reflecting events they depict on stage. \"Commedia\" characters also figure in Richard Strauss's opera \"Ariadne auf Naxos\".\n\nStock characters and situations also appear in ballet. Igor Stravinsky's \"Petrushka\" and \"Pulcinella\" allude directly to the tradition.\n\n\n\n"}

The last player left is declared the winner and the next round begins. It is usually played by schoolchildren.\n\nDownball walls were built in school yards.\n\nDownball is distinct from Four square, which is played on a marked court on the ground without a wall.\n\nDownball is usually played with a tennis ball. Any number of players can participate. The game area usually consists of a single wall, against which the players hit the ball. The ball must hit the ground once before hitting the wall. A player has the option to let the ball bounce once after hitting the wall or may choose to hit it straight away. The round begins with the champion serving the ball against the wall (one bounce on the ground then off the wall back into play). The other players hit the ball back at the wall in turn. The order of play stays the same throughout the match. \n\nPlayers who fail to hit the ball back against the wall or hit the ball out of bounds go \"out\". When a player is \"out\" that player must vacate the field of play and not interfere with play until the next match (not round). \n\nA match is made up of as many rounds needed to get all but one players out of the game. The survivor becomes the champion and serves during the next match. In the event that the ball is hit by every player to the end of the line of players the game will continue in a loop. In the event the champion goes out, the player second in line becomes the champion for the remainder of the match.\n\nDownball often incorporates the addition of the \"shark shot\". This is played by hitting the ball on the full into another player's body with that player going out of the game. A player who misses a \"Shark shot\" also goes out of the game.\n"}

{"id": "11924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11924", "title": "Game theory", "text": "Game theory\n\nGame theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction between rational decision-makers. It has applications in all fields of social science, as well as in logic and computer science. Originally, it addressed zero-sum games, in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.\n\nModern game theory began with the idea regarding the existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games and its proof by John von Neumann. Von Neumann's original proof used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. His paper was followed by the 1944 book \"Theory of Games and Economic Behavior\", co-written with Oskar Morgenstern, which considered cooperative games of several players. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.\n\nGame theory was developed extensively in the 1950s by many scholars. It was later explicitly applied to biology in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields. , with the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences going to game theorist Jean Tirole, eleven game theorists have won the economics Nobel Prize. John Maynard Smith was awarded the Crafoord Prize for his application of game theory to biology.\n\nEarly discussions of examples of two-person games occurred long before the rise of modern, mathematical game theory. The first known discussion of game theory occurred in a letter written by Charles Waldegrave, an active Jacobite, and uncle to James Waldegrave, a British diplomat, in 1713. In this letter, Waldegrave provides a minimax mixed strategy solution to a two-person version of the card game le Her, and the problem is now known as Waldegrave problem. James Madison made what is now recognized as a game-theoretic analysis of the ways states can be expected to behave under different systems of taxation. In his 1838 \"Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses\" (\"Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth\"), Antoine Augustin Cournot considered a duopoly and presents a solution that is a restricted version of the Nash equilibrium.\n\nIn 1913, Ernst Zermelo published \"Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels\" (\"On an Application of Set Theory to the Theory of the Game of Chess\"). It proved that the optimal chess strategy is strictly determined. This paved the way for more general theorems.\n\nIn 1938, the Danish mathematical economist Frederik Zeuthen proved that the mathematical model had a winning strategy by using Brouwer's fixed point theorem. In his 1938 book \"Applications aux Jeux de Hasard\" and earlier notes, Émile Borel proved a minimax theorem for two-person zero-sum matrix games only when the pay-off matrix was symmetric. Borel conjectured that non-existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games would occur, a conjecture that was proved false.\n\nGame theory did not really exist as a unique field until John von Neumann published the paper \"On the Theory of Games of Strategy\" in 1928. Von Neumann's original proof used Brouwer's fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. His paper was followed by his 1944 book \"Theory of Games and Economic Behavior\" co-authored with Oskar Morgenstern. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of utility, which reincarnated Daniel Bernoulli's old theory of utility (of the money) as an independent discipline. Von Neumann's work in game theory culminated in this 1944 book. This foundational work contains the method for finding mutually consistent solutions for two-person zero-sum games. During the following time period, work on game theory was primarily focused on cooperative game theory, which analyzes optimal strategies for groups of individuals, presuming that they can enforce agreements between them about proper strategies.\n\nIn 1950, the first mathematical discussion of the prisoner's dilemma appeared, and an experiment was undertaken by notable mathematicians Merrill M. Flood and Melvin Dresher, as part of the RAND Corporation's investigations into game theory. RAND pursued the studies because of possible applications to global nuclear strategy. Around this same time, John Nash developed a criterion for mutual consistency of players' strategies, known as Nash equilibrium, applicable to a wider variety of games than the criterion proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern. Nash proved that every n-player, non-zero-sum (not just 2-player zero-sum) non-cooperative game has what is now known as a Nash equilibrium.\n\nGame theory experienced a flurry of activity in the 1950s, during which time the concepts of the core, the extensive form game, fictitious play, repeated games, and the Shapley value were developed. In addition, the first applications of game theory to philosophy and political science occurred during this time.\n\nIn 1979 Robert Axelrod tried setting up computer programs as players and found that in tournaments between them the winner was often a simple \"tit-for-tat\" program that cooperates on the first step, then on subsequent steps just does whatever its opponent did on the previous step. The same winner was also often obtained by natural selection; a fact widely taken to explain cooperation phenomena in evolutionary biology and the social sciences.\n\nIn 1965, Reinhard Selten introduced his solution concept of subgame perfect equilibria, which further refined the Nash equilibrium (later he would introduce trembling hand perfection as well). In 1994 Nash, Selten and Harsanyi became Economics Nobel Laureates for their contributions to economic game theory.\n\nIn the 1970s, game theory was extensively applied in biology, largely as a result of the work of John Maynard Smith and his evolutionarily stable strategy. In addition, the concepts of correlated equilibrium, trembling hand perfection, and common knowledge were introduced and analyzed.\n\nIn 2005, game theorists Thomas Schelling and Robert Aumann followed Nash, Selten and Harsanyi as Nobel Laureates. Schelling worked on dynamic models, early examples of evolutionary game theory. Aumann contributed more to the equilibrium school, introducing an equilibrium coarsening, correlated equilibrium, and developing an extensive formal analysis of the assumption of common knowledge and of its consequences.\n\nIn 2007, Leonid Hurwicz, together with Eric Maskin and Roger Myerson, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics \"for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory\". Myerson's contributions include the notion of proper equilibrium, and an important graduate text: \"Game Theory, Analysis of Conflict\". Hurwicz introduced and formalized the concept of incentive compatibility.\n\nIn 2012, Alvin E. Roth and Lloyd S. Shapley were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics \"for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design\" and, in 2014, the Nobel went to game theorist Jean Tirole.\n\nA game is \"cooperative\" if the players are able to form binding commitments externally enforced (e.g. through contract law). A game is \"non-cooperative\" if players cannot form alliances or if all agreements need to be self-enforcing (e.g. through credible threats).\n\nCooperative games are often analysed through the framework of \"cooperative game theory\", which focuses on predicting which coalitions will form, the joint actions that groups take and the resulting collective payoffs. It is opposed to the traditional \"non-cooperative game theory\" which focuses on predicting individual players' actions and payoffs and analyzing Nash equilibria.\n\nCooperative game theory provides a high-level approach as it only describes the structure, strategies and payoffs of coalitions, whereas non-cooperative game theory also looks at how bargaining procedures will affect the distribution of payoffs within each coalition. As non-cooperative game theory is more general, cooperative games can be analyzed through the approach of non-cooperative game theory (the converse does not hold) provided that sufficient assumptions are made to encompass all the possible strategies available to players due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperation. While it would thus be optimal to have all games expressed under a non-cooperative framework, in many instances insufficient information is available to accurately model the formal procedures available to the players during the strategic bargaining process, or the resulting model would be of too high complexity to offer a practical tool in the real world. In such cases, cooperative game theory provides a simplified approach that allows analysis of the game at large without having to make any assumption about bargaining powers.\n\nA symmetric game is a game where the payoffs for playing a particular strategy depend only on the other strategies employed, not on who is playing them. If the identities of the players can be changed without changing the payoff to the strategies, then a game is symmetric. Many of the commonly studied 2×2 games are symmetric. The standard representations of chicken, the prisoner's dilemma, and the stag hunt are all symmetric games. Some scholars would consider certain asymmetric games as examples of these games as well. However, the most common payoffs for each of these games are symmetric.\n\nMost commonly studied asymmetric games are games where there are not identical strategy sets for both players. For instance, the ultimatum game and similarly the dictator game have different strategies for each player. It is possible, however, for a game to have identical strategies for both players, yet be asymmetric. For example, the game pictured to the right is asymmetric despite having identical strategy sets for both players.\n\nZero-sum games are a special case of constant-sum games, in which choices by players can neither increase nor decrease the available resources. In zero-sum games the total benefit to all players in the game, for every combination of strategies, always adds to zero (more informally, a player benefits only at the equal expense of others). Poker exemplifies a zero-sum game (ignoring the possibility of the house's cut), because one wins exactly the amount one's opponents lose. Other zero-sum games include matching pennies and most classical board games including Go and chess.\n\nMany games studied by game theorists (including the famed prisoner's dilemma) are non-zero-sum games, because the outcome has net results greater or less than zero. Informally, in non-zero-sum games, a gain by one player does not necessarily correspond with a loss by another.\n\nConstant-sum games correspond to activities like theft and gambling, but not to the fundamental economic situation in which there are potential gains from trade. It is possible to transform any game into a (possibly asymmetric) zero-sum game by adding a dummy player (often called \"the board\") whose losses compensate the players' net winnings.\n\nSimultaneous games are games where both players move simultaneously, or if they do not move simultaneously, the later players are unaware of the earlier players' actions (making them \"effectively\" simultaneous). Sequential games (or dynamic games) are games where later players have some knowledge about earlier actions. This need not be perfect information about every action of earlier players; it might be very little knowledge. For instance, a player may know that an earlier player did not perform one particular action, while s/he does not know which of the other available actions the first player actually performed.\n\nThe difference between simultaneous and sequential games is captured in the different representations discussed above. Often, normal form is used to represent simultaneous games, while extensive form is used to represent sequential ones. The transformation of extensive to normal form is one way, meaning that multiple extensive form games correspond to the same normal form. Consequently, notions of equilibrium for simultaneous games are insufficient for reasoning about sequential games; see subgame perfection.\n\nIn short, the differences between sequential and simultaneous games are as follows:\n\nAn important subset of sequential games consists of games of perfect information. A game is one of perfect information if all players know the moves previously made by all other players. Most games studied in game theory are imperfect-information games. Examples of perfect-information games include tic-tac-toe, checkers, infinite chess, and Go.\n\nMany card games are games of imperfect information, such as poker and bridge. Perfect information is often confused with complete information, which is a similar concept. Complete information requires that every player know the strategies and payoffs available to the other players but not necessarily the actions taken. Games of incomplete information can be reduced, however, to games of imperfect information by introducing \"moves by nature\".\n\nGames in which the difficulty of finding an optimal strategy stems from the multiplicity of possible moves are called combinatorial games. Examples include chess and go. Games that involve imperfect information may also have a strong combinatorial character, for instance backgammon. There is no unified theory addressing combinatorial elements in games. There are, however, mathematical tools that can solve particular problems and answer general questions.\n\nGames of perfect information have been studied in combinatorial game theory, which has developed novel representations, e.g. surreal numbers, as well as combinatorial and algebraic (and sometimes non-constructive) proof methods to solve games of certain types, including \"loopy\" games that may result in infinitely long sequences of moves. These methods address games with higher combinatorial complexity than those usually considered in traditional (or \"economic\") game theory. A typical game that has been solved this way is hex. A related field of study, drawing from computational complexity theory, is game complexity, which is concerned with estimating the computational difficulty of finding optimal strategies.\n\nResearch in artificial intelligence has addressed both perfect and imperfect information games that have very complex combinatorial structures (like chess, go, or backgammon) for which no provable optimal strategies have been found. The practical solutions involve computational heuristics, like alpha-beta pruning or use of artificial neural networks trained by reinforcement learning, which make games more tractable in computing practice.\n\nGames, as studied by economists and real-world game players, are generally finished in finitely many moves. Pure mathematicians are not so constrained, and set theorists in particular study games that last for infinitely many moves, with the winner (or other payoff) not known until \"after\" all those moves are completed.\n\nThe focus of attention is usually not so much on the best way to play such a game, but whether one player has a winning strategy. (It can be proven, using the axiom of choice, that there are gameseven with perfect information and where the only outcomes are \"win\" or \"lose\"for which \"neither\" player has a winning strategy.) The existence of such strategies, for cleverly designed games, has important consequences in descriptive set theory.\n\nMuch of game theory is concerned with finite, discrete games, that have a finite number of players, moves, events, outcomes, etc. Many concepts can be extended, however. Continuous games allow players to choose a strategy from a continuous strategy set. For instance, Cournot competition is typically modeled with players' strategies being any non-negative quantities, including fractional quantities.\n\nDifferential games such as the continuous pursuit and evasion game are continuous games where the evolution of the players' state variables is governed by differential equations. The problem of finding an optimal strategy in a differential game is closely related to the optimal control theory. In particular, there are two types of strategies: the open-loop strategies are found using the Pontryagin maximum principle while the closed-loop strategies are found using Bellman's Dynamic Programming method.\n\nA particular case of differential games are the games with a random time horizon. In such games, the terminal time is a random variable with a given probability distribution function. Therefore, the players maximize the mathematical expectation of the cost function. It was shown that the modified optimization problem can be reformulated as a discounted differential game over an infinite time interval.\n\nEvolutionary game theory studies players who adjust their strategies over time according to rules that are not necessarily rational or farsighted. In general, the evolution of strategies over time according to such rules is modeled as a Markov chain with a state variable such as the current strategy profile or how the game has been played in the recent past. Such rules may feature imitation, optimization or survival of the fittest.\n\nIn biology, such models can represent (biological) evolution, in which offspring adopt their parents' strategies and parents who play more successful strategies (i.e. corresponding to higher payoffs) have a greater number of offspring. In the social sciences, such models typically represent strategic adjustment by players who play a game many times within their lifetime and, consciously or unconsciously, occasionally adjust their strategies.\n\nIndividual decision problems with stochastic outcomes are sometimes considered \"one-player games\". These situations are not considered game theoretical by some authors. They may be modeled using similar tools within the related disciplines of decision theory, operations research, and areas of artificial intelligence, particularly AI planning (with uncertainty) and multi-agent system. Although these fields may have different motivators, the mathematics involved are substantially the same, e.g. using Markov decision processes (MDP).\n\nStochastic outcomes can also be modeled in terms of game theory by adding a randomly acting player who makes \"chance moves\" (\"moves by nature\"). This player is not typically considered a third player in what is otherwise a two-player game, but merely serves to provide a roll of the dice where required by the game.\n\nFor some problems, different approaches to modeling stochastic outcomes may lead to different solutions. For example, the difference in approach between MDPs and the minimax solution is that the latter considers the worst-case over a set of adversarial moves, rather than reasoning in expectation about these moves given a fixed probability distribution. The minimax approach may be advantageous where stochastic models of uncertainty are not available, but may also be overestimating extremely unlikely (but costly) events, dramatically swaying the strategy in such scenarios if it is assumed that an adversary can force such an event to happen. (See Black swan theory for more discussion on this kind of modeling issue, particularly as it relates to predicting and limiting losses in investment banking.)\n\nGeneral models that include all elements of stochastic outcomes, adversaries, and partial or noisy observability (of moves by other players) have also been studied. The \"gold standard\" is considered to be partially observable stochastic game (POSG), but few realistic problems are computationally feasible in POSG representation.\n\nThese are games the play of which is the development of the rules for another game, the target or subject game. Metagames seek to maximize the utility value of the rule set developed. The theory of metagames is related to mechanism design theory.\n\nThe term metagame analysis is also used to refer to a practical approach developed by Nigel Howard. whereby a situation is framed as a strategic game in which stakeholders try to realise their objectives by means of the options available to them. Subsequent developments have led to the formulation of confrontation analysis.\n\nThese are games prevailing over all forms of society. Pooling games are repeated plays with changing payoff table in general over an experienced path and their equilibrium strategies usually take a form of evolutionary social convention and economic convention. Pooling game theory emerges to formally recognize the interaction between optimal choice in one play and the emergence of forthcoming payoff table update path, identify the invariance existence and robustness, and predict variance over time. The theory is based upon topological transformation classification of payoff table update over time to predict variance and invariance, and is also within the jurisdiction of the computational law of reachable optimality for ordered system.\n\nMean field game theory is the study of strategic decision making in very large populations of small interacting agents. This class of problems was considered in the economics literature by Boyan Jovanovic and Robert W. Rosenthal, in the engineering literature by Peter E. Caines and by mathematician Pierre-Louis Lions and Jean-Michel Lasry.\n\nThe games studied in game theory are well-defined mathematical objects. To be fully defined, a game must specify the following elements: the \"players\" of the game, the \"information\" and \"actions\" available to each player at each decision point, and the \"payoffs\" for each outcome. (Eric Rasmusen refers to these four \"essential elements\" by the acronym \"PAPI\".) A game theorist typically uses these elements, along with a solution concept of their choosing, to deduce a set of equilibrium strategies for each player such that, when these strategies are employed, no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy. These equilibrium strategies determine an equilibrium to the game—a stable state in which either one outcome occurs or a set of outcomes occur with known probability.\n\nMost cooperative games are presented in the characteristic function form, while the extensive and the normal forms are used to define noncooperative games.\n\nThe extensive form can be used to formalize games with a time sequencing of moves. Games here are played on trees (as pictured here). Here each vertex (or node) represents a point of choice for a player. The player is specified by a number listed by the vertex. The lines out of the vertex represent a possible action for that player. The payoffs are specified at the bottom of the tree. The extensive form can be viewed as a multi-player generalization of a decision tree. To solve any extensive form game, backward induction must be used. It involves working backward up the game tree to determine what a rational player would do at the last vertex of the tree, what the player with the previous move would do given that the player with the last move is rational, and so on until the first vertex of the tree is reached.\n\nThe game pictured consists of two players. The way this particular game is structured (i.e., with sequential decision making and perfect information), \"Player 1\" \"moves\" first by choosing either \"F\" or \"U\" (Fair or Unfair). Next in the sequence, \"Player 2\", who has now seen \"Player 1\"s move, chooses to play either \"A\" or \"R\". Once \"Player 2\" has made his/ her choice, the game is considered finished and each player gets their respective payoff. Suppose that \"Player 1\" chooses \"U\" and then \"Player 2\" chooses \"A\": \"Player 1\" then gets a payoff of \"eight\" (which in real-world terms can be interpreted in many ways, the simplest of which is in terms of money but could mean things such as eight days of vacation or eight countries conquered or even eight more opportunities to play the same game against other players) and \"Player 2\" gets a payoff of \"two\".\n\nThe extensive form can also capture simultaneous-move games and games with imperfect information. To represent it, either a dotted line connects different vertices to represent them as being part of the same information set (i.e. the players do not know at which point they are), or a closed line is drawn around them. (See example in the imperfect information section.)\n\nThe normal (or strategic form) game is usually represented by a matrix which shows the players, strategies, and payoffs (see the example to the right). More generally it can be represented by any function that associates a payoff for each player with every possible combination of actions. In the accompanying example there are two players; one chooses the row and the other chooses the column. Each player has two strategies, which are specified by the number of rows and the number of columns. The payoffs are provided in the interior. The first number is the payoff received by the row player (Player 1 in our example); the second is the payoff for the column player (Player 2 in our example). Suppose that Player 1 plays \"Up\" and that Player 2 plays \"Left\". Then Player 1 gets a payoff of 4, and Player 2 gets 3.\n\nWhen a game is presented in normal form, it is presumed that each player acts simultaneously or, at least, without knowing the actions of the other. If players have some information about the choices of other players, the game is usually presented in extensive form.\n\nEvery extensive-form game has an equivalent normal-form game, however the transformation to normal form may result in an exponential blowup in the size of the representation, making it computationally impractical.\n\nIn games that possess removable utility, separate rewards are not given; rather, the characteristic function decides the payoff of each unity. The idea is that the unity that is 'empty', so to speak, does not receive a reward at all.\n\nThe origin of this form is to be found in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's book; when looking at these instances, they guessed that when a union formula_1 appears, it works against the fraction\nformula_2\nas if two individuals were playing a normal game. The balanced payoff of C is a basic function. Although there are differing examples that help determine coalitional amounts from normal games, not all appear that in their function form can be derived from such.\n\nFormally, a characteristic function is seen as: (N,v), where N represents the group of people and formula_3 is a normal utility.\n\nSuch characteristic functions have expanded to describe games where there is no removable utility.\n\nAs a method of applied mathematics, game theory has been used to study a wide variety of human and animal behaviors. It was initially developed in economics to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including behaviors of firms, markets, and consumers. The first use of game-theoretic analysis was by Antoine Augustin Cournot in 1838 with his solution of the Cournot duopoly. The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded, and game theory has been applied to political, sociological, and psychological behaviors as well.\n\nAlthough pre-twentieth century naturalists such as Charles Darwin made game-theoretic kinds of statements, the use of game-theoretic analysis in biology began with Ronald Fisher's studies of animal behavior during the 1930s. This work predates the name \"game theory\", but it shares many important features with this field. The developments in economics were later applied to biology largely by John Maynard Smith in his book \"Evolution and the Theory of Games\".\n\nIn addition to being used to describe, predict, and explain behavior, game theory has also been used to develop theories of ethical or normative behavior and to prescribe such behavior. In economics and philosophy, scholars have applied game theory to help in the understanding of good or proper behavior. Game-theoretic arguments of this type can be found as far back as Plato.\n\nThe primary use of game theory is to describe and model how human populations behave. Some scholars believe that by finding the equilibria of games they can predict how actual human populations will behave when confronted with situations analogous to the game being studied. This particular view of game theory has been criticized. It is argued that the assumptions made by game theorists are often violated when applied to real-world situations. Game theorists usually assume players act rationally, but in practice, human behavior often deviates from this model. Game theorists respond by comparing their assumptions to those used in physics. Thus while their assumptions do not always hold, they can treat game theory as a reasonable scientific ideal akin to the models used by physicists. However, empirical work has shown that in some classic games, such as the centipede game, guess 2/3 of the average game, and the dictator game, people regularly do not play Nash equilibria. There is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of these experiments and whether the analysis of the experiments fully captures all aspects of the relevant situation.\n\nSome game theorists, following the work of John Maynard Smith and George R. Price, have turned to evolutionary game theory in order to resolve these issues. These models presume either no rationality or bounded rationality on the part of players. Despite the name, evolutionary game theory does not necessarily presume natural selection in the biological sense. Evolutionary game theory includes both biological as well as cultural evolution and also models of individual learning (for example, fictitious play dynamics).\n\nSome scholars, like Leonard Savage, see game theory not as a predictive tool for the behavior of human beings, but as a suggestion for how people ought to behave. Since a strategy, corresponding to a Nash equilibrium of a game constitutes one's best response to the actions of the other players – provided they are in (the same) Nash equilibrium – playing a strategy that is part of a Nash equilibrium seems appropriate. This normative use of game theory has also come under criticism.\n\nGame theory is a major method used in mathematical economics and business for modeling competing behaviors of interacting agents. Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as auctions, bargaining, mergers & acquisitions pricing, fair division, duopolies, oligopolies, social network formation, agent-based computational economics, general equilibrium, mechanism design, and voting systems; and across such broad areas as experimental economics, behavioral economics, information economics, industrial organization, and political economy.\n\nThis research usually focuses on particular sets of strategies known as \"solution concepts\" or \"equilibria\". A common assumption is that players act rationally. In non-cooperative games, the most famous of these is the Nash equilibrium. A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies. If all the players are playing the strategies in a Nash equilibrium, they have no unilateral incentive to deviate, since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are doing.\n\nThe payoffs of the game are generally taken to represent the utility of individual players.\n\nA prototypical paper on game theory in economics begins by presenting a game that is an abstraction of a particular economic situation. One or more solution concepts are chosen, and the author demonstrates which strategy sets in the presented game are equilibria of the appropriate type. Naturally one might wonder to what use this information should be put. Economists and business professors suggest two primary uses (noted above): \"descriptive\" and \"prescriptive\".\n\nThe application of game theory to political science is focused in the overlapping areas of fair division, political economy, public choice, war bargaining, positive political theory, and social choice theory. In each of these areas, researchers have developed game-theoretic models in which the players are often voters, states, special interest groups, and politicians.\n\nEarly examples of game theory applied to political science are provided by Anthony Downs. In his book \"An Economic Theory of Democracy\", he applies the Hotelling firm location model to the political process. In the Downsian model, political candidates commit to ideologies on a one-dimensional policy space. Downs first shows how the political candidates will converge to the ideology preferred by the median voter if voters are fully informed, but then argues that voters choose to remain rationally ignorant which allows for candidate divergence. Game Theory was applied in 1962 to the Cuban missile crisis during the presidency of John F. Kennedy.\n\nIt has also been proposed that game theory explains the stability of any form of political government. Taking the simplest case of a monarchy, for example, the king, being only one person, does not and cannot maintain his authority by personally exercising physical control over all or even any significant number of his subjects. Sovereign control is instead explained by the recognition by each citizen that all other citizens expect each other to view the king (or other established government) as the person whose orders will be followed. Coordinating communication among citizens to replace the sovereign is effectively barred, since conspiracy to replace the sovereign is generally punishable as a crime. Thus, in a process that can be modeled by variants of the prisoner's dilemma, during periods of stability no citizen will find it rational to move to replace the sovereign, even if all the citizens know they would be better off if they were all to act collectively.\n\nA game-theoretic explanation for democratic peace is that public and open debate in democracies sends clear and reliable information regarding their intentions to other states. In contrast, it is difficult to know the intentions of nondemocratic leaders, what effect concessions will have, and if promises will be kept. Thus there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is a non-democracy.\n\nOn the other hand, game theory predicts that two countries may still go to war even if their leaders are cognizant of the costs of fighting. War may result from asymmetric information; two countries may have incentives to mis-represent the amount of military resources they have on hand, rendering them unable to settle disputes agreeably without resorting to fighting. Moreover, war may arise because of commitment problems: if two countries wish to settle a dispute via peaceful means, but each wishes to go back on the terms of that settlement, they may have no choice but to resort to warfare. Finally, war may result from issue indivisibilities.\n\nGame theory could also help predict a nation's responses when there is a new rule or law to be applied to that nation. One example would be Peter John Wood's (2013) research when he looked into what nations could do to help reduce climate change. Wood thought this could be accomplished by making treaties with other nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, he concluded that this idea could not work because it would create a prisoner's dilemma to the nations.\n\nUnlike those in economics, the payoffs for games in biology are often interpreted as corresponding to fitness. In addition, the focus has been less on equilibria that correspond to a notion of rationality and more on ones that would be maintained by evolutionary forces. The best-known equilibrium in biology is known as the \"evolutionarily stable strategy\" (ESS), first introduced in . Although its initial motivation did not involve any of the mental requirements of the Nash equilibrium, every ESS is a Nash equilibrium.\n\nIn biology, game theory has been used as a model to understand many different phenomena. It was first used to explain the evolution (and stability) of the approximate 1:1 sex ratios. suggested that the 1:1 sex ratios are a result of evolutionary forces acting on individuals who could be seen as trying to maximize their number of grandchildren.\n\nAdditionally, biologists have used evolutionary game theory and the ESS to explain the emergence of animal communication. The analysis of signaling games and other communication games has provided insight into the evolution of communication among animals. For example, the mobbing behavior of many species, in which a large number of prey animals attack a larger predator, seems to be an example of spontaneous emergent organization. Ants have also been shown to exhibit feed-forward behavior akin to fashion (see Paul Ormerod's \"Butterfly Economics\").\n\nBiologists have used the game of chicken to analyze fighting behavior and territoriality.\n\nAccording to Maynard Smith, in the preface to \"Evolution and the Theory of Games\", \"paradoxically, it has turned out that game theory is more readily applied to biology than to the field of economic behaviour for which it was originally designed\". Evolutionary game theory has been used to explain many seemingly incongruous phenomena in nature.\n\nOne such phenomenon is known as biological altruism. This is a situation in which an organism appears to act in a way that benefits other organisms and is detrimental to itself. This is distinct from traditional notions of altruism because such actions are not conscious, but appear to be evolutionary adaptations to increase overall fitness. Examples can be found in species ranging from vampire bats that regurgitate blood they have obtained from a night's hunting and give it to group members who have failed to feed, to worker bees that care for the queen bee for their entire lives and never mate, to vervet monkeys that warn group members of a predator's approach, even when it endangers that individual's chance of survival. All of these actions increase the overall fitness of a group, but occur at a cost to the individual.\n\nEvolutionary game theory explains this altruism with the idea of kin selection. Altruists discriminate between the individuals they help and favor relatives. Hamilton's rule explains the evolutionary rationale behind this selection with the equation , where the cost to the altruist must be less than the benefit to the recipient multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness . The more closely related two organisms are causes the incidences of altruism to increase because they share many of the same alleles. This means that the altruistic individual, by ensuring that the alleles of its close relative are passed on through survival of its offspring, can forgo the option of having offspring itself because the same number of alleles are passed on. For example, helping a sibling (in diploid animals) has a coefficient of ½, because (on average) an individual shares ½ of the alleles in its sibling's offspring. Ensuring that enough of a sibling's offspring survive to adulthood precludes the necessity of the altruistic individual producing offspring. The coefficient values depend heavily on the scope of the playing field; for example if the choice of whom to favor includes all genetic living things, not just all relatives, we assume the discrepancy between all humans only accounts for approximately 1% of the diversity in the playing field, a coefficient that was ½ in the smaller field becomes 0.995. Similarly if it is considered that information other than that of a genetic nature (e.g. epigenetics, religion, science, etc.) persisted through time the playing field becomes larger still, and the discrepancies smaller.\n\nGame theory has come to play an increasingly important role in logic and in computer science. Several logical theories have a basis in game semantics. In addition, computer scientists have used games to model interactive computations. Also, game theory provides a theoretical basis to the field of multi-agent systems.\n\nSeparately, game theory has played a role in online algorithms; in particular, the k-server problem, which has in the past been referred to as \"games with moving costs\" and \"request-answer games\". Yao's principle is a game-theoretic technique for proving lower bounds on the computational complexity of randomized algorithms, especially online algorithms.\n\nThe emergence of the internet has motivated the development of algorithms for finding equilibria in games, markets, computational auctions, peer-to-peer systems, and security and information markets. Algorithmic game theory and within it algorithmic mechanism design combine computational algorithm design and analysis of complex systems with economic theory.\n\nGame theory has been put to several uses in philosophy. Responding to two papers by , used game theory to develop a philosophical account of convention. In so doing, he provided the first analysis of common knowledge and employed it in analyzing play in coordination games. In addition, he first suggested that one can understand meaning in terms of signaling games. This later suggestion has been pursued by several philosophers since Lewis. Following game-theoretic account of conventions, Edna Ullmann-Margalit (1977) and Bicchieri (2006) have developed theories of social norms that define them as Nash equilibria that result from transforming a mixed-motive game into a coordination game.\n\nGame theory has also challenged philosophers to think in terms of interactive epistemology: what it means for a collective to have common beliefs or knowledge, and what are the consequences of this knowledge for the social outcomes resulting from the interactions of agents. Philosophers who have worked in this area include Bicchieri (1989, 1993), Skyrms (1990), and Stalnaker (1999).\n\nIn ethics, some (most notably David Gauthier, Gregory Kavka, and Jean Hampton) authors have attempted to pursue Thomas Hobbes' project of deriving morality from self-interest. Since games like the prisoner's dilemma present an apparent conflict between morality and self-interest, explaining why cooperation is required by self-interest is an important component of this project. This general strategy is a component of the general social contract view in political philosophy (for examples, see and ).\n\nOther authors have attempted to use evolutionary game theory in order to explain the emergence of human attitudes about morality and corresponding animal behaviors. These authors look at several games including the prisoner's dilemma, stag hunt, and the Nash bargaining game as providing an explanation for the emergence of attitudes about morality (see, e.g., and ).\n\n\nLists\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37757038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37757038", "title": "History of homosexuality in American film", "text": "History of homosexuality in American film\n\nSince the transition into the modern-day gay rights movement, homosexuality has appeared more frequently in American film and cinema. Compared to the 1900s, it is clear that the greater acceptance of homosexuality in the modern era has allowed more queer characters and issues to be seen with more respect and understanding in film and cinema.\n\nThe first notable form of homosexuality depicted in film was in 1895 between two men dancing together in the William Kennedy Dickson motion picture \"The Dickson Experimental Sound Film\", commonly labeled online and in three published books as \"The Gay Brothers\". Though, at the time, men were not seen this way as queer or even flamboyant, but merely acting fanciful. Film critic Parker Tyler stated that the scene \"shocked audiences with its subversion of conventional male behavior\". During the late nineteenth century and into the 1920s–30s, homosexuality was largely depicted in gender-based conventions and stereotypes. Oftentimes male characters intended to be identified as gay were flamboyant, effeminate, humorous characters in film. The terms \"pansy\" and \"sissy\" became tagged to homosexuality and was described as \"a flowery, fussy, effeminate soul given to limp wrists and mincing steps\". Because of his high-pitched voice and attitude, the pansy easily transitioned from the silent film era into the talking pictures where those characteristics could be taken advantage of. Male characters were depicted as having effeminate jobs in the work force, creating the stereotype that homosexuals were associated with these careers, which include tailor, hairdresser, choreographers, and many more. It was also during this time that characters in prison were being portrayed at homosexual. While queer male characters became associated as Pansies and sissies, queer female characters were not given a title rather, they were associated with cross dressing, having a deep voice, confusing and emasculating men, and as having a “man’s job.” \n\nDuring the period of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the cinema audience had decreased significantly. Filmmakers produced movies with themes and images that had high shock-value to get people returning to the theaters. This called for the inclusion of more controversial topics such as prostitution and violence, creating a demand for pansies and their lesbian counterparts to stimulate or shock the audience. With the new influx of these provocative subjects, debates arose regarding the negative effects these films could have on American society.\n\nIt was during this same time that the United States Supreme Court ruled that films did not have First Amendment protection, due to the film industry being a business that could be easily used for “evil”, and several local governments passed laws restricting the public exhibition of \"indecent\" or \"immoral\" films. The media publicity surrounding several high-profile celebrity scandals and the danger of church-led boycotts also pressured the leadership within the film industry to establish a national censorship board, which became the Motion Picture Production Code.\n\nThe Motion Picture Production Code, also simply known as the Production Code or as the \"Hays Code\", was established both to curtail additional government censorship and to prevent the loss of revenue from boycotts led by the Catholic Church and fundamentalist Protestant groups, whom had wanted to judge the moral impact of cinematic Hollywood on the general public. In terms of homosexuality, the code marked the end of the \"pansy\" characters and the beginning of depictions that were more reserved and buried within subtext. While the code did not explicitly state homosexuality as against the code, the code stated no kind of sex perversion, which homosexuality fell under at the time, labeling them as sexual deviants. Despite the code stating that homosexuality was sex perversion, homosexuals came to also be represented as villains or victims, that commit crimes due to their homosexuality. Per the production code these homosexual villains would have to be punished by the law in order to coincide with the production code’s rule stating that films not place crime about law. An example for the enforcement of the production code is the character Joel Cairo in the movie Maltese Falcon. in the original novel the character is clearly homosexual, however in the movie it is vague. The production code not only effected what was cut from movies containing homosexual character, but removed them completely. The stage play, The Children’s Hour by Lillian Hellman was released as a film in 1936 called These Three. The stage play contained two teachers being accused of having a lesbian affair, yet the film created a heterosexual love triangle between two women and one man. Critics came to favor the Production code as it allowed for unsavory behaviors to be eliminated from the public’s eye, one example included stage play The Children’s Hour and the film These Three. Critics stated that the film was more enjoyable with the absence of the lesbian characters when compared to the original stage play.\n\nThe time period prior to the \"Hays Code\" also included many gender role-reversal productions, notably Charlie Chaplin's \"A Woman\" (1915), in which Chaplin dresses as a female and plays with the affection of various men. Famous series of drag impersonations included \"Miss Fatty\" (1915), featuring Fatty Arbuckle, and \"Sweedie\" (1914–16), starring Academy Award-winning actor Wallace Beery, created a comedic view of drag that many in the late 1910s and early 1920s could find entertaining. These depictions became rarer for mainstream commercial films with the establishment of the Hollywood Production Code.\nVarious other notable drag films of the early to mid-1900s include: \n\nFrom 1950-56 Jerry Lewis appeared in several film remakes in roles originally written for women. He appeared in drag in the films At War With The Army, Scared Stiff, and Money From Home and routinely adopted “sissy” mannerisms and gender ambiguous role-playing with his partner Dean Martin. He was criticized by the press for his ‘prancing and mincing’ homosexual references.\n\nDuring the Second World War and the subsequent Cold War, Hollywood increasingly depicted gay men and women as sadists, psychopaths, and nefarious, anti-social villains. These depictions were driven by the censorship of the code, which was willing to allow \"sexual perversion\" if it was depicted in a negative manner, as well as the fact that homosexuality was classified as a mental illness and gay men and women were often harassed by the police. This can be examined in Alfred Hitchcock's 1948 film \"Rope\". In his article \"The History of Gays and Lesbians on Film\", author Daniel Mangin explains:\n\nThe censorship code gradually became liberalized 1950s–60s, until it was replaced by the current classification system established by the Motion Picture Association of America. Legally, it was in the mid-1950s when the United States Supreme Court extended First Amendment legal protection to films, reversing its original verdict, and, in a second case, ended once common practice of film studios owning the cinemas. That practice had made it difficult for films produced outside of these studios, such as independent or international films, to be screened widely, let alone to be commercially successful.\n\nCulturally, American consumers were increasingly less likely to boycott a film at the request of the Catholic Church or fundamentalist Protestant groups. This meant that films with objectionable content did not necessarily need the approval of the Hollywood Production Code or religious groups in order to be successful. As a result, Hollywood gradually became more willing to ignore the code in order to compete with television and the growing access to independent and international cinema.\n\nDuring the 1950s–60s, gay characters in American films were identified with more overtly sexual innuendos and methods (e.g., reference in The Seven Year Itch to three male tenants who are \"interior decorators or something\"), but having a gay or bisexual sexual orientation was largely treated as a trait of miserable and suicidal misfits who frequently killed themselves or other people.\n\nDuring this post-war era, mainstream American cinema might advocate tolerance for eccentric, sensitive young men, wrongly, accused of homosexuality, such as in the film adaptation of \"Tea and Sympathy\" (1956), but gay characters were frequently eliminated from the final cut of the film or depicted as dangerous misfits who would fall prey to a well-deserved violent end.\n\nThe film \"Lawrence of Arabia\", widely seen as one of the best films ever created, was revolutionary for several reasons including depicting not only a character who is heavily implied to be gay, but also implying a relationship between two men. Though T.E. Lawrence's sexuality remains ambiguous, director David Lean had Peter O'Toole play his version of the desert hero as a gay man. Beyond this, Lean also implied a relationship between Lawrence and his companion Sherif Ali, played by Omar Sharif. Years later, when asked about the homosexuality in his hit film, Lean commented, \"Throughout, Lawrence was very, if not entirely, homosexual. We thought we were being very daring at the time: Lawrence and Omar...\" This is one of the first examples of an LGBT+ film being a box office success without an incredible amount of innuendo to disguise the homosexual nature of the film.\n\nThe 1965 film \"Inside Daisy Clover\", based on the novel of the same name, was one of the first mainstream American films during the 1950s–60s to depict an expressly gay or bisexual character who, while forced to marry a woman for his career, is not uncomfortable with his sexual orientation and does commit suicide or fall victim to murder. Yet, beyond a few lines of dialogue, the character's bisexuality was largely restricted to bits of subtext and innuendo.\n\nIn America, efforts at creating complex gay or bisexual film characters were largely restricted to people such as Andy Warhol and Kenneth Anger. Beyond their underground, independent films, a handful of foreign films were depicting gay characters as complex human beings entitled to tolerance, if not equality. However, mainstream American cinema efforts at marketing films for a LGBT audience did not begin until the 1970s.\n\nFollowing the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City (a major turning point in the LGBT-rights movement), Hollywood began to look at gay people as a possible consumer demographic. It was also in the 1970s, that some anti-gay laws and prejudicial attitudes changed through the work of an increasingly visible LGBT-rights movement and overall attitudes in America about human sexuality, sex and gender roles changed as a result of LGBT-rights, women's liberation and the sexual revolution.\n\n\"The Boys in the Band\" (1970) was the first attempt of Hollywood to market a film to gay consumers and present an honest look at what it meant to be a gay or bisexual man in America. The film based on a play of the same name, was often hailed in the mainstream press as a presenting a \"landmark of truths\", but was often criticized for reinforcing certain anti-gay stereotypes and for failing to deal with LGBT-rights and showing a group of gay and bisexual men who are all unhappy, miserable and bitchy.\n\nIn contrast, \"Fortune and Men's Eyes\" (1971), was co-produced by MGM, dealt with the issue of homosexuality in prison, and depicted gays in a relatively \"open and realistic, non-stereotypical and non-caricatured manner\".\n\nDespite the criticism and setbacks with the Boys in the Band film, the treatment of homosexuality in mainstream American film did, gradually, improve during the 1970s, especially if the film was directed at a gay audience (i.e. \"A Very Natural Thing\" (1973)), or a more cosmopolitan-liberal audience (i.e. \"Something for Everyone\" (1970), \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" (1971), \"Cabaret\" (1972) and \"Ode to Billy Joe\" (1976)).\n\nDespite the growing tolerance of homosexuality during the 1970s, some Hollywood films throughout the decade still depicted homosexuality as an insult or a joke. Gay characters were sometimes depicted in mainstream films as dangerous misfits who needed to be cured or killed. Some films would even use anti-gay derogatory comments, often made by the protagonist, in a manner that was not done in Hollywood films with regards to other minority groups. Films like \"Cruising\" (1980) and \"Windows\", for example, portrayed gays in an unrelentingly negative light.\n\nThe slowly growing acceptance of homosexuality in film continued into the early 1980s, with the addition of two new factors; the rising political clout of Christian fundamentalist groups, committed to a conservative, traditionalist social and economic agenda, and the emergence of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, an organized religious-political movement arose in America to oppose LGBT rights. The political clout of the \"religious right\", as it became known, grew as its role in helping to elect, mostly, Republican Party candidates and move the party further to the political right.\n\nAs a result, a Hollywood film in the mid-1980s that depicted gay people as being complex human beings entitled to their rights and dignity was a potential commercial liability and was at risk of a boycott from the stronghold conservative, right wing movement. Throughout the 1980s, if a Hollywood film was not made, primarily, for a gay audience or a cosmopolitan–liberal audience, homosexuality was often depicted as something to laugh at, pity or fear.\n\nAlong with clout of fundamentalist Christian groups, the Hollywood's treatment of homosexuality and gay characters was also shaped by the emergence of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Ignorance about the disease, and how it was spread, was commonplace and the fact that many of the early American victims were gay or bisexual men helped to fuel the myth that gave the disease its first name; GRID (Gay Related Immune Disorder).\n\nAs mainstream American films began to depict or make reference to the pandemic, the ignorance about the disease, including the idea that if one is gay, then they must have AIDS, spread. The first American film about the pandemic, and the ignorance and homophobia that it promoted, was an independent film, \"Parting Glances\" (1986). It was followed by a mainstream television movie, \"An Early Frost\" (1985), but the first mainstream Hollywood film about the pandemic, and its impact on the gay community, would be released at the end of the decade; \"Longtime Companion\" (1989), followed up by \"Philadelphia\" (1993) a few years later.\n\nAll of these initial films and television movies about the pandemic followed a similar demographic pattern in that person living with AIDS was a white man from a middle-class or upper-class family, who was usually somber and emotional. Though, homosexual characters and the disease were often shown in a negative light, they were also shown together as something manageable and \"okay\".\n\nIn the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the cultural and political backlash that had occurred against gay people and gay rights issues began to decline, impacting how Hollywood treated LGBT-issues. The clout of Christian fundamentalist had its limits; in 1988, Pat Robertson, a prominent Christian fundamentalist, ran for president in the Republican Party primary and was soundly defeated. During the decade, more LGBT people had come out, including celebrities and politicians and the AIDS-HIV pandemic had forced the broader society to more openly talk about human sexuality, including homosexuality.\n\nA younger, \"queerer\" generation of gay people were not only coming out at younger ages, but becoming involved in helping to build what became known, in the early – mid-1990s, as \"Queer Cinema\".\n\nNew Queer Cinema of the 1990s represented a new era of independent films. Often directed and or written by openly gay people they featured mostly LGBT characters who were open about their sexual orientation or gender identity and oftentimes openly rejected both homophobia (and transphobia) as well as the idea that all LGBT characters in film needed to be \"positive\" or politically correct role models.\n\nAlongside these independent films, mainstream Hollywood increasingly began to treat homosexuality as a normal part of human sexuality and gay people as a minority group, entitled to dignity and respect. Overt bigotry against gay people on screen became akin to overt racism, sexism or anti-Semitism. A-list Hollywood stars were more eager to play a gay character in a film.\n\nInitially, most of these Hollywood depictions were in the context of campy, funny characters, often in drag on some sort of adventure or farce, while teaching a lesson in tolerance, if not equality. Drag portrayals also made a comeback in many films of the 1990s, notably \"The Birdcage\" (1996), starring Robin Williams and Nathan Lane, \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" (1993), also starring Robin Williams, \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" (1994), starring Guy Pearce, and \"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar\" (1995), starring Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo.\n\nWhile likable, decent gay characters were more common in mainstream Hollywood films, same-sex relationships, public displays of affection and intimacy were still generally taboo in mainstream Hollywood films. In the 1990s, the protagonist, or his best friend, in a Hollywood film could be LGBT, and a decent person, but, compared to heterosexual characters in films, the price of this progress was little to no on-screen same-sex intimacy or sexuality.\n\nOutside of independent films or films made primarily for a gay audience, this trend did not really change in America until Ang Lee's \"Brokeback Mountain\" (2005), which was a major benchmark in modern gay cinema. It was one of the first major motion pictures to feature a love story with two leading homosexual roles. The film provided a new mainstream outlook of homosexuality on film and in society. Other films such \"Boys Don't Cry\" (1999), \"Monster\" (2003), \"Milk\" (2008), and \"Black Swan\" (2010) all feature famous actors and actresses portraying homosexual characters searching for love and happiness in oppressive societies. It has become very frequent in modern cinema to see these types of lead roles being played by popular celebrities, which was quite rare decades before.\n\nAs the gay rights movement still paves the way for LGBT acceptance in all different aspects in American society, it has clearly created the possibilities of seeing homosexual roles in everyday television and film. It is no longer a full-out moral issue to see two men or women fall in love, have fun, and be themselves on camera. Though it is still slightly controversial to create homosexual characters in leading roles, the public has grown comfortable and has progressed with improving the quality of gay themes and images.\n"}

United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case discussing the nature of the \"right to privacy\" and the legal definition of a \"search\" of intangible property, such as electronic-based communications like telephone calls. The Court's ruling refined previous interpretations of the unreasonable search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment to count immaterial intrusion with technology as a search, overruling \"Olmstead v. United States\" and \"Goldman v. United States\". \"Katz\" also extended Fourth Amendment protection to all areas via the \"Katz test\" to determine when a person has a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\". The Katz test has been used in numerous cases, particularly with the advancement of technology that pose new questions on expectations of privacy.\n\nCharles Katz used a public pay phone booth to transmit illegal gambling wagers from Los Angeles to Miami and Boston. Unbeknownst to Katz, the FBI was recording his conversations via an electronic eavesdropping device attached to the exterior of the phone booth. Katz was convicted based on these recordings.

The Court of Appeals sided with the FBI because there was no physical intrusion into the phone booth itself.\n\n\n\nThe Court ruled 7–1 in favor of Katz, with Justice Black in dissent. Justice Marshall did not participate in the vote. Writing for the majority, Justice Stewart wrote, \"One who occupies [a telephone booth], shuts the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world.\" Certain details, such as shutting the door on the telephone booth, help determine if a person intends for a conversation to be private. Thus, private conversations can be made in public areas.\n\nJustice Harlan's concurring opinion summarizes the essential holdings of the majority:\n\n(a) that an enclosed telephone booth is an area where, like a home, and unlike a field, a person has a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy; (b) that electronic as well as physical intrusion into a place that is in this sense private may constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment; and (c) that an invasion of a constitutionally protected area by federal authorities is, as the Court has long held, presumptively unreasonable in the absence of a search warrant.\n\nThe majority opinion by Justice Stewart did not dispute that a magistrate \"could constitutionally have authorized\" the wiretap in this case, but, since such a warrant was neither sought nor obtained, the search was therefore unconstitutional. Likewise, the Court said it was not recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment: \"the protection of a person's general right to privacy—his right to be let alone by other people—is, like the protection of his property and of his very life, left largely to the law of the individual States.\"\n\nThe \"Katz\" case made government wiretapping by both state and federal authorities subject to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirements.\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Justice Harlan built upon the foundations of the majority opinion and formulated the \"reasonable expectation\" test for determining if a person should expect privacy in a given location. Harlan's test, not the majority opinion, is the most common formulation cited by courts. Later, this test was arranged into a two prong test for assessing the reasonableness of an expectation of privacy: If (1) the individual \"has exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy\", and (2) society is prepared to recognize that this expectation is (objectively) reasonable, then there is a right of privacy in the given circumstance. This test was adopted by the majority in \"Smith v. Maryland\" (1979). Harlan basically breaks down what this ruling means for future cases involving search and seizures.\n\nIn his case, Hugo Black argued that the Fourth Amendment, as a whole, was only meant to protect \"things\" from physical search and seizure; it was not meant to protect personal privacy. Additionally, Black argued that the modern act of wiretapping was analogous to the act of eavesdropping, which was around even when the Bill of Rights was drafted. Black concluded that if the drafters of the Fourth Amendment had meant for it to protect against eavesdropping they would have included the proper language.\n\n\n"}

The company was founded by Marek Rosa in 2010.\n\nKeen Software House's technological know-how and proprietary VRAGE game engine has allowed the company to create games that leverage elements of science into the gameplay. The studio's first game, \"Miner Wars 2081\", focused on an open world with destructible terrain, while the second game, \"Space Engineers\", presents volumetric physics as gameplay in a space-based environment focused on engineering, construction, and maintenance of space ships and stations. The company's proprietary VRAGE game engine powers both the titles, and is currently in iteration 2.0. Additionally, they have created a separate team charged with development of \"Medieval Engineers\" - utilitizing similar rendering styles, while adding in weight and block based destruction / deformation with physics based calculations set in medieval times. It offers both a single- and multiplayer experience including planets; from \"Space Engineers\" but with territory based grid system where clans can battle for ground to build on. Realistic mechanical contraptions such as catapults can be created to real-time damage structures.\n\nThe first big project for Keen Software House was Miner Wars 2081, which was presented at Game Developers Conference in 2012. The game received mixed reviews by critics.\n\"Miner Wars 2081\" is an action-survival space-shooter set in the year 2081, 10 years after the destruction of all planetary objects in the Solar System. The story introduces the player to many types of missions: rescue, exploration, revenge, base defense, theft, transportation, stealth, search and destroy, pure harvesting or racing.\n\nThe source code for \"Miner Wars 2081\" was released in March, 2013, under a commercial (non-copyright, restricted-use) license. The code may only be redistributed to allow for \"mods\" of the original game, and the code must continue to perform a license-ownership check.\n\nThe studio's second project, \"Space Engineers\", is a voxel-based sandbox game that launched on Steam Early Access in October 23, 2013, and presents the player with an open world asteroid field wherein they can mine resources, build ships and stations, play with physics, and much more. \"Space Engineers\" is a sandbox game about engineering, construction and maintenance of space works. The game sold more than 500,000 copies by May 6, 2014. \"Space Engineers\" was well-received by both critics.\n\n\"Space Engineers\" is updated on a weekly basis based on stated development goals and community feedback. Since launch has received major updates that include survival mode, multiplayer, dedicated server support and more. \"Space Engineers\" is open to community creation and modding.\n\nOn October 20, 2014, Keen Software House announced that \"Space Engineers\" has sold over 1,000,000 copies.\n\nOn May 14, 2015, Keen Software House announced they are providing open access (but not making the game free) to the source code to accelerate mod development.\n\nOn January 13, 2015, Keen Software House announced their third title and second engineering game named \"Medieval Engineers\". It was also announced that the game will be available on Steam Early Access.\n\n\"Medieval Engineers\" is a sandbox game about engineering, construction and the maintenance of architectural works and mechanical equipment using medieval technology. Players build cities, castles and fortifications; construct mechanical devices and engines; perform landscaping and underground mining.\n\n\"Medieval Engineers\" is inspired by real medieval technology and the way people survived and built architectural and mechanical works in medieval times. \"Medieval Engineers\" strives to follow the laws of physics and real history and does not use technologies that were not available from the 5th to the 15th century.\n\nKeen Software House developed and utilizes a video game engine called VRAGE. VRAGE stands for \"volumetric rage\" and/or \"voxel rage\".\n\nThe first iteration of VRAGE, VRAGE 1.0, was built and tailored specifically for Miner Wars 2081 and the game’s need for destructible voxel terrain and an open-world. With the open source release in 2013 of Miner Wars 2081, the VRAGE 1.0 engine was also open sourced, under a restrictive commercial license. The second iteration of the engine, VRAGE 2.0 is currently in development and powers the studio's latest games, \"Space Engineers\" and \"Medieval Engineers\".\n\nVRAGE 2.0's core feature is volumetricity within the environment. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity and can be assembled, disassembled, deformed and destroyed. Due to \"Medieval Engineers\" development, VRAGE received a fresh upgrade: structural integrity and DirectX 11 rendering.\n\n"}

She had a long career in Irish theatre, mainly as Ireland's première comedienne, but also as a straight actress. She was a regular performer at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin and for many years starred in Christmas pantomime. She became the first star to have a bronze cast of her handprints outside the theatre. She married Jack O'Leary in 1959, an Irish army officer whom she had first met in 1943, and he wrote most of her comedic material.\n\nAmong Potter's many dramatic roles in the theatre was that of Maisie Madigan in \"Juno and the Paycock\". While still a teenager, she toured abroad before World War II as a singer and dancer with Jack Hylton (known as Jack Haylton and his orchestra). On a tour of Germany, they once performed in front of Adolf Hitler and other Nazis. She played the role of Dante Riordan in Joseph Strick's film, \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" (1977). In September 1938, Potter appeared on the BBC Television Service with Jack Hylton and his Band. Film of her performance is held by the Alexandra Palace Television Society. In 2001, the Archivist of the Alexandra Palace Television Society gave Potter a copy of her 1938 television appearance, and she recalled her memories:\"\"I was 13 years of age when I appeared with the Jack Hylton Band in RadiOlympia, a programme that went out on television all those years ago. What I remember most is the heavy ochre make-up the performers had to wear. I was excused the make-up for some reason; maybe mine was such a long shot that it was not deemed necessary. If you blink you miss me! However, June Malo, the Henderson Twins, Peggy Dell, Bruce Trent and Freddie Schweitzer had this heavy ochre make-up plastered on them. Plastered is the only word! Having toured with them for over 12-months and used to seeing them in stage make-up they looked very strange. Mr Hylton was excused also. He was always Mr Hylton to me. He called me \"Morine\", (the American pronunciation, and was a kind man who made such a difference to my career. He always wore those two-tone shoes that were so popular at the time. It is wonderful to see him so trim and dapper in the tape, which Simon Vaughan has sent me.\"\n\nPotter first appeared professionally with Jimmy O'Dea in pantomime and appeared frequently on television and in cabaret. She was conferred with the Freedom of the City of Dublin in 1984, and was later awarded an honorary degree from Trinity College, Dublin. She died in her sleep at her home in Clontarf on 7 April 2004, at the age of 79. She was survived by her husband, Jack O'Leary and her sons, John and Hugh.\n\n"}
{"id": "5328527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5328527", "title": "Mobile television", "text": "Mobile television\n\nMobile television is television watched on a small handheld or mobile device. It includes pay TV service delivered via mobile phone networks or received free-to-air via terrestrial television stations. Regular broadcast standards or special mobile TV transmission formats can be used. Additional features include downloading TV programs and podcasts from the Internet and storing programming for later viewing.\n\nAccording to the \"Harvard Business Review\", the growing adoption of smartphones allowed users to watch as much mobile video in three days of the 2010 Winter Olympics as they watched throughout the entire 2008 Summer Olympics – an increase of 564%.\n\nEarly mobile television receivers were based on the old analog television signal system. They were the earliest televisions that could be placed in a coat pocket. The first was the Panasonic IC TV MODEL TR-001, introduced in 1970. The second was sold to the public by Clive Sinclair in January 1977. It was called the Microvision or the MTV-1. It had a two-inch (50 mm) CRT screen and was also the first television which could pick up signals in multiple countries. It measured 102×159×41 mm and was sold for less than £100 in the UK and for around $400 in the United States. The project took over ten years to develop and was funded by around £1.6 million in British government grants.\n\nIn later decades the term \"mobile television\" was associated with mobile telephones and other mobile digital devices. Mobile TV is among the features provided by many 3G phones.\nIn 2002, South Korea became the first country in the world to have a commercial mobile TV by CDMA IS95-C network, and mobile TV over 3G (CDMA2000 1X EVDO) also became available in that same year. In 2005, South Korea became the first country in the world to have mobile TV. It started satellite DMB (S-DMB) and terrestrial DMB (T-DMB) services on May 1 and December 1. Today, South Korea and Japan are at the forefront of this developing sector. Mobile TV services were launched by the operator CSL during March 2006 in Hong Kong on the 3G network. BT in the United Kingdom was among the first companies outside South Korea to launch mobile TV in September 2006, although the service was abandoned less than a year later. The same happened to MFD Mobiles Fernsehen Deutschland, who launched their DMB-based service June 2006 in Germany, and stopped it in April 2008. Also in June 2006, mobile operator 3 in Italy (part of Hutchison Whampoa) launched their mobile TV service, but opposed to their counterpart in Germany this was based on DVB-H. Sprint started offering the service in February 2006 and was the first US carrier to offer the service. In the US Verizon Wireless and more recently AT&T are offering the service.\n\nIn South Korea, mobile TV is largely divided into satellite DMB (S-DMB) and terrestrial DMB (T-DMB). Although S-DMB initially had more content, T-DMB has gained much wider popularity because it is free and included as a feature in most mobile handsets sold in the country today.\n\nMobile TV usage can be divided into three classes:\n\nEach of these pose different challenges.\n\n\n, there were 120 stations in the United States broadcasting using the ATSC-M/H \"Mobile DTV\" standard – a mobile and handheld enhancement to the HDTV standard that improves handling of multipath interference while mobile.\nThe defunct MediaFLO used COFDM broadcast on UHF TV channel 55. Like satellite TV, it was encrypted and controlled by conditional access (provided via the cellular network). It required a subscription for each mobile device, and was limited to the AT&T Mobility or Verizon Wireless networks.\n\nWhile MediaFLO used the TV spectrum and MobiTV used cell phone networks, \"mobile DTV\" (ATSC-M/H) used the digital TV spectrum.\n\nAt the April 2007 National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) in Las Vegas, the ATSC and 8VSB methods for delivering mobile DTV were shown. Advanced VSB (A-VSB), from Samsung and Rohde & Schwarz, was shown at the April 2006 show. In 2007, Zenith Electronics, owned by LG, came up with 8VSB, which was introduced with Harris Group's) Mobile-Pedestrian-Handheld (MPH) system.\n\nAs the broadcast networks began making their content available online, mobile DTV meant stations would have to find another way to compete. Sinclair Broadcast Group tested A-VSB in the fall of 2006. Their stations KVCW and KVMY were participating in the mobile DTV products demonstrations at the NAB show. A-VSB had worked in buses at the 2007 Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nION Media Networks started a test station on channel 38, which was to be used for digital LPTV, which used a single-frequency network (SFN). In some areas, more than one TV transmitter would be needed to cover all areas. Mobile DTV could have been used at that time because it would not affect HDTV reception. A single standard, however, had to be developed.\n\nAt the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2009, the first prototype devices from LG and other manufacturers were demonstrated, including receivers for cars from Kenwood, Visteon and Delphi. It was announced that 63 stations in 22 markets would debut the service in 2009. Gannett Broadcasting president David Lougee pointed out that many of those attending the inauguration of Barack Obama would likely hear him but not see him; had the new technology been in place, this would not have been a problem.\n\nIn April 2009, the Open Mobile Video Coalition, made up of over 800 broadcast stations, selected four test stations: Gannett's WATL, ION's WPXA-TV in Atlanta, Fisher Communications' KOMO-TV, and Belo's KONG-TV in Seattle. WPXA had begun mobile DTV broadcasting on April 1. The others would begin in May.\n\nLater in 2009, ION said HDTV, standard definition and mobile DTV streams were now available using its affiliates in New York City and Washington, D.C. The \"triple-play\" concept was part of an effort to create a mobile DTV standard. At the time, only those with prototype receivers could pick up the streams.\n\nION chairman and CEO Brandon Burgess said mobile DTV lets stations \"think beyond the living room and bring live television and real time information to consumers wherever they may be.\"\nThe Advanced Television Systems Committee started work on mobile DTV standards in May 2007, and manufacturers and sellers worked quickly to make the new technology a reality. The OMVC persuaded LG and Samsung to work together starting in May 2008 so that differing systems (possibly a self-destructing format war) would not delay or kill the technology.\n\nEarly in July 2009, the ATSC Technology and Standards Group approved the ATSC-M/H standard for mobile DTV which all members green-lighted October 15. The public could be using the new devices by 2010, though watching TV on cell phones seemed unlikely in the near future since telephone manufacturers did not yet include that capability. The technology was expected to be used for Opinion polls and even voting. By the end of the year, the ATSC and the Consumer Electronics Association began identifying products meeting the standard with \"MDTV\".\n\nPaul Karpowicz, NAB Television Board chairman and president of Meredith Broadcast Group, said \"This milestone ushers in the new era of digital television broadcasting, giving local TV stations and networks new opportunities to reach viewers on the go. This will introduce the power of local broadcasting to a new generation of viewers and provide all-important emergency alert, local news and other programming to consumers across the nation.\"\n\nLater in July, the first multi-station tests began in Washington, D.C., while single stations in New York City and Raleigh, North Carolina already offered mobile DTV. The OMVC chose Atlanta's WATL and Seattle's KONG as \"model stations\" where product testing could take place. Seventy stations in 28 media markets planned streams by the end of 2009. All of the stations would have two or more channels each, with \"electronic service guide and alert data\" among the services.\n\nTwenty sellers of equipment would use these stations to test using the existing standard, but testing the final standard would come later, and tests by the public would happen in 2010, when many more devices would be ready. Manufacturing large numbers of the devices could not take place without the final standard. LG, however, began mass-producing chips in June. ION technology vice president Brett Jenkins said, \"We're really at a stage like the initial launch of DTV back in 1998. There are almost going to be more transmitters transmitting mobile than receive devices on the market, and that's probably what you'll see for the next six to nine months.\"\n\nDevices would eventually include USB dongles, netbooks, portable DVD players and in-car displays.\n\nWhite House officials and members of Congress saw the triple-play concept in an ION demonstration on July 28, 2009 in conjunction with the OMVC. Another demonstration took place October 16, 2009 with journalists, industry executives and broadcasters riding around Washington, D.C. in a bus with prototype devices. Included were those who would be testing the devices in the Washington and Baltimore markets in January 2010.\n\nOn August 7, 2009, BlackBerry service began on six TV stations. Eventually 27 other stations are expected to offer the service. By October, 30 stations were airing mobile DTV signals, and that number is expected to grow to 50. Also in the same month, FCC chair Julius Genachowski announced an effort to increase the spectrum available to wireless services.\nAlso in August, WTVE and Axcera began testing a single-frequency network (SFN) with multiple transmitters using the new mobile standard. The RNN affiliate in Reading, Pennsylvania had used this concept since 2007.\n\nRichard Mertz of Cavell, Mertz & Associates says VHF will not work as well for mobile DTV because a 15-inch antenna or some other solution would be required, although he has heard from people who had no problems. An amplified antenna or higher power for the transmitting station would likely be needed, as well as repeater stations where terrain is a problem. Lougee, whose company planned testing in its 19 markets in 2010, said the chip designs with the new devices made targeted advertising possible.\n\nIn December 2009, Concept Enterprises introduced the first mobile DTV tuner for automobiles. Unlike earlier units, this one provides a clear picture without pixelation in a fast-moving vehicle, using an LG M/H chip and a one-inch roof-mounted antenna. No subscription is required.\nAlso in December, the Consumer Electronics Association hosted a \"plugfest\" in Washington, D.C. to allow manufacturers to test various devices. More than 15 companies, and engineers from different countries, tested four transmission systems, 12 receiver systems, and four software types.\nOn December 1, News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch said mobile DTV would be important to the future of all journalism, and he planned to offer TV and possibly newspaper content in this way.\n\nAt the January 2010 Consumer Electronics Show, NAB head Gordon H. Smith disputed the idea that broadcasting's days were numbered, calling mobile DTV the proof over-the-air television would continue its popularity. He said people would use cell phones and other devices to watch, and broadcast technology would be the best way to do this. Wireless broadband, which some wanted to replace broadcasting, would not be able to handle the demand for video services. ION's Burgess showed off one of the first iPhones capable of receiving mobile DTV, while ION's Jenkins showed an LG Maze, a Valups, and a Tivit; the latter sends signals to the iPod Touch and is expected to soon work with the Google Nexus. Sinclair Broadcast Group director of advanced technology Mark Aitken said the mobile DTV concept of multiple transmitters would help free up spectrum for wireless broadband in rural areas but not large cities. He also explained to the FCC that mobile DTV was the best method for sending out live video to those using cell phones and similar devices.\n\nThe OMVC's Mobile DTV Consumer Showcase began May 3, 2010, and lasted all summer. Nine stations planned to distribute 20 programs, including local and network shows as well as cable programs, to Samsung Moment phones. Dell Netbooks and Valups Tivits also received programming.\n\nOn September 23, 2010, Media General began its first MDTV service at WCMH-TV in Columbus, Ohio and had plans to do the same a month later at WFLA-TV in the Tampa Bay, Florida area and five to seven more stations in its portfolio.\n\nOn November 19, 2010, a joint venture of 12 major broadcasters known as the Mobile Content Venture (MCV) announced plans to upgrade TV stations in 20 markets representing 40 percent of the United States population to deliver live video to portable devices by the end of 2011.\n\nBrian Lawlor, a Scripps TV senior vice president said that in September 2011, Scripps stations would offer an mobile app allowing people with an iPhone or iPad to see emergency information (e.g. weather bulletins) in the event of a power outage. In 2012, a number of stations plan to conduct tests of the Mobile Emergency Alert System (M-EAS), a system to deliver emergency information via mobile DTV.\n\nIn January 2012, the MCV announced that MetroPCS would offer MCV's Dyle mobile DTV service. Samsung planned an Android phone capable of receiving this service late in 2012. At the end of 2012, Dyle was in 35 markets and capable of reaching 55 percent of viewers. According to the home page on its website, \"As of May 22, 2015, Dyle® mobile TV is no longer in service, and Dyle-enabled devices and their apps will no longer be supported.\"\n\nAt the NAB show in April 2012, MCV announced that 17 additional television stations would launch mobile DTV, bringing the total to 92, covering more than 55% of US homes. Included are stations in three new markets: Austin, Texas, Boston, Massachusetts, and Dayton, Ohio.\n\nIn September 2012, WRAL-TV announced rollout of a Mobile Emergency Alert System based around mobile digital television technology.\n\nA OTT technology platform called Syncbak enables smart phones and tablets rather than TV spectrum. Syncbak has been deployed across the United States at 55 major station groups, including FOX and CBS affiliates.\n\nBy early 2013, 130 stations were providing content, but adoption of devices such as dongles was not widespread.\n\nWhile traditional pay TV operators and broadcast networks still dominate the consumer television landscape, new options are emerging, from subscription video on demand (SVOD), to electronic sell-through (EST), to free TV streaming. While SVOD drives the most online TV streams by far, the incidence of consumers who used SVOD and free streaming in 2012 was relatively equal. According to NPD’s “Free Streaming TV” report, released in February 2013, 12 percent of United States TV watchers reported streaming TV shows for free during the prior three months, compared to 14 percent who watched a TV show via SVOD.\n\n\"Over half of the viewers for streaming TV are between the ages of 18 and 34, so the YouTube generation is evolving from short-form and user-generated content to TV shows and, like YouTube, they can watch where and when they want,\" said Russ Crupnick, senior vice president of industry analysis at NPD. \"Despite the attention lavished on tablets and phones, an astonishing 83 percent of free TV streaming programs are viewed on a computer.\"\n\nEstimated worldwide numbers of mobile TV subscribers\n\n\n\n"}

It was presented originally by Derek Hobson. It was produced by ATV for the ITV network.\n\nThe show first aired as a pilot on 7 July 1973 and then as a full series from 29 September 1973 to 2 April 1978, it was recorded at the ATV Centre in Birmingham. The show was noted for its theme tune, \"You're a Star!\", performed by singer Carl Wayne, formerly of The Move, and it was eventually released, becoming a minor hit.\n\nWinners occasionally went on to greater success in television entertainment, like Lenny Henry the 1975 competition winner. Many top entertainers began their careers with a performance on this programme. The acts were evaluated by a panel of experts, including Tony Hatch, Mickie Most, Clifford Davis, Arthur Askey, Ted Ray, Ed Stewart, Jack Parnell, Alan A. Freeman, Muriel Young, Lonnie Donegan, Lionel Blair, Ingrid Pitt, Shaw Taylor, Terry Wogan and Noel Edmonds.\n\nFour judges would make up the panel each week. Contestants received marks out of ten from the four judges in three categories such as \"presentation\", \"content\" and \"star quality\" – The \"star quality\" category was later replaced by \"entertainment value\". The highest score any act could attain was thus 120 points. Patti Boulaye was the only act who ever attained the maximum mark, doing so in the programme's final season. Les Dennis received 119 points, with only Tony Hatch giving him less than three perfect '10's'. Arthur Askey was on the same panel and started singing \"Tony is a spoilsport\" when Hatch awarded Dennis 9 as his final score.\n\nThe series was revived by Central for three series between 1986 and 1988, presented by past winner, Marti Caine. Her catchphrase was bellowed at the voting studio audience: \"Press your buttons... NOW!\". The show also featured a panel of experts including the journalist Nina Myskow, who often made critical comments.

The theme park itself, besides the Manila International Airport (now Ninoy Aquino International Airport) was opened in 1970. The theme park proper covered an area of while the whole property associated with the facility measures .\n\nThe theme park was closed in 2002, after a taxiway and service road was built on of the facility for the Terminals 2 and 3 of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. The Tagalog Region, MIndanao Pavilion, Bohol area, and select Visayan sites such as the Magellan Cross were demolished.\n\nNayong Pilipino briefly opened again on December 12, 2004 after a clearing and renovation works. By this time among the attractions that still exists were the Bicol, Cordilleras, Ilocos regions, an aviary, a children's playground, a picnic area and some lagoons. The reopening was done in line with the Christmas season. The park was later closed again but a Nayong Pilipino theme park was later opened at the Clark Freeport Zone in Pampanga. The closure of the park was also deemed proper so as to avoid birdstrikes due to trees in the area.\n\nThe Manila International Airport Authority planned in 2012 to use the Nayong Pilipino property to expand the airport's cargo facility.\n\nThe Nayong Pilipino was conceptualized by then First Lady Imelda Marcos to be a cultural theme park showcasing Filipino culture.

It took place in Oklahoma, United States and brought to light organized crime networks trafficking female minors along United States Numbered Highways, where the girls were forcibly prostituted to truck drivers. \n\nThe operation was undertaken in 2004 and resulted in the release of 23 girls from child prostitution. Twelve pimps were arrested. Most of these traffickers' victims were between 12 and 17 years of age. Lieutenant Alan Prince said that operations like Stormy Nights \"are difficult because the girls are always on the move... and when you find them, it's hard to talk to them.\" This sting operation was headed by FBI agent Mike Beaver, who was working as an undercover agent. \n\nOne of the human trafficking victims rescued in Stormy Nights was a girl named Angie. Beaver called Angie \"a normal, typical American teenager.\" Angie, from Wichita, Kansas, was being prostituted with another girl, Melissa, in the Midwestern United States. They were both teenagers at the time. \n\nAngie was later interviewed in the documentary film \"Not My Life\", in which Angie explains how she and Melissa were expected to engage in sexual intercourse with truck drivers at a truck stop and steal their money. Angie said that, while looking through one of these drivers' wallets, she found pictures of the man's grandchildren and realized that he was old enough to be hers and Melissa's grandfather. She recounts this story disgustedly and almost crying, and says, \"I wanted to die.\" Beaver also appears in the film, saying, \"It's not just truck drivers. We're seeing them purchased and abused by both white collar and blue collar individuals.\" Robert Bilheimer, the film's director, said that Angie did not fit the stereotype for a girl at risk of being sexually trafficked; she was from the heartland, attended a private school and, when her parents divorced, she began acting out as a way of seeking attention. A man abducted her when she was 12 years old, violated the Mann Act by transporting her to another state, and began trafficking her sexually. While being trafficked, Angie was expected to engage in 40 sex acts every night, charging $50 for oral sex, $60 for vaginal sex, and $70 for both. Her trafficker threatened to kill her if she refused to perform these acts. Bilheimer said that the truck drivers Angie was expected to service either did not know or did not want to know what would happen to her if she did not give all of the money she earned to her pimp. Another girl who was rescued in Stormy Nights, one of Angie's friends, was sent to a district attorney (DA) in order to facilitate the preparation of her testimony, and the DA told the girl that he wouldn't talk to her until she had performed fellatio on him. Bilheimer said that, while there is no way of being certain how many girls like Angie are being sexually trafficked, \"diligent people out there have arrived at a bare minimum figure of... one hundred thousand girls, eight to fifteen [performing] ten sex acts a day\" adding up to \"a billion unpunished crimes of sexual violence on an annual basis.\" While Bilheimer interviewed Beaver at a Midwestern truck stop like the ones at which Angie was trafficked, someone wrote \"Fuck you, asshole!\" in the dirt on Beaver's car. Bilheimer said that this act demonstrated that many truck drivers hate law enforcement, although he said that \"there are some good truckers out there,\" like those who are part of Truckers Against Trafficking, an organization opposing human trafficking by raising awareness on the subject among truck drivers. When news of Stormy Nights was made public, there was a strong public response across the country, so the FBI established \"Innocence Lost\", a new department working to free children from prostitution.\n"}
{"id": "5614164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5614164", "title": "Phonofilm", "text": "Phonofilm\n\nPhonofilm is an optical sound-on-film system developed by inventors Lee de Forest and Theodore Case in the 1920s.\n\nIn 1919 and 1920, Lee De Forest, inventor of the audion tube, filed his first patents on a sound-on-film process, DeForest Phonofilm, which recorded sound directly onto film as parallel lines. These parallel lines photographically recorded electrical waveforms from a microphone, which were translated back into sound waves when the movie was projected. Some sources say that DeForest improved on the work of Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt — who was granted German patent 309.536 on 28 July 1914 for his sound-on-film work — and on the Tri-Ergon process, patented in 1919 by German inventors Josef Engl, Hans Vogt, and Joseph Massole.\n\nThe Phonofilm system, which recorded synchronized sound directly onto film, was used to record vaudeville acts, musical numbers, political speeches, and opera singers. The quality of Phonofilm was poor at first, improved somewhat in later years, but was never able to match the fidelity of sound-on-disc systems such as Vitaphone, or later sound-on-film systems such as RCA Photophone or Fox Movietone.\n\nThe films of DeForest were short films made primarily as demonstrations to try to interest major studios in Phonofilm. These films are particularly valuable to entertainment historians, as they include recordings of a wide variety of both well-known and less famous American vaudeville and British music hall acts which would otherwise have been forgotten. Some of the films, such as \"Flying Jenny Airplane\", \"Barking Dog\", and a film of DeForest himself explaining the Phonofilm system (all 1922) were experimental films to test the system.\n\nSome of the people filmed included vaudevillians Joe Weber and Lew Fields, Eva Puck and Sammy White, Eddie Cantor, Ben Bernie, Oscar Levant, Phil Baker, Frank McHugh, Roy Smeck, jazz musicians Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake, \"all-girl\" bandleader Helen Lewis, harmonicist Borrah Minevitch, Nikita Balieff's company La Chauve-Souris, opera singers Eva Leoni, Abbie Mitchell, and Marie Rappold, Broadway stars Helen Menken and Fannie Ward, folklorist Charles Ross Taggart, copla singer Concha Piquer (first Spanish sound film), and politicians Calvin Coolidge, Robert La Follette, Al Smith, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Smith and Roosevelt were filmed during the 1924 Democratic National Convention, held June 24 to July 9 at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Coolidge became the first U. S. President to appear in a sound motion picture when DeForest filmed him at the White House on 11 August 1924.\n\nIn November 1922, De Forest founded the De Forest Phonofilm Corporation with studios at 314 East 48th Street in New York City, and offices at 220 West 42nd Street in the Candler Building. However, DeForest was unable to interest any of the major Hollywood movie studios in his invention.\nFrom October 1921 to September 1922, DeForest lived in Berlin, meeting with the Tri-Ergon developers and investigating other European sound film systems. He announced to the press in April 1922 that he would soon have a workable sound-on-film system.\n\nOn 12 March 1923, DeForest presented a demonstration of Phonofilm to the press. On 12 April 1923, DeForest gave a private demonstration of the process to electrical engineers at the Engineering Society Building's Auditorium at 33 West 39th Street in New York City.\n\nOn 15 April 1923, DeForest premiered 18 short films made in Phonofilm — including vaudeville acts, musical performers, opera, and ballet — at the Rivoli Theater at 1620 Broadway in New York City. The Rivoli's music director Hugo Riesenfeld co-hosted the presentation. The printed program gave credit to the \"DeForest-Case Patents\", but according to a letter Theodore Case wrote to DeForest immediately after the event, no credit was given to Case during the presentation itself. Case also expressed his displeasure that the program credited only the \"DeForest-Case Patents\", as Phonofilm's success was fully due to the work of Case and his Case Research Lab.\n\nDeForest later took his show on the road, pitching Phonofilm directly to the general public at a series of special engagements across the country. The shorts shown at one such demonstration (from an original program at History San Jose, which holds DeForest's papers), exact date unknown but circa 1925, were as follows:\n\n\nDeForest was forced to show these films in independent theaters such as the Rivoli, since Hollywood movie studios controlled all major U.S. movie theater chains at the time. De Forest's decision to film primarily short films (one reel), not feature films limited the appeal of his process.\n\nAll or part of the Paramount Pictures features \"Bella Donna\" (premiered 1 April 1923) and \"The Covered Wagon\" (premiered 16 March 1923) were filmed with Phonofilm as an experiment. (In the case of \"The Covered Wagon\", Hugo Riesenfeld composed the music for the film.) However, the Phonofilm versions were only shown at the premiere engagements, also at the Rivoli. \"Siegfried\", the first part of the Fritz Lang film \"Die Nibelungen\" (1924) had a Phonofilm soundtrack, but only at the New York City premiere at the Century Theatre on 23 August 1925.\n\nOne of the few two-reel films made by DeForest in the Phonofilm process was \"Love's Old Sweet Song\" (1923), starring Louis Wolheim, Donald Gallaher, and the 20-year-old Una Merkel. DeForest kept to one-reel films because he was unable to solve the problem of reel changes—and the disruption in sound which would occur—when a projectionist in a movie theater changed reels.\n\nMax Fleischer and Dave Fleischer used the Phonofilm process for their Song Car-Tunes series of cartoons—all featuring the \"Follow the Bouncing Ball\" gimmick—starting in May 1924. Of the 36 titles in the Song Car-Tunes series, 19 used Phonofilm. Also in 1924, the Fleischer brothers partnered with DeForest, Edwin Miles Fadiman, and Hugo Riesenfeld to form Red Seal Pictures Corporation, which owned 36 theaters on the East Coast, extending as far west as Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nRed Seal Pictures and DeForest Phonofilm filed for bankruptcy in September 1926, and the Fleischers stopped releasing the Song Car-Tune films in Phonofilm shortly thereafter. Alfred Weiss acquired several of the silent Song Car-tunes including \"My Old Kentucky Home\" and \"Tramp-Tram--Tramp, the Boys are Marching\" and re-released them independently between 1929 to 1932 with new animation added using what sounds like the Powers Cinephone process.\n\nDeForest also worked with Theodore Case, using Case's patents to make the Phonofilm system workable. However, the two men had a falling out, shortly after DeForest filed suit in June 1923 against Freeman Harrison Owens, another former collaborator of DeForest's. Case later went to movie mogul William Fox of Fox Film Corporation, who bought Case's patents, the American rights to the German Tri-Ergon patents, and the work of Owens to create Fox Movietone.\n\nCase's falling out with DeForest was due to DeForest taking full credit for the work of Case and Earl I. Sponable (1895–1977) at the Case Research Lab in Auburn, New York. To record on film, DeForest tried using a standard light bulb to expose amplified sound onto film. The bulbs quickly burned out, and, even while functioning, never produced a clear recording. To reproduce his nearly inaudible soundtracks, DeForest used a photocell that could not react quickly enough to the varying light coming to it as the soundtrack passed through the sound gate, resulting in an incomplete reproduction of sound from an inadequate recording—a dual failure. DeForest's attempts to record and reproduce sound failed at every turn until he used inventions provided by Case.\n\nHaving failed to create a workable sound-on-film system by 1921, DeForest contacted Case to inquire about using a Case Research Lab invention, the Thallofide (thallium oxysulfide) Cell, for reproducing the recorded sound. Case provided DeForest with that major upgrade and later provided him with another Case Research Lab creation, the AEO Light, to use for recording the soundtrack. Due to DeForest's continuing misuse of these inventions, the Case Research Lab proceeded to build its own camera. That camera was used by Case and Sponable to film President Coolidge on 11 August 1924, creating one of the films shown by DeForest and claimed by him to be the product of \"his\" inventions.\n\nSeeing that DeForest was more concerned with his own fame and recognition than he was with actually creating a workable system of sound film, and because of DeForest's continuing attempts to downplay the contributions of the Case Research Lab in the creation of Phonofilm, Case severed his ties with DeForest in the fall of 1925. On 23 July 1926, William Fox of Fox Film Corporation bought Case's patents.\n\nIn 1924, Western Electric had settled on 24 frames per second (90 feet per minute) as the standard film speed for both the sound-on-disc and optical sound systems it was developing. Western Electric's ERPI division dominated the theater hardware market when the sound revolution finally got underway, so its new standard speed was universally adopted by Fox and all the other studios as each began making sound films. (See the Fleischer cartoon \"Finding His Voice\" (1929), credited to Mr. W. E. Erpi.) As a consequence, Case's tests and DeForest's early Phonofilms, shot at about 21 frames per second, gave speakers and singers laughably high-pitched \"helium voices\" if they were run on a standard sound projector. The Library of Congress and other film archives have printed new copies of some early Phonofilms, modifying them by periodically duplicating frames and correspondingly \"stretching\" the soundtracks to make them compatible with standard projectors and telecine equipment.\n\nBy 1926, DeForest gave up on trying to exploit the process—at least in the U.S. (see UK section below) -- and his company declared bankruptcy in September 1926. Without access to Case's inventions, DeForest was left with an incomplete system of sound film. Even so, producer Pat Powers invested in what remained of Phonofilm in the spring of 1927. DeForest was in financial difficulty due to his lawsuits against former associates Case and Owens. At this time, DeForest was selling cut-rate sound equipment to second-run movie theaters wanting to convert to sound on the cheap.\n\nIn June 1927, Powers made an unsuccessful takeover bid for DeForest's company. In the aftermath, Powers hired former DeForest technician William Garity to produce a cloned version of the Phonofilm system, which Powers dubbed Powers Cinephone. By now, DeForest was in too weak a financial position to mount a legal challenge against Powers for patent infringement. Powers convinced Walt Disney to use Cinephone for a few sound cartoons such as \"Steamboat Willie\" (1928) before Powers and Disney had a falling-out over money—and over Powers hiring away Disney animator Ub Iwerks—in 1930. Cinephone continued to be used in low-budget Westerns through 1930, and in Disney's Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphony cartoons—including \"Flowers and Trees\" and \"The Whoopee Party\"—through 1932. (See list of Cinephone titles at IMDB in External Links below.)\n\nWhile shunning Phonofilm, Hollywood studios introduced different systems for talkies. First up was the sound-on-disc process introduced by Warner Brothers as Vitaphone—which used a record disc synchronized with the film for sound. Warner Brothers released the feature film \"Don Juan\" starring John Barrymore on 6 August 1926 in Vitaphone, with music and sound effects only.\n\nOn 6 October 1927, Warner Brothers released \"The Jazz Singer\" with Al Jolson in Vitaphone. The film is often incorrectly credited as the first talking picture. \"The Jazz Singer\" was the first feature film to use synchronized sound for talking sequences rather than just for music and sound effects, and thus launched the talkie era, but DeForest's sound-on-film system was in fact the basis for modern sound movies.\n\nThe Fox Movietone system was first demonstrated to the public at the Sam H. Harris Theatre in New York City on 21 January 1927, with a short film of Raquel Meller preceding the feature film \"What Price Glory?\", originally released in November 1926. Later in 1927, producer William Fox introduced sound-on-film with the feature film \"Sunrise\" by F. W. Murnau. In 1928, the sound-on-film process RCA Photophone was adopted by newly created studio RKO Radio Pictures and by Paramount Pictures.\n\nIn 1926, the owner of a UK cinema chain, M. B. Schlesinger, acquired the UK rights to Phonofilm. DeForest and Schlesinger filmed short films of British music hall performers such as Marie Lloyd Jr. and Billy Merson—along with famous stage actors such as Sybil Thorndike and Bransby Williams performing excerpts of works by Shakespeare, Shaw, and Dickens—from September 1926 to May 1929. (In July 1925, \"The Gentleman\", a comedy short film excerpt of \"The 9 to 11 Revue\", directed by William J. Elliott in Phonofilm, was the first sound-on-film production made in England.)\n\nOn 4 October 1926, Phonofilm made its UK premiere with a program of short films presented at the Empire Cinema in London, including a short film with Sidney Bernstein welcoming Phonofilm to the UK. According to the British Film Institute website, the UK division of DeForest Phonofilm was taken over in August 1928 by British Talking Pictures and its subsidiary, British Sound Film Productions, which was formed in September 1928, it is believed British Talking Pictures acquired DeForests primary assets, including patents and designs for theatre audio equipment. \n\nIn March 1929, a feature film \"The Clue of the New Pin\", a part-talkie based on an Edgar Wallace novel, was trade-shown with \"The Crimson Circle\", a German-UK coproduction which was also based on a Wallace novel. \"Crimson\" was filmed in DeForest Phonofilm, and \"Pin\" was made in British Phototone, a sound-on-disc process using 12-inch phonograph records synchronized with the film. However, the UK divisions of both Phonofilm and British Phototone soon closed.\n\nThe last films made in the UK in Phonofilm were released in early 1929, due to competition from Vitaphone, and sound-on-film systems such as Fox Movietone and RCA Photophone. The release of Alfred Hitchcock's sound feature film \"Blackmail\" in June 1929, made in RCA Photophone, sealed the fate of Phonofilm in the UK.\n\nIn June 1925, Phonofilm opened its first Australian office at 129 Bathurst Street in Sydney. On 6 July 1925, the first program of Phonofilms in Australia were shown at the Piccadilly Theatre in Sydney. A program was also shown at the Prince Edward Theatre in November and December 1925.\n\nOn 6 April 1927, Minister for Trade Herbert Pratten appeared in a DeForest film to celebrate the opening of a Phonofilm studio in Rushcutters Bay in Sydney. On 12 May 1927, a Phonofilm of the Duke and Dutchess of York arriving at Farm Cove, New South Wales was shown at the Lyceum Theater in Sydney.\n\nUnfortunately, Phonofilm had to close all of its operations in Australia by October 1927, and sold its remaining studio facilities to an Australian company in October 1928.\n\nIn 1928, Spanish producer Feliciano Manuel Vitores bought the Spanish rights to Phonofilm from DeForest and dubbed it \"Fonofilm\". He produced four films in the process, \"Cuando fui león\" (1928), \"En confesionario\" (1928), \"Va usted en punto con el banco\" (1928), and \"El misterio de la Puerta del Sol\" (1929). The first three were short films directed by Manuel Marín starring Spanish comedian Ramper, and the last was the first sound feature film made in Spain. The feature film was released in Spain by Divina Home Video in 2005, after years of being thought a lost film.\n\nThe Maurice Zouary collection at the Library of Congress holds approximately 45 films made in Phonofilm. A DVD produced by Zouary about the history of Phonofilm says that a short film of opera singers performing the Sextet from \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" was made by the \"Latin American division\" of Phonofilm. No further information is known about this division of Phonofilm. In 1926, DeForest released a short film referred to as \"Cuban Sound Documentary\" which included the Cuban national anthem and excerpts from \"The Merry Widow\". However, little else is known of this film or whether other Phonofilms were made in Cuba.\n\nMore than 200 short films were made in the Phonofilm process, with many preserved in the collections of the Library of Congress (45 titles) and the British Film Institute (98 titles). In 1976, five Phonofilm titles were discovered in a trunk in Australia, and these films have been restored by Australia's National Film and Sound Archive.\n\n\n(*) Included in program of Phonofilms at the Rivoli Theater in NYC on 15 April 1923(**) Fleischer \"Song Car-Tunes\" series (some titles later re-released by the Fleischers in their \"Screen Songs\" series, through Paramount Pictures, with new soundtracks recorded in RCA Photophone)(***) Found in a trunk in Windsor, New South Wales, Australia in early 1976, and restored by the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia\n\n\n"}

The name \"Porta Genova\" means \"Genoa gate\"; the district is named after a city gate of the old Spanish Walls of Milan, namely that leading to Genoa, that used to be in what is now Piazza Cantore. The only remnants of the old gate are the small buildings that used to house the customs offices, which replaced the Spanish gate in the 19th Century.\n\nAs for all Milanese \"quartieri\", the boundaries of Porta Genova are not formally defined; yet, they are usually thought of as comprising Via Solari, Via Bergognone, the Naviglio Grande canal and the Darsena. The district is centered in Piazza Cantore, where the city gate used to be, and the Porta Genova railway station, the oldest Milanese railway station to be still in operation. The station is the terminus of the railway connecting Milan and Mortara. Since the station is in the centre of Porta Genova, the district is divided in two parts by the railway; an old iron bridge connecting the two sides known as \"la scaletta\" (the \"ladder\"), located next to the station, is one of the traditional landmarks of the district.\nPorta Genova is also characterized by the Navigli canals and the Darsena (the old dock), where two major Navigli meet, namely the Naviglio Grande and the Naviglio Pavese. As a consequence, much of the district is traversed by watercourses. One of the best known landmarks of the canal banks in Porta Genova is Vicolo Lavandaie, a small alley where Milanese woman used to wash clothes in the Naviglio's waters.\n\nWhile Porta Genova is one of the most old-fashioned districts in Milan, and it is strongly connected to the tradition. It is also extremely popular with the Milanese youth, both for the night-life (especially along the banks of the Naviglio) and its anti-comformist atmosphere. This reflects, for example, in the almost ubiquitous street art works, the numerous\" alternative\" shops, as well as the peculiar character of the main street market of the area, the Fiera di Senigallia, which is renowned as one of the best places in Milan where to look for unusual, rare and bizarre merchandise.\n\n"}

They have collaborated with various professionals and companies to produce music, dance recitals, videos and even sports such as a figure skate, facing, basketball and synchronised swimming. They came to wide attention in 2008 with Daito Manabe's YouTube video and 2010 with Perfume's live concert at Tokyo Dome and have become a common sight at Ars Electronica and transmedia festivals around the world.\n\nRhizomatiks was founded as a collective of creative people in 2006 in Tokyo to work on large-scale commercial projects.< One early project was with the Japanese pop group Perfume, work with the single \"Polyrhythm\" in 2007, which led to touring with the band. They became widely noticed with a video piece in 2008 called \"Electric Stimulus To Face\", which had more than a million YouTube hits in its first month.\n\nThe company has gone international, becoming a fixture at transmedia festivals around the world and has expanded its portfolio 10x.\n\nIn 2014, the collaborated with dance troup Elevenplay, appearing at the Festival Internacional Cervantino. They also participated in the Art Fair Tokyo 2015, by displaying their \"mega-synth system,\" which works like a regular synthesizer.\n\nRhizomatiks is an eclectic combination of creators which includes architects, visual artists, media artists, designers, musicians, engineers and programmers.\n\nThe founder of the group is (1976), an artist, composer, programmer, designer, DJ and VJ. Manabe is from a traditional media art environment, with a degree in dynamic sensory programming from the International Academy of Media Arts and Sciences and a degree in mathematics from the Tokyo University of Science.\n\nThe CTO of the group is Motoi Ishibashi (1976), an artist and engineer. Lives and works in Tokyo. Ishibashi studied control systems engineering at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, followed by mechanical and image processing engineering at the Institute of Advanced Media Arts and Sciences (IAMAS) in Gifu, at the inception of digital media production. He met Manabe at IAMAS, who was also a student there. He is currently working on the development of new artistic methods touching on both the visual environment and the elaboration of engineering solutions in terms of artistic production and interactive public spaces. In 2011, he and Manabe were the recipients of an Award of Distinction in the interactive art category of the Prix Ars Electronica. That same year, he received the Excellence Award at the 15th edition of the Japan Media Art Festival. Since 2015, he has co-directed Rhizomatiks Research along with Manabe, a strand devoted to research and development in the spheres of art, technology and entertainment.\n\nFounding member Seiichi Saito (1975) studied architectural design At Columbia University in New York and worked in advertising starting in 2000 before returning to Japan and joining Rhizomatiks. His is noted for this three-dimensional interactive commercial art work, based on architectural concepts. Today he is the director of the company and also lectures part-time at the Tokyo University of Science.\n\nOther founding member is Hidenori Chiba, who has a background in website development. Currently his is in charge of web design, system engineering and programming.\n\nOther members of the company include Satoshi Horii, Daisuke Nakahama, Hiroyuki Hori, Hiroyasu Kimora, Sumito Kamoi, Ichiro Kojima, Youichi Sakamoto, Muryo Honma, Motoi Ishibashi, Megumi Shima and Keisuki Arikuni.\n\nRhizomatiks produces interactive materials with their work crossing the boundaries between design, art and entertainment. Projects often involved collecting massive amounts of data using motion capture, kinect controllers and sensors to track dance movements in order to recreate human forms and movements as 3-D representations in real time. They also use projection mapping, lasers, sonar, robots and even drones.\n\nNew ideas will cross between artistic and commercial projects. The commercial pieces tend to be on a larger scale because of funding. \"(Rhizomatiks) is like a music label\", Manabe says. \"People with similar values gather and each person pursues different projects\". Leadership changes from project to project. \"They’re a challenging group of people\", Shimizu says. \"Whether the project's commercial or noncommercial in nature, they aren’t able to stop trying something new. They are not just artists, they’re also Japanese craftsmen who focus on detail. This might also explain why they are essentially ‘process driven’ (in the way they approach projects).\"\n"}

It made its public debut on 27 December 1922 at the Selwyn Theatre in New York City, the only theater ever equipped with the system. The program included several short films, a live presentation of projected 3D shadows, and the 95-minute feature film \"M.A.R.S.\" (or \"The Man From M.A.R.S.\"), later re-released in 2D as \"Radio-Mania\".\n\nTeleview pioneered the alternate-frame sequencing method of stereoscopic 3D projection. The basic principle had been patented as early as 1897, but the improved Teleview implementation was the first to be presented to the public.\n\nLeft-eye and right-eye films were run through a pair of interlocked projectors with their shutters operating out of phase. Each shutter was three-bladed, so that each pair of film frames was projected three times (i.e., left-right-left-right-left-right) before the mechanisms moved the next pair of frames into position. At the minimum 16-frames-per-second silent film projection speed, this resulted in a minimum of 48 flashes per second per eye, eliminating the severe flicker that fatally flawed earlier systems in which the left-eye and right-eye frames alternated on a single strip of film projected at twice the normal rate.\n\nEach theater seat was equipped with an attached viewing device supported by a gooseneck stand. It contained a rotary shutter synchronized with the projector shutters, so that each of the user's eyes saw only the images intended for it. Persistence of vision made both views appear to be uninterrupted and a normal fully stereoscopic image was seen.\n\nHammond's system won praise, but because of the high cost of installing the equipment, and the inconvenience of having to peer through the unwieldy viewer, it disappeared completely after this lone engagement ended in early 1923.\n\nThe alternating image method enjoyed a revival after the advent of optoelectronic shutters in the 1970s made it more practical. Modern LC shutter glasses are used for viewing projected 3D films in some theaters, as well as 3DTV video and stereoscopic computer graphics.\n\n\n"}

The project was started in 2002 by Bill Kendrick who continues to maintain and improve it, with help from numerous volunteers. Tux Paint is seen by many as a free software alternative to Kid Pix, a similar proprietary educational software product.\n\nTux Paint was initially created for the Linux operating system, as there was no suitable drawing program for young children available for Linux at that time. It is written in the C programming language and uses various free and open source helper libraries, including the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), and has since been made available for Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, BeOS and other platforms.\n\nSelected milestone releases:\n\n\nTux Paint stands apart from typical graphics editing software (such as GIMP or Photoshop) that it was designed to be usable by children as young as 3 years of age. The user interface is meant to be intuitive, and utilizes icons, audible feedback and textual hints to help explain how the software works. The brightly colored interface, sound effects and cartoon mascot (Tux, the mascot of the Linux kernel) are meant to engage children.\n\nTux Paint's normal interface is split into five sections:\n\n\nA simple slideshow feature allows previously saved images to be displayed as a basic flip-book animation or as a slide presentation.\n\nLike most popular graphics editing and composition tools, Tux Paint includes a paintbrush, an eraser, and tools to draw lines, polygonal shapes and text. Tux Paint provides multiple levels of undo and redo, allowing accidental or unwanted changes to be removed while editing a picture.\n\nTux Paint was designed in such a way that the user does not need to understand the underlying operating system or how to deal with files. The \"Save\" and \"Open\" commands were designed to mimic those of software for personal digital assistant devices, such as the Palm handheld. When one saves a picture in Tux Paint, they do not need to provide a file name or browse for where to place it. When one goes to open a previously saved picture, a collection of thumbnails of saved images is shown.\n\nSimilarly, printing is typically a 'no questions asked' process, as well.\n\nTux Paint includes a number of 'filters' and 'special effects' which can be applied to a drawing, such as blurring, fading, and making the picture look as though it was drawn in chalk on pavement. These are available through the 'Magic' tool in Tux Paint. Starting with version 0.9.18, Tux Paint's 'Magic' tools are built as plugins that are loaded at runtime and use a C API specifically for creating such tools.\n\nA large collection of artwork and photographic imagery are also available (under a license allowing free redistribution), and may be placed inside drawings using Tux Paint's \"Rubber Stamp\" tool. Stamps can be in either raster (bitmap) format (in PNG format, supporting 24bpp and full alpha transparency), or as vector graphics (in SVG format) on many platforms Tux Paint supports. As of mid-2008, over 800 stamps are included in the stamps collection.\n\nAs features are added to Tux Paint, configuration options have been added that allow parents and teachers to disable features and alter the behavior to better suit their children's or students' needs, or to better integrate the software in their home or school computing environment. Typical options, such as enabling or disabling sound effects and full-screen mode are available. There are also options that help make Tux Paint suitable for younger or disabled children, such as displaying text using only uppercase letters or ignoring the distinction between buttons on the mouse.\n\nTux Paint has been translated into numerous languages, and has support for the display of text in languages that use non-Latin character sets, such as Japanese, Greek, or Telugu. As of June 2008, over 80 languages are supported. Correct support for complex languages requires Pango. Sound effects and descriptive sounds for stamp imagery can also be localized. Tux Paint includes its own form of input method support, allowing entry of non-Latin characters using the 'Text' tool. Japanese (Romanized Hiragana and Romanized Katakana), Korean (Hangul 2-bul) and Traditional Chinese are currently supported.\n\nTux Paint is included with the software that comes with the ASUS Eee PC. It is also a standard package in educationally oriented Linux distributions, such as Debian Jr. and Edubuntu, as an optional package in numerous other Linux distributions, as well as part of numerous educationally oriented Linux Live CDs. It is included in various software collections for Windows (such as GNUWin II and Open Source Software CD), as well as in portable software collections for Windows, since it can be run as a stand-alone application (without needing to be installed system-wide). Tux Paint is also available as an activity within the free and open source educational suite GCompris.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1872089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1872089", "title": "Warsaw Concerto", "text": "Warsaw Concerto\n\nThe Warsaw Concerto is a short work for piano and orchestra by Richard Addinsell, written for the 1941 British film \"Dangerous Moonlight\", which is about the Polish struggle against the 1939 invasion by Nazi Germany. In performance it normally lasts just under ten minutes. The concerto is an example of programme music, representing both the struggle for Warsaw and the romance of the leading characters in the film. It became very popular in Britain during World War II.\n\nThe concerto is written in imitation of the style of Sergei Rachmaninoff. It initiated a trend for similar short piano concertos in the Romantic style, which have been dubbed \"tabloid concertos\".\n\nThe composer, Richard Addinsell, was born in London and initially studied law before turning to a career in music. His time at the Royal College of Music was brief, as he was soon drawn to musical theatre, and he also wrote for radio, but his most memorable contributions are to a series of film scores beginning in 1936. He wrote the music for the 1939 film \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\", the original \"Gaslight\" (released in 1940, not to be confused with the later Hollywood version), \"Scrooge\", and \"Dangerous Moonlight\" (1941, also released in the US as \"Suicide Squadron\"). It is this last picture that began the trend of “tabloid concertos,” classical-style compositions written for performance in movies. John Huntley explores the reason behind this concept: \nThe associations which individual members of the audience may have in relation to a certain piece of well-known music are quite beyond the control of the director of a film in which it is used…. And so with \"Dangerous Moonlight\" it was rightly decided to have a piece of music specially written, that could be used to become associated in the mind of the audience with Poland, air raids in Warsaw, and whatever the director wanted to suggest.\n\nThe concerto was not part of the original plan. According to Roy Douglas, at that time orchestrator for all of Addinsell's scores: \"The film's director had originally wanted to use Sergei Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto, but this idea was either forbidden by the copyright owners or was far too expensive\". Thus Addinsell wanted the piece to sound as much like Rachmaninoff as possible, and Douglas remembers, \"while I was orchestrating the \"Warsaw Concerto\" I had around me the miniature scores of the Second and Third Piano Concertos, as well as the \"Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini\".\" And although it is at the heart of \"Dangerous Moonlight\", the Concerto is never performed complete but rather revealed piecemeal. The opening of the work is heard when the two protagonists meet, and it is further developed when they are on their honeymoon. Finally, in the only extended concert sequence, we are given the closing section. But its use is not restricted to scenes with the \"composer\" at the piano. The themes are found as underscoring throughout the film, and in this way a brief concert piece gains a dramatic resonance that belies its small scale.\n\n\"Dangerous Moonlight\" takes place at the start of World War II and tells the story of a Polish concert pianist and composer, Stefan Radecki (Anton Walbrook) who defends his country by becoming a fighter pilot. After an air raid in Warsaw by the German army, he is discovered by an American reporter, Carol Peters (Sally Gray), practising the piano in a bombed-out building. It is the opening of his \"Warsaw Concerto\", at this point a work in progress, and the first line he says to her is, \"It is not safe to be out alone when the moon is so bright\" (referring to the moonlight bombing raids). Gazing intently at Carol and disclosing \"something lovely you've just given me\", he introduces the lyrical second theme of the Concerto. And, indeed, this melody is always associated with Carol. Like Rachmaninoff, Addinsell introduces it almost as a nocturne. Stefan speaks of the piece later in the film: \"This music is you and me. It's the story of the two of us in Warsaw, of us in America, of us in … where else I don't know. That's why I can't finish it\". But finish it he does. Similar to the way that Rachmaninoff returns to his second theme in his Second Piano Concerto, the \"Carol\" melody is used, not only to bind together the emotional strands of the drama, but to bring the Concerto to a triumphant conclusion. Throughout the film, the unfinished piece is defined in a relationship with Frédéric Chopin's \"Military\" Polonaise, symbolising Polish patriotism. It is \"completed\" when the Polonaise elements are integrated with the Romantic theme, implying the fusion of romantic and patriotic love.\n\nWithin the context of its story, \"Dangerous Moonlight\" is also effective in creating the impression of a larger work written and performed by the film's fictional composer and pianist. When snatches of the Concerto are first played, one character tells another, \"I've got the records\", and when the \"premiere\" is shown, we are provided with a close-up of the program, \"Warsaw Concerto\", with three movements listed. Only one movement was actually written by Addinsell.\n\nThe success of the film led to an immediate demand for the work, and a recording was dutifully supplied from the film’s soundtrack (at nine minutes, it fit perfectly on two sides of a 12-inch disk playing at 78 rpm) along with sheet music for a piano solo version. Such unexpected success had another consequence. The off-screen piano part was played by Louis Kentner, a fine British musician known for his performances of Franz Liszt, but he had insisted that there be no on-screen credit, for fear that his participation in a popular entertainment would harm his classical reputation. He lost his qualms when the recording sold in the millions, and Douglas notes that he even asked for royalties (they were granted). Ultimately the \"Warsaw Concerto\" was such a hit that it made the then unusual journey from movie screen to concert hall.\n\nIn his 1944 appearance on \"Desert Island Discs\", Guy Gibson, leader of the Dambusters raid, asked for it as his first choice.\n\nOne commentator has suggested that the \"Warsaw Concerto\" is the most significant instrumental work written in Britain during the war, still conjuring up a time and place better than any other piece.\n\n\n\n"}

He wrote fabricated accounts of anti-communist underground mainly for his own political gains as regional party secretary and later member of the communist highest parliamentary echelons. Due to the coarse and infamous nature of his works, he has been described as a \"legendary socialist scribbler\".\n\nMachejek was born on February 25, 1920 into a peasant family in the hamlet of Chodów. He joined the Communist Party of Poland as a youth. During World War II he served in the Soviet-sponsored partisan organizations Gwardia Ludowa and Armia Ludowa. After the war he became a member of the new Polish communist party PZPR and took over the post of its regional secretary in the town of Nowy Targ not far from where he grew up. Soon, he became a member of the provincial party cell in Kraków, and eventually deputy to the Sejm (Polish parliament) in the People's Republic of Poland. He was selected editor-in-chief of \"Życie Literackie\" magazine under Stalinism (1952) and became a prolific writer of ideological propaganda and coarse, often embarrassing polemics supporting the communist party line. He has also been known on occasion to attack the authorities of other communist countries (such as Romania), but his criticism was tolerated. It is said he always carried a bottle of vodka in his hollow briefcase. Machejek died in Kraków at the age of 71 shortly after the collapse of the communist regime in the People's Republic, and the re-emergence of sovereign Polish state in the Autumn of Nations.\n\nMachejek was a political hack writer. His most infamous book \"Rano przeszedł huragan\" (\"In the Morning There Came A Hurricane\") published in 1955 presented purported crimes in the Podhale region committed by the \"Ogniowcy\" partisan units under Józef Kuraś.<ref name=\"tygodnik-onet.pl/2\"></ref> The book was based on a fictional diary of their leader written by Machejek himself. In an often \"coarse\" and even \"primitive\" prose, Machejek painted Poland's anti-communists as motley crew of bloodthirsty anti-Semites who killed Jews, persecuted the Slovak population of the region and who preyed on innocent people. Although those fragments were simply invented by Machejek, some historians, most recently Jan Tomasz Gross in his \"\" (2006), have fallen for his claim that the novel was based on facts (Kuraś himself was hunted to death by secret police), thus treating Machejek's falsehood as a valid source.\n\nPolish poet, literary critic and dissident activist Stanisław Barańczak saw Machejek's style as worthy of mention and wrote an essay, \"U źródeł machejkizmu\", published in his 1990 book \"Książki najgorsze\" (\"The Worst of Books\"). He suggested that Machejek's style was unique enough to merit a special term, \"machejkizm\" or \"machejcyzm\". According to Barańczak, Machejek's style was a mixture of the worst elements of socialist (communist) literature, namely coarse language of an uneducated man mixed with the pompous and complex officialese of the Party. Machejek, according to Barańczak, was a master of writing empty sentences, which contain no value, no real message, are not meant to be read, but function simply to fill space.\n\n"}
