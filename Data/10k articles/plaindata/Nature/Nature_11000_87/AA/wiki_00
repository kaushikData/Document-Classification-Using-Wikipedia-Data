The ancient Greeks used two words for air: \"aer\" meant the dim lower atmosphere, and \"aether\" meant the bright upper atmosphere above the clouds. Plato, for instance writes that \"So it is with air: there is the brightest variety which we call \"aether\", the muddiest which we call mist and darkness, and other kinds for which we have no name...\" Among the early Greek Pre-Socratic philosophers, Anaximenes (mid-6th century BCE) named air as the \"arche\". A similar belief was attributed by some ancient sources to Diogenes Apolloniates (late 5th century BCE), who also linked air with intelligence and soul (\"psyche\"), but other sources claim that his \"arche\" was a substance between air and fire. Aristophanes parodied such teachings in his play \"The Clouds\" by putting a prayer to air in the mouth of Socrates.\n\nAir was one of many \"archai\" proposed by the Pre-socratics, most of whom tried to reduce all things to a single substance. However, Empedocles of Acragas (c. 495-c. 435 BCE) selected four \"archai\" for his four roots: Air, fire, water, and earth. Ancient and modern opinions differ as to whether he identified air by the divine name Hera, Aidoneus or even Zeus. Empedocles’ roots became the four classical elements of Greek philosophy. Plato (427–347 BCE) took over the four elements of Empedocles. In the \"Timaeus\", his major cosmological dialogue, the Platonic solid associated with air is the octahedron which is formed from eight equilateral triangles. This places air between fire and water which Plato regarded as appropriate because it is intermediate in its mobility, sharpness, and ability to penetrate. He also said of air that its minuscule components are so smooth that one can barely feel them.\n\nPlato's student Aristotle (384–322 BCE) developed a different explanation for the elements based on pairs of qualities. The four elements were arranged concentrically around the center of the universe to form the sublunary sphere. According to Aristotle, air is both hot and wet and occupies a place between fire and water among the elemental spheres. Aristotle definitively separated air from aether. For him, aether was an unchanging, almost divine substance that was found only in the heavens, where it formed celestial spheres.\n\nIn ancient Greek medicine, each of the four humours became associated with an element. Blood was the humor identified with air, since both were hot and wet. Other things associated with air and blood in ancient and medieval medicine included the season of spring, since it increased the qualities of heat and moisture; the sanguine temperament (of a person dominated by the blood humour); hermaphrodite (combining the masculine quality of heat with the feminine quality of moisture); and the northern point of the compass.\n\nThe alchemical symbol for air is an upward-pointing triangle, bisected by a horizontal line.\n\nThe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, founded in 1888, incorporates air and the other Greek classical elements into its teachings. The elemental weapon of air is the dagger which must be painted yellow with magical names and sigils written upon it in violet. Each of the elements has several associated spiritual beings. The archangel of air is Raphael, the angel is Chassan, the ruler is Aral, the king is Paralda, and the air elementals (following Paracelsus) are called sylphs. Air is considerable and it is referred to the upper left point of the pentagram in the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram. Many of these associations have since spread throughout the occult community.\n\nIn the Golden Dawn and many other magical systems, each element is associated with one of the cardinal points and is placed under the care of guardian Watchtowers. The Watchtowers derive from the Enochian system of magic founded by Dee. In the Golden Dawn, they are represented by the Enochian elemental tablets. Air is associated with the east, which is guarded by the First Watchtower.\nAir is one of the five elements that appear in most Wiccan and Pagan traditions. Wicca in particular was influenced by the Golden Dawn system of magic and Aleister Crowley's mysticism.\n\nIn Hinduism, \"Vayu\" (Sanskrit वायु ), also known as \"Vāta\" वात, \"Pavana\" पवन (meaning the Purifier), or \"Prāna,\" is a primary deity, who is the father of Bhima and the spiritual father of Lord Hanuman. As the words for air (Vāyu) or wind (Pavana) it is one of the \"Panchamahābhuta\" the \"five great elements\" in Hinduism. \n\nAir is not one of the traditional five Chinese classical elements. Nevertheless, the ancient Chinese concept of \"Qi\" or \"chi\" is believed to be close to that of air. \"Qi\" is believed to be part of every living thing that exists, as a kind of \"life force\" or \"spiritual energy\". It is frequently translated as \"energy flow\", or literally as \"air\" or \"breath\". (For example, \"tiānqì\", literally \"sky breath\", is the Chinese word for \"weather\"). The concept of qi is often reified, however no scientific evidence supports its existence.\n\nThe element air also appears as a concept in the Buddhist philosophy which has an ancient history in China.\n\nSome Western modern occultists equate the Chinese classical element of metal with \"air\", others with wood due to the elemental association of wind and wood in the bagua.\n\nEnlil was the god of air in ancient Sumer. Shu was the ancient Egyptian deity of air and the husband of Tefnut, goddess of moisture. He became an emblem of strength by virtue of his role in separating Nut from Geb. Shu played a primary role in the Coffin Texts, which were spells intended to help the deceased reach the realm of the afterlife safely. On the way to the sky, the spirit had to travel through the air as one spell indicates: \"I have gone up in Shu, I have climbed on the sunbeams.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11060987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11060987", "title": "Baptismal regeneration", "text": "Baptismal regeneration\n\nBaptismal regeneration is the name given to doctrines held by major Christian denominations which maintain that salvation is intimately linked to the act of baptism, and that salvation is impossible apart from it. Etymologically, the term means \"being born again\" (regeneration, or rebirth) \"through baptism\" (baptismal). Etymology concerns the origins and root meanings of words, but these \"continually change their meaning, … sometimes moving out of any recognisable contact with their origin … It is nowadays generally agreed that current usage determines meaning.\" While for Reformed theologian Louis Berkhof, \"regeneration\" and \"new birth\" are synonymous, Herbert Lockyer treats the two terms as different in meaning in one publication, but in another states that baptism signifies regeneration.\n\nThe term is associated with , where Jesus tells Nicodemus, a Pharisee and member of the Jewish ruling council, that \"unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God ... unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God\".\n\nOne of the earliest of the Church Fathers to enunciate clearly and unambiguously the doctrine of baptismal regeneration (\"the idea that salvation happens at and by water baptism duly administered\") was Cyprian (c. 200 – 258): \"While he attributed all the saving energy to the grace of God, he considered the 'laver of saving water' the instrument of God that makes a person 'born again,' receiving a new life and putting off what he had previously been. The 'water of new birth' animated him to new life by the Spirit of holiness working through it.\"\n\nAdherents of this doctrine include the Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran, and Anglican (especially its High-Church and Anglo-Catholic parties) churches. In addition, churches originating out of the American Restoration Movement, mainly the Churches of Christ, are also commonly believed to hold to this doctrine, though they dispute this to be the case.\n\nSection 1215 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \"This sacrament [baptism] is also called 'the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit,' for it signifies and actually brings about the birth of water and the Spirit without which no one 'can enter the kingdom of God.' (Titus 3:5)\" Quoting the Decree on the Church's Missionary Activity:14(para 1), Christopher J. Walsh comments that the Second Vatican Council reaffirms the traditional understanding of Christian initiation as a unity and a process. \"It is not something achieved with a trickle of water one Sunday afternoon, but a progressive entry into a commitment and a relationship ... Becoming a Christian is a conversion a growing adherence to Christ in faith and sacrament over an extended period of time.\" (See also Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1229–31)\n\nAgainst this background the more detailed doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church can be summed up in the following statements from that catechism:\n\nSaint Cyprian of Carthage explained the salvation promised by Jesus to one of the thieves crucified with him (\"Today, you shall be with me in paradise\", ) but who is not reported to have been baptized with water, by saying he was baptized in his own blood as a martyr, an opinion shared by Saint Jerome, while Saint Augustine of Hippo said that \"the thief received the baptism of substitution ... through the faith and conversion of the heart, taking into account that circumstances made it impossible for him to celebrate the sacrament\".\n\nAugustine's explanation corresponds to the Roman Catholic Church teaching of the existence of \"baptism by desire\" for those who would partake of the Sacrament if they could and experience a perfect desire to do all that pertains to salvation, but are prevented from receiving baptism by circumstances beyond their control, while Cyprian's corresponds to the same Church's teaching on \"baptism of blood\" for martyrs.\n\nThe following claims are made on websites associated with Orthodox Churches:\n\nIf infants can receive the blessings of laying of hands by the Lord, they can also receive baptismal grace of regeneration. The theology behind this is that grace precedes faith (Eph. 2: 8) and prevenial grace is a reality. The initiative is from God always. If God takes the first step in dying for us, He also takes the first step in saving through the free gift of regeneration without the precondition of faith. The Syrian Orthodox Church in North America\n\nMartin Luther elaborated the regeneration and the saving power in Baptism:\n\nLutheranism affirms baptismal regeneration, believing that baptism is a means of grace, instead of human works, through which God creates and strengthens faith.\n\nLutherans believe that the Bible shows how Christians are connected through baptism with Christ and the new life Christ's work gives us. The Bible's author uses the picture of cleansing to show how baptism applies Jesus Christ's saving work to receivers. Lutherans believe that the Bible depicts the connection between faith, baptism and being clothed with Christ. The result of the connection is that Christians are children of God with all the rights, privileges and blessings that go with that status. Lutherans state that in his letter to Titus, Paul introduces the work of the Holy Spirit, again linking baptism, new life, and the blessings Jesus has won. Lutheran scholars concluded that in the Scripture:\n\nArticle 251 of Luther's Small Catechism and other Lutheran teachings, however, also recognize that baptism is not \"absolutely\" necessary: Lutherans agree that one can be saved without baptism, and a baptized Christian can lose salvation if he later falls from faith; 20th-century Lutheran theologian Edmund Schlink, citing Titus 3:5, comments: \"In this act of salvation all human activity is expressly excluded. It is done entirely by God's deed, by the one act of the washing and the activity of the Spirit through which regeneration and renewal take place.\"\n\nHowever, Luther's Small Catechism also states that baptism \"works forgiveness of sins, delivers from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, as the words and promises of God declare.\"\n\nLuther, in his Large Catechism (XIII), also wrote the following: \"Moreover, that it is most solemnly and strictly commanded that we must be baptized or we cannot be saved\". According to a Lutheran writer, \"[i]t is in the context of writing against people who believed that 'Baptism is an external thing, and that external things are no benefit'...Luther's point was that since the Lord instituted baptism (Matthew 28:19) and spoke of its importance (Mark 16:16), then we are to do as he says and baptize, knowing that the Holy Spirit works through baptism to change people's hearts. So, baptism is necessary in the sense that the Lord commands us to administer baptism: it is not for us to decide whether or not we are going to do what the Lord says.\" \n\nIn 1552 an invitation to the congregation was inserted into the Anglican baptism rite to give thanks to God that the newly baptized are \"regenerate and grafted into the body of Christ's congregation\". There were at least three periods in the history of English Anglicanism when the doctrine caused heated debate. In the seventeenth century, some puritans objected strongly (it was mentioned specifically at the Savoy Conference in 1660); the subject come to the fore again in 1810 and after the rise of the Tractarian Movement it was again hotly debated and gave rise to the celebrated Gorham Case.\n\nIn his summary of the situation from 1810 onwards, Nockles detects at least seven different strands of thought on the subject:\n\nGriffith Thomas summed it up as follows: \"Articles XXV, XXVI, XXVII are all clearly against the \"opus operatum\"[i.e. the invariable spiritual regeneration of every baptized infant (ed)] and yet the Baptismal Service has, \"Seeing now that this child is regenerate\"; and the Catechism also speaks of, \"My Baptism wherein I was made a member of Christ,\" etc. How are these to be reconciled? The question largely turns on the interpretation of the word \"Regeneration,\" and differences of opinion are largely due to its ambiguity\".\nThe Highchurchmen took their stand on the fact that \"the liturgy declared the infant to be regenerate\"; the Evangelical knew this \"and wrote books to prove that he might use the service with a good conscience, interpreting the liturgy in a charitable sense\" Bishop Moule spoke for this second group when he wrote:\"In the sense of title and position, he [the newly baptized] is at once regenerate. He receives the right and pledge and entitlement to covenant blessing. But the infant who in sacramental title is regenerate needs in heart and spirit to be inwardly and really born again.\" The bishop then widens the scope of his argument appealing to sacramental theology in general by quoting Archbishop Cranmer, Archbishop Ussher and Richard Hooker who in different ways state that the outward application a sacrament does not necessarily communicate the grace of the thing signified.\n\nIn the twentieth century, Anglo-Catholic theologian E.L. Mascall has expressed the view that, \"[T]he entry upon the supernatural realm which is bestowed by incorporation into Christ and which is fittingly described as a new birth is also a deliverance from the realm of fallen human nature -- the sphere in which man lies under the curse of original sin -- and an insertion into the realm of the perfect manhood of Christ. Mascall explains that, \"The grace of incorporation into Christ, the normal channel of which is baptism, is a supernatural fact in the ontological order which does not of itself immediately produce physical and moral effects; but it does produce such effects mediately and progressively when, and to the degree in which, the soul co-operates with this grace and surrenders itself to its influence. The work of the Holy Spirit in Baptism has been emphasized by a several theologians. Richard A. Norris has said, \"Forgiveness of sins and incorporation into Christ... are only made possible for people by the action of the Holy Spirit. It is the Spirit who... is God working within people to connect them with Christ and thus to set them in their proper relation with the Father. Baptism, consequently, has always been understood as a sacrament which signifies the gift of the Holy Spirit. Geoffrey W. Bromiley, an evangelical Anglican theologian, has written, \"Baptism as identification with Christ is the sacrament of the regenerative work of the Holy Spirit, not of my consciousness and confession of faith. It is the sign of faith only as this is itself the work of the primary and sovereign divine operation.\" And Anglican theologian and bishop Hugh Montefiore says, \"Baptism is efficacious if it is asked for in faith, in the sense that it enacts sacramentally what has been begun spiritually, and the very fact that it is an outward and visible sign both strengthens the faith of the baptized and is a public witness to that faith.\"\n\nThe Methodist understanding of Holy Baptism is a \"Wesleyan blend of sacramental and evangelical aspects.\" John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church, taught that:\nThe \"Articles of Religion\" in Article XVII — Of Baptism, therefore states that \"Baptism is not only a sign of profession and mark of difference whereby Christians are distinguished from others that are not baptized; but it is also a sign of regeneration or the new birth. The Baptism of young children is to be retained in the Church.\"\n\nThe Reformed confessions consistently teach a conjunction between baptism and regeneration. The confessions teach that baptism is an external sign of an inward reality (regeneration and cleansing from sin), and that baptism actually confers the inward reality which it signifies. The power of baptism, however, resides in the Holy Spirit rather than the act of baptism itself. Further, the application of the grace conferred in baptism is not tied to the time at which it is administered. The promise offered in baptism is conditional on faith and repentance, which may occur at a time later than the act of baptism.\n\nThe British Congregationalist New Testament scholar and theologian H. T. Andrews, after an examination of five texts (1 Cor. 6:11, 1 Cor. 15:29, Eph. 4:5 and 5:26, Titus 3:5), concluded: \"In the light of these statements it is difficult to believe that the more neutral phrases, e.g. 'baptized into Christ,' 'baptized into one body,' imply a merely symbolical interpretation of baptism. With this evidence before us it seems very hard to resist the conclusion (however little we may like it) that if the Epistles do not enunciate the ecclesiastical doctrine of baptismal regeneration, they at any rate approximate very closely to it.\" The twentieth-century Scottish theologian D. M. Baillie has remarked that \"[I]n New Testament thought baptism was closely connected with the death and resurrection of Christ. It stood for the great spiritual event in which a man, united by faith with the death and resurrection of Christ, dies to himself and the world and rises to newness of life, puts off the old man with his deeds and puts on the new man.\"\n\nGregory A. Boyd says that Oneness Pentecostals teach what he calls baptismal regeneration. The publication \"Vantage Point\" attributes what it calls baptismal regeneration to \"Roman Catholicism, Seventh-day Adventism, Mormonism, United Pentecostalism (and other Oneness churches), most Churches of Christ and Eastern Orthodoxy\".\n\nMembers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saint (Mormon) Church believe in baptismal regeneration. Baptism is understood as the means by which people enter the Body of Christ and receive a remission of their sins. Through baptism people enter a covenant by which they promise to come into the fold of God, to take upon themselves the name of Christ, to stand as a witness for God, to keep his commandments, and to bear one another's burdens, manifesting a determination to serve him to the end, and to prepare to receive the spirit of Christ for the remission of sins. The Lord, as his part of the covenant, is to pour out his spirit upon them, redeem them from their sins, raise them in the first resurrection, and give them eternal life. Baptism is understood to represent the death of the old person and their rebirth as an adopted spiritual child of Christ. Baptism is considered necessary for salvation and exaltation. Baptism must be conducted by an ordained Priesthood Holder with a line of authority that can be traced back to Christ. Latter-Day Saints trace this line of authority through Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery who are believed to have been ordained at the hands of the resurrected Apostle Peter.\n\nBecause of the belief that baptism is a necessary part of salvation, some hold that the Churches of Christ endorse the doctrine of baptismal regeneration. E. Calvin Beisner of the Evangelical Free Church of America made this claim in a debate with Jim R. Everett which appeared in a series of articles that appeared in \"The Preceptor\" beginning in May 1983 (Everett rejected Beisner's claim).<ref name=\"Beisner/Everett 1983\">Jim R. Everett, \"Written Debate on Baptism\"</ref>\n\nHowever, members of the Churches of Christ reject this, arguing that since faith and repentance are necessary, and that the cleansing of sins is by the blood of Christ through the grace of God, baptism is not an inherently redeeming ritual. Rather, their inclination is to point to the biblical passage in which Peter, analogizing baptism to Noah's flood, posits that \"likewise baptism doth also now save us\" but parenthetically clarifies that baptism is \"\"not\" the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the \"response of a good conscience\" toward God\" (1 Peter 3:21). One author from the Churches of Christ describes the relationship between faith and baptism this way, \"\"Faith\" is the \"reason why\" a person is a child of God; \"baptism\" is the \"time at which\" one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God\" (italics are in the source). Baptism is understood as a confessional expression of faith and repentance rather than a \"work\" that earns salvation. Douglas A. Foster denies this contention regarding the Restoration Movement as a whole, a contention denied also by other representatives of the movement.\n\nCritics of the doctrine frequently allege that it tends to emphasize external form (including the role of water) rather than internal belief.\n\nSome Protestants claim that baptismal regeneration is not clearly taught in Scripture and thus contradicts their fundamental belief that all things necessary for salvation are taught in the Bible clearly enough for the ordinary believer to find them there (Clarity of scripture; also see Sola fide). Evangelical, Fundamentalist, and Pentecostal Christians emphasize the need for a conversion experience that involves a personal encounter of the individual with the power of God. Generally, these denominations teach that those without such a conversion experience are not \"saved\" and therefore are not true Christians. These groups frequently refer to personal salvation through such an experience as being \"born again.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3602327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3602327", "title": "Buddhist vegetarianism", "text": "Buddhist vegetarianism\n\nBuddhist vegetarianism is the belief that following a vegetarian diet is implied in the Buddha's teaching. In Buddhism, however, the views on vegetarianism vary between different schools of thought. According to Theravada, the Buddha allowed his monks to eat pork, chicken and fish if the monk was aware that the animal was not killed on their behalf. The Mahayana schools generally recommend a vegetarian diet; according to some sutras the Buddha himself insisted that his followers should not eat the flesh of any sentient being. Monks of the Mahayana traditions that follow the Brahma Net Sutra are forbidden by their vows from eating flesh of any kind.\n\nThe earliest surviving written accounts of Buddhism are the Edicts of Asoka written by King Asoka, a well-known Buddhist king who propagated Buddhism throughout Asia and is honored by both Theravada and Mahayana schools of Buddhism. The authority of the Edicts of Asoka as a historical record is suggested by the mention of numerous topics omitted as well as corroboration of numerous accounts found in the Theravada and Mahayana Tripitakas written down centuries later. Asoka Rock Edict 1 dated to c. 257 BCE mentions the prohibition of animal sacrifices in Asoka’s Maurya Empire as well as his commitment to vegetarianism; however, whether the Sangha was vegetarian in part or in whole is unclear from these edicts. However, Asoka’s personal commitment to, and advocating of, vegetarianism suggests Early Buddhism (at the very least for the layperson) most likely already had a vegetarian tradition (the details of what that entailed besides not killing animals were not mentioned, and therefore are unknown.) \n\nThere is a divergence of views within Buddhism as to whether vegetarianism is required, with some schools of Buddhism rejecting such a requirement. The first precept in Buddhism is usually translated as \"I undertake the precept to refrain from taking life\". Some Buddhists see this as implying that Buddhists should avoid meat consumption, whereas other Buddhists argue that this is untrue. Some Buddhists do strongly oppose meat-eating on the basis of scriptural injunctions against flesh-eating accorded in Mahayana sutras.\n\nAccording to the \"Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\", a Mahayana sutra purporting to give Gautama Buddha's final teachings, the Buddha insisted that his followers should not eat any kind of meat or fish, even those not included in the 10 types, and that even vegetarian food that has been touched by meat should be washed before being eaten. Also, it is not permissible for the monk or nun just to pick out the non-meat portions of a diet and leave the rest: the whole meal must be rejected.\n\nThe \"Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra\" quotes a dialogue between Gautama Buddha and Manjushri on meat eating:\n\nCertain Mahayana sutras do present the Buddha as very vigorously and unreservedly denouncing the eating of meat, mainly on the grounds that such an act is linked to the spreading of fear amongst sentient beings (who can allegedly sense the odour of death that lingers about the meat-eater and who consequently fear for their own lives) and violates the bodhisattva's fundamental cultivation of compassion. Moreover, according to the Buddha in the Angulimaliya Sutra, since all beings share the same \"Dhatu\" (spiritual Principle or Essence) and are intimately related to one another, killing and eating other sentient creatures is tantamount to a form of self-killing and cannibalism. The sutras which inveigh against meat-eating include the Nirvana Sutra, the Shurangama Sutra, the Brahmajala Sutra, the Angulimaliya Sutra, the Mahamegha Sutra, and the Lankavatara Sutra. In the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, which presents itself as the final elucidatory and definitive Mahayana teachings of the Buddha on the very eve of his death, the Buddha states that \"the eating of meat extinguishes the seed of Great Kindness\", adding that all and every kind of meat and fish consumption (even of animals found already dead) is prohibited by him. He specifically rejects the idea that monks who go out begging and receive meat from a donor should eat it: \". . . it should be rejected . . . I say that even meat, fish, game, dried hooves and scraps of meat left over by others constitutes an infraction . . . I teach the harm arising from meat-eating.\" The Buddha also predicts in this sutra that later monks will \"hold spurious writings to be the authentic Dharma\" and will concoct their own sutras and falsely claim that the Buddha allows the eating of meat, whereas he says he does not. A long passage in the Lankavatara Sutra shows the Buddha speaking out very forcefully against meat consumption and unequivocally in favor of vegetarianism, since the eating of the flesh of fellow sentient beings is said by him to be incompatible with the compassion that a Bodhisattva should strive to cultivate. This passage has been seen as questionable. In a translation by D. T. Suzuki, a note is made that this section:\n\nIn several other Mahayana scriptures, too (e.g., the Mahayana jatakas), the Buddha is seen clearly to indicate that meat-eating is undesirable and karmically unwholesome.\n\nSome suggest that the rise of monasteries in Mahayana tradition to be a contributing factor in the emphasis on vegetarianism. In the monastery, food was prepared specifically for monks. In this context, large quantities of meat would have been specifically prepared (killed) for monks. Henceforth, when monks from the Indian geographical sphere of influence migrated to China from the year 65 CE on, they met followers who provided them with money instead of food. From those days onwards Chinese monastics, and others who came to inhabit northern countries, cultivated their own vegetable plots and bought food in the market. This remains the dominant practice in China, Vietnam and part of Korean Mahayanan temples.\n\nMahayana lay Buddhists often eat vegetarian diets on the vegetarian dates (齋期). There are different arrangement of the dates, from several days to three months in each year, in some traditions, the celebration of the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara's birthday, enlightenment and leaving home days hold the highest importance to be vegetarian.\n\nThe Buddha in the Anguttara Nikaya 3.38 Sukhamala Sutta, before his enlightenment, describes his family being wealthy enough to provide non-vegetarian meals even to his servants. After becoming enlightened, he accepted any kind of food offered with respect as alms, including meat, but there is no reference of him eating meat during his seven years as an ascetic.\n\nIn the modern era, the passage cited below has been interpreted as allowing the consumption of meat \"if\" it is not specifically slaughtered for the recipient:\nAlso in the Jivaka Sutta, Buddha instructs a monk or nun to accept, without any discrimination, whatever food is offered in receiving alms offered with good will, including meat, whereas the Buddha declares the meat trade to be wrong livelihood in the Vanijja Sutta, AN 5:177\n\nBut this is not, strictly speaking, a dietary rule. The Buddha, on one particular occasion, specifically refused suggestions by Devadatta to institute vegetarianism in the Sangha.\n\nIn the Amagandha Sutta in the Sutta Nipata, a vegetarian Brahmin confronts Kassapa Buddha (a previous Buddha before Gautama Buddha) in regard to the evil of eating meat. The Buddha countered the argument by listing acts which cause real moral defilement and then at the end of the verse, he emphasized that the consumption of meat is not equivalent to those acts. (\"... this is the stench giving defilement, not the consumption of meat\").\n\nThere were monastic guidelines prohibiting consumption of 10 types of meat: that of humans, elephants, horses, dogs, snakes, lions, tigers, leopards, bears and hyenas. This is because these animals can be provoked by the smell of the flesh of their own kind, or because eating of such flesh would generate a bad reputation for the Sangha.\n\nPaul Breiter, a student of Ajahn Chah, states that some bhikkhus in Thailand choose to be vegetarian and that Ajahn Sumedho encouraged supporters to prepare vegetarian food for the temple.\n\nIn the Pali Canon, Buddha once explicitly refused suggestion by Devadatta to institute vegetarianism in the monks' Vinaya.\n\nSome Vajrayana practitioners both drink alcohol and eat meat. Many traditions of the Ganachakra which is a type of Panchamakara puja prescribed the offering and ingestion of meat and alcohol, although this practice is now often only a symbolic one, with no actual meat or alcohol ingested.\n\nOne of the most important tertöns of Tibet, Jigme Lingpa, wrote of his great compassion for animals:\nIn \"The Life of Shabkar, the Autobiography of a Tibetan Yogin\", Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol wrote:\nThe 14th Dalai Lama and other esteemed lamas invite their audiences to adopt vegetarianism when they can. When asked in recent years what he thinks of vegetarianism, the 14th Dalai Lama has said: \"It is wonderful. We must absolutely promote vegetarianism.\" The Dalai Lama tried becoming a vegetarian and promoted vegetarianism. In 1999, it was published that the Dalai Lama would only be vegetarian every other day and partakes of meat regularly. When he is in Dharamsala, he is vegetarian, but not necessarily when he is outside Dharamsala. Paul McCartney has taken him to task for this and wrote to him to urge him to return to strict vegetarianism, but \"[The Dalai Lama] replied [to me] saying that his doctors had told him he needed [meat], so I wrote back saying they were wrong.\"\n\nTenzin Wangyal Rinpoche became vegetarian in 2008.\n\nArjia Rinpoche became vegetarian in 1999.\n\nOn 3 January 2007, one of the two 17th Karmapa, Urgyen Trinley Dorje, strongly urged vegetarianism upon his students, saying that generally, in his view, it was very important in the Mahayana not to eat meat and that even in Vajrayana students should not eat meat:\n\nThere are many great masters and very great realized beings in India and there have been many great realized beings in Tibet also, but they are not saying, \"I'm realized, therefore I can do anything; I can eat meat and drink alcohol.\" It's nothing like that. It should not be like that.\nAccording to the Kagyupa school, we have to see what the great masters of the past, the past lamas of Kagyupas, did and said about eating meat. The Drikung Shakpa [sp?] Rinpoche, master of Drikungpa, said like this, \"My students, whomever are eating or using meat and calling it tsokhor or tsok, then these people are completely deserting me and going against the dharma.\" I can't explain each of these things, but he said that anybody that is using meat and saying it is something good, this is completely against the dharma and against me and they completely have nothing to do with dharma. He said it very, very strongly.\n\nIn the modern world, attitudes toward vegetarianism vary by location. In Sri Lanka and the Theravada countries of South East Asia, monks are obliged by the vinaya to accept almost any food that is offered to them, including meat unless they suspect the meat was slaughtered specifically for them.\n\nIn China, Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan and their respective diaspora communities monks and nuns are expected to abstain from meat and, traditionally, eggs and dairy, in addition to the fetid vegetables – traditionally garlic, \"Allium chinense\", asafoetida, shallot, and \"Allium victorialis\" (victory onion or mountain leek), although in modern times this rule is often interpreted to include other vegetables of the onion genus, as well as coriander – this is called pure vegetarianism (純素, chúnsù). Pure Vegetarianism is Indic in origin and is still practiced in India by some adherents of Dharmic religions such as Jainism and in the case of Hinduism, lacto-vegetarianism with the additional abstaintion of pungent or fetid vegetables. A minority of Buddhist lay believers are year-long vegetarians in the monastic way. Many lay followers followed monastic style vegetarianism on Lunar New Year's Eve, Saints days and ancestral feast days as well as the 1st and 15th day of the lunar calendar. Some lay followers also followed monastic style vegetarianism on the six-day，ten-day， Guan-yin (Avalokitesvara) vegetarian, etc., set lunar calendar schedule. Other Buddhist lay-followers also follow less stringent forms of vegetarianism. Most Buddhist lay-followers however are not vegetarians. Some Zhaijiao lay adherents also do not eat any meat.\n\nJapan initially received Chinese Buddhism in 6th century. In the 9th century, Emperor Saga made a decree prohibiting meat consumption except fish and birds. This remained the dietary habit of Japanese until the introduction of European dietary customs in the 19th century. Again around the 9th century, two Japanese monks (Kūkai and Saichō) introduced Vajrayana Buddhism into Japan and this soon became the dominant Buddhism among the nobility. In particular, Saichō, who founded the Tendai sect of Japanese Buddhism, reduced the number of vinaya code to 66. (Enkai 円戒) During the 12th century, a number of monks from Tendai sects founded new schools (Zen, Pure Land) and de-emphasised vegetarianism, Nichiren Buddhism today likewise de-emphasises vegetarianism. However, Nichiren himself practiced vegetarianism. Zen does tend generally to look favourably upon vegetarianism. The Shingon sect founded by Kūkai recommends vegetarianism and requires it at certain times, but it is not always strictly required for monks and nuns.\n\nIn Tibet, where vegetables have been historically very scarce, and the adopted vinaya was the Nikaya Sarvāstivāda, vegetarianism is very rare, although the Dalai Lama, the Karmapa, and other esteemed lamas invite their audiences to adopt vegetarianism whenever they can. Chatral Rinpoche in particular stated that anyone who wished to be his student must be vegetarian. Contradictory to the compassionate Tibetan Buddhist traditions in which a sanctity of life, both human and animal, is cherished, meat is often consumed as a form of sustenance due to lack of vegetation readily available. For example, Tibetan medicine emphasizes the necessity to acquire and sustain a balance between the bodily fluids of wind (rlung), phlegm (bad kan), and bile (mkhns), in which a meatless diet would disturb and eventually lead to fatigue. The 18th century Tibetan religious leader Jigmé Lingpa suggested that Tibetan Buddhists who wish to consume meat, but also do not want to sacrifice their religious beliefs, should recite a prayer over their plate of meat in order to purify it before it is consumed. This is said to create a favorable interconnection between the consumer and the animal, assisting it to attain a finer rebirth.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4561442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4561442", "title": "Cosmopolitan distribution", "text": "Cosmopolitan distribution\n\nIn biogeography, a taxon is said to have a cosmopolitan distribution if its range extends across all or most of the world in appropriate habitats. Such a taxon is said to exhibit cosmopolitanism or cosmopolitism. The opposite extreme is endemism.\n\nThe term pandemism also is in use, but not all authors are consistent in the sense in which they use the term; some speak of pandemism mainly in referring to diseases and pandemics, and some as a term intermediate between endemism and cosmopolitanism, in effect regarding pandemism as subcosmopolitanism. This means near cosmopolitanism, but with major gaps in the distribution, say, complete absence from Australia. Terminology varies, and there is some debate whether the true opposite of endemism is pandemism or cosmopolitism.\n\nThe term \"cosmopolitan distribution\" usually should not be taken literally, because it often is applied loosely in various contexts. Commonly the intention is not to include polar regions, extreme altitudes, oceans, deserts, or small, isolated islands. For example, the housefly is nearly as cosmopolitan as any animal species, but it is neither oceanic nor polar in its distribution. Similarly, the term \"cosmopolitan weed\" implies no more than that the plant in question occurs on all continents except Antarctica; it is not meant to suggest that the species is present in all regions of every continent.\n\nAnother concept in biogeography is that of oceanic cosmopolitanism and endemism. Although there is a temptation to regard the World Ocean as a medium without biological boundaries, this is far from reality; many physical and biological barriers interfere with either the spread or continued residence of many species. For example, temperature gradients prevent free migration of tropical species between the Atlantic and Indian-plus-Pacific oceans, even though there is open passage past continental masses such as the Americas and Africa/Eurasia. Again, as far as many species are concerned, the Southern Ocean and the Northern marine regions are completely isolated from each other by the intolerable temperatures of the tropical regions. In the light of such considerations, it is no surprise to find that endemism and cosmopolitanism are quite as marked in the oceans as on land.\n\nAnother aspect of cosmopolitanism is that of ecological limitations. A species that is apparently cosmopolitan because it occurs in all oceans might in fact occupy only littoral zones, or only particular ranges of depths, or only estuaries, for example. Analogously, terrestrial species might be present only in forests, or mountainous regions, or sandy arid regions or the like. Such distributions might be patchy, or extended, but narrow. Factors of such a nature are taken widely for granted, so they seldom are mentioned explicitly in mentioning cosmopolitan distributions.\n\nCosmopolitanism of a particular species or variety should not be confused with cosmopolitanism of higher taxa. For example, the family Myrmeleontidae is cosmopolitan in the sense that every continent except Antarctica is home to some indigenous species within the Myrmeleontidae, but nonetheless no one species, nor even genus, of the Myrmeleontidae is cosmopolitan. Conversely, partly as a result of human introduction of unnatural apiculture to the New World, \"Apis mellifera\" probably is the only cosmopolitan member of its family; the rest of the family Apidae have modest distributions.\n\nEven where a cosmopolitan population is recognised as a single species, such as indeed \"Apis mellifera\", there generally will be variation between regional sub-populations. Such variation commonly is at the level of subspecies, varieties or morphs, whereas some variation is too slight or inconsistent for formal recognition.\n\nFor an example of subspecific variation, consider the so-called \"African killer bee\", which is the subspecies \"Apis mellifera scutellata\", and the Cape bee, which is the subspecies \"Apis mellifera capensis\"; both of them are in the same cosmopolitan species \"Apis mellifera\", but their ranges barely overlap.\n\nOther cosmopolitan species, such as the osprey and house sparrow, present similar examples, but in yet other species there are less familiar complications: some migratory birds such as the Arctic tern occur from the Arctic to the Southern Ocean, but at any one season of the year they are likely to be largely in passage or concentrated at only one end of the range. Also, some such species breed only at one end of the range. Seen purely as an aspect of cosmopolitanism, such distributions could be seen as temporal, seasonal variations.\n\nOther complications of cosmopolitanism on a planet too large for local populations to interbreed routinely with each other, lead to genetic effects such as ring species, for example in the \"Larus\" gulls. They also lead to the formation of clines such as in Drosophila.\n\nCosmopolitan distributions can be observed both in extinct and extant species. For example, \"Lystrosaurus\" was cosmopolitan in the Early Triassic after a mass extinction.\n\nIn the modern world, the killer whale has a cosmopolitan distribution, extending over most of the Earth's oceans. The wasp \"Copidosoma floridanum\" is another example, as it is found around the world. Other examples include humans, cats, dogs, orchids, the foliose lichen \"Parmelia sulcata\", and the mollusc genus \"Mytilus\". The term can also apply to some diseases. It may result from a broad range of environmental tolerances or from rapid dispersal compared to the time needed for evolution.\n\n"}

Yergin is vice chairman of IHS Markit, a research and information company which absorbed his own energy research consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates in 2004. He has authored or co-authored several books on energy and world economics, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"\" (1991) and \"\" (2011). Yergin's articles and op-eds on energy, history, and the economy have been published in publications such as \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", and \"The Financial Times\". All of Yergin's books have been drafted in long-hand. Currently a director on entities such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the United States Energy Association, he is also a trustee of the Brookings Institution and a long-term advisor to several U.S. administrations. He is also chairman of the annual CERAWeek energy conference.\n\nDaniel Howard Yergin was born on February 6, 1947 in Los Angeles, California. His father Irving Yergin worked at Warner Brothers and was editor of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" and a former journalist in Chicago, while his mother Naomi Yergin was a sculptor and painter. Yergin attended Beverly Hills High School. He received his BA from Yale University in 1968, where he wrote for the \"Yale Daily News\" and was founder of \"The New Journal\" in 1967. He received his M.A. in 1970 and his PhD in international history from Cambridge University, where he was a Marshall Scholar. While at Cambridge he wrote for various British magazines as well as \"The Atlantic\", where he was a contributing editor, and \"The New York Times Magazine\". He has honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Colorado School of Mines, University of Houston, and the University of Missouri.\n\nEarly in his career, Yergin worked as a contributing editor for \"New York Magazine\". Through 1980 he was a lecturer at the Harvard Business School and, until 1985, a lecturer at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Yergin's first book, \"Shattered Peace: The Origins of the Cold War and the National Security State\" (1977), was partly based upon his PhD dissertation and focused on the origins of the Cold War. It was named \"best book of the year\" by the National Historical Society.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, while a post-doctoral fellow, he began to take a particular interest in energy in his writing. Basing the book on four years of research, with Robert B. Stobaugh he co-authored and co-edited \"Energy Future: The Report of the Energy Project at the Harvard Business School\" in 1979. According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", the book “caused a considerable stir with its optimistic view of the possibilities of energy conservation and such alternative sources as solar power.\" It proved to be a \"The New York Times\" bestseller, ultimately selling 300,000 copies in six languages. Within its first year of release, Yergin and Stobaugh were called to Washington D.C. several times to testify before Congressional committees. He also advised James Schlesinger, the first US energy secretary, around the time of the Iranian revolution. According to \"Reuters\", ”since then he has given advice to every administration.”\n\nHe founded Cambridge Energy Research Associates with Jamey Rosenfield (CERA) in 1982 with the purchase of a $2 file cabinet from The Salvation Army. With Yergin as president, the energy research and consulting firm was created as a \"quasi think-tank and source of energy industry analysis.”\n\nYergin is arguably best known for his fourth book, \"\" (1991). It became a number-one bestseller that won the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction in 1992 and the Eccles Prize for the best book on economics for a general audience, selling around 700,000 copies in 17 languages. The book was adapted into a PBS/BBC series seen by around 100 million viewers both domestically and internationally, with Yergin as the principal storyteller. His next book was \"Russia 2010 and What It Means for the World\" (1993), written with Thane Gustafson, which provided scenarios for the development of Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nHis 2002 book \"The Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy\", written with Joseph Stanislaw, described in narrative form the struggle over the \"frontier\" between governments and markets and the rise of globalization. In the \"first major PBS series on business in more than a decade,” he led the team that created a prize-winning six-hour PBS/BBC television series based on the book, serving as executive producer and co-writer and interviewing individuals such as Bill Clinton, Dick Cheney, Vicente Fox, and Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nCERA was acquired by the information company IHS Inc. in 2004, with Yergin becoming an executive of the combined company and remaining chairman of CERA. Described as a sequel to his book \"The Prize,\" Yergin's \"\" (2011) continued his history of the global oil industry but also addressed energy security, natural gas, electric power, climate change and the search for renewable sources of energy. Like his previous books, it was drafted in long-hand. In 2011 it was shortlisted for the Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award.\n\nIn July 2012, he became vice chairman of IHS. IHS then merged in 2016 with Markit to become IHS Markit, with Yergin remaining IHS vice chairman. As of 2017, he remains chairman of IHS Markit’s annual CERAWeek energy conference.\n\nYergin's articles and op-eds on energy, history, and the economy have been published in a variety of publications, including \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The New York Times\", \"Foreign Affairs\", \"The Washington Post\", the \"Financial Times\", and \"Forbes\". He has also been interviewed about energy policy and international politics on various television programs. In 2003 he became CNBC’s global energy expert, and in September 2011 he appeared on \"The Colbert Report\" to discuss wind and solar power.\n\nYergin criticized predictions of imminent peak oil, noting in 2011 that the early 21st century is the fifth period of widespread predictions that world oil production was about to fall. The four previous times when experts commonly predicted that oil production would soon decrease were: first in the 1880s, then after each of the World Wars, and again in the 1970s. He wrote that Hubbert peak theory ignores the effects of economics and technological advances. Instead of a peak, Yergin predicts future oil production will be more of a plateau, as increasing prices moderate demand and stimulate production. He also addressed peak oil in a chapter in \"The Quest\" entitled “Is the World Running Out of Oil?”\n\nYergin's skepticism toward peak oil has in turn been criticized by the theory's defenders. For example, Jean Laherrère contended in 2011 that Yergin's predictions on energy production and prices omitted key facts, leading Yergin to draw incorrect conclusions. Another industry observer criticized Yergin's statement in September 2007 that the price of crude oil was then higher than justified by fundamentals. At the time of Yergin's statement, the price of West Texas Intermediate oil was US$79 per barrel. The price peaked nine months later at US$145 per barrel before dropping dramatically to US$30 in the 2008 financial crisis before rising again, and then collapsing again due to oversupply in 2014.\n\nMost recently, Yergin chaired IHS Markit’s study on “Reinventing the Wheel,” which focused on changing transportation methods, the role of electric vehicles, and the timing of peak oil demand.\n\nYergin remains vice chairman of IHS Markit. He previously chaired the US Department of Energy's Task Force on Strategic Energy Research and Development. He is a trustee of the Brookings Institution, where he chairs the energy security roundtable. He is currently a director on the Council on Foreign Relations, United States Energy Association, the U.S.-Russia Business Council, and director emeritus of the New America Foundation.\n\nHe serves on the National Petroleum Council, which advises the U.S. Secretary of Energy. He is on the advisory boards of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy Initiative, the Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy, and Singapore's International Energy Advisory Panel. Yergin was a member of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board under Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. In December 2016 Yergin joined a business forum composed primarily of CEOs assembled to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues to President Donald Trump. The forum was disbanded in August 2017.\n\nYergin was awarded the 1997 United States Energy Award for \"lifelong achievements in energy and the promotion of international understanding.” In 2014 the Prime Minister of India presented Yergin with a Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 2015 the University of Pennsylvania presented him with the first Carnot Prize for “distinguished contributions to energy policy.” The U.S. Department of Energy awarded him the first James Schlesinger Medal for Energy Security in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6109551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6109551", "title": "Energy recovery", "text": "Energy recovery\n\nEnergy recovery includes any technique or method of minimizing the input of energy to an overall system by the exchange of energy from one sub-system of the overall system with another. The energy can be in any form in either subsystem, but most energy recovery systems exchange thermal energy in either sensible or latent form.\n\nIn some circumstances the use of an enabling technology, either diurnal thermal energy storage or seasonal thermal energy storage (STES, which allows heat or cold storage between opposing seasons), is necessary to make energy recovery practicable. One example is waste heat from air conditioning machinery stored in a buffer tank to aid in night time heating. Another is an STES application at a foundry in Sweden. Waste heat is recovered and stored in a large mass of native bedrock which is penetrated by a cluster of 140 heat exchanger equipped boreholes (155mm diameter) that are 150m deep. This store is used for heating an adjacent factory as needed, even months later. An example of using STES to recover and utilize natural heat that otherwise would be wasted is the Drake Landing Solar Community in Alberta, Canada. The community uses a cluster of boreholes in bedrock for interseasonal heat storage, and this enables obtaining 97 percent of the year-round space heating from solar thermal collectors on the garage roofs. Another STES application is recovering the cold of winter by circulating water through a dry cooling tower, and using that to chill a deep aquifer or borehole cluster. The chill is later recovered from the storage for summer air conditioning. With a coefficient of performance (COP) of 20 to 40, this method of cooling can be ten times more efficient than conventional air conditioning.\n\nA common application of this principle is in systems which have an \"exhaust stream\" or \"waste stream\" which is transferred from the system to its surroundings. Some of the energy in that flow of material (often gaseous or liquid) may be transferred to the \"make-up\" or \"input\" material flow. This \"input\" mass flow often comes from the system's surroundings, which, being at ambient conditions, are at a lower temperature than the \"waste stream\". This temperature differential allows heat transfer and thus energy transfer, or in this case, recovery. Thermal energy is often recovered from liquid or gaseous waste streams to \"fresh\" \"make-up\" air and water intakes in buildings, such as for the HVAC systems, or process systems.\n\nEnergy consumption is a key part of most human activities. This consumption involves converting one energy system to another, for example: The conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy, which can then power computers, light, motors etc. The input energy propels the work and is mostly converted to heat or follows the product in the process as output energy. Energy recovery systems harvest the output power and provide this as input power to the same or another process.\n\nAn energy recovery system will close this energy cycle to prevent the input power from being released back to nature and rather be used in other forms of desired work.\n\nElectric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving energy efficiency for the stationary power generation industry.\n\nFossil fuel based power generation is predicted to continue for decades, especially in developing economies. This is against the global need to reduce carbon emissions, of which, a high percentage is produced by the power sector worldwide.\n\nETC works by making gas and diesel-powered gensets (Electric Generators) work more effectively and cleaner, by recovering waste energy from the exhaust to improve power density and fuel efficiency.\n\n\n\nThere is a large potential for energy recovery in compact systems like large industries and utilities. Together with energy conservation, it should be possible to dramatically reduce world energy consumption. The effect of this will then be:\n\n\nIn 2008 Tom Casten, chairman of Recycled Energy Development, said that \"We think we could make about 19 to 20 percent of U.S. electricity with heat that is currently thrown away by industry.\"\n\nA 2007 Department of Energy study found the potential for 135,000 megawatts of combined heat and power (which uses energy recovery) in the U.S., and a Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory study identified about 64,000 megawatts that could be obtained from industrial waste energy, not counting CHP. These studies suggest that about 200,000 megawatts, or 20%, of total power capacity could come from energy recycling in the U.S. Widespread use of energy recycling could therefore reduce global warming emissions by an estimated 20 percent. Indeed, as of 2005, about 42% of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution came from the production of electricity and 27% from the production of heat.\n\nIt is, however, difficult to quantify the environmental impact of a global energy recovery implementation in some sectors. The main impediments are:\n\n\n"}

GBD is a collaboration of over 1,800 researchers from 127 countries. Under principal investigator Christopher J.L. Murray, GBD is based out of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nThe Global Burden of Disease Study began in 1990 as a single World Bank-commissioned study, now called GBD 1990. The original project quantified the health effects of more than 100 diseases and injuries for eight regions of the world, giving estimates of morbidity and mortality by age, sex, and region. It also introduced the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) as a new metric to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors, to aid comparisons. GBD 1990 was \"institutionalized\" at the World Health Organization (WHO) and the research was \"conducted mainly by researchers at Harvard and WHO\".\n\nIn 2000–2002, the 1990 study was updated by WHO to include a more extensive analysis using a framework known as \"comparative risk factor assessment\".\n\nThe WHO estimates were again updated for 2004 in \"The global burden of disease: 2004 update\" (published in 2008) and in \"Global health risks\" (published in 2009).\n\nOfficial DALY estimates had not been updated by WHO since 2004 until the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), also known as the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, was published in December 2012. The work quantified the burdens of 291 major causes of death and disability and 67 risk factors disaggregated by 21 geographic regions and various age–sex groups. GBD 2010 had the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation as its coordinating center, but was a collaboration between several institutions including WHO and the Harvard School of Public Health. The work was funded by the Gates Foundation. The GBD 2010 estimates contributed to WHO's own estimates published in 2013, although WHO did not acknowledge the GBD 2010 estimates.\n\nThe Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) was published in 2014. The first installment, \"Smoking Prevalence and Cigarette Consumption in 187 Countries, 1980–2012\", was published in the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" in January, and further installments were published throughout the year. IHME continued to act as the coordinating center for the work.\n\nIn October 2016, Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015) was published. The work was still coordinated at IHME.\n\nThe following table summarizes GBD's growth over the years.\n\nThe GBD has three specific aims:\n\n\nThe burden of disease can be viewed as the gap between current health status and an ideal situation in which everyone lives into old age free of disease and disability. Causes of the gap are premature mortality, disability and exposure to certain risk factors that contribute to illness.\n\nThe 2013 report showed that global life expectancy for both sexes increased from 65.3 years in 1990, to 71.5 years in 2013, while the number of deaths increased from 47.5 million to 54.9 million over the same interval. Progress varied widely across demographic and national groups. Reductions in age-standardised death rates for cardiovascular diseases and cancers in high-income regions, and reductions in child deaths from diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections and neonatal causes in low-income regions drove the changes. HIV/AIDS reduced life expectancy in southern sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFor most communicable causes of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell, while for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates.\n\nGlobal deaths from injury increased by 10.7%, from 4.3 million deaths in 1990 to 4.8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over the same period by 21%. For some causes of more than 100,000 deaths per year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and 2013, including HIV/AIDS, pancreatic cancer, atrial fibrillation and flutter, drug use disorders, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and sickle-cell anaemias. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal causes and malaria remain in the top five causes of death in children younger than 5 years. The most important pathogens are rotavirus for diarrhoea and pneumococcus for lower respiratory infections.\n\nGBD 2015 found that for the first time, annual deaths from measles had fallen below 100,000 in 2013 and 2015. It also found that the global annual rate of new HIV infections has largely stayed the same during the past 10 years.\n\nGBD 2015 also introduced the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) as a measure of a location's socio-demographic development that takes into account average income per person, educational attainment, and total fertility rate.\n\nThe results of the Global Burden of Disease Study have been cited by \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", Vox, and \"The Atlantic\".\n\nThe World Health Organization did not acknowledge the GBD 2010 estimates.\n\nThe following is a table of GBD publications .\n\n\"GBD 2010\" proper means the paper was published as part of the original triple issue in \"The Lancet\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57189380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57189380", "title": "Great Britain and the Iraqi oil industry", "text": "Great Britain and the Iraqi oil industry\n\nIraq's large oil reserves have attracted attention from Great Britain, a country with a high demand for (and a low supply of) oil. British involvement in the Iraqi oil industry dates to World War I. Political influence in the region has given Great Britain the power to establish a number of oil companies in Iraq.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, use of oil rapidly increased. This was first demonstrated during World War I, when the major powers relied on oil to power newly-built naval ships and vehicles. Oil was needed not only for war, but for production in the civilian economy. Britain had to turn elsewhere to address its growing oil needs.\n\nAs Kaiser Wilhelm I and the Ottoman sultan struggled to reassert Ottoman dominion over the Sheikhdom of Kuwait, the British viceroy of the colonial government in India entered into an agreement with Sheikh Mubarak Al-Sabah which created a British protectorate in Kuwait. Britain needed a supply of petroleum which was not controlled by contemporary rivals such as Russia, Germany, or the Netherlands. British Admiral John Fisher wanted to replace Britain's coal-burning naval vessels with fuel-burning ships. This shift was crucial for Britain's two-power standard, which held that Britain's navy should have as many ships as the next two largest fleets combined. The new fuel-burning ships would be called dreadnoughts. Since Persia was within Britain's sphere of influence, Britain pursued its interests in the Persian Gulf rather than the United States or Mexico; at the time, Standard Oil controlled 43 percent of the global market. In 1909, after oil was discovered in Iran, William Knox D'Arcy became director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company; however, concessionary rights in Mosul Vilayet and Baghdad Vilayet continued to be elusive.\n\nControl of their colonial empire allowed Britain to ensure that oil kept flowing into the country. Iraq, from 1918 until its independence in 1931, was known as Mandatory Iraq. Britain controlled the oil-rich territory and began to influence the development of its oil, including a guarantee of an oil-trading deal.\n\nBritain entered into the 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement, a secret pact with France which defined the countries' spheres of influence in Western Asia. The two countries had agreed to divide the region's fertile areas, and the British realised that they had ceded much of Iraq's oil-potential areas to the French. To secure the oil reserves, British forces captured the city of Mosul; this created a power struggle with France. In 1927, the British began major oil exploration and discovered large oil deposits in the province surrounding Mosul. The United States also began to insert itself into the power struggle due to its goal of securing influence in the region. Growing transatlantic pressure led the British and French to sell some of their consortium stakes to the United States. The British, still the dominant colonial power, secured nearly half of Iraq’s oil reserves for themselves. The negotiations took six years, and ended with the July 1928 Red Line Agreement. \n\nLater in the century, Iraq was one of the five founding members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and began nationalising its oil fields in 1961. After the nationalisation of its oil, Iraq created the Iraq National Oil Company. In 1976, after the nationalisation of its oil industry, Iraq established a Ministry of Oil. The ministry was tasked with planning and creating petroleum infrastructure, and established oil companies. Iraq increased its oil production; it was the third largest oil-producing country in the world in 1979, with an output of four million barrels per day. Increasing oil production lead to the establishment of an Iraqi petroleum company which was shared by Shell, British Petroleum and Mobil, and Exxon. The company had a monopoly on Iraq's oil production.\n\nOil, as a natural resource and a commodity, can be identified as a contributor to war. In the Gulf and Iraq Wars, oil and its flow to other countries were factors considered by Iraq and the other countries involved in the conflict. Although political changes, economic sanctions, and war created instability in Iraq's oil production, its production could still affect future oil trends. According to senior British Army official in Iraq James Ellery, \"Iraq holds the key to stability in the region, due to its relatively large, consuming population,\" possessing \"the second-largest reserve of oil – under-exploited\", and its geostrategic location \"on the routes between Asia, Europe, Arabia and North Africa ... the Silk Road.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the ongoing Iraq conflict, the country's oil-production capability reached 2.5 to 2.7 million barrels per day (b/d). The estimate dropped to 1.5 million b/d in 2003 and climbed back to 2.06 million b/d in early 2006. Current Iraqi production capacity is estimated by the International Energy Agency (IEA) at below five million b/d. This figure is expected to rise to 6.5 million b/d by 2022, since Baghdad and the oil companies have agreed to boost crude-oil production in the country. \n\nCrude oil, one of the Iraqi government's most important revenue sources, will continue to be valued for the foreseeable future due to the country's lack of diversification options. According to the World Bank, more than 65 percent of Iraq's 2016 GDP derived from the oil sector. Ninety percent of the Iraqi government’s 2016 revenue came from oil, which makes up nearly all of Iraq's exports. \nAlthough oil investment has recently increased, the government needs to cut expenditures due to falling oil prices (a 63-percent drop between 2014 and 2016) and is focusing on non-oil investments.\n\nIraq's dependence on crude oil has had negative implications for the country and has made it a focus of international discussion. This was demonstrated in the 2016 OPEC production-cut deal, in which all 14 members of the organisation agreed to cut oil production to 32.5 million b/d to stabilise the drop in oil prices, giving rise to further discussions of Iraq’s dependence on oil. Iraqi oil minister Jabbar Alluaibi said in a 2016 interview that his country's crude-oil reserves are larger than forecast, with previous estimates of 143 billion barrels expanded to 153 billion barrels. If this proves true, Iraq would have the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nThe Iraq conflict, which began with the 2003 invasion, has had significant effects on the country's oil situation. Iraq and its oil industry suffered from the wars and sanctions, increasing the need for international cooperation and investment. Operations of the most prominent British oil companies, BP and Royal Dutch Shell, in the Kirkuk and Rumaila regions were also affected by the conflict and have evolved. \n\nThe Kirkuk oil field, in northern Iraq near Kirkuk, is over 100 kilometers long and up to four kilometers wide and has estimated reserves of about nine billion barrels of oil. It is one of Iraq's largest. Due to the conflict between the Kurdistan Regional Government and Baghdad, oil from the Kirkuk field has been a contested issue. After the Kurdish Peshmerga seized control of Kirkuk and its oil field in 2014, the central government re-occupied the region in October 2017 after the Peshmerga ignored an Iraqi deadline to withdraw from the area.\nAlthough the Iraqi-owned North Oil Company has taken over production in the Kirkuk oil field,\nthe Kurdistan Regional Government continues to control of northern parts of the field.\n\nIn early 2018, the Iraqi government and BP signed a memorandum of understanding with the goal to increase production output of Kirkuk to an aspired level of 750,000 barrels/day. BP announced that the company will provide technological support and expertise to develop the field. \nIn late February 2018, the Iraqi government and the Kurdish Regional Government reached an agreement about the production and exporting of oil from Kirkuk. On May 7, 2018, Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said that BP signed an agreement with Iraq’s North Oil Company in the southern Iraqi city of Basra to raise production capacity from six fields in the Kirkuk region to a total of more than 1 million bpd.\n\nThe Rumaila oil field is in the southern Basra region, near the border with Kuwait. Thirty-eight kilometers long and 12 kilometers wide, it contains an estimated 17.7 billion barrels of oil. One of the world's largest oil fields, Rumaila accounts for about one-third of Iraq’s oil production. \nIn 2009, BP was subcontracted to develop 38 percent of the field.\nDeveloped by BP and Chinese partner CNPC, Rumaila generates 1.45 million b/d. According to Rumaila director Mohammed Hassan, \"Our plan for 2018 is to boost production by around 50,000 barrels per day after increasing water-injection operations and starting new energy installations at Rumaila\".\n\nWest Qurna-1, in southern Iraq, has a reserve of about 8.7 billion barrels of oil. In 2009, Shell was granted 15 percent of the field for development. ExxonMobil, which manages West Qurna-1, produces about 405,000 b/d.\n\nThe Majnoon oil field, in southern Iraq, is long and wide and holds about 13 billion barrels of oil. In 2009, Shell contracted to operate 45 percent of the Majnoon field. \nShell was scheduled to cease operations in Majnoon in June 2018 in a handover to the state-owned Basra Oil Company.\n\nThe Iraq Inquiry, also known as the Chilcot Inquiry, was begun to investigate Great Britain's participation in the Iraq War. Its report was published in 2016. According to the inquiry, British energy interests played a role in the government's decision-making about the Iraq invasion. According to the report, the war was driven by intelligence that Saddam Hussein presented a risk; however, diplomatic alternatives to contain him had not been exhausted.\nUK government officials met with BP and Shell officials before and during the invasion to discuss corporate interests and perspectives on Iraqi oil.\n\nOn October 2, 2002, director of Middle East and North Africa at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Edward Chaplin met with Tony Wildig (Shell senior vice-president for new business in the Middle East) to discuss the importance of Iraqi oil for Shell and BP. Baroness Liz Symons, minister of state for trade, met with BP officials Richard Paniguian and Tony Renton and Shell officials on October 31 to discuss their fears of falling behind in Iraqi oil. Symons agreed to address the issue with US representatives, and told BP that a fair share of Iraqi oil and gas should be awarded to British companies due to the UK's alliance with (and commitment to) US plans for regime change.\nOn December 4, Symons met again with BP officials and was briefed about BP's difficulties and concerns with US policies about future Iraqi oil prospects and planning. On November 6, Foreign Office Director General for Europe and Economics Michael Arthur met with BP official Richard Paniguian to addressing post-regime-change opportunities for BP.\n\nOn March 18, 2003, in the wake of the Iraq invasion, Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Michael Jay and BP Chief Executive John Browne met; Browne expressed BP’s readiness to renovate Iraqi oil facilities. Long-term development would be more complex, depending on the post invasion government/situation. A September 6, 2004 internal note between British civil servants addressed economic perspectives and advantages for UK firms in Iraqi energy. When Edward Chaplin met with Ayad Allawi (interim prime minister of Iraq) on December 13 2004, he raised \"BP and Shell's interests\" in the Iraqi oil industry.\n\nJournalists Gregg Muttitt and David Whyte criticized the small interest the Iraq Inquiry put into investigating the role British energy and oil interests might have played in the UK decision to join the Iraq invasion in 2003. According to Whyte, the inquiry failed to address \"political and economic motivations\" other than weapons of mass destruction and was biased.\n\n"}

Witherby, Rev. F.C.R. Jourdain, Norman F. Ticehurst and Bernard W. Tucker, published in five volumes by H. F. & G. Witherby between 1938-1941.\n\n\"The Handbook\", as it was often cited, was itself a much enlarged and revised version of H.F. Witherby's \"Practical Handbook of British Birds\" (published between 1919 and 1924 as two volumes in three parts).\n\nSome of the plates were by Marinus Adrianus Koekkoek the Younger and were licensed after they were painted for \"Ornithologia Neerlandica, de vogels van Nederland\" by Eduard Daniel van Oort (published 1922-1935).\n\n\"The Handbook\" was reprinted a number of times, until at least the eight impression in 1958. The later printings (they were not described as new editions) having a few pages devoted to \"additions and corrections\" to previous \"impressions\", but few of these are of great significance. In only a few cases was the main text correspondingly corrected.\n\nEventually, it was superseded by The Birds of the Western Palearctic.\n\nA single-volume concise edition, \"The Popular Handbook of British Birds\" was produced by Philip Hollom in 1952. It used descriptions drawn from the \"Handbook\" and updated accounts of their status and distribution. Revised editions appeared in 1955, 1962, 1968 and 1988. These editions were far more heavily revised than those of the original \"Handbook\", not least to take account of changes in bird taxonomy, as described in each edition's new forward.\n\nThe 1968 edition complied with the then-new British Ornithologists' Union checklist, and incorporated further research by J. L. F. Parslow. Its 511 numbered pages described 330 species. The eggs of all breeding species were illustrated, at life size, mostly in colour\n\nProduced in 1988, this was the first edition not to include the forewords from preceding editions. The entire text was reset, the status and distribution accounts were again revised, and the species sorted into the then-current taxonomic order, ending with the buntings. The jacket illustration showed blue tit, coal tit and long-tailed tit, with a great spotted woodpecker on the spine, and was by Norman Arlott. 350 species were described. It ran to 486 numbered pages.\n\nHollom also produced the supplemental \"The Popular Handbook of Rarer British Birds\", in 1960. It described over 100 species omitted, on the grounds of their scarcity in Britain, from the \"Popular Handbook\", about 30 of which had not occurred there at the time of the original \"Handbook\". New plates were specially commissioned from David Reid-Henry (and one, of a Baikal teal, by Peter Scott), to add to those re-used from the \"Handbook\".\n"}
{"id": "19950193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19950193", "title": "Hydraulic redistribution", "text": "Hydraulic redistribution\n\nHydraulic redistribution refers to the mechanism by which some vascular plants redistribute soil water. It occurs in vascular plants that commonly have roots in both wet soil and extremely dry soil, especially plants with both taproots that grow vertically down to the water table, and lateral roots that sit close to the surface.\n\nHot, dry periods, when the surface soil dries out to the extent that the lateral roots exude whatever water they contain, will result in the death of such lateral roots unless the water is replaced. Similarly, under extreme wet conditions when lateral roots are inundated by flood waters, oxygen deprivation will also lead to root peril. In plants that exhibit hydraulic redistribution, there are xylem pathways from the taproots to the laterals, such that the absence or abundance of water at the laterals creates a pressure potential analogous to that of transpirational pull. In drought conditions, ground water is drawn up through the taproot to the laterals and exuded into the surface soil, replenishing that which was lost. Under flooding conditions, plant roots perform a similar function in the opposite direction. For a visualization of this process, see \"Hydraulic Redistribution Cartoon,\" Dawson Lab, UC Berkeley, CA\n\nThough often referred to as hydraulic lift, movement of water by the plant roots has been shown to occur in any direction. This phenomenon has been documented in over sixty plant species spanning a variety of plant types (from herb and grasses to shrubs and trees) and over a range of environmental conditions (from the Kalahari Desert to the Amazon Rainforest).\n\nThe movement of this water can be explained by the theory of water transport through a plant. This well established theory is called the cohesion-tension theory. In brief, it states that movement of water through the plant depends on having a continuous column of water, from the roots to the leaves. Water is then pulled from the roots to the leaves, through the plant system, by the difference in water potential between the boundary layers of the soil and the atmosphere. Therefore, the driving force for moving water through a plant is the cohesive strength of water molecules and a pressure gradient from the roots to the leaves. This theory can still be applied when the boundary layer to the atmosphere is closed, e.g. when plant stomata are closed or in senesced plants. The pressure gradient is between soil layers with different water potentials; water moves through the roots from wetter to drier soil layers in the same manner as it does when the plant is transpiring.\n\nThe ecological importance of hydraulically redistributed water is becoming better understood as this phenomenon is more carefully examined. Water redistribution by plant roots has been found influencing crop irrigation, where watering schemes leave a harsh heterogeneity in soil moisture. The plant roots have been shown to smooth or homogenize the soil moisture. This sort of smoothing out of soil moisture is important in maintaining plant root health. The redistribution of water from deep moist layers to shallow drier layers by large trees has shown to increase the moisture available in the daytime to meet the transpiration demand.\n\nThe implications of hydraulic redistribution seem to have an important influence on plant ecosystems. Whether or not plants redistribute water through the soil layers can affect plant population dynamics, such as the facilitation of neighboring species. The increase in available daytime soil moisture can also offset low transpiration rates due to drought (\"see also drought rhizogenesis\") or alleviate competition for water between competing plant species. Water redistributed to the near surface layers may also influence plant nutrient availability.\n\nDue to the ecological significance of hydraulically redistributed water, there is an ongoing effort to continue the categorization of plants exhibiting this behaviour and adapting this physiological process into land-surface models to improve model predictions.\n\nTraditional methods of observating hydraulic redistribution include Deuterium isotope traces, sap flow, and soil moisture. In attempts to characterize the magnitude of the water redistributed, numerous models (both empirically and theoretically based) have been developed.\n\n"}
{"id": "35873982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35873982", "title": "Interior Low Plateaus", "text": "Interior Low Plateaus\n\nThe Interior Low Plateaus are a physiographic region in eastern United States. It consists of a diverse landscape that extends from north Alabama across central Tennessee and Kentucky into southern Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Its natural communities are a matrix of temperate forests, woodlands, and prairies.\n\nThis is a region of rolling plains and eroded plateaus, with a temperate continental climate. It is notable for its extensive karst limestone, which comprise the caves at Mammoth Cave National Park.\nThis region includes a portion of what the U.S. Forest service calls the \"Central Hardwood Forest\".\n\nThe underlying bedrock of the Interior Low Plateaus consists of sedimentary rocks such as limestone, sandstone, and shale. These date from the Ordovician period in the Nashville Basin and Bluegrass region, up to the Carboniferous Period in the Shawnee Hills. The Interior Low Plateaus lie at the southern edge of the glacial boundary. Unlike the till plain to the north, the underlying bedrock is generally close to the surface, and the topography of an area depends on how resistant the underlying bedrock is to erosion. More resistant sandstones have resulted in hillier areas such as the Norman Upland and Crawford Upland in Southern Indiana, while softer limestones have already eroded down to gently rolling plains, like the Scottsburg Lowlands and Wabash Lowlands of southeast and southwest Indiana. The hillier parts of the Interior Low Plateaus are not mountain ranges, but dissected plateaus.\n\nThe natural communities in this region are a matrix of forest, woodlands, and prairie. Today, much of the open prairie and savanna communities have been lost due to fire suppression and agriculture. However, oak-hickory woodlands remain relatively common, and mesic forest is abundant along riparian areas.\n\nOak-hickory woodland is the most common natural community in the Interior Low Plateaus. It is the dominant natural community for many areas of rolling hills, including the Western Highland Rim, Shawnee Hills, and Outer Bluegrass. These woodlands represent an intermediate state between a forest and a savanna, with a moderate historical fire frequency. Today, many remnants have transitioned into mesic forest due to fire suppression.\n\nCommon trees in this community include post oak (\"Quercus stellata\"), white oak (\"Quercus alba\"), southern red oak (\"Quercus falcata\"), black oak (\"Quercus velutina\"), and pignut hickory (\"Carya glabra\"). In more calcareous areas, common woodland trees include Shumard oak (\"Quercus shumardii\"), Chinquapin oak (\"Quercus muhlenbergii\"), and Carolina shagbark (\"Carya carolinae-septentrionalis\"). In more acidic dry woodlands there are stands of chestnut oak (\"Quercus montana\") and Virginia pine (\"Pinus virginiana\"). In swampy fragipan flats, woodlands consist of willow oak (\"Quercus phellos\"), overcup oak (\"Quercus lyrata\"), pin oak (\"Quercus palustris\"), sweetgum (\"Liquidambar styraciflua\"), and blackgum (\"Nyssa sylvatica\"). The woodlands in this region contain a rich sun-loving herbaceous layer, with many species of goldenrod (\"Solidago\"), sunflower (\"Helianthus\"), and aster (\"Symphyotrichum\").\nThe flat surfaces of the Interior Low Plateaus historically contained extensive areas of open prairie. This fire-maintained community was concentrated in the areas of the Mitchell Plain and Pennyroyal Plain with smaller areas of prairie in the Nashville Basin and Highland Rim. Early settlers describe these areas as nearly treeless expanses, containing Greater prairie chicken and herds of Bison. Today, some prairie remains in areas that are managed by controlled burns, or other forms of tree removal such as powerline and roadside clearings.\n\nDry prairies are the most common remnant in this region, due to their unsuitability for agriculture and resistance to succession. They are dominated by \"Schizachyrium scoparium\" (little bluestem) and \"Aristida purpurascens\" (three-awn grass). Mesic prairies are rarer, and are dominated by very tall grasses such as Indian grass (\"Sorghastrum nutans\"), big bluestem (\"Andropogon gerardi\"), and plume grass (\"Erianthus alopecuroides\"). Wet prairies are the rarest and most poorly-documented grassland type in this region. The few existing remnants have species such as gamagrass (\"Tripsacum dactyloides\"), prairie cordgrass (\"Spartina pectinata\"), and many rushes (\"Juncus\") and sedges (\"Carex\"). Significant prairie remnants now remain at Ft. Campbell and Arnold Air Force Base, as well as in a few small nature preserves. Blackjack oak (\"Quercus marilandica\") was reportedly one of the few trees that could occasionally survive the annual wildfires in the prairies.\nDue to fire suppression, forests have replaced many areas of former oak woodland. However, closed-canopy forests in this region are also naturally found in many areas, such as riparian zones, river bottoms, and dissected terrain.\n\nMesic forests are often found in narrow stream gorges. These forests have a particularly rich diversity in spring wildflowers. They are dominated by sugar maple (\"Acer saccharum\"), beech (\"Fagus grandifolia\"), basswood (\"Tilia americana\"), northern red oak (\"Quercus rubra\"), and tuliptree (\"Liriodendron tulipifera\"). In the Eastern Highland Rim, at the edge of the Cumberland Plateau, these forests develop a more Appalachian character, and contain species such as eastern hemlock (\"Tsuga canadensis\"), yellow buckeye (\"Aesculus flava\"), and cucumber magnolia (\"Magnolia tripetala\"). Acidic sandstone cove forests in the Shawnee Hills also contain more typically Appalachian species such as yellow birch (\"Betula alleghaniensis\") and umbrella magnolia (\"Magnolia tripetala\").\nFloodplain forests in the Interior Low Plateau remain relatively common, although many areas have been converted to agriculture. These forests are dominated by sugarberry (\"Celtis laevigata\"), boxelder (\"Acer negundo\"), silver maple (\"Acer saccharinum\"), and sycamore (\"Platanus occidentalis\").\n\nForests were particularly common in the uplands of the Inner Bluegrass region of Kentucky, which has naturally mesic conditions. These forests were dominated by sugar maple (\"Acer saccharum\"), bitternut hickory (\"Carya cordiformis\"), Ohio buckleye (\"Aesculus glabra\"), blue ash (\"Fraxinus quadrangulata\"), and chinquapin oak (\"Quercus muhlenbergii\"). This community is now quite rare in the Inner Bluegrass due to logging by early European settlers. Its destruction was so rapid and complete, that mid-20th century ecologists mistook the successional state of the Bluegrass as its natural condition. Sun-loving species such as hackberry (\"Celtis occidentalis\"), black cherry (\"Prunus serotina\"), black walnut (\"Juglans nigra\"), and white ash (\"Fraxinus americana\") now dominate much of the Bluegrass region. \nBarrens are open treeless areas on slopes, often with shallow soil. These are found sporadically in the Outer Bluegrass, Inner Nashville Basin, Shawnee Hills, and in parts of the Highland Rim. It is unclear whether these communities rely on fire for their openness, or are maintained by soil conditions alone. They are usually dominated by short grasses such as little bluestem (\"Schizachyrium scoparium\"), and large showy forbs such as prairie dock (\"Silphium terebinthinaceum\") and blazing star (\"Liatris\"). Barrens are particularity abundant and well-preserved in the area of Adams County, Ohio, which includes Adams Lake Prairie, Lynx Prairie, Chaparral Prairie, and others.\n\nGlades are areas of flat rock exposures of bedrock. In the Nashville Basin, glades are most often found in areas that were a matrix of barren and woodland communities. Due to fire suppression and other land-use changes, many are now surrounded by dense thickets of redcedar (\"Juniperus virginiana\") and redbud (\"Cercis canadensis\"). Glades are most common the Nashville Basin, although there are rare examples found in the Mitchell Plain, Pennyroyal Plain and Outer Bluegrass. Glades have a flora adapted to extreme dry conditions in the summer, and standing water in the spring. The glades of the Nashville Basin and Moulton Valley are considered a center endemism due to their large number of restricted species. Characteristic species of the Nashville Basin glades include Nashville glade cress (\"Leavenworthia stylosa\"), limestone fame-flower (\"Phemeranthus calcaricus\"), Nashville breadroot (\"Pediomelum subacaule\"), Gattinger's prairie clover (\"Dalea gattingeri\"), and Tennessee milk-vetch (\"Astragalus tennesseensis\"). Glades in other regions contain less endemism, and are characterized by species such as widow's-cross stonecrop (\"Sedum pulchellum\"), limestone skullcap (\"Scutellaria parvula\"), glade violet (\"Viola egglestonii\"), one-flower gladecress (\"Leavenworthia uniflora\"), and poverty dropseed (\"Sporobolus vaginiflorus\"). Glade remnants are common and well-preserved due to their undesirability for agriculture, and their largely edaphic nature. Many examples exist in Cedars of Lebanon State Park, as well as numerous other natural areas.\nThe Interior Low Plateau has an abundance of sinkhole ponds in the karst regions of the Mitchell Plain, Pennyroyal Plain, and Highland Rim. These isolated communities were historically found within a matrix of wet prairie. These communities are often covered in swamp forest, and are dominated by swamp cottonwood (\"Populus heterophylla\") and red maple (\"Acer rubrum\"). High-quality herbaceous examples have species with coastal plain affinities. Many of these communities have been destroyed due to drainage for agriculture.\n\nEmergent shrub sloughs are found along the bottoms of major rivers, such as the Cumberland River and Tennessee River. These are dominated by buttonbush (\"Cephalanthus occidentalis\"), and along the Tennessee River contain bald-cypress (\"Taxodium distichum\"). These sloughs were historically widespread, but dam construction and agricultural activity have destroyed most of them.\n\nA rare wetland type in this region is the calcareous seepage fen. These are found sparingly in the Highland Rim, and are dominated by grass of Parnassus (\"Parnassia grandifolia\") and contain the federally-endangered Tennessee yellow-eyed grass (\"Xyris tennesseensis\"). Calcareous seeps are also found near glades in the Inner Nashville Basin. These communities often have extensive stands of sunnybells (\"Schoenolirion croceum\") and other rare species. Calcareous seeps and swamp forest are also found sparingly in the Bluegrass region. These contain trees such as green ash (\"Fraxinus pennsylvanica\") and swamp white oak (\"Quercus bicolor\"), along with many herbaceous plants that are considered regionally rare.\nThis region contains the richest diversity of freshwater animals in North America. In particular, the Duck River in Tennessee is considered one of the top three most biologically rich rivers in the world, containing over 150 species of fish, 60 species of freshwater mussels, and 22 species of aquatic snails. The Green River in this region also harbors diversity of a similar scale. This high amount of freshwater mussel diversity is due to the limestone bedrock underlying much of the region. The limestone creates calcareous water that acts as a buffer against acidity, which helps the mussels in shell-building.\n\nBirds of the woodlands include vireos and tanagers while mammals include Eastern gray squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons and opossums.\n\nThe dominance of oak in this part of the pre-Columbian savannas of North America was due to frequent fires. The fire suppression policies since the 1930s have been a significant forest disturbance.\n\nToday there is very little intact habitat in this ecoregion, with a reduction of bottomland hardwood forests by 70–95%, and only 0.02 percent of the original oak savannas remain. Although much of the area is forested, these forests tend to be highly fragmented and significantly altered by development, agriculture, and fire suppression. The forests are dominated primarily by oak and hickory species, but succession has filled the understory with maples and yellow poplar and blocking oak regeneration. In some areas, habitat is threatened by urbanization and invasive species such as non-native privet, honeysuckle, garlic mustard and kudzu.\n\nSignificant natural areas in the ecoregion include: Mammoth Cave National Park; the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area of Tennessee and Kentucky; Hoosier National Forest and Yellowwood State Forest in southern Indiana; the Edge of Appalachia Preserve in Ohio; and the Shawnee Hills in southern Illinois.\n\n\n"}

This proposal would divide the world into \"fuel supplier nations,\" which supply enriched uranium fuel and take back spent fuel, and \"user nations,\" which operate nuclear power plants.\n\nAs GNEP the proposal proved controversial in the United States and internationally. The U.S. Congress provided far less funding for GNEP than President George W. Bush requested. U.S. arms control organizations criticized the proposal to resume reprocessing as costly and increasing proliferation risks. Some countries and analysts criticized the GNEP proposal for discriminating between countries as nuclear fuel cycle \"haves\" and \"have-nots.\" In April 2009 the U.S. Department of Energy announced the cancellation of the U.S. domestic component of GNEP.\n\nIn 2010, the GNEP was renamed the International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation. IFNEC is now an international partnership with 25 partner countries, 28 observer and candidate partner countries, and three international organization observers. The international organization observers are: the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Generation IV International Forum, and the European Commission. IFNEC operates by consensus among its partners based on an agreed GNEP Statement of Mission.\n\nThe GNEP proposal began as part of the Advanced Energy Initiative announced by President Bush in his 2006 State of the Union address.\n\nIn announcing the GNEP Proposal, the U.S. Department of Energy said:\n\nAs a research and development program, GNEP is an outgrowth of the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative\n\nIn April 2009 the U.S. Department of Energy announced the cancellation of the U.S. domestic component of GNEP, and in June 2009 announced that it is no longer pursuing domestic commercial reprocessing and had largely halted the domestic GNEP programme. Research would continue on proliferation-resistant fuel cycles and waste management.\n\nThe United States has established a number of cooperative arrangements to pursue technical cooperation on this proposal. On February 16, 2006 the United States, France and Japan signed an \"arrangement\" to research and develop sodium-cooled fast reactors in support of the GNEP. The United States has established \"action plans\" for collaboration with Russia, Japan and China.\n\nOn September 16, 2007, 16 countries officially became GNEP Partners by signing the GNEP Statement of Principles. These countries were:\n\nSince then, nine additional countries have joined:\n\nSeventeen countries have been invited to join GNEP as partners but have not been willing to sign the Statement of Principles and have participated as observers. These include South Africa, although South African Minerals and Energy Minister Buyelwa Sonjica stated that \"Exporting uranium only to get it back refined, instead of enriching it in South Africa, would be 'in conflict with our national policy.'\" 25 additional countries have been invited to join GNEP at the October 1, 2008 GNEP Ministerial in Paris, France.\n\nIn 2007 a large number of U.S. nuclear arms control organizations sent a joint letter to Congress requesting that GNEP funding be terminated on the grounds that it undermined U.S. nuclear proliferation policy, would cost over $100 billion, and did not solve the nuclear waste problem.\n\nIn 2008 Congress allocated less than half of the requested funds, supporting GNEP research but not technology demonstration projects. The Congressional Budget Office assessed that reprocessing spent nuclear fuel would cost considerably more than disposal in a long-term repository.\n\nSome states do not approve of the GNEP philosophy that partitions the world between a few fuel-cycle states and a larger number of receiver states, reflecting the distinctions in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. They are concerned that their nuclear fuel assurance could in the future be subject to external political pressure. They also believe it creates an unfortunate incentive on states to develop enrichment or reprocessing technology now, to position themselves to become one of the future fuel-cycle states.\n\nSteve Kidd, Head of Strategy & Research at the World Nuclear Association, has explained:\n\nAn alternative view of GNEP may see it as somewhat discriminatory and potentially anti-competitive. By restricting parts of the fuel cycle to particular countries, albeit with fair rights of access to nuclear materials, there is a risk of maintaining or even reinforcing the existing NPT arrangements that have always upset certain nations, notably India and Pakistan. Similarly, by maintaining a market stranglehold on, for example, enrichment facilities in the existing countries, it can be argued that the market will be uncompetitive and lead to excessive profits being achieved by those who are so favoured.\nAnother criticism is that GNEP seeks to deploy proliferation-prone reprocessing technology for commercial reasons, and to bypass the continued delays with the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, while erroneously claiming to enhance global nuclear security.\n\n\n"}

If evaporation at the surface of a lake, plus the water losses through underground infiltration and plant evapotranspiration are high enough to account for all precipitation water collected by the lake, then the lake becomes endorheic, closed, or internally drained. This situation prevails until the water balance changes again and the lake overburdens the limits of its basin or until the lake capture occurs. Opening the drainage of an endorheic lacustrine basin by fluvial erosion generally implies a lake capture.\n\nLake captures are therefore very sensitive to the preexisting topography as well as to climatic and lithological factors. A climatic change towards more humid conditions can result in a higher water level in the internally drained basin, eventually causing overflow, this . In a longer time-scale, sediment colmatation of the lacustrine basin can also lead to overflow. Both can hinder the relative importance of the capture process carried out by erosion.\n\nExamples include the Late Neogen capture of the endorheic Ebro Basin (capture) or the Pleistocene Lake Bonneville.\n\n"}

One covered a gate to Hades, abode of the dead; Festus called it \"ostium Orci\", \"the gate of Orcus\". The other was used to make rain; this one may have no direct relationship with the \"Manes\", but is instead derived from the verb \"manare\", \"to flow\". \n\nThe two stones had the same name. However, the grammarian Festus held the cover to the gate of the underworld and the rainmaking stone to be two distinct stones.\n\nOne such stone covered the mundus Cereris, a pit thought to contain an entrance to the underworld. Most cities of Latium and Etruria contained a similar pit or ditch; Plutarch describes the custom of a \"mundus\" as being of Etruscan origin, and states that it was used as a place where first-fruits were deposited. The Latin word \"mundus\" meant \"world\". Festus, quoting Cato this time, explains that:\n\nThe Roman \"mundus\" was located in the Comitium. This stone was ceremonially opened three times a year, during which spirits of the blessed dead (the \"Manes\") were able to commune with the living. The three days upon which the \"mundus\" was opened were August 24, October 5, and November 8. Fruits of the harvest were offered to the dead at this time. Macrobius, quoting Varro, says of these days that: \n\nAccordingly, he reports that military and public matters were not transacted upon them, even though they were not \"dies nefasti\".\n\nThe other was used as part of a ceremony called the aquaelicium (Latin: \"calling the waters\") which sought to produce rain in times of drought. During the ceremony, the \"pontifices\" had the stone brought from its usual resting place, a temple of Mars near the Porta Capena, into the Senate. Offerings were made to Jupiter petitioning for rain, and water was ceremonially poured over the stone.\n\n"}
{"id": "50187233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50187233", "title": "Leap Manifesto", "text": "Leap Manifesto\n\nThe Leap Manifesto is a political manifesto issued by a broad coalition of Canadian authors, artists, national leaders and activists in September 2015, during the Canadian federal election campaign. Initial signatories to the Manifesto include actors Donald Sutherland, Rachel McAdams, Ellen Page, Sarah Polley, and documentary filmmaker Avi Lewis; musicians Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, and Alanis Morissette; and writers William Gibson, Naomi Klein and Michael Ondaatje, along with environmental groups and labour union members including former Canadian Union of Public Employees president Paul Moist. The document calls for a restructuring of the Canadian economy and an end to the use of fossil fuels. A resolution referring the manifesto to local riding associations for discussion was approved by delegates during the 2016 New Democratic Party (NDP) Convention.\n\nAlthough those behind the leap manifesto identify as non-partisan, they have intentionally presented the manifesto to the NDP at key times. The Leap Manifesto was first presented in September 2015 during the Canadian federal election campaign, when then NDP leader Tom Mulcair was praising the party as moderate. Leap advocates again pressed the NDP to adopt the manifesto principles at the NDP biennial policy convention held in Edmonton in April 2016, following the loss of the 2015 federal election. This has proven to divide members of the NDP party, with much controversy surrounding the Leap’s perspective towards pipelines and resource extraction energy projects. In February 2018, on the night before the biennial NDP policy convention, Leap supporters held a conference to once again urge the NDP to embrace and support the manifesto principles. In the convention, the party remained divided regarding adopting the manifesto as party policy.\n\nThere are several criticisms about the Leap Manifesto. First, although the Leap Manifesto is heavily focused on climate change and the importance of moving away from a fossil fuel-dependent economy, there is very little in the document detailing how to transition to a green economy. The document suggests that new jobs will be created in the caregiving sector, although it is argued this isn’t plausible for many small communities.\n\nAnother concern is that the Manifesto is expensive. With a goal of a \"100% Clean Economy by 2050\", the amount of technology needing to be installed and the attached prices are high. The Manifesto provides a document by Dr. Jacobson titled ‘100% Clean and Renewable Wind, Water, and Sunlight (WWS) All-Sector Energy Roadmaps for 139 Countries of the World’ to support its cause. The implementation of renewable energy systems is a lengthy and expensive process, which is argued to be unachievable.\n\nAnother criticism is that there are many questions attached to the manifesto, yet there are not as many answers. The manifesto is much harder on resource extraction than it is on the inequalities brought about by a capitalist system. The manifesto mentions new jobs produced in caregiving sectors, although this may not be suitable for all communities across Canada. Former New Democrat and co-founder of The Waffle, James Laxer, described the manifesto as \"a document for elites and not the majority of Canadians\" due to its focus on divestment from resource extraction rather than addressing wage and wealth inequality.\n\n"}

She showed an early interest in gardening. \n\nIn 1902, she married architect Walter Robb Wilder, and the couple moved to Pomona, New York, where she transformed the rural property (known as Balderbrae), adding pathways, a pair of half-moon fountains, a grape arbor, terraces, flowering trees, a walled garden, and an herb bed. Later, they moved a bit further south to the village of Bronxville, where she designed Station Plaza and founded a local Working Gardeners Club (1925). She designed residential gardens across the county; her philosophy, influenced by the aesthetic of British gardener Gertrude Jekyll, was to create something \"formal in design but most informal in execution\".\n\nWilder wrote ten books about her experiences as a gardener that were popular for offering clear, explicit advice rather than flowery nature writing. She also wrote for newspapers and gardening and shelter magazines such as \"Horticulture\", \"House & Garden\", and the \"New York Times\". In particular, she took up the challenge of adapting Jekyll's aesthetic—developed for a substantially different climate and range of plant species—to the needs of American gardeners. The title of her second book, \"Colour in My Garden\", deliberately echoes Jekyll's influential 1908 book \"Colour in the Flower Garden\".\n\nWilder's \"socio-botanical commentaries\"—as author Michael Pollan termed them—captured the spirit of a moment in America when suburban gardening and its attendant forms of landscape design were on the rise and an older, more formal style of large estate garden was in decline. A \"New York Times\" editor called her a Romantic, but one \"with a strong vein of scientific curiosity that she exercised on a domestic scale.” Another \"New York Times\" editor, after noting that she was conversant with both classic British and recent American horticultural literature, praised her for the sharpness of her field observations. Her books—especially \"Colour in My Garden\"—are now considered classics, and in 2001 some were reissued as a four-volume collection, \"The Louise Beebe Wilder Gardener’s Library: Four Classic Books by America’s Greatest Garden Writer\".\n\nWilder also served on the board of the New York Botanical Garden. \n\nShe was honored with the Garden Club of America's Gold Medal for Horticultural Achievement in 1937.\nWalter committed suicide in 1934, and Wilder herself died April 20, 1938.\n\n"}

Nappes form in compressional tectonic settings like continental collision zones or on the overriding plate in active subduction zones. Nappes form when a mass of rock is forced (or \"thrust\") over another rock mass, typically on a low angle fault plane. The resulting structure may include large-scale recumbent folds, shearing along the fault plane, imbricate thrust stacks, fensters and klippe.\n\nThe term stems from the French word for \"tablecloth\" in allusion to a rumpled tablecloth being pushed across a table.\n\nNappes or nappe belts are a major feature of the European Alps, Carpathians and Balkans. Since the 19th century many geologists have uncovered areas with large-scale overthrusts. Some of these were substantiated with paleontological evidence. The concept was developed by Marcel Alexandre Bertrand, who unraveled the complex tectonic history of the Alps and identified the feature as \"nappe de charriage\". He reinterpreted earlier studies by Arnold Escher von der Linth and Albert Heim in the Glarus Alps. His work in Switzerland influenced Escher and Maurice Lugeon. Several years later, nappe structure was investigated in northwestern Scotland by Charles Lapworth. Lugeon later transferred the ideas of nappes to the Carpathians.\n\n\"Nappe\" can be qualified in a number of ways to indicate various features of a formation. The frontal part in the direction of movement, is called \"the leading edge\" of a nappe; numerous folds and secondary thrusts and duplexes are common features here and are sometimes called \"digitations\". The surface of a thrust fault which caused movement of a nappe is called a \"decollement\", \"detachment plane\" or sole of thrust. The \"root area\" is an area where the nappe is completely separated from its substratum. It is often compressed and reduced, even underthrust below the surrounding tectonic units, resulting in a specific structure called a \"suture\". A nappe whose root area is unknown, is called a \"rootless nappe\".\n\nAreas with a nappe structure often contain two types of geological features:\n\n\nAccording to petrographical composition, two basic types of nappes are known:\n\n\nNappes are generally considered as compressional structures, however some exceptions could be found especially among the gravitational slides along low angle faults. Gravitational forces could be even important in certain cases during emplacement of compressional thrusts. The movement of huge masses of rock may be influenced by several forces, forces that may act together or sequentially.\n\nAt shallower depths, low pressures and temperatures can't cause the plastic and viscous behavior of solid rock necessary to move along low angle faults. It is considered that such characteristics may be achieved at significantly less extreme conditions in the clayey rocks or evaporites, which can then act as tectonic lubricants. The process, which significantly reduces the frictional resistance, is the fluid overpressure, which acts against the normal pressure, thereby reducing high lithostatic pressures and allowing fracturation, cataclasis and formation of tectonic breccia or fault gouge that could act as a decollement plane. Evaporites are also often related the decollement and thrust planes. Evaporites are strongly prone to shear deformation and therefore preferred planes of detachment.\n\nBehavior of thrust sheets is currently explained on the model of the orogenic wedge, which is dependent on the internal wedge taper θ. Gravitational sliding is movement generated by the movement down an inclined plane under the action of gravity. Gravitational spreading, possibly accompanied by an initial phase of diapirism, is generated by large heat flow that causes detachment in a hinterland. Other mechanisms, such as push from behind, action of tangential compressive forces, and shortening of the basement, are essentially variations of the previous mechanisms.\n"}

{"id": "98555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98555", "title": "Oceanus Procellarum", "text": "Oceanus Procellarum\n\nOceanus Procellarum (; Latin for \"Ocean of Storms\") is a vast lunar mare on the western edge of the near side of the Moon. It is the only one of the lunar maria to be called an \"Oceanus\" (ocean), due to its size: Oceanus Procellarum is the largest of the maria, stretching more than across its north-south axis and covering roughly .\n\nLike all lunar maria, Oceanus Procellarum was formed by ancient basaltic flood volcanic eruptions that covered the region in a thick, nearly flat layer of solidified magma. Unlike the other lunar maria, however, Oceanus Procellarum may or may not be contained within a single well-defined impact basin. Around its edges lie many minor bays and seas, including Mare Nubium and Mare Humorum to the south. To the northeast, Oceanus Procellarum is separated from Mare Imbrium by the Carpathian Mountains. On its north-west edge lies the 32 km wide Aristarchus ray crater, which is considered as the brightest feature on the Near side of the Moon. Also, the more-prominent ray-crater Copernicus lies within the eastern edge of the mare, distinctly with its bright ray materials sprawling over the darker material. On the northern edge of Oceanus Procellarum lies Sinus Roris.\n\nThere are several hypotheses about the origin of Oceanus Procellarum and a related asymmetry between the near and far sides of the Moon. One of the most likely is that Procellarum was a result of an ancient giant impact on the near side of the Moon. The size of the impact basin has been estimated to be more than 3,000 kilometers, which would make it one of the largest craters in the Solar System. \nThe impact likely happened very early in the Moon's history: at the time when magma ocean still existed or just ceased to exist. It deposited 5–30 km of crustal material on the far side forming highlands. If this is the case, all impact related structures such as crater rim, central peak etc. have been obliterated by later impacts and volcanism. One piece of evidence in support of this hypothesis is concentration of incompatible elements (KREEP) and low calcium pyroxene around Oceanus Procellarum.\n\nProcellarum may have also been formed by spatially inhomogeneous heating during the Moon's formation. The GRAIL mission, which mapped the gravity gradients of the moon, found square formations resembling rift valleys surrounding the region beneath the lava plains, suggesting the basin was formed by heating and cooling of the lunar surface by internal processes rather than by an impact, which would have left a round crater.\n\nOther hypotheses include a late accretion of a companion Moon on the far side. The latter postulates that in addition to the present Moon, another smaller (about 1,200 km in diameter) moon was formed from debris of the giant impact. After a few tens of millions of years it collided with the Moon and due to a small collisional velocity simply piled up on one side of the Moon forming what is now known as far side highlands.\n\nThe robotic lunar probes Luna 9, Luna 13, Surveyor 1 and Surveyor 3 landed in Oceanus Procellarum. Luna 9 landed southwest of Galilaei crater in 1966. Luna 13 landed southeast of Seleucus crater, later in 1966. Surveyor 1 landed north of Flamsteed crater (within the larger Flamsteed P) in 1966, and Surveyor 3 landed in 1967. \n\nDuring the Apollo program, flight operations planners were concerned about having the optimum lighting conditions at the landing site, hence the alternative target sites moved progressively westward, following the terminator. A delay of two days for weather or equipment reasons would have sent Apollo 11 to Sinus Medii (designated ALS3) instead of ALS2—Mare Tranquillitatis; another two-day delay would have resulted in ALS5, a site in Oceanus Procellarum, being targeted.\n\nThe manned Apollo 12 mission landed in Oceanus Procellarum, with astronauts Pete Conrad and Alan Bean on board. Their landing site, within of Surveyor 3, has become known as Mare Cognitum.\n"}

Oil extracted from fields controlled by ISIL( Islamic State Of Iraq And The Levant ) in Syria and Iraq were mainly distributed within most its territory, but also smuggled to surrounding states at below market prices.\n\nWhile oil products, petrol and mazout, were the backbone of the economy of ISIL-controlled areas with mazout being the power source for generators for electricity, not all energy production was provided by oil. Hydroelectric power plants had been captured in northern Syria, so the Tabqa Dam, the Baath Dam, and, from 2012-2015, the Tishrin Dam. Some electric power has been sold back to the Syrian government. The Syrian government was also reported to send technicians to support and maintain ISIL-controlled gas power plants, and, in return, received electricity.\n\nOil production within ISIL developed over time reaching a peak by 2014. Due to military interventions, ISIL subsequently lost much of its territory to continue oil production on a larger scale in Syria and Iraq, yet continues to produce oil from those oil fields it controls.\n\nEstimates of the income ISIL derived from its oil operations vary. In 2014, Dubai-based energy analysts put the combined oil revenue from ISIL's Iraqi-Syrian production as high as US$3 million per day. An estimate from October 2015 indicated the production to be about 34,000-40,000 bpd that was sold at US$20–45 at the wellhead generating an income of US$1.5 million per day. Another 2015 estimate sets the monthly income as high as US$40 million. Various other reports indicated in 2015 that ISIS obtained 1.1 to 1.5 million dollars a day from selling of oil and its products. At the end of 2015 increased air strikes targeting oil production and distribution started to affect oil operations. Thus an estimate for March 2016 was a monthly income of about US$20 million.\n\nIn 2013 ISIL moved operations from the north of Syria to its east in recognition of the importance of the oil fields for its operations, among the fields in the Deir Ezzor region such as the al-Omar, the Deiro and the al-Tanak fields, and outside this region, the al-Jabsah fields and al Tabqa fields. Deir Ezzor oil field is located in Deir ez-Zor province that produces 34,000-40,000 barrels a day. al-Omar and al-Tanak are top producing and beneficial oil fields. Quality of Petroleum determined price of each barrel sold at the wellhead 25 to 45 dollars.\n\nIn Iraq ISIL conquered the Ajil and Allas oil fields in northern Iraq during the Mosul campaign in 2014. These areas were later recaptured by the Iraq army. Also, in north of Iraq, the Qayyarah oil field was controlled by ISIS producing 8,000 barrels a day of heavy crude oil. Ajil in north of Tikrit and Himiran were important ISIS-controlled oil fields in Iraq. ISIL had been able recruit engineers and expert personnel to manage the oil production sites. Oil production was centrally controlled by the top leadership. Until his death in May 2015, Abu Sayyaf had been the \"emir\" or top official for oil production controlling oil production from 200-plus wells.\n\nAt the end of September 2016, Rudaw (a Kurdish media organization) reported that ISIL no longer controlled any Iraqi oil after Shargat and Qayyarah had been recaptured by the Iraqi army.\n\nISIL made its money at the pump where it sold its products to usually independent traders from Syria and Iraq. In addition, ISIL taxed oil in the distribution system. It had been estimated that there was a fleet of about 1,000 delivery trucks. Oil was brought to local refineries to produce petrol and mazout. Many \"refineries\" were just rudimentary furnaces spread along the roadsides. Most of these oil products were sold within ISIL-controlled areas in Syria and Iraq by traders. Rebel-held areas in northern Syria were also receiving oil from ISIL.\n\nISIS had several markets in Iraqi and Syrian towns and provinces. Some of the largest ISIS oil market were Manbij, Al-Bab, and Al-Qa'im.\n\nOil smuggling to areas outside of Syria was profitable bringing contraband to Turkey, Jordan, Iraq and Iran. A network to smuggle oil had been in place since at least the 1990s when Saddam Hussein evaded sanctions and smuggled oil out of Iraq. A report by \"The Guardian\" in 2014 suggested that corruption and bribery facilitated transport of oil from ISIL-controlled areas into surrounding areas.\n\nIn November 2015 the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev indicated to have information that some Turkish officials had a \"direct financial interest\" in the oil trade with ISIL, an assertion rejected by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Vladimir Putin indicated that the extent of the oil smuggling had reached commercial-scale with trucks operating day and night as a \"living oil pipe\". Several independent analysts, on the other hand, argued that the allegations of Moscow did not carry any weight. Officials from the US responded that in their view only a small amount of oil is smuggled into Turkey and that this is economically insignificant. According to Adam Szubin, acting U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, most of the oil that leaves ISIL-controlled areas is going to places that are under control of the Syrian government.\n\nIn January 2016 the Israeli Defence minister alleged that Turkey was buying oil from ISIS In March 2016, an RT documentary presented documents left by retreating ISIL operatives and witness reports that also suggested a link between ISIL's oil production and support by Turkey that, in turn, was benefiting from cheap oil. In response to the allegations, Serko Cevdet, the head of the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government's (KRG) energy commission, told the Turkish media that the trucks in the footage actually belonged to the Kurds and there was no way that ISIL could have transported them through a Kurdish controlled territory due to the ongoing conflict between the Kurds and ISIL. Fawaz Gerges from the London School of Economics and Political Science argued that the claims about Turkey's involvement in ISIL oil trade were conspiracy theories. In 2016 WikiLeaks published more than 57,000 emails from 2010 to 2016 reportedly obtained by the hacktivist group Redhack that linked ISIL with Turkey's Minister of Oil Berat Albayrak, Tayyip Erdogan's son-in-law, by allegedly \"proving his connection to ISIS operation smuggling oil into Turkey,\" even years after Turkey banned most oil imports from ISIL. Commenting on the allegations, John R. Bass, the US Ambassador to Turkey, told the press that the claims about the Turkish government's involvement in ISIL oil trade were unfounded, citing the official apology issued by the CIA with regards to the allegations in 2014.\n\nArab media accused Israel of being a major buyer of oil smuggled out of the ISIL-held Syrian and Iraqi territories. According to this accusation, oil was smuggled to Zakhu where Israeli and Turkish dealers would determine the price, the oil was then sent as Kurdish oil to Silopi, Turkey, and transported to Turkish ports (such as Ceyhan) and shipped to Israel.\n\nISIL transferred oil in different ways out of its territory. Oil could be trucked to Turkey, refined there and be used in Turkey or transported to tankers at the ports of Ceyhan or Dortyol. Oil could also be sold to middlemen in northern Iraq who then would mix it with legitimate oil that enter through one of many feeders the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline. At the end of the pipeline it would have been difficult to determine if some ISIS oil was present in the mix that was supposed to come from Kurdish fields.\n\nAnother way of smuggling was the transport of oil to Jordan. Smugglers went south through Al Anbar province towards Jordan. In fact, Al Anbar was known as a major smuggling hub in Iraq. Sami Khalaf, an oil smuggler and former Iraqi intelligence officer under Saddam Hussein, said that: \"We buy an oil tanker carrying around 26 to 28 tonnes [of oil] for $4,200. We sell it in Jordan for $15,000. Each smuggler takes around eight tankers a week.\" Also, he added: \"smugglers typically paid corrupt border officials $650 to pass through each checkpoint.\"\n\nIn January 2017, US officials indicated that revenues from oil and gas sold to President Bashar al-Assad's government had become the main revenue for ISIL. Trucks that previously delivered oil to Turkey and Iraq had been re-directed to territory controlled by Assad.\n\nWhile degrading oil operations is an obvious target for military operations, the United States was reported to have refrained from using this approach out of concerns for civilian casualties and destabilizing the life of a ten million population that depended on oil from ISIL production. Also, rebel-held areas supported by the U.S. depended on ISIL oil for sustenance. Further, direct hits on oil fields could lead to a natural disaster and make future use difficult.\nWhile Bloomberg Business reported in the fall of 2014 that U.S. airstrikes had significantly reduced ISIL oil business, the Financial Times reported in October 2015 that only 196 of 10,600 air strikes by U.S. led coalition forces were conducted against oil infrastructure since August 2014 and that ISIL continued a very profitable oil business generating about $1.5 million per day. In late 2015 a U.S. spokesman conceded that the effectiveness of past air strikes against oil-related targets had been grossly overestimated while the importance of oil production as a revenue maker had been underestimated.\n\nWhen in May 2015 U.S. forces conducted a raid that killed Abu Sayyaf, detailed records of the oil operation of ISIL were obtained. The recognition of the significance of oil for ISIL and insights into its operations led to a new focus in air strikes. Thus, on 21 October 2015 the U.S. launched operation \"Operation Tidal Wave II\" in reference to Operation Tidal Wave in World War II in a renewed effort to reduce the ability of ISIL to fund itself through oil production.\n\nIn the fall of 2015 Russia established Khmeimim air base in Syria. After the November 2015 Paris attacks the French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian indicated that degradation of oil production as the \"lifeblood\" of ISIL needed to be at the center of military strategy. In an effort to reduce revenue for ISIL more oil tankers were destroyed later in the month. Prior to targeted air raids, smuggling trucks had sometimes waited for weeks in queues near the oil fields to buy crude. The defense ministry of Moscow released satellite images showing columns of waiting trucks near the border of Turkey. After Russian air attacks against smuggling trucks, ISIS changed its system to prevent the formation of long queues.\n\nA report at the end of December 2015 indicated that ISIL was starting to have financial problems due to lower oil revenues resulting in lower salaries for foreign fighters and higher prices for electricity and oil in Raqqa. A shortage of oil within ISIL-controlled territories had resulted in energy shortages with less electricity and water becoming available. Also, smuggling of oil had decreased as it had become more dangerous and less lucrative.\n\nA 2016 analysis of ISIL's response to the air strikes on the oil infrastructure indicated the development of multiple tiny makeshift refineries in oil fields under their control. These micro-refineries consisted of a pit to store crude and a portable metal furnace to distill it into fuel. The operation was dirty and relatively inefficient but harder to destroy. According to Stratfor income from oil had declined to about $20 million a month (March 2016).\n\nBelow table shows oil production amount and price in important ISIS-controlled oil fields (December 2015). \n"}

It is one of two main branches of soil science, the other being edaphology. Pedology deals with pedogenesis, soil morphology, and soil classification, while edaphology studies the way soils influence plants, fungi, and other living things.\n\nSoil is not only a support for vegetation, but it is also the pedosphere, the locus of numerous interactions between climate (water, air, temperature), soil life (micro-organisms, plants, animals) and its residues, the mineral material of the original and added rock, and its position in the landscape. During its formation and genesis, the soil profile slowly deepens and develops characteristic layers, called 'horizons', while a steady state balance is approached.\n\nSoil users (such as agronomists) showed initially little concern in the dynamics of soil. They saw it as medium whose chemical, physical and biological properties were useful for the services of agronomic productivity. On the other hand, pedologists and geologists did not initially focus on the agronomic applications of the soil characteristics (edaphic properties) but upon its relation to the nature and history of landscapes. Today, there is an integration of the two disciplinary approaches as part of landscape and environmental sciences.\n\nPedologists are now also interested in the practical applications of a good understanding of pedogenesis processes (the evolution and functioning of soils), like interpreting its environmental history and predicting consequences of changes in land use, while agronomists understand that the cultivated soil is a complex medium, often resulting from several thousands of years of evolution. They understand that the current balance is fragile and that only a thorough knowledge of its history makes it possible to ensure its sustainable use.\n\nImportant pedological concepts include:\n\n\n"}

Key planetary consciousness events of the 20th century include the creation of the League of Nations, the signing of Kellogg-Briand Pact, the creation of the United Nations, and the creation of the Bretton Woods system. Democratic globalization advocate Abhay Kumar points to the International Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) board of directors election in 2000, which were conducted globally, as the first example of global democracy. In September 2001, Ervin László and the Dalai Lama wrote an essay titled \"Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness\", which was adopted at a meeting at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest. Its introduction begins:\n\nAndreas Bummel, CEO of the Committee for a Democratic UN, says, \"The first step into the direction of a world parliament would be the establishment of a Parliamentary Assembly at the United Nations\".\n\nAdvocacy for the idea of planetary consciousness is based on the technological advancements made by the mankind in the fields of transport and telecommunications during the 20th century and in the first decade of the 21st century. Kumar claims that these technological advancements have turned the whole planet into an interdependent economic, political and communication community. He specifically cites the invention of the Internet and the mobile phones as key technological achievements of the 20th century which brought humans into more continuous interconnected communication. He believes that these inventions will lead to a second Renaissance and global democracy, just as the Gutenberg press in 1439 led to the first Renaissance, the Age of Enlightenment, and Nation states.

{"id": "56524376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56524376", "title": "Pollen DNA barcoding", "text": "Pollen DNA barcoding\n\nPollen DNA barcoding is the process of identifying pollen donor plant species through the amplification and sequencing of specific, conserved regions of plant DNA. Being able to accurately identify pollen has a wide range of applications though it has been difficult in the past due to the limitations of microscopic identification of pollen.\n\nPollen identified using DNA barcoding involves the specific targeting of gene regions that are found in most to all plant species but have high variation between members of different species. The unique sequence of base pairs for each species within these target regions can be used as an identifying feature.\n\nThe applications of pollen DNA barcoding range from forensics, to food safety, to conservation. Each of these fields benefits from the creation of plant barcode reference libraries. These libraries range largely in size and scope of their collections as well as what target region(s) they specialize in.\n\nOne of the main challenges of identifying pollen is that it is often collected as a mixture of pollen from several species. Metabarcoding is the process of identifying the individual species DNA from a mixed DNA sample and is commonly used to catalog pollen in mixed pollen loads found on pollinating animals and in environmental DNA (also called eDNA) which is DNA extracted straight from the environment such as in soil or water samples.\n\nSome of the principle constraints of microscopic identification are the expertise and time requirements. Identifying pollen via microscopy requires a high level of expertise in the pollen characteristics of the specific plants being studied. With expertise it can still be extremely difficult to identify pollen accurately with high taxonomic resolution. The skills required to do DNA barcoding are much more common making the approach easier to adopt. Pollen DNA barcoding is a technique that has grown in popularity due to the decreased costs associated with \"next generation sequencing\" (NGS) techniques and is being continually improved in efficiency including through the use of a dual-indexing approach. Some of the other major advantages include the savings in time and resources compared to microscopic identification. Identifying pollen is time consuming involving spreading pollen on a slide, staining the pollen to improve visibility, then focusing in on individual pollen grains and identifying them based on size, shape, as well as the shape and number of pores. If a pollen reference library is not available, then pollen has to be collected from wild specimens or from herbarium specimens and is then added to a pollen reference library.\n\nRare plants visited by some pollinators can be difficult to determine, by using pollen DNA barcoding researchers can uncover \"invisible\" interactions between plants and pollinators.\n\nThere are many challenges when it comes to genetic barcoding of pollen. The amplification process of DNA can mean that even small pieces of plant DNA can be detected included those from contaminants to a sample. Strict procedures to prevent contamination are important and can be facilitated by the hardiness of the pollen coat allowing the pollen to be washed of contaminants without damaging the internal pollen DNA.\n\nDNA barcode reference libraries are still being built and standardized target regions are being gradually adopted. These challenges are likely due to the newness of DNA barcoding and will likely improve with the wider adoption of DNA barcoding as a tool used by taxonomists.\n\nDetermining the amount of each contributor to a mixed pollen load can be difficult to determine through the use of DNA barcoding. However, scientists have been able to compare pollen amounts via rank order.\n\nInnovations in automated microscopy and imagining software offer one potential alternative in the identification of pollen. Through the use of pattern-recognition software, researchers have developed software that can characterize microscopic pollen images based on texture analyzes.\n\nThere have been several different regions of plant DNA that have been used as targets for genetic barcoding including rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, ITS1 and ITS2. A combination of rbcL and matK has been recommended for use in plant DNA barcoding. It has been found that trnL is better for degraded DNA and ITS1 is better for differentiating species within a genus.\n\nBeing able to identify pollen is especially important in the study of pollination networks which are made up of all the interactions between plants and the animals that facilitate their pollination. Identifying the pollen carried on insects helps scientists understand what plants are being visited by which insects. Insects can also have homologous features making them difficult to identify and are themselves sometimes identified through genetic barcoding (usually of the CO1 region). Every insect that visits a flower isn’t necessarily a pollinator. Many lack features such as hairs allowing them to carry pollen while others avoid the pollen-laden anthers to steal nectar. Pollination networks are made more accurate by including what pollen is being carried by which insects. Some scientists argue that pollination effectiveness (PE), which is measured by studying the germination rates of seeds produced from flowers visited only once by a single animal, is the best way to determine which animals are important pollinators though other scientists have used DNA barcoding to determine the genetic origin of pollen found on insects and have argued that this in conjunction with other traits is a good indication of pollination effectiveness. By studying the composition and structure of pollination networks, conservationists can understand the stability of a pollination network and identify which species are most important and which are at most risk to perturbation leading to pollinator declines.\n\nAnother advantage of pollen DNA barcoding is that is can be used to determine the source of pollen found on insect museum specimens, these records of insect-plant interactions can then be compared to modern-day interactions to see how pollination networks have changed with time due to global warming, land use change, and other factors.\n\nBeing accurately able to identify pollen found on evidence helps forensic investigators identify which regions evidence originated from based on the plants that are endemic to those regions. In addition to this: atmospheric pollen originating from illegal cannabis farms were successfully detected by scientists which in the future could allow law enforcement officials to narrow down the search areas for illegal farms.\n\nDue to the hardy structure of pollen which has evolved to survive being transported sometimes great distances while keeping the internal genetic information intact, the origin of pollen found mixed in ancient substrates can often be determined through DNA barcoding.\n\nHoneybees carry pollen as well as the nectar used in their production of honey. For food quality and safety concerns it is important to understand the plant providence of human-consumed bee products including honey, royal jelly, and pollen pellets. Investigators can test which plants honeybees foraged on and thus the origin of the nectar used in honey by collecting pollen packets from honeybees' corbicular loads and identify the pollen via DNA metabarcoding.\n"}

Two classes of post-tropical cyclones are:\n\nNot all systems fall into the above two classes. According to the guideline, a system without frontal characteristics but with maximum winds above 34 knots may not be designated as a remnant low. It should be merely described as post-tropical. A few examples falling into this grey area are listed below.\nHowever, there has been an occasion that the United States National Hurricane Center violated the definition and designated Calvin (2011) as a 35-knot remnant low.\n\nAlso, if a tropical cyclone degenerates into a tropical wave or trough, then it does not qualify as a post-tropical cyclone. It would be referred as the \"remnants of (tropical cyclone name)\".\n\nMétéo-France classifies systems in the South-West Indian Ocean undergoing an extratropical transition or losing tropical characteristics as “post-tropical depressions”, since the 2012–13 cyclone season. They would be re-classified as extratropical depressions after completing the process.\n\nA post-tropical cyclone is formed when the typical characteristics of a tropical cyclone are replaced with those of extratropical cyclones, otherwise known as extratropical transition. After the initial formation, a post-tropical cyclone has the potential to gain strength and intensity by forming an extratropical storm. If a post-tropical cyclone does become an extratropical storm, it will eventually decay through the process of occlusion.\n\nThe re-intensification of a post-tropical cyclone can cause dangerous conditions in North Atlantic shipping routes with high seas and winds comparable to those of hurricanes.\n\nThe terminology was initiated by Canadian Hurricane Centre in 1998 during Tropical Storm Bonnie. In 2008, the National Hurricane Center used this term for Tropical Storm Laura to address the limitation of the two classes (extratropical/remnant low) mentioned above.

{"id": "15611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15611", "title": "Simon–Ehrlich wager", "text": "Simon–Ehrlich wager\n\nThe Simon-Ehrlich Wager describes a 1980 scientific wager between business professor Julian L. Simon and biologist Paul Ehrlich, betting on a mutually agreed-upon measure of resource scarcity over the decade leading up to 1990. The widely-followed contest originated in the pages of \"Social Science Quarterly\", where Simon challenged Ehrlich to put his money where his mouth was. In response to Ehrlich's published claim that \"If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000\" Simon offered to take that bet, or, more realistically, \"to stake US$10,000 ... on my belief that the cost of non-government-controlled raw materials (including grain and oil) will not rise in the long run.\"\n\nSimon challenged Ehrlich to choose any raw material he wanted and a date more than a year away, and he would wager on the inflation-adjusted prices decreasing as opposed to increasing. Ehrlich chose copper, chromium, nickel, tin, and tungsten. The bet was formalized on September 29, 1980, with September 29, 1990 as the payoff date. Ehrlich lost the bet, as all five commodities that were bet on declined in price from 1980 through 1990, the wager period.\n\nIn 1968, Ehrlich published \"The Population Bomb\", which argued that mankind was facing a demographic catastrophe with the rate of population growth quickly outstripping growth in the supply of food and resources. Simon was highly skeptical of such claims, so proposed a wager, telling Ehrlich to select any raw material he wanted and select \"any date more than a year away,\" and Simon would bet that the commodity's price on that date would be lower than what it was at the time of the wager.\n\nEhrlich and his colleagues picked five metals that they thought would undergo big price increases: chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten. Then, on paper, they bought $200 worth of each, for a total bet of $1,000, using the prices on September 29, 1980, as an index. They designated September 29, 1990, 10 years hence, as the payoff date. If the inflation-adjusted prices of the various metals rose in the interim, Simon would pay Ehrlich the combined difference. If the prices fell, Ehrlich et al. would pay Simon.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1990, the world's population grew by more than 800 million, the largest increase in one decade in all of history. But by September 1990, the price of each of Ehrlich's selected metals had fallen. Chromium, which had sold for $3.90 a pound in 1980, was down to $3.70 in 1990. Tin, which was $8.72 a pound in 1980, was down to $3.88 a decade later.\n\nAs a result, in October 1990, Paul Ehrlich mailed Julian Simon a check for $576.07 to settle the wager in Simon's favor.\n\nJulian Simon won because the price of three of the five metals went down in nominal terms and all five of the metals fell in price in inflation-adjusted terms, with both tin and tungsten falling by more than half. In his book \"Betrayal of Science and Reason\", Ehrlich wrote that Simon \"[asserted] that humanity would never run out of anything\". Ehrlich added that he and fellow scientists viewed renewable resources as more important indicators of the state of planet Earth, but that he decided to go along with the bet anyway. Afterward, Simon offered to raise the wager to $20,000 and to use any resources at any time that Ehrlich preferred. Ehrlich countered with a challenge to bet that temperatures would increase in the future. The two were unable to reach an agreement on the terms of a second wager before Simon died.\n\nEhrlich could have won if the bet had been for a different ten-year period. Ehrlich wrote that the five metals in question had increased in price between the years 1950 to 1975. Asset manager Jeremy Grantham wrote that if the Simon–Ehrlich wager had been for a longer period (from 1980 to 2011), then Simon would have lost on four of the five metals. He also noted that if the wager had been expanded to \"all of the most important commodities,\" instead of just five metals, over that longer period of 1980 to 2011, then Simon would have lost \"by a lot.\" Economist Mark J. Perry noted that for an even longer period of time, from 1934 to 2013, the inflation-adjusted price of the Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index showed \"an overall significant downward trend\" and concluded that Simon was \"more right than lucky\". Economist Tim Worstall wrote that \"The end result of all of this is that yes, it is true that Ehrlich could have, would have, won the bet depending upon the starting date. ... But the long term trend for metals at least is downwards.\"\n\nThe price of raw and other natural commodities such as oil, gold, and uranium have risen substantially in recent years, due to increased demand from China, India, and other industrializing countries. However, Simon has argued that this price increase is not necessarily contrary to his cornucopian theory. Ehrlich has dismissed the bet as a side issue and stated that the main worry is environmental problems like the ozone hole, acid rain, and global warming.\n\nUnderstanding that Simon wanted to bet again, Ehrlich and climatologist Stephen Schneider counter-offered, challenging Simon to bet on 15 current trends, betting $1000 that each will get worse (as in the previous wager) over a ten-year future period.\n\nThe trends they bet would continue to worsen were:\n\nSimon declined Ehrlich and Schneider's offer to bet, and used the following analogy to explain why he did so:\n\nIn his 1981 book \"The Ultimate Resource\", Simon noted that not all decreases in resources or increases in unwanted effects correspond to overall decreases in human wellbeing. Hence there can be an \"optimal level of pollution\" which accepts some increases in certain kinds of pollution in a way that increases overall wellbeing, while acknowledging that any increase in pollution is nevertheless a cost which must be considered in any such calculation (p.143). Some of the trends listed above are actually predicted by Simon's theory of resource development, and do not in themselves even count as costs (as pollution does). E.g., he pointed out that due to increased efficiency, the amount of cropland required and actually used to grow food for each person has decreased over time and is likely to continue to do so (p.5). The same might potentially be true of decreased reliance on firewood in developing countries, and per capita use of specific food sources like rice, wheat, and fish, if economic development makes a diverse range of alternative foods available. Some have also proven false, e.g., the amount of ozone in the lower atmosphere has decreased from 1994 to 2004.\n\nIn 1996, Simon bet $1000 with David South, professor of the Auburn University School of Forestry, that the inflation-adjusted price of timber would decrease in the following five years. Simon paid out early on the bet in 1997 (before his death in 1998) based on his expectation that prices would remain above 1996 levels (which they did).\n\nIn 1999, when \"The Economist\" headlined an article entitled, \"$5 a barrel oil soon?\" and with oil trading in the $12/barrel range, David South offered $1000 to any economist who would bet with him that the price of oil would be greater than $12/barrel in 2010. No economist took him up on the offer. However, in October 2000, Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi, an economist with The University of the West Indies, bet $1000 with David South that the inflation-adjusted price of oil would decrease to an inflation-adjusted price of $25 by 2010 (down from what was then $30/barrel). Madjd-Sadjadi paid South an inflation-adjusted $1,242 in January 2010. The price of oil at the time was $81/barrel.\n\n\n\n"}

SNL records acoustic noise generated by fluid or gas flow through the reservoir or leaks in downhole well components.\n\nNoise logging tools have been used in the petroleum industry for several decades. As far back as 1955, an acoustic detector was proposed for use in well integrity analysis to identify casing holes. In this class of problems, the efficiency of noise logging was comparable to that of temperature surveys. In 1973, McKinley presented his technique for passive noise logging in which signals were recorded in several, e.g. three or four, frequency ranges at every measurement depth. This method, allowing quantitative and qualitative data interpretation, became common across the petroleum industry.\n\nOver many years, downhole noise logging tools proved effective in inflow and injectivity profiling of operating wells, leak detection, location of cross-flows behind casing, and even in determining reservoir fluid compositions. Robinson (1974) described how noise logging can be used to determine effective reservoir thickness.\n\nThe theory of sound generation by turbulent flow of fluid or gas through a single channel has been well elaborated by many authors, while the generation of acoustic oscillations by fluid flow through porous reservoirs is still poorly understood. Various physical models have been proposed, including the mechanism of sound generation by transient pulsing of the fluid flowing through pores with randomly varying properties (Zaslavsky, 2005). This paper also describes the effect of the elastic compressibility of the rock matrix on the noise signal generated by fluid flow. Especially noteworthy among the many sound generation models is the aerodynamic one based on the turbulence of fluid microflows escaping capillaries and entering wider pores (Lighthill, 1954). Generally, all of these existing models are valid and all of the above phenomena contribute to noise generation.\n\n"}

These meltwater channels can have different sizes, ranging from very small channels of a metre deep and wide to big valleys which can be up to a kilometre wide. The dimensions of these channels are regulated by several factors: water temperature, meltwater volume, debris content in the water, ice wall closure rates (governed by the ice thickness) and squeezing of fluidized sediment.\nIn the glaciological literature three forms of sub glacial melt water channels are commonly mentioned. \n\nThe first type of channel is the \"R-channel\" after Hans Röthlisberger who initiated work on water pressures in tubes under glaciers. These are semi-circular channels cut upward into the ice. The balance between channel enlargement by viscous heating and closure by ice deformation when the channels are water-filled reflects their size and water pressure. He stated the equation \nwhere formula_2 is the discharge, formula_3 and formula_4 the same as in Glens's Flow Law, formula_5 is the steady state pressure, formula_6 is the initial pressure, and formula_7 is the distance upstream. \n\nThe second type mentioned are H-channels, after Roger Hooke. These channels are similar to R channels, cut upward into the ice that tends to follow the local bed slope but are broad and flatter than R channels. Such channels form where water flows at atmospheric pressure beneath thin ice and on steep downglacier bedslopes.\nThe final type, the N-channel (after John Nye), are those incised into bedrock, perhaps suggesting long-term channel stability under some glaciers.\n"}

While it draws from fields as diverse as continuum mechanics and thermodynamics, it places a heavy emphasis on the commonalities between the topics covered. Mass, momentum, and heat transport all share a very similar mathematical framework, and the parallels between them are exploited in the study of transport phenomena to draw deep mathematical connections that often provide very useful tools in the analysis of one field that are directly derived from the others.\n\nThe fundamental analyses in all three subfields of mass, heat, and momentum transfer are often grounded in the simple principle that the sum total of the quantities being studied must be conserved by the system and its environment. Thus, the different phenomena that lead to transport are each considered individually with the knowledge that the sum of their contributions must equal zero. This principle is useful for calculating many relevant quantities. For example, in fluid mechanics, a common use of transport analysis is to determine the velocity profile of a fluid flowing through a rigid volume.\n\nTransport phenomena are ubiquitous throughout the engineering disciplines. Some of the most common examples of transport analysis in engineering are seen in the fields of process, chemical, biological, and mechanical engineering, but the subject is a fundamental component of the curriculum in all disciplines involved in any way with fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and mass transfer. It is now considered to be a part of the engineering discipline as much as thermodynamics, mechanics, and electromagnetism.\n\nTransport phenomena encompass all agents of physical change in the universe. Moreover, they are considered to be fundamental building blocks which developed the universe, and which is responsible for the success of all life on earth. However, the scope here is limited to the relationship of transport phenomena to artificial engineered systems.\n\nIn physics, transport phenomena are all irreversible processes of statistical nature stemming from the random continuous motion of molecules, mostly observed in fluids. Every aspect of transport phenomena is grounded in two primary concepts : the conservation laws, and the constitutive equations. The conservation laws, which in the context of transport phenomena are formulated as continuity equations, describe how the quantity being studied must be conserved. The constitutive equations describe how the quantity in question responds to various stimuli via transport. Prominent examples include Fourier's Law of Heat Conduction and the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe, respectively, the response of heat flux to temperature gradients and the relationship between fluid flux and the forces applied to the fluid. These equations also demonstrate the deep connection between transport phenomena and thermodynamics, a connection that explains why transport phenomena are irreversible. Almost all of these physical phenomena ultimately involve systems seeking their lowest energy state in keeping with the principle of minimum energy. As they approach this state, they tend to achieve true thermodynamic equilibrium, at which point there are no longer any driving forces in the system and transport ceases. The various aspects of such equilibrium are directly connected to a specific transport: heat transfer is the system's attempt to achieve thermal equilibrium with its environment, just as mass and momentum transport move the system towards chemical and mechanical equilibrium.\n\nExamples of transport processes include heat conduction (energy transfer), fluid flow (momentum transfer), molecular diffusion (mass transfer), radiation and electric charge transfer in semiconductors.\n\nTransport phenomena have wide application. For example, in solid state physics, the motion and interaction of electrons, holes and phonons are studied under \"transport phenomena\". Another example is in biomedical engineering, where some transport phenomena of interest are thermoregulation, perfusion, and microfluidics. In chemical engineering, transport phenomena are studied in reactor design, analysis of molecular or diffusive transport mechanisms, and metallurgy.\n\nThe transport of mass, energy, and momentum can be affected by the presence of external sources:\n\nAn important principle in the study of transport phenomena is analogy between phenomena.\n\nThere are some notable similarities in equations for momentum, energy, and mass transfer which can all be transported by diffusion, as illustrated by the following examples:\n\nThe molecular transfer equations of Newton's law for fluid momentum, Fourier's law for heat, and Fick's law for mass are very similar. One can convert from one transfer coefficient to another in order to compare all three different transport phenomena.\n\n(Definitions of these formulas are given below).\nA great deal of effort has been devoted in the literature to developing analogies among these three transport processes for turbulent transfer so as to allow prediction of one from any of the others. The Reynolds analogy assumes that the turbulent diffusivities are all equal and that the molecular diffusivities of momentum (μ/ρ) and mass (D) are negligible compared to the turbulent diffusivities. When liquids are present and/or drag is present, the analogy is not valid. Other analogies, such as von Karman's and Prandtl's, usually result in poor relations.\n\nThe most successful and most widely used analogy is the Chilton and Colburn J-factor analogy. This analogy is based on experimental data for gases and liquids in both the laminar and turbulent regimes. Although it is based on experimental data, it can be shown to satisfy the exact solution derived from laminar flow over a flat plate. All of this information is used to predict transfer of mass.\n\nIn fluid systems described in terms of temperature, matter density, and pressure, it is known that temperature differences lead to heat flows from the warmer to the colder parts of the system; similarly, pressure differences will lead to matter flow from high-pressure to low-pressure regions (a \"reciprocal relation\"). What is remarkable is the observation that, when both pressure and temperature vary, temperature differences at constant pressure can cause matter flow (as in convection) and pressure differences at constant temperature can cause heat flow. Perhaps surprisingly, the heat flow per unit of pressure difference and the density (matter) flow per unit of temperature difference are equal.\n\nThis equality was shown to be necessary by Lars Onsager using statistical mechanics as a consequence of the time reversibility of microscopic dynamics. The theory developed by Onsager is much more general than this example and capable of treating more than two thermodynamic forces at once.\n\nIn momentum transfer, the fluid is treated as a continuous distribution of matter. The study of momentum transfer, or fluid mechanics can be divided into two branches: fluid statics (fluids at rest), and fluid dynamics (fluids in motion). \nWhen a fluid is flowing in the x-direction parallel to a solid surface, the fluid has x-directed momentum, and its concentration is \"υ\"\"ρ\". By random diffusion of molecules there is an exchange of molecules in the \"z\"-direction. Hence the x-directed momentum has been transferred in the z-direction from the faster- to the slower-moving layer.\nThe equation for momentum transport is Newton's Law of Viscosity written as follows:\n\nwhere \"τ\" is the flux of x-directed momentum in the z-direction, \"ν\" is \"μ\"/\"ρ\", the momentum diffusivity, \"z\" is the distance of transport or diffusion, \"ρ\" is the density, and \"μ\" is the dynamic viscosity. Newton's Law is the simplest relationship between the flux of momentum and the velocity gradient.\n\nWhen a system contains two or more components whose concentration vary from point to point, there is a natural tendency for mass to be transferred, minimizing any concentration difference within the system. Mass Transfer in a system is governed by Fick's First Law: 'Diffusion flux from higher concentration to lower concentration is proportional to the gradient of the concentration of the substance and the diffusivity of the substance in the medium.' Mass transfer can take place due to different driving forces. Some of them are:\n\n\nThis can be compared to Fick's Law of Diffusion, for a species A in a binary mixture consisting of A and B:\n\nwhere D is the diffusivity constant.\n\nAll processes in engineering involve the transfer of energy. Some examples are the heating and cooling of process streams, phase changes, distillations, etc. The basic principle is the first law of thermodynamics which is expressed as follows for a static system:\n\nThe net flux of energy through a system equals the conductivity times the rate of change of temperature with respect to position.\n\nFor other systems that involve either turbulent flow, complex geometries or difficult boundary conditions another equation would be easier to use:\n\nwhere A is the surface area, :formula_5 is the temperature driving force, Q is the heat flow per unit time, and h is the heat transfer coefficient.\n\nWithin heat transfer, two types of convection can occur:\n\nForced convection can occur in both laminar and turbulent flow. In the situation of laminar flow in circular tubes, several dimensionless numbers are used such as Nusselt number, Reynolds number, and Prandtl. The commonly used equation is:\n\nNatural or free convection is a function of Grashof and Prandtl numbers. The complexities of free convection heat transfer make it necessary to mainly use empirical relations from experimental data.\n\nHeat transfer is analyzed in packed beds, reactors and heat exchangers.\n\n\n"}

The second son of John Woolrich (c.1791–1843) and his wife Mary Woolrich (formerly Egginton), he was baptised at St Mary's Church, Lichfield on 6 November 1820.\n\nIn August 1842 he was granted patent number 9431 for the use of a magneto-electrical machine (instead of batteries) in electroplating, and the use of gold sulphite and silver sulphite as electrolytes. He offered to sell the rights to Elkingtons for the enormous sum of £15,000; they declined, and after some heated correspondence eventually, in May 1845, agreed to pay Woolrich £100 initially and then £400 annually for the rest of the term of the patent. Woolrich later relicensed the patent himself to use in his own Magneto-Plating and Gilding Works in Great Charles Street, Birmingham, and in 1849 was listed as a \"chemist & magneto-plater & gilder\", residing at 12 James Street, just off St Paul's Square in the Jewellery Quarter.\n\nHe died at the age of 29 in early 1850, and was buried at St Bartholomew's Church, Edgbaston on 4 March 1850.\n\nThe elder John Woolrich is listed in the United Kingdom Census 1841 as a \"Chemist\", and at the time of his death on 20 April 1843 was a lecturer in chemistry at the Royal School of Medicine and Surgery in Birmingham. He had a particular interest in electrochemistry, and in February 1819 wrote a letter entitled \"On Galvanic Shocks\" to the Annals of Philosophy, pointing out an error in the editor Thomas Thomson's book \"System of Chemistry\". He was granted a number of patents for chemical processes, including one in 1836 for an improved method of producing \"carbonate of baryta\" (barium carbonate) and another in 1839 for producing \"carbonate of lead, commonly called white lead\".\n\n"}
