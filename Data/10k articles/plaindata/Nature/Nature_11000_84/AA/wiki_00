{"id": "953399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=953399", "title": "Active Denial System", "text": "Active Denial System\n\nThe Active Denial System (ADS) is a non-lethal, directed-energy weapon developed by the U.S. military, designed for area denial, perimeter security and crowd control. Informally, the weapon is also called the heat ray since it works by heating the surface of targets, such as the skin of targeted human subjects. Raytheon is currently marketing a reduced-range version of this technology. The ADS was deployed in 2010 with the United States military in the Afghanistan War, but was withdrawn without seeing combat. On August 20, 2010, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department announced its intent to use this technology on prisoners in the Pitchess Detention Center in Los Angeles, stating its intent to use it in \"operational evaluation\" in situations such as breaking up prisoner fights. The ADS is currently only a vehicle-mounted weapon, though U.S. Marines and police are both working on portable versions. ADS was developed under the sponsorship of the DoD Non-Lethal Weapons Program with the Air Force Research Laboratory as the lead agency. There are reports that Russia and China are developing their own versions of the Active Denial System.\n\nThe ADS works by firing a high-powered beam of 95 GHz waves at a target, which corresponds to a wavelength of 3.2 mm. The ADS millimeter wave energy works on a similar principle as a microwave oven, exciting the water and fat molecules in the skin, and instantly heating them via dielectric heating. One significant difference is that a microwave oven uses the much lower frequency (and longer wavelength) of 2.45 GHz. The short millimeter waves used in ADS only penetrate the top layers of skin, with most of the energy being absorbed within 0.4 mm ( inch), whereas microwaves will penetrate into human tissue about 17 mm (0.67 inch).\n\nThe ADS's effect of repelling humans occurs at slightly higher than 44 °C (111 °F), though first-degree burns occur at about 51 °C (124 °F), and second-degree burns occur at about 58 °C (136 °F). In testing, pea-sized blisters have been observed in less than 0.1% of ADS exposures, indicating that second degree surface burns have been caused by the device. The radiation burns caused are similar to microwave burns, but only on the skin surface due to the decreased penetration of shorter millimeter waves. The surface temperature of a target will continue to rise so long as the beam is applied, at a rate dictated by the target's material and distance from the transmitter, along with the beam's frequency and power level set by the operator. Most human test subjects reached their pain threshold within 3 seconds, and none could endure more than 5 seconds.\n\nA spokesman for the Air Force Research Laboratory described his experience as a test subject for the system: For the first millisecond, it just felt like the skin was warming up. Then it got warmer and warmer and you felt like it was on fire. ... As soon as you're away from that beam your skin returns to normal and there is no pain.\n\nLike all focused energy, the beam will irradiate all matter in the targeted area, including everything beyond/behind it that is not shielded, with no possible discrimination between individuals, objects or materials. Anyone incapable of leaving the target area (e.g., physically handicapped, infants, incapacitated, trapped, etc.) would continue to receive radiation until the operator turned off the beam. Reflective materials such as aluminum cooking foil should reflect this radiation and could be used to make clothing that would be protective against this radiation.\n\nFollowing approximately ten thousand test exposures of volunteers to ADS beams, a Penn State Human Effects Advisory Panel (HEAP) concluded that ADS is a non-lethal weapon that has a high probability of effectiveness with a low probability of injury:\nIn April 2007, one airman in an ADS test was overdosed and received second-degree burns on both legs, and was treated in a hospital for two days. There was also one laboratory accident in 1999 that resulted in a small second-degree burn.\n\nMany possible long-term effects have been studied, with the conclusion that no long-term effects are likely at the exposure levels studied. However, overexposures of either operators or targets may cause thermal injury. According to an official military assessment, \"In the event of an overexposure to a power density sufficient to produce thermal injury, there is an extremely low probability that scars derived from such injury might later become cancerous. Proper wound management further decreases this probability, as well as the probability of hypertrophic scarring or keloid formation.\"\n\nADS operators would be exposed to more than the standard maximum permissible exposure (MPE) limits for RF energy, and military use requires an exception to these exposure limits.\n\nTwo Active Denial Systems were developed under a Defense Department \"Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration\" Program (now known as Joint Concept Technology Demonstration Program) from 2002 to 2007. Unlike typical weapons development programs in the Defense Department, ACTDs/JCTDs are not focused on optimizing the technology; rather they are focused on rapidly assembling the technology in a configuration suitable for user evaluation.\n\nOn September 22, 2004, Raytheon was granted an FCC license to demonstrate the technology to \"law enforcement, military and security organizations.\"\n\nOn October 4, 2004, the United States Department of Defense published the following contract information:\n\nThe military has made the ADS available to the media for demonstrations on a number of occasions. A fully operational and mounted version of the system was demonstrated on January 24, 2007, at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia, United States. A Reuters correspondent who volunteered to be shot with the beam during the demonstration described it as \"similar to a blast from a very hot oven – too painful to bear without diving for cover.\" An Associated Press reporter who volunteered to be engaged stated \"They certainly convinced me that the system could help save the lives of innocent civilians and our young service members\" CBS News correspondent did an in-depth story on ADS in March 2008. A demonstration was conducted for the media on March 9, 2012, at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia.\n\nOn June 21, 2010, Lt. Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the NATO forces commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal, confirmed in an e-mail to \"Wired\" reporter Noah Shachtman that the ADS was deployed in Afghanistan. The spokesman added however that the system has not yet been used operationally.\n\nThe ADS has been removed from service in Afghanistan as of July 25, 2010. A spokesperson for the United States Department of Defense said \"The decision to recall the weapons back to the US was made by commanders on the ground in Afghanistan.\"\n\nA former Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense noted that the recall of ADS from Afghanistan was an \"opportunity missed\" and \"the non-lethality of the ADS system could prove useful in a counterinsurgency operation where avoidance of civilian casualties is essential to mission success.\"\n\nThere have been speculations in open literature for why the ADS has not been used in a theater of operations. Some of the claimed problems expressed have included: (1) that a potential unreliability in certain environmental conditions, because precipitation (rain/snow/fog/mist) often commonly dissipates RF energy, which may moderate the ADS's sensation to \"warm and comfortable\"; (2) that ADS may only work successfully against exposed skin, implying that heavier clothing may reduce its effectiveness and that its tactical usefulness may potentially be limited in striking specific personnel hiding in crowds of civilians, because this 'hiding' situation has not been seen in all recent theaters of operation (was reportedly observed in Somalia and Iraq, but reportedly not in Afghanistan). What the actual performance of ADS is relative to these concerns is not presently known to be published in open literature.\n\nIn 2011, the ADS was redesigned to make it smaller, more reliable, and able to be used on the move. ADS II is being designed to operate from moving aircraft, as well as moving ground vehicles. The redesign does not address problems in different environmental conditions.\n\nThe Air Force Special Operations Command is experimenting with mounting an ADS of the AC-130J Ghostrider gunship to target threatening crowds or individuals on the ground. This is to give the gunship a non-lethal option so the crew has more engagement options. Due to the increasing number of engagements in populated areas, the Air Force is aiming to have field a system within 5–10 years to have enough aircraft available with less lethal systems. The aircraft will apparently use the ADS II version.\n\nADS was developed as a non-lethal weapon. According to Department of Defense policy, non-lethal weapons \"are explicitly designed and primarily employed so as to incapacitate personnel or material, while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury to personnel, and undesired damage to property and the environment.\" ADS has applications for crowd control and perimeter defense, and filling \"the gap between shouting and shooting.\" Other crowd control methods – including pepper spray, tear gas, water cannons, slippery foam and rubber bullets – carry implicit dangers of temporary or permanent injury or accidental death, and often leave residue or residual material. Combinations of acoustic and optical system platforms with ADS can be used to effectively communicate to, warn of escalation of force, introduce optical and auditory deterrents and step function the escalation of transmitted force from relatively benign to ultimately forced dispersal of a crowd, or to deny them from an area or access to an area. A group of people can theoretically be dispersed or induced to leave an area in a manner unlikely to damage personnel, non-involved civilians (no stray bullets), or to nearby buildings or the environment.\n\nNon-lethal weapons are intended to provide options to U.S. troops, for example, \"to stop suspicious vehicles without killing the drivers\". Although the ADS millimeter wave frequency does not affect a car's electronic components, it can be used to deter a driver in an approaching vehicle. In a broader strategic context, non-lethal weapons such as ADS have the potential to offer \"precision, accuracy, and effective duration that can help save military and civilian lives, break the cycle of violence by offering a more graduated response, and even prevent violence from occurring if the opportunity for early or preclusionary engagement arises.\"\n\nThe Council on Foreign Relations noted that \"wider integration of existing types of nonlethal weapons (NLW) into the U.S. Army and Marine Corps could have helped to reduce the damage done by widespread looting and sabotage after the cessation of major conflict in Iraq.\"\n\nIn Afghanistan, the need to minimize civilian casualties has led to restrictive rules of engagement on the use of lethal force by US troops. A National Public Radio correspondent in Afghanistan \"witnessed troops grappling with the dilemma of whether to shoot.\" Non-lethal weapons such as ADS provide an option for US forces in those situations.\n\nThe effects of this radio frequency on humans have been studied by the military for years, and much, but not all of the research has been published openly in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nA news article criticized the sheer amount of time it is taking to field this system, citing the potential it had to avert a great deal of pain and suffering in volatile areas around the world.\n\nAlthough the effects are described as simply \"unpleasant\", the device has the \"potential for death\".\n\nWhile it is claimed not to cause burns under \"ordinary use\", it is also described as being similar to that of an incandescent light bulb being pressed against the skin, which can cause severe burns in just a few seconds. The beam can be focused up to 700 meters away, and is said to penetrate thick clothing although not walls. At 95 GHz, the frequency is much higher than the 2.45 GHz of a microwave oven. This frequency was chosen because it penetrates less than 1/64 of an inch (0.4 mm), which – in most humans, except for eyelids and babies – avoids the second skin layer (the dermis) where critical structures are found such as nerve endings and blood vessels.\n\nThe early methodology of testing, in which volunteers were asked to remove glasses, contact lenses and metallic objects that could cause hot spots, raised concerns as to whether the device would remain true to its purpose of non-lethal temporary incapacitation if used in the field where safety precautions would not be taken. However, these tests were early in the program and part of a thorough and methodical process to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the technology, which has now involved more than 600 volunteer subjects and some 10,200 exposures. As safety was demonstrated in each step of the process, restrictions were removed, and now, according to ADS proponents, there are no restrictions or precautions necessary for volunteers experiencing the effect. Long-term exposure to the beam may cause more serious damage, especially to sensitive tissues, such as those of the eyes. Two people have received second degree burns after exposure to the device. (The actual number of injuries, according to Ms. Stephanie Miller of AFRL/RDHR, is a total of eight – the two previously mentioned, and six others, who healed without medical intervention.)\n\nIn addition, some claim that subjects who have body piercings, jewelry, or tattoos are likely to suffer serious skin damage. Tattooed people can become ill due to high amounts of toxic substances released from heated/melted tattoo pigment. Human effects testing on the large-scale version of ADS included more than 11,000 exposures on over 700 volunteers. Both laboratory research and full-scale test results demonstrated that there is only a 0.1% chance of injury from a System 1 or System 2 exposure.\n\nCritics cite that, although the stated intent of the ADS is to be a non-lethal device designed to temporarily incapacitate, modifications or incorrect use by the operator could turn the ADS into a more damaging weapon that could violate international conventions on warfare (although at this time, ADS has gone through numerous treaty compliance reviews and legal reviews by AF/JAO, and in all cases complies with every treaty and law).\n\nSome have focused on the lower threshold of use which may lead those who use them (especially civilian police) to become \"trigger-happy\", especially in dealing with peaceful protesters. Others have focused on concerns that weapons whose operative principle is that of inflicting pain (though \"non-lethal\") might be useful for such purposes as torture, as they leave no evidence of use, but undoubtedly have the capacity to inflict horrific pain on a restrained subject. According to Wired Magazine, the Active Denial System has been rejected for fielding in Iraq due to Pentagon fears that it would be regarded as an instrument of torture.\n\nDefense contractor Raytheon has developed a smaller version of the ADS, the Silent Guardian. This stripped-down model is primarily marketed for use by law enforcement agencies, the military and other security providers. The system is operated and aimed with a joystick and aiming screen. The device can be used for targets over away, and the beam has a power of 30 kilowatts.\n\nLA County jail is now installing the smaller-sized unit on the ceiling of their jail.\n\nMichael Hanlon – who volunteered to experience its effects – described it as \"a bit like touching a red-hot wire, but there is no heat, only the sensation of heat.\" Raytheon says that pain ceases instantly upon removal of the ray; still, Hanlon reported that the finger he subjected \"was tingling hours later.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44154442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44154442", "title": "Arctic shipping routes", "text": "Arctic shipping routes\n\nArctic shipping routes are the maritime paths used by vessels to navigate through parts or the entirety of the Arctic. There are three main routes that connect the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans: the Northeast Passage, the Northwest Passage, and the Transpolar Sea Route. In addition, two other significant routes exist: the Northern Sea Route, and the Arctic Bridge.\n\nTo connect the Atlantic with the Pacific, the Northwest Passage goes along the Northern Canadian and Alaskan coasts, the Northeast Passage follows the Russian and Norwegian coasts, and the Transpolar Sea Route crosses the Arctic through the North Pole.\n\nThe Arctic Bridge is an internal Arctic route linking Russia to Canada, and the Northern Sea Route trails the Russian coast from the Bering Strait to the East, to the Kara Sea to the West.\n\nThe main difference between the NSR and the NEP is that the latter comprises the Barents Sea and provides access to the port of Murmansk, the largest Russian Arctic port, and to the Atlantic. Given that the NSR constitutes the majority of the NEP, some sources use the terms NSR and NEP interchangeably.\n\nThe navigability of arctic sea routes depends primarily on the expanse of the floe, since it prevents naval trafic for a part of the year. The fluctuation of the area covered by sea ice determines the time windows during which ships can pass through.\nThe NWP encounters thick multiyear ice, complex straits, and pingos that make navigation especially challenging. The eastern routes Northeast Passage and Northern Sea Route have experienced a higher level of activity compared to the Northwest Passage.\n\nThe NEP is relatively easier owing to lower overall ice extent and open water in the Barents Sea. Unlike similar latitudes in Alaska or in Canada, this area remains ice-free due to currents of warm water from the Gulf Stream, feeding into the North Atlantic. For both the NSR and NEP, in summer months the sea ice recedes more quickly compared to the NWP area. This characteristic has become more notable since the early 2000s due to successive low-records of ice age, thickness and extension. Nonetheless, the NEP remains inaccessible for a large part of the year, since in the Laptev Sea and Kara Sea, through which the NEP passes, the minimum risk of non-passage over the whole year is respectively 17% and 15%.\n\nThe Transpolar Sea Route remains a mostly unused route as ships going through it must traverse a permanent sea ice sheet, requiring advanced ice breaking capabilities. The TSR was only accessible 10 days in 2010, with icebreaker type vessels, and those 10 days were still considered as unsafe.\n\nVarious projections indicate that the ice floe will greatly diminish in the future, and might even disappear by the end of the century. The depletion of the arctic ice is already visible. On average over a year, the ice floe has diminished by 4.3% every ten years. However, this reduction is not uniform over the entire year. Indeed, if we observe only the month of September, the ice floe has diminished by 10.7% every ten years, compared to only 2.8% in March. Projection models of the evolution of the arctic ice floe are based on the last 30 years. These projections mainly use circulation models of ocean and atmospheric currents, such as NEMO, the OGCM and the CMIP. They also take into account the evolution of greenhouse gases, such as <chem>CO_2</chem>.\n\nIn 2030, these models predict that 90% of the current area of ice will remain in winter, and only 60% in September. In 2060, they forecast that these numbers will decrease to 85% and 40% respectively. Finally, in 2090, they anticipate 85% in winter, and less than 10% in August–September.\n\nAs a consequence of this reduction of the ice floe, the number of days of navigability on the NEP and NWP is increased, and routes such as the TSR, that are as of yet inaccessible to regular vessels, may open up. The former are for now only open for a few days during the months of August and September, but certain projections indicate that in 2030 they will be open for a whole month. In 2060, the NEP will be open from August to October, and the NWP during August and September. Finally, in 2090, both passages will be open at least three months in a year. Certain projections even say that the NEP will be accessible 5 months per year.\n\nHowever, all these projections remain uncertain since global warming is accelerating, and could have unexpected consequences on climatic conditions such as the perturbation of winds and ocean currents.\n\nThe governance of the NEP has developed considerably in the late 20th century and early 21st century. The main sources of governance are the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the Arctic Council (AC), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the domestic legislation of the Arctic countries. In combination, they cover territorial claims, economic exploitation, technical shipping requirements, environmental protection, and search and rescue responsibilities.\n\nThe commercial interest of the Arctic shipping routes lies in the shorter travel distances they offer between several economic poles, such as Northern Europe and East Asia. Indeed, passing through the Arctic, from Northern Europe to Shanghai for example, can reduce the distance covered by ships by up to 3000 nautical miles, compared to the same journey when passing through the Suez canal. Nevertheless, not all journeys are improved since the voyage from Northern Europe to Vietnam, for example, results in an additional 1000 nautical miles covered.\n\nFurthermore, reduced distance does not always imply time gained as well. A study by the Asian journal of shipping and logistics concludes that depending on the ice conditions in the Arctic, journeys from Northern Europe to East Asia may not save any time at all. Indeed, the overall time of the journey depends greatly on the time spent in ice-water which slows down ships considerably. As such, if the routes are open only 3 months in a year, which implies bad ice conditions, the aforementioned transit could result in a loss of 3 days compared to the one passing through the Suez canal. However, if the routes are open all year round, which implies perfect ice conditions, the transit could result in a gain of up to 7 days. Another study even estimates that the time gained could reach up to 16 days.\n\nThe economic viability of the Arctic routes does not only depend on their time efficiency; as a review commissioned by the UK government points out, there are many costs to be considered. Firstly, the review notes that Russia imposes tariffs on the NSR, the most used shipping route because of its favourable ice conditions, as opposed to Canada that imposes no tariffs on the use of the NWP, which, however, has worse ice conditions. The TSR can also be considered as an attractive prospect in the future, if the Arctic sea ice recedes considerably.\n\nLinked to these tariffs is the need for an icebreaker fleet to maintain routes and ports. Indeed, Russia does impose heavy fees for the use of the NSR, but it also maintains it, which is not without cost either.\n\nAnother important factor to consider is that high fuel prices make Arctic shipping more viable, and inversely so for low fuel prices.\n\nFinally, the lack of ports along the Arctic routes creates the need for special vessels, adapted to the ice conditions of the Arctic, with experienced crew. The lack of ports also means that container shipping is less attractive since vessels cannot exchange cargo along the way.\n\nThe development of arctic shipping routes has not gone uncontested, with concerns being raised about existing challenges that must be overcome. The UK Government Office for Science lists three causes of increased risk:\n\n\nAdditionally, further technical and technological advancements are required to provide specialised vessels adapted to extreme weather conditions with high reliability and at a low cost.\n\nIntensifying the navigation along the Arctic routes also entails external policy issues. Interest shown in the last decades by major shipping companies has provoked a response of Arctic countries. A multitude of claims cause uncertainties relating to the legal status of some of the routes: it is still unknown if the NSR must be considered as internal waters, territorial waters or international straits. Most importantly, transiting ships will lose their right of innocent passage if parts of the NSR are claimed to be internal waters (see more under Arctic cooperation and politics).\n\nFinally, environmental policies in the Polar Code must be considered before the Arctic can become the new axis of intercontinental shipping. These restrictions are likely to become more strict as the market grows, to protect the existing nature and wildlife.\n\nIn 2011 the Arctic countries, organized through the Arctic Council, signed the first binding circumpolar treaty, the \"Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic\". With it they officially established the areas of responsibility of each coastal country.\n\n\n"}

The height correction alone gives a free-air gravity anomaly.\n\nThe Bouguer anomaly is related to the observed gravity formula_1 as follows:\n\nHere, \n\nA Bouguer reduction is called \"simple\" or \"incomplete\" if the terrain is approximated by an infinite flat plate called the \"Bouguer plate\". A \"refined\" or \"complete\" Bouguer reduction removes the effects of terrain precisely. The difference between the two, the differential gravitational effect of the unevenness of the terrain, is called the \"terrain effect\". It is always negative.\n\nThe gravitational acceleration formula_11 outside a Bouguer plate is perpendicular to the plate and towards it, with magnitude \"2πG\" times the mass per unit area, where formula_12 is the gravitational constant. It is independent of the distance to the plate (as can be proven most simply with Gauss's law for gravity, but can also be proven directly with Newton's law of gravity). The value of formula_12 is 6.67 × 10 N m kg, so formula_11 is 4.191 × 10 N m kg times the mass per unit area. Using 1 Gal = 0.01 m s (1 cm s) we get 4.191 × 10 mGal m kg times the mass per unit area.

A combination of two equal parallel infinite plates does not produce any gravity inside.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "86200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86200", "title": "Ceridwen", "text": "Ceridwen\n\nCeridwen ( \"Ce-rid-wen\") was an enchantress in Welsh medieval legend. She was the mother of a hideous son, Morfran, and a beautiful daughter, Creirwy. Her husband was Tegid Foel, and they lived near Bala Lake (\"Llyn Tegid\") in north Wales. Medieval Welsh poetry refers to her as possessing the cauldron of poetic inspiration (Awen) and the Tale of Taliesin recounts her swallowing her servant Gwion Bach who is then reborn through her as the poet Taliesin. Ceridwen is regarded by many modern Pagans as the Celtic goddess of rebirth, transformation, and inspiration.\n\nThe earliest documented spelling of the name \"Kerdwin\" is \"Cyrridven\", which occurs in the \"Black Book of Carmarthen\". Sir Ifor Williams translates this name as \"crooked woman\", although the precise meaning of the stems \"cyrrid\" and \"cwrr\" (sometimes translated as \"crooked\" or \"bent\") is uncertain. \"Ben/ven\" means \"woman\" or \"female\". If \"wen\" is not a corruption of either of these, then it may derive from the adjective \"gwyn\" (fem. \"gwen\"), meaning \"fair\", \"beloved\", \"blessed\", or \"sacred\". \"Wen\" is sometimes suffixed to the names of female saints (e.g. Dwynwen). In 19th century literature and etymology the name \"Ket\", \"Ked\" and variants were assumed to relate to the goddess Ceridwen.\n\nAccording to the late medieval \"Tale of Taliesin\", included in some modern editions of the \"Mabinogion\", Ceridwen's son, Morfran (also called Afagddu), was hideously ugly, so Ceridwen sought to make him wise in compensation. She made a potion in her magical cauldron to grant the gift of wisdom and poetic inspiration, also called Awen.\n\nThe mixture had to be boiled for a year and a day. She set Morda, a blind man, to tend the fire beneath the cauldron, while Gwion Bach, a young boy, stirred the concoction. The first three drops of liquid from this potion gave wisdom; the rest was a fatal poison. Three hot drops spilled onto Gwion's thumb as he stirred, burning him. He instinctively put his thumb in his mouth, and gained the wisdom and knowledge Ceridwen had intended for her son. Realising that Ceridwen would be angry, Gwion fled. Ceridwen chased him. Using the powers of the potion he turned himself into a hare. She became a greyhound. He became a fish and jumped into a river. She transformed into an otter. He turned into a bird; she became a hawk. Finally, he turned into a single grain of corn. She then became a hen and, being a goddess (or enchantress, depending on the version of the tale), she found and ate him without trouble. But because of the potion he was not destroyed. When Ceridwen became pregnant, she knew it was Gwion and resolved to kill the child when he was born. However, when he was born, he was so beautiful that she could not do it. She threw him in the ocean instead, sewing him inside a leather-skin bag (or set him in a coracle, depending on the story). The child did not die, but was rescued on a Welsh shore – near Aberdyfi according to most versions of the tale – by a prince named Elffin ap Gwyddno; the reborn infant grew to become the legendary bard Taliesin.\n\nIt has been suggested that Ceridwen first appeared as a simple sorceress character in the \"Tale of Taliesin\". Its earliest surviving text dates from the mid-16th century, but it appears from its language to be a 9th-century composition, according to Hutton. References to Ceridwen and her cauldron found in the work of the 12th century \"Gogynfeirdd\" or Poets of the Princes (such as Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr) he thus considers later, derivative works. In them, according to Hutton, Ceridwen is transformed from a sorceress into a goddess of poetry. Citing this and a couple of other examples, Hutton proposes that the \"Gogynfeirdd\" substantially created a new mythology not reflective of earlier paganism. Nonetheless, references to Ceridwen's cauldron (\"pair Ceridwen\") are also to be found in some of the early mythological poems attributed to the legendary Taliesin in the \"Book of Taliesin\".\n\nThe Victorian poet Thomas Love Peacock also wrote a poem entitled the \"Cauldron of Ceridwen\". Later writers identified her as having originally been a pagan goddess, speculating on her role in a supposed Celtic pantheon. John Rhys in 1878 referred to the Solar Myth theory of Max Müller according to which \"Gwenhwyfar and Ceridwen are dawn goddesses.\" Charles Isaac Elton in 1882 referred to her as a \"white fairy\". Robert Graves later fitted her into his concept of the Threefold Goddess, in which she was interpreted as a form of the destructive side of the goddess. In Wicca, Ceridwen is a goddess of change and rebirth and transformation, and her cauldron symbolises knowledge and inspiration.\n\n"}

It extends along the Andes between the latitudes of 36 and 39° S. The formation overlies across an angular unconformity older sedimentary rocks of continental origin as well as dykes and plutons that intruded these sediments. The unconformity has an irregular form attesting to a topography that was flattened out by the deposition of the Cola de Zorro sediments. Cola de Zorro Formation was deposited in Pliocene and Pleistocene times. The formation interdigitates with lavas of old and eroded volcanoes. Lavas of modern volcanoes, like Antuco, unconformbly overlies the formations and dykes associated to modern volcanoes intrude it. In some localities the formation is covered by moraines.\n\nThe Cola de Zorra Formation is largely undeformed except from some minor tilting caused by block tectonics. The strata of Cola de Zorro Formation are sub-horizontal. The formation is dissected by fluvial and glacial erosion. \nThe formation is made up of tuff, volcanic breccia and volcanic agglomerate. The lavas are made up of andesite, trachyandesite, trachyte, basaltic andesite and basalt. Volcanic rocks of Cola de Zorro Formation belong to two magma series. Most volcanic rocks are part of a calc-alkaline magma series. Trachyandesites and trachytes of the Pino Hachado and Pichachén areas are alkaline.\n\nThe southwestern fringes of Cola de Zorro Formation were redefined in 1997 as being part of Malleco Formation by geologists Manuel Suárez and Carlos Emparan. \n"}

There are also about 18 very large commercial customers directly connected to the transmission system.\n\nEirGrid is the independent state-owned body licensed by the CRU to act as transmission system operator (TSO) and is responsible for the operation, development and maintenance of the system. The TSO also offers terms and levies charges to market participants for the connection to and use of the transmission system, which are regulated by the CRU. ESB Networks is licensed by the CRU as the owner of the transmission system and is responsible for carrying out the maintenance and construction of the system.\n\nThe CRU sets the allowed revenue/tariffs for the transmission business and approves the connection policy for generators and suppliers connecting to and/or using the network.\n\nThe Distribution Network is the medium and low voltage electricity network used to deliver electricity to connection points such as houses, offices, shops, and street lights. The Distribution Network includes all overhead electricity lines, poles and underground cables used to bring power to Ireland’s customers.\n\nESB Networks (a ring fenced subsidiary within the ESB Group) is the Distribution System Operator licensed by the CRU, responsible for the building, maintaining and operating the distribution network infrastructure. The Distribution Network is owned by ESB, the licensed Distribution Asset Owner.\n\nThe CER sets the allowed revenue/tariffs for the distribution business and approves the connection policy for generators and suppliers connecting to and/or using the network.\n\nThe CRU licenses and monitors electricity suppliers.\n\nThe CRU has overseen the gradual liberalisation of the electricity supply market which culminated in full market opening in February 2005. The regulatory framework created the right environment for competition to develop and since then competition has increased in the business and domestic markets. As a result, in 2010 the CRU published its Roadmap to Deregulation, which set out the milestones for the end of price regulation. All business markets were deregulated from 1 October 2010. Since April 2011 the domestic market has been deregulated, so all electricity suppliers may set their own tariffs without price regulation from the CRU.\n\nSince 1 November 2007 the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, (known then as the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER)) and Utility Regulator, together referred to as the Regulatory Authorities or RAs, have jointly regulated the all-Island wholesale electricity market known as the Single Electricity Market (SEM). The SEM covers both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe decision-making body which governs the market is the SEM Committee, consisting of the CRU, the Utility Regulator as well as an independent member (who also has a deputy), with each entity having one vote.\n\nThe detailed rules of the SEM are set out in the Trading and Settlement Code, which is overseen by the SEM Committee.\n\nAt a high level, the SEM includes a centralised gross pool (or spot) market which, given its mandatory nature for key generators and suppliers, is fully liquid. In this pool electricity is bought and sold through a market clearing mechanism, whereby generators bid in the Short Run Marginal Cost (SRMC) and receive the System Marginal Price (SMP) for each trading period for their scheduled market quantities. Generators also receive separate payments for the provision of available generation capacity through a capacity payment mechanism, and constraint payments for differences between the market schedule and the system dispatch. Suppliers purchasing energy from the pool pay the SMP for each trading period along with capacity costs and system charges.\n\nFor further information on SEM please see www.semcommittee.com.\n\nThere are two types of gas pipelines operating around the country. The larger pipes which transport gas long distances are known as transmission pipes and the smaller pipes which bring gas from the transmission pipes to individual premises are known as distribution pipes. Ervia, formerly Bord Gáis Éireann (BGE), owns the transmission and distribution systems in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nBord Gáis Networks (BGN) is the designated subsidiary within Ervia which constructs and extends the natural gas network in Ireland to the required safety standards. Gaslink is currently the TSO and DSO for gas.\n\nThe CRU sets the allowed revenue/tariffs and connection policy for the gas transmission and distribution network (similar to electricity).\n\nThe CRU licenses and monitors gas suppliers. Since 1 July 2007 Ireland's retail gas market has been open to competition and all gas customers are eligible to switch their gas supplier. This represents over half a million domestic customers. \n\nThe CRU continues to regulate the revenue earned and tariffs charged by Bord Gáis Energy Supply to domestic customers, and works to resolve complaints that customers have with energy companies.\n\nThe CRU is the independent economic regulator for public water and wastewater services in Ireland. In the consultation process leading up to the introduction of water charges in Ireland, the CRU has proposed that Irish Water provide two products and one service, with each household receiving a maximum of one product (either \"Water\" or \"Not for Human Consumption Water\") at a time.\nIt is proposed that the wastewater service be charged per unit product consumed.\n\n\n"}

It is usually isolated or rises above other surrounding foothills, and is often, but not always, of volcanic origin.\n\nConical hills or mountains occur in different shapes and are not necessarily geometrically-shaped cones; some are more tower-shaped or have an asymmetric curve on one side. Typically, however, they have a circular base and smooth sides with a gradient of up to 30°. Such conical mountains are found in all volcanically-formed areas of the world such as the Bohemian Central Uplands in the Czech Republic, the Rhön in Germany or the Massif Central in France.\n\nThe conical hill as a geomorphological term first appeared in the German language, as \"Kegelberg\", coined by Goethe and geologists of his era. From their natural appearance these were mostly basaltic or phonolitic landforms in the shape of a mathematical cone, hence why the term came to be used in the early geological literature.\nThe first systematic geological mapping of the Kingdom of Saxony, proposed and started by Abraham Gottlob Werner, describes, in his later works, numerous mountains and hills of volcanic or subvolcanic origin as \"Kegel\" (\"cone\") or \"Kegelberg\" (\"conical hill/mountain\"). The term was introduced more definitively by Carl Friedrich Naumann in \"Notes to Section VII of the Geognostic Charter of the Kingdom of Saxony and its Adjacent Territories\" (\"Erläuterungen zu Section VII der geognostischen Charte des Königreiches Sachsen und der angränzenden Länderabtheilungen\") thus: \"The ordinary form of basalt and phonolitic hills is generally so wonderfully uniform that you can often recognize them even from a distance. They are cones. Of course, this typical form has many variations; the [normally] round base may be elongated, the peak may take the form of a rocky crest or ridge, ... but most forms can be reduced at least to a conical or a cone-segment shape. ... Flat ridges are then arranged in rows, out of which rise only a very isolated basalt or phonolite cones.\"\n\nIn this work, which was published by Naumann and later revised by Bernhard Cotta, the most important hills are described in the relevant map sheets, for example: \"33. The Mittenberg, a conical hill in the centre between Tollenstein, Schönfeld and Neuhütte; rock, coarse splinters, with grey feldspar crystals.\"\n\nToday the descriptors \"cone\", \"conical hill\" or \"conical mountain\" are mainly used as morphological terms in geography for a steep-sided, isolated hill or mountain, because they are not always seen or described in connexion with volcanic processes.\n\nAll stratovolcanoes and shield volcanoes have a tendency to form a cone at the surface. However, stratovolcanoes are able to form steeper sides whilst shield volcanoes only form very flat cones. The reason for this is that stratovolcanoes are composed largely of solid, eruptive material, whereas shield volcanoes are built up mainly by fluid lava flows.\n\nOver the course of time, after several eruptions, a cone of debris forms from the eruptive material. The natural conical shape so formed is simply a result of the fact that the amount of ejected material decreases with the radially distance from the crater. The layer of debris deposited is greater near the volcano than further away, so the volcano grows more rapidly close to the crater itself. The slope gradient of the resulting volcano is dependent both on the angle of repose as well as the speed at which the volcano is weathered. The angle of repose is, in turn, dependent on the composition of the lava, its viscosity and rate of solidification, and also the amount of ejected loose rock.\nMany volcanoes tend to produce subsidiary craters or adventive cones. These are new openings formed on the sides of the volcano through which new material is ejected sometimes only on one side. As a result, these mountains lose their ideal conical shape. The formation of an almost perfect conical mountain or hill is only possible where there is a stable, central crater. Many volcanoes are therefore only conical from one direction of view; from other angles they appear to have an irregular shape or bulges.\n\nConical hills may form in tropical karst regions, such terrain being known as kegelkarst. A typical example of non-volcanic conical hills are the Chocolate Hills in Bohol on the Philippines.\n\nIn almost all mountain regions of the world, conical peaks may be formed by erosion processes, but they are not usually isolated landforms. Often they arise through the formation of ordinary riverine meanders. But they can also result from the action of an entrenched river that has cut deeply into a plateau. The resulting cutoff meander spur may be cone-shaped.\n\nThe artificially created hills or mounds associated, for example, with mining also tend to be cone-shaped. These artificial hills are also free-standing and, once tipping has finished, they may become conical hills overgrown with vegetation. However, as artificial features they are classed as spoil tips rather than natural hills.\n\n\n"}

It was believed that the cats had a sixth sense and would have psychic abilities in the afterlife to find the spirits. Putting the cat in the wall was seen as a blood sacrifice to ward off the evil spirits. Although some accounts claim the cats were walled in alive, examination of recovered specimens indicates post-mortem concealment in most cases.\n\nIn the British Isles, as well as in northern Europe and North America, the dried or mummified bodies of cats are frequently found concealed within structures and are believed to have been placed there to bring good luck or to protect the building and its occupants from harm. In some cases, the animals are found deliberately posed as if in the midst of attack. In other cases, they are accompanied by dried rats, mice, or birds.\n\nCats in ancient Egypt were valued very highly and were seen to be very close to the gods.

{"id": "4362288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4362288", "title": "Ekman layer", "text": "Ekman layer\n\nThe Ekman layer is the layer in a fluid where there is a force balance between pressure gradient force, Coriolis force and turbulent drag. It was first described by Vagn Walfrid Ekman. Ekman layers occur both in the atmosphere and in the ocean.\n\nThere are two types of Ekman layers. The first type occurs at the surface of the ocean and is forced by surface winds, which act as a drag on the surface of the ocean. The second type occurs at the bottom of the atmosphere and ocean, where frictional forces are associated with flow over rough surfaces.\n\nEkman developed the theory of the Ekman layer after Fridtjof Nansen observed that ice drifts at an angle of 20°-40° to the right of the prevailing wind direction while on an Arctic expedition aboard the Fram. Nansen asked his colleague, Vilhelm Bjerknes to set one of his students upon study of the problem. Bjerknes tapped Ekman, who presented his results in 1902 as his doctoral thesis.\n\nThe mathematical formulation of the Ekman layer begins by assuming a neutrally stratified fluid, a balance between the forces of pressure gradient, Coriolis and turbulent drag.\n\nwhere formula_2 and formula_3 are the velocities in the formula_4 and formula_5 directions, respectively, formula_6 is the local Coriolis parameter, and formula_7 is the diffusive eddy viscosity, which can be derived using mixing length theory. Note that formula_8 is a modified pressure: we have incorporated the hydrostatic of the pressure, to take account of gravity.\n\nThere are many regions where an Ekman layer is theoretically plausible; they include the bottom of the atmosphere, near the surface of the earth and ocean, the bottom of the ocean, near the sea floor and at the top of the ocean, near the air-water interface. Different boundary conditions are appropriate for each of these different situations. Each of these situations can be accounted for through the boundary conditions applied to the resulting system of ordinary differential equations. The separate cases of top and bottom boundary layers are shown below.\n\nWe will consider boundary conditions of the Ekman layer in the upper ocean:\n\nwhere formula_10 and formula_11 are the components of the surface stress, formula_12, of the wind field or ice layer at the top of the ocean.\n\nFor the boundary condition on the other side, as formula_13, where formula_14 and formula_15 are the geostrophic flows in the formula_16 and formula_17 directions.\n\nThese differential equations can be solved to find:\n\nThe value formula_19 is called the Ekman layer depth, and gives an indication of the penetration depth of wind-induced turbulent mixing in the ocean. Note that it varies on two parameters: the turbulent diffusivity formula_20, and the latitude, as encapsulated by formula_21. For a typical formula_22, and at 45° latitude (formula_23), then formula_19 is approximately 45 meters. This Ekman depth prediction does not always agree precisely with observations.\n\nThis variation of horizontal velocity with depth (formula_25) is referred to as the Ekman spiral, diagrammed above and at right.\n\nBy applying the continuity equation we can have the vertical velocity as following\n\nNote that when vertically-integrated, the volume transport associated with the Ekman spiral is to the right of the wind direction in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThe traditional development of Ekman layers bounded below by a surface utilizes two boundary conditions:\n\nThere is much difficulty associated with observing the Ekman layer for two main reasons: the theory is too simplistic as it assumes a constant eddy viscosity, which Ekman himself anticipated, saying\n\nand because it is difficult to design instruments with great enough sensitivity to observe the velocity profile in the ocean.\n\nThe bottom Ekman layer can readily be observed in a rotating cylindrical tank of water by dropping in dye and changing the rotation rate slightly. Surface Ekman layers can also be observed in rotating tanks.\n\nIn the atmosphere, the Ekman solution generally overstates the magnitude of the horizontal wind field because it does not account for the velocity shear in the surface layer. Splitting the boundary layer into the surface layer and the Ekman layer generally yields more accurate results.\n\nThe Ekman layer, with its distinguishing feature the Ekman spiral, is rarely observed in the ocean. The Ekman layer near the surface of the ocean extends only about 10 – 20 meters deep, and instrumentation sensitive enough to observe a velocity profile in such a shallow depth has only been available since around 1980. Also, wind waves modify the flow near the surface, and make observations close to the surface rather difficult.\n\nObservations of the Ekman layer have only been possible since the development of robust surface moorings and sensitive current meters. Ekman himself developed a current meter to observe the spiral that bears his name, but was not successful.\nThe Vector Measuring Current Meter and the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler are both used to measure current.\n\nThe first documented observations of an Ekman-like spiral in the ocean were made in the Arctic Ocean from a drifting ice flow in 1958. More recent observations include (not an exhaustive list):\nCommon to several of these observations spirals were found to be 'compressed', displaying larger estimates of eddy viscosity when considering the rate of rotation with depth than the eddy viscosity derived from considering the rate of decay of speed.\n\n\n"}

Ficus glomerata ) is a species of plant in the family Moraceae. Popularly known as the cluster fig tree, Indian fig tree or goolar (gular) fig, this is native to Australia, Malesia, Indo-China and the Indian subcontinent. It is unusual in that its figs grow on or close to the tree trunk, termed cauliflory. In India, the tree and its fruit are called \"gular\" in the north and \"atti\" in the south. The fruits are a favourite staple of the common Indian macaque. It serves as a food plant for the caterpillars of the two-brand crow butterfly (\"Euploea sylvester\") of northern Australia.\n\nIn the Atharva Veda, this fig tree (Sanskrit: \"uumbara\" or \"udumbara\") is given prominence as a means for acquiring prosperity and vanquishing foes. For instance, regarding an amulet of the \"udumbara\" tree, a hymn (AV xix,31) extols:\n\nIt has been described in the story of Raja Harischandra of the Ikshvaku dynasty, that the crown was a branch of this \"udumbura\" tree, set in a circlet of gold. Additionally, the throne (\"simhasana\") was constructed out of this wood and the royal personage would ascend it on his knee, chanting to the gods to ascend it with him, which they did so, albeit unseen.\n\nIts leaves are an indispensable part of many Hindu \"havan\"s.\n\nBoth the tree and the flower are referred to as the udumbara (Sanskrit, Pali; Devanagari: उडुम्बर) in Buddhism. \"Udumbara\" can also refer to the blue lotus (\"nila-udumbara\", \"blue \"udumbara\") flower. The \"udumbara\" flower appears in chapters 2 and 27 of the Lotus Sutra, an important Mahayana Buddhist text. The Japanese word \"udon-ge\" (, literally \"udon\"/\"udumbara\" flower\") was used by Dōgen Zenji to refer to the flower of the \"udumbara\" tree in chapter 68 of the \"Shōbōgenzō\" (\"Treasury of the Eye of the True Dharma\"). Dōgen places the \"udonge\" in the context of the Flower Sermon given by Gautama Buddha on Vulture Peak. \"Udonge\" is also used to refer to the eggs of the lacewing insect. The eggs are laid in a pattern similar to a flower, and its shape is used for divination in Asian fortune telling.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism, the plant is said to have used as the tree for achieved enlightenment (\"bodhi\") by the 26th Lord Buddha, Konaagama ().\n\nThe Ovambo people call the fruit of the cluster fig \"eenghwiyu\" and use it to distill \"ombike\", their traditional liquor.\n\nThe bark of \"audumbar\" (\"oudumbar\") tree is said to have healing power.\nIn countries like India, the bark is rubbed on a stone with water to make a paste, which can be applied over afflicted by boils or mosquito bites. Allow the paste to dry on the skin and reapply after a few hours. For people whose skin is especially sensitive to insect bites, this is a very simple home remedy.\n\n"}

As the second module sent into orbit by the company, this spacecraft builds on the data and experience gleaned from its previously orbited sister-ship \"Genesis I\". Like its sister-ship and other modules being designed by Bigelow Aerospace, this spacecraft is based on the NASA TransHab design, which provides increased interior volume and reduced launch diameter along with potentially reduced mass compared to traditional rigid structures.\n\n\"Genesis II\" was \"retired\" when its avionics systems stopped working after two and a half years. It remains in orbit, allowing researchers to continue testing the long-term viability of expandable space structures.\n\nSimilar to the process endured by Bigelow for \"Genesis I\", transporting \"Genesis II\" to Russia for launch was the end result of nearly a year of regulatory processes due to restrictions imposed by International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and other procedures, both in the United States and abroad. After leaving North Las Vegas, Nevada in the United States, the spacecraft made a stopover in Luxembourg before being flown on an Antonov An-124 to Orsk, Russia, and transported over ground to the Dombarovskiy base. \"Genesis II\" made its final move into the Assembly, Integration and Test Building on 29 March 2007. Originally slated for a 6 August 2006 launch, ISC Kosmotras delayed the launch to 30 January 2007, due to the failure of a Dnepr rocket in July 2006. The launch was delayed an additional four times (1 April 19 April, 26 April, and 23 May) due to technical and scheduling reasons before its eventual launch on 28 June 2007 at 15:02 UTC.\n\nAs with \"Genesis I\", it was launched aboard an ISC Kosmotras Dnepr rocket from Dombarovsky Air Base near Yasniy, Russia. It successfully reached orbit after separation from the rocket at 15:16 UTC. Due to the mechanics of its orbit, first contact with the craft was established once it passed over SpaceQuest, Ltd.'s Fairfax, Virginia receiving station at 22:20 UTC, confirming that it was functioning nominally with power and air pressure at expected levels. Externally, \"Genesis II\" is identical in size to \"Genesis I\"; as such, it is a one-third scale of the full-size \"BA 330\" model, with on-orbit measurements of in length and in diameter, with an interior habitable volume of . As part of its inflatable design, \"Genesis II\" launched with a diameter of , expanding to its full size after entering orbit. Within two days of launch, attitude control systems had damped all rotation and oriented antennae toward Earth.\n\nOn 12 December 2007, Bigelow Aerospace provided an update indicating that \"Genesis II\" was in good health. All cameras had been tested and more than 4,000 photographs had been taken. The craft was in a nearly circular orbit with an eccentricity of 0.028, and had only lost from launch to that time. Attitude control systems and all eight solar arrays were operational, and no damage to the outer surface of the craft was observed. Internal pressure was noted as holding between , with the variation caused by \"Genesis II\" moving in and out of sunlight during its orbit.\n\nOn 23 April 2009, Bigelow Aerospace announced that \"Genesis II\" had surpassed the 10,000 orbit mark, having been in space for 665 days and travelling over 270 million miles (430 million kilometers).\n\nIn February 2011, Bigelow reported that the vehicle had \"performed flawlessly in terms of pressure maintenance and thermal control-environmental containment.\" Although the design life of the spacecraft avionics was only six months, the avionics systems worked flawlessly for over two and a half years before failure. The data received after the first six months was a re-verification of the validation test suite that was accomplished during the design life period.\n\nThe orbital life is estimated to be 12 years, with a gradually decaying orbit resulting in re-entry into Earth's atmosphere and burn-up expected. Its operations lasted approximately 2.5 years, significantly longer than its expected 6-month mission duration. , the vehicle remains in orbit.\n\n\"Genesis II\" features a number of improvements over the first pathfinder that was launched. In addition to the standard guidance control systems used on \"Genesis I\", it has reaction wheel assemblies and a precision measurement system, which are used to affect the spacecraft's rotation rate and angular momentum without expending fuel. It carries 22 cameras (nine more than the 13 on \"Genesis I\") for photographing and filming cargo and ship conditions both inside and out. Some of these are on articulated platforms, and one wireless camera that is capable of additional exterior imaging. Instead of the single-tank inflation system used on the first craft, \"Genesis II\" employs multiple tanks for added reliability and to allow for more finely tuned gas control.\n\nAdditional layers have been added to the outer shield for increased protection and thermal management. Finally, the on-board sensor suite was enhanced with additional sensors for pressure, temperature, attitude control, and radiation detection, which will help determine the impact of the orbital environment on the integrity of shipboard systems. \"Genesis II\" does not have any propulsion.\n\nOn both the interior and exterior, \"Genesis II\" carries several non-critical systems for scientific, commercial and entertainment purposes.\n\nFor the science aspect, \"Genesis II\" carries an upgraded version of the original life-sciences module and is colloquially termed \"Life in a Box\". This module includes habitats for three organisms: the Madagascar hissing cockroach, previously carried aboard \"Genesis I\"; the South African flat rock scorpion, \"Hadogenes troglodytes\"; and a colony of seed-harvester ants, \"Pogonomyrmex californicus\", along with the queen ant for long-term colonization possibilities. This biobox system includes automated food and water delivery systems, and fans keep fresh air available by circulating internal air with that inside the rest of the spacecraft. Sensors and cameras will monitor the health and activities of the biobox inhabitants, and images of the interior are intended for display on Bigelow's website.\n\nThere are two commercial payloads included on \"Genesis II\". The first is the \"Fly Your Stuff\" program, which allowed individuals and customers to send photographs and other small items into orbit for a fee.

At West Point he studied with John Torrey. He devised various improvements in the construction of the microscope and made an extensive collection of microscopic objects and of algæ, which he left to the Boston Society of Natural History. In 1857 he was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as a member of the National Institute for the Promotion of Science, a precursor to the Smithsonian Institution. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) in 1845. Bailey and his son William were survivors of the steamboat \"Henry Clay\" disaster on July 28, 1852, though his wife and daughter, both named Maria, were among the casualties. \n\nBailey died on February 26, 1857, at the beginning of his term of office as President of the AAAS. On August 19, 1857, Augustus Addison Gould delivered a speech to the AAAS in commemoration of Bailey's life. The speech was subsequently published in the \"American Journal of Science and Arts\", volume xxv (second series), (New Haven, May 1858).\n\nHe wrote many articles on scientific subjects for the \"American Journal of Science\" and for scientific societies, a report on the infusorial fossils of California, and a valuable volume of \"Microscopical Sketches\", containing 3000 original figures.\n\nThe genus Baileya, a North American genus of sun-loving wildflowers native to the deserts of northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States was named by botanists William Henry Harvey and Asa Gray in honor of their colleague Jacob Whitman Bailey.\n\nIt was Jacob Whitman Bailey that Lieut.

Whereas England had its Areas of Search based on 46 counties, those in Wales were based on a combination of the counties and smaller districts. In 1974, Wales was divided into 8 counties, with 37 districts. The NCC created 12 Welsh Areas of Search; they mostly follow county borders, but the larger counties (Dyfed, Powys and Gwynedd) were divided into multiple Areas using district borders.

Agassiz grew up in Switzerland, and he received Doctor of Philosophy and medical degrees at Erlangen and Munich, respectively. After studying with Cuvier and Humboldt in Paris, Agassiz was appointed professor of natural history at the University of Neuchâtel. After visiting Harvard University mid-career, he emigrated to the United States in 1847. He went on to become professor of zoology and geology at Harvard, to head its Lawrence Scientific School, and to found its Museum of Comparative Zoology.\n\nAgassiz is known for his regimen of observational data gathering and analysis. He made vast institutional and scientific contributions to zoology, geology, and related areas, including writing multi-volume research books running to thousands of pages. He is particularly known for his contributions to ichthyological classification, including of extinct species, and to the study of geological history, including to the founding of glaciology. In the 20th and 21st centuries, Agassiz's resistance to Darwinian evolution, and the scientific racism implicit in his writings on human polygenism, have tarnished his reputation and led to controversies over his legacy.\n\nLouis Agassiz was born in Môtier (now part of Haut-Vully) in the canton of Fribourg, Switzerland. The son of a pastor, Agassiz was educated first at home, he then spent four years of secondary school in Bienne, entering in 1818 and completing his elementary studies in Lausanne. Having adopted medicine as his profession, Agassiz studied successively at the universities of Zürich, Heidelberg, and Munich; while there, he extended his knowledge of natural history, especially of botany. In 1829 he received the degree of doctor of philosophy at Erlangen, and in 1830 that of doctor of medicine at Munich. Moving to Paris, he came under the tutelage of Alexander von Humboldt (and later his financial benevolence). Humboldt and Georges Cuvier launched him on his careers of geology and zoology respectively. Previously, he had not paid special attention to the study of ichthyology, but it soon became the focus of his life's work.\n\nIn 1819–1820, the German biologists Johann Baptist von Spix and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius undertook an expedition to Brazil. They returned home to Europe with many natural objects, including an important collection of the freshwater fish of Brazil, especially of the Amazon River. Spix, who died in 1826, did not live long enough to work out the history of these fish, and Martius selected Agassiz for this project. Agassiz threw himself into the work with an enthusiasm that would go on to characterize the rest of life's work. The task of describing the Brazilian fish was completed and published in 1829. This was followed by research into the history of fish found in Lake Neuchâtel. Enlarging his plans, in 1830 he issued a prospectus of a \"History of the Freshwater Fish of Central Europe\". It was only in 1839, however, that the first part of this publication appeared, and it was completed in 1842.\n\nIn 1832, Agassiz was appointed professor of natural history at the University of Neuchâtel. The fossil fish in the rock of the surrounding region, the slates of Glarus and the limestones of Monte Bolca, soon attracted his attention. At the time, very little had been accomplished in their scientific study. Agassiz, as early as 1829, planned the publication of a work which, more than any other, laid the foundation of his worldwide fame. Five volumes of his \"Recherches sur les poissons fossiles\" (\"Research on Fossil Fish\") were published from 1833 to 1843. They were magnificently illustrated, chiefly by Joseph Dinkel. In gathering materials for this work Agassiz visited the principal museums in Europe, and, meeting Cuvier in Paris, he received much encouragement and assistance from him. They had known him for seven years at the time.\n\nAgassiz found that his palaeontological analyses required a new ichthyological classification. The fossils he examined rarely showed any traces of the soft tissues of fish, but, instead, consisted chiefly of the teeth, scales, and fins, with the bones being perfectly preserved in comparatively few instances. He, therefore, adopted a classification that divided fish into four groups: Ganoids, Placoids, Cycloids and Ctenoids, based on the nature of the scales and other dermal appendages. This did much to improve fish taxonomy, but Aggasiz's classification has since been superseded.\n\nAgassiz needed financial support to continue his work. The British Association and the Earl of Ellesmere—then Lord Francis Egerton—stepped in to help. The 1,290 original drawings made for the work were purchased by the Earl, and presented by him to the Geological Society of London. In 1836, the Wollaston Medal was awarded to Agassiz by the council of that society for his work on fossil ichthyology; and, in 1838, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society. Meanwhile, invertebrate animals engaged his attention. In 1837, he issued the \"Prodrome\" of a monograph on the recent and fossil Echinodermata, the first part of which appeared in 1838; in 1839–40, he published two quarto volumes on the fossil Echinoderms of Switzerland; and in 1840–45 he issued his \"Études critiques sur les mollusques fossiles\" (\"Critical Studies on Fossil Mollusks\").\n\nBefore Agassiz's first visit to England in 1834, Hugh Miller and other geologists had brought to light the remarkable fossil fish of the Old Red Sandstone of the northeast of Scotland. The strange forms of the \"Pterichthys\", the \"Coccosteus\" and other genera were then made known to geologists for the first time. They were of intense interest to Agassiz, and formed the subject of a monograph by him published in 1844–45: \"Monographie des poissons fossiles du Vieux Grès Rouge, ou Système Dévonien (Old Red Sandstone) des Îles Britanniques et de Russie\" (\"Monograph on Fossil Fish of the Old Red Sandstone, or Devonian System of the British Isles and of Russia\"). In the early stages of his career in Neuchatel, Agassiz also made a name for himself as a man who could run a scientific department well. Under his care, the University of Neuchâtel soon became a leading institution for scientific inquiry.\n\nIn 1842–1846, Agassiz issued his \"Nomenclator Zoologicus\", a classification list, with references, of all names used in zoological genera and groups.\n\nIn 1837, Agassiz proposed that the Earth had been subjected to a past ice age. He presented the theory to the Helvetic Society that ancient glaciers had not only flowed outward from the Alps, but that even larger glaciers had covered the plains and mountains of Europe, Asia, and North America, smothering the entire northern hemisphere in a prolonged ice age. In the same year, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Prior to this proposal, Goethe, de Saussure, Venetz, Jean de Charpentier, Karl Friedrich Schimper and others had studied the glaciers of the Alps, and Goethe, Charpentier and Schimper had even concluded that the erratic blocks of alpine rocks scattered over the slopes and summits of the Jura Mountains had been moved there by glaciers. These ideas attracted the attention of Agassiz, and he discussed them with Charpentier and Schimper, whom he accompanied on successive trips to the Alps. Agassiz even had a hut constructed upon one of the Aar Glaciers, which for a time he made his home, to investigate the structure and movements of the ice.\n\nIn 1840, Agassiz published a two-volume work entitled \"Études sur les glaciers\" (\"Studies on Glaciers\"). In this, he discussed the movements of the glaciers, their moraines, their influence in grooving and rounding the rocks, and in producing the striations and \"roches moutonnees\" seen in Alpine-style landscapes. He accepted Charpentier's and Schimper's idea that some of the alpine glaciers had extended across the wide plains and valleys of the Aar and Rhône. But he went further, concluding that, in the recent past, Switzerland had been covered with one vast sheet of ice, originating in the higher Alps and extending over the valley of northwestern Switzerland to southern slopes of the Jura. The publication of this work gave fresh impetus to the study of glacial phenomena in all parts of the world.\n\nFamiliar, then, with recent glaciation, Agassiz and the English geologist William Buckland visited the mountains of Scotland in 1840. There they found clear evidence in different locations of glacial action. The discovery was announced to the Geological Society of London in successive communications. The mountainous districts of England, Wales, and Ireland were understood to have been centres for the dispersion of glacial debris. Agassiz remarked \"that great sheets of ice, resembling those now existing in Greenland, once covered all the countries in which unstratified gravel (boulder drift) is found; that this gravel was in general produced by the trituration of the sheets of ice upon the subjacent surface, etc.\"\nWith the aid of a grant of money from the King of Prussia, Agassiz crossed the Atlantic in the autumn of 1846 to investigate the natural history and geology of North America and to deliver a course of lectures on \"The Plan of Creation as shown in the Animal Kingdom,\" by invitation from J. A. Lowell, at the Lowell Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. The financial offers presented to him in the United States induced him to settle there, where he remained to the end of his life. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1846. Agassiz had a cordial relationship with Harvard botanist Asa Gray, but they disagreed on some scientific issues. For example, Agassiz was a member of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia to mimic the autocratic academic structures of European universities, whereas Gray was a staunch opponent of that group. Agassiz also felt each human race had different origins, but Gray believed in the unity of all humans.\n\nAgassiz's engagement for the Lowell Institute lectures precipitated the establishment, in 1847, of the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard University, with Agassiz as its head. Harvard appointed him professor of zoology and geology, and he founded the Museum of Comparative Zoology there in 1859, serving as the museum's first director until his death in 1873. During his tenure at Harvard, Agassiz studied the effect of the last ice age on North America.\n\nAgassiz continued his lectures for the Lowell Institute. In succeeding years, he gave lectures on \"Ichthyology\" (1847–48 season), \"Comparative Embryology\" (1848–49), \"Functions of Life in Lower Animals\" (1850–51), \"Natural History\" (1853–54), \"Methods of Study in Natural History\" (1861–62), \"Glaciers and the Ice Period\" (1864–65), \"Brazil\" (1866–67) and \"Deep Sea Dredging\" (1869–70). In 1850, he married an American college teacher, Elizabeth Cabot Cary, who later wrote introductory books about natural history and a lengthy biography of her husband after he died.\n\nAgassiz served as a non-resident lecturer at Cornell University while also being on faculty at Harvard. In 1852, he accepted a medical professorship of comparative anatomy at Charlestown, Massachusetts, but he resigned in two years. From this time, Agassiz's, scientific studies dropped off, but he became one of the best-known scientists in the world. By 1857, Agassiz was so well-loved that his friend Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote \"The fiftieth birthday of Agassiz\" in his honor, and read it at a dinner given for Agassiz by the Saturday Club in Cambridge. His own writing continued with four (of a planned ten) volumes of \"Natural History of the United States\", published from 1857 to 1862. He also published a catalog of papers in his field, \"Bibliographia Zoologiae et Geologiae\", in four volumes between 1848 and 1854.\n\nStricken by ill health in the 1860s, Agassiz resolved to return to the field for relaxation and to resume his studies of Brazilian fish. In April 1865, he led a party to Brazil. Returning home in August 1866, an account of this expedition, entitled \"A Journey in Brazil\", was published in 1868. In December 1871 he made a second eight-month excursion, known as the \"Hassler\" expedition under the command of Commander Philip Carrigan Johnson (brother of Eastman Johnson), visiting South America on its southern Atlantic and Pacific seaboards. The ship explored the Magellan Strait, which drew the praise of Charles Darwin.\n\nElizabeth Agassiz wrote, at the Strait: '...the Hassler pursued her course, past a seemingly endless panorama of mountains and forests rising into the pale regions of snow and ice, where lay glaciers in which every rift and crevasse, as well as the many cascades flowing down to join the waters beneath, could be counted as she steamed by them... These were weeks of exquisite delight to Agassiz. The vessel often skirted the shore so closely that its geology could be studied from the deck.'\n\nFrom his first marriage to Cecilie Bruan, Agassiz had two daughters in addition to son Alexander.\nIn 1863, Agassiz's daughter Ida married Henry Lee Higginson, who later founded the Boston Symphony Orchestra and was a benefactor to Harvard University and other schools.\nOn November 30, 1860, Agassiz's daughter Pauline was married to Quincy Adams Shaw (1825–1908), a wealthy Boston merchant and later benefactor to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nIn the last years of his life, Agassiz worked to establish a permanent school where zoological science could be pursued amid the living subjects of its study. In 1873, a private philanthropist (John Anderson) gave Agassiz the island of Penikese, in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts (south of New Bedford), and presented him with $50,000 to permanently endow it as a practical school of natural science, especially devoted to the study of marine zoology. The John Anderson school collapsed soon after Agassiz's death; it is considered a precursor of the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory, which is nearby.\n\nAgassiz had a profound influence on the American branches of his two fields, teaching many future scientists that would go on to prominence, including Alpheus Hyatt, David Starr Jordan, Joel Asaph Allen, Joseph Le Conte, Ernest Ingersoll, William James, Nathaniel Shaler, Samuel Hubbard Scudder, Alpheus Packard, and his son Alexander Emanuel Agassiz, among others. He had a profound impact on paleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott and natural scientist Edward S. Morse. Agassiz had a reputation for being a demanding teacher. He would allegedly \"lock a student up in a room full of turtle-shells, or lobster-shells, or oyster-shells, without a book or a word to help him, and not let him out till he had discovered all the truths which the objects contained.\" Two of Agassiz's most prominent students detailed their personal experiences under his tutelage: Scudder, in a short magazine article for Every Saturday, and Shaler, in his \"Autobiography\". These and other recollections were collected and published by Lane Cooper in 1917, which Ezra Pound was to draw on for his anecdote of Agassiz and the sunfish.\n\nIn the early 1840s, Agassiz named two fossil fish species after Mary Anning —\"Acrodus anningiae\", and \"Belenostomus anningiae\"— and another after her friend, Elizabeth Philpot. Anning was a paleontologist known around the world for important finds, but, because of her gender, she was often not formal recognized for her work. Agassiz was grateful for the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834.\n\nAgassiz died in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1873 and was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery, joined later by his wife. His monument is a boulder from a glacial moraine of the Aar near the site of the old , not far from the spot where his hut once stood; his grave is sheltered by pine trees from his old home in Switzerland.\n\nThe Cambridge elementary school north of Harvard University was named in his honor and the surrounding neighborhood became known as \"Agassiz\" as a result. The school's name was changed to the Maria L. Baldwin School on May 21, 2002, due to concerns about Agassiz's alleged racism, and to honor Maria Louise Baldwin the African-American principal of the school who served from 1889 until 1922. The neighborhood, however, continues to be known as Agassiz. An elementary school called the Agassiz Elementary School in Minneapolis, Minnesota existed from 1922–1981.\n\nAn ancient glacial lake that formed in the Great Lakes region of North America, Lake Agassiz, is named after him, as are Mount Agassiz in California's Palisades, Mount Agassiz, in the Uinta Mountains, Agassiz Peak in Arizona and in his native Switzerland, the Agassizhorn in the Bernese Alps. Agassiz Glacier (Montana) and Agassiz Creek in Glacier National Park and Agassiz Glacier (Alaska) in Saint Elias Mountains, Mount Agassiz in Bethlehem, New Hampshire in the White Mountains also bear his name. A crater on Mars \"Crater Agassiz\" and a promontorium on the Moon are also named in his honour. A headland situated in Palmer Land, Antarctica is named in his honor, Cape Agassiz. A main-belt asteroid named 2267 Agassiz is also named in association with Louis Agassiz.\n\nSeveral animal species are named in honor of Louis Agassiz, including \"Apistogramma agassizii\" (Agassiz's dwarf cichlid); \"Isocapnia agassizi\" (a stonefly); \"Publius agassizi\" (a passalid beetle); \"Xylocrius agassizi\" (a longhorn beetle); \"Exoprosopa agassizi\" (a bee fly); \"Chelonia agassizii\" (Galápagos green turtle); \"Philodryas agassizii\" (a South American snake); and the most well-known, \"Gopherus agassizii\" (the desert tortoise).\n\nIn 2005 the EGU Division on Cryospheric Sciences established the Louis Agassiz Medal, awarded to individuals in recognition of their outstanding scientific contribution to the study of the cryosphere on Earth or elsewhere in the solar system.\n\nAgassiz took part in a monthly gathering called the Saturday Club at the Parker House, a meeting of Boston writers and intellectuals. He was therefore mentioned in a stanza of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. poem \"\":\n\n<poem>\nThere, at the table's further end I see\nIn his old place our Poet's vis-à-vis,\nThe great PROFESSOR, strong, broad-shouldered, square,\nIn life's rich noontide, joyous, debonair\n\nHow will her realm be darkened, losing thee,\nHer darling, whom we call our AGASSIZ!\n</poem>\n\nAfter Agassiz came to the United States, he wrote prolifically on polygenism, which holds that animals, plants and humans were all created in \"special provinces\" with distinct populations of species created in and for each province, and that these populations were endowed with unequal attributes. Agassiz denied that migration and adaptation could account for the geographical age or any of the past. Adaptation takes time; in an example, Agassiz questioned how plants or animals could migrate through regions they were not equipped to handle. According to Agassiz the conditions in which particular creatures live \"are the conditions necessary to their maintenance, and what among organized beings is essential to their temporal existence must be at least one of the conditions under which they were created\". Agassiz was opposed to monogenism and evolution, believing that the theory of evolution reduced the wisdom of God to an impersonal materialism. \n\nAgassiz was influenced by philosophical idealism and the scientific work of Georges Cuvier. Agassiz believed there is one species of humans but many different creations of races. These ideas are now included under the rubric of scientific racism. According to Agassiz, genera and species were ideas in the mind of God; their existence in God's mind prior to their physical creation meant that God could create humans as one species yet in several distinct and geographically separate acts of creation. Agassiz was in modern terms a creationist who believed nature had order because God created it directly. Agassiz viewed his career in science as a search for ideas in the mind of the creator expressed in creation. \n\nAgassiz, like other polygenists, believed the Book of Genesis recounted the origin of the white race only and that the animals and plants in the Bible refer only to those species proximate and familiar to Adam and Eve. Agassiz believed that the writers of the Bible only knew of local events, for example Noah's flood was a local event only known to the regions that were populated by ancient Hebrews. Agassiz also believed that the writers of the Bible did not know about any events other than what was going on in their own region and their intermediate neighbors.\n\nStephen Jay Gould asserted that Agassiz's observations sprang from racist bias, in particular from his revulsion on first encountering African-Americans in the United States. However, others have asserted that, despite favoring polygenism, Agassiz rejected racism and believed in a spiritualized human unity. Agassiz believed God made all men equal, and that intellectualism and morality, as developed in civilization, make men equal before God. Agassiz never supported slavery, and claimed his views on polygenism had nothing to do with politics. \n\nAccusations of racism against Agassiz have prompted the renaming of landmarks, schoolhouses, and other institutions (which abound in Massachusetts) that bear his name. Opinions on these events are often mixed, given his extensive scientific legacy in other areas. In 2007, the Swiss government acknowledged the \"racist thinking\" of Agassiz but declined to rename the Agassizhorn summit. In 2017, the Swiss Alpine Club declined to revoke Agassiz's status as a member of honor, which he received in 1865 for his scientific work, because the club considered this status to have lapsed on Agassiz's death.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The festival began in 2009 and spans about ten days during which it is estimated that 10,000–15,000 dogs are consumed. The festival has been criticised by animal welfare and animal rights supporters.\n\nThe tradition of dog meat consumption began over 4,000 years ago in China. Chinese practitioners of folk medicine believe that dog meat would help ward off the heat felt through the summer months. It wasn't until recent years that the festival in Yulin began.\n\nThe festival is celebrated annually in Yulin, Guangxi, China, during the summer solstice in June, by eating dog meat and lychees. About 10,000 to 15,000 dogs are consumed during the 10 days of the festival. This number has decreased to 1,000 in 2015.\nThroughout the 10 days of festivities, dogs are paraded in wooden crates and metal cages and are taken to be skinned and cooked for consumption by festival visitors and local residents. \n\nThe local residents and festival organizers claim that the dogs are killed humanely and that \"eating dog is no different from eating pork or beef\". Animal rights activists and campaigners, however, claim that the animals are \"treated cruelly\", based on photographs of the event. Many dogs suffer before being killed, there are videos of dogs being beaten to death with metal bars, skinned alive, boiled alive and suffer many diseases. A witness claimed that some of the dogs eaten appeared to be stolen household pets, judging by their collars.\n\nA retired school teacher, Yang Xiaoyun, paid ¥150,000 to rescue 360 dogs and dozens of cats from the festival in 2014, and ¥7,000 to rescue 100 dogs in 2015. She was later accused by animal welfare advocates of fraud and animal abuse. However it has been discovered that these rumours were started by a UK charity to withhold the £100,000 plus they had collected in donations using her name.\n\nIn 2016, 1,000 dogs were rescued from the festival; the previous week 34 animals (21 dogs, eight puppies, and five cats and kittens) were rescued from a slaughter facility in Yulin by Humane Society International.\n\nIn 2017, over 1,300 dogs were rescued by an organization called \"No Dog Left Behind\". After a tip, a truck transporting the dogs was blocked. Police confirmed that the majority of the dogs were stolen and not allowed for consumption, allowing volunteers to rescue the dogs. 40% of dogs also carried infectious diseases.\n\nMillions of Chinese voted in support of a legislative proposal by Zhen Xiaohe, a deputy to the National People’s Congress of China, to ban the dog meat trade. Chinese celebrities such as Fan Bingbing, Chen Kun, Sun Li and Yang Mi have publicly expressed a distaste for the festival.\n\nIn a 2014 statement released to Xinhua, Yulin's local government denies any official involvement or endorsement of the festival itself, and describes the event as a local custom observed by \"a small percentage\" of Yulin's residents. They attribute the branding of the event to local businesses and residents.\n\nAn editorial published by the \"People's Daily\" expressed the view that while activists understand dogs as \"companion animals\", neither the Chinese legal system nor the current Chinese public recognizes them with this special status. While noting the \"duality\" of dogs as both companions and food items, the editorial urges restraint in handling the issue and calls mutual understanding from both organizers and activists in reaching a respectful compromise.\n\nAn editorial published by \"Global Times\" strongly criticized what the writer believed to be the Western obsession over the treatment of dogs, and cited bullfighting as an example of animal cruelty to which the West has turned a blind eye. He further categorised the controversy as a part of a Western campaign against China, and dismissed criticism and protests as \"non-noteworthy\".\n\nCampaigns have had a significant impact on spreading awareness of the festival around the globe. Many activists and public figures take to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and have created hashtags such as \"#stopyulinforever\", \"#stopyulin2015\", and \"#stopyulin2016\" to spread the word. Because of the social media campaigns, the number of dogs slaughtered has steadily decreased since 2013 to 1,000 in 2016.\n\nAn article in Time said that, \"the festival is more than an animal rights issue. It is a public health concern.\"\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, professor Peter J. Li of the University of Houston–Downtown said in response to the claim that dog meat promoters accused Chinese activists of introducing a harmful Western ideology into China that opposition to eating dog meat at the festival began with the Chinese themselves, as \"the bond between companion animals and humans is not Western. It's a transcultural phenomenon\".\n\nThe director of Animal Protection and Crisis Response for Humane Society International explained in an article on CNN the reasons for his opposition to the festival and called on the Yulin government to cancel the festival.\n\nAn article in 2016 that was written by the BBC noted that the dog meat festival began in China amid widespread criticism, saying, \"Activists say the event is cruel, and this year a petition calling for it to be banned collected 11 million signatures.\"\n\nAn article in \"The Guardian\" by Jill Robinson said that the dog meat trade is \"steeped in illegality\" and the reason why dogs are special and deserve kind treatment is because \"they are friends and helpers of humankind.\" Another article by Julian Baggini that was published in the same news outlet said that what should be most appalling about the festival \"is not which particular animal is being killed, but that too many animals in the West are treated nearly or just as cruelly\" and that \"vegans are the only group who can oppose the festival without any fear of hypocrisy\".\n\nAn article in \"The Independent\" encouraged protests against the festival but also compared the festival with the 1.9 million animals \"brutally slaughtered\" in the UK every month and noted that \"the western distinction between dogs and farm animals is completely arbitrary\".\n\nThe outrage on social media over the 2014 festival was unprecedented.\n\nIn June 2015, an online petition against the festival was started in the United Kingdom, gathering over 4 million signatures. In 2016 Humane Society International organised a petition in opposition to the dog eating festival which was signed by 11 million people worldwide.\n\nU.S. Representative Alcee Hastings introduced, alongside 27 original cosponsors, a bipartisan resolution (House Resolution 752) in 2016 which condemned the annual festival in Yulin and called on the Chinese government to prohibit the dog meat trade outright. The resolution was supported the Humane Society of the United States, Humane Society Legislative Fund, and Humane Society International. In 2017, Hastings reintroduced, alongside 49 original co-sponsors, his 2016 bipartisan resolution through House Resolution 30.\n\nThe festival has also been condemned in an Early Day Motion signed by Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the UK Labour Party.\n\nCelebrities including Ken Todd, Lisa Vanderpump, Ricky Gervais, George Lopez, Ian Somerhalder, Leona Lewis, Lori Alan, Tom Kenny, and Rob Zombie have publicly expressed a distaste for the festival.\n\nIn October 2015, a protest march organized by TV personalities Lisa Vanderpump and Sharon Osbourne took place from MacArthur Park to the Chinese Consulate General in Los Angeles.\n\nPink Guy made a song about the festival called \"Dog Festival Directions\". Although this was removed along with ‘White Is Right’ in the YouTube reupload and official release. It appears on the 2017 album Pink Season.\n\n"}
{"id": "7073526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7073526", "title": "Management of Pacific Northwest riparian forests", "text": "Management of Pacific Northwest riparian forests\n\nManagement of Pacific Northwest riparian forests is necessary because many of these forests have been dramatically changed from their original makeup. The primary interest in riparian forest and aquatic ecosystems under the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) is the need to restore stream habitat for fish populations, particularly \"Anadromous salmonids\". Some of these forests have been grazed by cattle or other livestock. The heavy hooves of these animals compact the soil. This compaction doesn’t allow the water to be absorbed into the ground, so the water runs off into the stream carrying top soil along the way.\nThe simplification of the stream itself has also had negative effects. The large woody debris in the streams has been removed to allow for easy access to the stream and for better travel in the streams themselves. But the faster moving current erodes the stream banks filling the stream with more sediment. The removal of trees on the stream banks also leads to erosion and stream degradation. Another effect of the removal of trees is an increase in stream temperatures because the lack of shade. \nThese changes to riparian forests can be fixed through three steps; \n\nThese steps will help restore riparian forest ecosystems which will directly help the salmon populations.\n\nThe following steps used to help restore and maintain healthy riparian forests came from the Bureau of Land Management’s best management practices (BMPs) in the Roseburg District. The first step towards riparian forest restoration should be the establishment of riparian reserves. The second step is to restore channel complexity. The third step is to apply silvicultural treatments to restore large conifers. The large conifer species would be western red cedar Thuja plicata and western hemlock Tsuga heterophylla. These three steps will help direct the ecosystem back to its pre-disturbed state.\n\nThe riparian reserve is the designated width from the stream where restrictions on what can be done are placed in order to protect the functions of the land and water in that reserved area. There are three different riparian reserve widths: \nSome activities that are restricted or limited in the riparian reserve include:\n\nThe placement of large woody debris (LWD) in streams creates pools and side channels. The pools provide habitat for aquatic organisms while the side channels help alleviate flooding. The LWD also controls the routing of sedimentation. The source of the LWD should be outside of the riparian reserve whenever possible so as not to promote erosion in the riparian reserve. However, if usable trees are generated during management, then they can be used to add LWD. Any trees that naturally fall in the stream are an advantage and should be left.\n\nThere are three silvicultural techniques that will help restore large conifers (western red cedar & western hemlock) in riparian forests. Since silviculture is a cyclical process, the numbering of the techniques doesn’t denote the order in which these operations should begin or the importance of the step.\n\nThe role of site preparation is to modify current growing vegetative conditions making the site suitable for the desired seedlings. Western red cedar and western hemlock are the desired seedlings. The goals of site preparation in this case are: \nMechanical site preparation will be difficult Because of the heavy equipment’s size, and inability to maneuver in the small spaces left by single tree selection. Prescribed burning is another method of site preparation, but will not work because the shallow roots of western hemlock would get damaged, hurting the seed sources. Prescribed burning would also damage the thin bark of both western hemlock and red cedar girdling the trees. Chemical applications are restricted in the riparian reserves because of the danger of runoff or leaching of chemicals into the stream. So the methods that will be used for site preparation are: \nThe passive site preparation will entail keeping the debris created by naturally falling trees where they land. Keeping the slash and smaller trees that are generated by tree selections on the ground is another passive site preparation that will work well within the riparian forest. This will supply a good rotting seed bed for both Western Redcedar and Western Hemlock. Both species also can use disturbed mineral seed beds for regeneration from seed. To obtain disturbed mineral soil in the small areas that single tree selection creates manually turning up the soil with hand tools or small tillers is the manual site preparation option.\n\nSeeding is done following site preparation. Seeding is one way to ensure the survival of the desired species on a site. With seeding, foresters have control of genetic make up of the species and the source of the seed. \nNatural regeneration may be obtained because of the high numbers of annual seed crops (100,000-1 million/acre). Where annual seed production is low western red cedar can be direct seeded in the fall if the soil moisture is adequate. High numbers of seeds will be needed to reach desired stocking level. Containerized stocking also works well. In the coastal ranges, 2-year-old bare-root stock seems to be most efficient. Containerized stock plantings in the spring perform better than bare-root stock in the interior. \nWestern hemlock has a good rate of survival on a wide range of conditions. This will allow for natural regeneration on sites that have good organic or mineral soil. If the site is not suitable for natural regeneration then the use of container-grown stock should be used. Hemlock doesn’t survive well with the bare-root stock method.\nBoth western red cedar and western hemlock are able to reproduce by some form of vegetative reproduction. Western red cedar reproduces in three ways of vegetative form; layering, rooting of fallen branches, and branch development on fallen trees. In some areas of the Cascades this form of regeneration is the most successful. Another option for the establishment of red cedar is the use of stem cuttings. Western hemlock also has vegetative reproduction capabilities. Hemlock can be propagated by layering and from cuttings.\n\nSingle-tree selection harvest method works best within the riparian ecosystem. Single-tree selection is a good method to keep the western hemlock and western red cedar on the site. If the stand was left alone and the forest naturally created gaps for succession then other species that are less tolerant than the desired tree species of western red cedar and western hemlock could overtake the created gaps. Single tree selection will contribute minimally to erosion, still provide habitat for wildlife, be aesthetically pleasing to the eye, and follow the best management practices (BMPs) that are associated with riparian forests. Single tree selection gives the forest a great vertical distribution of foliage. The last reason for doing a single tree selection is that it spreads out income over longer period of time. This could help pay for any costs associated with the stand’s management. \nSingle tree selection replicates the natural process called gap-phase. Gap-phase is an event that happens in a forest when a tree in the upper canopy of the forest falls down, usually form a strong wind. The gap formed in the upper canopy allows enough sunlight to come through the opening and reach saplings at the forest floor. These saplings can grow and eventually penetrate the canopy. The natural gap-phase process may only open the total stand by 1 percent. Single tee selection is different from the natural process because the openings are created more often. Since both species are tolerant an opening of the stand by 10 percent each cutting cycle would be enough for stand to do well. An uneven aged forest is the result of periodically opening the canopy.\n\nSince both Western Hemlock and Western Redcedar are shade tolerant species, a basal area of is recommended and would be the maximum basal area the stand could support. The q-factor for these species is 1.2 because of their tolerance. So the number of trees in the size class would be 7 trees. A cutting cycle of 20 years is recommended to ensure the stand is following the ideal stocking curve for western red cedar and western hemlock.\n\nWestern Redcedar can tolerate mixed species conditions in the under story and is often over topped by species such as Douglas-fir, Western White Pine and Western Hemlock (Minore, 1990). Western Hemlock responds well to release after long periods of suppression. After 50 to 60 years the advanced regeneration will grow vigorously after over story removal (Packee, 1990). The single-tree selection works well with these growth characteristics of both species.\n\n\n"}

The Samnites occupied central Italy before the rise of Rome. Mefitis was worshipped in central and southern Italy before Roman times, with her main shrine in the volcano Ampsanctus in Samnium. There was a temple dedicated to her in Cremona, and another on the Esquiline Hill in Rome. It is theorized that Mefitis was originally a goddess of underground sources, such as natural springs—the fact that many of these springs were sulfurous led to her association with noxious gases. She is almost always identified with volcanoes, having been worshipped at Pompeii. Her name, which likely means \"one who smokes in the middle\", is also seen as Mephitis.\n\nThe etymology of the name \"Mefitis\" is controversial but according to the Italian linguist Alberto Manco the system of the epithets that identified the goddess from place to place would prove her relationship with a water-based dimension.\n\nIn Roman mythology, Mefitis (or Mephitis; Mefite in Italian) was the Minor Goddess of the poisonous gases emitted from the ground in swamps and volcanic vapors.\n\"Mephitic\", derived from \"Mefitis\", is now an adjective in the English language meaning \"offensive in odour\"; \"noxious\"; and \"poisonous\".\n\nIn Italian, a mefite is also a \"solfatara\" or fumarole (i.e., a gaseous fissure) associated with the Roman goddess \"Mefitis\". The feature giving rise to this term is located in Italy along the Via Appia between Rome and Brindisi. There, the ancient Romans would rest on their travels and pay homage to the goddess by performing animal sacrifices using the fissure's deadly gases. Today, it lies near the village of Rocca San Felice in the province of Avellino (Campania region).\n\n\n"}

It was in a garden dedicated to Muhammad's daughter Fatimah. The fruit from the tree was being sold to pilgrims and its leaves used for washing dead bodies.\n\nThe Sidrat al-Muntahā (usually transcribed as \"Sadratu'l-Muntahá\" in Bahá'í writings; see Bahá'í orthography) is a metaphor for the Manifestation of God.\n\nThe Sidrat al-Muntaha is sometimes named in the short form as \"Sidra tree\".

The saltwater naturally forms a vertical salinity gradient also known as a \"halocline\", in which low-salinity water floats on top of high-salinity water. The layers of salt solutions increase in concentration (and therefore density) with depth. Below a certain depth, the solution has a uniformly high salt concentration.\n\nWhen the sun's rays contact the bottom of a shallow pool, they heat the water adjacent to the bottom. When water at the bottom of the pool is heated, it becomes less dense than the cooler water above it, and convection begins. Solar ponds heat water by impeding this convection. Salt is added to the water until the lower layers of water become completely saturated. High-salinity water at the bottom of the pond does not mix readily with the low-salinity water above it, so when the bottom layer of water is heated, convection occurs separately in the bottom and top layers, with only mild mixing between the two. This greatly reduces heat loss, and allows for the high-salinity water to get up to 90 °C while maintaining 30 °C low-salinity water. This hot, salty water can then be pumped away for use in electricity generation, through a turbine or as a source of thermal energy.\n\n\nThe energy obtained is in the form of low-grade heat of 70 to 80 °C compared to an assumed 20 °C ambient temperature. According to the second law of thermodynamics (see Carnot-cycle), the maximum theoretical efficiency of a cycle that uses heat from a high temperature reservoir at 80 °C and has a lower temperature of 20 °C is 1−(273+20)/(273+80)=17%. By comparison, a power plant's heat engine delivering high-grade heat at 800 °C would have a maximum theoretical limit of 73% for converting heat into useful work (and thus would be forced to divest as little as 27% in waste heat to the cold temperature reservoir at 20 °C). The low efficiency of solar ponds is usually justified with the argument that the 'collector', being just a plastic-lined pond, might potentially result in a large-scale system that is of lower overall levelised energy cost than a solar concentrating system.\n\nFurther research is aimed at addressing the problems, such as the development of membrane ponds. These use a thin permeable membrane to separate the layers without allowing salt to pass through.\n\nThe largest operating solar pond for electricity generation was the Beit HaArava pond built in Israel and operated up until 1988. It had an area of 210,000 m² and gave an electrical output of 5 MW.\n\nIndia was the first Asian country to have established a solar pond in Bhuj, in Gujarat. The project was sanctioned under the National Solar Pond Programme by the Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources in 1987 and completed in 1993 after a sustained collaborative effort by TERI, the Gujarat Energy Development Agency, and the GDDC (Gujarat Dairy Development Corporation Ltd). The solar pond successfully demonstrated the expediency of the technology by supplying 80,000 litres of hot water daily to the plant.It is designed to supply about 22,000,000 kWh of Thermal Energy annually . The Energy and Resources Institute provided all technical inputs and took up the complete execution of research, development, and demonstration. TERI operated and maintained this facility until 1996 before handing it over to the GDDC. The solar pond functioned effortlessly till the year 2000 when severe financial losses crippled GDDC. Subsequently, the Bhuj earthquake left the Kutch Dairy non-functional.\n\nThe solar pond powering 20% of Bruce Foods Corporation's operations in El Paso, Texas is the second largest in the U.S. It is also the first ever salt-gradient solar pond in the U.S.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1252913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1252913", "title": "Thermionic converter", "text": "Thermionic converter\n\nA thermionic converter consists of a hot electrode which thermionically emits electrons over a potential energy barrier to a cooler electrode, producing a useful electric power output. Caesium vapor is used to optimize the electrode work functions and provide an ion supply (by surface ionization or electron impact ionization in a plasma) to neutralize the electron space charge.\n\nFrom a physical electronic viewpoint, thermionic energy conversion is the direct production of electric power from heat by thermionic electron emission. From a thermodynamic viewpoint, it is the use of electron vapor as the working fluid in a power-producing cycle. A thermionic converter consists of a hot emitter electrode from which electrons are vaporized by thermionic emission and a colder collector electrode into which they are condensed after conduction through the interelectrode plasma. The resulting current, typically several amperes per square centimetre of emitter surface, delivers electrical power to a load at a typical potential difference of 0.5–1 volt and thermal efficiency of 5–20%, depending on the emitter temperature (1500–2000 K) and mode of operation.\n\nAfter the first demonstration of the practical arc-mode caesium vapor thermionic converter by V. Wilson in 1957, several applications of it were demonstrated in the following decade, including its use with solar, combustion, radioisotope and nuclear reactor heat sources. The application most seriously pursued, however, was the integration of thermionic nuclear fuel elements directly into the core of nuclear reactors for production of electrical power in space.\nThe exceptionally high operating temperature of thermionic converters, which makes their practical use difficult in other applications, gives the thermionic converter decisive advantages over competing energy conversion technologies in the space power application where radiant heat rejection is required. Substantial thermionic space reactor development programs were conducted in the U.S., France and Germany in the period 1963–1973, and the US resumed a significant thermionic nuclear fuel element development program in the period 1983–1993.\n\nThermionic power systems were used in combination with various nuclear reactors (BES-5, TOPAZ) as electrical power supply on a number of Soviet military surveillance satellites between 1967 and 1988.\nSee Kosmos 954 for more details.\n\nAlthough the priority for thermionic reactor use diminished as the US and Russian space programs were curtailed, research and technology development in thermionic energy conversion have continued. In recent years technology development programs for solar-heated thermionic space power systems were conducted. Prototype combustion-heated thermionic systems for domestic heat and electric power cogeneration, and for rectification, have been developed.\n\nThe scientific aspects of thermionic energy conversion primarily concern the fields of surface physics and plasma physics. The electrode surface properties determine the magnitude of electron emission current and electric potential at the electrode surfaces, and the plasma properties determine the transport of electron current from the emitter to the collector. All practical thermionic converters to date employ caesium vapor between the electrodes, which determines both the surface and plasma properties. Caesium is employed because it is the most easily ionized of all stable elements.\n\nThe surface property of primary interest is the work function, which is the barrier that limits electron emission current from the surface and essentially is the heat of vaporization of electrons from the surface. The work function is determined primarily by a layer of caesium atoms adsorbed on the electrode surfaces. The properties of the interelectrode plasma are determined by the mode of operation of the thermionic converter. In the ignited (or “arc”) mode the plasma is maintained via ionization internally by hot plasma electrons (~ 3300 K); in the unignited mode the plasma is maintained via injection of externally produced positive ions into a cold plasma; in the hybrid mode the plasma is maintained by ions from a hot-plasma interelectrode region transferred into a cold-plasma interelectrode region.\n\nAll the applications cited above have employed technology in which the basic physical understanding and performance of the thermionic converter were essentially the same as those achieved before 1970. During the period from 1973 to 1983, however, significant research on advanced low-temperature thermionic converter technology for fossil-fueled industrial and commercial electric power production was conducted in the US, and continued until 1995 for possible space reactor and naval reactor applications. That research has shown that substantial improvements in converter performance can be obtained now at lower operating temperatures by addition of oxygen to the caesium vapor, by suppression of electron reflection at the electrode surfaces, and by hybrid mode operation. Similarly, improvements via use of oxygen-containing electrodes have been demonstrated in Russia along with design studies of systems employing the advanced thermionic converter performance.\nRecent studies have shown that excited Cs-atoms in thermionic converters form clusters of Cs-Rydberg matter which yield a decrease of collector emitting work function from 1.5 eV to 1.0 – 0.7 eV. Due to long-lived nature of Rydberg matter this low work function remains low for a long time which essentially increases the low-temperature converter’s efficiency.\n\n"}
