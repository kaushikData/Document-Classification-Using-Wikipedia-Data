{"id": "5540574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5540574", "title": "Atlas of Australian Birds", "text": "Atlas of Australian Birds\n\nThe Atlas of Australian Birds is a major ongoing database project initiated and managed by BirdLife Australia (formerly the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union) to map the distribution of Australia's bird species. BirdLife Australia is a not-for-profit bird research and conservation organisation.\n\nThere have been other bird atlasses produced for various countries and islands around the world, but the Australian project was the first to cover an entire continent. Volunteers collected data on Australian birds in order to establish a database and publish a book, \"The Atlas of Australian Birds\" (1984), summarising the findings. A second period of fieldwork nearly 20 years later resulted in the publication of a second book, \"The New Atlas of Australian Birds\", in 2002. However, the Atlas is an ongoing project.\n\nThe idea of an Australian bird atlas based on data collected by volunteer observers (atlassers) was first mooted in 1972. Because of the daunting scale of the task, however, to test feasibility, a pilot atlas was carried out on the southern coast of New South Wales from March 1973 to September 1974 with 168 volunteers covering an area of 13,600 square kilometres. In August 1974, the 16th International Ornithological Congress was held in Canberra, providing an opportunity for discussions with other ornithologists involved in atlas schemes outside Australia, leading to a decision to proceed.\n\nIt was recognised that, although the fieldwork would be carried out by volunteers, some funding for project management was required. In February 1976 the RAOU received a grant from the Australian Government enabling the appointment of a full-time staff member whose first task was to search existing ornithological literature for records suitable for a complementary Historical Atlas. Further discussions in 1976 produced decisions about how the main atlas project would be structured and organised.\n\nMethodology was kept simple: atlassers used maps to determine or locate a one degree grid square and then recorded all species of birds seen within it. Date, location and species data were recorded on survey sheets and later entered by hand on a computer database. Fieldwork began on 1 January 1977 and ended five years later on 31 December 1981. Data were received from every single one-degree block of the Australian continent, Tasmania and adjacent islands, with 3000 atlassers completing 90,000 survey sheets producing 2.7 million records (sightings) of 716 bird species. During the course of the Atlas fieldwork period, the Chair of the RAOU's Atlas Committee was Pauline Reilly and the project manager Margaret Blakers. In 1984 a book was published of the results.\n\nIn 1987 a spin-off book, the \"Atlas of Victorian Birds\", was published jointly by the RAOU and the Victorian Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands, covering only the state of Victoria but at a higher (10-minute) resolution and with more detail on reporting rates and seasonal variations.\n\nSome 20 years after the commencement of fieldwork for the first Atlas, in 1997, Birds Australia began negotiations with Environment Australia towards obtaining funding for a new atlas project. In 1998, a grant from the Natural Heritage Trust's Bushcare and Wetlands programs was approved.\n\nFieldwork began in August 1998 and has continued since, though after about four years there was a funding cut-off as well as a deadline for book publication purposes late in 2002. Methodology was based on that of the first Atlas but improved by the use of GPS receivers and scannable survey sheets. During the four-year period over 7,000 atlassers completed 279,000 surveys, producing 4.7 million records of 772 bird species. Coverage was greater than the first Atlas since, as well as the Australian continent and major islands, the second Atlas included records from Australia's territorial waters and the external territories of Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Norfolk Island. As with the first Atlas, the results have been published as a book, \"The New Atlas of Australian Birds\"\n\nThe Atlas is now in its ongoing phase and is now accepting electronic survey forms via the Birdata website. Analysis of Atlas data is published by BirdLife Australia in the report series.\n\nBetween the end of the five-year data collection of the first Atlas, and the beginning of fieldwork for the second Atlas, very little atlassing took place at a national level. However, since the end of the cut-off period for the inclusion of data in the second Atlas book, atlassing has continued. The database contains not only the complete dataset on which the two hard-copy atlasses were published, but much additional material gathered since. Because of this, Birds Australia claims that the Atlas database is \"one of the most important environmental databases in the world\".\n\nThe stated aims of the Atlas of Australian Birds project were to:\n\nThe success of the project prompted the launch of a number of similar projects, one notable example being \"The Banksia Atlas\", a distribution atlas of \"Banksia\" species that greatly increased knowledge of \"Banksia\" species distributions and habitat, and even resulted in the discovery of two new species.\n\n\n"}

Built by Orbital Sciences Corporation, it was launched by Ariane 5 into orbit on February 7, 2013 from Kourou in French Guiana at orbital positions 46° east. The satellite covers Europe and a significant part of Asia and Africa. It is operated by the Azerbaijani company Azercosmos and has transmission capabilities for TV, radio broadcasting and the internet.\n\nThe satellite has an anticipated service life of 15 years.\n\nIt is believed that the satellite cost of US$ 120 million and was established by Orbital Sciences Corporation. Arianespace’s president Jean-Yves Le Gall emphasized that the weight of the satellite would be three tonnes. In April 2011, Export-Import Bank of the United States has approved financing of this project as 85 percent of construction cost which will be provided to the Azerbaijani side in the form of a loan, while the remaining 15 percent will be paid by state funds. The funds will be issued to Azercosmos OJSC.\n\nThe satellite has solar arrays with four panels per array, using UTJ Gallium Arsenide cells. It will be stabilized with a 3-axis stabilized, zero momentum system. It will have a liquid bi-propellant transfer orbit system, with a monopropellant (hydrazine) on-orbit system. Power will be held in two Li-Ion batteries with a capacity of >4840 W/hr.\n\nAzerspace-1/Africasat-1A has a hybrid payload including both C- band and Ku-band antennae. There will be 24 active C-band transponders, using a single shell super-elliptical deployable reflector, with a single shell super-elliptical deck-mounted reflector. There will also be 12 active Ku-band transponders, using a single shell super-elliptical deployable reflector.\n\nThe Ku-band transponders (11.2 GHz and 14.0 GHz) have a contour map that primarily covers Europe and Central Asia. The C-band contour map (3740 MHz and 5965 MHz) also covers Europe and Central Asia, as well as nearly all of Africa.\n\nThe satellite based on Orbital’s flight-proven STAR-2 platform and generates approximately five kilowatts of payload power for 36 active transponders. Upon completion of in-orbit testing, operational control of the satellite was handed over to Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Communications and IT, and since October, 2017 Azercosmos OJSCo controls Azerspace-1 independently. \n\nThe satellite's operations are controlled by a state-run company, Azercosmos, owned by the Government of Azerbaijan Azerspace-1/Africasat-1A is a joint venture between Azerbaijan and satellite fleet operator MEASAT Satellite Systems of Malaysia, which owns the rights to the orbital slot at 46 degrees east longitude, and which will be using about 40 percent of the satellite’s total capacity. Azerbaijan uses 20 percent, with the remaining capacity to be available for other customers.\n\nAs of 2014, satellite carries 13 radio stations and 128 television channels, mostly free to air, in addition to its services to the government. As of 2018, the satellite carries around 100 TV and radio channels, mostly free to air, in addition to its services to the government.\n\nThe launch of its own satellite inaugurated Azerbaijan's space industry. In April 2011, deputy director of the Azerbaijan National Aerospace Agency Tofig Suleymanov hinted that Azerbaijan had plans to launch a second satellite to study the Earth's interior and atmosphere in 2014. On 26 November 2011, the head of Azercosmos, Rashad Nabiyev, reported that the launch of the second satellite was expected to occur in 2015.\n\nAzercosmos was launched second telecommunication satellite, Azerspace-2, in 25 September 2018 by 22:38 by UTC, to provide broadband and broadcast services to customers in Europe, the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Central and South Asia. The new satellite is equipped with 35 transponders in Ku-band, and will be located at 45° East longitude. The lifespan of Azerspace-2 is expected to be 15 years.\n\n\n"}

The term has been in use since at least as early as 1958 and Bark Mitzvahs are sometimes held as an adjunct to the festival of Purim for fun.\n\nThe Bark Mitzvah is a celebration not necessarily held in conjunction with a specific age but can occur when the dog turns 13 months or 13 years of age. During some Bark Mitzvahs, dogs wear a tallit, a ritual prayer shawl worn during Jewish religious services and ceremonies. A male dog wears a specific yarmulke, a thin skullcap.\n\nThe first recorded Bark Mitzvah took place in Beverly Hills California in 1958. According to the \"Beverly Hills Courier\", Max and Janet Salter celebrated the coming of age of their black cocker spaniel Duke of Windsor (Windy for short). Janet coined the term \"Bark Mitzvah\" on the invitations. Over the next 50 years, Max and Janet threw several more Bark Mitzvahs whenever one of their dogs turned 13. \n\nIn 1997, the first widely recorded Bark Mitzvah was celebrated, receiving scrutiny and disapproval from several rabbis. One rabbi expressed his distaste for Bark Mitzvahs in a letter to the editor of \"The New York Times,\" describing the celebration as \"nothing less than a desecration of a cherished Jewish tradition\" and claiming that Bark Mitzvahs \"degrade some of the central principles of Jewish life\".\n\nAlthough the idea of the Bark Mitzvah is frowned upon by some, the idea spread throughout the United States, and the celebrations have continued to occur. The ceremonies became increasingly popular on the East and West Coasts in the early 2000s. As a result, specialty pet stores and dog bakeries now offer special Bark Mitzvah party packages, party favors, and gifts.\n\n\nMark Nadler, a New York cabaret singer, hired party planners and bartenders to ensure a special evening for Admiral Boom. The event was complete with a Bark Mitzvah cake displaying Boom's photograph and his name written in English and Hebrew, satin yarmulkes with Boom's name and date printed inside, and a full buffet. Mark Nadler requested that as a Bark Mitzvah gift to Boom, guests make a donation to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Coverage of the celebration was featured in \"The New York Times\".\n\n\nEdie and Ed Rudy celebrated Columbo Rudy's coming of age at a local, outdoor Aventura café. Rabbi Rex Doberman signed a certificate from Congregation Beth Poodle congratulating the canine. Coverage of the event was featured on MSNBC.\n\n\nDavid Best, CEO of MDea and \"The Doctor's Channel\", hosted this celebration at Sammy's Roumanian, a famous Jewish steakhouse. The event featured live music, traditional Jewish cuisine, and various speeches given by Elvis Best himself. In attendance were representatives from various US pharmaceutical companies. As a result, the celebration served as the event of the season in the pharmaceutical industry. Sex therapist Dr. Ruth also helped Elvis celebrate his big day. Coverage of the event was available on \"YouTube\", \"The Doctor's Channel\", and \"AOL\".\n\nThe term is also used for a dog-assisted literacy education project, one of several \"bark mitzva\" projects designed by a Lawrenceville, New Jersey conservative synagogue's religious school to teach children about \"tzedaka\", the Jewish practice of charity.\n\n\n"}

Colonel Denning State Park is surrounded by Tuscarora State Forest.\n\nColonel Denning State Park is named in honor of William Denning who was, oddly, never a colonel. He was a veteran of the American Revolutionary War and a manufacturer of wrought iron cannons. Denning was a sergeant in the Continental Army from March 1778 until April 1780. He was stationed near Carlisle at Washingtonburg Forge, now the Carlisle Barracks. While stationed there, Denning explored and mastered the technique of creating lighter and easier to transport cannons. He did this by welding strips of wrought iron together in layers and building the cannon with the layers. Denning lived out his life following the Revolution near Newville. His grave can be found in the cemetery of Big Spring Presbyterian Church in Newville.\n\nMany of the facilities at Colonel Denning State Park were constructed during the Great Depression in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. It was formally opened in 1936.\n\nColonel Denning State Park is open to hunting. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are squirrels, white-tailed deer, and turkeys. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited. Hunting is also permitted in the nearby Tuscarora State Forest.

Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than are classified as shallow-focus earthquakes, while those with a focal depth between and are commonly termed mid-focus or intermediate-depth earthquakes. In subduction zones, where older and colder oceanic crust descends beneath another tectonic plate, deep-focus earthquakes may occur at much greater depths in the mantle, ranging from up to .\n\nThe cause of deep-focus earthquakes is still not entirely understood since subducted lithosphere at that pressure and temperature regime should not exhibit brittle behavior. A possible mechanism for the generation of deep-focus earthquakes is faulting caused by olivine undergoing a phase transition into a spinel structure, with which they are believed to be associated. Earthquakes at this depth of focus typically occur at oceanic-continental convergent boundaries, along Wadati–Benioff zones.\n\nThe evidence for deep-focus earthquakes was discovered in 1922 by H.H. Turner of Oxford, England. Previously, all earthquakes were considered to have shallow focal depths. The existence of deep-focus earthquakes was confirmed in 1931 from studies of the seismograms of several earthquakes, which in turn led to the construction of travel-time curves for intermediate and deep earthquakes.\n\n"}

{"id": "55742877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55742877", "title": "Droplet cluster", "text": "Droplet cluster\n\nDroplet cluster is a self-assembled levitating monolayer of microdroplets usually arranged into a hexagonally ordered structure over a locally heated thin (about 1 mm) layer of water. The droplet cluster is typologically similar to colloidal crystals. The phenomenon was observed for the first time in 2004, and it has been extensively studied after that.\n\nGrowing condensing droplets with a typical diameter of 0.01 mm – 0.2 mm levitate at an equilibrium height, where their weight is equilibrated by the drag force of the ascending air-vapor jet rising over the heated spot. At the same time, the droplets are dragged towards the center of the heated spot; however, they do not merge forming an ordered hexagonal (densest packed) pattern due to an aerodynamic repulsive pressure force from gas flow between the droplets. The spot is usually heated by a laser beam or another source of heat to 60 °C – 95 °C, although the phenomenon was observed also at temperatures slightly above 20 °C. The height of levitation and the distance between the droplets are of the same order as their diameters.\nDue to complex nature of aerodynamic forces between the microdroplets in an ascending jet, the droplets do not coalesce but form a closed packed hexagonal structure showing similarity with various classical and newly discovered objects, where self-organization is prominent, including water breath figures, colloid and dust crystals, foams, Rayleigh–Bénard cells, and to some extent, ice crystals. The droplets pack near the center of heated area where the temperature and the intensity of the ascending vapor jets are the highest. At the same time, there are repulsion forces of aerodynamic nature between the droplets. Consequently, the cluster packs itself in the densest packing shape (a hexagonal honeycomb structure) with a certain distance between the droplets dependent on the repulsion forces.\n\nBy controlling the temperature and temperature gradient one can control the number of droplets and their density and size. Using infrared irradiation, it is possible to suppress droplet growth and stabilize them for extended periods of time.\n\nIt has been suggested that the phenomenon, when combined with a spectrographic study of droplets content, can be used for rapid biochemical in situ analysis. Recent studies have shown that the cluster can exist at lower temperatures of about 20 °C, which makes it suitable for biochemical analysis of living objects.\n\nClusters with an arbitrary small number of droplets can be created. Unlike the clusters with a large number of droplets, small clusters cannot always form a hexagonally symmetric structure. Instead, they produce various more or less symmetric configurations depending on the number of droplets. Tracing individual droplets in small clusters is crucial for potential applications. The symmetry, orderliness, and stability of these configurations can be studied with such a measure of self-organization as the Voronoi entropy.\n\nThe phenomenon of the droplet cluster is different from the Leidenfrost effect because the latter occurs at much higher temperatures over a solid surface, while the droplet cluster forms at lower temperatures over a liquid surface. The phenomenon has also been observed with liquids other than water.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1440257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1440257", "title": "Dunnage", "text": "Dunnage\n\nIn the technical sense treated here, dunnage is inexpensive or waste material used to load and secure cargo during transportation; more loosely, it refers to miscellaneous baggage, brought along during travel. The term can also refer to low-priority cargo used to fill out transport capacity which would otherwise ship underweight.\n\nWhen unloading a ship, sometimes there is a problem as to what to do with the dunnage. Sometimes the dunnage cannot be landed because of customs duties on imported timber, or quarantine rules to avoid foreign insect pests getting offshore, and as a result often the unwanted dunnage is later furtively jettisoned overside and adds to the area's driftwood problem. According to U.S. and International Law (MARPOL 73/78) it is illegal for ships to dump dunnage within of the shore. Currently, the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), an international regulatory agency, mandates its 134 signatory countries to comply with the ISPM 15, which requires all dunnage to be heat-treated or fumigated with pesticides and marked with an accredited seal. There are several instances in which foreign insects have entered by land and caused devastation to the ecosystem, even ruining crops.\n\nIn construction, dunnage is often scrap wood or disposable manufactured material whose purpose is to be placed on the ground to raise construction materials to allow access for forklifts and slings for hoisting, and to protect them from the elements.\n\nDunnage can also refer to a structural platform for mechanical equipment. Typically, these are open steel structures located on the roof of a building, consisting of steel beams supported on posts or bearing walls. They are used to raise equipment off the roof for various reasons, including maintenance access to both the roof surface and equipment itself, or to provide clearance to keep equipment out of any snow or rain that may collect on the roof. In this use, the dunnage is typically a permanent part of the building structure for the life of the equipment being supported.\n\nDunnage bags are air-filled pouches that can be used to stabilize, secure and protect cargo during transportation. Dunnage bags are placed in the voids between the cargo items. Dunnage bags can be used in all modes of transportation; road, railway, ocean or air.\n\nOriginally rubber bags were used to brace pallets inside trucks. They evolved into kraft paper bags with a plastic-bag interior. As metal strapping became less popular, many companies now use polyethylene- or vinyl-based bags because of their low cost. It is important to match the size of the bag to the void.\n\nStarting in the 1950s, several US railroad freight carriers began rostering boxcars equipped with load-securing devices to prevent shifting during transit. These cars were usually labeled \"Damage Free\" or simply \"DF\". The interior equipment helped to eliminate the need for customer-supplied dunnage.\n\nIn the 21st century, Amazon began air-filling dunnage bags on site during packing in order to minimize environmental impact, shipping weight, and cost of packing materials.\n\nDunnage for securing cargo in holds of ships has evolved from wooden boards forming \"cribs\" to modern mechanical, spring-loaded post-and-socket systems, exemplified by the \"pogo sticks\" used on US Navy Combat Logistics Force (CLF) ships which provide underway replenishment of stores, spares, repair parts, ammunition, ordnance, and liquids in cans and drums. Dunnage segregates cargo in the hold and prevents shifting of the cargo in response to ship motions.\n\nDuring the shipbuilding process, dunnage is commonly used to describe items such as welding machines, hoses, ladders, and scaffolding which are not part of the ship and will not remain aboard after it is completed.\n\nOutfitters and mule packers use the term dunnage when they transport freight, such as camping gear and food supplies, but do not carry passengers. In fishing net products \"dunnage\" may refer to a reinforcement of the edges of the net. It has historically been widely used in the United Kingdom for a sailor's personal belongings, as in, \"Stow your dunnage and report to the First Mate\".\nMany manufacturing facilities use the term dunnage to refer to the containers and packaging used for their finished goods. This can be anything from wood boxes or steel bins to wire baskets and plastic trays. Commonly this packaging is designed specifically to hold the product being manufactured and is proprietary to that manufacturing facilities requirements. On some vessels, it is used as a euphemism for human waste.\n\n\n"}

These applications are computationally demanding and usually run on supercomputers. The ESMF is considered a technical layer, integrated into a sophisticated common modeling infrastructure for interoperability. Other aspects of interoperability and shared infrastructure include: common experimental protocols, common analytic methods, common documentation standards for data and data provenance, shared workflow, and shared model components.\n\nThe ESMF project is distinguished by its strong emphasis on community governance and distributed development, and by a diverse customer base that includes modeling groups from universities, major U.S. research centers, the National Weather Service, the Department of Defense, and NASA. The ESMF development team was centered at NCAR until 2009, after which it moved to the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory.\n\nEditing Earth System Modeling Framework is free software released under the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License.\n\nESMF increases the interoperability of Earth-science modeling software developed at different sites and promotes code reuse. The idea is to transform distributed, specialized knowledge and resources into a collaborative, integrated modeling community that operates more efficiently, can address a wider variety of problems more effectively, and is more responsive to societal needs.\n\nESMF is based on principles of component-based software engineering. The components within an ESMF software application usually represent large-scale physical domains such as the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, or land surface. Some models also represent specific processes (e.g. ocean biogeochemistry, the impact of solar radiation on the atmosphere) as components. In ESMF, components can create and drive other components so that an ocean biogeochemistry component can be part of a larger ocean component.\n\nThe software that connects physical domains is called a coupler in the Earth system modeling community. Couplers follow the mediator pattern and take the outputs from one component and transform them into the inputs that are needed to run another component. Transformations may include unit conversions, grid interpolation or remapping, mergers (i.e., combining land and ocean surfaces to form a completely covered global surface) or other specialized transformations. In ESMF, couplers are also software components.\n\nESMF represents user data in the form of data objects such as grids, fields, and arrays. The user data within a component may be copied or referenced into these ESMF objects. Once user data is part of an ESMF data object, framework methods can be used to transform and transfer the data as required to other components in the system. This generally happens within a coupler component.\n\nGrid interpolation and remapping are core utilities of ESMF. Interpolation weights can be generated in ESMF using bilinear interpolation, finite element patch recovery, and conservative remapping methods.\n\nESMF can associate metadata with data objects. The metadata, in the form of name and value pairs, is grouped into packages, which can be written out in XML and other standard formats. ESMF metadata packages are based on community conventions including the Climate and Forecast Metadata Conventions and the METAFOR Common Information Model.\n\nThe ESMF collaboration had its roots in the Common Modeling Infrastructure Working Group (CMIWG), an unfunded, grass-roots effort to explore ways of enhancing collaborative Earth system model development. The CMIWG attracted broad participation from major weather and climate modeling groups at research and operational centers. In a series of meetings held from 1998 to 2000, CMIWG members established general requirements and a preliminary design for a common software framework.\n\nIn September 2000, the NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) released a solicitation that called for the creation of an ESMF. A critical mass of CMIWG participants agreed to develop a coordinated response, based on their strawman framework design, and submitted three linked proposals. The first focused on development of the core ESMF software, the second on deployment of Earth science modeling applications, and the third on deployment of ESMF data assimilation applications. All three proposals were funded, at a collective level of $9.8 million over a three-year period. As the ESMF project gained momentum, it replaced the CMIWG as the focal point for developing community modeling infrastructure.\n\nDuring the period of NASA funding, the ESMF team developed a prototype of the framework and used it in a number of experiments that demonstrated coupling of modeling components from different institutions. ESMF was also used as the basis for the construction of a new model, the GEOS-5 atmospheric general circulation model at NASA Goddard.\n\nAs the end of the first funding cycle for ESMF neared, its collaborators wrote a project plan that described how ESMF could transition to an organization with multi-agency sponsorship for its next funding cycle. Major new five-year grants came from NASA, through the Modeling Analysis and Prediction (MAP) program for climate change and variability, and from the Department of Defense Battlespace Environments Institute. The National Science Foundation (NSF) continued funding part of the development team through NCAR core funds. Many smaller ESMF-based application adoption projects were funded in domains as diverse as space weather and sediment transport.\n\nAlso at the end of the first funding cycle, the ESMF collaborators wrote a white paper on future directions for the ESMF. This paper formed the basis for a proposal to NSF to combine ESMF (and other software frameworks) with data services to create a computational environment that supports an end-to-end modeling workflow.\n\nIn 2008, a project manager was appointed for the National Unified Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC), a joint project for weather prediction of the United States Navy, the National Weather Service, and the United States Air Force.\n\n\n\n"}

The emissions information in eGRID include carbon dioxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO), sulfur dioxide (SO), methane (CH), nitrous oxide (NO),and carbon dioxide equivalent (COe). CO, CH, and NO are greenhouse gases (GHG) that contribute to global warming or climate change. NO and SO contribute to unhealthy air quality and acid rain in many parts of the country. eGRID's resource mix information includes the following fossil fuel resources: coal, oil, gas, other fossil; nuclear resources; and the following renewable resources: hydroelectric (water), biomass (including biogas, landfill gas and digester gas), wind, solar, and geothermal.\n\neGRID data is presented as an Excel workbook with data worksheets and a table of contents. The eGRID workbook contains data at the boiler, generator, and plant levels and aggregated data by state, power control area, eGRID subregion, NERC region, and U.S. The workbook also includes a worksheet that displays the grid gross loss (%).\n\nAdditional documentation generally is also generally provided with each eGRID release. As an example, eGRID 2012 contains a Technical Support Document (PDF), Summary Tables (PDF), Subregion GHG output emission rates (PDF) for CO, CH, and NO (for GHG inventory and registry work), NERC region Map (JPG), eGRID2012 subregion map (JPG), and release notes (TXT). These files are available as separate downloadable files or all of them are contained in a ZIP file, \"all eGRID2012 files.\" Similar files can be downloaded for a given year's eGRID release from EPA’s eGRID website.\nThe primary data sources used for eGRID include data reported by electric generators to EPA’s Clean Air Markets Division (pursuant to 40 CFR Part 70) and to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).\n\neGRID data are used for carbon footprinting; emission reduction calculations; calculating indirect greenhouse gas emissions for The Climate Registry, the California Climate Action Registry, California’s Mandatory GHG emissions reporting program (Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, AB 32), and other GHG protocols; were used as the starting point for the new international carbon emissions database, CARMA. EPA tools and programs such as Power Profiler , Portfolio Manager, \nthe WasteWise Office Carbon Footprint Tool, the Green Power Equivalency Calculator, the Personal Greenhouse Gas Emissions Calculator, \nand the Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator use eGRID. Other tools such as labeling/environmental disclosure, Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) attributes are supported by eGRID data. States also rely on eGRID data for electricity labeling (environmental disclosure programs), emissions inventories, and for policy decisions such as output based standards. eGRID is additionally used by nongovernmental organizations for tools and analysis by the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM), the Rocky Mountain Institute, the National Resource Defense Council (NRDC), the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC), Powerscorecard.org, and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative.\n\nIn 2010, Executive Order 13514 was issued, requiring Federal agencies to “measure, report, and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from direct and indirect activities.” \nThe Federal GHG Accounting and Reporting Guidance accompanied this order and recommended using eGRID non-baseload emission rates to estimate the Scope 2 (indirect) emission reductions from renewable energy.\n\n\n"}

Ebbesmeyer studied the movements of a consignment of 29,000 Friendly Floatees—yellow ducks, red beavers, blue turtles and green frogs—which were washed into the Pacific Ocean in 1992. Some of the toys landed along Pacific Ocean shores, such as Hawaii. Others traveled over 17,000 miles, floating over the site where the \"Titanic\" sank, and spent years frozen in Arctic ice to reach the Eastern Seaboard, British and Irish shores 15 years later in 2007.\n\nA consignment of Friendly Floatee toys, manufactured in China for The First Years Inc., departed from Hong Kong on a container ship, the \"Ever Laurel\", destined for Tacoma, Washington. On 10 January 1992, during a storm in the North Pacific Ocean close to the International Date Line, twelve 40-foot (12-m) intermodal containers were washed overboard. One of these containers held 28,800 Floatees, a child's bath toy which came in a number of forms: red beavers, green frogs, blue turtles and yellow ducks. At some point, the container opened (possibly because it collided with other containers or the ship itself) and the Floatees were released. Although each toy was mounted in a plastic housing attached to a backing card, subsequent tests showed that the cardboard quickly degraded in sea water allowing the Floatees to escape. Unlike many bath toys, Friendly Floatees have no holes in them so they do not take on water.\n\nSeattle oceanographers Curtis Ebbesmeyer and James Ingraham, who were working on an ocean surface current model, began to track their progress. The mass release of 28,800 objects into the ocean at one time offered significant advantages over the standard method of releasing 500–1000 drift bottles. The recovery rate of objects from the Pacific Ocean is typically around 2%, so rather than the 10 to 20 recoveries typically seen with a drift bottle release, the two scientists expected numbers closer to 600. They were already tracking various other spills of flotsam, including 61,000 Nike running shoes that had been lost overboard in 1990.\n\nTen months after the incident, the first Floatees began to wash up along the Alaskan coast. The first discovery consisted of ten toys found by a beachcomber near Sitka, Alaska on 16 November 1992, about 2,000 miles (3,200 km) from their starting point. Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham contacted beachcombers, coastal workers, and local residents to locate hundreds of the beached Floatees over a 530 mile (850 km) shoreline. Another beachcomber discovered twenty of the toys on 28 November 1992, and in total 400 were found along the eastern coast of the Gulf of Alaska in the period up to August 1993. This represented a 1.4% recovery rate. The landfalls were logged in Ingraham's computer model OSCUR (Ocean Surface Currents Simulation), which uses measurements of air pressure from 1967 onwards to calculate the direction of and speed of wind across the oceans, and the consequent surface currents. Ingraham's model was built to help fisheries but it is also used to predict flotsam movements or the likely locations of those lost at sea.\n\nUsing the models they had developed, the oceanographers correctly predicted further landfalls of the toys in Washington state in 1996 and theorized that many of the remaining Floatees would have travelled to Alaska, westward to Japan, back to Alaska, and then drifted northwards through the Bering Strait and become trapped in the Arctic pack ice. Moving slowly with the ice across the Pole, they predicted it would take five or six years for the toys to reach the North Atlantic where the ice would thaw and release them. Between July and December 2003, The First Years Inc. offered a $100 US savings bond reward to anybody who recovered a Floatee in New England, Canada or Iceland. More of the toys were recovered in 2004 than in any of the preceding three years. However, still more of these toys were predicted to have headed eastward past Greenland and make landfall on the southwestern shores of the United Kingdom in 2007. In July 2007, a retired teacher found a plastic duck on the Devon coast, and British newspapers mistakenly announced that the Floatees had begun to arrive. But the day after breaking the story, the Western Morning News, the local Devon newspaper, reported that Dr. Simon Boxall of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton had examined the specimen and determined that the duck was not in fact a Floatee.\n\nBleached by sun and seawater, the ducks and beavers had faded to white, but the turtles and frogs had kept their original colors.\n\nAt least two children's books have been inspired by the Floatees. In 1997, Clarion Books published \"Ducky\" (), written by Eve Bunting and illustrated by Caldecott Medal winner David Wisniewski. Hans Christian Andersen Award winner Eric Carle wrote \"10 Little Rubber Ducks\" (Harper Collins 2005, ).\n\nIn 2011, Donovan Hohn published \"Moby-Duck: The True Story of 28,800 Bath Toys Lost at Sea and of the Beachcombers, Oceanographers, Environmentalists, and Fools, Including the Author, Who Went in Search of Them\" (Viking, )\n\nOn 20 June 2014, The Disney Channel and Disney Junior aired \"Lucky Duck\", a Canadian-American animated tv movie that is loosely based on and inspired by the Friendly Floatees.\n\nThe toys themselves have become collector's items, fetching prices as high as $1,000.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25368336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25368336", "title": "Indian God Rock", "text": "Indian God Rock\n\nIndian God Rock is a large boulder in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Located near the unincorporated community of Brandon, it lies along the Allegheny River in Venango County's Rockland Township. It is significant for the large petroglyph on one of its sides. Because of the petroglyph, the rock has been an explorers' landmark, a tourist attraction, and an object of scholarly investigation.\n\nOne of many large boulders lining the banks of the Allegheny River in Venango County, Indian God Rock is composed of sandstone and measures approximately 22×14×10 feet, or 7×4×4 meters by another measurement. As sandstone is an easy material to carve, the rock was an ideal surface for the creation of rock art.\n\nAmong the fifty-five different figures present on Indian God Rock include geometric shapes and depictions of humans and animals in a range of positions. Two of the carvings appear to be images of archers; these two figures are the only known representations of archers in the Native American rock art of the Ohio River valley. One scholar has held that the resemblance between certain figures on the rock and drawings on extant birch bark scrolls indicates that the rock was used by tribal shamans, and he proposes that the rarity of martial themes among the carvings indicates that the carvers were members of a peaceful culture. Indian God Rock is not the only petroglyph site in Rockland Township; another, known as the \"Rainbow Rocks Petroglyphs Site,\" is located at a significantly higher altitude near the community of Van, approximately to the east.\n\nThe date of the petroglyph is uncertain; it is believed to have been carved at some point after AD 900, but most likely after 1200. The terminus ante quem for its creation is 1749, when it was recorded by multiple members of a French expedition along the Allegheny. At this time, the rock was plainly invested with religious meaning; according to one member of the expedition, accompanying Native American guides \"regarded the rock with superstitious reverence.\" Besides recording the rock and their disdain for the \"savages\" who created it, the expedition placed two lead plates at the site as evidence of their presence. During the nineteenth century, Indian God Rock became a popular tourist attraction — steamships on the Allegheny would often stop to allow their passengers to examine the petroglyph.\n\nIn recent decades, the Indian God Rock has suffered significantly from erosion and vandalism. Since the nineteenth century, visitors have cut their names into the rock, and recent years have seen the use of spray paint by some individuals. Although archaeologists have highlighted the carvings in the past, the figures are now somewhat difficult to see.\n\nIn the twentieth century, Indian God Rock became the object of significant archaeological investigation for the information potential of its carvings. Its place as the first Ohio River valley petroglyph to appear in written records and the continued scholarly attention to its carvings has caused it to be seen as the premier example of monumental rock art in its region. The United States Forest Service has recognized the rock as one of the most significant of the seventy-five Native American archaeological sites in the portion of the Allegheny River that has been designated a National Wild and Scenic River. In 1984, it was further recognized when the National Park Service added it to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 1982, the rock lay on the right-of-way for a railroad line operated by the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. Today, the rail line is closed; instead, the Middle Allegheny River Water Trail passes near the rock, and hikers can view the rock from a lookout along the trail. As in the nineteenth century, Indian God Rock is also visible from watercraft on the Allegheny River.\n\n\n"}

It spans the time between 251.902 Ma and Ma (million years ago). It is preceded by the Changhsingian and is followed by the Olenekian.\n\nThe Induan is roughly coeval with the regional Feixianguanian stage of China.\n\nThe Induan stage was introduced into scientific literature by Russian stratigraphers in 1956, who divided the Scythian stage that was used by Western stratigraphers into the Induan and Olenekian stages. The Induan stage is named for the Indus region of Pakistan/India. The Russian subdivision of the Lower Triassic then slowly replaced the one used in the West.\n\nThe base of the Induan stage (which is also the base of the Lower Triassic series, the base of the Triassic system and the base of the Mesozoic erathem) is defined as the place in the fossil record where the conodont species \"Hindeodus parvus\" first appears, or at the end of the negative δO anomaly after the big extinction event at the Permian-Triassic boundary. The global reference profile of the base of the Induan is situated in Changxing County, China.\n\nThe top of the Induan stage (the base of the Olenekian) is at the first appearance of ammonite species \"Meekoceras gracilitatis\".\n\nThough the Induan is an unusually short age at this point in the geologic timescale, its million years' extent still contains five ammonite biozones in the boreal domain and four ammonite biozones in the Tethyan domain.\n\nThe Induan age followed the mass extinction event at the end of the Permian period. Both global biodiversity and community-level (alpha) diversity remained low through much of this stage of the Triassic. Much of the world remained almost lifeless, deserted, hot, and dry. The lystrosaurids (below) and the proterosuchids (below) were the only groups of land animals to dominate during the Induan stage. Other animals, such as the ammonites, fishes, insects, and the tetrapods (cynodonts, amphibians, reptiles, etc.) remained rare and terrestrial ecosystems did not recover for some 30 million years. Both the seas and much of the freshwater during the Induan were anoxic.\n\n\n\n"}

A bora ground was also located between the Koonadan dune and Tuckerbil Swamp, but evidence of it has been erased by changes in land use. In the late 19th century, many Wiradjuri were removed from the Koonadan area to Warangesda and Euabalong, not returning to until the gradual closing of Aboriginal missions and reserves between the mid-1920's to 1950's, when many settled in Leeton and Narrandera. \n\nAfter the 1950's, the site was cleared of trees, and Tuckerbil Swamp was drained, which has greatly diminished the areas food resources. \n\nIn the early 1980's, sand mining of the Koonadan dune unearthed skeletal remains associated with two different skeletons, which were then reburied by the local Aboriginal community.

Their sizes range from dwarf planets and moons to the planets and the Sun. This list does not include any small Solar System bodies, but it does include a sample of planetary-mass objects whose shape has yet to be accurately determined. The Sun's orbital characteristics are listed in relation to the Galactic Center, while all other objects are listed in order of their distance from the Sun.\n\nThe Sun is a G-type main-sequence star. It contains almost 99.9 percent of all the mass in the Solar System.\n\nA planet is defined according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union (IAU) definition as a body in orbit around the Sun that was large enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and to have cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. The practical meaning of \"cleared the neighborhood\" is that a planet is comparatively massive enough for its gravitation to control the orbits of all objects in its vicinity. By the IAU's definition, there are eight planets in the Solar System; four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) and four giant planets, which can be divided further into two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). When excluding the Sun, the four giant planets account for more than 99 percent of the mass of the Solar System.\n\nThe IAU, the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies, defines dwarf planets as bodies that are large enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, but have not cleared their neighbourhoods of similar objects. Since 2008, there have been five dwarf planets recognized by the IAU. Ceres orbits in the asteroid belt, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The others orbit beyond Neptune and are subclassified as plutoids.\n\nThese trans-Neptunian objects are theoretically large enough to be dwarf planets. Dozens more could have been included. Both Quaoar and Orcus have known moons that have allowed the mass of the systems to be determined.

It purports to reveal how the economy trumps other concerns, which allows for the elevation of class as the focus of the study.\n\nIn the 19th century, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote that the main source of instability in the international system would be capitalist globalization, more specifically the conflict between two classes: the national bourgeoisie and the cosmopolitan proletariat. Historical materialism was going to be Marxism’s guideline in understanding the processes both in domestic and international affairs. Thus, for Marx human history has been a struggle to satisfy material needs and to resists class domination and exploitation. Despite ideological criticism, Marxism has strong empirical advantages on its side. Firstly, by emphasizing injustice and inequality it is very relevant to every period of time as these two failures of the human society have never been absent. Marxism is a structural theory just like neorealism, but it focuses on the economic sector instead of the military-political one. Its analysis reflects the relation between the base (the modes of production) and the superstructure (political institutions). The source of structural effects is not anarchy, but the capitalist mode of production which defines unjust political institutions and state relations.\n\nThis economic reductionism is considered also to be a central flaw. As a solution, the neo-Gramscian school proposed a further development. By combining global capitalism, state structure and political-economic institutions, they managed to create a theory of global hegemony (ideological domination). According to this theory, hegemony is maintained through close cooperation between powerful elites inside and outside the core regions of the world system. Global governance is constituted by political and economic institutions that put pressure on the less developed and unstable peripheral countries.\n\nFrom an epistemological point of view, Marxism created the foundations for critical theory and it is superior in this sense to the dominant approaches of Anglo-American international relations that are problem-solving theories. As any other critical theory, Marxism has a normative interest in identifying possibilities for social transformation and how theory is instrumental to power. This is why Marx wrote about capitalism with an interest in the social forces that would bring about its downfall hoping that humanity would be free from domination and exploitation. Realists in particular see this to be politically motivated and not objective and neutral. The normative disadvantage of Marxism is that it can be seen as Eurocentric by promoting the Enlightenment ideal of cosmopolitanism.\n\nLinked in with Marxist theories is dependency theory which argues that developed countries in their pursuit of power penetrate developing states through political advisors, missionaries, experts and multi-national corporations (MNCs) to integrate them into the capitalist system in order to appropriate natural resources and foster dependence by developing countries on developed countries.\n\nRealists and liberals criticize Marxist conflict theories for ideological and consequentialist reasons. Postpositivists disagree with Marxists' elevation of class conflict as the most significant aspect of human life and the key to understanding all human history and behavior.\n\n"}

The change in rotational period of the neutron star comes from the transition region between the magnetosphere and the plasma flow from the companion star. In this context the magnetosphere is defined as the region of space surrounding the neutron star, in which the magnetic field determines the motion of the plasma. Inside the magnetic field, the plasma will eventually co-rotate with the neutron star while in the transition region, angular momentum from the accretion disk will be transferred via the magnetic field to the neutron star, leading to the spin-up.\n\nStellar spin-down\n"}

Very early on, Olivier de Kersauson was to break away from his family. Without being inattentive, he was a pupil who did not settle in well to school life with the priests at boarding school. He passed through eleven schools altogether. After his final school exams and getting up to a lot of things, always on the coast, he began studying economics.\n\nAt the age of twenty-two, he met Eric Tabarly in Saint Malo. Shortly after, Eric invited him to do his military service on board.

{"id": "26278007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26278007", "title": "Phoenix of Hiroshima", "text": "Phoenix of Hiroshima\n\nThe Phoenix of Hiroshima was a 50-foot, 30-ton yacht that circumnavigated the globe and was later involved in several famous protest voyages. Between its launch in 1954 and its sinking in 2010, the \"Phoenix\" carried a family around the world, was used to make protest voyages against nuclear weapons, was declared a Japanese national shrine, and ended up offered free on Craigslist, gutted and stripped of masts, phoenix figurehead and every identifying mark but the words \"Phoenix of Hiroshima.\"\n\nNamed for the mythological bird which rises from the ashes of its own destruction, the \"Phoenix\" was built near Hiroshima and launched May 5, 1954. It was designed by Dr. Earle L. Reynolds (1910–1998), an anthropologist who had been sent to Hiroshima by the National Academy of Sciences to research the effects of the first atomic bomb on the physical growth and development of surviving Japanese children (1951–1954). In Oriental mythology the Phoenix is a bird which appears only in time of universal peace.\n\nDr. Reynolds patterned the , double-ended ketch on the Colin Archer design used for sturdy Norwegian fishing vessels. The boat rose symbolically from the ashes of the city destroyed by the first atomic bomb but it also rose, over the period of a year and a half, from the small unprepossessing shipyard of Mr. Yotsuda in Miyajimaguchi, across the Inland Sea of Japan from the famous Miyajima Shrine. Until approached by Reynolds, Yotsuda had only built sampans and was struggling to recover financially from the second World War.\n\nThe boat was originally constructed entirely of native Japanese woods. (In 1956, the mainmast became infested with borer-type insects and was replaced in Auckland with one of native New Zealand kauri pine.) It was double-planked, mahogany over hinoki (cypress). The hull was hinoki above the water line, sugi (cryptomeria cedar) below. The cabins below decks consisted of mahogany, camphor, cherry, chestnut and Japanese cabinet woods.\n\nWhen Dr. Reynolds finished the first three years of what was intended to be a longitudinal study interrupted by a one-year sabbatical, he and his family (wife Barbara Leonard Reynolds, second son Ted,16, daughter Jessica, 10, and three Hiroshima yachtsmen) sailed the \"Phoenix\" around the world. Ted navigated the 30-ton vessel, using calculations from sun shots made with a hand-held sextant. The trip extended past the one year allotted and for a number of reasons, Reynolds did not resume his job in Hiroshima.\n\nThe first leg of the circumnavigation, from Japan to Hawaii, took 48 days, most of which were rough and stormy. It was followed by ideal sailing weather to and through the South Seas: Tahiti, Moorea, Raiatea, Tahaa and Bora Bora in the Society Islands; Rarotonga, American Samoa, Fiji. From there they sailed to New Zealand (Auckland and Wellington); Australia (Sydney, the Great Barrier Reef, Cairns); Indonesia (Bali, Java).\n\nThey weathered a typhoon off the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, touched in at Rodrigues and Mauritius and changed course to round the tip of South Africa (Durban, Cape Town) rather than go through the Mediterranean during the Suez crisis; Brazil (Fortaleza); the east coast of the United States from New York, then south to the West Indies. They went through the Panama Canal to the Galapagos Islands, where they traded six packages of instant powdered milk, one can of shortening and two bottles of hot pepper sauce for a Galapagos tortoise, 11x11 inches across the shell, naming him Jonathan Mushmouth. (They had a legal permit issued in Ecuador, to take \"two of every kind\" of animal from the islands.) Years later they gave Jonathan to the Hanshin Zoo in Osaka, Japan, the zoo's first Galapagos tortoise. The Reynolds family expected Jonathan to outlive them but he died in the 1980s.\n\nIn the Galapagos the \"Phoenix\" just missed being hijacked by escaped convicts. \"The Historical Chronology of the Galapagos, 1535–2000\" records in February 1958 that \"The \"Phoenix\", with Earle Reynolds, his wife Barbara, their children, Jessica and Ted and a Japanese crewmember arrived at Wreck Bay.\" They went on to Academy Bay where they found the French yacht \"Cle Du Sol\", and just missed a previously arranged meeting with the American yacht \"Valinda\". Convicts living in the penal colony on Isabela Island were asked to prepare a celebration on February 12 but on the 9th they revolted with stolen weapons and took the guards prisoners. The convicts boarded two fishing boats, the \"Teresita\" and the \"Ecuador\". At Punta Moreno they took possession of the \"Viking\". They then went to Santiago Island where they captured the \"Valinda\" belonging to William Rhodes Hervey Jr. They reached the continent on the 17th and abandoned ship at Esmeraldas but were eventually captured by the police.\n\nThe \"Phoenix\" and \"Valinda\" had scheduled a rendezvous in James Bay on San Salvador Island on February 16. The \"Phoenix\" was there and waited all day but the \"Valinda\" never showed up. Months later, Earle read in a back issue of Life Magazine that the \"Valinda\" had arrived in James Bay the night before (\"while we were all asleep aboard the \"Phoenix\", five miles away around the point\") but was then hijacked by the 21 escapees from the penal colony who forced the crew to sail to Ecuador.\n\nUnaware of their close call, the Reynoldses proceeded on to the Marquesas and back to Hawaii. Two of the three Japanese men flew back to Japan from Panama. First mate Niichi (Nick) Mikami remained with the \"Phoenix\". After 645 days, 1222 ports and , the \"Phoenix\" once again sailed into Honolulu harbor.\n\nTechnically this completed a circumnavigation of the globe but the trip had started in Japan and the Reynolds family intended to culminate it there. A change in plans delayed their return for two years. Their route back to Japan was blocked by the Enewetak Proving Ground, a area of the Pacific declared off-limits to Americans by the U.S. government, which was using the area to test nuclear weapons during Operation Hardtack I. A smaller yacht, the Golden Rule, was docked near the \"Phoenix\" at the time. Its crew of Quaker pacifists, Albert Bigelow, George Willoughby, William R. Huntington, James Peck and Orion Sherwood had attempted to sail into this forbidden zone to protest nuclear testing and had been brought back by the U.S. Coast Guard. The example set by the Golden Rule and her crew was also the inspiration for all the modern environmental and peace voyages, and craft that followed in her wake.\n\nImpressed by the reasoning and character of these men, Earle and Barbara joined the Society of Friends (Quakers) and considered taking over their protest in the \"Phoenix\". Dr. Reynolds, an expert on the dangers of radiation, was concerned about the effect of this additional radiation on the world environment. Mikami, as a citizen of Hiroshima, said in effect that his desire to be included on such a trip was a \"no brainer.\" The family spent days in research, thought and prayer and on June 11, 1958, the \"Phoenix\" cleared from Honolulu \"for the high seas.\" On July 1, at the edge of the invisible perimeter of the zone, Reynolds announced by radiotelephone, on the international frequency for ships at sea, \"The United States yacht \"Phoenix\" is sailing today into the nuclear test zone as a protest against nuclear testing...\" The \"Phoenix\" became the first vessel to enter a nuclear test zone in protest when they sailed into the test area at Bikini Atoll. (Years later, in private correspondence, Captain Bigelow wrote Earle that most people had never heard of the \"Phoenix\" and thought the Golden Rule had sailed into the area.) They were intercepted inside the forbidden area by an American Coast Guard vessel, the \"Planetree,\" whose armed officers boarded the yacht and put Dr. Reynolds under arrest. They ordered him to sail the \"Phoenix\" to Kwajalein, escorted by the Navy destroyer \"Collett\" and from there they flew him, with Barbara and Jessica, back to Honolulu for trial.\n\nBarbara returned to Kwajalein to help Ted (then age 20) and Mikami sail the \"Phoenix\" back to Honolulu, a trip of 60 days (August 15 – October 14) against the wind, while Earle was being tried and convicted for entering the off-limits zone. When Earle's conviction was overturned on appeal, the family sailed back to Hiroshima and Nick Mikami became the first Japanese yachtsman to sail around the world. The \"Phoenix\" was declared a Japanese national shrine, and city buses were re-routed past its dock so bus conductors could point it out to passengers.\n\nIn October 1961 the Reynolds family, now living back in Japan, sailed the \"Phoenix\" on a second protest voyage, this time to Nakhodka, USSR, to protest the resumption of Soviet nuclear resting. As the Japanese government would not give Mikami a passport to travel to the Soviet Union, American citizen Tom Yoneda sailed with them. They were stopped within the 12-mile (19 km) limit claimed by the USSR by a Soviet Coast Guard boat. The captain and several other officers jumped aboard the \"Phoenix\". Although the Reynoldses were able to have a two-hour discussion about peace with him, Captain Ivanov would not accept the hundreds of letters from Hiroshima and Nagasaki citizens, begging for peace.\n\nAfter Earle and Barbara divorced in 1964, Earle and his new wife Akie Nagami, a citizen of Hiroshima, sailed the \"Phoenix\" in 1967 through the American battle fleet to North Vietnam to deliver medical supplies to civilians injured by American bombing. A fund raising concert/dance event was organized and held at the Fillmore Auditorium. The bands that played were Country Joe and the Fish, Big Brother and the Holding Company (with Janis Joplin), Steve Miller Blues Band, and Quicksilver Messenger Service. A multi-national crew delivered nearly a ton of medical aid to the Red Cross Society of North Vietnam for victims of the war. They spent eight days visiting hospitals in Hanoi and Haiphong and observing the effects of American bombing on outlying villages. This journey was recorded in the documentary film \"Voyage of the Phoenix\" filmed by William Heick for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nThey also attempted two goodwill missions to China \"from a Japanese and an American\" (at that time neither country recognized Red China) but were physically prevented from doing so, the first time (1967) by the Japanese government and the second (1968) by the Chinese Coast Guard.\n\nFor these attempts, the Japanese government expelled Reynolds in 1970 from the country in which he had lived for 13 years. He and Akie sailed the \"Phoenix\" to San Francisco and settled at Quaker Center in Ben Lomond, California, near Santa Cruz with the boat moored at nearby Moss Landing. During that time, after offering the \"Phoenix\" to each of his three grown children and after being turned down, Earle sold the \"Phoenix\" to another American family intending to sail around the world and gave the $20,000 from the sale to the Quaker Center in exchange for lifetime residency there.\n\nIn March 2007, mention of the \"Phoenix\", gutted and minus both masts and its hand-carved Phoenix figurehead, showed up in an ad on Craigslist which began, \"FREE: 50-foot yacht. . .\" John Gardner of Lodi, California, then 31, took possession of the \"Phoenix\" and had it towed up the Sacramento River, hoping to restore it and use it to rehabilitate young people recovering from substance abuse. During the journey, the yacht collided with a dock and had to be kept afloat with the help of a battery-powered bilge pump. In August 2010 the \"Phoenix\" went down off Tyler Island despite Gardner's efforts to keep it from sinking. In September 2010 Dr. Naomi Reynolds, granddaughter of the original Dr. Reynolds, took possession of the yacht, resting in 25 feet of water in the Mokelumne River. A diver inspected the vessel and found no serious damage. Peace activists are currently restoring the \"Golden Rule\" (2013) and plan to resume peace activities in it. They hope to raise funds to raise and restore \"Phoenix of Hiroshima\" next.\n\n\n"}

It was a product of the disciplines of plant physiology and botany.\n\nPhytotrons unified and extended earlier piecemeal efforts to claim total control of the whole environment. In both walk-in rooms and smaller reach-in cabinets, phytotrons produced and reproduced whole complex climates of many variables. In the first phytotrons each individual room was held at a constant unique temperature. The Australian phytotron, for example, had rooms maintaining 9°C, 12°C, 16°C, 20°C, 23°C, 26°C, 30°C, 34°C. Because some of the earliest controlled environment experiments showed that plants reacted differently in daytime temperatures and nighttime temperatures, the first experiments to observe the effect(s) of varying the daytime versus the nighttime temperature saw experimenters move their plants from higher to lower temperatures over the course of a daily, or any other variable or constant, routine. This rendered the variable “temperature” experimentally controllable. Even a brute force approach that tested each successive environmental variable and every variety of plant would serve to pinpoint specific environmental conditions to maximize growth. Expecting that more knowledge would surely come from greater technology, the next generation of phytotrons expanded in technological reach, in their ranges of environmental variables, and also in the degree of control over each variable. The phytotron in Stockholm offered a humidity controlled room and a custom built computer, as well as a low temperature room that extended the temperature range down to -25°C for the study of Nordic forests. After that, phytotron technology compressed whole environments into smaller cabinets able to be set to any desired combination of environmental conditions, which are still in use today. \n\nThe first phytotron was built under the direction of Frits Warmolt Went at the California Institute of Technology in 1949. It was funded by the Harry B. Earhart Foundation, and was officially known as the Earhart Plant Research Laboratory. It acquired its more distinctive nickname evidently from a joking conversation between Caltech biologists James Bonner and Sam Wildman. Recalling the origin sometime in 1980s Bonner noted that:\n\"The Earhart Plant Research Laboratory [was] called an environmentally controlled greenhouse but my first postdoctoral fellow [Sam Wildman] and I, sitting around about 1950, having coffee, decided it deserved a better or more euphonious name [...]. We decided to call it a phytotron—phytos from the Greek word for plant, and tron as in cyclotron, a big complicated machine. Went was originally enormously annoyed by this word. But Dr. Millikan took it right up saying, ‘this edifice financed by Mr. Earhart, is going to do for plant biology what the cyclotron has done for physics,’ and he christened it a phytotron.\"\n\nPhytotrons spread around the world between 1945 and the present day to Australia, France, Hungary, the Soviet Union, England, and the United States. Moreover, they have spurred variants such as the Climatron at the Missouri Botanical Garden, the Biotron at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Ecotron at Imperial College London and the Brisatron at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory.\n\nDavid P.D.

He returned home disabled and was unable to resume his work at the mine, consequently purchasing a block of virgin bush at Kendenup to begin farming as an orchardist. It was here that Rica met botanical artist Emily Pelloe in 1921. Pelloe was introduced after Jack De Garis, the publisher of Pelloe's books, gave the Sandilands family a gift of her just published \"Wildflowers of Western Australia\" as a Christmas present.\n\nShe returned to the goldfields to attend Eastern Goldfields High School, staying with her grandmother for five years. While living in Boulder she joined Girl Guides Australia where she developed an interest in birds and flowering plants. Choosing a career of teaching she was appointed as monitor teacher at her family town of Kendenup in 1924. After Kendenup, she was transferred to Mount Barker, Dumbleyung and Gnowangerup and in 1927 went to Perth and entered Claremont Teachers College for the required one year of training to become a country teacher. While there she met Dom Serventy and joined the Western Australian Naturalists' Club.\n\nBy 1931 she was teaching at isolated one-teacher schools such as Aurora between Cranbrook and Kojonup, and later at Young's Siding near Wilson Inlet, and Denmark. The countryside on the southern coast piqued an interest in orchids and coincided with the publication of her friend Emily Pelloe's second book, \"West Australian Orchids\". Eminent orchidologists Edith Coleman and Dr. Richard Sanders Rogers were quoted extensively in Pelloe's book, and Erickson established contact, sending them sketches and pressings of orchids found in her region. Wilson Inlet was the site of many specimens painted in 1881 by Robert D. FitzGerald, who published the important work \"Australian Orchids\". In Christmas 1931 she holidayed in Victoria and met Coleman and Rogers who encouraged her further study. Knowing she would be returning to a school posting near Wilson Inlet, Rogers instructed her on the finer details of painting the plants using pen and ink instead of pencil as she did previously.\n\nAfter several years teaching on the southern coast of Western Australia, Erickson requested and received a transfer to the school at Bolgart north of Toodyay in 1934. It was here that she regularly passed by \"Hawthornden\", the historic house of pioneer settler, botanist and naturalist James Drummond. Later she would write a detailed family history of the Drummond family, in \"The Drummonds of Hawthornden\", as well as histories of the surrounding districts in \"The Victoria Plains\" and \"Old Toodyay and Newcastle\". Another interest that she followed in Bolgart was bees and wasps, which she studied with the apiologist Tarlton Rayment.\n\nIn Bolgart she met share-farmer and future husband Sydney \"Syd\" Uden Erickson (1908–1987) and they were married in Fremantle in June 1936. The couple bought land at Bolgart in 1938, which they cleared and named \"Fairlea\". They raised four children: Dorothy (born 1939), John (1940), Bethel (1942), and Robin (1943); the next few years were devoted largely to raising the children and establishing the farm. However Erickson maintained her interest in natural history and in 1951 published her first book, the self-illustrated \"Orchids of the West\". This was followed by \"Triggerplants\" in 1958.\n\nThe state botanist Charles Gardner ran a wildflower tour in 1957 for the Midland Railway Road Service. The following year Erickson was invited to lead the tour, taking the opportunity for a paid holiday. In later years she led other groups of tourists on nature based tours in the south and north of the state.\n\nIn 1965 the couple travelled to Europe for a holiday where Rica spent some time studying Drummond's plant specimens at the Kew Gardens herbarium in London, which were sent from Western Australia in the mid-19th century. On their return, they retired from farm life and settled in the Perth suburb of Nedlands, where Erickson wrote several more books. She became a member of the Royal Western Australian Historical Society and her writing during this period focussed on the early days of the state's European settlement, and its convict era. She wrote a history of the society called \"Forty Years of the Royal Western Australian Historical Society: 1936–1976\" which was published in \"Early Days\". Assisted by a group of volunteers, she compiled the first three volumes of the \"Dictionary of West Australians\" in time for Western Australia's sesquicentennial year of 1979.\n\nIn 1973 \"Flowers and Plants of Western Australia\" was first published. This book on Western Australian wildflowers and designed for popular use contained over 500 colour photographs and was the combined effort of Erickson as chairman and coordinator, Alex George and Neville Marchant as botanists, and Michael Morcombe as the photographer.\n\nSyd died in 1987. Rica died on 8 September 2009 at Mosman Park.\n\nIn 1964, the Bolgart Branch of the Country Women's Association petitioned the Victoria Plains Shire Council for the protection of of remaining forest along the Old Plains Road, about south-west of Calingiri, an important track through the bush which was blazed by Drummond in 1842. The reserve is located at .\n\nThe request was granted, and in 1996, following another request from the Association, the Department of Conservation and Land Management named Reserve 27595 the Rica Erickson Nature Reserve. Naming the reserve after a living person was an unusual step for the Department's naming committee. Over three hundred people attended the official opening on 11 August 1996.\n\nGoogle Street View of nature reserve entrance. \n\nIn 1980 she was awarded an honorary degree of doctor of letters from the University of Western Australia for her research and work in the field of botany. In the same year she was named Western Australian Citizen of the Year in the category of the Arts, Culture and Entertainment, and in 1987 was made a Member of the Order of Australia, \"in recognition of service to the arts, particularly as an author and illustrator\". Her botanical illustrations have been exhibited at the Art Gallery of Western Australia and Perth's Alexander Library.\n\nIn May 2007 she was awarded the Heritage Council of Western Australia individual award for her lifelong contribution to heritage in Western Australia.\n\nNoted botanist Alex George with whom she co-wrote \"Flowers and Plants of Western Australia\" in 1973, wrote: \"Rica Erickson has been one of the foremost amateur natural historians in Western Australia in the 20th Century.\"\n\nRonda Jamieson, Director of the J S Battye Library in Western Australia said \"Rica Erickson is one of Western Australia's treasures\". The State Library houses the Rica Erickson collection, a repository which includes manuscripts of her publications, background papers relating to the genealogical dictionaries, all of her published works, field journals, and 500 of her botanical art works. A website maintained by the library has been created as a tribute to her.\n\nIn 2004, Stephen Hopper and Andrew P. Brown named an orchid genus \"Ericksonella\" in her honour.\n\nA bibliography of works is at SLWA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a bay between Yeosu and Goheung peninsulas, located from the center of Suncheon, with of mudflats and of reed beds.\n\nFrom the junction of the Dong and Isa streams to the beginning of the mudflat in Suncheon Bay, it has the widest reed bed in Korea. In autumn, reed blossoms, red turkeys, and white migratory birds make the area a popular attraction.\n\nSuncheon Bay, facing the South Sea, has a climate strongly influenced by the sea. The average temperature of the coldest month is about . A yearly average temperature is . The annual temperature range is smaller than other areas.\n\nGardening and cultivation advances benefit from the warm temperatures in winter. The area is developing fisheries for gray mullet, gizzard shad and octopus, and an aquaculture industry.\n\nThe administrative area of Suncheon Bay is over . The total area of sandbar exposed at the ebb tide is about and the total is .\n\nSuncheon Bay is about 8,000 years old. Studies performed by geologists have determined that, after the earth's last glacial epoch, the level of sea increased about . The western area of Korea, called West Sea, turned from land to sea. The Korean peninsula was as it is today. Suncheon Bay consists of brackish water, earth and sand, transported in by the river and accumulated over time by the tide of the sea, forming an extensive sandbar.\n\nSuncheon Bay is a treasure house of many diverse species, making it an important area of study. Due to little pollution, the area has developed salty swampy land, abounding in fresh marine products, and numerous and varied invertebrate animals and sea plants.\n\nThe extensive reedbeds form the wintering site and habitat for rare birds including the hooded crane, sea gull, white stork, black-faced spoonbill and eastern great egret.\n\nThe land frequently called a swamp is the transition region between land and sea. It is also called \"the swirl of life\" and \"the lungs of earth,\" due to the many lifeforms that live in it.\n\nThe swampy area of Suncheon Bay expands into the downstream area at which Dong-cheon and Isa-cheon meet, supplying the swampy land. The speed of the current rises by the increasing slope, and the land extends downstream. The swampy land, unique to Korea, is preserved in view of its natural ecology.\n\nThe reedbeds and \"Suaeda japonica\" of Suncheon Bay are the main habitat for migratory birds, which attracts tourists.\n\nThe sandbar is unceasingly provided with nutrients from the river and is home to a diverse variety of animals and plants. The productive ecosystem of a sandbar is a habitat on which 20% of creatures on earth live. Suncheon Bay is about 8 million pyeong in size. The depth of the highly developed fine clay layers is about . The sandbar is very productive and fills the role of natural purification and esthetics.\n\nA total of 116 species, 92 genera, and 36 families of plants inhabit the salty area of Suncheon Bay. A community of \"Phragmites communis\" forms the sides of the inner bank, which is also inhabited by zoysia sinica, \"Kummerowia stipulacea\", \"Rhynchosia volubilis\", and other plant life. Within of the outer parts of the bank, plants such as \"Erigeron bonariensis\" and \"Echinochloa crus-galli\" endure the salty environment relatively well.\n\nThe \"Phragmites communis\" community extends more and more as a dominant species of Suncheon Bay, developing and forming a ring shape in several areas of the reeds. \"Suaeda asparagoides\" grows well on the dry ground of the lower part of the bank, and groups of \"Aster tripolium\" and \"Plantago maritima\" grow well near watercourses or puddles. The \"Phragmites communis\" and \"Suaeda japonica\" communities grow as dominant species in farmlands and fields.\n\nThe beginning of Suncheon Bay contains a densely spread community of \"Phragmites communis\" approximately 300,000 pyeong in size, which is more than 30 years old. This community has been growing more quickly within the past 10 years. Other \"Phragmites communis\" communities in Korea have been destroyed, but the community of Suncheon Bay is the widest and most well-preserved.\n\nThe \"Phragmites communis\" community has an outstanding purifying function and provides a productive environment for \"Boleophthalmus pectinirostris\", which is very sensitive to pollution. It plays a role not only as a natural sanitation facility of Suncheon Bay, but also controls flooding. It blocks the cold wind, which attracts fish, as well as birds that eat these fish. The \"Phragmites communis\" community has become a habitat of various species of rare birds.\n\nApproximately 158 species of birds inhabit Suncheon Bay, including 15 species of natural monument, six endangered species specified by the Ministry of Environment, 13 species of preserved species, 12 species of IUCN Red List, 16 species of CITES annex, and 15 species in Ramsar Convention.\n\nOf the world's total population, more than 1% of \"Grus monacha\" and \"Larus saundersi\", 18% of \"Tadorna tadorna\", and 7% of \"Çalidris alpina\" inhabit the Suncheon Bay area. These are international preserved species.\n\nThe dominant species are \"Anas acuta\", \"Tadorna tadorna\", \"Anas platyrhynchos\", \"Aythya marila\" mariloides, \"Aythya fuligula\"and \"Anser alvifrons\". Scolopacidae, plover such as \"Calidris alpina\", and \"Charadrius alexandrinus\" use the Suncheon Bay for their hibernation area.\n\nOther visiting species to the area include \"Grus vipio\", \"Platalea minor\", \"Ciconia boyciana\", \"Falco tinnunculus\" interstinctus, \"Microsarcops cinereus\", and \"Haematopus ostralegus\" osculans.\n\nSuncheon Bay is home to many marine resources. Inhabitants include various groups of organisms, from a microbes to higher lifeforms, including a total of 43 species of benthos, a community of organisms which live on, in or near the seabed. The density of inhabitation is about 300 individuals per 0.1 m.\n\nBivalve mollusks, such as \"Neanthes japonica\", \"Sinonovacula constricta\", \"Cyclina sinensis\", \"Megangulus venulosus\", and glaucinomyachinensis, are widely spread throughout the middle and lower beaches.\n\nThe Suncheon Bay Eco-Museum, created in Haeryong-myeon and Byeolang-myeon, Dosa-dong, Suncheon-si is composed of Ecology Hall in the central facility zone, Yongsan Observatory overlooking Suncheon Bay, and small parks with the hem of Unmyong and Waon.\n\nThe Eco-Museum created in the central facility zone contains organized \"Phragmites communis\", beaches and birds. It preserves various ecological resources and encourages academic research of resources and the ecological study by students and the general population. Indoor facilities include a plan exhibition room, main exhibition room, movie room, ecology classroom and seminar room. Outdoor facilities include the beach experience course nearby that can be used as an ecology study course for students and the general population, in addition to overview and sunset over Suncheon Bay.\n\nThe natural ecological value of Suncheon Bay is represented by the habitation of migratory or passage birds, a measure of the productivity value of the swamp. \"Numenius madagascariensis\", or Far Eastern curlew, loses half of its weight during its migratory flight non-stop from Australia. It recovers while staying at Suncheon Bay for two weeks before flying on to Siberia. It visits the Suncheon Bay area for its rich food supply.\nThe area's wide \"Suaeda japonica\" community and \"Phragmites communis\" community becomes a shelf providing a supply of food. The birds also catch food in the nearby field.\n\nWinter passage birds that make a stopover in Suncheon Bay include \"Grus monacha\", \"Anser albifrons\", \"Tadorna tadorna\", \"Anas penelope\" linnaeusm, \"Anas crecca\", \"Anas platyrhynchos\", \"Anas acuta\", \"Mergus serrator\", \"Mergus mergansercircus\" cyaneus, \"Coturnix coturnix\", \"Grus vipio\", \"Vanellus vanellus\", \"Calidris alpina\", \"Numenius arquata\", \"Larus saundersi\", \"Larus ridibundus\", \"Larus argentatus\", \"Motacilla grandis\", \"Prunella nontanella\" badia, \"Motacilla grandis\" and \"Turdus eunomus\".\n\nSummer passage birds of the Suncheon Bay area include \"Nycticorax nycticorax\", \"Bubulcus ibis\", \"Egretta garzetta\", \"Egretta alba modesta\", \"Ardea cinerea\", \"Charadrius dubius\" curonicus, \"Alcedo atthis\" bengalensis, \"Motacilla cinerea\" robusta, \"Motacilla alba\" and \"Acrocephalus arundinaceus\".\n\nOf the spring and fall passage birds to Suncheon Bay, approximately 15,000 crane plovers pass through annually. There are 10 species that comprise 1% or more of Ramsar Convention joining requirements: \"Pluvialis squatarola\" (1%), \"Calidris alpina(\"7%), \"Numenius phaeopus\" (1%), \"Tringa nebularia\" (1%), \"Tringa guttifer\" (2%), \"Xenus cinereus\" (3%), \"Tringa brevipes\" (1%), \"Limosa lapponica\" (1%), \"Numenius arquata\" (2%), and \"Charadrius alexandrinus\" (1%).\n\nThe north-to-south coast of Korea follows a rough line. Because of its geological feature forming a long gulf, the tide range is very large, which forms a long beach. This beach of Korea is one of the top five longest beaches, along with the eastern coast of Canada, eastern and northern coasts of North America, and the Amazon River area.\n\nThe beach of Suncheon Bay is approximately 3,000 years old, with and approximately 8 million pyeong of preserved natural areas providing a habitat for various creatures. It is an internationally preserved habitat for rare passage birds. The beach, a neutral zone connecting land and sea, provides a habitat and spawning grounds for various fish and shellfish. More than 60% of the total fish catch for the area is produced from beach, and one third of creatures facing extermination are known to inhabit the beach.\n\nVarious species, including 230 species of fish, 193 species of crab, 74 species of shrimp and 58 species of shellfish live in the beach habitat. The variety of creatures inhabiting this area is due to the rich nutrient salt, which provides high productivity. According to \"Nature\", a science magazine published in England, the ecological value of the beach is US$9,990 per 1§µ(0.01§´). It shows a higher value than farmland, which has an ecological value of US$92. It is an ecologic value of centuple.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment of Korea evaluates the ecological value of the Korean beach as US$24.315, because Korean beach is a habitat for creatures where marine goods are produced, which is a higher value compared to foreign nations. The beach of Suncheon Bay has been evaluated to have productivity converse to the economic value of approximately 24,500,000,000 won annually.\n\nThe total area of the \"Phragmites communis\" field in Suncheon Bay is approximately 300,000 pyeong. It covers over Gyoryang-dong, Daedae-dong and Junghueng-ri, Haechang-ri, Seonhak-ri and Haeryong-myeon of Suncheon-si.\n\nEach side of the long watercourse joining Dongcheon and Isacheon to the rivermouth is completely covered with a field of \"Phragmites communis\", the biggest \"Phragmites communis\" community in Korea. Its balls of seeds turn silver in the sunlight. The \"Phragmites communis\" field is both a habitat for marine creatures and a key to the maintenance of the swamp ecosystem.\n\nSuncheon Bay maintains its clean ecosystem with the help of the large community of \"Phragmites communis\" of 300,000 pyeong.\nThe root of \"Phragmites communis\" accelerates the growth of bacteria, which filters and absorbs solids. The stem and leaves of \"Phragmites communis\" obstruct the growth of seaweed and slows down the wind on the water's surface. It transmits oxygen from the atmosphere into water to the submerged parts of the plants, heightening the quantity of oxygen necessary to dissolve organic matters in the water to purify and improve the water quality. Oxygen discharged from the roots of \"Phragmites communis\" oxidizes soil in a resolving state, and promotes the activation and dissolution of nearby microorganisms. The wide \"Phragmites communis\" field provides an environment for the microorganism group to inhabit so that it dissolves and disperses various types of polluting substances.\n\nThe swampy area of Suncheon Bay Ecological Park is the most productive life supporting ecosystem in the area. The protection of it is very important for biological, hydrological, and economic reasons. In many areas around the world, swamps are damaged due to factors including irrigation, reclamation and pollution.\n\nTo stop the damage to swamps, international and technological conferences sponsored by the International Waterfowl & Wetlands Research Bureau (IWRB) were conducted in 1960. As the result of conferences, a convention was joined in Ramsar, Iran on February 2, 1971. The establishment of the Ramsar Convention helped establish a convention on wetlands of international importance especially as waterfowl habitats. Korea joined this convention on July 28, 1997, as the 101st member. Young Swamp of Daeam Mountain in Inje-gun, Gangwon-do and Upo Swamp in Changnyeong-gun, Gyeongnam are registered as Ramsar Swamps.\n\nSuncheon Bay began to gain attention for its waterfowl population and enlisted into the Ramsar Convention. It satisfies the \"various kinds of birds requiring different types of habitat inhabiting\" part of the Ramsar Conventions, making Suncheon Bay strong candidate to become a Ramsar Swamp. Suncheon Bay was designated as a swamp preserving area of Korea in December 2003, and it joined the international network for protection of the crane in northeastern Asia in 2004. The Northeastern Crane Network was organized as a protection strategy of Asian and Pacific passage birds at the 6th Ramsar Convention conference in 1996.\n\nThe Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries of Korea will request registration of Suncheon Bay as a Ramsar swamp in August or September 2013. If it becomes a Ramsar swamp, the natural environment of Suncheon Bay and its ecosystem will be better preserved.\n\nSuncheon Bay is one of the fifth-largest tidal flats in the world, an international wetland that attracted approximately 2.8 million visitors in 2008. The methodology for the design of the Suncheon International Wetlands Center began with the concept of leading visitors through the wetlands to the Suncheon Bay. The imprint of the receding tide water becomes the concept for this design.\n\nThe visitor’s center is placed at the northeast corner of the site, identified with meandering pathways which encourage and direct visitors to experience the wetlands and outdoor exhibits. The design of these pathways allows visitors to experience the topographical change of the site from forest to wetland. The placement of the building maximizes both the picturesque views to the mountains beyond and to the river, creating a visual continuation of both the water’s path and visitor’s circulation.\n\nThe buildings and pathways are designed to minimally affect the natural order of the protected wetland. Recesses in the pathways around the building allow for the wetland to continue under the structures. Building functions are separated into distinctly different envelops to allow for greater climatic control and lessen the overall energy usage. The green roof continues the language of the mountains beyond, allowing the gallery interior unobstructed views of nature. The wooden façade is intended to minimize summer sun exposure, maximize potential winter daylight and blend in with the surrounding woodland to the north. Framed views from the gallery through these wooden slats capture light and help set the mood for the visitor’s center.\n\nProviding connectivity to the 2013 Garden Expo, and the greater city of Suncheon, this design intends to reconnect visitors to nature and a network of facilities designed to teach them about wetland preservation.\n"}

It ran for twenty-one weeks and proved to be very popular with expatriates living in France.\n\nSlattery and McKinnes regularly began the show at 5pm and finished at 7pm with a handover to Patrick Martinez. \"The Flattery Show\" was a music-based programme that included light-hearted banter and whimsical jokes by the hosts. Listeners' views and comments were discussed and there were rotating segments such as \"Song of The Week\", \"Ask a Frenchie\" and \"Life in the South-West\". To keep listeners on their toes, random topics were picked from a big \"Bag O' Topics\".\n\nThe show ran interviews with regular and/or rotating guests, dealing with subjects of both local interest and of general interest to the expatriate community. The first people to be interviewed on the show were the English sisters Marcha King and Sian Cash, former proprietors of the landmark café \"Bar Memory\" in the Hautes-Pyrénées town of Castelnau-Magnoac. They recounted humorous stories of their years behind the bar at the French café. The interview proved enormously popular with English-speaking listeners in France and it served to create a pattern of jesting and buffoonery that would become an underlying trait of later interviews.\n\nThe show relied heavily on e-mailed material sent in by listeners that was then read out on air.

{"id": "34028512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34028512", "title": "Tropical Atlantic SST Dipole", "text": "Tropical Atlantic SST Dipole\n\nThe Tropical Atlantic SST Dipole refers to a cross-equatorial sea surface temperature (SST) pattern that appears dominant on decadal timescales. It has a period of about 12 years, with the SST anomalies manifesting their most pronounced features around 10–15 degrees of latitude off of the Equator. The term \"Tropical Atlantic SST dipole\" is only one of the characteristic names used to refer to this mode of variability; other definitions include \" the interhemispheric SST gradient\" or \"the Meridional Atlantic mode\". This decadal-scale SST pattern constitutes one of the key features of SST variability in the Tropical Atlantic Ocean, with another one being the Atlantic Equatorial Mode or \"Atlantic Niño\", which occurs in the zonal (east-west) direction at interannual timescales, with sea surface temperature and heat content anomalies being observed in the eastern equatorial basin. Its importance in climate dynamics and decadal-scale climate prediction is evident when investigating its impact on adjacent continental regions such as the Northeast Brazil, the Sahel as well as its influence on North Atlantic cyclogenesis.\n\nEarly studies have focused their attention on the connection between the enhancement (decrease) of tropical rainfall in regions such as the Northeast Brazil, the Western Sub-Saharan Africa etc. and perturbations in the tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures (Moura and Shukla (1981), Nobre and Shukla (1996).) Such research efforts have concentrated on the role of the interhemispheric (meridional) SST mode as a dynamical driver of the tropical Atlantic overlying atmosphere, by analyzing perturbations of this coupled tropical ocean-atmosphere system while examining local as well as remote influences (i.e. the tropical -mid-latitude N. Atlantic connection (Tanimoto and Xie (1999), Tourre et al. (1999)), the tropical Pacific influence via El Nino/La Nina events (Enfield and Mayer (1997)). Other studies, however, such as the ones carried out by Houghton and Tourre (1992) and Enfield and Mayer (1997), have questioned the very existence of this interhemispheric gradient (or SST dipole) as a statistical mode of climate variability. These studies suggest that the principal component analysis used to analyze the tropical Atlantic variability (TAV) and extract these statistical SST modes imposes a constraint on the analysis (due to the requirement of the orthogonality of the principal components that are associated with the different SST modes), without which the connection between the SST anomaly patterns in the Northern and Southern hemispheres appears to be insignificant.\n\nRuiz-Barradas et al. (2001) proposed that the aforementioned controversy potentially exists due to the fact that most of the previously-cited studies have attempted to identify tropical Atlantic SST patterns of variability based solely on ocean data, instead of making use of a combined analysis of observed or modeled perturbations in both the ocean and the atmosphere. Following such an additive approach, Ruiz-Barradas et al. noted that a positive Northern Hemisphere (NH) SST anomaly is associated with a northward, wind-stress anomaly and a subsequent cyclonic (counterclockwise) circulation in the subtropics, which interferes with the background flow easterlies; the opposite is true for the southern hemisphere, where the wind stress anomaly acts to enhance the south-easterlies. Such interference with the background flow subsequently leads to a decrease (enhancement) of the heat fluxes from the ocean toward the atmosphere and therefore an intensification of the positive(negative) SST anomalies, in the warm (cool) hemisphere.\n\nOther discernible features of the interhemispheric dipole noted in the aforementioned study, include a strengthened, anomalous downwelling in the hemisphere that is characterized by positive SST anomalies and a respective, less prevalent upwelling in the negative SST anomalies-hemisphere. Furthermore, diabatic heating perturbations are also shown to be linked to cross-equatorial SST changes, with positive anomalies being observed over the warmer Northern hemisphere waters and negative ones over the Southern hemisphere. A strong connection is also found between the tropical Atlantic SST dipole and the overlying atmosphere; enhanced convective patterns and anomalous precipitation appear correlated with warm NH SSTs, whereas the opposite phase is observed across the equator, over the cooler SH waters. Finally, a connection is discerned between the surface and sub-surface interhemispheric pattern-related SSTs. Northern SST anomalies appear to permeate vertically below the ocean surface reaching thermocline (THC) depths and inciting in this way THC anomalies of up to 3m. This provides additional evidence of the critical role of surface ocean currents in transporting warm waters and heat meridionally, since surface wind-induced Ekman puming appears to be the key contributor for such THC and heat content anomalies.\n\nThe meridional (interhemispheric) mode demonstrates seasonal changes, arriving to a maximum during the boreal spring, on and north of the equator. The seasonal changes in surface wind forcing, which are closely linked to the seasonal displacement of the ITCZ, incite a response on the ocean surface, affecting current systems in the tropical Atlantic as well as the slope of the underlying thermocline (THC). For example, during the Southern hemisphere spring and summer months (November–April), when the south trade winds are weak and the ITCZ is displaced further to the south, there is enhanced flow to the north along the coast of South America via the North Brazil Current (NBO); this helps transport additional heat further to the north. The Atlantic ITCZ is very sensitive to even small changes in the interhemispheric SST gradient due to the fact that tropical SSTs are very uniform in magnitude throughout the equatorial region between -. Therefore, even a small change in the SST field can cause a significant impact on the position and displacement of the ITCZ. Such shifts, along with the associated development of the equatorial cold tongue, are features of the seasonal climate that are essential to the formation and evolution of the interannual and decadal tropical Atlantic variability (TAV).\n\nA strong seasonality is also observed with respect to the remote, North Pacific influence in the tropical Atlantic, via ENSO events that induce western equatorial wind stress anomalies (WEA), which in return modulate the tropical Atlantic Ocean-atmosphere dynamics. During an ENSO warm event, the sea level pressure is lower than normal over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific and greater than normal over the tropical Atlantic. This leads to a diminished, meridional pressure gradient in both basins, consistent with a reduction in the background easterly wind flow. The decrease of meridional pressure gradient is enhanced by a low pressure center that develops during the boreal winter over the southwestern N. Atlantic, resulting, thus, to a lagged (by about one season with respect to the tropical Pacific SST maximum) maximum warming of the northern hemisphere tropical Atlantic during the boreal spring.\n\nNortheastern Brazil is one of the key regions that are severely affected by the meridional mode of tropical Atlantic SST variability. More specifically, an anomalous displacement of the ITCZ toward the north (south) leads to anomalous rainfall patterns and thus significant drying (wetting) over NE Brazil; this is also associated with a pattern of anomalous warm (cold) SST in the northern tropical Atlantic and with directly opposite conditions across the southern tropical Atlantic. Similarly, the Tropical Atlantic SST dipole is shown to impact the climate of West Saharan Africa, causing major droughts, such as the one in 1914 and during the 1968–1974 time period. Such extreme events have drastic effects on the land use as well as directly on human life.\n\nOther consequences of the Tropical Atlantic SST dipole include modulation of the strength and frequency of the Atlantic hurricanes via a series of mechanisms: a. enhancement of easterly wave propagation during the positive phase of the SST dipole (associated with a wetter West Saharan Africa and increased convective activity which in retrospect promotes a greater N. Atlantic hurricane activity), b. influence on moist static stability and vertical wind shear, c. modulation of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) by changing the subtropical surface pressure patterns, and thus affecting tropical- extratropical, ocean-atmosphere processes that are vital for the development or the weakening of North Atlantic hurricanes.\n\n\n"}

In 1901 he emigrated to Australia to become overseer-in-charge of the Australian branch.\n\nIn September 1905, Dowie suffered a stroke and recuperated in Jamaica, claiming $2,000 a month expenses from the investments, and asked Voliva to return to oversee the city in his absence. Voliva arrived in February 1906, whereupon the congregation revolted against Dowie's leadership, accusing him of corruption and polygamy, and elected Voliva as head of the church, which he then renamed to the \"Christian Catholic Apostolic Church.\" By careful management he rescued Zion from bankruptcy, gaining the support of the church members. He kept tight control on his some 6,000 followers, which made up the community, even up to the point of dictating their choice of marriage partners. The city of Zion was effectively controlled by the church; all of its real estate, while sold at market rates, was conveyed under a 1,100 year lease, subject to many restrictions and to termination at the whim of the General Overseer. Religions other than the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church were effectively banned – visiting preachers from rival sects were harassed and hounded out of town by the city police force.\n\nVoliva diversified Zion Industries, an industrial concern owned by the church that manufactured Scottish lace, to include a bakery which produced the popular Zion brand fig bar cookies and White Dove chocolates. Zion was a one-company town and its workers were paid substandard wages.\n\nVoliva introduced many new rules for members and notices were placed around the town with stern warnings that the independents (who didn't belong to the church) resented and often burned. But the city was established as a safe space for those within its boundaries.\n\nFrom 1914, Voliva gained nationwide notoriety by his vigorous advocacy of the flat earth doctrine. He offered a widely publicized $5000 challenge for anyone to disprove the flat earth theory. The church schools in Zion taught the flat earth doctrine. In 1923 Voliva became the first evangelical preacher in the world to own his own radio station, WCBD, which could be heard as far away as Central America. His radio station broadcast his diatribes against round earth astronomy, and the evils of evolution. He was quoted about the sun as follows:\n\nHe became increasingly focused on destroying the 'trinity of evils': modern astronomy, evolution and higher criticism, insisting on a strict interpretation of 24-hour days for creation and travelling to Dayton, Tennessee, to appear as a witness at the Scopes trial (he wasn't called). Voliva also predicted the end of the world would come in 1923, 1927, 1930, 1934 and 1935.\n\nLike his predecessor, Voliva increasingly developed an overtly lavish lifestyle, amassing a $5m personal fortune by 1927, which began to alienate his followers, especially after the hardships brought on by the Great Depression, which forced Zion Industries into bankruptcy. In 1935 Voliva tried to revive the flagging fortunes of the church by instituting the annual Zion Passion Play, along the lines of the famous one in Oberammergau. However, in 1937, a disgruntled employee set ablaze the church's huge Shiloh Tabernacle, where the play took place. Shortly thereafter, Voliva was forced into personal bankruptcy and he was reduced to being the honorary president of Zion Industries. The governance of the city reverted to the independents and the new authorities selected a globe for the compulsory car sticker that Voliva was forced to put on his car. He spent most of his time in Florida where he hoped to establish another fundamentalist colony, but in 1942 after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, Voliva made a tearful public confession to his followers that he had misappropriated church funds for his personal use and committed other misdeeds. He died shortly thereafter on October 11, 1942 (though he had previously stated that he would live to 120 due to his diet of Brazil nuts and buttermilk), and the church all but dissolved. A small remnant was reorganized under the leadership of Michael Mintern. It was later renamed to \"Christ Community Church.\"\n\n"}

The fractionation can arise from kinetic, equilibrium, or mass-independent fractionation.\n\nForaminifera shells are composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO) and are found in many common geological environments. The ratio of O to O in the shell is used to indirectly determine the temperature of the surrounding water at the time the shell was formed. The ratio varies slightly depending on the temperature of the surrounding water, as well as other factors such as the water's salinity, and the volume of water locked up in ice sheets.\n\nSimilarly, when water vapor condenses, heavier water molecules holding O atoms tend to condense and precipitate first. The water vapor gradient heading from the tropics to the poles gradually becomes more and more depleted of O. Snow falling in Canada has much less HO than rain in Florida; similarly, snow falling in the center of ice sheets has a lighter signature than that at its margins, since heavier O precipitates first.\n\nChanges in climate that alter global patterns of evaporation and precipitation therefore change the background ratio.\n\nBased on the simplifying assumption that the signal can be attributed to temperature change alone, with the effects of salinity and ice volume change ignored, Epstein et al. (1953) estimated that \na increase of 0.22‰ is equivalent to a cooling of 1 °C (or 1.8 °F). \nMore precisely, Epstein et al. (1953) give a quadratic extrapolation for the temperature, as \nwhere \"T\" is the temperature in °C (based on a least-squares fit for a range of temperature values between 9 °C and 29 °C, with a standard deviation of ±0.6 °C, and δ is δO for a calcium carbonate sample).\n\nLisiecki and Raymo (2005) used measurements of δO in benthic foraminifera from 57 globally distributed deep sea sediment cores, taken as a proxy for the total global mass of glacial ice sheets, to reconstruct the climate for the past five million years.\n\nThe stacked record of the 57 cores was orbitally tuned to an orbitally driven ice model, the Milankovitch cycles of 41 ky (obliquity), 26 ky (precession) and 100 ky (eccentricity), which are all assumed to cause orbital forcing of global ice volume. Over the past million years, there have been a number of very strong glacial maxima and minima, spaced by roughly 100 ky.\nAs the observed isotope variations are similar in shape to the temperature variations recorded for the past 420 ky at Vostok Station, the figure shown on the right aligns the values of δO (right scale) with the reported temperature variations from the Vostok ice core (left scale), following Petit et al. (1999).\n\n\n"}
