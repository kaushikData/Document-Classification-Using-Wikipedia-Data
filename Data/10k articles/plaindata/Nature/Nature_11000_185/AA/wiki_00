{"id": "1375256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1375256", "title": "American Expeditionary Force, North Russia", "text": "American Expeditionary Force, North Russia\n\nThe American Expeditionary Force, North Russia (AEF in North Russia) (also known as the Polar Bear Expedition) was a contingent of about 5,000 United States Army troops that landed in Arkhangelsk, Russia as part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War and fought the Red Army in the surrounding region during the period of September 1918 through to July 1919.\n\nThe U.S. President Woodrow Wilson sent the Polar Bear Expedition to Russia in response to requests from the governments of Great Britain and France to join the Allied Intervention in North Russia (also known as the North Russia Campaign). The British and French had two objectives for this intervention:\n\n\nOn July 14, 1918, the U.S. Army's 85th Division left their training camp at Camp Custer, Michigan for the Western Front in France. Three days later, President Wilson agreed to a limited participation by American troops in the Allied Intervention with the stipulation that they would only be used for guarding the stockpiled war material. When U.S. Army General John J. Pershing received the directive from President Wilson, he changed the orders for the 339th Infantry Regiment, along with the First Battalion of the 310th Engineers plus a few other ancillary units from the 85th Division. Instead of heading for France, these units were trained and re-outfitted in England with Russian guns and then sent to North Russia. They arrived in Arkhangelsk on September 4, 1918, coming under British command. (Allied expeditionary forces had occupied Arkhangelsk on August 2, 1918.)\n\nSee American Expeditionary Force, Siberia for information on the 7,950 American soldiers and officers sent to Vladivostok, Russia at the same time.\n\nWhen the British commanders of the Allied Intervention arrived in Arkhangelsk on August 2, 1918, they discovered that the Allied war material had already been moved up the Dvina River by the retreating Bolshevik forces. Therefore, when the American troops arrived one month later, they were immediately used in offensive operations to aid in the rescue of the Czech Legion. The British commanders sent the First Battalion of the 339th Infantry up the Dvina River and the Third Battalion of the 339th up the Vologda Railroad where they engaged and pushed back the Bolshevik forces for the next six weeks.\n\nHowever, these two fronts each became hundreds of miles (kilometers) long and were extremely narrow and difficult to supply, maintain, and protect. By the end of October 1918, they were no longer able to maintain the offensive and acknowledging their fragile situation and the rapid onset of winter, the Allies began to adopt a defensive posture.\n\nThe Allied commanders soon also soon realized they would be unable to raise an effective local force of anti-Bolshevik soldiers. Thus they gave up the goal of linking up with the Czech Legion and settled in to hold their gains over the coming winter. During that winter, the Bolshevik army went on the offensive, especially along the Vaga River portion of the Dvina River Front, where they inflicted numerous casualties and caused the Allies to retreat a considerable distance.\n\nDuring their time in North Russia, the American forces suffered more than 210 casualties, including at least 110 deaths from battle, about 30 missing in action, and 70 deaths from disease, 90% of which were caused by the Spanish Flu. A October 1919 report gives the casualties as 553: 109 killed in battle; 35 died of wounds; 81 from disease; 19 from accidents/other causes; 305 wounded and 4 POWS (released).\n\nFollowing the Allied Armistice with Germany on November 11, 1918, family members and friends of the AEF in North Russia soldiers began writing letters to newspapers and circulating petitions to their representatives in the U.S. Congress asking for the immediate return of the force from North Russia. In turn, the newspapers editorialized for their withdrawal and their Congressmen raised the issue in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, aware of not only the change in their mission, but also of the Armistice on the Western Front and the fact that the port of Arkhangelsk was now frozen and closed to shipping, the morale of the American soldiers plummeted. They asked their officers why they were fighting Bolshevik soldiers in Russia and did not receive a clear answer, other than that they had to fight to survive and avoid the Bolshevik army pushing them into the Arctic Ocean.\nEarly in 1919, instances of rumored and actual mutinies in the Allied ranks became frequent. President Wilson directed his War Department on February 16, 1919 to begin planning the AEF in North Russia's withdrawal from North Russia. In March 1919, four American soldiers in Company B of the 339th Infantry drew up a petition protesting their continued presence in Russia and were threatened with court-martial proceedings. U.S. Army Brigadier General Wilds P. Richardson arrived in Arkhangelsk aboard the icebreaker \"Canada\" on April 17, 1919, with orders from General Pershing to organize a coordinated withdrawal of the American troops \"...at the earliest possible moment.\" On May 26, 1919, the first half of 8,000 volunteer members of the British North Russian Relief Force arrived in Arkhangelsk to relieve the American troops. In early June, the bulk of the AEF in North Russia sailed for Brest, France and then for New York City and home—which for two-thirds of them was in the state of Michigan. During the withdrawal, the men of the AEF in North Russia decided to call themselves \"Polar Bears\" and were authorized to wear the Polar Bear insignia on their left sleeve. The AEF in North Russia officially disbanded on August 5, 1919.\n\nSeveral years after the American troops were withdrawn from Russia, President Warren G. Harding called the expedition a mistake and blamed the previous administration.\n\nA year after all of the expedition members had returned home, in 1920 Polar Bear veterans began lobbying their state and Federal governments to obtain funds and the necessary approvals to retrieve the bodies of at least 125 of their fellow American soldiers which were then believed to have been buried in Russia and left behind. By that time, 112 sets of remains had already been transferred to the United States. By 1929, additional research found that 226 fallen \"polar bears\" had originally been buried in North Russia,\nwith a total of approximately 130 sets of U.S. soldier remains then estimated to still be buried in North Russia. Hampered by the lack of diplomatic recognition between the United States and the Soviet Union, it took many years before they finally received permission. An expedition under the auspices of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) was successful in organizing and conducting a recovery mission in the autumn of 1929 that found, identified and brought out the remains of 86 U.S. soldiers. Fourteen remains of AEF in North Russia soldiers were shipped by the Soviet Union to the U.S. in 1934, which reduced the number of U.S soldiers still buried in North Russia to about 30.\n\nThe remains of 56 AEF in North Russia soldiers were eventually re-buried in plots surrounding the Polar Bear Memorial by sculptor Leon Hermant in White Chapel Memorial Cemetery, Troy, Michigan in a ceremony on May 30, 1930.\n\nHarold Gunnes, who was born in 1899, died on March 11, 2003. Gunnes was believed to have been the last living American to have fought in the Allied Intervention near the port of Arkhangelsk on the White Sea.\n\n\n"}

The advantage of ALS over conventional steady-state light scattering methods is that it allows separation of molecules/macromolecules on a chromatography column prior to analysis with light scattering detectors.

{"id": "21954698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21954698", "title": "Behemoth", "text": "Behemoth\n\nBehemoth (; , \"behemot\") is a beast mentioned in . Suggested identities range from a mythological creature to an elephant, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, or buffalo. Metaphorically, the name has come to be used for any extremely large or powerful entity.\n\nJob 40:15–24 describes Behemoth, and then the sea-monster Leviathan, to demonstrate to Job the futility of questioning God, who alone has created these beings and who alone can capture them. C. L. Patton lists several interpretations of the nature of these beasts, including the idea that they are chaos monsters destroyed by the deity at the time of creation.\n\nLeviathan is identified figuratively with both the primeval sea (, ) and in apocalyptic literature – describing the end-time – as that adversary, the Devil, from before creation who will finally be defeated. In the divine speeches in Job, Behemoth and Leviathan may both be seen as composite and mythical creatures with enormous strength, which humans like Job could not hope to control. But both are reduced to the status of divine pets, with rings through their noses and Leviathan on a leash.\n\nIn Jewish apocrypha and pseudepigrapha such as the 2nd century BCE Book of Enoch, Behemoth is the primal unconquerable monster of the land, as Leviathan is the primal monster of the waters of the sea and Ziz the primordial monster of the sky. According to this text Leviathan lives in \"the Abyss\", while Behemoth the land-monster lives in an invisible desert east of the Garden of Eden (1 Enoch 60:7–8). \n\nA Jewish rabbinic legend describes a great battle which will take place between them at the end of time: \"...they will interlock with one another and engage in combat, with his horns the Behemoth will gore with strength, the fish [Leviathan] will leap to meet him with his fins, with power. Their Creator will approach them with his mighty sword [and slay them both].\" Then, \"from the beautiful skin of the Leviathan, God will construct canopies to shelter the righteous, who will eat the meat of the Behemoth and the Leviathan amid great joy and merriment.\" (\"Artscroll\" siddur, p. 719).\n\nIn the Haggadah, Behemoth's strength reaches its peak on the summer solstice of every solar year (around 21 June). At this time of year, Behemoth lets out a loud roar that makes all animals tremble with fear, and thus renders them less ferocious for a whole year. As a result, weak animals live in safety away from the reach of wild animals. This mythical phenomenon is shown as an example of divine mercy and goodness. Without Behemoth's roar, traditions narrate, animals would grow more wild and ferocious, and hence go around butchering each other and humans.\n\nSince the 17th century CE there have been many attempts to identify Behemoth. Some scholars have seen him as a real creature, usually the hippopotamus, occasionally the elephant, rhinoceros, or water buffalo. The reference to Behemoth's \"tail\" that \"moves like a cedar\" presents a problem for most of these readings, since it cannot easily be identified with the tail of any animal. Biologist Michael Bright suggests that the reference to the cedar tree actually refers to the brush-like shape of its branches, which resemble the tails of modern elephants and hippopotamuses. \n\nSome have identified the cedar as an elephant trunk, but it might instead refer to Behemoth's penis, since the Hebrew word for \"move\" can also mean \"extend\", and the second part of the verse speaks of the sinew around his \"stones\". The Vulgate seems to endorse such a reading by using the word \"testiculorum\". Russian-language speakers have used the cognate word бегемот (\"begemot\") to refer to the hippopotamus from third quarter of the 18th century – Russian-speakers also use the name гиппопотам (\"gippopotam\").\n\nYoung Earth Creationists have argued that the behemoth may have been a sauropod-like dinosaur due to it being a large, plant-eating land animal with a long tail resembling a cedar. Young earth creationists assert that the creature's massive size and its tree-like tail eliminate the possibilities of it being an extant land animal, where they see it more akin to a large herbivorous dinosaur (such as a sauropod).\n\nAnother opinion sees Behemoth as a product of the imagination of the author of Job, a symbol of God's power: in verse 24 he is described as having a ring (\"snare\") through his nose, a sign that he has been tamed by Yahweh.\n\nThe 17th-century political philosopher Thomas Hobbes named the Long Parliament 'Behemoth' in his book \"Behemoth\". It accompanies his book of political theory that draws on the lessons of English Civil War, the rather more famous \"Leviathan\". It is also the name of a character in Mikhail Bulgakov's novel, \"The Master and Margarita\".\n\nThe Behemoth also appears in John Milton’s \"Paradise Lost\" (Book VII 470–472):\n\"\"[… ]Scarce from his mould / Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved / His vastness: Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose,[ …]\"\n\nThe Behemoth is mentioned in \"The Seasons\" by James Thomson: \n\"[…] behold ! in plaited mail / Behemoth rears his head.\"\" […] (\"Summer\"). The German émigré Franz Leopold Neumann entitled his 1941 book about National Socialism, \" \".\n\nThe Behemoth is also mentioned in the opera, \"Nixon in China\", composed by John Adams, and written by Alice Goodman. At the beginning of the first act, the chorus sings \"The people are the heroes now, Behemoth pulls the peasants' plow\" several times.\n\nIn a letter to his sister Mariana, Khalil Gibran told her that his health was \"as good as a Bahamut,\" which is thought to derive from the biblical \"Behemoth.\" \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7906908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7906908", "title": "Biomass", "text": "Biomass\n\nBiomass is waste material from plants or animals that is not used for food or feed; it can be waste from farming (like wheat stalks) or horticulture (yard waste), food processing (like corn cobs), animal farming (manure rich in nitrogen and phosphorus), or human waste from sewage plants. It is used in various industrial processes, like energy production or as raw materials for manufacturing chemicals. \n\nBurning biomass releases carbon emissions, but has been classed as a renewable energy source in the EU and UN legal frameworks, because plant stocks can be replaced with new growth. It has become popular among coal power stations, which switch from coal to biomass in order to convert to renewable energy generation without wasting existing generating plant and infrastructure. Biomass most often refers to an energy source; biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: \"thermal\", \"chemical\", and \"biochemical\". Some chemical constituents of plant biomass include lignins, cellulose, and hemicellulose.\n\nIn terms of how biomass is used as fuel, percentages were gathered in the United States of 2016. 5% is considered primary energy in the U.S. Making up that 5% of primary energy, about 48% comes from biofuels (mostly ethanol), 41% from wood based biomass, and around 11% from municipal waste. Historically, humans have harnessed biomass-derived energy since the time when people began burning wood to make fire. Even in 2018, biomass is the only source of fuel for domestic use in many developing countries. Biomass is all biologically-produced matter based in carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The estimated biomass production in the world is 104.9 petagrams (104.9 × 10 g – about 105 billion metric tons) of carbon per year, about half in the ocean and half on land. Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today; examples include forest residues (such as dead trees, branches and tree stumps), yard clippings, wood chips and even municipal solid waste. Wood energy is derived by using lignocellulosic biomass (second-generation biofuels) as fuel. Harvested wood may be used directly as a fuel or collected from wood waste streams to be processed into pellet fuel or other forms of fuels.\n\nBiomass also includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals, including biofuels. Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including miscanthus, switchgrass, hemp, corn, poplar, willow, sorghum, sugarcane, bamboo, and a variety of tree species, ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm (palm oil).\n\nBased on the source of biomass, biofuels are classified broadly into two major categories. First-generation biofuels are derived from sources such as sugarcane and corn starch. Sugars present in this biomass are fermented to produce bioethanol, an alcohol fuel which can be used directly in a fuel cell to produce electricity or serve as an additive to gasoline. However, utilizing food-based resources for fuel production only aggravates the food shortage problem. Second-generation biofuels, on the other hand, utilize non-food-based biomass sources such as agriculture and municipal waste. These biofuels mostly consist of lignocellulosic biomass, which is not edible and is a low-value waste for many industries. Despite being the favored alternative, economical production of second-generation biofuel is not yet achieved due to technological issues. These issues arise mainly due to chemical inertness and structural rigidity of lignocellulosic biomass.\n\nPlant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy. Some examples of these plants are wheat, which typically yields 7.5–8 tonnes of grain per hectare, and straw, which typically yields 3.5–5 tonnes per hectare in the UK. The grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity. Plant biomass can also be degraded from cellulose to glucose through a series of chemical treatments, and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first-generation biofuel.\n\nThe main contributors of waste energy are municipal solid waste, manufacturing waste, and landfill gas. Energy derived from biomass is projected to be the largest non-hydroelectric renewable resource of electricity in the US between 2000 and 2020.\n\nBiomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel. Rotting garbage, and agricultural and human waste, all release methane gas, also called landfill gas or biogas. Crops such as corn and sugarcane can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel ethanol. Biodiesel, another transportation fuel, can be produced from leftover food products like vegetable oils and animal fats. Several biodiesel companies simply collect used restaurant cooking oil and convert it into biodiesel. Also, biomass-to-liquids (called \"BTLs\") and cellulosic ethanol are still under research.\n\nThere is research involving algae or algae-derived biomass, as this non-food resource can be produced at rates five to ten times those of other types of land-based agriculture, such as corn and soy. Once harvested, it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol, butanol, and methane, as well as biodiesel and hydrogen. Efforts are being made to identify which species of algae are most suitable for energy production. Genetic engineering approaches could also be utilized to improve microalgae as a source of biofuel.\n\nThe biomass used for electricity generation varies by region. Forest by-products, such as wood residues, are common in the US. Agricultural waste is common in Mauritius (sugar cane residue) and Southeast Asia (rice husks). Animal husbandry residues, such as poultry litter, are common in the UK.\n\nSewage sludge can be another source of biomass. For example, the Omni Processor is a process which uses sewage sludge as fuel in a process of sewage sludge treatment, with surplus electrical energy being generated for export.\n\nIf the total annual primary production of biomass is just over 100 billion (1.0E+11) tonnes of carbon /yr, and the energy reserve per tonne of biomass is between about 1.5×10 and 3×10 kilowatt hours (5×10 and 10×10 BTU), or 24.8 TW average, then biomass could in principle provide 1.4 times the approximate annual 150×10 terawatt-hours required for current world energy consumption. For reference, the total solar power on Earth is 174 PW. The biomass equivalent to solar energy ratio is 143 ppm (parts per million), given current living system coverage on Earth. The best currently attainable solar cell efficiency is 20–40%. Additionally, Earth's internal radioactive energy production, largely the driver for volcanic activity, continental drift, etc., is in the same range of power, 20 TW. At around 50% carbon mass content in biomass, annual production, this corresponds to about 6% atmospheric carbon content in the form of CO (for the current 400 ppm).\n\n\n\n\n\nThermal conversion processes use heat as the dominant mechanism to convert biomass into another chemical form. Also known as thermal oil heating, it is a type of indirect heating in which a liquid phase heat transfer medium is heated and circulated to one or more heat energy users within a closed loop system. The basic alternatives of combustion (torrefaction, pyrolysis, and gasification) are separated principally by the extent to which the chemical reactions involved are allowed to proceed (mainly controlled by the availability of oxygen and conversion temperature). These processes reduce carbon emissions during processing of biomass while providing useful byproducts which can later be used in several applications.\n\nEnergy created by burning biomass is particularly suited for countries where the fuel wood grows more rapidly, such as in tropical countries. There are other less common, more experimental or proprietary thermal processes that may offer benefits, such as hydrothermal upgrading. Some have been developed for use on high moisture content biomass, including aqueous slurries, and allow them to be converted into more convenient forms. Some of the applications of thermal conversion are combined heat and power and co-firing. In a typical dedicated biomass power plant, efficiencies range from 20–27% (higher heating value basis). Biomass cofiring with coal, by contrast, typically occurs at efficiencies near those of the coal combustor (30–40%, higher heating value basis).\n\nA range of chemical processes may be used to convert biomass into other forms, such as to produce a fuel that is more conveniently used, transported or stored, or to exploit some property of the process itself. Many of these processes are based in large part on similar coal-based processes, such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, methanol production, olefins (ethylene and propylene), and similar chemical or fuel feedstocks. In most cases, the first step involves gasification, which step generally is the most expensive and involves the greatest technical risk.\nBiomass is more difficult to feed into a pressure vessel than coal or any liquid. Therefore, biomass gasification is frequently done at atmospheric pressure and causes combustion of biomass to produce a combustible gas consisting of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and traces of methane. This gas mixture, called a producer gas, can provide fuel for various vital processes, such as internal combustion engines, as well as substitute for furnace oil in direct heat applications. Because any biomass material can undergo gasification, this process is far more attractive than ethanol or biomass production, where only particular biomass materials can be used to produce a fuel. In addition, biomass gasification is a desirable process due to the ease at which it can convert solid waste (such as wastes available on a farm) into producer gas, which is a very usable fuel.\n\nConversion of biomass to biofuel can also be achieved via selective conversion of individual components of biomass. For example, cellulose can be converted to intermediate platform chemical such a sorbitol, glucose, hydroxymethylfurfural etc. These chemical are then further reacted to produce hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuels.\n\nBiomass also has the potential to be converted to multiple commodity chemicals. Halomethanes have successfully been by produced using a combination of A. fermentans and engineered S. cerevisiae. This method converts NaX salts and unprocessed biomass such as switchgrass, sugarcane, corn stover, or poplar into halomethanes. S-adenosylmethionine which is naturally occurring in S. cerevisiae allows a methyl group to be transferred. Production levels of 150 mg L-1H-1 iodomethane were achieved. At these levels roughly 173000 L of capacity would need to be operated just to replace the United States’ need for iodomethane. However, an advantage of this method is that it uses NaI rather than I2; NaI is significantly less hazardous than I2. This method may be applied to produce ethylene in the future.\n\nOther chemical processes such as converting straight and waste vegetable oils into biodiesel is transesterification.\n\nAs biomass is a natural material, many highly efficient biochemical processes have developed in nature to break down the molecules of which biomass is composed, and many of these biochemical conversion processes can be harnessed.\n\nBiochemical conversion makes use of the enzymes of bacteria and other microorganisms to break down biomass into gaseous or liquid fuels, such a biogas or bioethanol. In most cases, microorganisms are used to perform the conversion process: anaerobic digestion, fermentation, and composting.\n\nGlycoside hydrolases are the enzymes involved in the degradation of the major fraction of biomass, such as polysaccharides present in starch and lignocellulose. Thermostable variants are gaining increasing roles as catalysts in biorefining applications in the future bioeconomy, since recalcitrant biomass often needs thermal treatment for more efficient degradation. Some examples in today´s processing include the production of monosaccharides for food applications as well as use as a carbon source for microbial conversion into metabolites such as bioethanol and chemical intermediates, oligocaccharide production for prebiotic (nutrition) applications and production of surfactants alkyl glycoside type.\n\nIn addition to combustion, biomass/biofuels can be directly converted to electrical energy via electrochemical (electrocatalytic) oxidation of the material. This can be performed directly in a direct carbon fuel cell, direct liquid fuel cells such as direct ethanol fuel cell, a direct methanol fuel cell, a direct formic acid fuel cell, a L-ascorbic Acid Fuel Cell (vitamin C fuel cell), and a microbial fuel cell. The fuel can also be consumed indirectly via a fuel cell system containing a reformer which converts the biomass into a mixture of CO and H2 before it is consumed in the fuel cell.\n\nThe biomass power generating industry in the United States consists of approximately 11,000 MW of summer operating capacity actively supplying power to the grid, and produces about 1.4 percent of the U.S. electricity supply.\n\nPublic Service of New Hampshire (later merged with other companies into Eversource) in 2006 replaced a 50 MW coal boiler with a new 50 MW biomass boiler at its Schiller Station facility in Portsmouth, NH. The boiler's biomass fuel is from sources in NH, Massachusetts and Maine.\n\nCurrently, the New Hope Power Partnership in Palm Beach County, Florida is the largest biomass power plant in the U.S. The 140 MW facility uses sugarcane fiber (bagasse) and recycled urban wood as fuel to generate enough power for its large milling and refining operations as well as to supply electricity for nearly 60,000 homes.\n\nIn Vermont in 2017, biomass cost $85 per megawatt, and wholesale electricity was about $25 a megawatt, making biomass more expensive, particularly when compared to fracked natural gas.\n\nSecond-generation biofuels were not (in 2010) produced commercially, but a considerable number of research activities were taking place mainly in North America, Europe and also in some emerging countries. These tend to use feedstock produced by rapidly reproducing enzymes or bacteria from various sources including excrement grown in cell cultures or hydroponics. There is huge potential for second generation biofuels but non-edible feedstock resources are highly under-utilized.\n\nUsing biomass as a fuel produces air pollution in the form of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, NOx (nitrogen oxides), VOCs (volatile organic compounds), particulates and other pollutants at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as coal or natural gas in some cases (such as with indoor heating and cooking). Use of wood biomass as a fuel can also produce fewer particulate and other pollutants than open burning as seen in wildfires or direct heat applications. Black carbon – a pollutant created by combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass – is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming. In 2009 a Swedish study of the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas in South Asia determined that it had been principally produced by open burning of biomass, and to a lesser extent by fossil-fuel burning. Researchers measured a significant concentration of C (Carbon-14), which is associated with recent plant life rather than with fossil fuels.\n\nBiomass power plant size is often driven by biomass availability in close proximity as transport costs of the (bulky) fuel play a key factor in the plant's economics. Rail and especially shipping on waterways can reduce transport costs significantly, which has led to a global biomass market. To make small plants of 1 MW economically profitable those power plants need to be equipped with technology that is able to convert biomass to useful electricity with high efficiency such as ORC technology, a cycle similar to the water steam power process just with an organic working medium. Such small power plants can be found in Europe.\n\nOn combustion, the carbon from biomass is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO). The amount of carbon stored in dry wood is approximately 50% by weight. However, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, plant matter used as a fuel can be replaced by planting for new growth. When the biomass is from forests, the time to recapture the carbon stored is generally longer, and the carbon storage capacity of the forest may be reduced overall if destructive forestry techniques are employed.\n\nIndustry professionals claim that a range of issues can affect a plant's ability to comply with emissions standards. Some of these challenges, unique to biomass plants, include inconsistent fuel supplies and age. The type and amount of the fuel supply are completely reliant factors; the fuel can be in the form of building debris or agricultural waste (such as removal of invasive species or orchard trimmings). Furthermore, many of the biomass plants are old, use outdated technology and were not built to comply with today’s stringent standards. In fact, many are based on technologies developed during the term of U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who created the United States Department of Energy in 1977.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration projected that by 2017, biomass is expected to be about twice as expensive as natural gas, slightly more expensive than nuclear power, and much less expensive than solar panels. In another EIA study released, concerning the government’s plan to implement a 25% renewable energy standard by 2025, the agency assumed that 598 million tons of biomass would be available, accounting for 12% of the renewable energy in the plan.\n\nThe adoption of biomass-based energy plants has been a slow but steady process. Between the years of 2002 and 2012 the production of these plants has increased 14%. In the United States, alternative electricity-production sources on the whole generate about 13% of power; of this fraction, biomass contributes approximately 11% of the alternative production. According to a study conducted in early 2012, of the 107 operating biomass plants in the United States, 85 have been cited by federal or state regulators for the violation of clean air or water standards laws over the past 5 years. This data also includes minor infractions.\n\nDespite harvesting, biomass crops may sequester carbon. For example, soil organic carbon has been observed to be greater in switchgrass stands than in cultivated cropland soil, especially at depths below . The grass sequesters the carbon in its increased root biomass. Typically, perennial crops sequester much more carbon than annual crops due to much greater non-harvested living biomass, both living and dead, built up over years, and much less soil disruption in cultivation.\n\nThe proposal that biomass is carbon-neutral put forward in the early 1990s has been superseded by more recent science that recognizes that mature, intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than cut-over areas. When a tree's carbon is released into the atmosphere in a single pulse, it contributes to climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over decades. Current studies indicate that \"even after 50 years the forest has not recovered to its initial carbon storage\" and \"the optimal strategy is likely to be protection of the standing forest\".\n\nThe pros and cons of biomass usage regarding carbon emissions may be quantified with the ILUC factor. There is controversy surrounding the usage of the ILUC factor.\n\nForest-based biomass has recently come under fire from a number of environmental organizations, including Greenpeace and the Natural Resources Defense Council, for the harmful impacts it can have on forests and the climate. Greenpeace recently released a report entitled \"Fuelling a BioMess\" which outlines their concerns around forest-based biomass. Because any part of the tree can be burned, the harvesting of trees for energy production encourages whole-tree harvesting, which removes more nutrients and soil cover than regular harvesting, and can be harmful to the long-term health of the forest. In some jurisdictions, forest biomass removal is increasingly involving elements essential to functioning forest ecosystems, including standing trees, naturally disturbed forests and remains of traditional logging operations that were previously left in the forest. Environmental groups also cite recent scientific research which has found that it can take many decades for the carbon released by burning biomass to be recaptured by regrowing trees, and even longer in low productivity areas; furthermore, logging operations may disturb forest soils and cause them to release stored carbon. In light of the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term in order to mitigate the effects of climate change, a number of environmental groups are opposing the large-scale use of forest biomass in energy production.\n\nWith the seasonality of biomass supply and a great variability in sources, supply chains play a key role in cost-effective delivery of bioenergy. There are several potential challenges unique to bioenergy supply chains:\n\nTechnical issues\n\nLogistic issues\n\nFinancial issues\n\nSocial issues\n\nPolicy and regulatory issues\n\nInstitutional and organizational issues\n\n"}

It occupies much of West Texas, parts of the middle and lower Rio Grande Valley and the lower Pecos Valley in New Mexico, and a portion of southeastern Arizona, as well as the central and northern portions of the Mexican Plateau. It is bordered on the west by the extensive Sierra Madre Occidental range, along with northwestern lowlands of the Sierra Madre Oriental range. On the Mexican side, it covers a large portion of the state of Chihuahua, along with portions of Coahuila, north-eastern Durango, the extreme northern part of Zacatecas, and small western portions of Nuevo León. With an area of about , it is the third largest desert of the Western Hemisphere and the second largest in North America, after the Great Basin Desert.\n\nSeveral larger mountain ranges include the Sierra Madre, the Sierra del Carmen, the Organ Mountains, the Franklin Mountains, the Sacramento Mountains, the Chisos Mountains, the Guadalupe Mountains, and the Davis Mountains. These create \"sky islands\" of cooler, wetter, climates adjacent to, or within the desert, and such elevated areas have both coniferous and broadleaf woodlands, including forests along drainages and favored exposures. The Sandia-Manzano Mountains, the Magdalena-San Mateo Mountains, and the Gila Region border the Chihuahuan Desert at their lower elevations.\n\nThere are a few urban areas within the desert: the largest is Ciudad Juárez with almost two million inhabitants; Chihuahua, Saltillo, and Torreón; and the US cities of Albuquerque and El Paso. Las Cruces and Roswell are among the other significant cities in this ecoregion. Monterrey and Santa Fe are located near the Chihuahuan desert.\n\nAccording to the World Wide Fund for Nature the Chihuahuan Desert may be the most biologically diverse desert in the world as measured by species richness or endemism. The region has been badly degraded, mainly due to grazing. Many native grasses and other species have become dominated by woody native plants, including creosote bush and mesquite, due to overgrazing and other urbanization. The Mexican wolf, once abundant, was nearly extinct and remains on the endangered species list.\n\nThe desert is mainly a rain shadow desert because the two main mountain ranges covering the desert, the Sierra Madre Occidental to the west and the Sierra Madre Oriental to the east block most moisture from the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico respectively. Climatically, the desert has a dry climate with only one rainy season in the summer and smaller amounts of precipitation in early winter. Most of the summer rains falls between late June and early October, during the North American Monsoon when moist air from the Gulf of Mexico penetrates into the region. Owing to its inland position and higher elevation than the Sonoran Desert to the west, mostly varying from in altitude, the desert has a slightly milder climate in the summer (though usually daytime June temperatures are in the range of ) and cool or cold winters with occasional frosts. The average annual temperature in the desert is , which varies with altitude. The hottest temperatures in the desert occur in lower elevation areas and in valleys. Northern areas have more severe winters than the southern portion and can receive snowstorms. The mean annual precipitation for the Chihuahuan Desert is with a range of approximately , although it receives more precipitation than other warm desert ecoregions. Nearly two-thirds of the arid zone stations have annual totals between . Snowfall is scant except at the higher elevation edges. The desert is fairly young, existing for only 8000 years.\n\nCreosote bush (\"Larrea tridentata\") is the dominant plant species on gravelly and occasional sandy soils in valley areas within the Chihuahuan Desert. The other species it is found with depends on factors such as the soil, altitude, and degree of slope. Viscid acacia (\"Acacia neovernicosa\"), and tarbush (\"Flourensia cernua\") dominate northern portions, as does broom dalea (\"Psorothamnus scoparius\") on sandy soils in western portions. \"Yucca\" and \"Opuntia\" species are abundant in foothill edges and the central third, while Arizona rainbow cactus (\"Echinocereus polyacanthus\") and Mexican fire-barrel cactus (\"Ferocactus pilosus\") inhabit portions near the US–Mexico border.\n\nHerbaceous plants, such as bush muhly (\"Muhlenbergia porteri\"), blue grama (\"Bouteloua gracilis\"), gypsum grama (\"B. breviseta\"), and hairy grama (\"B. hirsuta\"), are dominant in desert grasslands and near the mountain edges including the Sierra Madre Occidental. Lechuguilla (\"Agave lechuguilla\"), honey mesquite (\"Prosopis glandulosa\"), \"Opuntia macrocentra\" and \"Echinocereus pectinatus\" are the dominant species in western Coahuila. Ocotillo (\"Fouquieria splendens\"), lechuguilla, and \"Yucca filifera\" are the most common species in the southeastern part of the desert. Candelilla (\"Euphorbia antisyphilitica\"), \"Mimosa zygophylla\", \"Acacia glandulifera\" and lechuguilla are found in areas with well-draining, shallow soils. The shrubs found near the Sierra Madre Oriental are exclusively lechuguilla, guapilla (\"Hechtia glomerata\"), Queen Victoria's agave (\"Agave victoriae-reginae\"), sotol (\"Dasylirion\" spp.), and barreta (\"Helietta parvifolia\"), while the well-developed herbaceous layer includes grasses, legumes and cacti.\n\nGrasslands comprise 20% of this desert and are often mosaics of shrubs and grasses. They include purple three-awn (\"Aristida purpurea\"), black grama (\"Bouteloua eriopoda\"), and sideoats grama (\"Bouteloua curtipendula\"). Early Spanish explorers reported encountering grasses that were \"belly high to a horse;\" most likely these were big alkali sacaton (\"Sporobolus wrightii\") and tobosa (\"Pleuraphis mutica\") bottomlands.\n\n"}

This was the first of a series of covenants made between God and the biblical patriarchs.\n\nThe biblical story in recounts the covenant of the pieces. The day started with a vision in which Abram expressed his concerns about being childless. God tells Abram that he would have a son born to him, asks him to count the stars, if possible, and promises \"So shall thy seed be.\" God commands Abram to prepare an animal sacrifice. Abram performed the sacrifice, cutting the animals (except the birds) into two pieces.\n\nAs the sun was going down, Abram fell into a deep sleep. God prophesied to Abram that his seed would be strangers in a land that is not theirs (a strange land) and serve the rulers of the land for four hundred years but afterward they would come out with \"great substance\" and in the fourth generation they would return to Canaan.\n\nYahweh declared all of the regions of land that Abram's offspring would claim: \n\nThe covenant found in is known in Hebrew as the \"Brit bein HaBetarim\", the \"Covenant Between the Parts\", and is the basis for brit milah (covenant of circumcision) in Judaism. The covenant was for Abraham and his seed, or offspring, both of natural birth and adoption.\n\nIn Genesis 12–17 three covenants (or developments of the covenant) can be distinguished. According to the documentary hypothesis these covenants are based on the differing Jahwist, Elohist and Priestly sources. In Genesis 12 and 15, God grants Abram land and descendants but does not place any stipulations (unconditional). By contrast, Gen. 17 contains the covenant of circumcision (conditional).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58677565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58677565", "title": "Eight Pillars", "text": "Eight Pillars\n\nThe Eight Pillars also known as Eight Pillars of the Sky are a concept from Chinese mythology. Located in the eight cardinal directions, they are a group of eight mountains or pillars which have been thought to hold up the sky. They are symbolically important as types of \"axis mundi\" and cosmology. Their functions in mythology ranged from pillars which functioned to hold apart the Earth and the Sky (or Heaven), as ladders allowing travel between the two, and as the location of various paradises or wonderland with associated magical people, plants, and animals. The Eight Pillars are a central aspect to Chinese mythology, and also have been used extensively in poetic allusion. Some variations exist, such as only having four pillars.\n\nVarious mythological geography is associated with the Eight Pillars, including the eight mountain pillars themselves along with surrounding or intervening terrain, such as the Moving Sands. The eight mountain pillars include Kunlun, Jade Mountain, Mount Buzhou, and five more (Yang Lihui 2005: \"passim\"). Kunlun functions as a sort of ladder which could be used to travel between earth and Heaven. Accordingly, any person who succeeded in climbing up to the top of Kunlun would magically become an immortal spirit (Yang 2005: 160-162).\n\nBuzhou was the defective mountain pillar. Having been damaged by Gonggong, it no longer separated the Earth and the Heaven for the proper distance. Bu-zhou was the northwest one (Hawkes, 1985 (2011): 94-95, 135-136, 323).\n\nKunlun Mountain has been described in various texts, as well as being depicted in art. Sometimes Kunlun appears as a pillar of the sky (or earth), sometimes appearing as being composed of multiple tiers (Yang 2005: 160), with the commonality of \"mystery, grandeur, or magnificence\" being emphasized in the mythological descriptions. The base of the Kunlun Mountain is said to penetrate as far into the earth, as its above-ground part proceeds towards the sky (Christie1968: 74). As the mythology related to the Kunlun developed, it became influenced by the later introduction of ideas about an \"axis mundi\" from the cosmology of India. The Kunlun became identified with (or took on the attributes of) Mount Sumeru. Another historical development in the mythology of Kunlun, (again with Indian influence) was that rather than just being the source of the Yellow River, Kunlun began to be considered to be the source of four major rivers flowing to the four quarters of the compass (Christie 1968:74).\n\nAnother of the Eight Pillars was Jade Mountain.\n\nVarious other mythological geography is associated with the Eight Pillars. This includes the four rivers flowing from Kunlun Mountain and the Moving Sands.\n\nVarious activities took place at the eight pillars. For one, they were often thought of as reaching from Earth to Heaven; thus, climbing one of the pillars would allow one to reach Heaven from Earth.\n\nThe eight mountain pillars were favorite places for all sorts of characters to visit or dwell. This includes various deities, immortals, and shamans.\n\nVarious deities inhabited or visited one or more of the eight mountain pillars. These include Xiwangmu and others on Kunlun.\n\nAlthough not originally located on Kunlun, but rather on a Jade Mountain neighboring to the north (and west of the Moving Sands), Xiwangmu, the Queen Mother of Meng Hao in the West, in later accounts was relocated to a palace protected by golden ramparts, within which immortals (xian) feasted on bear paws, monkey lips, and the livers of dragons, served at the edge of the Lake of Gems. Every 6000 years the peaches which conferred immortality upon those who ate them would be served (except the time when they were purloined by Monkey King). Originally a plague deity with tiger teeth and leopard tail, she became a beautiful and well-mannered goddess responsible for guarding the herb of immortality (Christie 1968: 78-79).\n\nThe immortals, or \"xian\", were Daoist immortals (humans who had metamorphosed into superhuman form). The \"xian\" were often seen as temporary residents, who visited by means of flying on the back of a magical crane or dragon.\n\nThe Wu or shamans were people that practiced divination, prayer, sacrifice, rainmaking, and healing, generally through the use of spirit flight. They generally seem to have become immortals.\n\nThe Eight Pillars are a subject of poetic allusion from the ancient poems \"Li Sao\" and \"Heavenly Questions\" by Qu Yuan; and, on through later times, in Classical Chinese poetry. The immortals, or \"Xian\", were Daoist immortals (humans who had metamorphosed into superhuman form), which was presided over by Xiwangmu. The \"xian\" were often seen as temporary residents, who visited by means of flying on the back of a magical crane or dragon.\n\n\n"}

He remained unmarried and a curate all his life. He is best known for his \"Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne\".\n\n White was born in his grandfather's vicarage at Selborne in Hampshire. He was educated at the Holy Ghost School and by a private tutor in Basingstoke before going to Oriel College, Oxford. He obtained his deacon's orders in 1746, being fully ordained in 1749, and subsequently held several curacies in Hampshire and Wiltshire, including Selborne's neighbouring parishes of Newton Valence and Farringdon, as well as Selborne itself on four separate occasions. In 1752/53 White held the office of Junior Proctor at Oxford and was Dean of Oriel. In 1757 he became non-resident perpetual curate of Moreton Pinkney in Northamptonshire. After the death of his father in 1758, White moved back into the family home at \"The Wakes\" in Selborne, which he eventually inherited in 1763. In 1784 he became curate of Selborne for the fourth time, remaining so until his death. Having studied at the more prestigious Oriel, at the behest of his uncle, he was ineligible to be considered for the permanent living of Selborne, which was in the gift of Magdalen College.\n\nWhite is regarded by many as England's first ecologist, and one of those who shaped the modern attitude of respect for nature. He said of the earthworm:\n\nEarthworms, though in appearance a small and despicable link in the chain of nature, yet, if lost, would make a lamentable chasm. [...] worms seem to be the great promoters of vegetation, which would proceed but lamely without them...\n\nWhite and William Markwick collected records of the dates of emergence of more than 400 plant and animal species, White recording in Hampshire and Markwick in Sussex between 1768 and 1793. These data, summarised in \"The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne\" as the earliest and latest dates for each event over the 25-year period, are among the earliest examples of modern phenology. \n\nAmerican nature writer, Donald C. Peattie, writes in \"The Road of a Naturalist\" about White's contribution to the public interest in birds: \"The bird census, now so widely promulgated by the Audubon Society, was the invention of Gilbert White; he was the original exponent, as far as I know, of the close seasonal observation of Nature, a branch of science known to the pedantic as phenology. He was the first to perceive the value in the study of migration (then a disputed fact) and of banding or ringing birds, though it was Audubon who first performed the experiment. No professional ornithologist ever did so much to widen interest in birds; from White's pages they cock a friendly eye at us, and hop out of his leaves right over our thresholds.\"\n\nHis 1783–84 diary corroborates the dramatic climatic impacts of the volcanic 'Laki haze' that spread from Iceland with lethal consequences across Europe.\n\nGilbert White's sister Anne was married to Thomas Barker (1722–1809), called 'The father of meteorology', and Gilbert maintained a correspondence with his nephew Samuel Barker, who also kept a naturalist's journal.\n\nWhite is best known for his \"The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne\" (1789). This is presented as a compilation of his letters to Thomas Pennant, the leading British zoologist of the day, and the Hon. Daines Barrington, an English barrister and another Fellow of the Royal Society, though a number of the 'letters' such as the first nine were never posted, and were written especially for the book. The book has been continuously in print since its first publication. It was long held, \"probably apocryphally\", to be the fourth-most published book in the English language after the Bible, the works of Shakespeare, and John Bunyan’s \"The Pilgrim’s Progress\".\n\nWhite's biographer, Richard Mabey, praises White's expressiveness:\n\nThe White family house in Selborne, \"The Wakes\", now contains the Gilbert White Museum. The Selborne Society was founded in 1895 to perpetuate the memory of Gilbert White. It purchased land by the Grand Union Canal at Perivale in West London to create the first Bird Sanctuary in Britain, known as Perivale Wood. In the 1970s, Perivale Wood became a Local Nature Reserve. This initiative was led by a group of young naturalists, notably Edward Dawson and Peter Edwards, Kevin Roberts and Andrew Duff. It was designated by Ealing Borough Council under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. Flora Thompson, the countryside novelist, said of White: \"It is easy to imagine him, this very first of English nature writers, the most sober and modest, yet happiest of men.\"\n\nWhite is quoted by Merlyn in \"The Once and Future King\" by T.H. White and in \"The Boy in Grey\" by Henry Kingsley, in which White's thrush appears as a character. A documentary about White, presented by historian Michael Wood, was broadcast by BBC Four in 2006. White is commemorated in the inscription on one of eight bells installed in 2009 at Holybourne, Hampshire and in the Perivale Wood Local Nature Reserve, which is dedicated to his memory. The Reserve is owned and managed by the Selborne Society, named to commemorate White's \"Natural History\". White's frequent accounts of a tortoise inherited from his aunt in \"The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne\" form the basis for Verlyn Klinkenborg's book, \"Timothy; or, Notes of an Abject Reptile\" (2006), and for Sylvia Townsend Warner's \"The Portrait of a Tortoise\" (1946).\n\n\n\n"}

Its roots can be traced back to the middle of the 20th century when the UKUSA Agreement was jointly enacted by the United Kingdom and the United States, which later expanded to Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to create the present Five Eyes alliance. The alliance developed cooperation arrangements with several \"third-party\" nations. Eventually, this resulted in the establishment of a global surveillance network, code-named \"ECHELON\" (1971).\n\nIts existence, however, was not widely acknowledged by governments and the mainstream media until the global surveillance disclosures by Edward Snowden triggered a debate about the right to privacy in the Digital Age.\n\nThe origins of global surveillance can be traced back to the late 1940s after the UKUSA Agreement was collaboratively enacted by the United Kingdom and the United States, which eventually culminated in the creation of the global surveillance network code-named \"ECHELON\" in 1971.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1970s Watergate affair and a subsequent congressional inquiry led by Sen. Frank Church, it was revealed that the NSA, in collaboration with Britain's GCHQ, had routinely intercepted the international communications of prominent anti-Vietnam War leaders such as Jane Fonda and Dr. Benjamin Spock. Decades later, a multi-year investigation by the European Parliament highlighted the NSA's role in economic espionage in a report entitled 'Development of Surveillance Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information', in 1999.\n\nHowever, for the general public, it was a series of detailed disclosures of internal NSA documents in June 2013 that first revealed the massive extent of the NSA's spying, both foreign and domestic. Most of these were leaked by an ex-contractor, Edward Snowden. Even so, a number of these older global surveillance programs such as PRISM, XKeyscore, and Tempora were referenced in the 2013 release of thousands of documents. Many countries around the world, including Western Allies and member states of NATO, have been targeted by the \"Five Eyes\" strategic alliance of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the USA—five English-speaking Western countries aiming to achieve Total Information Awareness by mastering the Internet with analytical tools such as the Boundless Informant. As confirmed by the NSA's director Keith B. Alexander on 26 September 2013, the NSA collects and stores all phone records of all American citizens. Much of the data is kept in large storage facilities such as the Utah Data Center, a US$1.5 billion megaproject referred to by \"The Wall Street Journal\" as a \"symbol of the spy agency's surveillance prowess.\"\n\nOn 6 June 2013, Britain's \"The Guardian\" newspaper began publishing a series of revelations by an as yet unknown American whistleblower, revealed several days later to be ex-CIA and ex-NSA-contracted systems analyst Edward Snowden. Snowden gave a cache of documents to two journalists: Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, Greenwald later estimated that the cache contains 15,000 – 20,000 documents, some very large and very detailed, and some very small. In over two subsequent months of publications, it became clear that the NSA had operated a complex web of spying programs which allowed it to intercept Internet and telephone conversations from over a billion users from dozens of countries around the world. Specific revelations were made about China, the European Union, Latin America, Iran and Pakistan, and Australia and New Zealand, however, the published documentation reveals that many of the programs indiscriminately collected bulk information directly from central servers and Internet backbones, which almost invariably carry and reroute information from distant countries.\n\nDue to this central server and backbone monitoring, many of the programs overlapped and interrelated among one another. These programs were often carried out with the assistance of US entities such as the United States Department of Justice and the FBI, was sanctioned by US laws such as the FISA Amendments Act, and the necessary court orders for them were signed by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Some of the NSA's programs were directly aided by national and foreign intelligence agencies, Britain's GCHQ and Australia's DSD, as well as by large private telecommunications and Internet corporations, such as Verizon, Telstra, Google and Facebook.\n\nSnowden's disclosures of the NSA's surveillance activities are a continuation of news leaks which have been ongoing since the early 2000s. One year after the September 11, 2001, attacks, former U.S. intelligence official William Binney, was publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens.\n\nFurther disclosures followed. On 16 December 2005, \"The New York Times\" published a report under the headline \"Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts.\" In 2006, further evidence of the NSA's domestic surveillance of U.S. citizens was provided by \"USA Today\". The newspaper released a report on 11 May 2006, regarding the NSA's \"massive database\" of phone records collected from \"tens of millions\" of U.S. citizens. According to \"USA Today\", these phone records were provided by several telecom companies such as AT&T, Verizon and BellSouth. In 2008, the security analyst Babak Pasdar revealed the existence of the so-called \"Quantico circuit\" that he and his team discovered in 2003 when brought on to update the carrier's security system. The circuit provided the U.S. federal government with a backdoor into the network of an unnamed wireless provider, which was later independently identified as Verizon.\n\nSnowden made his first contact with journalist Glenn Greenwald of \"The Guardian\" in late 2012. The timeline of mass surveillance disclosures by Snowden continued throughout the entire year of 2013.\n\nDocuments leaked by Snowden in 2013 include court orders, memos, and policy documents related to a wide range of surveillance activities.\n\nAccording to the April 2013 summary of documents leaked by Snowden, other than to combat terrorism, these surveillance programs were employed to assess the foreign policy and economic stability of other countries, and to gather \"commercial secrets\".\n\nIn a statement addressed to the National Congress of Brazil in early August 2013, journalist Glenn Greenwald maintained that the U.S. government had used counter-terrorism as a pretext for clandestine surveillance in order to compete with other countries in the \"business, industrial and economic fields\". In a December 2013 letter to the Brazilian government, Snowden wrote that \"These programs were never about terrorism: they're about economic spying, social control, and diplomatic manipulation. They're about power.\" According to White House panel member NSA didn't stop any terrorist attack. However NSA chief said, that surveillance programs stopped 54 terrorist plots.\n\nIn an interview with \"Der Spiegel\" published on 12 August 2013, former NSA Director Michael Hayden admitted that \"We (the NSA) steal secrets. We're number one in it\". Hayden also added: \"We steal stuff to make you safe, not to make you rich\".\n\nAccording to documents seen by the news agency Reuters, these \"secrets\" were subsequently funnelled to authorities across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans. Federal agents are then instructed to \"recreate\" the investigative trail in order to \"cover up\" where the information originated.\n\nAccording to the congressional testimony of Keith B. Alexander, Director of the National Security Agency, one of the purposes of its data collection is to store all the phone records inside a place that can be searched and assessed at all times. When asked by Senator Mark Udall if the goal of the NSA is to collect the phone records of all Americans, Alexander replied, \"Yes, I believe it is in the nation's best interest to put all the phone records into a lockbox that we could search when the nation needs to do it.\"\n\nIn the United States, the NSA is collecting the phone records of more than 300 million Americans. The international surveillance tool XKeyscore allows government analysts to search through vast databases containing emails, online chats and the browsing histories of millions of individuals. Britain's global surveillance program Tempora intercepts the fibre-optic cables that form the backbone of the Internet. Under the NSA's PRISM surveillance program, data that has already reached its final destination would be directly harvested from the servers of the following U.S. service providers: Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, Paltalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, and Apple Inc.\n\nThe NSA uses the analysis of phone call and e-mail logs of American citizens to create sophisticated graphs of their social connections that can identify their associates, their locations at certain times, their travelling companions and other personal information.\n\nAccording to top secret NSA documents leaked by Snowden, during a single day in 2012, the NSA collected e-mail address books from:\n\n\nEach day, the NSA collects contacts from an estimated 500,000 buddy lists on live-chat services as well as from the inbox displays of Web-based e-mail accounts. Taken together, the data enables the NSA to draw detailed maps of a person's life based on their personal, professional, religious and political connections.\n\nFederal agencies in the United States: Data gathered by these surveillance programs is routinely shared with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). In addition, the NSA supplies domestic intercepts to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and other law enforcement agencies.\n\nForeign countries: As a result of the NSA's secret treaties with foreign countries, data gathered by its surveillance programs are routinely shared with countries who are signatories to the UKUSA Agreement. These foreign countries also help to operate several NSA programs such as XKEYSCORE. (See International cooperation.)\n\nA special branch of the NSA called \"Follow the Money\" (FTM) monitors international payments, banking and credit card transactions and later stores the collected data in the NSA's financial databank, \"Tracfin\".\n\nMobile phone tracking refers to the act of attaining the position and coordinates of a mobile phone. According to \"The Washington Post\", the NSA has been tracking the locations of mobile phones from all over the world by tapping into the cables that connect mobile networks globally and that serve U.S. cellphones as well as foreign ones. In the process of doing so, the NSA collects more than 5 billion records of phone locations on a daily basis. This enables NSA analysts to map cellphone owners' relationships by correlating their patterns of movement over time with thousands or millions of other phone users who cross their paths.\n\nIn order to decode private conversations, the NSA has cracked the most commonly used cellphone encryption technology, A5/1. According to a classified document leaked by Snowden, the agency can \"process encrypted A5/1\" even when it has not acquired an encryption key. In addition, the NSA uses various types of cellphone infrastructure, such as the links between carrier networks, to determine the location of a cellphone user tracked by Visitor Location Registers.\n\nAs worldwide sales of smartphones grew rapidly, the NSA decided to take advantage of the smartphone boom. This is particularly advantageous because the smartphone contains a variety of data sets that would interest an intelligence agency, such as social contacts, user behaviour, interests, location, photos and credit card numbers and passwords.\n\nAccording to the documents leaked by Snowden, the NSA has set up task forces assigned to several smartphone manufacturers and operating systems, including Apple Inc.'s iPhone and iOS operating system, as well as Google's Android mobile operating system. Similarly, Britain's GCHQ assigned a team to study and crack the BlackBerry. In addition, there are smaller NSA programs, known as \"scripts\", that can perform surveillance on 38 different features of the iOS 3 and iOS 4 operating systems. These include the mapping feature, voicemail and photos, as well as Google Earth, Facebook and Yahoo! Messenger.\n\nIn contrast to the PRISM surveillance program, which is a front-door method of access that is nominally approved by the FISA court, the MUSCULAR surveillance program is noted to be \"unusually aggressive\" in its usage of unorthodox hacking methods to infiltrate Yahoo! and Google data centres around the world. As the program is operated overseas (United Kingdom), the NSA presumes that anyone using a foreign data link is a foreigner, and is, therefore, able to collect content and metadata on a previously unknown scale from U.S. citizens and residents. According to the documents leaked by Snowden, the MUSCULAR surveillance program is jointly operated by the NSA and Britain's GCHQ agency. (See International cooperation.)\n\nThe Five Eyes have made repeated attempts to spy on Internet users communicating in secret via the anonymity network Tor. Several of their clandestine operations involve the implantation of malicious code into the computers of anonymous Tor users who visit infected websites. In some cases, the NSA and GCHQ have succeeded in blocking access to the anonymous network, diverting Tor users to insecure channels. In other cases, the NSA and the GCHQ were able to uncover the identity of these anonymous users.\n\nUnder the Royal Concierge surveillance program, Britain's GCHQ agency uses an automated monitoring system to infiltrate the reservation systems of at least 350 luxury hotels in many different parts of the world. Other related surveillance programs involve the wiretapping of room telephones and fax machines used in targeted hotels, as well as the monitoring of computers, hooked up to the hotel network.\n\nThe U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have been conducting surveillance on the networks of many online games, including massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) such as World of Warcraft, as well as virtual worlds such as Second Life, and the Xbox gaming console.\n\nAccording to the April 2013 summary of disclosures, the NSA defined its \"intelligence priorities\" on a scale of \"1\" (highest interest) to \"5\" (lowest interest). It classified about 30 countries as \"3rd parties\", with whom it cooperates but also spies on:\n\n\nOther prominent targets included members and adherents of the Internet group known as \"Anonymous\", as well as potential whistleblowers. According to Snowden, the NSA targeted reporters who wrote critically about the government after 9/11.\n\nAs part of a joint operation with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the NSA deployed secret eavesdropping posts in eighty U.S. embassies and consulates worldwide. The headquarters of NATO were also used by NSA experts to spy on the European Union.\n\nIn 2013, documents provided by Edward Snowden revealed that the following intergovernmental organizations, diplomatic missions, and government ministries have been subjected to surveillance by the \"Five Eyes\":\n\nDuring World War II, the BRUSA Agreement was signed by the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom for the purpose of intelligence sharing. This was later formalized in the UKUSA Agreement of 1946 as a secret treaty. The full text of the agreement was released to the public on 25 June 2010.\n\nAlthough the treaty was later revised to include other countries such as Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Turkey, and the Philippines, most of the information sharing has been performed by the so-called \"Five Eyes\", a term referring to the following English-speaking western democracies and their respective intelligence agencies:\n\n\nLeft: SEA-ME-WE 3, which runs across the Afro-Eurasian supercontinent from Japan to Northern Germany, is one of the most important submarine cables accessed by the \"Five Eyes\". Singapore, a former British colony in the Asia-Pacific region (blue dot), plays a vital role in intercepting Internet and telecommunications traffic heading from Australia/Japan to Europe, and vice versa. An intelligence-sharing agreement between Singapore and Australia allows the rest of the \"Five Eyes\" to gain access to SEA-ME-WE 3.\n\nRight: TAT-14, a telecommunications cable linking Europe with the United States, was identified as one of few assets of \"Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources\" of the USA on foreign territory. In 2013, it was revealed that British officials \"pressured a handful of telecommunications and Internet companies\" to allow the British government to gain access to TAT-14.\nAccording to the leaked documents, aside from the Five Eyes, most other Western countries have also participated in the NSA surveillance system and are sharing information with each other. In the documents the NSA lists \"approved SIGINT partners\" which are partner countries in addition to the Five Eyes. Glenn Greenwald said that the \"NSA often maintains these partnerships by paying its partner to develop certain technologies and engage in surveillance, and can thus direct how the spying is carried out.\" These partner countries are divided into two groups, \"Second Parties\" and \"Third Parties\". The Second Parties are doing comprehensive cooperation with the NSA, and the Third Parties are doing focused cooperation. However, being a partner of the NSA does not automatically exempt a country from being targeted by the NSA itself. According to an internal NSA document leaked by Snowden, \"We (the NSA) can, and often do, target the signals of most 3rd party foreign partners.\"\n\nThe Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), formerly known as the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD), shares information on Australian citizens with the other members of the UKUSA Agreement. According to a 2008 Five Eyes document leaked by Snowden, data of Australian citizens shared with foreign countries include \"bulk, unselected, unminimised metadata\" as well as \"medical, legal or religious information\".\n\nIn close cooperation with other members of the Five Eyes community, the ASD runs secret surveillance facilities in many parts of Southeast Asia without the knowledge of Australian diplomats. In addition, the ASD cooperates with the Security and Intelligence Division (SID) of the Republic of Singapore in an international operation to intercept underwater telecommunications cables across the Eastern Hemisphere and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn March 2017 it was reported that, on advice from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, more than 500 Iraqi and Syrian refugees, have been refused entry to Australia, in the last year.\n\nThe Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) offers the NSA resources for advanced collection, processing, and analysis. It has set up covert sites at the request of NSA. The US-Canada SIGNT relationship dates back to a secret alliance formed during World War II, and was formalized in 1949 under the CANUSA Agreement.\n\nOn behalf of the NSA, the CSEC opened secret surveillance facilities in 20 countries around the world.\n\nAs well, the Communications Security Establishment Canada has been revealed, following the global surveillance disclosures to be engaging in surveillance on Wifi Hotspots of major Canadian Airports, collecting meta-data to use for engaging in surveillance on travelers, even days after their departure from said airports.\n\nThe Politiets Efterretningstjeneste (PET) of Denmark, a domestic intelligence agency, exchanges data with the NSA on a regular basis, as part of a secret agreement with the United States. Being one of the \"9-Eyes\" of the UKUSA Agreement, Denmark's relationship with the NSA is closer than the NSA's relationship with Germany, Sweden, Spain, Belgium or Italy.\n\nThe Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE) of France maintains a close relationship with both the NSA and the GCHQ after discussions for increased cooperation began in November 2006. By the early 2010s, the extent of cooperation in the joint interception of digital data by the DGSE and the NSA was noted to have increased dramatically.\n\nIn 2011, a formal memorandum for data exchange was signed by the DGSE and the NSA, which facilitated the transfer of millions of metadata records from the DGSE to the NSA. From December 2012 to 8 January 2013, over 70 million metadata records were handed over to the NSA by French intelligence agencies.\n\nThe Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) of Germany systematically transfers metadata from German intelligence sources to the NSA. In December 2012 alone, the BND provided the NSA with 500 million metadata records. The NSA granted the Bundesnachrichtendienst access to X-Keyscore, in exchange for the German surveillance programs Mira4 and Veras.\n\nIn early 2013, Hans-Georg Maaßen, President of the German domestic security agency Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV), made several visits to the headquarters of the NSA. According to classified documents of the German government, Maaßen agreed to transfer all data records of persons monitored in Germany by the BfV via XKeyscore to the NSA. In addition, the BfV works very closely with eight other U.S. government agencies, including the CIA. Under Project 6, which is jointly operated by the CIA, BfV, and BND, a massive database containing personal information such as photos, license plate numbers, Internet search histories and telephone metadata was developed to gain a better understanding of the social relationships of presumed jihadists.\n\nIn 2012, the BfV handed over 864 data sets of personal information to the CIA, NSA and seven other U.S. intelligence agencies. In exchange, the BND received data from U.S. intelligence agencies on 1,830 occasions. The newly acquired data was handed over to the BfV and stored in a domestically accessible system known as NADIS WN.\n\nThe Israeli SIGINT National Unit (ISNU) routinely receives raw, unfiltered data of U.S. citizens from the NSA. However, a secret NSA document leaked by Snowden revealed that U.S. government officials are explicitly exempted from such forms of data sharing with the ISNU. As stated in a memorandum detailing the rules of data sharing on U.S. citizens, the ISNU is obligated to:\n\nAccording to the undated memorandum, the ground rules for intelligence sharing between the NSA and the ISNU were laid out in March 2009. Under the data sharing agreement, the ISNU is allowed to retain the identities of U.S. citizens (excluding U.S. government officials) for up to a year.\n\nIn 2011, the NSA asked the Japanese government to intercept underwater fibre-optic cables carrying phone and Internet data in the Asia-Pacific region. However, the Japanese government refused to comply.\n\nUnder the reign of Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan regime forged a partnership with Britain's secret service MI6 and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to obtain information about Libyan dissidents living in the United States and Canada. In exchange, Gaddafi allowed the Western democracies to use Libya as a base for extraordinary renditions.\n\nThe Algemene Inlichtingen en Veiligheidsdienst (AIVD) of the Netherlands has been receiving and storing data of Internet users gathered by U.S. intelligence sources such as the NSA's PRISM surveillance program. During a meeting in February 2013, the AIVD and the MIVD briefed the NSA on their attempts to hack Internet forums and to collect the data of all users using a technology known as Computer Network Exploitation (CNE).\n\nThe Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS) has confirmed that data collected by the agency is \"shared with the Americans\". Kjell Grandhagen, head of Norwegian military intelligence told reporters at a news conference that \"We share this information with partners, and partners share with us ... We are talking about huge amounts of traffic data\".\n\nIn cooperation with the NSA, the NIS has gained access to Russian targets in the Kola Peninsula and other civilian targets. In general, the NIS provides information to the NSA about \"Politicians\", \"Energy\" and \"Armament\". A top secret memo of the NSA lists the following years as milestones of the Norway-United States of America SIGNT agreement, or NORUS Agreement:\n\n\nThe NSA perceives the NIS as one of its most reliable partners. Both agencies also cooperate to crack the encryption systems of mutual targets. According to the NSA, Norway has made no objections to its requests.\n\nThe Defence Ministry of Singapore and its Security and Intelligence Division (SID) have been secretly intercepting much of the fibre optic cable traffic passing through the Asian continent. In close cooperation with the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD/DSD), Singapore's SID has been able to intercept SEA-ME-WE 3 (Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 3) as well as SEA-ME-WE 4 telecommunications cables. Access to these international telecommunications channels is facilitated by Singapore's government-owned operator, SingTel. Temasek Holdings, a multibillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund with a majority stake in SingTel, has maintained close relations with the country's intelligence agencies.\n\nInformation gathered by the Government of Singapore is transferred to the Government of Australia as part of an intelligence sharing agreement. This allows the \"Five Eyes\" to maintain a \"stranglehold on communications across the Eastern Hemisphere\".\n\nIn close cooperation with the Centro Nacional de Inteligencia (CNI), the NSA intercepted 60.5 million phone calls in Spain in a single month.\n\nThe Försvarets radioanstalt (FRA) of Sweden (codenamed Sardines) has allowed the \"Five Eyes\" to access underwater cables in the Baltic Sea. On 5 December 2013, Sveriges Television (\"Swedish Television\") revealed that the FRA has been conducting a clandestine surveillance operation targeting the internal politics of Russia. The operation was conducted on behalf of the NSA, which receives data handed over to it by the FRA.\n\nAccording to documents leaked by Snowden, the FRA of Sweden has been granted access to the NSA's international surveillance program XKeyscore.\n\nThe Federal Intelligence Service (NDB) of Switzerland exchanges information with the NSA regularly, on the basis of a secret agreement to circumvent domestic surveillance restrictions. In addition, the NSA has been granted access to Swiss surveillance facilities in Leuk (canton of Valais) and Herrenschwanden (canton of Bern), which are part of the Swiss surveillance program Onyx.\n\nAccording to the NDB, the agency maintains working relationships with about 100 international organizations. However, the NDB has denied any form of cooperation with the NSA. Although the NSA does not have direct access to Switzerland's Onyx surveillance program, the Director of the NDB acknowledged that it is possible for other U.S. intelligence agencies to gain access to Switzerland's surveillance system.\n\nThe British government allowed the NSA to store personal data of British citizens.\n\nUnder Project MINARET, anti-Vietnam War dissidents in the United States were jointly targeted by the GCHQ and the NSA.\n\nThe CIA pays AT&T more than US$10 million a year to gain access to international phone records, including those of U.S. citizens.\n\nThe NSA's Foreign Affairs Directorate interacts with foreign intelligence services and members of the Five Eyes to implement global surveillance.\n\nThe FBI acts as the liaison between U.S. intelligence agencies and Silicon Valley giants such as Microsoft.\n\nIn the early 2010s, the DHS conducted a joint surveillance operation with the FBI to crack down on dissidents of the Occupy Wall Street protest movement.\n\nThe NSA supplies domestic intercepts to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and other law enforcement agencies, who use intercepted data to initiate criminal investigations against US citizens. Federal agents are instructed to \"recreate\" the investigative trail in order to \"cover up\" where the information originated.\n\nWeeks after the September 11 attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush signed the Patriot Act to ensure no disruption in the government's ability to conduct global surveillance:\n\nThe Patriot Act was extended by U.S. President Barack Obama in May 2011 to further extend the federal government's legal authority to conduct additional forms of surveillance such as roving wiretaps.\n\nOver 70 percent of the United States Intelligence Community's budget is earmarked for payment to private firms. According to \"Forbes\" magazine, the defense technology company Lockheed Martin is currently the USA's biggest defense contractor, and it is destined to be the NSA's most powerful commercial partner and biggest contractor in terms of dollar revenue.\n\nIn a joint operation with the NSA, the American telecommunications corporation AT&T operates Room 641A in the SBC Communications building in San Francisco to spy on Internet traffic. The CIA pays AT&T more than US$10 million a year to gain access to international phone records, including those of U.S. citizens.\n\nProjects developed by Booz Allen Hamilton include the Strategic Innovation Group to identify terrorists through social media, on behalf of government agencies. During the fiscal year of 2013, Booz Allen Hamilton derived 99% of its income from the government, with the largest portion of its revenue coming from the U.S. Army. In 2013, Booz Allen Hamilton was hailed by Bloomberg Businessweek as \"the World's Most Profitable Spy Organization\".\n\nBritish Telecommunications (code-named Remedy), a major supplier of telecommunications, granted Britain's intelligence agency GCHQ \"unlimited access\" to its network of undersea cables, according to documents leaked by Snowden.\n\nThe American multinational corporation Microsoft helped the NSA to circumvent software encryption safeguards. It also allowed the federal government to monitor web chats on the \"Outlook.com\" portal. In 2013, Microsoft worked with the FBI to allow the NSA to gain access to the company's cloud storage service SkyDrive.\n\nThe French telecommunications corporation Orange S.A. shares customer call data with the French intelligence agency DGSE, and the intercepted data is handed over to GCHQ.\n\nRSA Security was paid US$10 million by the NSA to introduce a cryptographic backdoor in its encryption products.\n\nStrategic Forecasting, Inc., more commonly known as Stratfor, is a global intelligence company offering information to governments and private clients including Dow Chemical Company, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, and the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nThe British telecommunications company Vodafone (code-named Gerontic) granted Britain's intelligence agency GCHQ \"unlimited access\" to its network of undersea cables, according to documents leaked by Snowden.\n\nIn-Q-Tel, which receives more than US$56 million a year in government support, is a venture capital firm that enables the CIA to invest in Silicon Valley.\n\nPalantir Technologies is a data mining corporation with close ties to the FBI, NSA and CIA.\n\nBased in Palo Alto, California, the company developed a data collection and analytical program known as Prism.\n\nIn 2011, it was revealed that the company conducted surveillance on Glenn Greenwald.\n\nSeveral countries have evaded global surveillance by constructing secret bunker facilities deep below the Earth's surface.\n\nDespite North Korea being a priority target, the NSA's internal documents acknowledged that it did not know much about Kim Jong Un and his regime's intentions.\n\nIn October 2012, Iran's police chief Esmail Ahmadi Moghaddam alleged that Google is not a search engine but \"a spying tool\" for Western intelligence agencies. Six months later in April 2013, the country announced plans to introduce an \"Islamic Google Earth\" to evade global surveillance.\n\nLibya evaded surveillance by building \"hardened and buried\" bunkers at least 40 feet below ground level.\n\nThe global surveillance disclosure has caused tension in the bilateral relations of the United States with several of its allies and economic partners as well as in its relationship with the European Union. On 12 August 2013, President Obama announced the creation of an \"independent\" panel of \"outside experts\" to review the NSA's surveillance programs. The panel is due to be established by the Director of National Intelligence, James R. Clapper, who will consult and provide assistance to them.\n\nAccording to a survey undertaken by the human rights group PEN International, these disclosures have had a chilling effect on American writers. Fearing the risk of being targeted by government surveillance, 28% of PEN's American members have curbed their usage of social media, and 16% have self-censored themselves by avoiding controversial topics in their writings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "162321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162321", "title": "Invariant mass", "text": "Invariant mass\n\nThe invariant mass, rest mass, intrinsic mass, proper mass, or in the case of bound systems simply mass, is the portion of the total mass of an object or system of objects that is independent of the overall motion of the system. More precisely, it is a characteristic of the system's total energy and momentum that is the same in all frames of reference related by Lorentz transformations. If a center of momentum frame exists for the system, then the invariant mass of a system is equal to its total mass in that \"rest frame\". In other reference frames, where the system's momentum is nonzero, the total mass (a.k.a. relativistic mass) of the system is greater than the invariant mass, but the invariant mass remains unchanged.\n\nDue to mass-energy equivalence, the rest energy of the system is simply the invariant mass times the speed of light squared. Similarly, the total energy of the system is its total (relativistic) mass times the speed of light squared.\n\nSystems whose four-momentum is a null vector (for example a single photon or many photons moving in exactly the same direction) have zero invariant mass, and are referred to as \"massless\". A physical object or particle moving faster than the speed of light would have space-like four-momenta (such as the hypothesized tachyon), and these do not appear to exist. Any time-like four-momentum possesses a reference frame where the momentum (3-dimensional) is zero, which is a center of momentum frame. In this case, invariant mass is positive and is referred to as the rest mass.\n\nIf objects within a system are in relative motion, then the invariant mass of the whole system will differ from the sum of the objects' rest masses. This is also equal to the total energy of the system divided by \"c\". See mass–energy equivalence for a discussion of definitions of mass. Since the mass of systems must be measured with a weight or mass scale in a center of momentum frame in which the entire system has zero momentum, such a scale always measures the system's invariant mass. For example, a scale would measure the kinetic energy of the molecules in a bottle of gas to be part of invariant mass of the bottle, and thus also its rest mass. The same is true for massless particles in such system, which add invariant mass and also rest mass to systems, according to their energy.\n\nFor an isolated \"massive\" system, the center of mass of the system moves in a straight line with a steady sub-luminal velocity (with a velocity depending on the reference frame used to view it). Thus, an observer can always be placed to move along with it. In this frame, which is the center of momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, and the system as a whole may be thought of as being \"at rest\" if it is a bound system (like a bottle of gas). In this frame, which exists under these assumptions, the invariant mass of the system is equal to the total system energy (in the zero-momentum frame) divided by . This total energy in the center of momentum frame, is the minimum energy which the system may be observed to have, when seen by various observers from various inertial frames.\n\nNote that for reasons above, such a rest frame does not exist for single photons, or rays of light moving in one direction. When two or more photons move in different directions, however, a center of mass frame (or \"rest frame\" if the system is bound) exists. Thus, the mass of a system of several photons moving in different directions is positive, which means that an invariant mass exists for this system even though it does not exist for each photon.\n\nBecause the invariant mass includes the mass of any kinetic and potential energies which remain in the center of momentum frame, the invariant mass of a system can be greater than sum of rest masses of its separate constituents. For example, rest mass and invariant mass are zero for individual photons even though they may add mass to the invariant mass of systems. For this reason, invariant mass is in general not an additive quantity (although there are a few rare situations where it may be, as is the case when massive particles in a system without potential or kinetic energy can be added to a total mass).\n\nConsider the simple case of two-body system, where object A is moving towards another object B which is initially at rest (in any particular frame of reference). The magnitude of invariant mass of this two-body system (see definition below) is different from the sum of rest mass (i.e. their respective mass when stationary). Even if we consider the same system from center-of-momentum frame, where net momentum is zero, the magnitude of the system's invariant mass is not equal to the sum of the rest masses of the particles within it.\n\nThe kinetic energy of such particles and the potential energy of the force fields increase the total energy above the sum of the particle rest masses, and both terms contribute to the invariant mass of the system. The sum of the particle kinetic energies as calculated by an observer is smallest in the center of momentum frame (again, called the \"rest frame\" if the system is bound).\n\nThey will often also interact through one or more of the fundamental forces, giving them a potential energy of interaction, possibly negative.\n\nFor an isolated \"massive\" system, the center of mass moves in a straight line with a steady sub-luminal velocity. Thus, an observer can always be placed to move along with it. In this frame, which is the center of momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, and the system as a whole may be thought of as being \"at rest\" if it is a bound system (like a bottle of gas). In this frame, which always exists, the invariant mass of the system is equal to the total system energy (in the zero-momentum frame) divided by .\n\nIn particle physics, the invariant mass is equal to the mass in the rest frame of the particle, and can be calculated by the particle's energy  and its momentum  as measured in \"any\" frame, by the energy–momentum relation:\n\nor in natural units where ,\n\nThis invariant mass is the same in all frames of reference (see also special relativity). This equation says that the invariant mass is the pseudo-Euclidean length of the four-vector , calculated using the relativistic version of the Pythagorean theorem which has a different sign for the space and time dimensions. This length is preserved under any Lorentz boost or rotation in four dimensions, just like the ordinary length of a vector is preserved under rotations. In quantum theory the invariant mass is a parameter in the relativistic Dirac equation for an elementary particle. The Dirac quantum operator corresponds to the particle four-momentum vector.\n\nSince the invariant mass is determined from quantities which are conserved during a decay, the invariant mass calculated using the energy and momentum of the decay products of a single particle is equal to the mass of the particle that decayed.\nThe mass of a system of particles can be calculated from the general formula:\n\nwhere\n\nThe term invariant mass is also used in inelastic scattering experiments. Given an inelastic reaction with total incoming energy larger than the total detected energy (i.e. not all outgoing particles are detected in the experiment), the invariant mass (also known as the \"missing mass\") of the reaction is defined as follows (in natural units):\n\nIf there is one dominant particle which was not detected during an experiment, a plot of the invariant mass will show a sharp peak at the mass of the missing particle.\n\nIn those cases when the momentum along one direction cannot be measured (i.e. in the case of a neutrino, whose presence is only inferred from the missing energy) the Transverse mass is used.\n\nIn a two-particle collision (or a two-particle decay) the square of the invariant mass (in natural units) is\n\nThe invariant mass of a system made of two massless particles whose momenta form an angle formula_8\nhas a convenient expression:\n\nIn particle collider experiments, one often defines the angular position of a particle in terms of an azimuthal angle formula_9 and pseudorapidity formula_10. Additionally the transverse momentum, formula_11, is usually measured. In this case if the particles are massless, or highly relativistic ( formula_12,) then the invariant mass becomes:\n\nThe rest energy formula_13 of a particle is defined as:\n\nwhere formula_15 is the speed of light in vacuum. In general, only differences in energy have physical significance.\n\nThe concept of rest energy follows from the special theory of relativity that leads to Einstein's famous conclusion about equivalence of energy and mass. See background for mass–energy equivalence.\n\nOn the other hand, the concept of the equivalent Dirac invariant rest mass may be defined in terms of the self energy corresponding to the product of a geometric matter current and a generalized potential as part of a single definition of mass in a geometric unified theory.\n\n\n"}

All of these mountains are located in the federal state of Bavaria. They lie within the Alps in the region known as the Eastern Alps and are part of the Northern Limestone Alps. The majority belong to the mountain ranges of the Wetterstein, Berchtesgaden Alps and Allgäu Alps.\n\nBecause the definition of a mountain is not universally agreed, a distinction is made between main summits and other peaks. Subsidiary summits or subpeaks are not counted. In the Alps a summit is classed as independent, according to the UIAA definition, if it has a prominence of 30 metres or more. In order for a peak to qualify as an independent mountain, however, it must have a prominence of at least 300 metres. Based on this definition only the main summits of entire mountain massifs are counted. All elevations with a prominence below 30 metres are considered as subpeaks.\n\nBy these definitions, the highest mountains in Germany are the Zugspitze (2,962 m), Hochwanner (2,746 m) and Watzmann (Middle Peak, 2,713 m). If all independent summits are counted, the Zugspitze is followed by the Schneefernerkopf (2,875 m) and the Middle Wetterspitze (2,747 m) in places two and three. Both are however, part of the Zugspitze massif and lie relatively close to the summit of the Zugspitze itself.\n\nThe highest mountain which lies entirely on German soil is the Watzmann with a height of 2,713 metres, followed by the Hochkalter (2,607 m), the Großer Daumen (2,280 m) and the Höfats (2,259 m). Likewise fully on German territory, but considerably less independent, are the Middle Höllentalspitze (2,742 m) and the Hochblassen (2,703 m).\n\nA majority of the summits were verifiably climbed in the 19th century; the Watzmann and Hoher Göll for example as early as 1800. The Zugspitze was officially climbed for the first time in 1820. However, there are many peaks of which it is suspected had been climbed in earlier times by unknown climbers.\n\nBecause the borders of Germany have often changed during the course of the centuries, there were different \"highest mountains\" in the past. For example, during the time of the Holy Roman Empire up to 1806, the Ortler in present-day South Tyrol, at 3,905 m, was the highest German mountain. During the colonial period to 1918 Mount Kilimanjaro in the colony of German East Africa, at 5,895 m, was officially the highest mountain of the German Reich. During the Nazi era from 1938 to 1945 this title went to the Großglockner which, at 3,797 m, is today the highest mountain in Austria.\n\n\nThere may be differences in data from other sources. The tables use the tables of the German height reference system, based on height above Normalnull (~sea level) in Amsterdam, and data from the Bavarian Survey Office (\"Bayerischen Vermessungsverwaltung\").\n\nTable 1 below shows the 30 highest independent summits in Germany. A summit or peak requires a prominence of over 30 metres in order to count as independent.\n\n\"By clicking on the symbols at the head of the table the individual columns may be sorted.\"\n\nTable 2 below shows the 21 highest mountains in Germany.

Cushion plants, grass-like plants and bryophytes are common. \n\nAt present there are outliers of Magellanic moorland as far north as in the highlands of Cordillera del Piuchén (latitude 42° 22' S) in Chiloé Island. During the Llanquihue glaciation Magellanic moorland extended to the non-glaciated lowlands of Chiloé Island and further north to the lowlands of Chilean lake district (latitude 41° S).\n\nThe classification of Magellanic moorland has proven problematic as substrate, low temperatures and exposure to the ocean influences the development of the Magallanic moorland.

{"id": "212124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=212124", "title": "Mie scattering", "text": "Mie scattering\n\nThe Mie solution to Maxwell's equations (also known as the Lorenz–Mie solution, the Lorenz–Mie–Debye solution or Mie scattering) describes the scattering of an electromagnetic plane wave by a homogeneous sphere. The solution takes the form of an infinite series of spherical multipole partial waves. It is named after Gustav Mie.\n\nThe term \"Mie solution\" is also used for solutions of Maxwell's equations for scattering by stratified spheres or by infinite cylinders, or other geometries where one can write separate equations for the radial and angular dependence of solutions. The term \"Mie theory\" is sometimes used for this collection of solutions and methods; it does not refer to an independent physical theory or law. More broadly, \"Mie scattering\" suggests situations where the size of the scattering particles is comparable to the wavelength of the light, rather than much smaller or much larger.\n\nMie scattering (sometimes referred to as a non-molecular or aerosol particle scattering) takes place in the lower 4.5 km of the atmosphere, where there may be many essentially spherical particles present with diameters approximately equal to the size of the wavelength of the incident energy. Mie scattering theory has no upper size limitation, and converges to the limit of geometric optics for large particles.\n\nA modern formulation of the Mie solution to the scattering problem on a sphere can be found in many books, e.g., J. A. Stratton's \"Electromagnetic Theory\". In this formulation, the incident plane wave, as well as the scattering field, is expanded into radiating spherical vector wave functions. The internal field is expanded into regular spherical vector wave functions. By enforcing the boundary condition on the spherical surface, the expansion coefficients of the scattered field can be computed.\n\nFor particles much larger or much smaller than the wavelength of the scattered light there are simple and excellent approximations that suffice to describe the behaviour of the system. But for objects whose size is similar to the wavelength, e.g., water droplets in the atmosphere, latex particles in paint, droplets in emulsions, including milk, and biological cells and cellular components, a more exact approach is necessary.\n\nThe Mie solution is named after its developer, German physicist Gustav Mie. Danish physicist Ludvig Lorenz and others independently developed the theory of electromagnetic plane wave scattering by a dielectric sphere.\n\nThe formalism allows the calculation of the electric and magnetic fields inside and outside a spherical object and is generally used to calculate either how much light is scattered, the total optical cross section, or where it goes, the form factor. The notable features of these results are the Mie resonances, sizes that scatter particularly strongly or weakly. This is in contrast to Rayleigh scattering for small particles and Rayleigh–Gans–Debye scattering (after Lord Rayleigh, Richard Gans and Peter Debye) for large particles. The existence of resonances and other features of Mie scattering make it a particularly useful formalism when using scattered light to measure particle size.\n\nMie solutions are implemented in a number of programs written in different computer languages such as Fortran, MATLAB, and Mathematica. These solutions are in terms of infinite series and include calculation of scattering phase function, extinction, scattering, and absorption efficiencies, and other parameters such as asymmetry parameter or radiation torque. Current usage of a \"Mie solution\" indicates a series approximation to a solution of Maxwell's equations. There are several known objects that allow such a solution: spheres, concentric spheres, infinite cylinders, cluster of spheres and cluster of cylinders. There are also known series solutions for scattering on ellipsoidal particles. For a list of these specialized codes, examine these articles:\n\nA generalization that allows a treatment of more generally shaped particles is the T-matrix method, which also relies on the series approximation to solutions of Maxwell's equations.\n\nRayleigh scattering describes the elastic scattering of light by spheres that are much smaller than the wavelength of light. The intensity \"I\" of the scattered radiation is given by\nwhere \"I\" is the light intensity before the interaction with the particle, \"R\" is the distance between the particle and the observer, \"θ\" is the scattering angle, \"n\" is the refractive index of the particle, and \"d\" is the diameter of the particle.\n\nIt can be seen from the above equation that Rayleigh scattering is strongly dependent upon the size of the particle and the wavelengths. The intensity of the Rayleigh scattered radiation increases rapidly as the ratio of particle size to wavelength increases. Furthermore, the intensity of Rayleigh scattered radiation is identical in the forward and reverse directions.\n\nThe Rayleigh scattering model breaks down when the particle size becomes larger than around 10% of the wavelength of the incident radiation. In the case of particles with dimensions greater than this, Mie's scattering model can be used to find the intensity of the scattered radiation. The intensity of Mie scattered radiation is given by the summation of an infinite series of terms rather than by a simple mathematical expression. It can be shown, however, that scattering in this range of particle sizes differs from Rayleigh scattering in several respects: it is roughly independent of wavelength and it is larger in the forward direction than in the reverse direction. The greater the particle size, the more of the light is scattered in the forward direction.\n\nThe blue colour of the sky results from Rayleigh scattering, as the size of the gas particles in the atmosphere is much smaller than the wavelength of visible light. Rayleigh scattering is much greater for blue light than for other colours due to its shorter wavelength. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, its blue component is Rayleigh scattered strongly by atmospheric gases but the longer wavelength (e.g. red/yellow) components are not. The sunlight arriving directly from the Sun therefore appears to be slightly yellow, while the light scattered through rest of the sky appears blue. During sunrises and sunsets, the effect of Rayleigh scattering on the spectrum of the transmitted light is much greater due to the greater distance the light rays have to travel through the high-density air near the Earth's surface.\n\nIn contrast, the water droplets that make up clouds are of a comparable size to the wavelengths in visible light, and the scattering is described by Mie's model rather than that of Rayleigh. Here, all wavelengths of visible light are scattered approximately identically, and the clouds therefore appear to be white or grey.\n\nThe Rayleigh–Gans approximation is an approximate solution to light scattering when the relative refractive index of the particle is close to unity, and its size is much smaller in comparison to the wavelength of light divided by |\"n\" − 1|, where \"n\" is the refractive index.\n\nThe anomalous diffraction approximation is valid for large (compared to wavelength) and optically soft spheres.\n(soft in the context of optics implies that the refractive index of the particle (m) differs only slightly\nfrom the refractive index of the environment, in comparison with scattering of acoustic waves, and the particle subjects\nthe wave to only a small phase shift.) The extinction efficiency in this approximation is given by\nwhere \"Q\" is the efficiency factor of scattering, which is defined as the ratio of the scattering cross-section and geometrical cross-section π\"a\".\n\nThe term \"p\" = 4πa(\"n\" − 1)/λ has as its physical meaning the phase delay of the wave passing through the centre of the sphere, where \"a\" is the sphere radius, \"n\" is the ratio of refractive indices inside and outside of the sphere, and \"λ\" the wavelength of the light.\n\nThis set of equations was first described by van de Hulst in (1957).\n\nMie theory is very important in meteorological optics, where diameter-to-wavelength ratios of the order of unity and larger are characteristic for many problems regarding haze and cloud scattering. A further application is in the characterization of particles by optical scattering measurements. The Mie solution is also important for understanding the appearance of common materials like milk, biological tissue and latex paint.\n\nMie scattering occurs when the diameters of atmospheric particulates are similar to the wavelengths of the scattered light. Dust, pollen, smoke and microscopic water droplets that form clouds are common causes of Mie scattering. Mie scattering occurs mostly in the lower portions of the atmosphere, where larger particles are more abundant, and dominates in cloudy conditions.\n\nMie theory has been used to determine whether scattered light from tissue corresponds to healthy or cancerous cell nuclei using angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry.\n\nA number of unusual electromagnetic scattering effects occur for magnetic spheres. When the relative permittivity equals the permeability, the back-scatter gain is zero. Also, the scattered radiation is polarized in the same sense as the incident radiation. In the small-particle (or long-wavelength) limit, conditions can occur for zero forward scatter, for complete polarization of scattered radiation in other directions, and for asymmetry of forward scatter to backscatter. The special case in the small-particle limit provides interesting special instances of complete polarization and forward-scatter-to-backscatter asymmetry.\n\nMie theory has been used to design metamaterials. They usually consist of three-dimensional composites of metal or non-metallic inclusions periodically or randomly embedded in a low-permittivity matrix. In such a scheme, the negative constitutive parameters are designed to appear around the Mie resonances of the inclusions: the negative effective permittivity is designed around the resonance of the Mie electric dipole scattering coefficient, whereas negative effective permeability is designed around the resonance of the Mie magnetic dipole scattering coefficient, and doubly negative material (DNG) is designed around the overlap of resonances of Mie electric and magnetic dipole scattering coefficients. The particle usually have the following combinations:\n\nIn theory, the particles analyzed by Mie theory are commonly spherical but, in practice, particles are usually fabricated as cubes or cylinders for ease of fabrication. To meet the criteria of homogenization, which may be stated in the form that the lattice constant is much smaller than the operating wavelength, the relative permittivity of the dielectric particles should be much greater than 1, e.g. formula_3 to achieve negative effective permittivity (permeability).\n\nMie theory is often applied in laser diffraction analysis to inspect the particle sizing effect. While early computers in the 1970s were only able to compute diffraction data with the more simple Fraunhofer approximation, Mie is widely used since the 1990s and officially recommended for particles below 50 micrometers in guideline ISO 13321:2009.\n\nMie theory has been used in the detection of oil concentration in polluted water.\n\nMie scattering is the primary method of sizing single sonoluminescing bubbles of air in water and is valid for cavities in materials, as well as particles in materials, as long as the surrounding material is essentially non-absorbing.\n\nIt has also been used to study the structure of \"Plasmodium falciparum\", a particularly pathogenic form of malaria.\n\nIn 1986 P. A. Bobbert and J. Vlieger extended the Mie model to calculate scattering by a sphere in a homogeneous medium placed on flat surface. Like Mie model, the extended model can be applied to spheres with a radius close to the wavelength of the incident light. There is a C++ code implementing Bobbert–Vlieger (BV) model.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1404433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1404433", "title": "Mud volcano", "text": "Mud volcano\n\nA mud volcano or mud dome is a landform created by the eruption of mud or slurries, water and gases. Several geological processes may cause the formation of mud volcanoes. Mud volcanoes are not true igneous volcanoes as they do not produce lava and are not necessarily driven by magmatic activity. The Earth continuously exudes a mud-like substance, which may sometimes be referred to as a \"mud volcano\". Mud volcanoes may range in size from merely 1 or 2 meters high and 1 or 2 meters wide, to 700 meters high and 10 kilometers wide. Smaller mud exudations are sometimes referred to as mud-pots. \n\nThe mud produced by mud volcanoes is mostly formed as hot water, which has been heated deep below the Earth's surface, begins to mix and blend with subterranean mineral deposits, thus creating the mud slurry exudate. This material is then forced upwards through a geological fault or fissure due to local subterranean pressure imbalances. Mud volcanoes are associated with subduction zones and about 1100 have been identified on or near land. The temperature of any given active mud volcano generally remains fairly steady and is much lower than the typical temperatures found in igneous volcanoes. Mud volcano temperatures can range from near to occasionally , some being used as popular \"mud baths.\"\n\nAbout 86% of the gas released from these structures is methane, with much less carbon dioxide and nitrogen emitted. Ejected materials are most often a slurry of fine solids suspended in water that may contain a mixture of salts, acids and various hydrocarbons.\n\nPossible mud volcanoes have been identified on Mars.\n\nA mud volcano may be the result of a piercement structure created by a pressurized mud diapir that breaches the Earth's surface or ocean bottom. Their temperatures may be as low as the freezing point of the ejected materials, particularly when venting is associated with the creation of hydrocarbon clathrate hydrate deposits. Mud volcanoes are often associated with petroleum deposits and tectonic subduction zones and orogenic belts; hydrocarbon gases are often erupted. They are also often associated with lava volcanoes; in the case of such close proximity, mud volcanoes emit incombustible gases including helium, whereas lone mud volcanoes are more likely to emit methane.\n\nApproximately 1,100 mud volcanoes have been identified on land and in shallow water. It has been estimated that well over 10,000 may exist on continental slopes and abyssal plains.\n\n\nMost liquid and solid material is released during eruptions, but seeps occur during dormant periods.\n\nThe mud is rich in halite (rock salt).\n\nFirst-order estimates of mud volcano emissions have been made (1 Tg = 1 million metric tonnes).\n\nDozens of mud volcanoes can be found on the Taman Peninsula of Russia and the Kerch Peninsula of Crimea along with the south-western portion of Bulgaria near Rupite. In Italy, they are common in the northern front of the Apennines and in Sicily. On August 24, 2013, a mud volcano appeared in the centre of the via Coccia di Morto roundabout in Fiumicino near Rome.\n\nMud volcanoes can be found in the Berca Mud Volcanoes near Berca in Buzău County, Romania, close to the Carpathian Mountains.\n\nMud volcanism is a common phenomena in Indonesia with dozens of structures present onshore and offshore . \n\nThe Indonesian Lusi mud eruption is often (and wrongly) described as a mud volcano. Geochemical, pertrography and geophysical results reveal instead that Lusi is a sediment-hosted hydrothermal system connected at depth with the neighboring Arjuno Welirang volcanic complex . \n\nDrilling or an earthquake in the Porong subdistrict of East Java province, Indonesia, may have resulted in the Sidoarjo mud flow on May 29, 2006. The mud covered about 440 hectares, (2.73 mi), and inundated four villages, homes, roads, rice fields, and factories, displacing about 24,000 people and killing 14. The gas exploration company involved was operated by PT Lapindo Brantas and the earthquake that may have triggered the mud volcano was the 6.3 magnitude Yogyakarta earthquake of May 27, 2006. According to geologists who have been monitoring Lusi and the surrounding area, the system is beginning to show signs of catastrophic collapse. It was forecasted that the region could sag the vent and surrounding area by up to in the next decade. In March 2008, the scientists observed drops of up to in one night. Most of the subsidence in the area around the volcano is more gradual, at around per day. A study by a group of Indonesian geo-scientists led by Bambang Istadi predicted the area affected by the mudflow over a ten-year period. More recent studies carried out in 2011 predict that the mud will flow for another 20 years, or even longer. Now named Lusi – a contraction of \"Lumpur Sidoarjo\", where \"lumpur\" is the Indonesian word for \"mud\" – the eruption represent an active hybrid system.\n\nIn the Suoh caldera in Lampung, dozens of mud cones and mudpots varying in temperature are found.\n\nMany mud volcanoes exist on the shores of the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Tectonic forces and large sedimentary deposits around the latter have created several fields of mud volcanoes, many of them emitting methane and other hydrocarbons. Features over high occur in Azerbaijan, with large eruptions sometimes producing flames of similar scale. There are mud volcanoes in Georgia, such as at Akhtala.\n\nIran and Pakistan possess mud volcanoes in the Makran range of mountains in the south of the two countries. A large mud volcano is located in Balochistan, Pakistan. It is known as \"Baba Chandrakup\" (literally Father Moonwell) on the way to Hinglaj and is a Hindu pilgrim site.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many mud volcanoes in Iran: in Hormozgan province, Sistan and Baluchestan Province where Pirgel is located, and Golestan Province.\nBaratang island, part of the Great Andaman archipelago in the Andaman Islands, Indian Ocean, has several sites of mud volcanic activity. \nIn Pakistan there are more than 80 active mud volcanoes in Balochistan province; there are about 10 locations with clusters of mud volcanoes. In the west, in Gwadar District, the mud volcanoes are very small and mostly sit in the south of Jabal-e-Mehdi toward Sur Bandar. Many more are in the northeast of Ormara. The remainder are in Lasbela District and are scattered between south of Gorangatti on Koh Hinglaj to Koh Kuk in the North of Miani Hor in the Hangol Valley. In this region, the heights of mud volcanoes range between . The most famous is Chandragup. The biggest crater found at 25°33'13.63\"N. 65°44'09.66\"E is about in diameter. Most mud volcanoes in this region are in out-of-reach areas having very difficult terrain. Dormant mud volcanoes stand like columns of mud in many other areas.\n\nIn the Turtle Islands, in the province of Tawi-Tawi, the southwestern edge of the Philippines bordering Malaysia, presence of mud volcanoes are evident on three of the islands – Lihiman, Great Bakkungan and Boan Islands. The northeastern part of Lihiman Island is distinguished for having a more violent kind of mud extrusions mixed with large pieces of rocks, creating a 20-m (66-ft) wide crater on that hilly part of the island. Such extrusions are reported to be accompanied by mild earthquakes and evidence of extruded materials can be found high in the surrounding trees. Submarine mud extrusions off the island have been observed by local residents.\n\n\nMud volcanoes of the North American continent include:\n\nThe name of Yellowstone National Park's \"Mud Volcano\" feature and the surrounding area is misleading; it consists of hot springs, mud pots and fumaroles, rather than a true mud volcano. Depending upon the precise definition of the term \"mud volcano\", the Yellowstone formation could be considered a hydrothermal mud volcano cluster. The feature is much less active than in its first recorded description, although the area is quite dynamic. Yellowstone is an active geothermal area with a magma chamber near the surface, and active gases are chiefly steam, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide. \n\nHowever, there are mud volcanoes and mud geysers elsewhere in Yellowstone. One, the \"Vertically Gifted Cyclic Mud Pot\" sometimes acts as a geyser, throwing mud up to 30 feet high.\n\nThe mud volcano in Yellowstone was previously a mound until suddenly it tore itself apart into the formation seen today.\n\n\n\nThe eastern part of Venezuela contains several mud volcanoes (or mud domes), all of them having an origin related to oil deposits. The mud of from Maturín, Venezuela, contains water, biogenic gas, hydrocarbons and an important quantity of salt. Cattle from the savanna often gather around to lick the dried mud for its salt content.\n\nVolcan El Totumo, which marks the division between Bolívar and Atlantico in Colombia. This volcano is approximately high and can accommodate 10 to 15 people in its crater; many tourists and locals visit this volcano due to the alleged medicinal benefits of the mud; it is next to a \"cienaga\", or lake. This volcano is under legal dispute between the Bolívar and Atlántico Departamentos because of its tourist value.\n\n\n"}

P. Dutton in 1959. It features a boy who learns about courage, independence, and the need for companionship while attempting to live in a forested area of New York state. In 1960, it was one of three Newbery Medal Honor Books (runners-up) and in 1969 it was loosely adapted as a film of the same name. George continued the story in print, decades later.\n\nThe place is New York City. It is the 1950s. The protagonist is 14 year old Sam Gribley. With eight brothers and sisters, the New York apartment is crowded. Sam runs away to his great-grandfather's abandoned farm, to live off the land. \n\nHe studies survival skills from books at the New York City Public Library. A bus takes him to the small town of Delhi, NY. Sam's father permits him to go to Delhi, if Sam will let people in town know he is staying at the farm. Sam builds a shelter from hemlock branches. He catches trout. He cannot make fire. \n\nSam fails to locate his grandfather's farm. He meets Bill, who lives in a cabin. Bill teaches him how to make fire. Sam finds the farm. A stone foundation is its only remains.\n\nSelf-sufficient, Sam forages and traps plants and animals. He makes a hollow tree his home. As Native Americans used fire to create dugout canoes, Sam uses fire to enlarge the interior of the hollow tree. \n\nA peregrine falcon is hunting for prey. Sam wants a hunting falcon to harvest game. Sam studies falconry at the town's library. He camps for days to seek out the falcon's eyrie. He steals an eyas, naming it Frightful. \n\nSam is forced to hide. A forest ranger is investigating one of Sam's fires. The ranger lingers overnight. One of Sam's traps catches a weasel instead of game. Sam adopts it, and calls the weasel The Baron.\n\nWinter is coming. Sam kills a deer for its Buckskin (leather). He smokes venison.\n\nSam trains Frightful to hunt. Sam hunts frogs, pheasants, rabbits, and sparrows. He preserves wild grains and tubers, smokes fish and meat. He makes storage spaces in trunks of other trees.\n\nSam makes buckskins to wear. Sam notices a raccoon digging for mussels in the creek. Sam names the raccoon Jesse Coon James. \n\nSam returns to his hollowed out tree home. He finds a man there. The man is a professor of English literature. Sam nicknames him Bando, while Bando gives Sam the nickname \"Thoreau\". He spends 10 days with Sam. They build a raft and catch fish. He teaches Sam to make a whistle from a willow branch. Bando leaves, but will come back for Christmas.\n\nSam makes a clay fireplace to keep his home warm. Sam insulates the treehouse too well, however: fire generates carbon monoxide. Sam makes holes which ventilate the cabin for fresh air. \n\nOn Christmas Eve, Bando is back. On Christmas Day, Sam's father has come to visit. Sam is overjoyed to see his father. The three have Christmas dinner of venison. Sam's father is relieved. Sam is doing just fine.\n\nSpring arrives. Matt Spell, a teenager who aspires to be a reporter for the newspaper, arrives at Sam's treehouse. Matt wants to write about Sam's presence on the Gribley farm. Sam offers Matt a deal: Matt can visit for a week during spring, if Matt keeps everything secret. Matt agrees. \n\nSam encounters Aaron, a Jewish songwriter visiting the forest for inspiration and sings him a song. He tells Sam it is close to Passover. \n\nMatt spends the week with Sam. Matt is thrilled to be there, but Sam is sad. It reminds him too much of life in New York City.\n\nBando returns to check on Sam. Sam asks Bando for some jeans and a shirt. In June, Sam's father, mother, and all his siblings arrive. Father announces the entire family is moving to the farm. Sam is overjoyed the family has come. He is also upset. It is the end of independence, living off the land. \n\nSam argues with his father. He is building a proper house for the family on the land. Sam is upset about the traditional home. It means abandoning the treehouse. Mother states he can go off on his own at age 18.\n\n\n\"My Side of the Mountain\" won critical plaudits upon its release. Numerous reviewers praised the novel for its detailed depiction of the wilderness and animals, its unsentimental treatment of animals and nature, and its characters, their maturation, and development. The \"New York Times\" in 1959 gave the novel a solid review, calling it \"a delightful flight from civilization, written with real feeling for the woods.\" Children's author Zena Sutherland, writing in \"Children & Books\" at the time, called Sam's development from immature, impulsive child into a mature young adult \"wholly convincing\". Ruth Hill Viguers, reviewing the book in \"The Horn Book Magazine\", concluded in 1959, \"I believe it will be read year after year, linking together many generations in a chain of well-remembered joy and refreshment.\"\n\nIn addition to being named to the Newbery Award Honors list, the book was also an American Library Association's Notable Book for 1959, was placed on the Hans Christian Andersen Award 1959 honors list, was given a Lewis Carroll Shelf Award citation (in 1965), and won the 1959 George G. Stone Center for Children's Books Award.\n\nThe book continued to be praised in the 1990s and 2000s. Book critic Eden Ross Lipson included it in her 2000 list of the best children's books, and said it \"skillfully blends themes of nature, courage, curiosity, and independence\". Librarians and authors Janice DeLong and Rachel Schwedt listed the book as one of a \"core collection for small libraries\" of the contemporary fiction section. Author Charles Wohlforth, writing in 2004, agreed that it was a classic of contemporary children's literature. By 1998, the book had been translated into numerous foreign languages, and visitors to the Cannon Free Library in Delhi, New York, often asked to see the abandoned farm where the novel was set. (The abandoned farm does not actually exist; the Gribley farm is entirely fictional.)\n\nThe book has not always won uncritical praise. In 1999, reviewer Mary Harris Russell noted that \"the narrator, Sam, speaks with a tone more measured than that of most teenagers. That tone grates on some readers.\"\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has cited \"My Side of the Mountain\" with inspiring him to become a falconer, which led him into a career in environmental law and environmental activism. Television host and pet advice author Marc Morrone and award-winning natural history author Ken Lamberton also credit the book with generating their interest in falconry.\n\nBased on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association named the book one of its \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\". In 2012 it was ranked number 77 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by \"School Library Journal\".\n\nA film adaptation directed by James B. Clark was released by Paramount Pictures in 1969. The film \"My Side of the Mountain\" is set in Toronto and the Notre Dame Mountains, a Quebec province section of the Appalachians, rather than in New York City and a New York state section.\n\nA sequel written and illustrated by George was published in 1990, more than three decades after the original. Over the next 16 years there were three more sequels, a third novel illustrated by George and two picture books illustrated by Daniel San Souci. All the sequels were published by Dutton Children's Books, an imprint of Penguin Books since its acquisition of the original publisher E. P. Dutton in 1986.\n\n\nThe three novels were issued in an omnibus edition that retains the original pagination, about 600 pages in sum: \"My Side of the Mountain Trilogy\" (2000). \n\nIn 2009, Dutton published \"A Pocket Guide to the Outdoors: Based on 'My Side of the Mountain\"', by George and her daughter Twig C. George. According to a library summary: \"This guide to the outdoors provides advice and instructions on camping, building shelters, finding water, and cooking outdoors. Some activities may require adult supervision.\" Inside responsibility credits John C. George and T. Luke George as well. \n"}
{"id": "555791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=555791", "title": "Nicobar Islands", "text": "Nicobar Islands\n\nThe Nicobar Islands are an archipelagic island chain in the eastern Indian Ocean. They are located in Southeast Asia, 150 km north of Aceh on Sumatra, and separated from Thailand to the east by the Andaman Sea. Located 1,300 km southeast of the Indian subcontinent, across the Bay of Bengal, they form part of the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India.\n\nUNESCO has declared the Great Nicobar Island as one of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves.\n\nThe Nicobar Islands cover a land area of 1,841 km and had a population of 36,844 during the 2011 Census. They comprise three distinct groups:\n\nNorthern Group:\n\nCentral Group:\n\nSouthern Group (Sambelong):\n\nIndira Point () is the southernmost point of Great Nicobar Island and also of India itself, lying about 150 km north of Sumatra, Indonesia.\n\nThe Nicobar Islands are part of a great island arc created by the collision of the Indo-Australian Plate with Eurasia. The collision lifted the Himalayas and most of the Indonesian islands, and created a long arc of highlands and islands, which includes the Arakan Yoma range of Burma, the Andaman and Nicobar islands, and the islands off the west coast of Sumatra, including the Banyak Islands and Mentawai Islands.\n\nThe climate is warm and tropical, with temperatures ranging from 22 to 30 °C. Rainfall is heavy due to annual monsoons and measures around 3000 to 3800 mm each year. The vegetation of the Nicobars is typically divided into the coastal mangrove forests and the interior evergreen and deciduous Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests. Additionally, several islands contain extensive inland grasslands, though these are thought to result from human intervention.\n\nThe Nicobar Islands are recognised as a distinct terrestrial ecoregion, the Nicobar Islands rain forests, with many endemic species.\n\nAs a result of lower sea levels during the ice ages, the Andaman Islands were linked to the Southeast Asian mainland, but it is not believed that the Nicobar Islands ever had a land bridge to the continent. Lower sea levels did link the islands to one another: Great Nicobar and Little Nicobar were linked to each other, and Nancowry, Chaura, Katchall, Trinka, Camorta, and the nearby smaller islands were linked to one another as well.\n\nThe Nicobar Islands are believed to have been inhabited for thousands of years. Six indigenous Nicobarese languages are spoken on the islands, which are part of the Mon–Khmer branch of the Austroasiatic language family, which includes Mon, Khmer and Vietnamese languages of Southeast Asia, and the Munda languages of India. An indigenous tribe living at the southern tip of Great Nicobar, called the Shompen, may be of Mesolithic Southeast Asian origin.\n\nThe earliest extant references to the name \"Nicobar\" is in the Sri Lankan Pali Buddhist chronicles, the \"Dipavamsa\" (c. 3rd or 4th century CE) and the \"Mahavamsa\" (c. 4th or 5th century), which state that the children of the followers of the legendary founder of the Sri Lankan Kingdom, Vijaya, landed on \"Naggadipa\" (the island of the children, from the Pali nagga meaning 'naked'). The modern name is likely derived from the Chola dynasty name for the islands, Nakkavaram or 'Puup Pii' (literally, \"naked man\" in Tamil) which is inscribed on the Thanjavur (Tanjore) inscription of 1050 CE. Marco Polo (12th-13th century) also referred to this island as 'Necuverann'.\n\nThe history of organised European colonisation on the islands began with the Danish East India Company in 1754/56. During this time they were administrated from Tranquebar (in continental Danish India) administrated under the name of Frederiksøerne; missionaries from the Moravian Church Brethren's settlement in Tranquebar attempted a settlement on Nancowry and died in great numbers from disease; the islands were repeatedly abandoned due to outbreaks of malaria: 1784–1807/09, 1830–1834 and finally from 1848 gradually for good. Between 1778 and 1783, William Bolts attempted to establish an Austrian colony on the islands on the mistaken assumption that Denmark–Norway had abandoned its claims to the islands.\n\nItaly made an attempt at buying the Nicobar Islands from Denmark between 1864 and 1868. The Italian Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Luigi Torelli started a negotiation that looked promising, but failed due to the unexpected end of his Office and the . The negotiations were interrupted and never brought up again.\n\nDenmark's presence in the islands ended formally on 16 October 1868 when it sold the rights to the Nicobar Islands to Britain, which in 1869 made them part of British India.\n\nDuring World War II, the islands were occupied by Japan between 1942 and 1945. India occupied these islands after the Surrender of Japan, as its Territory.\n\nTogether with the Andaman Islands, they became a union territory of India in 1950.\n\nAndaman and Nicobar islands are also known for the various types of water sports available. Water sports include snorkeling, scuba diving, parasailing, under-sea walking and other thrilling sports. Water sports is one main cause of the huge tourist attraction to this place. People can enjoy with their families and prefer to relax or excite themselves.\n\nOn 26 December 2004, the coast of the Nicobar Islands was devastated by a 10–15 m high tsunami following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. At least 6,000 people were killed on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands with reports putting the death toll on Katchal Island alone at 4,600.\n\nSeveral islands were heavily damaged with initial reports of islands broken in two or three pieces and coral reefs moved above water. Teressa Island was said to have been split into two pieces and Trinkat Island into three pieces. Some estimates said that the islands were moved as much as 100 feet (30 m) by the earthquake and tilted.\n\nIndira Point subsided 4.25 m and the lighthouse there was damaged.\n\nOn 31 May 2013 it was reported that Nicobar Islands have been declared as World Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3235897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3235897", "title": "North Pacific Gyre", "text": "North Pacific Gyre\n\nThe North Pacific Gyre (NPG) or North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), located in the northern Pacific Ocean, is one of the five major oceanic gyres. This gyre covers most of the northern Pacific Ocean. It is the largest ecosystem on Earth, located between the equator and 50° N latitude, and comprising 20 million square kilometers.\nThe gyre has a clockwise circular pattern and is formed by four prevailing ocean currents: the North Pacific Current to the north, the California Current to the east, the North Equatorial Current to the south, and the Kuroshio Current to the west. It is the site of an unusually intense collection of man-made marine debris, known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\n\nThe North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and the much smaller North Pacific Subpolar Gyre make up the two major gyre systems in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Pacific Ocean. This two-gyre circulation in the North Pacific is driven by the trade and westerly winds. This is one of the best examples of all of Earth’s oceans where these winds drive a two-gyre circulation. Physical characteristics like weak thermohaline circulation in the North Pacific and it is mostly blocked by land in the north, also help facilitate this circulation. As depth increases, these gyres in the North Pacific grow smaller and weaker, and the high pressure at the center of the Subtropical Gyre will migrate poleward and westward.\n\nLike all subtropical gyre systems, the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is an anticyclone meaning the circulation is in a clockwise direction around its high pressure at the center because of its placement in the Northern Hemisphere. This circulation is also associated with equatorward Sverdrup transport and Ekman downwelling. Ekman transport causes water to flow toward the center of the gyre, creating a sloped sea-surface, and initiating geostrophic flow. Harald Sverdrup applied Ekman transport while including pressure gradient forces to develop a theory for Sverdrup transport.\n\nThe Kuroshio Current is the narrow, strong westward boundary current of the subtropical circulation. This current influences the water column all the way to the bottom. The Kuroshio current flows in a northerly direction, then eventually flows further from the westward boundary where it then takes an eastward direction into the North Pacific. This eastward flowing current is then called the Kuroshio Extension. The North Pacific Current is located just north of the Subtropical Gyre and flows in an easterly direction. Also, known as the West Wind Drift or the Subarctic Current, the North Pacific Current also includes the westward flow of the southern boundary of the North Pacific Subpolar Gyre. The North Equatorial Current borders the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre on the south and flows in a westerly direction. The westward flow within the elongated tropical cyclonic circulation is also included in the North Equatorial current. The California Current System comprises the eastern boundary of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and flows south along the coast of California. Here coastal upwelling drives the eastern boundary current and an undercurrent that flows poleward.\n\nIn the western region of the North Pacific, the surface of the Subtropical Gyre generally has a \"C-shape\". The Kuroshio current and Kuroshio Extension roughly from the outside of this \"C-shape\" where it then turns westwards into recirculation, where it then flows south parallel to the Kuroshio Current. From here the \"C-shape\" then flows eastward comprising the Subtropical Countercurrent at roughly 20 – 25⁰N, then finally the \"C\" wraps back towards the west forming the North Equatorial Current just south of 20⁰N. It is common for subtropical gyres to have this \"C-shape\" surface flow. The Subtropical Countercurrent is a shallow area of this \"C\"; at only about 250 dbar under the surface, circulation is a simpler closed, anticyclonic gyre.\n\nNarrow east-west frontal zones that cross the Pacific are less than 100  km wide. The Subarctic Frontal Zone or Subarctic Boundary, about 42⁰N, is fixed in the North Pacific Current. The Subarctic Frontal Zone, slightly south of the maximum westerly wind speeds, separates the North Pacific Subpolar Gyre from the Subtropical Gyre. In the central and eastern Pacific at roughly 32⁰N is the Subtropical Frontal Zone. Sometimes referred to as the Subtropical Convergence Zone, this frontal zone serves as the boundary between the west flowing North Equatorial Current from the North Pacific Current. With increasing depth in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, it gets smaller in the western region near Japan and it also loses strength. The Subtropical Gyre does not exist below 1500 m below the surface with the exception of the Kuroshio Current and Extension regions.\n\nThe North Pacific Subtropical Gyre diminishes spatially with increasing depth. Similar to all subtropical gyre systems, the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre shrinks towards its most energetic surface flows, in a northwestern direction between the Kuroshio Current and the Kuroshio Extension. This is drastic shrinkage from the surface to about 200 m below. At the surface, the boundary that separates the westward and eastward flows from south of 20⁰N to about 25 – 30⁰N at 200 m. The \"C-shape\" in the western region of the Subtropical Gyre, including the Subtropical Countercurrent, generally does not exist below 200 m. At about 1000 – 1500 m, the Subtropical Gyre is located entirely in the western region of the North Pacific near the Kuroshio Current and Kuroshio Extension. In the subtropical regions, flow is weak where influences from the Subtropical Gyre are minimal. Differences in steric heights over distances of 1000  km are on the order of 1  cm, rather than the differences of 10  cm within the area of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41227473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41227473", "title": "Origins of global surveillance", "text": "Origins of global surveillance\n\nThe origins of global surveillance can be traced back to the late 1940s, when the UKUSA Agreement was jointly enacted by the United Kingdom and the United States, whose close cooperation eventually culminated in the creation of the global surveillance network, code-named \"ECHELON\", in 1971.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1970s Watergate affair and a subsequent congressional inquiry led by Sen. Frank Church, it was revealed that the NSA, in collaboration with Britain's GCHQ, had routinely intercepted the international communications of prominent anti-Vietnam War leaders such as Jane Fonda and Dr. Benjamin Spock. Decades later, a multi-year investigation by the European Parliament highlighted the NSA's role in economic espionage in a report entitled 'Development of Surveillance Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information', in 1999.\n\nHowever, for the general public, it was a series of detailed disclosures of internal NSA documents in June 2013 that first revealed the massive extent of the NSA's spying, both foreign and domestic. Most of these were leaked by an ex-contractor, Edward Snowden. Even so, a number of these older global surveillance programs such as PRISM, XKeyscore, and Tempora were referenced in the 2013 release of thousands of documents. As confirmed by the NSA's director Keith B. Alexander on September 26, 2013, the NSA collects and stores all phone records of all American citizens. Much of the data is kept in large storage facilities such as the Utah Data Center, a US$1.5 billion megaproject referred to by \"The Wall Street Journal\" as a \"symbol of the spy agency's surveillance prowess.\"\n\nWartime censorship of communications during the World Wars was paralleled by peacetime decipherment of communications by the Black Chamber (Cipher Bureau, MI-8), operating with the approval of the U.S. State Department from 1919 to 1929. In 1945 the now-defunct Project SHAMROCK was created to gather all telegraphic data entering into or exiting from the United States. Major communication companies such as Western Union, RCA Global and ITT World Communications actively aided the U.S. government in the latter's attempt to gain access to international message traffic.\n\nIn 1952, the NSA was officially established. According to \"The New York Times\", the NSA was created in \"absolute secrecy\" by President Truman. Six weeks after President Truman took office, he ordered wiretaps on the telephones of Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, a close advisor of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The recorded conversations are currently kept at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum, along with other sensitive documents (~233,600 pages).\n\nUnder J. Edgar Hoover, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) carried out wide-ranging surveillance of communications and political expression, targeting many well-known speakers such as Albert Einstein, Frank Sinatra, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, Martin Luther King, Jr., A FBI memo recognized King to be the \"most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country.\", and Daniel Ellsberg, Some of these activities were eventually uncovered in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, leading to the Resignation of Richard Nixon.\n\nDuring World War II the U.K. and U.S. governments entered into a series of agreements for sharing of signals intelligence of enemy communications traffic. In March 1946, a secret agreement, the \"British-US Communication Intelligence Agreement\", known as BRUSA, was established, based on the wartime agreements. The agreement \"tied the two countries into a worldwide network of listening posts run by Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the U.K.'s biggest spying organisation, and its U.S. equivalent, the National Security Agency.\"\n\nIn 1988, an article titled \"Somebody's listening\" by Duncan Campbell in the \"New Statesman\", described the signals intelligence gathering activities of a program code-named \"ECHELON. The program was engaged by English-speaking World War II Allied powers Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States (collectively known as AUSCANNZUKUS). Based on the UKUSA Agreement, it was created to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc allies during the Cold War in the early 1960s. Though its existence had long been known, the UKUSA agreement only became public in 2010. It enabled the U.S. and the U.K. to exchange \"knowledge from operations involving intercepting, decoding and translating foreign communications.\" The agreement forbade the parties to reveal its existence to any third party.\n\nBy the late 1990s the ECHELON system was capable of intercepting satellite transmissions, public switched telephone network (PSTN) communications (including most Internet traffic), and transmissions carried by microwave. A detailed description of ECHELON was provided by New Zealand journalist Nicky Hager in his 1996 book \"Secret Power\". While the existence of ECHELON was denied by some member governments, a report by a committee of the European Parliament in 2001 confirmed the program's use and warned Europeans about its reach and effects. The European Parliament stated in its report that the term \"ECHELON\" was used in a number of contexts, but that the evidence presented indicated it was a signals intelligence collection system capable of interception and content inspection of telephone calls, fax, e-mail and other data traffic globally. The report to the European Parliament confirmed that this was a \"global system for the interception of private and commercial communications.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the scope of domestic spying in the United States increased significantly. The bid to prevent future attacks of this scale led to the passage of the Patriot Act. Later acts include the Protect America Act (which removes the warrant requirement for government surveillance of foreign targets) and the FISA Amendments Act (which relaxed some of the original FISA court requirements).\n\nIn 2005, the existence of STELLARWIND was revealed by Thomas Tamm. On January 1, 2006, days after \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"\"Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts\", the President emphasized that \"This is a limited program designed to prevent attacks on the United States of America. And I repeat, limited.\"\n\nIn 2006, Mark Klein revealed the existence of Room 641A that he had wired back in 2003. In 2008, Babak Pasdar, a computer security expert, and CEO of Bat Blue publicly revealed the existence of the \"Quantico circuit\", that he and his team found in 2003. He described it as a back door to the federal government in the systems of an unnamed wireless provider; the company was later independently identified as Verizon. Additional disclosures regarding a mass surveillance program involving U.S. citizens had been made in the U.S. media in 2006.\n\nOn November 28, 2010, WikiLeaks and five major news outlets in Spain (\"El País\"), France (\"Le Monde\"), Germany (\"Der Spiegel\"), the United Kingdom (\"The Guardian\"), and the United States (\"The New York Times\") began publishing the first 220 of 251,287 leaked U.S. State department diplomatic \"cables\" simultaneously.\n\nOn March 15, 2012, the American magazine \"Wired\" published an article with the headline \"The NSA Is Building the Country's Biggest Spy Center (Watch What You Say)\", which was later mentioned by U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson during a congressional hearing. In response to Johnson's inquiry, NSA director Keith B. Alexander testified that these allegations made by \"Wired\" magazine were untrue.\n\nIn early 2013, Edward Snowden handed over 200,000 top secret documents to various media outlets, triggering one of the biggest news leaks in the modern history of the United States.\n\n"}

The waters of the Oyashio Current originate in the Arctic Ocean and flow southward via the Bering Sea, passing through the Bering Strait and transporting cold water from the Arctic Sea into the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Okhotsk. It collides with the Kuroshio Current off the eastern shore of Japan to form the North Pacific Current (or Drift). \nThe nutrient-rich Oyashio is named for its metaphorical role as the that provides for and nurtures marine organisms.\n\nThe current has an important impact on the climate of the Russian Far East, mainly in Kamchatka and Chukotka, where the northern limit of tree growth is moved south up to ten degrees compared with the latitude it can reach in inland Siberia. The waters of the Oyashio Current form probably the richest fishery in the world owing to the extremely high-nutrient content of the cold water and the very high tides (up to ten metres) in some areas – which further enhances the availability of nutrients. However, the Oyashio Current also causes Vladivostok to be the most equatorward port to seasonally freeze and require icebreaking ships to remain open in winter. Nonetheless, this has relatively little effect on the fish yield through the Sea of Okhotsk, because the large tides mean freezing does not occur so easily.\n\nDuring glacial periods, when lower sea level exposed the Bering land bridge, the current could not flow in the regions the Oyashio affects today. The level of cooling with the onset of glacial conditions (after an interglacial) was much less than in other areas of the Earth at similar latitudes. This allowed Tōhoku and Hokkaidō – the only areas of East Asia with enough snowfall to potentially form glaciers – to remain unglaciated except at high elevations during periods when Europe and North America were largely glaciated. This lack of glaciation explains why, despite its present climate being much colder than most of Europe, East Asia has retained 96 percent of Pliocene tree genera, whereas Europe has retained only 27%.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51145563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51145563", "title": "Panjal Traps", "text": "Panjal Traps\n\nThe Panjal Traps or the Tethyan Plume is a large igneous province (LIP) that erupted during the Early–Middle Permian in what is now north-western India. The Panjal Traps are associated with the opening of the Neo-Tethys Ocean, which resulted in the dispersal of the Cimmerian continental blocks from the north-eastern margin of Gondwana and possibly the break-up of this old and large continent.\nIn the Zanskar-Spliti-Lahaul area (in the north-western Himalayas and south-east Ladakh) the -thick basalts of the Panjal Traps are mostly exposed as massive (terrestrial) lava flows, but also as (marine) pillow lavas and hyaloclastites.\n\nThe Panjal Traps were first documented in 1824 and were eventually named by British geologist Richard Lydekker in 1883, but their origin, age, and relationship with surrounding and underlying rocks remained elusive for more than a century. They remained one of the most understudied LIPs before being properly dated to 289 Ma in 2011.\n\nLate Carboniferous to Early Permian deposits of Tethyan affinity in the Zanskar-Spiti area are mostly terrigenous, detrital sedimentary rocks, although some magmatic activity documented in Pakistan and central Nepal has been associated with this period. These sedimentary layers are associated with the erosion that followed the uplift of the margins of the newly rifted Indian continent. \nIn the eastern and central Himalayas more voluminous volcanic eruptions have been documented from the same period. The Abor volcanics produced of basaltic to andesitic flows and tuffs. In the Late Permian (Sakmarian-Roadian) the theoliitic Nar-Tsum(?) produced of spilites and Bhote Kosi basalts in southern Tibet.\n\nThe slightly younger (Artinskian-Kazanian) Panjal Traps produced the largest magmatic province in north-western India. Its lava flows now covers 10 km, from the eastern Zanskar-Spliti-Lahaul area to north-eastern Pakistan and they filled a rifted valley called the Zanskar-Spiti synclinorium.\nThe original extent of the Panjal Traps may have exceeded 0.2x10 km, a distribution similar to those of the Emeishan LIP in south-western China and the Columbia River basalts in north-western United States.\nIn Ladakh and in the Kashmir Basin the flows are thick with a smaller amount of pyroclastics overlain by aphyric basaltic flows. In north-eastern Pakistan the Panjal flows are exposed as dykes cross-cutting the basement and Early Paleozoic layers, and as inter-layered magmatic flows on Late Plaeozoic to Early Mesozoic layers with Tethyan affinity.\n\nThe eruption of the Panjal Traps was followed (Kazanian-Djulfian) by the emplacement of a succession of sediments, the result of the progressive thermo-tectonic subsidence of the Indian passive margin associated with the expanding Neo-Tethys.\n\nThe Panjal Traps have been associated with either the Mid-Capitanian (260 Ma) or End-Permian (251 Ma) mass extinction events. Analyses of zircon crystals have, however, yielded an U/Pb age of 289±2 Ma — considerably older than these mass extinctions.\nThe Panjal Traps can, nevertheless, be linked to the African large low-shear-velocity province (or superplume) and, as such, is most likely responsible for the widespread flood basalts in the Himalayas, but the Siberian Traps (251 Ma) are probably a better candidate for these younger mass extinctions.\n\nLate Carboniferous-Permian LIPs (such as Jutland, Panjal, Tarim, Emeishan and Siberia) were emplaced before the break-up of Pangaea whereas the post-Permian LIPs were involved in the break-up of the supercontinent. Mantle plume-derived LIPs share features such as large-volume flood basalts, short duration, uplift and doming of the crust before eruption, and high temperature-melts such as komatiites and picrites.\nThe chemical and isotopic composition of samples of basalt taken from the eastern Kashmir Valley are similar to within-plate basalts, and probably derived from a spinel peridotite source. Samples taken from the western side of the valley are more primitive, derived from a more depleted source. This suggests that Panjal made a transition from a newly formed continental setting, where the basalt composition was 'enriched OIB-like', to an old ocean basin, where the composition was 'depleted MORB-like'. Chemically, the Panjal basalts are similar to those from post-Permian/post-Pangaean LIPs.\n\nPaleomagnetic data from the Kashmir Valley indicate the Panjal eruption occurred at a paleolatitude of c. 33° (±5°)S.\n\n"}

A voice from heaven told Peter to kill and eat, but since the vessel (or sheet, ὀθόνη, \"othonē\") contained unclean animals, Peter declined. The command was repeated two more times, along with the voice saying, \"What God hath made clean, that call not thou common\" (verse 15) and then the vessel was taken back to heaven (verse 16).\n\nAt this point in the narrative, messengers sent from Cornelius the Centurion arrive and urge Peter to go with them. He does so, and mentions the vision as he speaks to Cornelius, saying \"God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean\" (). Peter related the vision again in .\n\nSimon J. Kistemaker suggests that the lesson God taught Peter in this vision is that \"God has removed the barriers he once erected to separate his people from the surrounding nations.\" Kistemaker argues that it means Peter has to accept Gentile believers as full members of the Christian Church, but also that God has made all animals clean, so that \"Peter with his fellow Jewish Christians can disregard the food laws that have been observed since the days of Moses.\" Albert Mohler, President of Southern Seminary, writes:\nAs the Book of Acts makes clear, Christians are not obligated to follow this holiness code. This is made clear in Peter's vision in Acts 10:15. Peter is told, 'What God has made clean, do not call common.' In other words, there is no kosher code for Christians. Christians are not concerned with eating kosher foods and avoiding all others. That part of the law is no longer binding, and Christians can enjoy shrimp and pork with no injury to conscience.\n\nLuke Timothy Johnson and Daniel J. Harrington write that this episode heralds a radical change in Peter's \"identity as a member of God's people,\" but also that \"the implication is that all things God created are declared clean by him, and are not affected by human discriminations.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the United Church of God (a group following the teachings of Herbert W. Armstrong) calls this an \"often-misunderstood section of the Bible\", arguing that Peter's statement in verse 28 indicates that the divine disclosure reflected only a teaching about people, and not one about food. The UCG argues that Peter realised \"the puzzling vision could not be annulling God’s instructions.\" The Seventh-day Adventist Church has a similar view of this passage.\n\nPeter's triple refusal described in echoes the denial of Peter described in the Synoptic Gospels.\n\nPeter's vision was rarely shown in art, but has been illustrated with pen-and-ink drawings by Rembrandt and a variant by his pupil van Hoogstraten. Rembrandt was probably reacting to a painting of the subject by Domenico Fetti which was then in Amsterdam, and is now in Vienna. It also appears in the \"Altar of St. Peter\" in Seville Cathedral, attributed to Francisco de Zurbarán.\n"}
{"id": "2442000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2442000", "title": "Piacenzian", "text": "Piacenzian\n\nThe Piacenzian is in the international geologic time scale the upper stage or latest age of the Pliocene. It spans the time between 3.6 ± 0.005 Ma and 2.588 ± 0.005 Ma (million years ago). The Piacenzian is after the Zanclean and is followed by the Gelasian (part of the Pleistocene).\n\nThe Piacenzian is roughly coeval with the European land mammal age MN 16, overlaps the late Chapadmalalan and early Uquian South American land mammal age and falls inside the more extensive Blancan North American land mammal age. It also correlates with the Astian, Redonian, Reuverian and Romanian regional stages of Europe. Some authorities describe the British Red Crag Formation and Waltonian stage as late Piacenzian, while others regard them as early Pleistocene.\n\nThe Piacenzian was introduced in scientific literature by Swiss stratigrapher Karl Mayer-Eymar in 1858. It is named after the Italian city of Piacenza.\n\nThe base of the Piacenzian is at the base of magnetic chronozone C2An (the base of the Gauss chronozone and at the extinction of the planktonic forams \"Globorotalia margaritae\" and \"Pulleniatina primalis\". The GSSP for the Piacenzian stage is at Punta Piccola on Sicily, Italy.\n\nThe top of the Piacenzian (the base of the Quaternary system and the Pleistocene series) is defined magnetostratigraphically as the base of the Matuyama (C2r) chronozone (at the Gauss-Matuyama reversal), and isotopic stage 103. Above this point there are notable extinctions of the calcareous nanofossils: \"Discoaster pentaradiatus\" and \"Discoaster surculus\".\n\nClimate of the Piacenzian would have started as a somewhat wet and warm period in North America occurring just after a brief cooling period of the Zanclean. Deposition of sediments and mollusks of the Piacenzian correspond with the rise in sea level creating the Tamiami Subsea and Jackson Subsea of Florida, Duplin Subsea generally of South Carolina, and Yorktown Subsea of the Outer Banks and inland North Carolina. Dates have been established on the basis of the genera and species of mollusks found.\n\nThe late Piacenzian may be when the genus \"Homo\" developed out of the ancestral genus \"Australopithecus\". While the oldest known fossils unambiguously identified as \"Homo habilis\" date to just after the end of the Piacenzian (2.58 Ma), a fossilized jawbone that exhibits traits that are transitional between \"Australopithecus\" and \"Homo habilis\" was discovered in the Afar Triangle in 2015.\nThe find was made by Ethiopian student Chalachew Seyoum at a site called Ledi-Geraru between the Mille and Awash rivers, in Afar Regional State (near ). Based on geological evidence from the Afar region, the individual would have lived just after a major climate shift, during which forests and waterways were rapidly replaced by arid savanna. Regarding the Afar region, and as stated in the journal \"Science\": \"Vertebrate fossils record a faunal turnover indicative of more open and probable arid habitats than those reconstructed earlier in this region, in broad agreement with hypotheses addressing the role of environmental forcing in hominin evolution at this time.\" This interpretation is consistent with hypotheses that emphasize the savanna as the ancestral environment that shaped the evolution of early \"Homo\" and other hominins.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43255083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43255083", "title": "Public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment", "text": "Public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment\n\nPublic plans for energy efficient refurbishment are put in place by states to encourage building owners to renovate their properties in a way that increases their energy performance. As financing represents the most important obstacle to this type of renovation, the plans favour financial incentives in the form of loans or grants. Various institutions can be involved in the process, such as ministries, banks, firms, or energy services companies (ESCOs).\n\nA number of countries have implemented such plans: the United States, France, Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, Estonia, and others.\n\nThe concept of PACE (Property-Assessed Clean Energy) was inspired by “solar bonds” program implemented in San Francisco in 2001. It was meant to overcome the major barrier to the installation of solar and energy efficiency retrofits in commercial or residential properties: high up-front costs. The principle consisted in “on-tax bill solar and efficiency financing,” whereby repayment of the investment in measures is made through a property tax assessment.\n\nPACE originated in 2008 with pilot programs in California, Colorado, and New York, that focused primarily on energy efficiency upgrades to single family homes. The first actual PACE program was carried out in Berkeley, California, and the state passed the first PACE-enabling legislation in 2008.\n\nIn the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, on July 30, 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) was created to supervise enterprises and banks (the \"regulated entities\"), after Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association)'s bankruptcy. At the time, most homes had a market value below the volume of contracted loans, following the burst of the housing bubble. In July 2010, the FHFA issued the first of many directives that effectively ban Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from buying or holding mortgages with PACE assessments. PACE therefore shifted its focus over the next year toward commercial, industrial, multi-family and agricultural buildings and properties.\n\nPACENow, is a national advocate for PACE, defines its mission as “\"to promote and assist the development of PACE programs by state and local governments and provide leadership and support for a growing universe of energy efficiency and PACE stakeholders.\"”\n\nPACE funding is provided (using various sources) or arranged by local governments for 100% of a project's cost, and is repaid with an assessment over a term of up to 20 years.\n\nKfW (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, meaning Reconstruction Credit Institute) is a German government-owned development bank, based in Frankfurt. The bank was created in 1948 after the Second World War as part of the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe.\n\nThe KfW Förderbank (KfW promotional bank) is today its largest business unit, committed to housing and environmental protection. KfW introduced the Efficiency House Standard in 2009, to identify levels of energy efficiency in houses and provide loans or grants accordingly. Its activities devoted to bringing down CO emissions align with a strategy designed by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) in 2010, following the decision to speed up the pace of nuclear energy phase-out. This strategy outlined the directions to be privileged in the following years to achieve the desired level of energy efficiency. Among others, it asked to significantly raise the efficiency standards for buildings, to increase funds available for building improvement, and to implement tools to help ensure that new buildings gradually comply with the futureEuropean standards for nearly zero energy buildings. The KfW created promotional programmes targeting private buyers and homeowners, landlords and housing companies, to support refurbishment of older residential buildings with grants or loans.\n\nThe German government announced in its “Energy Concept” strategy that it aims at reducing CO emissions by 80% in 2050 (the base year is 1990). Between 1990 and 2010, annual CO emissions have fallen at an average annual growth rate of -1.1%. This rate is not large enough to reach the 80% reduction goal; emissions should decrease at a rate of 3.4% per year from now on.\n\nThe most important sector contributing to CO emissions is the production and distribution of energy and water (42% of total emissions), and the second-most important one is that of private households (22%). The government has thus decided that efforts must be focused on two pillars: increased energy efficiency in existing buildings, and a larger share of renewable electricity. In order to ensure a reduction of energy consumption in existing buildings, it has decided to promote their rehabilitation, and has committed to carrying out thermal retrofits on 2% of the building stock each year. The realization of these goals is precisely what KfW's promotional programs are targeting.\n\nThe bank has set six levels of promotional incentives for energy efficiency refurbishment activities, expressed as Efficiency House Standards 55, 70, 85, 100, 115, and “Monument”. These numbers represent the energy consumption of the housing unit as a percentage of the maximum primary energy requirement specified by the Energy Conservation Ordinance (EnEV). The lower the rating, the greater the energy efficiency. For example, a “KfW Efficiency House 70” consumes 70% of this requirement. As such, the best standard (55) receives the greatest support. To meet the energy standard for an efficient home, heating systems, thermal wall insulation, roof and floor insulation and windows are required. Promotional funds are available either through a loan, or through a grant.\n\nThe involvement of an energy consultant is mandatory in the application process, and must be contracted by the applicant himself.\n\nThe “KfW Energy Efficient Renovation - Supplementary Credit” programme offers low interest loans specifically for the replacement of the heating and domestic hot water systems that were installed before 2009. The loans can be up to €50,000, and have a 10-year maturity at a fixed interest rate.\n\nThe Federal Office of Economics and Export Control (BAFA) offers grants in certain situations to cover expenses in on-site energy consultancy in residential buildings (on-site consulting). The maximum grant cannot exceed 50% of the total gross cost of the consultation.\n\nKfW obtains its funding on the capital markets, where it benefits from an AAA credit rating and a 100% guarantee from the German government. It obtains around €80 billion annually on the international capital markets. KfW thus provides refinancing loans to commercial banks at advantageous rates. KfW does not lend directly to individuals; loans have to go through commercial banks. The interest rate for the promotional loans distributed by the commercial banks is further subsidized by funds provided by the . KfW also receives additional funding from the “Energy and Climate fund”, used to finance the preferential loans and the grants. Grants are distributed directly by KfW to individuals.\n\nIn 2012, KfW Group had dedicated €29.2 billion to its “Climate change and environment” department, making it its largest activity and its core priority. The latest data on the KfW programs’ achievements shows positive results: between 2006 and 2012, the programs led to an average reduction of 5.9 Mt CO equivalents per year.\n\nMore specifically on KfW's refurbishment programmes, the commitment volume in 2012 was €10.1 billion, and financed investments amounted to €27.3 billion. Still in 2012, 240,000 housing units were refurbished to higher energy efficiency levels, and 116,000 new energy efficient housing units were built.\n\nIn terms of energy conservation, the energy use in newly retrofitted buildings has decreased from approximately 120 kWh per square meter per annum to 80 kWh/sm/p.a.\n\nIn 2010, the KfW entered into a partnership with the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), whereby the KfW provided a dedicated credit line of €50 Million to finance energy efficiency projects in micro, small and medium enterprises in India. The aim is to encourage MSMEs (Micro Small and Medium Enterprises) to undertake energy-saving investments in plant and machinery, and in production processes. KfW has also provided technical assistance to help SIDBI identify key MSME clusters, set up the financing streams, and conduct awareness campaigns.\n\nA study on the macroeconomic effects of the German government's building rehabilitation programs has been conducted to assess the impact from the investment projects on the public revenue, the housing industry and the climate policy. The analysis focused on short-term effects (the effects taking place in the corresponding year). For the years 2008, 2009 and 2010, the analysis took into account the program cost (the opportunity cost of providing funds for the KfW promotional programs instead of using them elsewhere), and calculated the revenues from the value added tax paid by investors, net taxes on products, net taxes on production, payroll tax and SSC (Social Security Contributions) including solidarity surcharge, corporate income tax, and other income taxes including solidarity surcharge. Because it is not clear whether the additional demand for labour is met through overtime work or through additional jobs, the analysis provides two scenarios; one named “overtime”, where the demand impulse does not create additional jobs, and the second named “jobs”, where the opposite is true. In the latter, the avoided cost of unemployment is added as a revenue.\n\nIn any scenario, results clearly show that the public revenue has been positively impacted by the investment projects.\n\n\nThe conclusion from this study is three-fold: first, KfW promotional programs result in important energy use and emissions reduction. Not only is this environmentally valuable, it also helps to reduce Germany's import dependence on manufacturing and energy sources. Second, the programs strengthen the demand for labour-intensive activities such as construction services, thereby reducing unemployment. Finally, the net effect of the programs on the public budget is undeniably positive, as a weighing of program costs against induced revenues shows.\n\nThe KredEx scheme was designed based on the German federal bank (KfW) model, a pioneer in the use of a revolving fund to finance energy efficient building renovation.\n\nThe success of the KredEx scheme relies mainly on the political impetus it was given at the time of its creation. This allowed to raise a considerable amount of funding from the EU Structural Funds, a first in Europe for this type of program.\n\nThe political impetus also allowed for the development of a legal framework propitious to the distribution of funds under preferential terms, to widen adoption of the program by end beneficiaries.\n\nApartment building associations who wish to undertake renovation works must undertake an energy audit in order to apply for the loan or grant. It is their responsibility to contract construction companies and supervisors for the works (who check that the works respect the terms of the loan).\n\nThe proposed loans are advantageous in their longer maturity (up to 20 years), lower interest rates (from 4.3%), and rates fixed for a period of 10 years. Grants are available for those who wish to undertake more comprehensive refurbishment. The combination of grants and loans has proven beneficial: grants motivate project adoption, and long term favourable loans are needed to make the investment accessible. \nExpected energy savings are way above the level that was initially set as a target.\n\nEstonia is one of the most attractive country in Eastern Europe in terms of FDI (Foreign Direct Investment), thanks to a high credit rating (A), low labour costs, a modern technological infrastructure, and favourable regulatory and tax policies. Environmental policy is designed by the Ministry of Environment, whereas energy policy is managed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications.\n\nUnder the EU's burden-sharing agreement for reduction of CO2 emissions, Estonia was mandated to reduce greenhouse gases by 8% over 1990 values between 2008 and 2012. Energy efficiency in buildings is a high priority for the Estonian Government: 60% of housing was built between 1960 and 1990, around 95% is privately owned, and 75% of the population lives in multi-apartment buildings.\n\nKredEx was created in 2001 to help Estonian companies develop, raise finance, and expand their exports. Another aim was to support the upgrade and renovation of domestic housing, and its primary focus has gradually shifted to the development of financial products that support retrofit of apartment buildings. It provides various financial products, such as loans and loan guarantees, as well as grants for renovation, efficiency audits and evaluations.\n\nKredEx is a state-owned credit and export guarantee fund (not a public bank), created in 2001 by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications as a not-for-profit entity. Sureties and guarantees issued by KredEx are fully backed by a state guarantee. It was established as a body governed by private law, operating in the public interest according to State policies.\n\nKredEx works as a revolving fund that, among other activities, supports financing of energy efficiency projects. It has received loans from the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) to undertake measures aimed at complying with the Council's Directive 2002/91/EC on the energy performance of buildings. KredEx also receives funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).\n\nImportant other stakeholders in the program include the commercial banks Swedbank and SEB, which get favourable funding from KredEx and make loans to apartment building associations. Their main motivation to take part in the program was to get access to more clients, especially at the beginning of the financial crisis. They have also had very good experiences with financing energy refurbishment of buildings prior to 2009.\n\nKredEx also works in cooperation with some international bodies, in particular other state-owned financial institutions: in 2007, it signed a Memorandum of Understanding with KfW Bankengruppe (Germany), BGK (Poland), and Hipotēku Banka (Latvia), on the structuring and implementation of large financing programmes to promote energy efficiency in housing, for which KfW provided advice.\n\nThe KredEx scheme aims to motivate apartment building owners to reduce energy consumption and increase the energy efficiency of their homes by providing preferential loans and grants under certain conditions. In 2009, the stated goal was to renovate at least 1,000 buildings within the framework of the following years in order to deem the program successful. The targeted energy savings are of approximately 30% for renovated buildings.\n\nSince 2003, KredEx has been committed to supporting energy efficiency through loans and grants. Until 2007, KredEx has worked under a simple grant scheme. For energy audits, building designs and technical expertise, up to 50% of the costs are provided in grants; this part of the scheme is still continuing today. For renovation, up to 10% of the costs were provided through grants; through this scheme, KredEx achieved renovation of 3,200 buildings, for an amount of €11 Million. The problems with this approach were insufficient funding, limitation to “single works”, and the fact that grants are only available after payments (building owners had to provide the entirety of up-front costs).\n\nKredEx therefore shifted to a revolving fund approach, to widen the opportunities for refurbishment of buildings, receive greater financial support from the state, and reduce administration costs.\n\nIn 2010, Estonia became the first country to channel EU Structural Funds into apartment buildings renovation programs:\n\n\nIn 2009, the Fund amounted to €49 Million. Progressively, KredEx added up to €10 Million to the Fund from its profits. In 2013, the Estonian State provided a loan of €16 Million to KredEx, and the capital was increased to €72.6 Million.\n\nThe Fund is used to offer preferential loans for building refurbishment, distributed through two commercial banks, Swedbank and SEB Estonia. The advantages of the loans disbursed through the banks are:\n\n\nThe renovation loan programme was developed by KredEx, together with the KfW (Germany), and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications. Apartment Building Renovation Loans, introduced in 2009, are available for apartment buildings constructed before 1993. Loans cannot be applied for by individual homeowners. Only apartment associations, building associations and communities of apartment owners in buildings with at least 3 apartments are eligible.\n\nThe main terms for the loans are as follows:\n\n\nAside from loans, grants are also available to help finance the independent energy audit (including monitoring after the renovation) and project design documents. It can be used to decrease the share of self-financing, or by apartment buildings constructed after 1993 (which do not belong to the renovation loan target group of KredEx) to be combined with a regular loan. The goal of the grant scheme is to motivate building owners to achieve complete renovation of the buildings, without leaving important energy saving measures aside. The grants are distributed in the amount of 15%, 25% and 35% of the total project cost, depending on the level of energy savings achieved, under the following conditions:\n\n\"15% Grant\"\n\n\n\"25% Grant\"\n\n\n\"35% Grant\"\n\n\nApplication for the renovation loan has to be made through Swedbank or SBE.\n\nPrior to making the application, building owners must contract an energy auditor themselves, and put together the required documents (energy audit, energy consumption reports, construction bids...) on their own. KredEx thus comes in after the applicants’ process of making the decision to renovate and of forming the project (the budget has to be all set out before the application is made). After a loan and/or grant is approved, it is the building owner's responsibility to find a construction company that will undertake the renovation works, and to contract a supervisor that will make sure loan terms are respected.\n\n\"Number of renovations\": When the KredEx fund was launched in 2009, the objective was to finance at least 1,000 buildings. By the end of 2013, 798 buildings were renovated. 415 buildings used reconstruction grant and KredEx soft loan, 185 buildings used only KredEx loan, and 198 buildings used only reconstruction grant.\n\n\"Average amounts\": The average loan amount in 2011 was €100,000, the average self-financing was 27.9% and the average length of loan period was 15.2 years. In terms of grants, the average amount in 2011 was €26,192.\n\n\"Energy savings\": For apartment loans, the average predicted savings achieved with the reconstruction work is 39.3%, way above the initial targets of 20 or 30%. This saving relates to an after-works consumption of 75 GWh per year on average.\n\nThe City of Melbourne is one of the most innovative cities in Australia in terms of sustainability, and has been devoted for many years to reducing its carbon footprint.\n\nIn 2002, the City published Zero Net Emissions by 2020 - A Roadmap to a Climate Neutral City, setting an ambitious target. The strategy is backed by innovative projects such as 1200 Buildings, launched in 2010, aimed at the energy efficient refurbishment of commercial (non-residential) buildings. As stated by 1200 Buildings’ targets, “\"fifty percent of the municipality’s greenhouse gas emissions are generated by the commercial sector. If commercial buildings improve their energy efficiency by approximately 38 percent, 383,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2-e) will be eliminated per year\"”.\n\n1200 Buildings published a survey report in 2013 to assess the evolution of the program and its results, drawing a picture of the rate and type of retrofitting achieved, and listing drivers and perceived barriers to the project. The report indicates successful, encouraging results in terms of the level of retrofit activity.\n\nTo finance environmental retrofits, which is the key challenge in these initiatives, the City of Melbourne developed an innovative finance mechanism. It required an amendment to the City of Melbourne Act 2001 by the state Government of Victoria, enabling Melbourne to levy a new form of statutory charge, the Environmental Upgrade Finance. This new type of finance allows the City of Melbourne, in partnership with Australian financial institutions, to enter into voluntary environmental upgrade agreements with non-residential building owners to finance retrofitting of the buildings.\n\nEnvironmental Upgrade Finance is available through the 1200 Buildings program, and is administered through the Sustainable Melbourne Fund on behalf of the City of Melbourne.\n\nAs stated on the 1200 Buildings program's website, its aims are to:\n\n\n1200 Buildings aims to retrofit about 70% of the commercial office buildings, which represents 1200 of them, whence the name of the program.\n\nEnvironmental upgrade agreements are the cornerstone of 1200 Building's financial arrangements. An environmental upgrade agreement is a tripartite contract between a building owner, a bank and the City of Melbourne. When the agreement is established, the lending body (bank) forwards the retrofit loan to the owner. The City of Melbourne then collects the loan repayment through a rates charge (the amount funded is declared by the Melbourne City Council as an environmental upgrade charge), and finally passes it back to the bank. Council rates and charges take precedence over mortgages as charges against property. This means any debt owing to Council will take priority, thereby greatly reducing the risk for banks.\n\nConditions to be met before EUA is applied:\n\n\nAccording to 1200 Buildings, the benefits of using EUAs include:\n\n\nOwners have the option of sharing the cost with their tenants because Council rates and charges are generally passed through to tenants by the property owner under the terms of a net lease (the legislation requires that any such arrangement can only be made with the tenants’ consent) → The objective is to overcome the split incentive barrier.\n\nThree environmental upgrade agreements have been signed in Melbourne for projects with a total value of $5.6 million.\n\nThe first quarter of 2014 has seen significant changes in EUA legislation. New legislation will allow all councils in South Australia to initiate a Building Upgrade Finance program, similar to the City of Melbourne legislation, whereby the loan is tied to the property.\n\nThe City of Melbourne oversees the projects. It mainly uses its website to promote the program, via examples of existing retrofits, lists of “big company” signatories, and case studies.\n\nWhile the City accompanies building owners in their journey and can provide help at all steps of the project, owners are left on their own to undertake their energy audit, select and hire consultants and contractors, apply for permits... Therefore, planification, implementation, operations, updates and assessment are left to the charge of contractors, through tenders managed by the building owners themselves. Consultants and contractors can be architects, builders, commissioning agents, electrical engineers, energy auditors, energy performance contractors, environmentally sustainable design consultants, fire engineers, hydraulic engineers, installation contractors, mechanical engineers, and project managers.\n\nThe Energy Efficiency Council (EEC) is a body designed to help companies undertake energy efficiency measures, providing a platform for energy efficiency and cogeneration products and services, and is thus used by commercial building owners to find consultants and contractors. The Council was formed in 2009, and incorporates the members and activities of the Australasian Energy Performance Contracting Alliance (AEPCA).\n\nOnce a commercial building owner is convinced to undertake retrofitting, the first step is for him to become a “signatory” of the project, by sending the Lord Mayor a signed copy of the “1200 Buildings Letter of commitment”. The owner then selects a model for implementing its project:\n\n\nAccording to the Melbourne Retrofit Survey 2013, between 2008 and 2013, 25% of Melbourne's commercial buildings had retrofitted or were currently undertaking a retrofit, indicating an acceleration of retrofit activity compared to 21% between 2006 and 2011. In 2013, 16% of the buildings surveyed claimed they were intending to undertake a retrofit within the next five years, a significant increase from the 10% in 2011. Most of the retrofits recently undertaken were self-funded (81%), and only 1% had used Environmental Upgrade Finance. 40% of owners surveyed declared they were “not at all interested” in Environmental Upgrade Finance. These numbers indicate a certain lack of interest in 1200 Buildings’ financing mechanism, possibly caused by a lack of awareness or understanding of its benefits.\n\nStill, the 1200 Buildings program counts 53 signatories to date, including “big name” corporations such as ING, Asia Pacific Group, Hilton, and Stockland. Four buildings have used Environmental Upgrade Agreements to access finance to retrofit, representing $5.6 million of investment and aiming to save 5660 tonnes carbon emissions and $491,000 in energy costs per year.\n\nIn March 2014, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) announced it will provide finance of up to $30 million for EUAs, bringing the total to a joint amount of $80 million allocated for EUAs.\n\nThe Marshall Plan 2.Green was first developed and experimented in Wallonia, before being applied to the Brussels region.\n\nIn August 2005, the Walloon Government adopted priority actions for the Walloon future: the \"Marshall Plan\", gathering €1.2 billion.\n\nAfter promising results, the Walloon Government renewed the initiative in 2009 through a “Marshall Plan 2.Green”. The plan organizes around 6 pillars (human capital valorization, company network creation, scientific research support, quality jobs and activities creation, employment-environment alliances, social employment and well-being) and cross-cutting dynamics.\n\nThe Marshall Plan 2.Green gathers a total of €1.6 billion of conventional credit, to which €1.15 billion of alternative financing have been added. That is, almost €3 billion for the 2010-2014 time frame.\n\nThe 5th pillar of the Marshall Plan 2.Green, Employment-Environment Alliances, focuses on the sustainable aspect of the development plan. Its objective, set in 2009, is to “\"support a new economic development model, sustainable and solidary, via employment-environment alliances constituting an opportunity in terms of employment, economic development, and environmental challenges. Positioning Wallonia as a sustainable development leader at the European and international levels, by developing a regarded expertise, while creating domestic employment.\"”\n\nThe EEA is notably the first alliance with a “green construction” aspect. The Walloon housing sector is highly inefficient: nearly 44% of housing is badly isolated, and average energy consumption is 72% above the European average. The first measure aims at developing a multi-year plan for energy savings and sustainable construction, and a multi-sectorial contract. The objective is to “concentrate on the potential of energetic and environmental improvements of buildings to generate employment, create economic opportunities, increase training notably in sustainable construction jobs.”\n\nVarious public and private decision makers, as well as concerned social partners and field actors are involved in the EEA. The Ministry of Sustainable Development is entrusted with EEA coordination. In February 2012, 41 multi-sectorial contracts have been signed with partners for the first Employment-Environment Alliance. Federations of construction companies, public interest and services organizations, unions, training operators, as well as groups and associations involved in sustainable development and construction participated in this process.\n\nThe 3 commitments of the multi-sectorial contracts signatory:\n\n\nThe first EEA's principal objective is to “\"concentrate on the potential of energetic and environmental improvements of buildings to generate employment, create economic opportunities, increase training notably in sustainable construction jobs.\"” To do so, four dimensions are considered:\n\n\nThe multi-annual plan comprises around 50 measures declined around 3 specific objectives:\n\n\nIn order to reinforce the attractiveness of sustainable investments in the housing sector, the EEA action plan focuses on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe partnership articulates around the implementation of a “one-stop shop” and of EEA contact points that accompany households all along their renovation project. The PHP aims at stimulating demand for private housing renovation through a reform of the energy and housing bonuses, the availability of attractive financing and of complementary incentives.\n\nThis measure aims at correctly informing and accompanying Walloon citizens in the whole of their renovation project. The “one-stop shops” accompany the individuals all along their administrative proceedings, centralizing the information and formalities for greater efficiency and visibility.\n\nIts missions:\n\n\nThe building passport includes information relative to the EU Directive on the energy performance of buildings and to the Energy Advice Procedure (EAP), and takes into account other dimensions such as material use, location, and wholesomeness. This building passport aims to become a unique database integrating all dimensions linked to renovation, including EAPs and works recommendations.\n\nEnergy Performance Certificates are classified according to the address of the house, instead of the individual's identity. This allows for a house's new owner to know the history of proceedings and diagnostics already performed on his property. The certificate is valid for 10 years, providing that no modifications are made on the energy equipment. Its realization is carried out by an approved certifier who, after examining the building, has to mention various informations:\n\n\nThe one-stop shop system includes a pool of “EEA Advisors” inside the contact points. These advisors work hand in hand with the teams established in the contact points and are in charge of instructing financial arrangement files and of establishing the building “passport”.\n\nIn total, around 250 EEA Advisors are scattered over the entire Walloon territory (one advisor for 5 000 houses). The intention is to reach an audience that does not come to the information counter by itself, and so to take them by the hand from the beginning. To do so, the government launches calls for collective projects by neighbourhood, destined to the associative and communal services. In exchange for subventions for operations and after fixing quantitative objectives, these organizations are tasked with the proximity work in a neighbourhood (door to door solicitation, information meetings with an EEA Advisor...).\n\nBefore the creation of the EEA, numerous financial incentives for the residential sector existed, but were often dissociated, granted by different administrations and sometimes incoherent (e.g. isolation bonus granted by the Energy Department, and woodwork renovation bonus granted by the Housing Department).\n\nWithin the EEA, Walloon households can benefit from an “\"Ecopack\"”: a type of financing that covers 100% of the renovation cost, constituted by existing bonuses (energy and housing) put together, and by a 0% loan for the part that is not covered by bonuses. The two bonuses are unified and disbursed at once, with a possibility to pre-finance, based on a thorough quotation (i.e. the financing is disbursed as soon as the works are accepted, rather than at the end of the renovation, allowing the household to avoid financing the payments to the contractor during the works).\n\nDepending on the applicant's income, a rate is applied to the bonuses (from +10% for high incomes to +40% for low incomes). The repayment duration of the 0% loan is lengthened for the lowest income categories: from 5 years for high incomes to 12 years for low incomes. The 10% highest income households cannot benefit from the Ecopack.\n\nThis mechanism is operational since March 2012, and is met with great success (especially as the federal tax credit has disappeared).\n\nThe 0% loans component is funded by a regional budget system of recoverable advances, made available to households by the structures tasked with implementing and managing the mechanism. The bonuses component of the system is funded by conventional budget allocations dedicated to the “energy” and “housing” bonuses. The system falls within a global budget envelope aimed at maintaining the volume of 0% loans at €150 million.\n\nThe Ecopack is granted by the FLW (Walloon Housing Fund) for large families and by the SWCS (Walloon Social Credit Company) for the rest of households. Beneficiary households repay their 0% loan directly to the structures tasked with implementing the mechanism, which then repay the recoverable advances granted by the Walloon Region. The resources from the repayments are distributed by Wallonia to a budgetary fund. The funds can then be reallocated (revolving fund), in the form of new recoverable advances, to the managing structures, so that they can grant new 0% loans to households, while respecting the €150 million limit.\n\nThe necessary condition to access financing is to undertake at least two types of different renovation works, for an investment above €2,500, following a “sustainable bunch” logic. The objective of the EEA is to entice households to undertake a more ambitious project instead of settling for punctual renovation, and so provoke a greater marginal effect on the energetic quality of their house.\n\nAn eligible “bunch” is composed of at least two types of sustainable renovation works, with at least one of “energetic performance” type.\n\nThe “energetic performance” type works are the following:\n\n\nOther accepted works in the “bunch” are:\n\n\nThe priority ranking of the works is established with the household, on an ad hoc basis, by the EEA advisor on the basis of elements provided by the applicant, and if the household desires, on the basis of a site visit or of an eventual EAP audit. The EEA advisor makes an analysis note of the bunch request and gives an opinion, which will be used by the Back Office in its financing request study.\n\nIn the “energetic performance” type works, the roof thermic isolation has priority. If, in his analysis, the EEA advisor estimates that this work is necessary, this priority shall be considered for certain low-income categories as an entire bunch.\n\nEEA financing is capped at a maximum of €30,000 per works bunch. A maximum of two bunches per house on a 3 years period is eligible for EEA financing, i.e. a maximum cap of €60,000/house/3 years period.\n\nWithin the development of a quality offer, training for EEA jobs, in particular for the first Alliance, is a particularly important issue, because it determines the firms’ capacity to employ adequate personnel, and opens insertion opportunities to job seekers and professional progression opportunities to workers. The two privileged formation axes are continuous training, and on the middle term, initial training.\n\nThe objective is for Wallonia to have a label that allows to guarantee the quality of the works to clients, and to identify professionals from a qualitative point of view.\n\nThe label is used as a quality reference for the public, and, at some point, as a reference for financial incentives.\n\nIn order to reinforce and improve the offer, 80 accompanying jobs have been created in 2012 to help companies formulate their transition strategies towards green construction and allow for time to implement them. Specific help for firms has been put in place via roundtables on EEA jobs, contractor clubs and awareness and vulgarization campaigns.\n\nTrainings are organized for various audiences. The objective is to integrate new competences linked to green jobs in training repositories, teaching programs, and trainers' training.\n\nBeyond renovation of the private housing stock, a number of measures in the EEA target public buildings:\n\n\nEEA coordination is managed by the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Public Service, Energy, Housing and Research. A coordination cell mandated with the implementation of the multi-annual plan and multi-sectorial contracts is part of the administration services. Its mission is to elaborate evaluation and impact indicators of the EEA. The cell is under direct authority of the Minister mandated with EEA coordination, who organizes implementation and works.\n\nThe ministers have a decisional power on all measures of the multi-annual plan. The majority of the executive power (27 measures) is delegated to Walloon public actors, and the rest is scattered between extra-regional public actors, private sector companies federations, other private sector actors, associative sector actors, clusters, and training centres. Administrative or budgetary management is entirely in the hands of Walloon public actors.\n\nIn the framework of the Marshall Plan 2.Green evaluation, thematic evaluations have been carried out during realization of the Plan, and a global evaluation at the end of programming, by the IWEPS (Walloon Institute for Evaluation, Prospective and Statistics).\n\nSteering for the implementation of the “Green construction” axis of the Alliance is carried out by a mixed follow-up committee, presided by a representative of the minister mandated with EEA coordination and composed of representatives of ministers of the Kern (i.e. restricted Council of Ministers), of the administration, unions, and construction sectors.\n\nEach axis of the Marshall Plan 2.Green has a specific budget. The budgetary envelope is closed and the budgetary means shall be allocated exclusively to public policies part of the plan, except in case of a decision made by the Walloon executive.\n\nA budget made of €1.6 billion of ordinary credits and €1.15 billion of alternative financing is devoted to the implementation of the measures, for the whole 2010-2014 period. The annual MP2.Green financing represents 4.2% of the Walloon region budget.\n\nThe financing source of the different measures depends on their nature:\n\n\nThe new policies of the Plan that target the development of sustainable investments in the housing sector and the increase in welcoming structures are largely financed by alternative credit (70%).\n\nIn 2009, the total EEA budget was of €279,6 million of ordinary financing and €600 million of alternative financing, i.e. a planned total of €880 million over the Plan's duration.\n\nThe details of the budgets engaged in the EEA are as follows:\n\nVarious awareness actions, other than direct help, have occurred towards owners, tenants, companies and merchants, with a total of 870,000 persons sensitized in one way or another over the legislation duration.\n\nThrough jobs creation, EEA measures benefited 420,000 employees and 15,600 employers over the legislation. €1 million invested in the sector allows to create or maintain 10 jobs for 1 year. On average in a year, 4,700 jobs are linked to the EEA over the 2010-2014 period.\n\nThis kind of policy brings about an important return effect (on the middle and long term) that benefits federal, regional and local public finances: value added tax revenues, corporation tax, tax on individuals, communal additions to the tax on individuals, Social Security National Office contributions, reduction of unemployment benefits, etc. This return effect is estimated at 40% of the direct public investment.\n\nThe energy administration detains estimations concerning the avoided CO emissions. They are based on the savings in terms of MWh.\n\nThe EEA measures put in place during the legislature allowed to save 590,000 tons of CO in 2014. This corresponds to an annual consumption of 50,000 households.\n\nAdding the tons of CO saved during the legislature, we get to a cumulative total of over 1.5 million tons of CO.\n\nFrom the calculation of saved MWh, the realized financial savings have been estimated at €215 million in 2014, and €556 million over the duration of the legislature.\n\nA study taking into account the amount of financed works, the impact on energy saving, and the lifetime of installations, estimated that in terms of purchasing power, the investment in housing isolation and performance allows households to realize economy savings of €2.5 billion over the lifetime of the equipment.\n\nIn 2010, the Brussels government decided to adopt a strategy similar to that of Wallonia, by setting up an Employment-Environment Alliance.\n\nThe first employment-environment alliance was defined around 4 axis:\n\n\nThe objective of the “Green construction” axis is to “\"stimulate and accompany the Brussels actors in the construction sector so that they develop a competitive offer in terms of green construction and renovation.\"”\n\nThe Agreement on the Sustainable Construction Axis gathered 50 private and public signatories. The process involves 130 organizations (52% public and 48% private). The actors in question elaborated 44 concrete actions aimed at answering challenges of teaching, training, insertion, technical references, research, support to companies, financing, labels... After the elaboration phase, the concrete engagements have been approved by the government, and the actors signed the Agreement text on February 25, 2011.\n\nThe EEA multiannual plan engages 44 partners who signed the multi-sectorial contracts.\n\nThe current actions and policies of the EEA provide for the creation of 10,100 jobs until 2020, with in particular 4,300 jobs in sustainable construction.\n\n\nWithin a follow-up committee, social partners involved in steering the sustainable construction axis identified three major contributions from the project:\n\n\nThe major idea underlying the Green Deal is the “pay as you save” principle, whereby a homeowner gets renovation works performed by a contractor, and then pays the costs according to the amount saved on its energy bill. Pilot programs took place from the 2008 up until mid-2011. When the \"Pay As You Save\" (PAYS) pilot ended, the government implemented the “\"Green Deal\"”, introducing various new measures: the “Golden Rule” (whereby repayments must not exceed energy savings), financing linked to the energy bill, obligation for the energy suppliers to adapt their billing system to collect repayments, and introduction of the “Energy Company Obligation” (ECO).\n\nThe first Green Deal policy was outlined in 2010 by the Conservative Party. The amount of the loans would be of up to £6,500. After a series of setbacks, a renewed Green Deal was launched on 28 January 2013, with mixed results.\n\nAt the time of creation, the Green Deal was praised as “revolutionary,” its initiators setting very high targets. The government expected that 14 million homes could benefit from it until 2020, that investments could reach £10 billion, and that 65,000 jobs could be created. However, in 2012, numbers in take-up rates were greatly disappointing, making the Green Deal look like it was “\"doomed to fail\".” The Green Deal principle relied on take-up by the market, which was greatly criticized for having “\"never worked anywhere in the world […] and unlikely to happen in the UK.\"\"\n\nIn April 2012, the Government considered obliging householders who are undertaking home improvements to spend an extra 10% of the cost on energy efficiency measures. The media portrayed it as a “conservatory tax” robbing householders and making any building project overly expensive. Ministers thus decided to abandon the idea.\n\nA new impetus given at the beginning of 2013 allowed the government to rescue the project. In July 2014, the DECC closed applications for the Green Deal Home Improvement Fund. The £120 million fund has been depleted by “overwhelming public demand”, triggering furious reactions by the sector, and displaying another setback for the Green Deal (but also promising take-up results).\n\nThe latest results published by the Government in July 2014 are as follows:\n\n"}
{"id": "41227580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41227580", "title": "Reactions to global surveillance disclosures", "text": "Reactions to global surveillance disclosures\n\nThe global surveillance disclosure released to media by Edward Snowden has caused tension in the bilateral relations of the United States with several of its allies and economic partners as well as in its relationship with the European Union. In August 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama announced the creation of \"a review group on intelligence and communications technologies\" that would brief and later report to him. In December, the task force issued 46 recommendations that, if adopted, would subject the National Security Agency (NSA) to additional scrutiny by the courts, Congress, and the president, and would strip the NSA of the authority to infiltrate American computer systems using \"backdoors\" in hardware or software. Geoffrey R. Stone, a White House panel member, said there was no evidence that the bulk collection of phone data had stopped any terror attacks.\n\nU.S. Army General Keith B. Alexander, then director of the NSA, said in June 2013, \"These leaks have caused significant and irreversible damage to our nation's security.\" He added that \"the irresponsible release of classified information about these programs will have a long-term detrimental impact on the intelligence community's ability to detect future attacks.\"\n\nIn June 2014, Alexander's recently installed successor as the NSA's director, U.S. Navy Admiral Michael S. Rogers, said that while some terrorist groups had altered their communications to avoid surveillance techniques revealed by Snowden, the damage done overall did not lead him to conclude that \"the sky is falling.\" Conceding there was no absolute protection against leaks by a dedicated insider with access to the agency's networks, Rogers said the NSA must nevertheless \"ensure that the volume\" of data taken by Snowden \"can't be stolen again.\"\n\nShortly after the disclosures were published, President Obama asserted that the American public had no cause for concern because \"nobody is listening to your telephone calls\", and \"there is no spying on Americans\".\n\nOn June 21, 2013, the Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper issued an apology for giving erroneous testimony under oath to the United States Congress. Earlier in March that year, Clapper was asked by Senator Ron Wyden to clarify the alleged surveillance of U.S. citizens by the NSA:\n\nIn an interview shortly after Snowden's disclosures were first published, Clapper stated that he had misunderstood Wyden's question and answered in what he thought was the \"least untruthful manner\". Later, in his letter of apology, Clapper wrote that he had only focused on Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act during his testimony to Congress, and therefore, he \"simply didn't think\" about Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which justifies the mass collection of telephone data from U.S. citizens. Clapper said: \"My response was clearly erroneous—for which I apologize\".\n\nTo increase transparency and because it is in the public interest the Director of National Intelligence authorized the declassification and public release of the following documents pertaining to the collection of telephone metadata pursuant to on July 31, 2013. These documents were:\n\nOn July 19, 2013, Human Rights Watch sent a letter to the Obama administration, urging it to allow companies involved in the NSA's surveillance to report about these activities and to increase government transparency.\n\nIn June 2013, British government officials issued a confidential DA-Notice to several press organizations, with the aim of restricting their ability to report on these leaks. That same month, the United States Army barred its personnel from access to parts of the website of \"The Guardian\" after that site's publication of Snowden's leaks. The entire \"Guardian\" website was blocked for personnel stationed throughout Afghanistan, the Middle East, and South Asia.\n\nAccording to a survey undertaken by the human rights group PEN International, these disclosures have had a chilling effect on American writers. Fearing the risk of being targeted by government surveillance, 28% of PEN's American members have curbed their usage of social media, and 16% have self-censored themselves by avoiding controversial topics in their writings.\n\nOn August 18, 2013, David Miranda, partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald, was detained for nine hours under Schedule 7 of the United Kingdom's Terrorism Act of 2000. Miranda was returning from Berlin, carrying 58,000 GCHQ documents on a single computer file to Greenwald in Brazil. Greenwald described Miranda's detention as \"clearly intended to send a message of intimidation to those of us who have been reporting on the NSA and GCHQ\". The Metropolitan Police and Home Secretary Theresa May called Miranda's detention \"legally and procedurally sound\". However, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, who helped introduce the bill in the House of Lords, said that under the act, police can only detain someone \"to assess whether they are involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism.\" He said, \"I am very clear that this does not apply, either on its terms or in its spirit, to Mr Miranda.\" Antonio Patriota the Brazilian Minister of External Relations said that Miranda's detention was \"not justifiable\". The reasons for Miranda's detention were sought from the police by British politicians and David Anderson Q.C., the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation. The United States government later said that British officials had given them a \"heads up\" about Miranda's detention, while adding that the decision to detain him had been a British one.\n\n\n\"The Guardian\" editor Alan Rusbridger said the newspaper had received legal threats from the British government and was urged to surrender all documents leaked by Snowden. Security officials from the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) later made a visit to the newspaper's London headquarters to ensure that all computer hard drives containing Snowden's documents were destroyed.\n\n\nAfter the NSA Director of Compliance John Delong was interviewed by \"The Washington Post\" regarding these disclosures, the White House sent a \"prepared\" statement to \"The Post\" and ordered that \"none of Delong's comments could be quoted on the record\". \"The Post\" refused to comply.\n\n\nA criminal investigation of these disclosures, by Britain's Metropolitan Police Service, was reported in November 2013.\n\nOn August 18, 2013, Amnesty International asserted that if journalists maintain their independence and report critically about governments, they too may be \"targeted\" by the British government.\n\nOn August 20, 2013, Index on Censorship argued that the British government's \"threat of legal action\" against \"The Guardian\" was a \"direct attack on press freedom in the UK\".\n\nOn September 4, 2013, U.N. Special Rapporteur Frank La Rue stressed that the \"protection of national security secrets must never be used as an excuse to intimidate the press into silence.\"\n\nFive Latin American countries—Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela—voiced their concerns to the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon after the plane of Bolivia's President Evo Morales was denied entry by a number of western European countries, and was forced to reroute to Austria based on \"suspicion that United States whistleblower Edward Snowden was on board\". Ban said it was important to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future and emphasized that \"A Head of State and his or her aircraft enjoy immunity and inviolability\".\n\nOn August 8, 2013, Lavabit, a Texas-based secure email service provider reportedly used by Snowden, abruptly announced it was shutting down operations after nearly 10 years of business. The owner, Ladar Levison, posted a statement online saying he would rather go out of business than \"become complicit in crimes against the American people.\" He also said that he was barred by law from disclosing what he had experienced over the preceding 6 weeks, and that he was appealing the case in the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Multiple sources speculated that the timing of the statement suggested that Lavabit had been targeted by the US government in its pursuit of information about Snowden. The following day, a similar email service, Silent Circle, preemptively shut down in order to \"prevent spying\". Snowden said about the Lavabit closure, \"Ladar Levison and his team suspended the operations of their 10-year-old business rather than violate the Constitutional rights of their roughly 400,000 users. The President, Congress, and the Courts have forgotten that the costs of bad policy are always borne by ordinary citizens, and it is our job to remind them that there are limits to what we will pay.\" He said that \"internet titans\" like Google should ask themselves why they weren't \"fighting for our interests the same way small businesses are.\"\n\nIn March 2014, \"The New York Times\" reported that revelations of NSA spying had cost U.S. tech companies, including Microsoft and IBM, over $1 billion. A senior analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said it was \"clear to every single tech company that this is affecting their bottom line,\" and predicted that the U.S. cloud computing industry could lose $35 billion by 2016. Forrester Research, an independent technology and market research company, said losses could be as high as $180 billion, or 25 percent of industry revenue.\n\nU.S. Army General Keith Alexander, then director of the NSA, said in June 2013, \"These leaks have caused significant and irreversible damage to our nation's security.\" He added that \"the irresponsible release of classified information about these programs will have a long-term detrimental impact on the intelligence community's ability to detect future attacks.\"\n\nIn August, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey said that Snowden \"has caused us some considerable damage to our intelligence architecture. Our adversaries are changing the way that they communicate.\"\n\nIn October, former GCHQ director Sir David Omand, speaking of how useful for Russia's intelligence services Snowden's stay in Russia could be, told the BBC: \"Part of me says that not even the KGB in its heyday of Philby, Burgess and Maclean in the 1950s could have dreamt of acquiring 58,000 highly classified intelligence documents.\" Snowden stated that he had not leaked any documents to Russia.\n\nAlso in October, Andrew Parker, director general of the UK Security Service, maintained that the exposing of intelligence techniques had given extremists the ability to evade the intelligence agencies; he said, \"It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists. It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will.\"\n\nThat same month, the \"Financial Times\" editorialized that security chiefs were \"right to be alarmed, knowing that terrorists can change their modus operandi in response to new information on their capabilities\" and there was \"no firm evidence that the intelligence agencies are using these new collection capabilities for malign ends.\"\n\nOn June 9, 2013, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper, referring to the surveillance activities lately reported in \"The Washington Post\" and \"The Guardian\", stressed the activities were lawful, conducted under authorities approved by the U.S. Congress, and that \"significant misimpressions\" had resulted from the articles published; he called the disclosures of \"intelligence community measures used to keep Americans safe\" \"reckless\". He condemned the leaks as having done \"huge, grave damage\" to the U.S. intelligence capabilities.\nThat same day, a We the People petition was launched via the whitehouse.gov website seeking \"a full, free and absolute pardon for any crimes [Snowden] has committed or may have committed related to blowing the whistle on secret NSA surveillance programs.\" The petition attained 100,000 signatures within two weeks, thus meeting the threshold and requiring an official response from the White House. The White House answered on July 28, 2015, declining to pardon Snowden. In a response written by Lisa Monaco, Obama's homeland security and terrorism advisor, the White House said Snowden's disclosures had severe consequences for national security and that he should come home to be judged by a jury of his peers.\n\nAlso in June 2013, the U.S. military blocked access to parts of \"The Guardian\" website related to government surveillance programs for thousands of defense personnel across the country, and to \"The Guardian\"s entire website for personnel stationed in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and South Asia. A spokesperson described the filtering as a routine \"network hygiene\" measure intended to mitigate unauthorized disclosures of classified information onto the Department of Defense's unclassified networks.\n\nIn August 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama said that he had called for a review of U.S. surveillance activities even before Snowden had begun revealing details of the NSA's operations. Obama announced that he was directing DNI Clapper \"to establish a review group on intelligence and communications technologies\" that would brief and later report to the president. In December, the task force issued 46 recommendations that, if adopted, would subject the NSA to additional scrutiny by the courts, Congress, and the president, and would strip the NSA of the authority to infiltrate American computer systems using \"backdoors\" in hardware or software. Panel member Geoffrey R. Stone said there was no evidence that the bulk collection of phone data had stopped any terror attacks.\n\nOn October 31, 2013, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stated that \"in some cases\" the NSA had \"reached too far\" in some of its surveillance activities, and promised that it would be stopped.\n\nIn January 2014, James Clapper gave public testimony to a session of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He asked that \"Snowden and his accomplices\" return the purloined NSA documents. When Clapper was asked whether the word \"accomplices\" referred to journalists, Clapper's spokesperson Shawn Turner responded, \"Director Clapper was referring to anyone who is assisting Edward Snowden to further threaten our national security through the unauthorized disclosure of stolen documents related to lawful foreign intelligence collection programs.\"\n\nAlso in January 2014, a review by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) concluded that the NSA's collection of every U.S. phone record on a daily basis violates the legal restrictions of the statute cited to authorize it. \"The Section 215 bulk telephone records program,\" PCLOB reported, \"lacks a viable legal foundation under Section 215 [of the Patriot Act], implicates constitutional concerns under the First and Fourth Amendments, raises serious threats to privacy and civil liberties as a policy matter, and has shown only limited value. As a result, the Board recommends that the government end the program.\" The White House rejected the findings, saying \"We simply disagree with the board's analysis on the legality of the program.\" A second PCLOB review, in July 2014, concluded that the NSA's surveillance program targeting foreigners overseas is lawful, under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, and effective but that certain elements push \"close to the line\" of being unconstitutional. The July report said that the Board was \"impressed with the rigor of the government’s efforts to ensure that it acquires only those communications it is authorized to collect, and that it targets only those persons it is authorized to target. Moreover, the government has taken seriously its obligations to establish and adhere to a detailed set of rules regarding how it handles U.S. person communications that it acquires under the program.\"\n\nReactions to the global surveillance disclosures among members of the U.S. Congress initially were largely negative. Speaker of the House John Boehner and senators Dianne Feinstein and Bill Nelson called Snowden a traitor, and several senators and representatives joined them in calling for Snowden's arrest and prosecution. Arizona Senator John McCain criticized politicians who voted in favor of the PATRIOT Act but were outraged by the NSA spying on phone calls by saying, \"We passed the Patriot Act. We passed specific provisions of the act that allowed for this program to take place, to be enacted in operation. Now, if members of Congress did not know what they were voting on, then I think that that's their responsibility a lot more than it is the government's.\"\n\nIn July 2013, the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations unanimously adopted an amendment by Senator Lindsey Graham to the \"Fiscal Year 2014 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill\" that would have sought sanctions against any country offering asylum to Snowden.\n\nAlso in July 2013, Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) and Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) proposed the \"Amash–Conyers Amendment\" to the National Defense Authorization Act. If passed, the amendment would have curtailed \"the ongoing dragnet collection and storage of the personal records of innocent Americans.\" The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 205–217. An analysis indicated that those who voted against the amendment received 122% more in campaign contributions from defense contractors than those who voted in favor.\n\nIn September 2013, Senators Mark Udall, Richard Blumenthal, Rand Paul and Ron Wyden introduced a \"sweeping surveillance reform\" proposal. Called the most comprehensive proposal to date, the \"Intelligence Oversight and Surveillance Reform Act\" seeks to end the bulk collection of communication records made legal in section 215 of the Patriot Act and to reign in other \"electronic eavesdropping programs\". Wyden told \"The Guardian\" the Snowden disclosures have \"caused a sea change in the way the public views the surveillance system\". The draft bill is a blend of 12 similar proposals as well as other legislative proposals.\n\nIn October 2013, Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, author of the Patriot Act, introduced a proposal to the House of Representatives called the USA Freedom Act to end the bulk collection of Americans' metadata and reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court. Senators introduced two different reform proposals. One, the USA Freedom Act (H.R. 3361/ S. 1599), would effectively halt “bulk” records collection under the USA Patriot Act, while it also would require a warrant to deliberately search for the e-mail and phone call content of Americans that is collected as part of a surveillance program targeting foreigners located overseas. Another proposal is the FISA Improvements Act that would preserve the program while strengthening privacy protections. It would also codifying the requirement that analysts have a “reasonable articulable suspicion” that a phone number is associated with terrorism to query the NSA phone records database; requiring that the FISA court promptly review each such determination; and limiting the retention period for phone records. Both proposals share the introduction of a special advocate to promote privacy interests before the FISA court.\n\nIn April 2014, \"The Washington Post\" reported that some federal judges holding low-level positions had been balking at sweeping requests by law enforcement for cellphone and other sensitive personal data. The \"Post\" called it \"a small but growing faction, including judges in Texas, Kansas, New York and Pennsylvania,\" and said the judges deemed the requests overly broad and at odds with basic constitutional rights. Although some rulings were overturned, said the \"Post,\" their decisions have shaped when and how investigators can seize information detailing the locations, communications and online histories of Americans. Albert Gidari Jr., a partner at Perkins Coie who represents technology and telecommunications companies, told the \"Post\" that these judges \"don't want to be the ones who approve an order that later becomes public and embarrassing…. Nobody likes to be characterized as a rubber stamp.\" According to the \"Post,\" some legal observers have called this \"the Magistrates' Revolt,\" which began several years ago; however, it gained power amid mounting public anger about government surveillance capabilities after the NSA disclosures.\n\nIn the wake of the NSA leaks, conservative public interest lawyer and Judicial Watch founder Larry Klayman filed a lawsuit claiming that the federal government had unlawfully collected metadata for his telephone calls and was harassing him (see \"Klayman v. Obama\"), and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against Director of National Intelligence James Clapper alleging that the NSA's phone records program was unconstitutional (see \"ACLU v. Clapper\"). Once the judge in each case had issued rulings seemingly at odds with one another, Gary Schmitt (former staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence) wrote in \"The Weekly Standard\", \"The two decisions have generated public confusion over the constitutionality of the NSA's data collection program—a kind of judicial 'he-said, she-said' standoff.\"\n\nLegislators in several states introduced bills based upon a model act, written by anti-surveillance activists, called the \"Fourth Amendment Protection Act\".\nThe bills seek to prohibit state governments from co-operating with the NSA in various ways: the Utah bill would prohibit provision of water to NSA facilities; the California bill would prohibit state universities from conducting research for the NSA;\nand the Kansas bill would require a search warrant for data collection.\n\nThe disclosures have inspired public protests.\n\nAfter the June 2013 release, a political movement known as \"Restore the Fourth\" was formed in the United States and rapidly gained momentum. In early July, \"Restore the Fourth\" was responsible for protests in more than 80 cities including Seattle, San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City. These protests were loosely coordinated via online messaging services and involved protestors from all over the United States.\n\nOn October 26, 2013, an anti-NSA rally called \"Stop Watching Us\" was held in Washington, D.C., billed by organizers as the \"largest rally yet to protest mass surveillance\". A diverse coalition of over 100 advocacy groups organized the event and attracted thousands of protesters calling for an end to mass surveillance. Speakers included former governor Gary Johnson and NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake.\n\n\"The Day We Fight Back\" is an ongoing protest against mass surveillance by the National Security Agency (NSA) scheduled for February 11, 2014. The 'day of action' primarily took the form of webpage banner-advertisements urging viewers to contact their lawmakers over issues surrounding cyber surveillance and a free Internet. By February 10, more than 5,700 websites and organizations had signed up to show support by featuring \"The Day We a Fight Back\" banner for 24 hours.\n\nAs February 11 drew to a close, \"The New York Times\" posted a blog titled \"The Day the Internet Didn't Fight Back,\" reporting that \"the protest on Tuesday barely registered. Wikipedia did not participate. Reddit … added an inconspicuous banner to its homepage. Sites like Tumblr, Mozilla and DuckDuckGo, which were listed as organizers, did not include the banner on their homepages. The eight major technology companies—Google, Microsoft, Facebook, AOL, Apple, Twitter, Yahoo and LinkedIn … only participated Tuesday insofar as having a joint website flash the protest banner.\"\nAn analysis released by the New America Foundation in January 2014 reviewed 225 terrorism cases since the September 11 attacks found that the NSA's bulk collection of phone records \"has had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism,\" and that U.S. government claims of the program's usefulness were \"overblown.\"\n\nOn June 17, 2013, nearly two weeks after the first disclosure was published, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a daily briefing, \"We believe the United States should pay attention to the international community's concerns and demands and give the international community the necessary explanation.\"\n\nThe \"South China Morning Post\" published a poll of Hong Kong residents conducted while Snowden was still in Hong Kong that showed that half of the 509 respondents believed the Chinese government should not surrender Snowden to the United States if Washington raises such a request; 33 percent of those polled think of Snowden as a hero, 12.8 percent described him as a traitor, 36 percent said he was neither.\n\nReferring to Snowden's presence in the territory, Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chun-Ying assured that the government would \"handle the case of Mr Snowden in accordance with the laws and established procedures of Hong Kong [and] follow up on any incidents related to the privacy or other rights of the institutions or people in Hong Kong being violated.\" Pan-democrat legislators Gary Fan and Claudia Mo said that the perceived U.S. prosecution against Snowden will set \"a dangerous precedent and will likely be used to justify similar actions\" by authoritarian governments.\nDuring Snowden's stay, the two main political groups, the pan-democrats and Pro-Beijing camp, found rare agreement to support Snowden. The pro-Beijing DAB party even organised a separate march to Government headquarters for Snowden.\n\nThe \"People's Daily\" and the \"Global Times\" editorials of June 19 stated respectively that the central Chinese government was unwilling to be involved in a \"mess\" caused by others, and that the Hong Kong government should follow the public opinion and not concern itself with Sino-US relations. A Tsinghua University communications studies specialist, Liu Jianming, interpreted that the two articles as suggesting that the mainland government did not want further involvement in the case and that the Hong Kong government should handle it independently.\n\nAfter Snowden left Hong Kong, Chinese-language newspapers such as the \"Ming Pao\" and the \"Oriental Daily\" expressed relief that Hong Kong no longer had to shoulder the burden of the Snowden situation. Mainland experts said that, although the Central Government did not want to appear to be intervening in the matter, it was inconceivable that the Hong Kong government acted independently in a matter that could have far-reaching consequences for Sino-US relations. One expert suggested that, by doing so, China had \"returned the favor\" for their not having accepted the asylum plea from Wang Lijun in February 2012. The official Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, the \"People's Daily\" denied the US government accusation that the PRC central government had allowed Snowden to escape, and said that Snowden helped in \"tearing off Washington's sanctimonious mask.\"\n\nOn November 2, 2013, the Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman summoned the ambassadors of Australia and the United States to protest an alleged American-led spying network in Asia.\n\nEarly in July 2013, the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmström, wrote to two U.S. officials that \"mutual trust and confidence have been seriously eroded and I expect the U.S. to do all that it can to restore them\".\n\nOn October 20, 2013, a committee at the European Parliament backed a measure that, if enacted, would require American companies to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States warrants seeking private data. The legislation has been under consideration for two years. The vote is part of efforts in Europe to shield citizens from online surveillance in the wake of revelations about a far-reaching spying program by NSA.\n\nThe European Council meeting at the end of October 2013 in its statement signed by all 28 EU leaders while stressing that \"intelligence gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism\" and noting \"the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership\", said that this must \"be based on respect and trust,\" a lack of which \"could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence gathering\".\n\nOn December 23, 2013, the European Parliament released the results of its inquiry into the NSA activities. \"The European Parliament's committee inquiry into the spying scandal,\" Deutsche Welle reported, \"was the first of this scale. No individual EU country has looked into the scandal this thoroughly and no EU government has been as explicit in its criticism of the US government.\" The draft report covered the preceding six months and was, said Deutsche Welle, \"hard on all sides—including governments and companies in the EU.\" Presented by Claude Moraes, British Member of the European Parliament from the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, the report found what it called \"compelling evidence of the existence of far-reaching, complex and highly technologically advanced systems designed by US and some Member States' intelligence services to collect, store and analyze communication and location data and metadata of all citizens around the world on an unprecedented scale and in an indiscriminate and non-suspicion-based manner.\" The fight against terrorism, said the report, can \"never in itself be a justification for untargeted, secret and sometimes even illegal mass surveillance programs.\" However, Moreas and his fellow rapporteurs considered it \"very doubtful that data collection of such magnitude is only guided by the fight against terrorism, as it involves the collection of all possible data of all citizens; points therefore to the possible existence of other power motives such as political and economic espionage.\"\n\nOn October 21, 2013, France summoned Charles Rivkin, the U.S. Ambassador to France, to clarify and explain the NSA's surveillance of French citizens. Speaking to journalists, President François Hollande said, \"We cannot accept this kind of behaviour between partners and allies. We ask that this immediately stop.\" According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", data allegedly collected by the NSA in France was actually collected by French intelligence agencies outside France and then shared with the United States.\n\nAccording to \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The outcry over NSA eavesdropping has been most pronounced in Germany, a country whose history of dictatorship has left the population particularly sensitive to violations of personal privacy.\" It was revealed that, beginning in 2002, German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone has been \"on an NSA target list\". It was reported that the NSA also spied on then-Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder starting in 2002 after the Schroeder criticized plans for the invasion of Iraq.\n\nOn July 1, 2013, the German Foreign Ministry summoned Philip D. Murphy, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, over allegations that the NSA had spied on institutions of the European Union.\n\nTowards the end of July, the media reported that Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), had been actively cooperating with the NSA, which sparked demonstrations in 40 German cities involving thousands of protesters all over the country.\n\nIn early August 2013, Germany canceled largely symbolic Cold War-era administrative agreements with Britain, the United States and France, which had granted the Western countries which had troops stationed in West Germany the right to request surveillance operations to protect those forces. At the end of August, under the orders of the German domestic intelligence agency, a federal police helicopter conducted a low-altitude flyover of the United States Consulate in Frankfurt, apparently in search of suspected clandestine eavesdropping facilities. A German official called it a symbolic \"shot across the bow.\"\n\nOn October 24, 2013, EU heads of state met to discuss a proposed data protection law. The representatives of Italy, Poland and France wanted the law to be passed before the May 2014 European Parliament elections. Germany, represented by Angela Merkel, and the UK, represented by David Cameron, favored a slower implementation; their wishes prevailed. About the \"Five Eyes\" espionage alliance, Merkel remarked, \"Unlike David, we are unfortunately not part of this group.\" Also on October 24, the Foreign Ministry summoned John B. Emerson, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, to clarify allegations that the NSA had tapped into Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.\n\nWhile the German government had hoped for a \"no spy\" agreement with the U.S., by January 2014 it was reported that Germany had \"given up hope\" of securing such a treaty. The Foreign Office's Philipp Mißfelder declared that \"the current situation in transatlantic relations is worse than it was at the low-point in 2003 during the Iraq War\".\n\nThe German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal was started on March 20, 2014, by the German Parliament in order to investigate the extent and background of foreign secret services spying in Germany and to search for strategies on how to protect German telecommunication with technical means.\n\nIt was revealed that Germany's BND intelligence service has covertly monitored European defence interests and politicians inside Germany at the request of the NSA.\n\nItaly's Prime Minister Enrico Letta asked John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, to clarify if the NSA had illegally intercepted telecommunications in Italy. On October 23, 2013, the Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano told reporters, \"We have a duty to [provide] clarity to Italian citizens—we must obtain the whole truth and tell the whole truth, without regard for anyone.\"\n\nOn October 25, 2013, the Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy summoned James Costos, the U.S. Ambassador to Spain, to clarify reports about the NSA's surveillance of the Spanish government. Spanish EU Minister Íñigo Méndez de Vigo said such practices, if true, were \"inappropriate and unacceptable\". An EU delegation was to meet officials in Washington to convey their concerns. According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", data allegedly collected by the NSA in Spain was actually collected by Spanish intelligence agencies outside Spain and then shared with the United States. On October 29, \"The Washington Post\" reported that an anonymous \"senior Obama administration official\" had also described such an arrangement with Spain.\n\nBritish Foreign Minister William Hague admitted that Britain's GCHQ was also spying and collaborating with the NSA, and defended the two agencies' actions as \"indispensable.\" Meanwhile, UK Defence officials issued a confidential DA-Notice to British media asking for restraint in running further stories related to surveillance leaks including the PRISM program and the British involvement therein. British Prime Minister David Cameron issued a veiled threat to resort to prior restraint, through high court injunctions and DA-Notices, if \"The Guardian\" did not obey his demands to stop reporting its revelations on spying by GCHQ and the NSA, a development that \"alarmed\" the Committee to Protect Journalists and spurred 70 of the world's leading human rights organizations to write an open letter to the newspaper expressing their concern about press and other freedoms in the UK.\n\nIn 2014 the Director of GCHQ authored an article in the \"Financial Times\" on the topic of internet surveillance, stating that \"however much [large US technology companies] may dislike it, they have become the command and control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals\" and that GCHQ and its sister agencies \"cannot tackle these challenges at scale without greater support from the private sector\", arguing that most internet users \"would be comfortable with a better and more sustainable relationship between the [intelligence] agencies and the tech companies\". Since the 2013 surveillance disclosures, large US technology companies have improved security and become less co-operative with foreign intelligence agencies, including those of the UK, generally requiring a US court order before disclosing data.\n\nOn October 24, 2013, the Mexican Foreign Minister José Antonio Meade Kuribreña met with U.S. Ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne to discuss allegations reported by \"Der Spiegel\" that the NSA hacked the emails of former president Felipe Calderón while in office.\n\nFormer Foreign Minister Bob Carr remarked that the U.S. would be critical of any other nation that failed to prevent the release of such sensitive documents. \"Certainly if it had gone the other way,\" said Carr, \"if there'd been some official in Canberra, some contractor in Canberra, who allowed a slew of material as sensitive as this to be plastered over the world's media, America would be saying very stern things to someone they'd be regarding as a woefully immature ally and partner.\"\n\nOn November 1, 2013, the Foreign Ministry of Indonesia summoned Australia's Ambassador Greg Moriarty to explain his country's surveillance of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and other Indonesian political leaders. On November 18, the Australian ambassador was summoned again by Indonesian government officials, who pledged to review all types of cooperation with Australia. The Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa called the spying \"unacceptable\", and added that \"This is an unfriendly, unbecoming act between strategic partners.\" The Indonesian ambassador to Australia was also recalled as a response to the incident.\n\nThe Brazilian government expressed outrage at the revelations that the National Security Agency directly targeted the communications of president Dilma Rousseff and her top aides. It called the incident an \"unacceptable violation of sovereignty\" and requested an immediate explanation from the U.S. government.\n\nBrazil's government signaled it would consider cancelling Rousseff's state visit to Washington—the only state visit for a foreign leader scheduled this year. A senior Brazilian official stated the country would downgrade commercial ties unless Rousseff receives a public apology. That would include ruling out the $4 billion purchase of Boeing F-18 Super Hornet fighters and cooperation on oil and biofuels technology, as well as other commercial agreements. Petrobras announced that it was investing R$21 billion over five years to improve its data security.\n\nEcuador responded by renouncing U.S. trade benefits and offering to pay a similar amount, $23 million per year, to finance human rights training in America to help avoid what Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patiño called \"violations of privacy, torture and other actions that are denigrating to humanity.\"\n\nRussia, South Africa, and Turkey reacted angrily after it was revealed that their diplomats had been spied on during the 2009 G-20 London summit.\n\nLondon-based Index on Censorship called upon the U.S. government to uphold the First Amendment, saying, \"The mass surveillance of citizens' private communications is unacceptable—it both invades privacy and threatens freedom of expression. The US government cannot use the excuse of national security to justify either surveillance on this scale or the extradition of Snowden for revealing it.\"\n\nIn July 2013, speaking to the foreign affairs committee of the Icelandic Parliament in Reykjavík, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that in his personal opinion, Edward Snowden had misused his right to digital access and created problems that outweigh the benefits of public disclosure. Birgitta Jónsdóttir, an Icelandic legislator who in 2010 assisted WikiLeaks in publishing U.S. state secrets leaked by Chelsea Manning, expressed alarm at Ban's remarks. She said that he \"seemed entirely unconcerned about the invasion of privacy by governments around the world, and only concerned about how whistleblowers are misusing the system.\"\n\nIn \"The Blacklist\" episode \"The Alchemist (No. 101)\" (season 1, episode 12, minutes 00:22:00-00:22:55), one of the technical experts Red tasked to reconstitute documents shredded by American governmental agencies reports: \"We actually reached out to the Germans for help. They're the ones who designed the software.\" Red replies: \"Ah, the Germans. Despite recent headlines, they're still the best at keeping an eye on their fellow man\".\n"}
{"id": "23591339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23591339", "title": "Renosterveld", "text": "Renosterveld\n\nRenosterveld is a term used for one of the major plant communities and vegetation types of the Cape Floristic Region (Cape Floral Kingdom) which is located in southwestern and southeastern South Africa, in southernmost Africa. It is an ecoregion of the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome.\n\nRenosterveld directly translated in the Afrikaans language means \"rhinoceros-field\", a possible reference to the high number of rhinoceroses seen by the Afrikaner settlers at the time. It may also derive its name from the renosterbos (\"rhinoceros bush - \"Elytropappus rhinocerotis\"), which is a common species of shrub found here. The dull grey colour of renosterbos is similar to the colour of a rhino's hide.\nRenosterveld plants grow on rich soil, which makes them more nutritious than typical fynbos plants. Typically, renosterveld is largely confined to fine-grained soils - mainly clays and silts - which are derived from the shales of the Malmesbury and Bokkeveld Groups and the Karoo Sequence. In drier regions it also occurs on Cape Granite Suite-derived soils.\n\nRenosterveld usually grows in areas that have moderate winter rainfall of 300–600 mm per year. It can survive relatively frequent fires.\n\nThis vegetation type is dominated by a species of grey-coloured plant called the renosterbos. However, the \"Proteas\", \"Ericas\" and \"Restios\" - typical of fynbos habitats, tend to occur in very low abundance in renosterveld. There are few endemics to renosterveld vegetation alone, many of the species occurring in fynbos as well. However, species endemic to the Cape Floristic Region comprise about one-third of renosterveld plant species, and many of these belong to families which are not considered to be of \"Cape affinity\" (i.e. these families are also diverse outside the Cape Floral Kingdom). \n\nThe original inhabitants of the Western Cape, the San and Khoi, used renosterveld plants for food, medicine and grazing. Because of their relatively small populations and simple lifestyles, they did not cause a great deal of damage to this ecosystem.\n\nMany renosterveld trees and shrubs produce berries, which attract fruit-eating birds (e.g. bulbuls, Cape white-eyes) and other animals (e.g. geometric tortoises, chacma baboons). \n\nDuring spring, renosterveld flowers attract a wide variety of pollinators, like bees, flies, beetles and sunbirds.\n\nBecause of its high soil fertility, it is probable that all the herds of large game in the fynbos biome occurred in renosterveld. Thus mountain zebra, quagga, bluebuck, roan antelope, red hartebeest, eland, bontebok, elephant, black rhino and Cape buffalo were common, as were lion, cheetah, African wild dog, spotted hyena and leopard. \n\nTwo of these only ever occurred within the fynbos biome: bluebuck and bontebok. Of these large mammals, only the mountain zebra and leopard survived (by fleeing to the mountains), with the bontebok just surviving near Bredasdorp. All the other species became extinct in the fynbos biome (a tiny relict elephant population still survives in the area around the Gouritz River and surrounding areas within the fynbos biome area), although many have been introduced into conservation areas from outside the region. The quagga and bluebuck are extinct, although there is a project (the Quagga Project) to restore plains zebras with quagga-like markings.\n\nThe high fertility of renosterveld soils has meant that most of the area has been converted to agriculture, mainly wheat. \n\nIt is alleged that the high shrub cover is a result of continuous grazing. Early records suggest that the renosterveld had abundant grasses, and that the game and Khoi cattle migrated over the region. With the establishment of European stock farmers, continuous grazing and the elimination of the diverse grazing-browsing fauna, the shrubby element was promoted. This theory is not universally accepted, but proponents argue to the sudden decline of hay near Cape Town in the early 18th century, and the many historical records of early explorers claiming that renosterbos was taking over and that grass was becoming scarce. \n\nIn the Cape Floristic Region, less than 2% of renosterveld vegetation types are formally conserved. These are some of the most threatened types of vegetation in the world.\n\nIt seems unlikely that viable populations of large mammals will ever be reintroduced into the fynbos biome for this reason.\n\nConservation organisations and volunteers are working with farmers and municipalities to identify, map and protect the remaining precious areas of renosterveld in the Western Cape.

{"id": "4297420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4297420", "title": "Respiratory quotient", "text": "Respiratory quotient\n\nThe respiratory quotient (or RQ or respiratory coefficient), is a dimensionless number used in calculations of basal metabolic rate (BMR) when estimated from carbon dioxide production. It is calculated from the ratio of carbon dioxide produced by the body to oxygen consumed by the body. Such measurements, like measurements of oxygen uptake, are forms of indirect calorimetry. It is measured using a respirometer. The Respiratory Quotient value indicates which macronutrients are being metabolized, as different energy pathways are used for fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. A value of 0.7 indicates that lipids are being metabolized, 0.8 for proteins, and 1.0 for carbohydrates. The approximate respiratory quotient of a mixed diet is 0.8. Some of the other factors that may affect the respiratory quotient are energy balance, circulating insulin, and insulin sensitivity.\n\nIt can be used in the alveolar gas equation.\n\nThe respiratory quotient (RQ) is the ratio:\n\nRQ = CO / O\n\nwhere the term \"eliminated\" refers to carbon dioxide (CO) removed from the body.\n\nIn this calculation, the CO and O must be given in the same units, and in quantities proportional to the number of molecules. Acceptable inputs would be either moles, or else volumes of gas at standard temperature and pressure.\n\nMany metabolized substances are compounds containing only the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Examples include fatty acids, glycerol, carbohydrates, deamination products, and ethanol. For complete oxidation of such compounds, the chemical equation is\n\nCHO + (x + y/4 - z/2) O \n→ x CO + (y/2) HO\n\nand thus metabolism of this compound gives an RQ of x/(x + y/4 - z/2).\n\nFor glucose, with the molecular formula, CHO, the complete oxidation equation is CHO + 6 O \n→ 6 CO+ 6 HO. Thus, the RQ= 6 CO/ 6 O=1.\n\nThe range of respiratory coefficients for organisms in metabolic balance usually ranges from 1.0 (representing the value expected for pure carbohydrate oxidation) to ~0.7 (the value expected for pure fat oxidation). In general, molecules that are more oxidized (e.g., glucose) require less oxygen to be fully metabolized and, therefore, have higher respiratory quotients. Conversely, molecules that are less oxidized (e.g., fatty acids) require more oxygen for their complete metabolism and have lower respiratory quotients. See BMR for a discussion of how these numbers are derived. A mixed diet of fat and carbohydrate results in an average value between these numbers.\n\nRQ value corresponds to a caloric value for each liter (L) of CO produced. If O consumption numbers are available, they are usually used directly, since they are more direct and reliable estimates of energy production.\n\nRQ as measured includes a contribution from the energy produced from protein. However, due to the complexity of the various ways in which different amino acids can be metabolized, no single RQ can be assigned to the oxidation of protein in the diet.\n\nInsulin, which increases lipid storage and decreases fat oxidation, is positively associated with increases in the respiratory quotient. A positive energy balance will also lead to an increased respiratory quotient.\n\nPractical applications of the respiratory quotient can be found in severe cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in which patients spend a significant amount of energy on respiratory effort. By increasing the proportion of fats in the diet, the respiratory quotient is driven down, causing a relative decrease in the amount of CO produced. This reduces the respiratory burden to eliminate CO, thereby reducing the amount of energy spent on respirations.\n\nRespiratory Quotient can be used as an indicator of over or underfeeding. Underfeeding, which forces the body to utilize fat stores, will lower the respiratory quotient, while overfeeding, which causes lipogenesis, will increase it. Underfeeding is marked by a respiratory quotient below 0.85, while a respiratory quotient greater than 1.0 indicates overfeeding. This is particularly important in patients with compromised respiratory systems, as an increased respiratory quotient significantly corresponds to increased respiratory rate and decreased tidal volume, placing compromised patients at a significant risk.\n\nBecause of its role in metabolism, respiratory quotient can be used in analysis of liver function and diagnosis of liver disease. In patients suffering from liver cirrhosis, non-protein respiratory quotient (npRQ) values act as good indicators in the prediction of overall survival rate. Patients having a npRQ < 0.85 show considerably lower survival rates as compared to patients with a npRQ > 0.85. A decrease in npRQ corresponds to a decrease in glycogen storage by the liver. Similar research indicates that non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases are also accompanied by a low respiratory quotient value, and the non protein respiratory quotient value was a good indication of disease severity.\n\nRespiratory Exchange Ratio\n"}

It is not known what species it was, but a scholar has suggested that it was a yew tree.\n\nIt is even more sparsely documented than the famous temple by which it stood. In the 1070s, the writer of a scholium in Adam of Bremen's \"Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum\" explained: \n\nNear that temple is a very large tree with widespread branches which are always green both in winter and summer. What kind of tree it is nobody knows. There is also a spring there where the pagan are accustomed to perform sacrifices and to immerse a human being alive. As long as his body is not found, the request of the people will be fulfilled.\n\nThe description of the tree and the location of a well nearby are reminiscent of the evergreen, Yggdrasil, which stood above the Well of Urd, and it is possible that the Swedes consciously had created a copy of the world of their Norse gods at Uppsala.\n\nThe later Icelandic source, \"Hervarar saga\", contains a description of how the tree was used in the pagan rites, concerning an event taking place only a few years after the scholium was written. It is in reference to the ancient Indo-European ritual of horse sacrifice:\n\nSvein, the King's brother-in-law, remained behind in the assembly, and offered the Swedes to do sacrifices on their behalf if they would give him the Kingdom. They all agreed to accept Svein's offer, and he was then recognized as King over all Sweden. A horse was then brought to the assembly and hewn in pieces and cut up for eating, and the sacred tree was smeared with blood. Then all the Swedes abandoned Christianity, and sacrifices started again. They drove King Ingi away; and he went into Västergötland.\n"}
{"id": "22785326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22785326", "title": "Stewart Island", "text": "Stewart Island\n\nStewart Island/Rakiura (commonly called Stewart Island) is the third-largest island of New Zealand. It lies south of the South Island, across the Foveaux Strait. Its permanent population is 381 people as of the 2013 census, most of whom live in the settlement of Oban on the eastern side of the island.\n\nThe original Māori name, \"Te Punga o Te Waka a Maui\", positions Stewart Island/Rakiura firmly at the heart of Māori mythology. Translated as \"The Anchor Stone of Maui’s Canoe\", it refers to the part played by the island in the legend of Maui and his crew, who from their canoe, the South Island, caught and raised the great fish, the North Island.\n\nRakiura is the more commonly known and used Māori name. It is usually translated as \"Glowing Skies\", possibly a reference to the sunsets for which it is famous or for the aurora australis, the southern lights that are a phenomenon of southern latitudes.\n\nFor some, Rakiura is the abbreviated version of Te Rakiura a Te Rakitamau, translated as \"great blush of Rakitamau\", in reference to the latter's embarrassment when refused the hand in marriage of not one, but two daughters, of an island chief. According to Māori legend, a chief on the island named Te Rakitamau was married to a young woman who became terminally ill and implored him to marry her cousin after she died. Te Rakitamau paddled across Te Moana Tapokopoko a Tawhiki (Foveaux Strait) to the South Island where the cousin lived, only to discover she had recently married. He blushed with embarrassment; so the island was called Te Ura o Te Rakitamau.\n\nCaptain James Cook and his crew were the first Europeans to sight the island from the \"Endeavour\" in March 1770. As the ship sailed south around it, Cook recorded its insularity and described the strait that separates it from South Island. But a few weeks later, he changed his mind. He was operating during the period of intense Anglo-French rivalry that filled the twelve years between Britain's success in the Seven Years' War and France's revanche in the American Revolutionary War . He recalled the Admiralty's verbal instructions to conceal strategically important discoveries that could become security risks, such as off-shore islands from which operations could be mounted by a hostile power. Cook knew he had to hide Foveaux Strait and depict Stewart Island as a peninsula. Consequently, he altered his journal entry and redrew his chart of New Zealand showing the two southerly islands joined by an isthmus.\n\nThe island received its English name in honour of William W. Stewart, who was first officer on the ship \"Pegasus\", which visited from Port Jackson (Sydney), Australia, in 1809 on a sealing expedition. Stewart charted the large southeastern harbour that now bears the ship's name (Port Pegasus), and determined the northern points of the island, proving that it was an island. He made three further visits to the island from the 1820s to the 1840s.\n\nIn 1841, the island was established as one of the three Provinces of New Zealand, and was named New Leinster. However, the province existed on paper only and was abolished after only five years, and with the passing of the New Zealand Constitution Act 1846 the province became part of New Munster, which entirely included the South Island. When New Munster was abolished in 1853, Stewart Island became part of Otago Province until 1861 when Southland Province split from Otago. In 1876 the provinces were abolished altogether.\n\nFor most of the twentieth century, \"Stewart Island\" was the official name, and that is still in common use by most New Zealanders. The name was officially altered to Stewart Island/Rakiura by the \"Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998\", one of many such changes under the Ngāi Tahu treaty settlement.\n\nStewart Island has an area of . Its terrain is hilly and, like most of New Zealand, Stewart Island has an Oceanic climate. The north is dominated by the swampy valley of the Freshwater River. The river rises close to the northwestern coast and flows southeastwards into the large indentation of Paterson Inlet. The highest peak is Mount Anglem (), close to the northern coast. It is one of a rim of ridges that surround Freshwater Valley.\n\nThe southern half is more uniformly undulating, rising to a ridge that runs south from the valley of the Rakeahua River, which also flows into Paterson Inlet. The southernmost point in this ridge is Mount Allen, at . In the southeast the land is somewhat lower, and is drained by the valleys of the Toitoi River, Lords River, and Heron River. South West Cape on this island is the southernmost point of the main islands of New Zealand.\n\nMason Bay, on the west side, is notable as a long sandy beach on an island where beaches are typically far more rugged. One suggestion is that the bay was formed in the aftershock of a meteorite impact in the Tasman Sea.\n\nThree large and many small islands lie around the coast. Notable among these are Ruapuke Island, in Foveaux Strait northeast of Oban; Codfish Island, close to the northwest shore; and Big South Cape Island, off the southwestern tip. The Titi/Muttonbird Islands group is between Stewart Island/Rakiura and Ruapuke Island, around Big South Cape Island, and off the southeastern coast. Other islands of interest include Bench Island, Native Island, and Ulva Island, all close to the mouth of Paterson Inlet, and Pearl Island, Anchorage Island, and Noble Island, close to Port Pegasus in the southwest. Further offshore The Snares are oceanic islands, a volcano and some smaller islets, that were never connected to the larger Stewart Island.\n\nThe climate of Stewart Island is mild for temperatures. However, one travel guide mentions \"frequent downpours that make 'boots and waterproof clothing mandatory'\", and another guide says that rainfall in Oban, the capital, is a year.\n\nOwing to an anomaly in the magnetic latitude contours, this location is well placed for observing Aurora australis.\n\nThe only town is Oban, on Halfmoon Bay.\n\nA previous settlement, Port Pegasus, once boasted several stores and a post office, and was located on the southern coast of the island. It is now uninhabited, and is accessible only by boat or by an arduous hike through the island. Another site of former settlement is at Port William, a four-hour walk around the north coast from Oban, where immigrants from the Shetland Islands settled in the early 1870s. This was unsuccessful, and the settlers left within one to two years, most for sawmilling villages elsewhere on the island.\n\nSince 1988 the electricity supply on Stewart Island/Rakiura has come from diesel generators; previously residents used their own private generators. As a consequence electric power is around three times more expensive than in the South Island, at NZ$0.59/kWh in 2016. The Southland District Council has partnered with Meridian Energy to develop renewable energy sources for the island, and experiments with photovoltaic and wind generation are in progress.\n\nFishing has been, historically, the most important element of the economy of Stewart Island/Rakiura, and while it remains important, tourism has become the main source of income for islanders. There has also been some farming and forestry. Oban has mainly sealed main roads, and some gravel roads on the outskirts.\n\nStewart Island Flights links Ryan's Creek Aerodrome and Invercargill Airport and aircraft also land on the sand at Mason Bay, Doughboy Bay, and West Ruggedy Beach. A regular passenger ferry service runs between Bluff and Oban. The only ferry/barge link to the South Island for vehicles is to Bluff.\n\nOban has phone and broadband (ADSL) services. Cellphone coverage is provided by Spark and Vodafone. All these services rely on a radio link to Bluff, so broadband speeds are limited.\n\nStewart Island is able to receive most AM and FM radio stations broadcast in the Southland region. Television services are available via satellite using Sky or Freeview. Analogue terrestrial television services could be received on Stewart Island from the Hedgehope television transmitter located in the South Island prior to the analogue switch off on April 28, 2013.\n\nFrom 1841 to 1853, Stewart Island was governed as New Leinster Province, then as part of New Munster Province. From 1853 onwards, it was part of the Otago Province. In local government today, Stewart Island/Rakiura is part of the Southland District and the Southland Region. However, it shares with some other islands a certain relaxation in some of the rules governing commercial activities. For example, every transport service operated solely on Great Barrier Island, the Chatham Islands, or Stewart Island/Rakiura is exempt from the Transport Act of 1962.\n\nAlthough the clay soil is not very fertile, the high rainfall and warm weather mean that the island is densely forested throughout. Native plants include the world's southernmost dense forest of podocarps (southern conifers) and hardwoods such as rātā and kāmahi in the lowland areas with mānuka shrubland at higher elevations. The trees are thought to have become established here since the last ice age from seeds brought across the strait by seabirds, which would explain why the beech trees that are so common in New Zealand, but whose seeds are dispersed by the wind rather than birds, are not found on Stewart Island.\n\nNoeline Baker purchased land near Halfmoon Bay in the early 1930s, and with a checklist by botanist Leonard Cockayne populated it with all the local indigenous plants. She gifted the land and her house to the government in 1940, and today Moturau Moana is New Zealand's southernmost public garden.\n\nThere are many species of birds on Stewart Island/Rakiura that have been able to continue to thrive because of the relative absence of the cats, rats, stoats, ferrets, weasels and other predators that humans brought to the main islands. There are even more species of birds, including huge colonies of sooty shearwater and other seabirds, on The Snares and the other smaller islands offshore. The birds of Stewart Island include weka, kākā, albatross, the flightless Stewart Island kiwi, silvereyes, fantails, and kererū. The endangered yellow-eyed penguin has a significant number of breeding sites here while the large colonies of sooty shearwaters on the offshore Muttonbird Islands, are subject to muttonbirding, a sustainable harvesting program managed by Rakiura Māori. Meanwhile, a small population of the kakapo, a flightless parrot which is very close to extinction, was found on Stewart Island in 1977 and the birds subsequently moved to smaller islands (Codfish Island) for protection from feral cats. The South Island saddleback is similarly preserved.\n\nAs the island has always been sparsely populated and there has never been very much logging, much of the original wildlife is intact, including species that have been devastated on the larger islands to the north since their habitation by humans. However, although habitats and wildlife were not threatened by invasive species historically, now there are populations of cats, rats and brushtail possums on the island, as well as a large population of white-tailed deer, which are hunted for meat and sport, introduced to coastal areas. There is also a small population of red deer confined to the inland areas. Almost all the island is owned by the New Zealand government and over 80 per cent of the island is set aside as the Rakiura National Park, New Zealand's newest national park. Many of the small offshore islands, including the Snares, are also protected.\n\nResidents of Stewart Island/Rakiura have held a number of promotional fundraising mock events regarding a declaration of independence for the island and to have it renamed to its original name of \"Rakiura\".\n\nIn the late 1950s or early 1960s they had a local printer overprint “INDEPENDENT RAKIURA” on eight values of some earlier New Zealand postage and health stamps. There were also eight different values from one penny to £1 overprinted on these stamps as well as having their original values blotted out with small black circles. These were sold to collectors with the proceeds helping to refurbish the Rakiura Museum.\n\nThere was another fundraising effort to raise NZ$6,000 for a new swimming pool for the island's school, by selling 50-cent passports for the newly \"independent\" island. A mock ceremony featured a declaration of independence on 31 July 1970 when the new republic's flag was unveiled.\n\nThese efforts were not serious attempts for independence, and Stewart Island/Rakiura remains a part of the New Zealand state.\n\n\n"}

The two-photon photovoltaic effect can be considered as the nonlinear equivalent of the conventional photovoltaic effect commonly used in p-n junction solar cells. The effect was first discovered in silicon and later observed in gallium arsenide and has potential in achieving energy-efficient electronic-photonic integrated circuits.\n"}
