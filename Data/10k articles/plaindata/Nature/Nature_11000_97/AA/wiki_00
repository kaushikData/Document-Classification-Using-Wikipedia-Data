Buddhist texts term the tree as Bodhi tree, a tree under which Gautam Buddha meditated and gained enlightenment.\n\nAshvattha is a name of Shiva and Vishnu; according to Sankara this name is derived from the terms, shva (tomorrow) and stha (that which remains). The Atharvan were the recipients of gifts (given to Payu) in the Danastuti from Prince Ashvattha’s generosity (Rig Veda mantra IV.47.24); the prince identified with Divodasa by Griffith.\n\nYama while instructing Naciketa describes the eternal Asvattha tree with its root upwards and branches downwards, which is the pure immortal Brahman, in which all these worlds are situated, and beyond which there is nothing else (Katha Upanishad Verse II.vi.1). But Krishna tells us that the Asvattha tree having neither end nor beginning nor stationariness whatsoever has its roots upwards and branches downwards whose branches are nourished by the Gunas and whose infinite roots spread in the form of action in the human world which though strong are to be cut off by the forceful weapon of detachment to seek the celestial abode from which there is no return (Bhagavata Gita Chapter XV Verses 1-4). The former teaches that the Asvattha tree is real being identical with Brahman and therefore impossible to cut-off; the latter insists that the Asvattha tree must be regarded as unreal being identical with existence which needs to be cut-off. \n\nThe Puranas such as the Padma Purana and the Skanda Purana enumerate the very many advantages to be secured from reverentially approaching and worshipping the Ashvattha (Peepul) tree.\n\nThe first historical person named in connection with the worship of the Bodhi tree in Bodhgaya is Asoka whose Buddhist name was Piyadasi.\n\nThe fire sticks used in Hindu sacrificial fire like agnihotra also contain dried wood of ashvatha tree.\n\n\n"}

According to the hypothesis, because of the rotation of the earth, erosion occurs mostly on the right banks of rivers in the Northern Hemisphere, and in the Southern Hemisphere on the left banks.\n\nThe concept was originally introduced by a French physicist Jacques Babinet in 1859 using mathematical deduction and Coriolis force. A more definitive explanation was given by an Estonian scientist Karl Ernst von Baer in 1860.\n\nAlthough it is possible that an aggregate measurement of all rivers would lead to a correlation with the Baer–Babinet law, the Coriolis force is orders of magnitude weaker than the local forces on the river channel from its flow. Therefore, this is unlikely to be important in any given river. Albert Einstein wrote a paper in 1926 explaining the true causes of the phenomenon (see tea leaf paradox).\n\n\n"}

It is generated by the friction of the water moving over the surface of the substrate. The thickness of this zone is determined by many factors including the Coriolis force.\n\nThe zone is of interest to biologist, geologists, sedimentologists, oceanographers, physicists and engineers as well as many other scientific disciplines. It is the area of interaction between the two environments and as such is important in many species' reproductive strategies, particularly larvae dispersal. The benthic boundary layer also contains nutrients important in fisheries, a wide array of microscopic life, a variety of suspended materials, and sharp energy gradients. It is also the sink for many anthropogenic substances released into the environment.\n\nThe benthic boundary layer (BBL) represents a few tens of meters of the water column directly above the sea floor and constitutes an important zone of biological activity in the ocean. It plays a vital role in the cycling of matter, and has been called the “endpoint” for sedimenting material, which fuels high metabolic rates for microbial populations. After passing through the BBL, this degraded material is either returned to the water column or mobilized into the sediment, where it may eventually become immobilized. With growing concern over the ultimate fate of matter in the ocean, knowledge of the complex biological processes in the deep sea BBL (deep-BBL) and how they affect future sedimentation and remineralization rates is valuable.\n\nIn the deep sea (1800 m depth or greater), the BBL is noted as having a near homogenous temperature and salinity with periodic fluxes of detrital or particulate organic matter (POM). This POM is strongly linked to seasonal variations in surface productivity and hydrodynamic conditions. Excluding hydrothermal vents, much of the deep sea benthos is allochthonous, and the importance of bacteria for substrate conversion is paramount.\n\nWhile the supply of POM, or marine snow, is relatively limited and inhibits species abundance, it sustains a complex yet understudied microbial loop that can maintain both meiofaunal and macrofaunal populations. In a study by Will Ritzrau (1996), it was determined that microbial activities were up to a factor of 7.5 higher in the BBL than in adjacent waters. While this study was completed between 100-400m depth, it could have implications for the deep-BBL. Presently, it is known that deep-BBL bacterial populations are able to support protozoan bacterivores like foraminifera and some metazoan zooplankton, which in turn can support larger organisms. Meiofauna and macrofauna found in the deep-BBL include: copepods, annelids, nematodes, bivalves, ostracods, isopods, amphipods, arthropods and gastropods, to name a few. These organisms ultimately play a vital role in the remineralization of matter and aid in breaking down POM that may eventually become permanent sediment.\n\nAs the effects of anthropogenic forcing begin taking an even greater toll on marine processes, long-term studies are essential in determining the health and stability of the deep-BBL. Currently, several groups are employing cabled observatories (ALOHA Cabled Observatory, Monterey Accelerated Research System, NEPTUNE, VENUS, and Liquid Jungle Lab (LJL) Panama- PLUTO) to work towards developing these much needed time-series.\n\n"}

{"id": "19163673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19163673", "title": "Cartographic generalization", "text": "Cartographic generalization\n\nCartographic generalization, or map generalization, is a method for deriving a smaller-scale map from a larger scale map or map data. Whether done manually by a cartographer or by a computer or set of algorithms, generalization seeks to abstract spatial information at a high level of detail to information that can be rendered on a map at a lower level of detail. For example, we might have the outlines of all of the thousands of buildings in a region, but we wish to make a map of the whole city no more than a few inches wide. Instead of throwing out the building information, or trying to render it all at once, we could generalize the data into some sort of outline of the urbanized area of the region.\n\nThe cartographer has license to adjust the content within their maps to create a suitable and useful map that conveys spatial information, while striking the right balance between the map's purpose and the precise detail of the subject being mapped. Well generalized maps are those that emphasize the most important map elements while still representing the world in the most faithful and recognizable way.\n\nThere are many cartographic techniques that may fall into the broad category of generalization. Here are brief descriptions of some of the more common methods:\n\nMap generalization is designed to reduce the complexities of the real world by strategically reducing ancillary and unnecessary details. One way that geospatial data can be reduced is through the selection process. The cartographer can select and retain certain elements that he/she deems the most necessary or appropriate. In this method, the most important elements stand out while lesser elements are left out entirely. For example, a directional map between two points may have lesser and un-traveled roadways omitted as not to confuse the map-reader. The selection of the most direct and uncomplicated route between the two points is the most important data, and the cartographer may choose to emphasize this.\n\nGeneralization is not a process that only removes and selects data, but also a process that simplifies or abstracts it as well. Simplification is a technique where the general shapes of features are retained, while eliminating unnecessary detail. Generally, smaller scale maps have more simplified features than larger scale maps. The Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm is one of the earliest and still most common techniques for line simplification.\n\nSimplification can be achieved in different ways: by eliminating parts of and giving an area a more familiar shape, by removing unimportant points off a shape - usually performed by a software, by eliminating small features such as islands, or by smoothing \"rough\" features such as straightening curvy lines to highlight their trend.\n\nSimplification also takes on other roles when considering the role of combination. Overall data reduction techniques can also mean that in addition to generalizing elements of particular features, features can also be combined when their separation is irrelevant to the map focus. A mountain chain may be isolated into several smaller ridges and peaks with intermittent forest in the natural environment, but shown as a continuous chain on the map, as determined by scale. The map reader has to, again remember, that because of scale limitations combined elements are not concise depictions of natural or manmade features.\n\nSmoothing is also a process that the map maker can employ to reduce the angularity of line work. Smoothing is yet another way of simplifying the map features, but involves several other characteristics of generalization that lead into feature displacement and locational shifting. The purpose of smoothing is to exhibit linework in a much less complicated and a less visually jarring way. An example of smoothing would be for a jagged roadway, cut through a mountain, to be smoothed out so that the angular turns and transitions appear much more fluid and natural.\n\nEnhancement is also a method that can be employed by the cartographer to illuminate specific elements that aid in map reading. As many of the aforementioned generalizing methods focus on the reduction and omission of detail, the enhancement method concentrates on the addition of detail. Enhancement can be used to show the true character of the feature being represented and is often used by the cartographer to highlight specific details about his or her specific knowledge, that would otherwise be left out. An example includes enhancing the detail about specific river rapids so that the map reader may know the facets of traversing the most difficult sections beforehand. Enhancement can be a valuable tool in aiding the map reader to elements that carry significant weight to the map’s intent.\n\nDisplacement can be employed when 2 objects are so close to each other that they would overlap at smaller scales. A common place where this would occur is the cities Brazzaville and Kinshasa on either side of the Congo river in Africa. They are both the capital city of their country and on overview maps they would be displayed with a slightly larger symbol than other cities. Depending on the scale of the map the symbols would overlap. By displacing both of them away from the river (and away from their true location) the symbol overlap can be avoided. Another common case is when a road and a railroad run parallel to each other. this is mostly adopted using the azimuthal projection method.\n\nExaggeration is the selection of map symbols that make features appear larger than they really are to make them more visible, recognizable, or higher in the visual hierarchy. For example, in a small-scale map, highways, rivers, and railroads may be drawn as thick lines that would be miles wide if measured according to the scale. Exaggeration often necessitates a subsequent displacement operation because wide lines representing features located near each other will overlap.\n\nAggregation is the merger of multiple features into a new composite feature. The new feature is of a type different than the original individuals, because it conceptualizes the group. For example, a multitude of buildings can be turned into a single region representing an \"urban area.\"\n\nAs GIS developed from about the late 1960s onward, the need for automatic, algorithmic generalization techniques became clear. Ideally, agencies responsible for collecting and maintaining spatial data should try to keep only one canonical representation of a given feature, at the highest possible level of detail. That way there is only one record to update when that feature changes in the real world. From this large-scale data, it should ideally be possible, through automated generalization, to produce maps and other data products at any scale required. The alternative is to maintain separate databases each at the scale required for a given set of mapping projects, each of which requires attention when something changes in the real world.\n\nSeveral broad approaches to generalization were developed around this time:\n\n\nThere are far more small geographic features than large ones in the Earth's surface, or far more small things than large ones in maps. This notion of far more small things than large ones is also called spatial heterogeneity, which has been formulated as scaling law. Cartographic generalization or any mapping practices in general is essentially to retain the underlying scaling of numerous smallest, a very few largest, and some in between the smallest and largest. This mapping process can be efficiently and effectively achieved by head/tail breaks, a new classification scheme or visualization tool for data with a heavy tailed distribution. Scaling law is likely to replace Töpfer's radical law to be a universal law for various mapping practices. What underlies scaling law is something of paradigm shift from Euclidean geometry to fractal, from non-recursive thinking to recursive thinking.\n\nThe Baltimore Phenomenon is the tendency for a city (or other object) to be omitted from maps due to space constraints while smaller cities are included on the same map simply because space is available to display them. This phenomenon owes its name to the city of Baltimore, Maryland, which tends to be omitted on maps due to the presence of larger cities in close proximity within the Mid-Atlantic United States. As larger cities near Baltimore appear on maps, smaller and lesser known cities may also appear at the same scale simply because there is enough space for them on the map.\n\nAlthough the Baltimore Phenomenon occurs more frequently on automated mapping sites, it does not occur at every scale. Popular mapping sites like Google Maps, Bing Maps, OpenStreetMap, and Yahoo Maps will only begin displaying Baltimore at certain zoom levels: 5th, 6th, 7th, etc.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19638930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19638930", "title": "Celtic sacred trees", "text": "Celtic sacred trees\n\nMany types of trees found in the Celtic nations are considered to be sacred, whether as symbols, or due to medicinal properties, or because they are seen as the abode of particular nature spirits. Historically and in folklore, the respect given to trees varies in different parts of the Celtic world. On the Isle of Man, the phrase 'fairy tree' often refers to the elder tree. The medieval Welsh poem \"Cad Goddeu (The Battle of the Trees)\" is believed to contain Celtic tree lore, possibly relating to the \"crann ogham\", the branch of the ogham alphabet where tree names are used as mnemonic devices. \nThe oak tree features prominently in many Celtic cultures. The ancient geographer Strabo (1st century AD) reported that the important sacred grove and meeting-place of the Galatian Celts of Asia Minor, Drunemeton, was filled with oaks. In an often-cited passage from Historia Naturalis (1st century AD), Pliny the Elder describes a festival on the sixth day of the moon where the druids climbed an oak tree, cut a bough of mistletoe, and sacrificed two white bulls as part of a fertility rite. Britons under Roman occupation worshipped a goddess of the oak tree, Daron, whose name is commemorated in a rivulet in Gwynedd. According to the pseudo-history Lebor Gabála 'Book of Invasions', the sacred oak of early Ireland was that of Mugna, probably located at or near Dunmanogoe, south Co. Kildare. Sacred associations of oaks survived Christianization, so that St Brigit's monastic foundation was at Cill Dara, 'church of (the) oak', i.e. Kildare, and St Colum Cille favoured Doire Calgaich 'Calgach's oak grove', i.e. Derry; see also Durrow, darú, from dair magh, 'oak plain'. In Welsh tradition Gwydion and Math use the flower of oak with broom to fashion the beautiful Blodeuwedd. When Lleu Llaw Gyffes is about to be killed by Gronw Pebyr, his wife's lover, he escapes in eagle form onto a magic oak tree. In British fairy lore, the oak is one of three primary magical woods, along with ash and thorn. \n\nIn Proto-Celtic the words for \"oak\" were *\"daru\" and *\"derwā\"; Old Irish and Modern Irish, \"dair\"; Scottish Gaelic, \"darach\"; Manx, \"daragh\"; Welsh, \"derwen, dâr\"; Cornish \"derowen\"; Breton, \"dervenn\".\n\nThe ash tree also features strongly in Irish mythology. The mountain ash, rowan, or quicken tree is particularly prominent in Scottish folklore.\n\nThere are several recorded instances in Irish history in which people refused to cut an ash, even when wood was scarce, for fear of having their own cabins consumed with flame. The ash tree itself might be used in May Day (Beltaine) rites. Under the Old Irish word nin, the ash also gives its name to the letter N in the ogham alphabet. Together with the oak and thorn, the ash is part of a magical trilogy in fairy lore. Ash seedpods may be used in divination, and the wood has the power to ward off fairies, especially on the Isle of Man. In Gaelic Scotland children were given the astringent sap of the tree as a medicine and as a protection against witch-craft. Some famous ash trees were the Tree of Uisnech, the Bough of Dathí, and the Tree of Tortu. The French poet who used Breton sources, Marie de France (late 12th century), wrote a lai about an ash tree. The Proto-Celti for 'ash' was *\"onnos\"; Old Irish, \"nin\"; Irish, \"fuinseog\"; Scots Gaelic, \"fuinnseann\"; Manx, \"unjin\"; Welsh, \"onnen\"; Cornish, \"onnen\"; Breton, \"onnenn\".\n\nThe pome fruit and tree of the apple is celebrated in numerous functions in Celtic mythology, legend, and folklore; it is an emblem of fruitfulness and sometimes a means to immortality. Wands of druids were made from wood either of the yew or of the apple. The Brythonic Avalon in Arthurian tradition in certain medieval narratives, attributing Welsh origin, is translated as \"Insula Pomorum\"; 'The Isle of Apples'. One gloss of the name for the magical Irish island Emain Ablach is 'Emain of the Apples'. In the Ulster Cycle the soul of Cú Roí was confined in an apple that lay in the stomach of a salmon which appeared once every seven years. Cúchulainn once gained his escape by following the path of a rolled apple. An apple-tree grew from the grave of the tragic lover Ailinn. In the Irish tale Echtra Condla (The Adventure of Conle), Conle the son of Conn is fed an apple by a fairy lover, which sustains him with food and drink for a month without diminishing; but it also makes him long for the woman and the beautiful country of women to which his lover is enticing him. In the Irish story from the Mythological Cycle, Oidheadh Chlainne Tuireann, the first task given the Children of Tuireann is to retrieve the Apples of the Hesperides (or Hisbernia). Afallennau (Welsh, 'apple trees') is a 12th-century Welsh narrative poem dealing with Myrddin Wyllt. The Breton pseudosaint Konorin was reborn by means of an apple. The Proto-Celtic word was *\"aballā\"; Old Irish, \"uball\", \"ubull\"; Modern Irish. \"ubhal\", \"úll\"; Scots Gaelic \"ubhall\"; Manx, \"ooyl\"; Welsh, \"afal\"; Corn. \"aval\"; Bret. \"Aval\".\n\nBoth the wood and the edible nuts of the hazel have played important roles in Irish and Welsh traditions. Hazel leaves and nuts are found in early British burial mounds and shaft-wells, especially at Ashill, Norfolk. The place-name story for Fordruim, an early name for Tara, describes it as a pleasant hazel wood. In the ogham alphabet of early Ireland, the letter C was represented by hazel [OIr. coll]. According to Robert Graves, it also represented the ninth month on the Old Irish calendar, 6 August to 2 September. Initiate members of the Fianna had to defend themselves armed only with a hazel stick and a shield; yet in the Fenian legends the hazel without leaves was thought evil, dripping poisonous milk, and the home of vultures. Thought a fairy tree in both Ireland and Wales, wood from the hazel was sacred to poets and was thus a taboo fuel on any hearth. Heralds carried hazel wands as badges of office. Witches' wands are often made of hazel, as are divining rods, used to find underground water. In Cornwall the hazel was used in the millpreve, the magical adder stones. In Wales a twig of hazel would be given to a rejected lover.\n\nEven more esteemed than the hazel's wood were its nuts, often described as the 'nuts of wisdom', e.g. esoteric or occult knowledge. Hazels of wisdom grew at the heads of the seven chief rivers of Ireland, and nine grew over both Connla's Well and the Well of Segais, the legendary common source of the Boyne and the Shannon. The nuts would fall into the water, causing bubbles of mystic inspiration to form, or were eaten by salmon. The number of spots on a salmon's back were thought to indicate the number of nuts it had consumed. The salmon of wisdom caught by Fionn mac Cumhaill had eaten hazel nuts. Very similar tales related by Taliesin are retained in the Brythonic tradition. Traces of hazelnuts have been found in a 'Celtic' style three-chained suspension bowl discovered in a post-Roman burial dated to 650 CE in London.\n\nThe name of the Irish hero Mac Cuill means 'son of the hazel'. W. B. Yeats thought the hazel was the common Irish form of the tree of life. Proto-Celtic was *\"collos\"; Old Irish and Modern Irish \"coll'; Scots Gaelic, \"calltunn\", \"calltuinn\"; Manx, \"coull\"; Welsh, \"collen\"; Cornish, \"collwedhen\"; Breton, \"kraoñklevezenn\".\n\nThe alder, a shrub or tree of the birch family has special implications in Celtic tradition. The alder usually grows in wet ground, with small, pendulous catkins. Alders are especially associated with Bran; at Cad Goddeu, 'The Battle of the Trees', Gwydion guessed Bran's name from the alder twigs in his hand. The answer to an old Taliesin riddle 'Why is the alder purple?' is 'Because Bran wore purple'. Bran's alder may be a symbol of resurrection. The name for the boy Gwern, son of Matholwch and Branwen, means 'alder'. The place-name Fernmag (ang. Farney) means 'plain of the alder'.\n\nIn Ireland the alder was regarded with awe apparently because when cut the wood turns from white to red. At one time the felling of an alder was punishable, and it is still avoided. The alder was thought to have power of divination, especially in the diagnosing of diseases. Alder might be used in the fé, a rod for measuring corpses and graves in pre-Christian Ireland. The letter F, third consonant in the ogham alphabet, was named after the alder. The Proto-Celtic was *\"wernā\"; Old Irish \"fern\";. Modern Irish is \"fearnóg\"; Scots Gaelic, \"feàrna\"; Manx, \"farney\"; Welsh, \"gwernen\"; Cornish, \"gwernen\"; Breton, \"gwernenn\".\n\nThe elder, having clusters of white flowers and red or blackish berry-like fruit, has many associations with the fairy world in oral traditions of recent centuries in Celtic countries. On the Isle of Man, where elder grows abundantly and is called tramman, it is commonly thought of as the 'fairy tree'. In Ireland many individual elder trees were thought haunted by fairies or demons. Old Irish is \"tromm\"; Modern Irish is \"trom\"; Scots Gaelic, \"troman, droman\"; Welsh, \"ysgawen\"; Cornish, \"scawen\"; Breton, \"skavenn\".\n\nThe evergreen yew with dark green, needle-like leaves and red berries has commonly symbolized immortality in the Indo-European imagination as it is the longest-lived entity, often lasting more than 1,000 years, to be found in the European environment. It is still commonly planted in Christian churchyards and cemeteries. The druids preferred yew for wand-making over their other favourite woods, apple and oak. The name of the Eburones, a Gaulish people residing between the Main and Rhine, means 'people of the yew', while several Irish and Scottish place-names allude to the yew, notably Youghall [Eochaill, yew wood] in County Cork. The Irish personal name Eógan means 'born of the yew', so that the great Munster dynasty could be glossed as 'people of the yew'. According to the foundation story of Cashel, the Eóganacht capital, Corc mac Luigthig has a vision of a yew bush, with angels dancing over it, before settling on the site. One of Conchobar mac Nessa's residences at Emain Macha, Cráebruad, has nine rooms lined with red yew. Suibne Geilt in Buile Shuibhne (The Frenzy of Suibne) rests on yew trees during his flight. When Eógan and Lugaid mac Con are disputing they hear the magical music of the yew tree over a waterfall; the musician is revealed to be Fer Í (man of yew), the son of Eogabal. Wielders of the spear Gáe Assail are sure to kill their victims if they utter the word \"ibar\" (yew) as they cast. The agnomen of Cáer, the swan maiden, is Ibormeith [yew berry]. In oral variants of the Deirdre story, King Conchobar mac Nessa drives yew stakes through the hearts of the dead lovers, which later grow and intertwine near a church. Yet not all stories of the yew imply power or vitality. A rod named fé, made of yew or alder, was used to measure corpses and graves. And Fergus, the hapless brother of Niall Noígiallach (of the Nine Hostages) in Echtra Mac nEchach Muigmedóin (The Adventure of the Sons of Eochaid Mugmedón), signals his sterility when he rescues from a burning forge only the 'withered wood' of yew, which will not burn. The Proto-Celtic words for \"yew\" were *\"eburos\" and *\"iwos\"; Old Irish \"ibar\"; Modern Irish, \"iúr\"; Scots Gaelic, \"iubhar\"; Manx, \"euar\"; Welsh, \"ywen\"; Cornish, \"ewen\"; Breton, \"ivinenn\".\n"}

The CMTC was preceded by the Plattsburg Movement, a series of summer training camps that in 1915 and 1916 hosted some 40,000 men largely of elite social classes, the later CMTC trained some 400,000 men from 1921 to 1940.\n\nThe CMTC was a continuation of the \"Plattsburgh camps\", a volunteer pre-enlistment training program organized by private citizens before the U.S. entry into World War I. The camps were set up and funded by the Preparedness Movement, a group of influential pro-Allied Americans. They recognized that the standing U.S. Army was far too small to affect the war and would have to expand immensely if the U.S. went to war. The Movement established the camps to train additional potential Army officers during the summers of 1915 and 1916. The largest and best known was near Plattsburgh, New York and had such students as Grenville Clark, Willard Straight, Robert Bacon, Mayor John Purroy Mitchel & Bishop James De Wolf Perry.\n\n40,000 men (all college graduates) attended the Plattsburgh camp and other sites. They became physically fit, learned to march and shoot, and ultimately provided the cadre of a wartime officer corps. Enlistees were required to pay their own expenses. Suggestions by labor unions that talented working-class youth be invited to Plattsburgh were ignored.\n\nThese camps were formalized under the Military Training Camps Association, which in 1917 launched a monthly magazine, \"National Service\". (In 1922, the magazine was acquired by and folded into \"The American Army and Navy Journal, and Gazette of the Regular, National Guard and Reserve Forces\".)\n\nCMTC camps were a month in length and held at about 50 Army posts nationally. At their peak in 1928 and 1929, about 40,000 men received training, but as a whole the camps were a disappointment at their multiplicity of stated goals, but particularly in the commissioning of Organized Reserve officers. The program established that participants could receive a Reserve commission as a second lieutenant by completing four successive summer courses (titled Basic, White, Red, and Blue), but only 5,000 such commissions were awarded over the 20-year history of the CMTC. Apparently, no records exist that document total participation, but it is estimated that 400,000 men had at least one summer of training.\n\nAmong known participants were Harry S. Truman, Ronald Reagan, Robert Penn Warren, Walter S. McIlhenny, Chuck Yeager, and William Guarnere.\n\nCamp Edwin F. Glenn located at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis, Indiana, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.\n\n\n\n"}

Tsunogai \"et al.\"'s (1999) original work focused on the East China Sea, and the observation that, averaged over the year, its surface waters represented a sink for carbon dioxide. This observation was combined with others of the distribution of dissolved carbonate and alkalinity and explained as follows :\n\n\nBased on their measurements of the CO flux over the East China Sea (35 g C m y), Tsunogai \"et al.\" (1999) estimated that the continental shelf pump could be responsible for an air-to-sea flux of approximately 1 Gt C y over the world's shelf areas. Given that observational and modelling of anthropogenic emissions of CO estimates suggest that the ocean is currently responsible for the uptake of approximately 2 Gt C y, and that these estimates are poor for the shelf regions, the continental shelf pump may play an important role in the ocean's carbon cycle.\n\nOne caveat to this calculation is that the original work was concerned with the hydrography of the East China Sea, where cooling plays the dominant role in the formation of dense shelf water, and that this mechanism may not apply in other regions. However, it has been suggested that other processes may drive the pump under different climatic conditions. For instance, in polar regions, the formation of sea-ice results in the extrusion of salt that may increase seawater density. Similarly, in tropical regions, evaporation may increase local salinity and seawater density.\n\nThe strong sink of CO at temperate latitudes reported by Tsunogai \"et al.\" (1999) was later confirmed in the Gulf of Biscay, the Middle Atlantic Bight and the North Sea. On the other hand, in the sub-tropical South Atlantic Bight reported a source of CO to the atmosphere.\n\nRecently, work has compiled and scaled available data on CO fluxes in coastal environments, and shown that globally marginal seas act as a significant CO sink (-1.6 mol C m y; -0.45 Gt C y) in agreement with previous estimates. However, the global sink of CO in marginal seas could be almost fully compensated by the emission of CO (+11.1 mol C m y; +0.40 Gt C y) from the ensemble of near-shore coastal ecosystems, mostly related to the emission of CO from estuaries (0.34 Gt C y).\n\nAn interesting application of this work has been examining the impact of sea level rise over the last de-glacial transition on the global carbon cycle. During the last glacial maximum sea level was some 120 m lower than today. As sea level rose the surface area of the shelf seas grew and in consequence the strength of the shelf sea pump should increase.\n\nRippeth TP, Scourse JD, Uehara, K (2008).

It also may exhibit small protuberances from the top and may show the cauliflower form characteristic of cumulus clouds. Cumulus mediocris clouds do not generally produce precipitation of more than very light intensity, but can further advance into clouds such as Cumulus congestus or Cumulonimbus, which do produce precipitation.\n\nCumulus mediocris is also classified as a low cloud and is coded C2 by the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nCumulus mediocris is brilliantly white when sunlit, and is dark underneath. A single pattern-based variety, Cumulus radiatus, is sometime seen when the individual clouds are arranged into parallel rows. The resulting formations are known as \"cloud streets\" and are aligned nearly parallel to the wind.\n\nCumulus mediocris may have precipitation-based features like virga, and may form Cumulus praecipitato clouds. The pannus supplementary feature is sometimes seen with precipitating Cumulus mediocris, but in this case the C7 reporting code normally used with to identify pannus is usually superseded by C2, since there is significant vertical development. \"Pileus\" (cap cloud), \"velum\" (apron), \"arcus\" (roll or shelf cloud) and \"tuba\" (vertical column) features are also occasionally seen with cumulus mediocris. Cumulus mediocris may form as a result of a partial transformation of altocumulus or stratocumulus. This genus and species type may also be the result of a complete transformation of stratocumulus or stratus.\n\nThese clouds are common in the advance of a cold front or in unstable atmospheric conditions such as an area of low pressure. They can grow into larger Cumulus congestus which could bring rain, winds and in worse cases, thunder and lightning. If these clouds are present in the morning or early afternoon they show a significant instability in the atmosphere likely leading to storms later in the day.\n\nThese clouds occur when there is more rising air than the Cumulus humilis. Like any cumulus cloud, this cloud requires convection before developing. This occurs when pockets of air around them become warmer and begin to rise. As the air rises, it condenses forming a Cumulus humilis cloud as it continues to rise, a Cumulus mediocris.\n\n"}

{"id": "10928436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10928436", "title": "Dropstone", "text": "Dropstone\n\nDropstones are isolated fragments of rock found within finer-grained water-deposited sedimentary rocks. They range in size from small pebbles to boulders. The critical distinguishing feature is that there is evidence that they were not transported by normal water currents, but rather dropped in vertically through the water column.\n\nWhen deposited into fine layered mud, such evidence includes an impact depression beneath the dropstone, and indication that the mud has been squeezed up around the edges of the falling rock. Subsequent deposits of mud drape over the dropstone and its crater. Glacial dropstones, involving rocks falling out of icebergs, are one of the most common types of dropstone preserved in the geological record, particularly when deposited in low-energy deep sea or lake environments. Dropstones differ from erratics found in glacial till in that they are deposited in a lake or marine environments. Dropstones may also be deposited by a variety of non-glacial means.\n\nThere are five natural mechanisms that produce dropstones:\nAs glaciers move across a surface, they pluck rocks from it, and incorporate them into their mass. At the coast, fragments of glacier detach and float away as icebergs, which are often transported (ice rafted) many miles into the ocean, where they melt and deposit their load. When entrained rocks sink to the ocean floor, they can be incorporated into the oceanic sediments, which are typically fine grained.\n\nWhilst dropstones were once thought to be diagnostic of glaciers, it has since been realised that they can also be formed via volcanic eruptions. Volcanic bombs are large fragments of rock, projected many miles by the force of an eruption. If these land in fine sediments, they can form dropstones. Dropstones originating in this fashion are relatively rare in the geological record as most will land on high ground, which has a poor preservation potential as it is in an erosive environment. However, a large blast may spread bombs far enough for them to end up in a marine setting of fine enough sediment for them to be recognised.\n\nDropstones can also be deposited through the action of strong ocean-floor turbidity currents. Boulders the size of a human have been found in relatively recent finely laminated sediments near Jamaica, which has been a warm tropical island entirely devoid of glaciers since it came into existence. Whilst turbidity currents are cited as the origin of the boulders, they are not found in association with deposits formed by them.\n\nStones can also be transported large distances by becoming bound in a raft of floating plant material or in the roots of floating trees. When such a raft disintegrates due to waterlogging and sinking of its constituents, the transported rocks would also sink. Dropstones formed in this manner are typically associated with organic matter, especially logs – the fossilised remains of the raft that caused its transport.\n\nVertebrates may also act as \"rafts\" by ingesting gastroliths and depositing them in standing bodies of water by regurgitation or when the organism dies.\n\nMeteorites landing in marine depositional environments are a fifth category of dropstone. A number of meteorites have been found in Sweden's Thorsberg quarry, where they sank to the bottom of a shallow sea and were entombed in limestone 470 million years ago.\n\n"}
{"id": "32953202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32953202", "title": "Drought refuge", "text": "Drought refuge\n\nA drought refuge is a site that provides permanent fresh water or moist conditions for plants and animals, acting as a refuge habitat when surrounding areas are affected by drought and allowing ecosystems and core species populations to survive until the drought breaks. Drought refuges are important for conserving ecosystems in places where the effects of climatic variability are exacerbated by human activities.\n\nReliable drought refuges are characterised by the ability to retain sufficient water throughout the drought, having water quality good enough to maintain the life of the ecosystem that are not subject to physical disturbance and that have access to surrounding habitat, so that refugees can recolonise the main habitat when the drought ends.\n\nFor fish and aquatic invertebrates a drought refuge may be an isolated permanent pool in a stream that ceases to flow and mostly dries up during a period of drought. Permanent wetlands may serve as non-breeding drought refuges for a range of waterbirds that nest at ephemeral lakes when these are inundated.\n\n\"Drought refuge is a secure place persisting through a disturbance with the critical criterion being that after the disturbance the refuge provides colonist to allow populations to recover.\"\n\nFor some species the refuge is their only water source and is necessary for survival. For birds and invertebrate taxa, the drought refuge is not only necessary for survival but contribute to their reproductive success. Some organisms that are able to adapt to the environment when there is a drought but adapting traits that will be beneficial for survival in a prolong drought is extremely difficult to accomplish.\n\nThe term \"refugium\" (plural: \"refugia\") was originally used by evolutionary biologists for refuges that protected entire species from disturbance events of large temporal and spatial scales, such as glaciation or the long-term effects of climate change. A disturbance involves a temporary removal of biomass resulting in change in physical environment. Smaller-scale ecologists now use this term synonymously with the simpler term \"refuge\", to define places that protect populations of plants or animals from smaller-scale disturbances, such as fire, flood, storm, or human impacts. Refugia are the habitats or environmental factors that give spatial and temporal resistance and resilience to biotic communities impacted by disturbance. Here negative effects of disturbance are lower than surrounding areas or times. Refugia buffer species long-term, where as, a refuge buffers species short-term.\n\nThere are other uses of the term \"refuge\", such as for a wildlife reserve or a place free from predators (predation refuge). A refuge is a place or situation that provides safety or shelter. Here, species are minimally affected by changing climate conditions.\n\nLack of precipitation causes drying of aquatic ecosystems and leads to a natural disturbance called a drought. In order for organisms to survive a drought, the disturbance must be minimal or there must be a drought refuge available.\n\nThe severity of a disturbance is measured by its intensity, duration, and recovery time. Intensity and duration influence the strength of a disturbance and the likelihood of the survival of organisms within an area. Recovery time influences the level of recovery abundance and composition in a disturbed habitat until next stimulus forces species to seek shelter. Disturbances, such as drought, influence spatial and temporal patterns of refuge use, as well as the role of refuges in community dynamics. Variability in patterns of disturbance affect refuge use patterns and community structure. Decreased time between disturbances increases refuge usage until a certain frequency is reached and the usage declines as a result of the weakening resilience and resistance of a species. Refuge degradation increases mortality for sensitive species during larger disturbance times.\n\nDroughts decrease surface area and volume, while increasing physical and chemical water quality extremes, such as, temperature levels, oxygen concentration and water levels. This links with interactions that structure the communities of different species and affects mortality, birth and migration rates. During a drought, species must seek refuge or have adaptations that provide refuge.\n\nHydrological extremes, such as flood and drought, modify habitats. Droughts lead to not only the loss of habitats, but also to isolated habitat patches created by the separation of populations which together form a meta population. Increased density of organisms is another result of droughts. Increased organism density leads to resource limitations, movement limitations, increased competition, and increased predation pressure. Droughts also cause changes in food resources and water quality.\n\nDrought refuges protect plant and animal populations from extreme weather events as climate trends evolve . They serve as places that support populations of plants and animals not able to live elsewhere in a landscape during disturbance events, whether those events are seasonal and relatively predictable, or otherwise. A habitats ability to act as a refuge depends on the disturbance. The ability of a refuge to retain water becomes essential for the maintenance of most populations. Refuges of sufficient size and duration maintain populations, sustain biodiversity and may harbour relict populations. They are of particular importance during increasing aridification when few other suitable habitats remain. Biota depend heavily on seasonal refuges. Refuges increase survival rate and recovery time of populations experiencing an environmental disturbance. Refugial effectiveness is the ability of a refuge to fulfill habitat-related criteria. Knowledge of refuges in mediterranean and semi-arid streams and rivers has increased during the last decade.\n\nThe disturbance process and the recolonization process are two ecological processes which are associated with how refuges function. The disturbance process makes locations into refuges and the recolonization process restocks the wider landscape once a disturbance has passed. Recolonization is driven by resistance, local survival in drought refuges, or resilience, high local mortality with individuals moving back to streams when conditions improve.\n\nThe processes of disturbance, refuge formation, refuge function and recolonization occur at varying temporal and spatial scales. The spatial distribution of refuges influences the usage and recolonization. Spatial factors alone have a small contribution. Refuges vary with morphological and physicochemical factors as well; contribution is shared. Refuges can be small or large and can be used for short or long periods of time.\n\nRefugia are relative depending on species adaptations, spatial and temporal scale, and disturbance regime. Many relative influences are unclear as each situation is different. Drought refuges are important for sustaining biodiversity over larger spatial scales.\n\nPerennial waters are the most important drought refuge. As refuges, they require the least investment by stream invertebrates and have the greatest biodiversity. Perennial surface water is crucial to the survival of macroinvertebrate and fish. Differences in longitudinal pattern affect the location and function of perennial water refuges.\n\nRefuge occupancy is predictable based on species' traits, but not all suitable refuges within a system are occupied. Refuge community structure is mostly constant because the response to a disturbance carries across a species; the same species takes advantage of the same type of refuge. Refugia play a central role in the structuring of communities. Most non-perennial stream taxa appear to have more than one potential refuge from drought. The primary determinant of which drought refuges a species uses in a landscape are its intrinsic traits.\n\nThere are specific regions (refuges) to which individuals move during a drought, and within these regions there are specific characteristics of sites used as refuges by different species. A species may use more than one type of refuge during its life cycle. A variation in refuge use is caused by topography, individual species susceptibility and response to disturbance. Patterns of refuge use are influenced by disturbance type, species type, patch size, potential occupants and location. These patterns are poorly understood.\n\nDrought refuges form habitat mosaics which are prone to increased fragmentation by flow regulation. Some mosaics are more vulnerable to water abstraction than others. The drying of pools results in a patchy mosaic of pools in a dry channel which vary in suitability for different species and life stages. Different species favor different sized pools in different locations with different physicochemical properties. Refuges with low abundance of species require less effort to be adequate than diverse refuges. The size of a pool influences the set of species, total number of organisms, and assembly structure because of physicochemical factors. Species richness and abundance are related to pool morphology. Shade, location, and soil composition are all contributing factors. Heavily shaded pools have colder water, where as lightly shaded pools have increased levels of primary productivity. Large refuges have increased abundance and enrichment and are likely to persist through long disturbances.\n\nWhile used infrequently and often containing only few individuals during normal years, range edges may episodically serve as refuges from extreme weather events or conditions such as drought. During these extreme conditions, survival probability, reproductive success or both is higher at the edge than in the core of its range.\n\nRefuge use is influenced by habitat characteristics, such as hydrolic exchange and sediment type, active migration or passive habitat use and species morphology, behaviour and physiology. A decline in refuge use is due to decreased effectiveness of mortality reduction and reduced time provided for community recovery which leads to reduced time between disturbances.\n\nMovement into and out of refuge creates predictable fluxes of biomass and nutrients. This is important in food webs and the ecosystem. A dense amount of nutrients in one location during a disturbance means increased competition and predation. Rates of mortality, birth, migration, and interactions among components of the biota that have retreated to refugia are affected by the nature of the refuge. The spatial extent, the rate of drying, and the ambient physical and chemical conditions are all contributors.\n\nDrought refuges for algae are wide- spread because most med-river taxa can survive desiccation and show little specificity for refuges, provided drying occurs slowly. They include dry biofilm on stones and wood, dry leaf packs and perennial pools. Refuges for macrophytes and zooplankton typically comprise egg and seed banks in med-rivers and are resilient to prolonged drying.\n\nDrought leads to a shift in refuge spacing and connections at different spatial and temporal scales. Droughts disrupt hydrological connectivity and impact resident species through loss of water and flow from drying, habitat reduction, and reconfiguration. Delivery of water is restricted to areas within a stream network. Habitat patches engineered by members of community serve as refuges that are crucial for other members. Trails and ponds dug by certain species, like alligators, allow for dispersal into refuges. Hydrolic exchange provides movement of water, nutrients, and organisms into a refuge. Populations of sessile organisms, like flora and fauna in perennial water refuges, cannot persist indefinitely without hydrological connections among refuges. Mobile organisms, like fish, will move into a refugia if there are no barriers, like physical obstructions (ex: dams, isolated pools), biotic factors (ex: predation, competition), and physicochemical factors (ex: low dissolved oxygen levels).\n\nThe drought from 1996 until 2009 had a great impact on the Murray-Darling Basin, in Northern Australia (Murphy and Timbal 2007; Umenhofer et al. 2009). When this drought occurred, it dried the wetlands and water storages (the drought refuge). For many species of birds and fish, the refuge is the only freshwater available. The body of water serves as food and shelter; therefore, it must be conserved. Drought refuges are likely to sustain biodiversity over larger spatial scales such as groups of streams or whole drainage networks. Chester, E. T. and Robson, B. J. (2011), Drought refuges, spatial scale and recolonization by invertebrates in non-perennial streams. Freshwater Biology, 56: 2094–2104.\n\n A species may use more than one type of refuge during its life cycle. Refugia can be physical characteristics of organisms like short-term behavior or a long-term evolutionary adaptation.Animals and plants have mechanisms to increase resistance (survival) and resilience (recovery) to physical disturbance. They develop adaptations like morphology, physiology, behavior. Physical organism adaptations include an ability to aestivate, mouth orientation that allows for breathing oxygen at the water surface, body armor, and venomous spines.Mobile species' coping methods include refuge-seeking behavior; they seek habitat patches that relieve physiological stress and reduce mortality. Reliance on dispersal improves resilience to climate change in the short term, but over longer timescales, it will not protect macro invertebrate biodiversity from landscape-scale refuge degradation.\n\nBecause drought refuges may provide the only sites allowing populations to persist during droughts, they are highly vulnerable to factors that affect water quality such as water pollution and sedimentation from anthropogenic runoff. Consequently, in areas subject to intermittent drought, habitat conservation requires the identification and protection of drought refuges.\n\nDrought is specific to certain regions and climatic zones.Climate change in many med-regions may prolong dry periods and threaten refuges. The capacity for perennial refuges to support biodiversity may be severely compromised due to increasing water temperatures, reducing the quality of refuges by exceeding the thermal tolerance of invertebrates or by causing anoxia in stream pools and existing environmental degradation of many perennial water-ways.\n\nDroughts have the ability to reduce agriculture products and be the cause loss of crops and lives. Hence, reserving the refuge is of extreme importance in more ways than one. In order to conserve the drought refuge for these species, action needs to be taken that will effect short term and long term impacts that the drought have on the species that dwell on it for survival. In California, efforts to conserve the drought refuge there, include reserving water when possible. Water conservation is done in order to migrating bird populations (National Wildlife Refuge; March, 1, 2016). The National wildlife refuge also takes part in mowing, disking, spraying and controlled burns. These measures are taken in an effort to stop non-native vegetation from growing; this type of vegetation typically out grows the native when in drought. Thus, allowing for native vegetation to survive during drought, leading to the dependent species to forage on the available vegetation. The clean water act was passed in order to protect the American waters from pollution. Although the act does not protect all waters, it protects many bodies of water. When drought refuges are polluted, they become an even greater danger for the dwelling species. The clean water act is just one step in cleaning waters, and saving drought refuges \"(The Clean Water Rule; National Wildlife Organization).\"\n\nContinuous threats to the drought refuge conservation include; sedimentation, waterhole pumping, and the lack of the structure of the water, it is not near any other bodies of water. These of course, lead to situations where there is an extreme decrease in water availability. As water availability decreases, it increases the chances for dependent species to die out.\n\nConversely, where management of pest species is necessary, controlling them in their drought refuges during droughts may be more cost-effective than broad-scale control at other times. One example of this is controlling rabbits in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.\n"}

{"id": "7791685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7791685", "title": "Earth tide", "text": "Earth tide\n\nEarth tide (also known as solid Earth tide, crustal tide, body tide, bodily tide or land tide) is the displacement of the solid earth's surface caused by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. Its main component has meter-level amplitude at periods of about 12 hours and longer. The largest body tide constituents are semi-diurnal, but there are also significant diurnal, semi-annual, and fortnightly contributions.\nThough the gravitational forcing causing earth tides and ocean tides is the same, the responses are quite different.\n\nThe larger of the periodic gravitational forces is from the Moon but that of the Sun is also important.\nThe images here show lunar tidal force when the Moon appears directly over 30° N (or 30° S). This pattern remains fixed with the red area directed toward (or directly away from) the Moon. Red indicates upward pull, blue downward. If, for example the Moon is directly over 90° W (or 90° E), the red areas are centred on the western northern hemisphere, on upper right. Red up, blue down. If for example the Moon is directly over 90° W (90° E), the centre of the red area is 30° N, 90° W and 30° S, 90° E, and the centre of the bluish band follows the great circle equidistant from those points. At 30° latitude a strong peak occurs once per lunar day, giving a significant diurnal force at that latitude. Along the equator two equally sized peaks (and depressions) are equally sized, giving semi-diurnal force there.\n\nThe Earth tide encompasses the entire body of the Earth and is unhindered by the thin crust and land masses of the surface, on scales that make the rigidity of rock irrelevant. Ocean tides are a consequence of the resonance of the same driving forces with water movement periods in ocean basins accumulated over many days, so that their amplitude and timing are quite different and vary over short distances of just a few hundred km. The oscillation periods of the earth as a whole are not near the astronomical periods, so its flexing is due to the forces of the moment.\n\nThe tide components with a period near twelve hours have a lunar amplitude (earth bulge/depression distances) that are a little more than twice the height of the solar amplitudes, as tabulated below. At new and full moon, the Sun and the Moon are aligned, and the lunar and the solar tidal maxima and minima (bulges and depressions) add together for the greatest tidal range at particular latitudes. At first- and third-quarter phases of the moon, lunar and solar tides are perpendicular, and the tidal range is at a minimum. The semi-diurnal tides go through one full cycle (a high and low tide) about once every 12 hours and one full cycle of maximum height (a spring and neap tide) about once every 14 days.\n\nThe development of a systematic theory of Earth tides was started by George H. Darwin in 1879, and was then furthered by numerous authors, most notably by William Kaula in 1964.\n\nThe semi-diurnal tide (one maximum every 12 or so hours) is primarily lunar (only \"S\" is purely solar) and gives rise to \"sectorial\" deformations which rise and fall at the same time along the same longitude.\n\"Sectorial\" variations of vertical and east-west displacements are maximum at the equator and vanish at the poles. There are two cycles along each latitude, the bulges opposite one another, and the depressions similarly opposed.\nThe diurnal tide is lunisolar, and gives rise to \"tesseral\" deformations. The vertical and east-west movement is maximum at 45° latitude and is zero on the equator and at the poles.\nTesseral variation have one cycle per latitude, one bulge and one depression; the bulges are opposed (antipodal), that is to say the western part of the northern hemisphere and the eastern part of the southern hemisphere, for example, and similarly the depressions are opposed, the eastern part of the northern hemisphere and the western part of the southern hemisphere, in this case.\nFinally, fortnightly and semi-annual tides have \"zonal\" deformations (constant along a circle of latitude), as the Moon or Sun gravitation is directed alternately away from the northern and southern hemispheres due to tilt. There is zero vertical displacement at 35°16' latitude.\n\nSince these displacements affect the vertical direction east-west and north-south variations are often tabulated in milliarcseconds for astronomical use. The vertical displacement is frequent tabulated in μgal, since the gradient of gravity is location dependent so that the distance conversion is only approximately 3 μgal per cm\n\nIn coastal areas because the ocean tide is quite out of step with the earth tide, at high ocean tide there is an excess (or at low tide a deficit) of water about what would be the gravitational equilibrium level and the adjacent ground falls (or rises) in response to the resulting differences in weight. Displacements caused by ocean tidal loading can exceed the displacements due to the earth body tide. Sensitive instruments far inland often have to make similar corrections. Atmospheric loading and storm events may also be measurable, though the masses in movement are less weighty.\n\nPrincipal tide constituents. The amplitudes may vary from those listed within several per cent.\n\nVolcanologists use the regular, predictable Earth tide movements to calibrate and test sensitive volcano deformation monitoring instruments. The tides may also trigger volcanic events.\nSeismologists have determined that microseismic events are correlated to tidal variations in Central Asia (north of the Himalayas).\nThe semidiurnal amplitude of terrestrial tides can reach about 55 cm at the equator which is important in GPS, VLBI, and SLR measurements. Also to make precise astronomical angular measurements requires knowledge of the Earth's rate of rotation (length of day, precession, and nutation), which is influenced by earth tides (so-called pole tide). Terrestrial tides also need to be taken in account in the case of some particle physics experiments.\n\nFor instance, at the CERN or SLAC, the very large particle accelerators were designed while taking terrestrial tides into account for proper operation. Among the effects that need to be taken into account are circumference deformation for circular accelerators and particle beam energy.\n\nBody tides in planets and moons, as well as in binary stars and binary asteroids, play a key role in long-term dynamics of planetary systems. For example, it is due to body tides in the Moon that it is captured into the 1:1 spin-orbit resonance (and is always showing us one side). Owing to the body tides in it, Mercury is trapped in the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance with the Sun. \n\nFor the same reason, it is believed that many of the exoplanets are captured in higher spin-orbit resonances with their host stars.\n"}

Earthlings are the only form of life in the universe whose existence is known. Similar terms are Terran and Gaian.\n\nHistorically, the term \"earthling\" referred to a mortal inhabitant of the Earth as opposed to spiritual or divine entities. In Early Modern English, the word was used with the intention of contrasting \"earth\" with \"heaven\", and so presenting man as an inhabitant of the sublunary sphere, as opposed to heavenly creatures or deities. The derivation from the noun \"earth\" by means of the suffix \"-ling\" is already seen in Old English \"yrþling\", in the meaning \"ploughman\". The sense of \"inhabitant of earth\" is first attested in the 1590s. Its use in science fiction dates to 1949, in \"Red Planet\" by Robert A. Heinlein.\n\nThe word \"Human\" has the same imposed meaning, since it originates from a PIE word \"*ǵʰmṓ\" \"earthling\" < \"*dʰéǵʰōm\" \"earth\". Compare Latin \"homo\" \"human\" and \"humus\" \"earth, soil\".\n\nIts modern use in science fiction literature contrasts \"Earth\" (the planet) with outer space or hypothetical other planets with sapient life. The term was often used in 1950s science fiction film and novels by aliens to express a disdainful or patronizing tone towards creatures from Earth. The meaning \"creature from planet Earth\" in the context of space travel may be extended to non-human species, as in \"Russia fetes dog Laika, first earthling in space\".\n\nThe literary effect aimed for is a distancing effect, inviting the readers to contemplate their own species as it might be seen from an external point of view. There is also a belittling effect, in parallel with the use of the -ling suffix in such diminutives as \"duckling\" and \"gosling\". Especially in 1950s science fiction, use of the term is a conscious reversal of common assumptions of anthropocentrism or human exceptionalism, and may be an example of an exonym.\n\nIn some science fiction media (such as the \"Star Trek\" franchise and the 2014 movie \"Guardians of the Galaxy\") the term \"Terran\" is used as a term for humans, stemming from \"terra\", the Latin word for Earth. In the original run of the BBC series \"Doctor Who\", the phrase \"tellurian\" is used.\n\n"}
{"id": "13377974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13377974", "title": "Ecological trap", "text": "Ecological trap\n\nEcological traps are scenarios in which rapid environmental change leads organisms to prefer to settle in poor-quality habitats.\nThe concept stems from the idea that organisms that are actively selecting habitat must rely on environmental cues to help them identify high-quality habitat. If either the habitat quality or the cue changes so that one does not reliably indicate the other, organisms may be lured into poor-quality habitat.\n\nEcological traps are thought to occur when the attractiveness of a habitat increases disproportionately in relation to its value for survival and reproduction. The result is preference of falsely attractive habitat and a general avoidance of high-quality but less-attractive habitats. For example, Indigo buntings typically nest in shrubby habitat or broken forest transitions between closed canopy forest and open field. Human activity can create 'sharper', more abrupt forest edges and buntings prefer to nest along these edges. However, these artificial sharp forest edges also concentrate the movement of predators which predate their nests. In this way, Buntings prefer to nest in highly altered habitats where their nest success is lowest.\n\nWhile the demographic consequences of this type of maladaptive habitat selection behavior have been explored in the context of the sources and sinks, ecological traps are an inherently behavioral phenomenon of individuals. Despite being a behavioural mechanism, ecological traps can have far-reaching population consequences for species with large dispersal capabilities, such as the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) The ecological trap concept was introduced in 1972 by Dwernychuk and Boag and the many studies that followed suggested that this trap phenomenon may be widespread because of anthropogenic habitat change.\n\nAs a corollary, novel environments may represent fitness opportunities that are unrecognized by native species if high-quality habitats lack the appropriate cues to encourage settlement; these are known as perceptual traps. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that errors made in judging habitat quality can lead to population declines or extinction. Such mismatches are not limited to habitat selection, but may occur in any behavioral context (e.g. predator avoidance, mate selection, navigation, foraging site selection, etc.). Ecological traps are thus a subset of the broader phenomena of evolutionary traps.\n\nAs ecological trap theory developed, researchers have recognized that traps may operate on a variety of spatial and temporal scales which might also hinder their detection. For example, because a bird must select habitat on several scales (a habitat patch, an individual territory within that patch, as well as a nest site within the territory), traps may operate on any one of these scales. Similarly, traps may operate on a temporal scale so that an altered environment may appear to cause a trap in one stage of an organism’s life, yet have positive effects on later life stages. As a result, there has been a great deal of uncertainty as to how common traps may be, despite widespread acceptance as a theoretical possibility. However, given the accelerated rate of ecological change driven by human land-use change, global warming, exotic species invasions, and changes in ecological communities resulting from species loss, ecological traps may be an increasing and highly underappreciated threat to biodiversity.\n\nA 2006 review of the literature on ecological traps provides guidelines for demonstrating the existence of an ecological trap. A study must show a preference for one habitat over another (or equal preference) and that individuals selecting the preferred habitat (or equally preferred habitat) have lower fitness (i.e., experience lower survival or reproductive success). Since the publication of that paper which found only a few well-documented examples of ecological traps, interest in ecological and evolutionary traps has grown very rapidly and new empirical examples are being published at an accelerating rate. There are now roughly 30 examples of ecological traps affecting a broad diversity of taxa including birds, mammals, arthropods, fish and reptiles.\n\nBecause ecological and evolutionary traps are still very poorly understood phenomena, many questions about their proximate and ultimate causes as well as their ecological consequences remain unanswered. Are traps simply an inevitable consequence of the inability of evolution to anticipate novelty or react quickly to rapid environmental change? How common are traps? Do ecological traps necessarily lead to population declines or extinctions or is it possible that they may persist indefinitely? Under what ecological and evolutionary conditions should this occur? Are organisms with certain characteristics predisposed to being \"trapped\"? Is rapid environmental change necessary to trigger traps? Can global warming, pollution or exotic invasive species create traps? Embracing genetic and phylogenetic approaches may provide more robust answers to the above questions as well as providing deeper insight into the proximate and ultimate basis for maladaptation in general. Because ecological and evolutionary traps are predicted to add in concert with other sources of population decline, traps are an important research priority for conservation scientists. Given the rapid current rate of global environmental change, traps may be far more common than it is realized and it will be important to examine the proximate and ultimate causes of traps if management is to prevent or eliminate traps in the future.\n\nPolarized light pollution is perhaps the most compelling and well-documented cue triggering ecological traps. Orientation to polarized sources of light is the most important mechanism that guides at least 300 species of dragonflies, mayflies, caddisflies, tabanid flies, diving beetles, water bugs, and other aquatic insects in their search for the water bodies they require for suitable feeding/breeding habitat and oviposition sites (Schwind 1991; Horváth and Kriska 2008). Because of their strong linear polarization signature, artificial polarizing surfaces (e.g., asphalt, gravestones, cars, plastic sheeting, oil pools, windows) are commonly mistaken for bodies of water (Horváth and Zeil 1996; Kriska et al. 1998, 2006a, 2007, 2008; Horváth et al. 2007, 2008). Light reflected by these surfaces is often more highly polarized than that of light reflected by water, and artificial polarizers can be even more attractive to polarotactic aquatic insects than a water body (Horváth and Zeil 1996; Horváth et al. 1998; Kriska et al. 1998) and appear as exaggerated water surfaces acting as supernormal optical stimuli. Consequently, dragonflies, mayflies, caddisflies, and other water-seeking species actually prefer to mate, settle, swarm, and oviposit upon these surfaces than available water bodies.\n\n\n\n"}

The largest use is in cathode ray tubes (CRTs), used in nearly all television sets, computer displays and oscilloscopes that are not flat-panel displays. They are also used in field emission displays (FEDs), which are essentially flat-panel displays made out of rows of extremely small cathode ray tubes. They are also used in microwave linear beam vacuum tubes such as klystrons, inductive output tubes, travelling wave tubes, and gyrotrons, as well as in scientific instruments such as electron microscopes and particle accelerators.\nElectron guns may be classified by the type of electric field generation (DC or RF), by emission mechanism (thermionic, photocathode, cold emission, plasmas source), by focusing (pure electrostatic or with magnetic fields), or by the number of electrodes.\n\nA direct current, electrostatic thermionic electron gun is formed from several parts: a hot cathode, which is heated to create a stream of electrons via thermionic emission, electrodes generating an electric field which focus the beam (such as a Wehnelt cylinder), and one or more anode electrodes which accelerate and further focus the electrons. A large voltage between the cathode and anode accelerates the electrons. A repulsive ring placed between them focuses the electrons onto a small spot on the anode at the expense of a lower extraction field strength on the cathode surface. Often at this spot is a hole so that the electrons that pass through the anode form a collimated beam and finally reach a second anode called a collector. This arrangement is similar to an Einzel lens.\n\nMost color cathode ray tubes – such as those used in color televisions – incorporate three electron guns, each one producing a different stream of electrons. Each stream travels through a shadow mask where the electrons will impinge upon either a red, green or blue phosphor to light up a color pixel on the screen. The resultant color that is seen by the viewer will be a combination of these three primary colors.\n\nThe most common use of electron guns is in cathode ray tubes, which were widely used in computer and television monitors. An electron gun can also be used to ionize particles by adding or removing electrons from an atom. This technology is sometimes used in mass spectrometry in a process called electron ionization to ionize vaporized or gaseous particles. More powerful electron guns are used for welding, metal coating, 3D metal printers, metal powder production and vacuum furnaces.\n\nElectron guns are also used in medical linac, where high energy electron beams, hit a target and emit X-rays.\n\nA nanocoulombmeter in combination with a Faraday cup can be used\nto detect and measure the beams emitted from electron gun and ion guns.\n\nAnother way to detect electron beams from an electron gun is by using a phosphor screen\nwhich will glow when struck by an electron.\n\n\n"}

It is situated in Tallinn's Old Town.\n\nThe museum focuses on natural history and nature education, offering its visitors a tour in the wilderness of Estonia. The exhibition space consists of permanent exhibition and temporary showcases.\n\nThe foundation of the Estonian Museum of Natural History was laid by naturalists of the 19th century. The history of the museum goes back to an earlier museum, that of the Estonian Literary Society which was founded in 1842. This museum was active in exploring the natural sciences, an area that increased in significance at the museum in 1872 when Alexander von der Pahlen (1820–1895) began to contribute to the collection. Pahlen was later elected chairman and under his leadership the collection continued to grow.\n\nIt soon became apparent that a separate museum for natural history was needed. The collection was kept and displayed in a temporary building until 1911 when a building was purchased in Kohtu Street in Tallinn. The new Provincial Museum exhibited the art and natural sciences collection of the entire province of Harjumaa.\n\nThe collection was under threat of damage during the First World War so it was moved to Russia for safe keeping and returned when the war ended.\n\nThe Provincial Museum continued to operate under the Arts and Heritage Department of the Minister of Education and Research but changed its name back to The Estonian Literary Society in 1926.\n\nAfter the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Baltic-German institutions, including the Estonian Literary Society, were closed. In 1940, through the Regulation of the Council of People’s Commissars of the Estonian SSR, the Soviet authorities nationalized all museums allowing for a National Museum of Natural History to be established in Tallinn on January 1, 1941 .\n\nThe collections of the Estonian Museum of Natural History contain nearly 300 000 museum specimens. Approximately 90% of the plant, beetle, butterfly and moth, bird and mammal species found in Estonia are represented in the collections. A highly valuable part of the collections is made up by type specimens – the specimens used to provide the first description of a new taxon and serving as a definitive example of that taxon.\n\nThe principal botanical collection contains approximately 108,000 plant specimens.\n\nThe vascular plant herbarium includes 79,000 specimens, of which 77,000 are leaves, and the rest fruits, seeds, and strobili.\n\nMost of the material was collected in Estonia, and the collection contains specimens of a predominant part of the domestic flora - 1,600 taxons.\n\nThe mycological herbarium includes approximately 2,450 plant specimens. The unlichenized fungi collection contains 250 samples. Of the more than 2,200 specimens included in the lichen i.e. lichenized fungi collection, approximately 1,600 were collected in Estonia and 600 from abroad (mainly Scandinavia and other parts of Europe).\n\nThe zoological collections of the Museum of Natural History contain approximately 130,000 specimens. The collections boast a wide selection of both vertebrate and invertebrate species from Estonia as well as other parts of the world.\n\nThe zoological collections include:\n\nThe geological collection of the Museum of Natural History holds approximately 3,500 samples. Nearly three fourths of the specimens constitute paleontological material, the oldest specimens of which were collected in the mid-19th century. The dominant part of the paleontological collection is formed by Paleozoic fossils found in the Estonian bedrock. The most numerous samples among the preserved material include fossils of marine invertebrates from the Ordovician and Silurian Periods. The paleontological collections furthermore contain bone fractions and skeletal fragments of mammals of the Quaternary Period, most of which originate from Russia’s northern territories. Lithological collections hold typical sedimentary rocks of the Estonian bedrock: limestone, marl, sandstone, and mudstone. Petrological collections are small, with the main specimens being Estonian glacial erratic samples and samples of metamorphic rocks and igneous rocks collected from the territory of the former Soviet Union. The number of the Museum’s mineralogical specimens has increased significantly during the last decade, owing to domestic and foreign donations. While minerals inserted into the collections in previous years mostly come from Russia, Eastern Europe, and Germany, the contemporary collection includes minerals from Australia, South America, and Africa. Some of the most notable mineralogical samples include large quartz, amethyst, and fluoride druses.\n\nThe history of science collection with approximately 1 050 specimens comprises archival materials and historical items pertaining to the study and mediation of nature.\n\nThe photo collection contains photos, negatives and colour slides, 28 000 specimens in total, reflecting the daily life, exhibitions, field work and events of the museum throughout time. The photo collection of the museum has been digitised in the biodiversity information system PlutoF under the acronym TAMF.\n\n\n\n"}

They attempt to compare the strength of internationally active women's national teams at any given time.\n\n\nThe first two points result from the FIFA Women's World Rankings system being based on the Elo rating system adjusted for football; in 2018, FIFA modified the men's ranking system to similarly be based on Elo systems after continued criticism. FIFA considers the ratings for teams with fewer than 5 matches provisional and at the end of the list. Also any team that plays no matches for 18 months becomes unranked.\n\nTo date Germany and the United States have been the only two teams to have led the rankings. They have also held the top two spots in all but five releases, when Germany was ranked third: Norway was in second position in the first two rankings until Germany overtook them by winning the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup, Brazil was ranked second in March and June 2009 until Germany won 2009 Euro and rejoined the top two, and England reached the #2 ranking in March 2018.\n\nThe United States holds the record for the longest period being ranked first: almost 7 years, from March 2008 to December 2014.\n\nIn the latest rankings, action from Women's World Cup qualifying tournaments in UEFA and CONCACAF, as well as the 2018 Tournament of Nations, caused movement throughout the rankings, though three of the top five did not change. The United States (#1), Germany (#2), and Canada (#5) retained their positions while England (#3) and France (#4) swapped. Australia rose to #6 on a 33-point gain, the largest gain among any of the top 50 teams, though Uganda earned the most points of any team with 44.\n\nThe rankings are based on the following formulae:\n\nWhere\nThe average points of all teams are about 1300 points. The top nations usually exceed 2000 points. In order to be ranked, a team must have played at least 5 matches against officially ranked teams, and have not been inactive for more than 18 months. Even if teams are not officially ranked, their points rating is kept constant until they play their next match.\n\nThe main component of the actual result is whether the team wins, loses, or draws, but goal difference is also taken into account.\n\nIf the match results in a winner and loser, the loser is awarded a percentage given by the accompanying table, with the result always less than or equal to 20% (for goal differences greater than zero). The result is based on the goal difference and the number of goals they scored. The remaining percentage points are awarded to the winner. For example, a 2–1 match has the result awarded 84%–16% respectively, a 4–3 match has the result awarded 82%–18%, and an 8–3 match has the result awarded 96.2%–3.8%. As such, it is possible for a team to lose points even if they win a match, assuming they did not \"win by enough\".\n\nIf the match ends in a draw the teams are awarded the same result, but the number depends on the goals scored so the results will not necessarily add up to 100%. For example, a 0–0 draws earns both teams 47% each, a 1–1 draw earns 50% each, and a 4–4 draw earns 52.5% each.\n\nThe following is from a non-winning perspective (loss or draw). The factor for the winning team adds up to 100.\nAnd from a winning perspective.\n\"Source\"\n\nHistorically, home teams earn 66% of the points available to them, with away teams earning the other 34%. To account for this, when two teams are not playing on neutral ground, the home team has its formula_4 inflated by 100 points for the purposes of calculation. That is, if two equally ranked teams playing at one team's home ground, the home team would be expected to win at the same rate a team playing on neutral ground with a 100-point advantage. This 100 point difference corresponds to a 64%–36% advantage in terms of expected result.\n\nThis also helps define the scaling constant formula_5, which has a value of 200. In addition to a 100-point difference causing an expected result difference of 64%–36%, it also results in a 300-point difference causing expected results of 85%–15%.\n\nRankings are published four times a year, usually on a Friday.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1486300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1486300", "title": "Frost heaving", "text": "Frost heaving\n\nFrost heaving (or a frost heave) is an upwards swelling of soil during freezing conditions caused by an increasing presence of ice as it grows towards the surface, upwards from the depth in the soil where freezing temperatures have penetrated into the soil (the freezing front or freezing boundary). Ice growth requires a water supply that delivers water to the freezing front via capillary action in certain soils. The weight of overlying soil restrains vertical growth of the ice and can promote the formation of lens-shaped areas of ice within the soil. Yet the force of one or more growing ice lenses is sufficient to lift a layer of soil, as much as or more. The soil through which water passes to feed the formation of ice lenses must be sufficiently porous to allow capillary action, yet not so porous as to break capillary continuity. Such soil is referred to as \"frost susceptible\". The growth of ice lenses continually consumes the rising water at the freezing front. Differential frost heaving can crack road surfaces—contributing to springtime pothole formation—and damage building foundations. Frost heaves may occur in mechanically refrigerated cold-storage buildings and ice rinks. \n\nNeedle ice is essentially frost heaving that occurs at the beginning of the freezing season, before the freezing front has penetrated very far into the soil and there is no soil overburden to lift as a frost heave.\n\nAccording to Beskow, Urban Hjärne (1641–1724) described frost effects in soil in 1694. By 1930, Stephen Taber (1882–1963), head of the Department of Geology at the University of South Carolina (Columbia, South Carolina), had disproved the hypothesis that frost heaving results from molar volume expansion with freezing of water already present in the soil prior to the onset of subzero temperatures, i.e. with little contribution from migration of water within the soil.\n\nSince the molar volume of water expands by about 9% as it changes phase from water to ice at its bulk freezing point, 9% would be the maximum expansion possible owing to molar volume expansion, and even then only if the ice were rigidly constrained laterally in the soil so that the entire volume expansion had to occur vertically. Ice is unusual among compounds because it increases in molar volume from its liquid state, water. Most compounds decrease in volume when changing phase from liquid to solid. Taber showed that the vertical displacement of soil in frost heaving can be significantly greater than that due to molar volume expansion.\n\nTaber demonstrated that liquid water migrates towards the freeze line within soil. He showed that other liquids, such as benzene, which contracts when it freezes, also produce frost heave. This excluded molar volume changes as the dominant mechanism for vertical displacement of freezing soil. His experiments further demonstrated the development of ice lenses inside columns of soil that were frozen by cooling the upper surface only, thereby establishing a temperature gradient.\n\nThe dominant cause of soil displacement in frost heaving is the development of ice lenses. During frost heave, one or more soil-free ice lenses grow, and their growth displaces the soil above them. These lenses grow by the continual addition of water from a groundwater source that is lower in the soil and below the freezing line in the soil. The presence of frost-susceptible soil with a pore structure that allows capillary flow is essential to supplying water to the ice lenses as they form.\n\nOwing to the Gibbs–Thomson effect of the confinement of liquids in pores, water in soil can remain liquid at a temperature that is below the bulk freezing point of water. Very fine pores have a very high curvature, and this results in the liquid phase being thermodynamically stable in such media at temperatures sometimes several tens of degrees below the bulk freezing point of the liquid. This effect allows water to percolate through the soil towards the ice lens, allowing the lens to grow.\n\nAnother water-transport effect is the preservation of a few molecular layers of liquid water on the surface of the ice lens, and between ice and soil particles. Faraday reported in 1860 on the unfrozen layer of premelted water.\n\nThe same intermolecular forces that cause premelting at surfaces contribute to frost heaving at the particle scale on the bottom side of the forming ice lens. When ice surrounds a fine soil particle as it premelts, the soil particle will be displaced downward towards the warm direction within the thermal gradient due to melting and refreezing of the thin film of water that surrounds the particle. The thickness of such a film is temperature dependent and is thinner on the colder side of the particle.\n\nWater has a lower thermodynamic free energy when in bulk ice than when in the supercooled liquid state. Therefore, there is a continuous replenishment of water flowing from the warm side to the cold side of the particle, and continuous melting to re-establish the thicker film on the warm side. The particle migrates downwards toward the warmer soil in a process that Faraday called \"thermal regelation.\" This effect purifies the ice lenses as they form by repelling fine soil particles. Thus a 10-nanometer film of unfrozen water around each micrometer-sized soil particle can move it 10 micrometers/day in a thermal gradient of as low as 1 °C m. As ice lenses grow, they lift the soil above, and segregate soil particles below, while drawing water to the freezing face of the ice lens via capillary action.\n\nFrost heaving requires a frost-susceptible soil, a continual supply of water below (a water table) and freezing temperatures, penetrating into the soil. Frost-susceptible soils are those with pore sizes between particles and particle surface area that promote capillary flow. Silty and loamy soil types, which contain fine particles, are examples of frost-susceptible soils. Many agencies classify materials as being frost susceptible if 10 percent or more constituent particles pass through a 0.075 mm (No. 200) sieve or 3 percent or more pass through a 0.02 mm (No. 635) sieve. Chamberlain reported other, more direct methods for measuring frost susceptibility. Based on such research, standard tests exist to determine the relative frost and thaw weakening susceptibility of soils used in pavement systems by comparing the heave rate and thawed bearing ratio with values in an established classification system for soils where frost-susceptibility is uncertain.\n\nNon-frost-susceptible soils may be too dense to promote water flow (low hydraulic conductivity) or too open in porosity to promote capillary flow. Examples include dense clays with a small pore size and therefore a low hydraulic conductivity and clean sands and gravels, which contain small amounts of fine particles and whose pore sizes are too open to promote capillary flow.\n\nFrost heaving creates raised-soil landforms in various geometries, including circles, polygons and stripes, which may be described as palsas in soils that are rich in organic matter, such as peat, or lithalsa in more mineral-rich soils. The stony lithalsa (heaved mounds) found on the archipelago of Svalbard are an example. Frost heaves occur in alpine regions, even near the equator, as illustrated by palsas on Mount Kenya.\n\nIn Arctic permafrost regions, a related type of ground heaving over hundreds of years can create structures, as high as 60 metres, known as pingos, which are fed by an upwelling of ground water, instead of the capillary action that feeds the growth of frost heaves. Cryogenic earth hummocks are a small formation resulting from granular convection that appear in seasonally frozen ground and have many different names; in North America they are earth hummocks; thúfur in Greenland and Iceland; and pounus in Fennoscandia. \n\nPolygonal forms apparently caused by frost heave have been observed in near-polar regions of Mars by the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) aboard the Mars Global Surveyor and the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. In May 2008 the Mars Phoenix lander touched down on such a polygonal frost-heave landscape and quickly discovered ice a few centimetres below the surface.\n\nCold-storage buildings and ice rinks that are maintained at sub-freezing temperatures may freeze the soil below their foundations to a depth of tens of meters. Seasonally frozen buildings, e.g. some ice rinks, may allow the soil to thaw and recover when the building interior is warmed. If a refrigerated building's foundation is placed on frost-susceptible soils with a water table within reach of the freezing front, then the floors of such structures may heave, due to the same mechanisms found in nature. Such structures may be designed to avoid such problems by employing several strategies, separately or in tandem. The strategies include placement of non-frost-susceptible soil beneath the foundation, adding insulation to diminish the penetration of the freezing front, and heating the soil beneath the building sufficiently to keep it from freezing. Seasonally operated ice rinks can mitigate the rate of subsurface freezing by raising the temperature of the ice.\n\n"}

Glueballs are extremely difficult to identify in particle accelerators, because they mix with ordinary meson states.\n\nTheoretical calculations show that glueballs should exist at energy ranges accessible with current collider technology. However, due to the aforementioned difficulty (among others), they have so far not been observed and identified with certainty, although phenomenological calculations have suggested that an experimentally identified glueball candidate, denoted formula_1, has properties consistent with those expected of a Standard Model glueball.\n\nThe prediction that glueballs exist is one of the most important predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics that has not yet been confirmed experimentally. Glueballs are the only particles predicted by the Standard Model with total angular momentum (J) (sometimes called \"intrinsic spin\") that could be either 2 or 3 in their ground states.\n\nIn principle, it is theoretically possible for all properties of glueballs to be calculated exactly and derived directly from the equations and fundamental physical constants of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) without further experimental input. So, the predicted properties of these hypothetical particles can be described in exquisite detail using only Standard Model physics which have wide acceptance in the theoretical physics literature. But, there is considerable uncertainty in the measurement of some of the relevant key physical constants, and the QCD calculations are so difficult that solutions to these equations are almost always numerical approximations (reached by several very different methodologies). This can lead to variation in theoretical predictions of glueball properties like mass and branching ratios in glueball decays.\n\nTheoretical studies of glueballs have focused on glueballs consisting of either two gluons or three gluons, by analogy to mesons and baryons that have two and three quarks respectively. As in the case of mesons and baryons, glueballs would be QCD color charge neutral. The baryon number of a glueball is zero.\n\nTwo gluon glueballs can have total angular momentum (J) of 0 (which are scalar or pseudo-scalar) or 2 (tensor). Three gluon glueballs can have total angular momentum (J) of 1 (vector boson) or 3. All glueballs have integer total angular momentum which implies that they are bosons rather than fermions.\n\nGlueballs are the only particles predicted by the Standard Model with total angular momentum (J) (sometimes called \"intrinsic spin\") that could be either 2 or 3 in their ground states, although mesons made of two quarks with J=0 and J=1 with similar masses have been observed and excited states of other mesons can have these values of total angular momentum.\n\nFundamental particles with ground states having J=0 or J=2 are easily distinguished from glueballs. The hypothetical graviton, while having a total angular momentum J=2 would be massless and lack color charge, and so would be easily distinguished from glueballs. The Standard Model Higgs boson for which an experimentally measured mass of about 125–126 GeV/c has been determined is the only fundamental particle with J=0 in the Standard Model. It also lacks color charge and hence does not engage in strong force interactions. But the Higgs boson is about 25–80 times as heavy as the mass of the various glueball states predicted by the Standard Model.\n\nAll glueballs would have an electric charge of zero as gluons themselves do not have an electric charge.\n\nGlueballs are predicted by quantum chromodynamics to be massive, notwithstanding the fact that gluons themselves have zero rest mass in the Standard Model. Glueballs with all four possible combinations of quantum numbers P (parity) and C (c-parity) for every possible total angular momentum have been considered, producing at least fifteen possible glueball states including excited glueball states that share the same quantum numbers but have differing masses with the lightest states having masses as low as 1.4 GeV/c (for a glueball with quantum numbers J=0, P=+, C=+), and the heaviest states having masses as great as almost 5 GeV/c (for a glueball with quantum numbers J=0, P=+, C=-).\n\nThese masses are on the same order of magnitude as the masses of many experimentally observed mesons and baryons, as well as to the masses of the tau lepton, charm quark, bottom quark, some hydrogen isotopes, and some helium isotopes.\n\nJust as all Standard Model mesons and baryons, except the proton, are unstable in isolation, all glueballs are predicted by the Standard Model to be unstable in isolation, with various QCD calculations predicting the total decay width (which is functionally related to half-life) for various glueball states. QCD calculations also make predictions regarding the expected decay patterns of glueballs. For example, glueballs would not have radiative or two photon decays, but would have decays into pairs of pions, pairs of kaons, or pairs of eta mesons.\n\nBecause Standard Model glueballs are so ephemeral (decaying almost immediately into more stable decay products) and are only generated in high energy physics, glueballs only arise synthetically in the natural conditions found on Earth that humans can easily observe. They are scientifically notable mostly because they are a testable prediction of the Standard Model, and not because of phenomenological impact on macroscopic processes, or their engineering applications.\n\nLattice QCD provides a way to study the glueball spectrum theoretically and from first principles. Some of the first quantities calculated using lattice QCD methods (in 1980) were glueball mass estimates. Morningstar and Peardon computed in 1999 the masses of the lightest glueballs in QCD without dynamical quarks. The three lowest states are tabulated below. The presence of dynamical quarks would slightly alter these data, but also makes the computations more difficult. Since that time calculations within QCD (lattice and sum rules) find the lightest glueball to be a scalar with mass in the range of about 1000–1700 MeV.\n\nParticle accelerator experiments are often able to identify unstable composite particles and assign masses to those particles to a precision of approximately 10 MeV/c, without being able to immediately assign to the particle resonance that is observed all of the properties of that particle. Scores of such particles have been detected, although particles detected in some experiments but not others can be viewed as doubtful. Some of the candidate particle resonances that could be glueballs, although the evidence is not definitive, include the following:\n\n\n\n\nMany of these candidates have been the subject of active investigation for at least eighteen years. The GlueX experiment has been specifically designed to produce more definitive experimental evidence of glueballs.\n\n"}

{"id": "45057199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45057199", "title": "John Cato", "text": "John Cato\n\nJohn Chester Cato (2 November 1926 – 30 January 2011) was an Australian photographer and teacher. Cato started his career as a commercial photographer and later moved towards fine art photography and education. Cato spent most of his life in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nCato’s career in photography started at the age of 12 as an apprentice to his father, Jack Cato. Returning in 1946 after service in the Pacific for the Royal Australian during WW2, Cato worked as a self-employed photographer before being employed by Argus Newspaper as a photojournalist in 1947. Cato held that position until 1950 when he became a photographer and assistant for Athol Shmith Pty Ltd. in Collins Street, Melbourne and married Dawn Helen Cadwallader in October that year. During this period he undertook research for his father Jack on the latter's \"The Story of the Camera in Australia\" published in 1955. In 1955, Cato and Shmith became business partners and started Athol Shmith-John Cato Pty Ltd.\n\nWhen in 1959-60 the MoMA The Family of Man exhibition toured Australia Cato visited the show several times and was inspired by its humanist themes and optimism. He moved away from the commercial photography world in 1974 after experiencing what he described as \"a kind of menopause\". Shortly after leaving his partnership with Athol Shmith, Cato began his teaching career and started to focus on fine art photography. Cato was one of the first photographers in Melbourne to give up their commercial practice to become a fine art photographer.\n\nIn 1970, four years before leaving his commercial practice, Cato began exploring photography as an art form. His fine art photography drew connections between humanity and the environment, exploring a different theme in each photo essay.\n\nCato made 'straight' (directly imaged) landscape photographs usually with large or medium-format cameras in order to \"explore the elements of the landscape\", usually enhancing these in printing. Over a ten-year period, Cato spent two years at a time focusing on a particular symbolic theme in the Australian landscape, often spending a large amount of time in the wilderness observing the conditions and waiting for the perfect opportunity. He would often wait and contemplate a scene for days before finally pressing the shutter when the moment was right. Cato's work was deeply considered and clearly showed his unique perspective on the natural elements around us.\n\nCato frequently used symbolism and mysticism in his work. This was popular in the 1970s amongst both new and experienced photographers, including his colleague Paul Cox.\n\nThe debate around the question of the status of photography as an art form was quite relevant during Cato’s time. Some think of Cato as one of the first Australian photographers to blend the idea of a photograph being both a creative interpretation of a scene and a recording of reality. Some photographers of a similar era, such as Ansel Adams, were more technical in their photography, resulting in less manipulation or interpretation of the scene when compared to Cato’s work, whose imagery and photographic print making is more appropriately compared to that of Minor White or Bill Brandt. Cinematographer Nino Martinetti, one of Cato’s past students, said \"Look carefully at John Cato’s simple photographs of rocks, branches, trees, bark, sand, water and reflections… is that reality? Yes, but not as many people see it. This is the fine line where the art of photography and reality stand, where the artist captures an emotion for us to share and interpret.\"\n\nCato's personal work was described as \"a reflection of the psyche, not of light, that allows a consciousness to be present in the figuration of the photographic prints. The personal work is an expression of his self, his experience, his story and his language.\"\n\nEarth Song was Cato's first collection of personal work to be exhibited. This series consisted of 52 colour photographs sequenced in a way that allowed the work to be recognised as individual photographs and as part of an overall concept. Cato's use of musical analogies can be seen in the sequencing of Earth Song. The sequence was described as using \"melodic line and symphonic form as its metaphoric basis\".\n\nEarth Song was exhibited as part of the Frontiers exhibition, a group show at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1971. The group consisted of photographers who were exploring the idea of photography as an art form and were looking for a way to see the world differently through their camera.\n\nIn Cato's first photographic essay, he completed five black and white photo sequences between 1971 and 1979. In each sequence, Cato explored the expression of nature and creation, which he saw as the physical representation of his own life experiences and philosophy.\nEssay 2 is more politically driven compared to other work and focuses on \"the sublimation of Aboriginal culture by Europeans\". This series explores the idea of destruction of culture, spirituality and physicality using duality to represent the idea photographically.\n\nDouble Concerto was Cato's final photo essay. This photo essay was published under the deliberately androgynous 'Everyman' names Pat Noone and Chris Noone, two identities that Cato created to \"visualise alternative conditions within himself\". Each sequence explored how individual people can witness and experience the world very differently from each other. This series was exhibited as Cato's \"farewell show\" at Luba Bilu Gallery in Greville St. Prahran on his retirement from teaching.\n\nCato began his teaching career in 1975 at Prahran College of Advanced Education. Between 1977 and 1979 Cato contributed to the foundation of Photography Studies College and also lectured there until becoming head of the photography department at Prahran College of Advanced Education. Cato held the position of department head until his retirement in 1991. Cato was a passionate and generous teacher and was highly regarded by his students and peers. He described himself as being \"duty bound\" to share his experience with students and colleagues.\n\nMany of Cato's past students have gone on to hold well regarded positions in the photography, art and education fields. Amongst Cato’s students was Bill Henson, a well known Australian contemporary art photographer. Cato inspired Henson with his use of musical analogies, which Henson later incorporated in his own work.\n\nPaul Cox, one of Cato's colleagues at Prahran College of Advanced Education, stated that while the staff of Cato’s department were photographers, none of them were qualified teachers. Cox said \"Can you imagine that happening today? … At Prahran, teachers and students learnt from each other. It was an exchange.\"\n\nCato preferred to use large format cameras for the excellent quality and resolution that they offered. When taking students on camping trips, he insisted they use the same instead of 35mm SLR cameras, which were the 'weapon of choice' at the time, convinced that the more technical view camera would force students think before they pressed the shutter and pre-visualise their photograph, rather than to 'blaze away' with expendable roll film. Cato strongly believed in photography as a form of individualised expressionism, a view that was shared by Athol Shmith, who was one of the first to teach photography as a creative course in the late 1960s.\n\nCato exhibited his work with other photographers in 24 group exhibitions between 1964 and 2003. and in 17 solo exhibitions in Australian and international galleries. In 1973 he was included with Stan Ostoja-Kotkowski, Mark Strizic, Peter Medlen and John Wilkins in \"Frontiers\" at the NGV which toured to the Australian Embassy in Bankok, June 27– July 5 and showed at Abraxas Gallery, Manuka, in December 1974 with Sue Ford, Les Gray and Mark Strizic. Cato’s first solo exhibition was held at Horsham Art Gallery (Victoria, Australia) in 1975, with subsequent solo exhibitions being held every few years up until 2004.\n\nCato’s work is held in numerous gallery collections across Australia including the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria, Horsham Art Gallery, Albury Regional Art Gallery, Deakin University, Tasmanian Art Gallery and Melbourne State College. In addition to Australian galleries, Cato’s work is also held in collections in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris and Schmidtbank Weiden in Germany.\n\nPaul Cox and Bryan Gracey, both teachers at Prahran College, co-curated a collection of Cato’s work to be exhibited at the 2013 Ballarat International Foto Biennale. Cox and Gracey both believe that Cato’s work deserves to be seen and recognised for what it is. The exhibition features Cato’s black and white landscape photographs taken between 1971 and 1991. In regard to the exhibition, Paul Cox said \"John will ride a high wave. He belongs in the National Gallery, in the high echelons and I think this is a very wonderful first step.\"\n\nCato was known for being a very humble photographer. He never intended for himself or his work to become famous. In his mind, the work was its own reward. In the 2013 Ballarat International Foto Biennale guide, Cato was described as being \"underrated\" and \"far ahead of his time\".\n\nPaul Cox said the following in an article for \"The Australian\": \"He was a dreamer. I always adored him. John had a wonderful heart; he was tender for a man. You know you don’t know many people like that.\"\n\nDue to the fact he had a strong dislike of publicity, Cato would sometimes publish his work under a pseudonym, characteristically exhibiting his valedictory exhibition as 'Pat and Chris Noone' . Paul Cox said \"Ego is always the biggest limitation of an artist, but John had no ego. He was a free man.\" Isobel Crombie, head photography curator at the National Gallery of Victoria, shared Cox's opinion and said \"He was different in that he did not have the huge ego of some of his contemporaries.\"\n\nOver his career, Cato was active in national and international networking amongst the photographic and art education fields. He filled a number of honorary roles including one that was a request by Prahran graduates Euan McGillivray, the Curator of Photography at the Science Museum of Victoria, and Matthew Nickson, who worked at the Photography Department at RMIT, to chair the landmark conference 'Working Papers On Photography' (WOPOP) Australian Photography Conference, held at Prahran College of Advanced Education, Melbourne, from 19–21 September 1980.\n\nCato was honoured with numerous awards including Fellow at the Australian Institute of Professional Photographers (1991) and Honorary Doctor of Arts at RMIT University (1999). He was also awarded two grants, one a Visual Arts Board Travel Grant in 1985 and the other a Research and Development Grant from Victoria College in 1990.\n"}

This list only focuses on rivers which are suitable for whitewater sports such as canoeing, kayaking, and rafting.\n\n\n\n\nIn the north, most rivers in India descend from the Himalayas, the highest mountains on earth: cold glacial waters thunder down the rocks,bringing with them ample whitewater rapids to encounter.\nNorth India\n\nTowards the south, all rivers originate from the Western Ghats. Most of them can only be paddled in the monsoon season (June–October), while some others can be paddled year round as they are dependent on dam releases. Only a small percentage of the rivers have recorded descents, and there is a vast potential for first descents.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitewater rivers in the UK are typically low volume and technical. In England and Wales rivers are typically less than 20 m/s, and some are run with less than 1 m/s (usually these involve skidding the kayak down steep rockslides and small waterfalls). In Scotland there are also a few bigger volume (up to about 50 m/s) rivers.\n\nAlmost all runs in England and Wales need recent rain to be at a paddleable level, and many can only be run immediately after heavy rain. In Scotland some bigger rivers can be run for weeks after rain although as with the rest of the country, most need recent wet weather. The paddling season is year-round but the rivers are more often runnable in winter (the wettest months of the year being December and January). Exceptions to this include rivers which have artificially maintained flows from reservoirs. On these rivers flow may increase in dry weather as more water is released. The Afon Tryweryn is one example in Wales.\n\nMost runs offer only a few kilometres of whitewater; often several rivers can be run on a wet day. Some rivers consist of only a single rapid. Only a few rivers (such as the Findhorn and Spean in the Scottish Highlands) have more than a days' worth of paddling, and most of this tends to be grade III or less.\n\nThe River Dart excepted, there is no natural whitewater in the (mainly flat) south and east of England. Here whitewater paddlers often go playboating at man made weirs. Hurley weir on the River Thames west of London is probably the most popular. There are several artificial whitewater courses, where water is pumped or diverted though a concrete channel containing obstacles to create rapids. There is a 28 m/s artificial whitewater course on the Trent at Holme Pierrepont in Nottingham (at the National Watersports Centre), a 5 m/s course on the Tees in Teesside, and smaller courses on the Nene at Northampton, and at Cardington.\n\nIn England Commercial rafting is limited to artificial whitewater courses (where it often provides the majority of the courses' income). Bigger and more reliable rivers can be found in Scotland and Wales, in particular the River Findhorn, River Orchy, River Spey, River Tay and the Afon Tryweryn.\n\nThere are several sites off the west coast of Britain where strong tidal currents channeled between islands create big volume sections of whitewater. These include the Bitches in Pembrokeshire in Wales, and the Falls of Lora on the west coast of Scotland.\n\nLegal access to whitewater is a big issue in England and Wales. The law is currently unclear, resulting in two schools of thought followed. \n\nIn Scotland, like most of the rest of the world, access to whitewater is legal and has never been illegal. It has been enshrined in law in the recent Scottish Land Reform act. The Right to Roam act in England explicitly excluded rivers. The British Canoe Union is running the Rivers Access Campaign to raise awareness and bring about changes in the law to permit public access to all inland rivers in England and Wales.\n\nPopular whitewater rivers in the Alps are mainly medium volume glacier-fed rivers with long continuous rapids and few big drops. The season is short (two or three months in early summer when the snow and glaciers are melting) but the whitewater is reliable in this period. Tourists come from around Europe to kayak and raft–the most popular centres are Briançon in the French Alps, the area around Landeck in Austria, and Bovec in Slovenia.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a brief three to six week period in March and April snowmelt runoff explodes down the steep gorges creating the ultimate destination for any rafter or kayaker. While the Corsican whitewater season is short, the rocky island offers\n\nexciting whitewater in rivers such as Golo and Tavignano.\n\n\nThe best time to go rafting and kayaking in Greece is in Spring when the river flow and weather are ideal.\n\n\nSpring is the best time for rafting and kayaking in Southern Italy as the currents are stronger.\n\n\nRivers in Montenegro all come from high mountains close to the sea. They have natural riverbeds with very different sections from steep creeking to large volume. They have best water in spring, but some are runnable throughout the year.\n\nTara river, Kolašin, Mojkovac, Žabljak, Pljevlja, Plužine 130 km, Durmitor National Park Class 2-5\n\nMoraca river, Kolašin, Podgorica, Class 2-5\n\nLim river, Plav, Andrijevica, Berane, Bijelo polje, Class 2-4\n\nCijevna, Podgorica, Class 3\n\nNorwegian whitewater rivers are typically steep pool-drop rivers with many waterfalls, and are run mainly by experienced kayakers. There are also bigger (sometimes glacier-fed) rivers which are sometimes rafted. The season lasts all summer, although some rivers only run after recent rain. Norwegian waterfalls regularly feature on extreme kayaking videos.\n\nThe best time for whitewater in Portugal is in Spring during the higher river flow.\n\n\nWhite water sport in Russia is quite popular, but the vast majority of people uses catamarans for these purposes. \nThe best period for whitewater is May and July–August. Some rivers are possible to raft in June and September.\n\nHere is the list of the most popular rivers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudenica river (left tributary of Ibar) is very attractive for whitewater kayaking (III-V) \n\n\n\n\n\nLike the Alps whitewater in the Pyrenees is best in early summer when the snow and glaciers are melting.\n\n\nThe Swedish whitewater rivers are mainly big water and is located in the middle and north parts of Sweden. One of the most spectacular rivers is Vindelaelven and particularly Trollforsarna III-VI, where one Euro cup competition was held in 2007.\n\nThe main information channel for Swedish white water is Forsguiden,\n\nCanada has a varied terrain that supports many kinds of environments, with the majority of whitewater found in three areas: the mountainous Rockies in Alberta, the smaller Eastern forests of Quebec, Ontario, and some of the Maritimes, and the volcanic influenced geology of British Columbia. This creates the conditions necessary for whitewater: gradient, volume, and pressure. Like its neighbor to the south, First Nations had used the river systems as personal highways and built dugout canoes to run rapids; later French Canadian fur trappers used the same technique to collect beaver pelts and form small settlements.\n\nCanadian whitewater rivers are characterized by the dramatic difference between the high water spring run-off and the summer low water volume; the classification of rapids therefore changes from spring to summer. It also is highly subject to the change of seasons, where many places are frozen solid by October and, for example, runs that are ready in late May in the neighboring US Pacific Northwest are still too dangerous to attempt in British Columbia or too cold: the spring run-off of the glaciers has either not finished or the landscape is not fully thawed. \n\nMost of the land in Canada is not privately owned and likewise neither are the rivers. Many places in which water thunders through the terrain are on land that is either protected or very remote, so knowledge of first aid and the local wildlife is paramount. As with the United States to the South, rattlesnakes, grizzly bears, black bears, mountain lions, wolves, and two members of the lynx family are very much active at the height of rafting and kayaking season, and they do use the water as a source of food and sustenance. On multi day excursions in British Columbia or Alberta it is extremely important to know or learn to coexist with the grizzly bears that live there and may use some rapids for salmon fishing. Foreign visitors must learn to never take any food or anything with a sweet scent into their sleeping grounds and cook and eat many hundreds of yards away, hoisting all food supply or items that are perfumed, like soap, high on a branch hundreds of feet off the ground that is too slim to support the weight of a large brown bear. (These rules also apply for black bears in the East as well: both bears have excellent senses of smell and will not hesitate to rip open a tent to get something as simple as a breath mint.) They must also learn never to run away from predators as it attracts their attention. Dogs must be secured carefully in campsites at night as it is not safe for them to be outside by themselves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Canada, the United States offers varied terrain and conditions through which rivers pass, everything from the deserts of the southwest to glacial peaks in Alaska to Appalachian creeks that thunder through the glades to even a few that run right through the downtown sections of small cities and isolated hamlets. The geography is friendly to all whitewater disciplines depending on the particular river or creek, including rafts, canoes, kayaks, and more recently, paddleboards. In the past, Native Americans and later explorers like Lewis and Clark and John\nFrémont would run their canoes through the rapids and used the rivers like highways to trade and to travel between settlements.\n\nLegally, most rivers and creeks are not privately held. They are the property of the nation and its people and are overseen by individual state governments and a handful of federal government agencies in Washington, DC like the Department of the Interior, National Park Service, National Forest Service, and Bureau of Land Management. Dams may be held on a contract basis with the federal or state government, for example the energy company PG&E has dams in the Sierra Nevada range near Sacramento in California and this affects water volume. (Other entities like the Tennessee Valley Authority in the East have similar arrangements.) The Army Corps of Engineers and the operators of the dams themselves usually schedule releases in advance and this information is readily available to the public upon request.\n\nMany whitewater rivers and creeks exist in rather rural or wild conditions when compared to parts of Europe and thus are located in places where animals can bite back or harm visitors, including children and dogs. (Some require a substantial hike through forest, desert, or mountains to reach the put in and cannot be reached by car at all.) In no particular order or regard to specific geography, they would include grizzly bears, black bears, moose, bull elk, porcupines, cougars, bobcats, more than 15 species of rattlesnakes on both sides of the Mississippi, scorpions, copperheads, water mocassins and coral snakes. Beavers are usually extant on most rivers but prefer to build in the calmer sections where there are only minor riffles and their dams are easily portaged or surmounted. It is thus very wise to purchase a wildlife and wilderness guide before embarking on a trip as well as understand that there may be no hospital or towns for miles. First aid knowledge is paramount.\n\nPermits are required for certain rivers as a means of tracking who is on the river at a given time, how many people are out there, and these are available for a nominal fee. Littering while on the river is usually prohibited and can net a very heavy fine into the tens of thousands of dollars, plus have the net result of destroying habitat for several species.\n\nDogs, usually those weighing more than 14 kg, are a common sight on many trips where the rapids do not exceed class III+, though visitors from other countries should be made aware that such trips require a few things: vaccination against rabies, canine distemper, kennel cough, coronavirus, and Lyme disease, and the paperwork from the vet proving he has had them within the last six months. He has to be kept on a leash when not in the boat because if he is going to a place with wild beasts, he must be restrained lest he get himself into trouble: bears in particular will not hesitate to charge if a wandering pooch challenges them and neither will porcupines. For these reasons in all National Parks including the Grand Canyon, being off leash is absolutely forbidden. He needs to be able to obey his master and obey basic commands and in all watercraft he must have a life jacket so if he has to swim for it, he can doggy paddle to shore.\n\nDespite popular belief abroad, the Western USA is not the only place where there is true whitewater in the country: there are several places in the East where the water roars, everything from big rivers like the Delaware River to creeks that dive over large waterfalls, many exceeding . In fact, there used to be more of them but over time some of these have been dammed or altered; the upper portions of the Mississippi River near St. Paul Minnesota, for example, used to have very large rapids and several waterfalls. As of 2018, many of these dams are being removed or in talks to be removed as new and better ways of hydroelectric power and newer techniques of flood control are being explored.\n\nRivers in the eastern section of the United States are usually considered \"technical\" for a few reasons: first, unlike in the West, large portions of the East were cut through by glaciers long ago. This makes several rivers have rockier bottoms rather than the sandy bottoms of the West. Second, water volume: the volume is lower in the East. Rafters, canoers, and kayakers must often direct their craft through boulder-strewn sections of river, through narrow channels, squeezes, and shoals. Third, vegetation: unlike the more famous rivers like the Colorado, Eastern rivers tend to cut through temperate forests: if a tree falls down on the riverbank, improvisation is a must. All of this requires a degree of \"river reading\" skill, paddling precision, and understanding of hazards such as undercut rocks, strainers, and how to get unpinned from surprise obstacles.\n\nThe following are some of the rivers in the Northeast that are popular.\n\n\nSome signature streams in the southeastern United States include:\n\n\nIn the western United States, the more noted rivers, such as the Grand Canyon have much greater water volume and therefore require a different set of paddling skills. Western rafters also navigate many small, low volume rivers, some with much steeper descents than eastern rivers; however, since the mountains are newer in the west, the hazard from undercut rocks, a problem in the east, is replaced by more frequent log jams precipitated by logging activities near the rivers.\n\nThe big-water rivers usually do not require the precision paddling of smaller rivers, but have larger rapids and longer wilderness trips due to the greater length and water flow of the big rivers. The smaller rivers and creeks boated by most rafters offer many one- or two-day trips with difficulty levels from I to VI.\n\nIn the West, some paddlers start on the American in California and work their way up to the Rogue and Illinois in Oregon, the Tuolumne (California), the Salmon in Idaho, the Snake, and then the big-water rivers like the Green and Colorado through the Grand Canyon (Arizona), the Fraser in British Columbia, and many Alaskan streams.\n\nSeveral rivers in California are fed by the snowmelt of the Sierra Nevada mountain range as well as natural springs in high mountainous areas; some rivers flow directly through protected land and foreign visitors should be advised that early spring runs can be very dangerous; the normal classification cranks up much higher turning some runs into death traps for even Olympic level whitewater enthusiasts.\n\n\nCherry Creek should never be run before the end of May: before that the snowpack is not finished melting and because there is no way out of vertical sections like Cherry Bomb Gorge, a kayaker will most likely die as the water breaches class VI.\n\nThe first Class V, Gore Rapid, is tighly surrounded by several large Class-IV rapids. Most of the water flows to the river-left side of the rapid, where a very nasty and very sticky hydraulic runs into a large rock. The second Class-V Rapid, Tunnel Rapid, consists mostly of a single large ledge. On the right side of the rapid is a very nasty and very sticky hole that is bordered by a large rock on the left preventing people from exiting. On the left side of the ledge, the water is redirected right back into the large hole. The water is redirected by an undercut rock. Toilet bowl rapid forms a retentive hydraulic. Kirschbaum rapid (Class IV) is harder to scout due to its long runout and difficult travel on river right. Kirschbaum has some excellent waves that can hide holes.\nGore Canyon Classic whitewater race is THE Classic Class Five Whitewater Race in Colorado. Usually held in late August, sponsored and very competitive. Racing divisions consist of various whitewater kayak classes, whitewater raft teams and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular whitewater rivers in Oregon:\n\nThe most popular runs in Washington are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "99044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99044", "title": "Mare Imbrium", "text": "Mare Imbrium\n\nMare Imbrium (Latin for \"Sea of Showers\" or \"Sea of Rains\") is a vast lava plain within the Imbrium Basin on the Moon and is one of the larger craters in the Solar System. The Imbrium Basin formed from the collision of a proto-planet during the Late Heavy Bombardment. Basaltic lava later flooded the giant crater to form the flat volcanic plain seen today. The basin's age has been estimated using uranium–lead dating methods to 3938 ± 4 million years ago, the diameter of the impactor has been estimated to be 250 ± 25 km. The Moon's maria (plural of mare) have fewer features than other areas of the Moon because molten lava pooled in the craters and formed a relatively smooth surface. Mare Imbrium is not as flat as it was originally because later events have altered its surface.\n\nMare Imbrium may have been formed when a proto-planet in the asteroid belt collided with the moon, 3.8 billion years ago.\n\nWith a diameter of 1145 km, Mare Imbrium is second only to Oceanus Procellarum in size among the maria, and it is the largest mare associated with an impact basin.\n\nThe Imbrium Basin is surrounded by three concentric rings of mountains, uplifted by the colossal impact event that excavated it. The outermost ring of mountains has a diameter of 1300 km and is divided into several different ranges; the Montes Carpatus to the south, the Montes Apenninus to the southeast, and the Montes Caucasus to the east. The ring mountains are not as well developed to the north and west, and it appears they were simply not raised as high in these regions by the Imbrium impact. The middle ring of mountains forms the Montes Alpes and the mountainous regions near the craters Archimedes and Plato. The innermost ring, with a diameter of 600 km, has been largely buried under the mare's basalt leaving only low hills protruding through the mare plains and mare ridges forming a roughly circular pattern.\n\nThe outer ring of mountains rise roughly 7 km above the surface of Mare Imbrium. The Mare material is thought to be about 5 km deep, giving the Imbrium Basin a total depth of 12 km; it is thought that the original crater left by the Imbrium impact was as much as 100 km deep, but that the floor of the basin bounced back upwards immediately afterwards.\nSurrounding the Imbrium Basin is a region blanketed by ejecta from the impact, extending roughly 800 km outward. Also encircling the basin is a pattern of radial grooves called the \"Imbrium Sculpture\", which have been interpreted as furrows cut in the Moon's surface by large projectiles blasted out of the basin at low angles, causing them to skim across the lunar surface ploughing out these features. The sculpture pattern was first identified by Grove Karl Gilbert in 1893. Furthermore, a Moon-wide pattern of faults which run both radial to and concentric to the Imbrium basin were thought to have been formed by the Imbrium impact; the event literally shattered the Moon's entire lithosphere. At the region of the Moon's surface exactly opposite Imbrium Basin, there is a region of chaotic terrain (the crater Van de Graaff) which is thought to have been formed when the seismic waves of the impact were focused there after travelling through the Moon's interior. Mare Imbrium is about wide.\n\nA mass concentration (mascon), or gravitational high, was identified in the center of Mare Imbrium from Doppler tracking of the five Lunar Orbiter spacecraft in 1968. The Imbrium mascon is the largest on the moon. The mascon was confirmed and mapped at higher resolution with later orbiters such as Lunar Prospector and GRAIL.\n\nLike most of the other maria on the Moon, Mare Imbrium was named by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized.\n\nThe earliest known name for the mare may be \"The Shrine of Hecate\"; Plutarch records that the Ancient Greeks gave this name to the largest of the \"hollows and deeps\" on the Moon, believing it to be the place where the souls of the deceased were tormented. Ewen A. Whitaker argues that this likely refers to Mare Imbrium, \"the largest regular-shaped dark area unbroken by bright patches\" that can be seen with the naked eye.\n\nAround 1600, William Gilbert made a map of the Moon that names Mare Imbrium \"Regio Magna Orientalis\" (the Large Eastern Region). Michael van Langren's 1645 map named it \"Mare Austriacum\" (the Austrian Sea).\n\nMare Imbrium is visible to the naked eye from Earth. In the traditional 'Man in the Moon' image seen on the Moon in Western folklore, Mare Imbrium forms the man's right eye.\n\nOn 17 November 1970 at 03:47 Universal Time, the Soviet spacecraft Luna 17 made a soft landing in the mare, at latitude 38.28 N, and longitude 35.00 W. Luna 17 carried Lunokhod 1, the first rover to be deployed on the Moon. Lunokhod 1, a remote-controlled rover, was successfully deployed and undertook a mission lasting several months.\n\nIn 1971, the crewed Apollo 15 mission landed in the southeastern region of Mare Imbrium, between Hadley Rille and the Apennine Mountains. Commander David Scott and Lunar Module Pilot James Irwin spent three days on the surface of the Moon, including 18½ hours outside the spacecraft on lunar extra-vehicular activity. Command Module Pilot Alfred Worden remained in orbit and acquired hundreds of high-resolution photographs of Mare Imbrium (and other regions of the moon) as well as other types of scientific data. The crew on the surface explored the area using the first lunar rover and returned to Earth with of lunar surface material. Samples were collected from Mons Hadley Delta, believed to be a fault block of pre-Imbrian (Nectarian or Pre-Nectarian) lunar crust, including the \"Genesis Rock.\" This was also the only Apollo mission to visit a lunar rille, and to observe outcrops of lunar bedrock visible in the rille wall.\n\nOn March 17, 2013, an object hit the lunar surface in Mare Imbrium and exploded in a flash of apparent magnitude 4. The crater could be as wide as 20 meters. This was the brightest impact recorded since NASA’s lunar impact team began monitoring in 2005.\n\nChang'e 3 landed on 14 December 2013 on Mare Imbrium, about 40 km south of the 6 km diameter \"Laplace F\" crater, at 44.1260°N 19.5014°W.\nThe lander deployed the Yutu rover 7 hours and 24 minutes later. Chang'e 3 mission attempted to perform the first direct measurement of the structure and depth of the lunar soil down to a depth of , and investigate the lunar crust structure down to several hundred meters deep.<ref name=\"xinhuanet.com/politics/2012-06/\"></ref> The rover's ground penetrating radar found evidence of at least nine distinct rock layers, indicating that the area had surprisingly complex geological processes and is compositionally distinct from the Apollo and Luna landing sites.\n\n\n\n"}

The mission was intended to demonstrate that the United States had the ability to drop a hydrogen bomb anywhere in the world.\n\nLed by Major General Archie J. Old, Jr. as flight commander, five B-52B aircraft of the 93rd Bombardment Wing of the 15th Air Force took off from Castle Air Force Base in California on January 16, 1957, at 1:00 PM, with two of the planes flying as spares. Old was aboard \"Lucky Lady III\" (serial number 53-0394) which was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James H. Morris, who had flown as the co-pilot aboard the \"Lucky Lady II\" when it made the world's first non-stop circumnavigation in 1949. Heading east, one of the planes was unable to refuel successfully from a Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter and was forced to land at Goose Bay Air Base in Labrador. The second spare refueled with the rest of the planes over Casablanca, Morocco and then split off as planned to land at RAF Brize Norton in England.\n\nAfter a mid-air refueling rendezvous over Saudi Arabia, the planes followed the coast of India to Sri Lanka and then made a simulated bombing drop south of the Malay Peninsula before heading towards the next air refueling rendezvous over Manila and Guam. The three planes continued across the Pacific Ocean and landed at March Air Force Base near Riverside, California on January 18 after flying for a total of 45 hours and 19 minutes, with the lead plane landing at 10:19 AM and the other two planes following each other separated by 80 seconds. The flight was completed at an average speed of and was completed in less than half the time required by \"Lucky Lady II\" when it made the first non-stop circumnavigation in 1949. General Curtis LeMay was among the 1,000 on hand to greet the three planes, and he awarded all 27 crew members the Distinguished Flying Cross. Though Old called the flight \"a routine training mission,\" the Air Force emphasized that the mission demonstrated its \"capability to drop a hydrogen bomb anywhere in the world.\"\n\nThe National Aeronautic Association recognized the 93rd Bombardment Wing as recipient of the Mackay Trophy for 1957.\n\nMaj.

{"id": "25145903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25145903", "title": "Seismo-electromagnetics", "text": "Seismo-electromagnetics\n\nSeismo-electromagnetics are various electro-magnetic phenomena believed to be generated by tectonic forces acting on the earth's crust, and possibly associated with seismic activity such as earthquakes and volcanoes. Study of these has been prompted by the prospect they might be generated by the increased stress leading up to an earthquake, and might thereby provide a basis for short-term earthquake prediction. However, despite many studies, no form of seismo-electromagnetics has been shown to be effective for earthquake prediction. A key problem is that earthquakes themselves produce relatively weak electromagnetic phenomena, and the effects from any precursory phenomena are likely to be too weak to measure. Close monitoring of the Parkfield earthquake revealed no significant pre-seismic electromagnetic effects. However, some researchers remain optimistic, and searches for seismo-electromagnetic earthquake precursors continue.\n\nThe VAN method – named after P. Varotsos, K. Alexopoulos and K. Nomicos, authors of the 1981 papers describing it – measures low frequency electric signals, termed \"seismic electric signals\" (SES), by which Varotsos and several colleagues claimed to have successfully predicted earthquakes in Greece. Both the method itself and the manner by which successful predictions were claimed have been severely criticized and debated by VAN, but the critics have not retracted their views.\n\nSince 2001, the VAN group has introduced a concept they call \"natural time\", applied to the analysis of their precursors. Initially it is applied on SES to distinguish them from noise and relate them to a possible impending earthquake. In case of verification (classification as \"SES activity\"), natural time analysis is additionally applied to the general subsequent seismicity of the area associated with the SES activity, in order to improve the time parameter of the prediction. The method treats earthquake onset as a critical phenomenon.\n\nAfter 2006, VAN say that all alarms related to SES activity have been made public by posting at arxiv.org. One such report was posted on Feb. 1, 2008, two weeks before the largest earthquake in Greece during the period 1983–2011. This earthquake occurred on February 14, 2008, with magnitude () 6.9. VAN's report was also described in an article in the newspaper Ethnos on Feb. 10, 2008. However, Gerassimos Papadopolous complained that the VAN reports were confusing and ambiguous, and that \"none of the claims for successful VAN predictions is justified.\"\n\nIn his investigations of crystalline physics, Friedemann Freund found that water molecules embedded in rock can dissociate into ions if the rock is under intense stress. The resulting charge carriers can generate battery currents under certain conditions. Freund suggested that perhaps these currents could be responsible for earthquake precursors such as electromagnetic radiation, earthquake lights and disturbances of the plasma in the ionosphere. The study of such currents and interactions is known as \"Freund physics\".\n\nMost seismologists reject Freund's suggestion that stress-generated signals can be detected and put to use as precursors, for a number of reasons. First, it is believed that stress does not accumulate rapidly before a major earthquake, and thus there is no reason to expect large currents to be rapidly generated. Secondly, seismologists have extensively searched for statistically reliable electrical precursors, using sophisticated instrumentation, and have not identified any such precursors. And thirdly, water in the earth's crust would cause any generated currents to be absorbed before reaching the surface.\n\nQuakeFinder is a company focused on developing a system for earthquake prediction. The company has a long-standing collaboration with Freund. They have deployed a network of sensor stations that detect the electromagnetic pulses the team believes precede major earthquakes. Each sensor is believed to have a range of approximately 10 miles (16 km) from the instrument to the source of the pulses. As of 2016, the company says they have 125 stations in California, and their affiliate Jorge Heraud says he has 10 sites in Peru. Using these sensors, Heraud says that he has been able to triangulate pulses seen from multiple sites, in order to determine the origin of the pulses. He said that the pulses are seen beginning from 11 to 18 days before an impending earthquake, and have been used to determine the location and timing of future seismic events.\n\nHowever, insofar as a verifiable prediction would require a publicly-stated announcement of the location, time, and size of an impending event before its occurrence, neither Quakefinder nor Heraud have yet verifiably predicted an earthquake, much less issued multiple predictions of the type that might be objectively testable for statistical significance.\n\nIn the month prior to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake measurements of the earth's magnetic field at ultra-low frequencies by a magnetometer in Corralitos, California, just 7 km from the epicenter of the impending earthquake, started showing anomalous increases in amplitude. Just three hours before the quake the measurements soared to about thirty times greater than normal, with amplitudes tapering off after the quake. Such amplitudes had not been seen in two years of operation, nor in a similar instrument located 54 km away. To many people such apparent locality in time and space suggested an association with the earthquake.\n\nAdditional magnetometers were subsequently deployed across northern and southern California, but after ten years, and several large earthquakes, similar signals have not been observed. More recent studies have cast doubt on the connection, attributing the Corralitos signals to either unrelated magnetic disturbance or, even more simply, to sensor-system malfunction.\n\nStudy of the closely monitored 2004 Parkfield earthquake found no evidence of precusory electromagnetic signals of any type.\n\nTwo recent studies by Konstantinos Eftaxias and his colleagues examined ULF magnetic fields preceding major earthquakes. At the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, ULF radiation exhibited critical behavior, while at the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, the researchers found a depression of the horizontal ULF magnetic field, which may also be interpreted as a manifestation of criticality.\n\nProfessor Kosuke Heki of Hokkaido University in Japan said that he discovered by accident that GPS signals changed about 40 minutes before the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. Reviewing historical data for other earthquakes, he found that this same correlation occurred during other incidents. He suggested that the GPS signals were detecting variations in the levels of the TEC (total electron content) of the ionosphere in the hour preceding an earthquake.\n\nThe \"Detection of Electro-Magnetic Emissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions\" satellite, constructed by CNES, has made observations which show strong correlations between certain types of low frequency electromagnetic activity and the most seismically active zones on the Earth, and have shown a sharp signal in the ionospheric electron density and temperature near southern Japan seven days before a 7.1 magnitude earthquake occurred there (on August 29 and September 5, 2004, respectively).\n\nQuakesat is an earth observation nanosatellite based on 3 CubeSats. It was designed to be a proof-of-concept for collecting extremely low frequency earthquake precursor signals from space. The primary instrument is a magnetometer housed in a 2-foot (0.6 m) telescoping boom.The science behind the concept is disputed.\n\nESPERIA is an equatorial space mission mainly concerned with detecting any tectonic and preseismic related signals. More in general, it has been proposed for defining the near-Earth electromagnetic, plasma, and particle environment, and for studying perturbations and instabilities in the ionosphere-magnetosphere transition region. To study earthquake preparation processes and anthropogenic impacts in the Earth's surface, a phase A study has been realized for the Italian Space Agency.\n\nThe Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice (DESDynI) radar satellite, which was canceled in the White House's 2012 budget proposal, would have the capacity to identify elastic strain in tectonic plates, combining L-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar and a multi-beam infrared lidar to detect strains in the Earth’s surface that could lead to serious earthquakes.\n\nRussia and the United Kingdom agreed to jointly deploy two satellites in 2015 that will measure electromagnetic signals that are released from the earth's crust prior to earthquakes. The project is said to be able to \"help predict earthquakes and potentially save thousands of lives.\" \n\nAnother site of current research is China, where a satellite launch was planned for 2014, to provide data from ionospheric phenomena for comparison with seismo-electromagnetic phenomena on the ground. Such a link is partially borne out in the current literature, with ionospheric phenomena already shown to precede seismic phenomena by a few hours to days. The network would potentially show whether such ionospheric phenomena are sourced from ground electrical phenomena.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Big Four is also known as the Council of Four. It was composed of Woodrow Wilson of the United States, David Lloyd George of the United Kingdom, Vittorio Emanuele Orlando of Italy, and Georges Clemenceau of France.\n\nWoodrow Wilson (28 December 1856 – 3 February 1924) was elected President of the United States on the basis of domestic issues in 1912, and re-elected in 1916. He based his 1916 re-election campaign around the slogan \"he kept us out of war\", and had worked hard to broker a compromise peace. In early 1917 Berlin decided to launch all-out submarine warfare designed to sink American ships bringing supplies to Britain; in the Zimmermann Telegram it proposed a military alliance with Mexico to fight a war against the US. The nation was poorly armed when it went to war in April 1917, but it had millions of potential fresh soldiers, billions of dollars, and huge supplies of raw materials needed by the Allies. Officially Wilson kept the US independent of the Allies. In 1918 Wilson took personal control of negotiations with Germany, including the armistice. He issued his Fourteen Points, his view of a post-war world that could avoid another terrible conflict. It had an enormous impact on both sides in Europe, and made him the man of the hour in Paris. A leader of the Progressive Movement, he assembled a high-powered group of academic advisors to help him in Paris but his distrustful personality led him to break with a series of close advisors, most notably Colonel House. He made a major blunder by refusing to bring along any prominent Republicans to Paris, which politicised the American debate and weakened his support. His main goal was a long-term solution to end warfare based on the League of Nations and self-determination of nations. He paid special attention to creating new nations out of defunct empires, and was opposed to harsh terms and reparations imposed on Germany. A Presbyterian of deep religious faith, Wilson appealed to a gospel of service and infused a profound sense of moralism into his idealistic internationalism, now referred to as \"Wilsonianism\". Wilsonianism calls for the United States to enter the world arena to fight for democracy, and has been a contentious position in American foreign policy.\n\nDavid Lloyd George, (1863–1945) from the British Liberal Party was a highly effective leader of the coalition government that took power in late 1916 and managed the British war effort. However his coalition premiership was supported more by Conservatives than by his own Liberals, and the subsequent split was a key factor in the decline of the Liberal Party as a serious political force.\n\nHe won by a landslide in the election of 1918, held just after the war ended, where he spoke out for harsh terms against Germany. However, he was much more moderate at Paris. Unlike Clemenceau and Orlando, Lloyd George did not want to destroy the German economy and political system—as Clemenceau demanded—with massive reparations. When asked how he had done at the peace conference, he commented, \"Not badly, considering I was seated between Jesus Christ and Napoleon [Wilson and Clemenceau].\"\n\nIt has been said that \"Lloyd George was the most affable and the most resilient, and he was probably the best at negotiating\". In an article from the New York Times, it says that \"Lloyd George was a pragmatist determined to protect and expand the interests of the British Empire.\"\n\nVittorio Emanuele Orlando (19 May 1860 – 1 December 1952) was an Italian diplomat and political figure. He was born in Palermo, Sicily. His father, a landed gentleman, delayed venturing out to register his son's birth for fear of Giuseppe Garibaldi's 1,000 patriots who had just stormed into Sicily on the first leg of their march to build an Italian state. He is commonly nicknamed \"The Premier of Victory\".\n\nIn 1897 he was elected in the Italian Chamber of Deputies (Italian: Camera dei Deputati) for the district of Partinico for which he was constantly re-elected until 1925. He aligned himself with Giovanni Giolitti, who was Prime Minister of Italy five times between 1892 and 1921.\n\nAs Prime Minister of Italy, he went to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. He demanded the fulfilment of the \"secret Treaty of London of 1915, by which the Allies had promised Italy ample territorial compensation in Dalmatia for its entry into World War I.\" However, Woodrow Wilson brought forth considerable opposition to Orlando's demands. Therefore, Orlando failed to secure British or French support. This caused him to leave the Peace Conference. However, he returned a month later. \"Even then no solution satisfactory to Italy was found; Orlando resigned and was succeeded as premier by Francesco Nitti. The so-called \"Mutilated victory\" was used propaganda in the rise of Benito Mussolini. Opposing Fascism, Orlando gave up (1925) his seat in parliament and devoted himself to teaching and writing.\"\n\nAside from his prominent political role Orlando is also known for his writings, over a hundred works, on legal and judicial issues; Orlando was himself a professor of law.\n\nHe was among the fathers of the Republican Constitution being member of the Constitutional assembly also as speaker of the house. He was a candidate to be the first Italian President elected by the Parliament.\nGeorges Benjamin Clemenceau (French pronunciation: [ʒɔʁʒ klemɑ̃so]; 28 September 1841 – 24 November 1929) was a French statesman, physician, and journalist. He served as the Prime Minister of France from 1906 to 1909, and again from 1917 to 1920. \nHe is commonly nicknamed \"Le Tigre\" (The Tiger) and \"Père-la-Victoire\" (Father Victory) for his determination as a wartime leader.\n\n\"Succeeding Paul Painlevé as premier in November 1917, Clemenceau formed a coalition cabinet in which he was also minister of war. He renewed the dispirited morale of France, persuaded the allies to agree to a unified command, and pushed the war vigorously until the final victory. Leading the French delegation at the Paris Peace Conference, Clemenceau insisted on Germany's disarmament and was never satisfied with the Versailles Treaty. He was the main antagonist of Woodrow Wilson, whose ideas he viewed as too idealistic.\" For nearly the final year of World War I he led France, and was one of the major voices behind the Treaty of Versailles at the Paris Peace Conference in the aftermath of the war. Clemenceau was hoping that there would be more punishment put on Germany.\n\nWhile the Allies at the Paris Peace Conference made up more than twenty nations, the Big Four entered Versailles and were leading architects of the Treaty of Versailles which was signed by Germany; the Treaty of St. Germain, with Austria; the Treaty of Neuilly, with Bulgaria; the Treaty of Trianon, with Hungary; and the Treaty of Sèvres, with the Ottoman Empire. During the decision-making of the Treaty of Versailles, Orlando temporarily pulled out of the conference because Italian demands were not met, leaving the other three countries as the sole major architects of the talk, referred to as the \"Big Three\". The Italian delegation returned after 11 days.\n\n"}

Since their discovery in the late 1980s, research on these ozone depletion events (ODEs) has shown the central role of\nbromine photochemistry. Due to the autocatalytic nature of the reaction mechanism, it has been called bromine explosion. It's still not fully understood how salts are transported from the ocean and oxidized to become reactive halogen species in the air. Other halogens (chlorine and iodine) are also activated through mechanisms coupled to bromine chemistry. The main consequence of halogen activation is chemical destruction of ozone, which removes the primary precursor of atmospheric oxidation, and generation of reactive halogen atoms/oxides that become the primary oxidizing species. The different reactivity of halogens as compared to OH and ozone has broad impacts on atmospheric chemistry, including near complete removal and deposition of mercury, alteration of oxidation fates for organic gases, and export of bromine into the free troposphere. Recent changes in the climate of the Arctic and state of the Arctic sea ice cover are likely to have strong effects on halogen activation and ODEs.\n\n\n"}

The model was developed by an interagency team of scientists to replace the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and has been widely used in the United States and the world. WEPP requires four inputs, i.e., climate, topography, soil, and management (vegetation); and provides various types of outputs, including water balance (surface runoff, subsurface flow, and evapotranspiration), soil detachment and deposition at points along the slope, sediment delivery, and vegetation growth. The WEPP model has been improved continuously since its public delivery in 1995, and is applicable for a variety of areas (e.g., cropland, rangeland, forestry, fisheries, and surface coal mining). Dima gogolashyili yepp\n\nWEPP is applicable for a wide range of geographic and land-use and management conditions, and capable of predicting spatial and temporal distributions of soil detachment and deposition on an event or continuous basis at both small (hillslopes, roads, small parcels) and large (watershed) scales. Hillslope applications of the model can simulate a single profile having various distributions of soil, vegetation, and plant/management conditions. In WEPP watershed applications, multiple hillslopes, channels, and impoundments can be linked together, and runoff and sediment yield from the entire catchment predicted. The model has been parameterized for a large number of soils across the U.S. and model performance has been assessed under a wide variety of land-use and management conditions. In addition, WEPP can generate long-term daily climatic data with CLIGEN, an auxiliary stochastic climate generator. The CLIGEN database contains weather statistics from more than 2,600 weather stations in the United States. The WEPP climate database is supplemented by the PRISM database, which further refines the climatic data based on longitude, latitude, and elevation. WEPP can provide daily runoff, subsurface flow, and sediment output categorized into five particle-size classes: primary clay, primary silt, small aggregates, large aggregates, and primary sand, allowing calculation of selective sediment transport, and enrichment of the fine sediment sizes.\n\nOver the last decade, researchers have made significant improvements to the WEPP model. These include improved algorithms to simulate the effect of hydraulic structures and impoundments on runoff and sediment delivery, the addition of Penman-Monteith ET algorithms, subsurface converging lateral flow to represent variable source area runoff, improved canopy biomass routines for forested applications, and the incorporation of an alternative, energy-balance-based winter hydrologic routine. A number of modern graphical user interface programs have also been created, to assist in easier application of WEPP. The main interface for the model is a standalone Windows application (downloadable via: http://www.ars.usda.gov/Research/docs.htm?docid=10621), that allows a user to simulate hillslope profiles and small watersheds and have full control over all model inputs (Figure 1). Additionally, web-based interfaces allow very easy and rapid use of the model while accessing existing soil, climate, and management databases (Figure 2).\n\nA number of geospatial interfaces to WEPP (example in Figure 3) are also available:\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service has developed a suite of internet interfaces, the Forest Service WEPP (FS WEPP) interfaces, for easier applications by stakeholders in forest and rangeland management (forest engineers, rangeland scientists, federal and state regulatory personnel) and the general public. The interfaces can be readily accessed and run through the internet (http://forest.moscowfsl.wsu.edu/fswepp/), and do not require any in-depth understanding of the hydrology, hydraulic and erosion principles embedded in the WEPP model. The FS WEPP interfaces include:\n\n\n"}
