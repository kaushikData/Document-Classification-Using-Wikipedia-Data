This material may be sediment, volcanic arcs, seamounts, or other igneous features.\n\nAccretion involves the addition of material to a tectonic plate. When two tectonic plates collide, one of the plates may slide under the other, a process known as subduction. The plate which is being subducted, is floating on the asthenosphere and is pushed against the other, over-riding plate. Sediment on the ocean floor will often be scraped from the subducting plate. This causes the sediment to accumulate as a mass of material called an accretionary wedge (accretionary prism), which attaches itself to the upper plate. Volcanic island arcs or seamounts may collide with the continent, and as they are of relatively light material (i.e. low density) they will often not be subducted, but are added to the side of the continent.\n\nContinental plates are formed of rocks that are very noticeably different from the rocks that form the ocean floor. The ocean floor is usually composed of basaltic rocks which have a higher density than continental plates. In places where plate accretion has occurred, land masses may contain the dense, basaltic rocks that are usually indicative of oceanic lithosphere.\n\nThis process occurs wherever plates collide. Many examples occur around the Pacific Rim, including the western coast of North America, the eastern coasts of New Zealand and Asia. The Nankai accretionary complex of Japan, the Barbados Ridge in the Caribbean, the Mediterranean Ridge, and the Franciscan Assemblage of California are specific examples of accretionary wedges.\n\n"}

{"id": "2014417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2014417", "title": "Clear-air turbulence", "text": "Clear-air turbulence\n\nClear-air turbulence (CAT) is the turbulent movement of air masses in the absence of any visual clues, such as clouds, and is caused when bodies of air moving at widely different speeds meet.\n\nThe atmospheric region most susceptible to CAT is the high troposphere at altitudes of around as it meets the tropopause. Here CAT is most frequently encountered in the regions of jet streams. At lower altitudes it may also occur near mountain ranges. Thin cirrus clouds can also indicate high probability of CAT.\n\nCAT can be hazardous to the comfort, but rarely the safety, of air travelers.\n\nCAT in the jet stream is expected to become stronger and more frequent because of climate change, with transatlantic wintertime CAT increasing by 59% (light), 94% (moderate), and 149% (severe) by the time of CO2 doubling.\n\nClear-air turbulence is usually impossible to detect with the naked eye and very difficult to detect with a conventional radar, with the result that it is difficult for aircraft pilots to detect and avoid it. However, it can be remotely detected with instruments that can measure turbulence with optical techniques, such as scintillometers, Doppler LIDARs, or N-slit interferometers.\n\nAlthough the altitudes near the tropopause are usually cloudless, thin cirrus cloud can form where there are abrupt changes of air velocity, for example associated with jet streams. Lines of cirrus perpendicular to the jet stream indicate possible CAT, especially if the ends of the cirrus are dispersed, in which case the direction of dispersal can indicate if the CAT is stronger at the left or at the right of the jet stream.\n\nDetecting and predicting CAT is difficult. At typical heights where it occurs, the intensity and location cannot be determined precisely. However, because this turbulence affects long range aircraft that fly near the tropopause, CAT has been intensely studied. Several factors affect the likelihood of CAT. Often more than one factor is present. 64% of the non-light turbulences (not only CAT) are observed less than away from the core of a jet stream.\n\nA jet stream alone will rarely be the cause of CAT, although there is horizontal wind shear at its edges and within it, caused by the different relative air speeds of the stream and the surrounding air.\n\nRossby waves caused by this jet stream shear and the Coriolis force cause it to meander.\n\nA temperature gradient is the change of temperature over a distance in some given direction. Where the temperature of a gas changes, so does its density and where the density changes CAT can appear.\n\nFrom the ground upwards through the troposphere temperature decreases with height; from the tropopause upwards through the stratosphere temperature increases with height. Such variations are examples of temperature gradients.\n\nA horizontal temperature gradient may occur, and hence air density variations, where air velocity changes. An example: the speed of the jet stream is not constant along its length; additionally air temperature and hence density will vary between the air within the jet stream and the air outside.\n\nWind shear is a difference in relative speed between two adjacent air masses. An excessive wind shear produces vortices, and when the wind shear is of sufficient degree, the air will tend to move chaotically. As is explained elsewhere in this article, temperature decreases and wind velocity increase with height in the troposphere, and the reverse is true within the stratosphere. These differences cause changes in air density, and hence viscosity. The viscosity of the air thus presents both inertias and accelerations which cannot be determined in advance.\n\nVertical wind shear above the jet stream (i.e., in the stratosphere) is sharper when it is moving upwards, because wind speed decreases with height in the stratosphere. This is the reason CAT can be generated above the tropopause, despite the stratosphere otherwise being a region which is vertically stable. On the other hand, vertical wind shear moving downwards within the stratosphere is more moderate (i.e., because downwards wind shear within the stratosphere is effectively moving against the manner in which wind speed changes within the stratosphere) and CAT is never produced in the stratosphere. Similar considerations apply to the troposphere but in reverse.\n\nWhen strong wind deviates, the change of wind direction implies a change in the wind speed. A stream of wind can change its direction by differences of pressure. CAT appears more frequently when the wind is surrounding a low pressure region, especially with sharp troughs that change the wind direction more than 100°. Extreme CAT has been reported without any other factor than this.\n\nMountain waves are formed when four requirements are met. When these factors coincide with jet streams, CAT can occur:\n\nThe tropopause is a layer which separates two very different types of air. Beneath it, the air gets colder and the wind gets faster with height. Above it, the air warms and wind velocity decreases with height. These changes in temperature and velocity can produce fluctuation in the altitude of the tropopause, called gravity waves.\n\nIn the context of air flight, CAT is sometimes colloquially referred to as \"air pockets\".\n\nStandard airplane radars cannot detect CAT, as CAT is not associated with clouds that show unpredictable movement of the air. Airlines and pilots should be aware of factors that cause or indicate CAT to reduce the probability of meeting turbulence.\n\nAircraft in level flight rely on a constant air density to retain stability. Where air density is significantly different, for instance because of temperature gradient, especially at the tropopause, CAT can occur.\n\nWhere an aircraft changes its position horizontally from within the jet stream to outside the jet stream, or vice versa, a horizontal temperature gradient may be experienced. Because jet streams meander, such a change of position need not be the result of a change of course by the aircraft.\n\nBecause the altitude of the tropopause is not constant, an airplane that flies at a constant altitude would traverse it and encounter any associated CAT.\n\nOn May 1, 2017, Boeing 777 flight SU270 from Moscow to Thailand got into clear air turbulence. The aircraft suddenly dropped and 27 passengers who were not buckled up sustained serious injuries. The pilots were able to stabilize the plane and continue the flight. All passengers who needed medical attention were taken to Bangkok hospital upon arrival.\n\nWhen a pilot experiences CAT, a number of rules should be applied: \n\nBecause aircraft move so quickly, they can experience sudden unexpected accelerations or 'bumps' from turbulence, including CAT - as the aircraft rapidly cross invisible bodies of air which are moving vertically at many different speeds. Although the vast majority of cases of turbulence are harmless, in rare cases cabin crew and passengers on aircraft have been injured when tossed around inside an aircraft cabin during extreme turbulence (and in a small number of cases, killed, as on United Airlines Flight 826 on December 28, 1997). BOAC Flight 911 broke up in flight in 1966 after experiencing severe lee-wave turbulence just downwind of Mount Fuji, Japan.\n\nWake turbulence is another type of clear-air turbulence, but in this case the causes are quite different from those set out above. In the case of wake turbulence, the rotating vortex-pair created by the wings of a large aircraft as it travels lingers for a significant amount of time after the passage of the aircraft, sometimes more than a minute. When this occurs, the lingering turbulence caused by the wake of the wing tips can deflect or even flip a smaller aircraft on the ground or in the air. This phenomenon can also lead to accidents with large aircraft as well. Delta Air Lines Flight 9570 crashed at the Greater Southwest International Airport in 1972 while landing behind a DC-10. This accident led to new rules for minimum following separation time from \"heavy\" aircraft. American Airlines Flight 587 crashed shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport in 2001 due to pilot overreaction to wake turbulence from a Boeing 747. Many aircraft are now made with wingtip devices to improve both the lift-to-drag ratio and fuel economy - such devices may also marginally reduce the strength of the wingtip vortices. However, such changes are not operationally significant (i.e. do not change the distances or times at which it is safe to follow other aircraft).\n\n\n"}

She loved Helios in vain.\n\nHelios, having loved her, abandoned her for Leucothoe and left her deserted. She was so angered by his treatment that she told Leucothea's father, Orchamus, about the affair. Since Helios had defiled Leucothea, Orchamus had her put to death by burial alive in the sands. Clytie intended to win Helios back by taking away his new love, but her actions only hardened his heart against her. She stripped herself and sat naked, with neither food nor drink, for nine days on the rocks, staring at the sun, Helios, and mourning his departure. After nine days she was transformed into the turnsole, also known as heliotrope (which is known for growing on sunny, rocky hillsides), which turns its head always to look longingly at Helios' chariot of the sun. The episode is most fully told in Ovid, \"Metamorphoses\" iv. 204, 234–56.\n\nModern traditions substitute the turnsole with a sunflower, which according to (incorrect) folk wisdom turns in the direction of the sun (the original French form \"tournesol\" primarily refers to sunflower, while the English \"turnsole\" is primarily used for heliotrope).\n\nOne sculpture of Clytie is a Roman marble in the collection of Charles Townley.\n\nThe bust was created between 40 and 50 AD. Townley acquired it from the family of the principe Laurenzano in Naples during his extended second Grand Tour of Italy (1771–1774); the Laurenzano insisted it had been found locally. It remained a favorite both with him (it figures prominently in Johann Zoffany's iconic painting of Townley's library (\"illustration, right\"), was one of three ancient marbles Townley had reproduced on his visiting card, and was apocryphally the one which he wished he could carry with him when his house was torched in the Gordon Riots – apocryphal since the bust is in fact far too heavy for that) and with the public (Joseph Nollekens is said to have always had a marble copy of it in stock for his customers to purchase, and in the late 19th century Parian ware copies were all the rage.\n\nThe identity of the subject, a woman emerging from a calyx of leaves, was much discussed among the antiquaries in Townley's circle. At first referred to as Agrippina, and later called by Townley Isis in a lotus flower, it is now accepted as Clytie. Some modern scholars even claim the bust is of eighteenth century date, though most now think it is an ancient work showing Antonia Minor or a contemporaneous Roman lady in the guise of Ariadne.\n\nAnother famous bust of Clytie was by George Frederick Watts. Instead of Townley's serene Clytie, Watts's is straining, looking round at the sun.\n\nImages of Clytie in the Warburg Institute Iconographic Database\n"}
{"id": "367503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367503", "title": "Concretion", "text": "Concretion\n\nA concretion is a hard, compact mass of matter formed by the precipitation of mineral cement within the spaces between particles, and is found in sedimentary rock or soil. Concretions are often ovoid or spherical in shape, although irregular shapes also occur. The word 'concretion' is derived from the Latin \"con\" meaning 'together' and \"crescere\" meaning 'to grow'. Concretions form within layers of sedimentary strata that have already been deposited. They usually form early in the burial history of the sediment, before the rest of the sediment is hardened into rock. This concretionary cement often makes the concretion harder and more resistant to weathering than the host stratum.\n\nThere is an important distinction to draw between concretions and nodules. Concretions are formed from mineral precipitation around some kind of nucleus while a nodule is a replacement body.\n\nDescriptions dating from the 18th century attest to the fact that concretions have long been regarded as geological curiosities. Because of the variety of unusual shapes, sizes and compositions, concretions have been interpreted to be dinosaur eggs, animal and plant fossils (called pseudofossils), extraterrestrial debris or human artifacts.\n\nDetailed studies (i.e., Boles \"et al.\", 1985; Thyne and Boles, 1989; Scotchman, 1991; Mozley and Burns, 1993; McBride \"et al.\", 2003; Chan \"et al.\", 2005; Mozley and Davis, 2005) published in peer-reviewed journals have demonstrated that concretions form after sediments are buried but before the sediment is fully lithified during diagenesis. They typically form when a mineral precipitates and cements sediment around a nucleus, which is often organic, such as a leaf, tooth, piece of shell or fossil. For this reason, fossil collectors commonly break open concretions in their search for fossil animal and plant specimens. Some of the most unusual concretion nuclei, as documented by Al-Agha \"et al.\" (1995), are World War II military shells, bombs, and shrapnel, which are found inside siderite concretions found in an English coastal salt marsh.\n\nDepending on the environmental conditions present at the time of their formation, concretions can be created by either concentric or pervasive growth (Mozley, 1996; Raiswell and Fisher, 2000). In concentric growth, the concretion grows as successive layers of mineral precipitate around a central core. This process results in roughly spherical concretions that grow with time. In the case of pervasive growth, cementation of the host sediments, by infilling of its pore space by precipitated minerals, occurs simultaneously throughout the volume of the area, which in time becomes a concretion. Concretions are often exposed at the surface by subsequent erosion that removes the weaker, uncemented material.\n\nConcretions vary in shape, hardness and size, ranging from objects that require a magnifying lens to be clearly visible to huge bodies three meters in diameter and weighing several thousand pounds. The giant, red concretions occurring in Theodore Roosevelt National Park, in North Dakota, are almost in diameter. Spheroidal concretions, as large as in diameter, have been found eroding out of the Qasr El Sagha Formation within the Faiyum depression of Egypt. Concretions are usually similar in color to the rock in which they are found. Concretions occur in a wide variety of shapes, including spheres, disks, tubes, and grape-like or soap bubble-like aggregates.\n\nThey are commonly composed of a carbonate mineral such as calcite; an amorphous or microcrystalline form of silica such as chert, flint, or jasper; or an iron oxide or hydroxide such as goethite and hematite. They can also be composed of other minerals that include dolomite, ankerite, siderite, pyrite, marcasite, barite and gypsum.\n\nAlthough concretions often consist of a single dominant mineral, other minerals can be present depending on the environmental conditions which created them. For example, carbonate concretions, which form in response to the reduction of sulfates by bacteria, often contain minor percentages of pyrite. Other concretions, which formed as a result of microbial sulfate reduction, consist of a mixture of calcite, barite, and pyrite.\n\nConcretions are found in a variety of rocks, but are particularly common in shales, siltstones, and sandstones. They often outwardly resemble fossils or rocks that look as if they do not belong to the stratum in which they were found. Occasionally, concretions contain a fossil, either as its nucleus or as a component that was incorporated during its growth but concretions are not fossils themselves. They appear in nodular patches, concentrated along bedding planes, protruding from weathered cliffsides, randomly distributed over mudhills or perched on soft pedestals.\n\nSmall hematite concretions, dubbed \"blueberries\" due to their resemblance to blueberries in a muffin, have been observed by the \"Opportunity\" rover in the Eagle Crater on Mars. See Martian spherules.\n\nConcretions vary considerably in their compositions, shapes, sizes and modes of origin.\n\nSeptarian concretions or septarian nodules, are concretions containing angular cavities or cracks, called \"septaria\". The word comes from the Latin word \"septum\"; \"partition\", and refers to the cracks/separations in this kind of rock. Some websites incorrectly derive the term from the Latin word \"septem\", meaning \"seven\". Cracks are highly variable in shape and volume, as well as the degree of shrinkage they indicate. Although it has commonly been assumed that concretions grew incrementally from the inside outwards, the fact that radially oriented cracks taper towards the margins of septarian concretions is taken as evidence that in these cases the periphery was stiffer while the inside was softer, presumably due to a gradient in the amount of cement precipitated.\n\nThe process that created the septaria that characterize septarian concretions remains unclear. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, including the dehydration of clay-rich, gel-rich, or organic-rich cores; shrinkage of the concretion's center; expansion of gases produced by the decay of organic matter; or brittle fracturing or shrinkage of the concretion interior by either earthquakes or compaction (Pratt 2001; McBride \"et al.\" 2003). Septaria usually contain crystals, often calcite, that precipitated from circulating solutions. Siderite or pyrite coatings are also occasionally observed on the wall of the cavities present in the septaria, giving rise respectively to a panoply of bright reddish and golden colors.\nA spectacular example of septarian concretions, which are as much as in diameter, are the Moeraki Boulders. These concretions are found eroding out of Paleocene mudstone of the Moeraki Formation exposed along the coast near Moeraki, South Island, New Zealand. They are composed of calcite-cemented mud with septarian veins of calcite and rare late-stage quartz and ferrous dolomite (Boles \"et al.\" 1985, Thyne and Boles 1989). Very similar concretions, which are as much as in diameter and called \"Koutu Boulders\", litter the beach between Koutu and Kauwhare points along the south shore of the Hokianga Harbour of Hokianga, North Island, New Zealand. The much smaller septarian concretions found in the Kimmeridge Clay exposed in cliffs along the Wessex Coast of England are more typical examples of septarian concretions (Scotchman 1991).\n\nCannonball concretions are large spherical concretions, which resemble cannonballs. These are found along the Cannonball River within Morton and Sioux Counties, North Dakota, and can reach in diameter. They were created by early cementation of sand and silt by calcite. Similar cannonball concretions, which are as much as in diameter, are found associated with sandstone outcrops of the Frontier Formation in northeast Utah and central Wyoming. They formed by the early cementation of sand by calcite (McBride \"et al.\" 2003). Somewhat weathered and eroded giant cannonball concretions, as large as in diameter, occur in abundance at \"Rock City\" in Ottawa County, Kansas. Large and spherical boulders are also found along Koekohe beach near Moeraki on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The Moeraki Boulders and Koutu Boulders of New Zealand are examples of septarian concretions, which are also cannonball concretions. Large spherical rocks, which are found on the shore of Lake Huron near Kettle Point, Ontario, and locally known as \"kettles\", are typical cannonball concretions. Cannonball concretions have also been reported from Van Mijenfjorden, Spitsbergen; near Haines Junction, Yukon Territory, Canada; Jameson Land, East Greenland; near Mecevici, Ozimici, and Zavidovici in Bosnia-Herzegovina; in Alaska in the Kenai Peninsula Captain Cook State Park on north of Cook Inlet beach and on Kodiak Island northeast of Fossil Beach; Reports of cannonball concretions have also come from Bandeng and Zhanlong hills near Gongxi Town, Hunan Province, China.\n\nHiatus concretions are distinguished by their stratigraphic history of exhumation, exposure and reburial. They are found where submarine erosion has concentrated early diagenetic concretions as lag surfaces by washing away surrounding fine-grained sediments (Zaton 2010). Their significance for stratigraphy, sedimentology and paleontology was first noted by Voigt (1968) who referred to them as \"Hiatus-Konkretionen\". \"Hiatus\" refers to the break in sedimentation that allowed this erosion and exposure. They are found throughout the fossil record but are most common during periods in which calcite sea conditions prevailed, such as the Ordovician, Jurassic and Cretaceous (Zaton 2010). Most are formed from the cemented infillings of burrow systems in siliciclastic or carbonate sediments.\n\nA distinctive feature of hiatus concretions separating them from other types is that they were often encrusted by marine organisms including bryozoans, echinoderms and tube worms in the Paleozoic (e.g., Wilson 1985) and bryozoans, oysters and tube worms in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic (e.g., Taylor and Wilson 2001). Hiatus concretions are also often significantly bored by worms and bivalves (Taylor and Wilson 2001).\n\nElongate concretions form parallel to sedimentary strata and have been studied extensively due to the inferred influence of phreatic (saturated) zone groundwater flow direction on the orientation of the axis of elongation (e.g., Johnson, 1989; McBride \"et al.\", 1994; Mozley and Goodwin, 1995; Mozley and Davis, 2005). In addition to providing information about the orientation of past fluid flow in the host rock, elongate concretions can provide insight into local permeability trends (i.e., permeability correlation structure; Mozley and Davis, 1996), variation in groundwater velocity (Davis, 1999), and the types of geological features that influence flow.\n\nElongate concretions are well known in the Kimmeridge Clay formation of northwest Europe. In outcrops, where they have acquired the name \"doggers\", they are typically only a few metres across, but in the subsurface they can be seen to penetrate up to tens of metres of along-hole dimension. Unlike limestone beds, however, it is impossible to consistently correlate them between even closely spaced wells.\n\nMoqui Marbles, also called Moqui balls or \"Moki marbles\", are iron oxide concretions which can be found eroding in great abundance out of outcrops of the Navajo Sandstone within south-central and southeastern Utah. These concretions range in shape from spheres to discs, buttons, spiked balls, cylindrical forms, and other odd shapes. They range from pea-size to baseball-size. They were created by the precipitation of iron, which was dissolved in groundwater. They are further described by (Chan and Parry 2002, Chan \"et al.\" 2005, Loope et al. 2010, 2011).\n\nKansas pop rocks are concretions of either iron sulfide, \"i.e.\" pyrite and marcasite, or in some cases jarosite, which are found in outcrops of the Smoky Hill Chalk Member of the Niobrara Formation within Gove County, Kansas. They are typically associated with thin layers of altered volcanic ash, called bentonite, that occur within the chalk comprising the Smoky Hill Chalk Member. A few of these concretions enclose, at least in part, large flattened valves of inoceramid bivalves. These concretions range in size from a few millimeters to as much as in length and in thickness. Most of these concretions are oblate spheroids. Other \"pop rocks\" are small polycuboidal pyrite concretions, which are as much as in diameter (Hattin 1982). These concretions are called \"pop rocks\" because they explode if thrown in a fire. Also, when they are either cut or hammered, they produce sparks and a burning sulfur smell. Contrary to what has been published on the Internet, none of the iron sulfide concretions, which are found in the Smoky Hill Chalk Member were created by either the replacement of fossils or by metamorphic processes. In fact, metamorphic rocks are completely absent from the Smoky Hill Chalk Member (Hattin 1982). Instead, all of these iron sulfide concretions were created by the precipitation of iron sulfides within anoxic marine calcareous ooze after it had accumulated and before it had lithified into chalk.\n\nIron sulfide concretions, such as the Kansas Pop rocks, consisting of either pyrite and marcasite, are nonmagnetic (Hobbs and Hafner 1999). On the other hand, iron sulfide concretions, which either are composed of or contain either pyrrhotite or smythite, will be magnetic to varying degrees (Hoffmann, 1993). Prolonged heating of either a pyrite or marcasite concretion will convert portions of either mineral into pyrrhotite causing the concretion to become slightly magnetic.\n\nThese so-called fairy stones consist of single or multiple discs, usually 6–10 cm in diameter and often with concentric grooves on their surfaces. They form in Quaternary clay as calcium carbonate migrates to some small fossil or pebble. Fairy stones are particularly common in the Harricana River valley in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue administrative region of Quebec, and in Östergötland county, Sweden.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "321668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=321668", "title": "Curcumin", "text": "Curcumin\n\nCurcumin is a bright yellow chemical produced by some plants. It is the principal curcuminoid of turmeric (\"Curcuma longa\"), a member of the ginger family, Zingiberaceae. It is sold as an herbal supplement, cosmetics ingredient, food flavoring, and food coloring.\n\nChemically, curcumin is a diarylheptanoid, belonging to the group of curcuminoids, which are natural phenols responsible for turmeric's yellow color. It is a tautomeric compound existing in enolic form in organic solvents, and as a keto form in water.\n\nCurcumin has no confirmed medical use in spite of efforts to find one via both laboratory and clinical research. It is difficult to study because it is both unstable and not bioavailable. It is unlikely to produce useful leads for drug development.\n\nThe most common applications are as an ingredient in dietary supplement, in cosmetics, and as flavoring for foods, such as turmeric-flavored beverages in the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. As a food additive for gold-orange coloring in turmeric and prepared foods, its E number is E100.\n\nAnnual sales of curcumin have increased since 2012. The largest market is in North America, where sales exceeded US$20 million in 2014.\n\nCurcumin incorporates several functional groups whose structure was first identified in 1910. The aromatic ring systems, which are phenols, are connected by two α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups. The diketones form stable enols and are readily deprotonated to form enolates; the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group is a good Michael acceptor and undergoes nucleophilic addition.\n\nCurcumin is used as a complexometric indicator for boron. It reacts with boric acid to form a red-colored compound, rosocyanine.\n\nThe biosynthetic route of curcumin is uncertain. In 1973, Roughly and Whiting proposed two mechanisms for curcumin biosynthesis. The first mechanism involves a chain extension reaction by cinnamic acid and 5 malonyl-CoA molecules that eventually arylized into a curcuminoid. The second mechanism involves two cinnamate units coupled together by malonyl-CoA. Both use cinnamic acid as their starting point, which is derived from the amino acid phenylalanine.\n\nPlant biosyntheses starting with cinnamic acid is rare compared to the more common \"p\"-coumaric acid. Only a few identified compounds, such as anigorufone and pinosylvin, build from cinnamic acid.\n\nCurcumin, which shows positive results in most drug discovery assays, is regarded as a false lead that medicinal chemists include among \"pan-assay interference compounds\" attracting undue experimental attention while failing to advance as viable therapeutic or drug leads.\n\nFactors that limit the bioactivity of curcumin or its analogs include chemical instability, water insolubility, absence of potent and selective target activity, low bioavailability, limited tissue distribution, extensive metabolism. Very little curcumin escapes the GI tract and most is excreted in feces unchanged. If curcumin were to enter plasma in reasonable amounts there would be a high risk of toxicity since it is promiscuous, and interacts with several proteins known to increase the risk of adverse effects, including hERG, cytochrome P450s, and glutathione S-transferase.\n\nAs a component of turmeric, curcumin may interact with prescription drugs and dietary supplements. In high amounts, it may be unsafe for women during pregnancy. It may cause side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, hives, or dizziness.\n\nTwo preliminary clinical studies in cancer patients consuming high doses of curcumin (up to 8 grams per day for 3–4 months) showed no toxicity, though some subjects reported mild nausea or diarrhea.\n\n\"In vitro\", curcumin exhibits numerous interference properties which may lead to misinterpretation of results. Although curcumin has been assessed in numerous laboratory and clinical studies, it has no medical uses established by well-designed clinical research. According to a 2017 review of over 120 studies, curcumin has not been successful in any clinical trial, leading the authors to conclude that \"curcumin is an unstable, reactive, non-bioavailable compound and, therefore, a highly improbable lead\".\n\nThe US government has supported $150 million in research into curcumin through the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, and no support has been found for curcumin as a medical treatment.\n\nBharat Aggarwal was a cancer researcher at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, who as of April 2018 had 19 papers retracted for research fraud. Aggarwal's research had focused on potential anti-cancer properties of herbs and spices, particularly curcumin, and according to a March 2016 article in the \"Houston Chronicle\", \"attracted national media interest and laid the groundwork for ongoing clinical trials\". Aggarwal co-founded a company in 2004 called Curry Pharmaceuticals, based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., which was seeking to develop drugs based on synthetic analogs of curcumin. SignPath Pharma, a company seeking to develop liposomal formulations of curcumin, licensed three patents invented by Aggarwal related to that approach from MD Anderson in 2013.\n\nDespite concerns about safety or efficacy and the absence of reliable clinical research, some alternative medicine practitioners give turmeric intravenously, supposedly as a treatment for numerous diseases. In 2017, there were two serious cases of adverse events reported – one severe allergic reaction and one death – that were caused by injection of a curcumin emulsion product administered by a naturopath.\n\nIt was first isolated in 1815 when Vogel and Pierre Joseph Pelletier reported the isolation of a \"yellow coloring-matter\" from the rhizomes of turmeric and named it curcumin. Although curcumin has been used historically in Ayurvedic medicine, its potential for medicinal properties remains unproven as a therapy when used orally.\n\n"}

Redford's article \"The Empty Forest\" (1992), which was published in \"BioScience\". An \"empty forest\" refers to an ecosystem that is void of large mammals. Empty forests are characterized by an otherwise excellent habitat, and often have large, fully grown trees, although they lack large mammals as a result of human impact. Empty forests show that human impact can destroy an ecosystem from within as well as from without.\n\nMany of the large mammals that are disappearing, such as deer and tapirs, are important for seed dispersion. Many tree species that are very localized in their dispersion rely on mammals rather than the wind to disperse their seeds. Furthermore, when seed predation is down, trees with large seeds begin to completely dominate those with small seeds, changing the balance of plant life in an area.\n\nPredatory large mammals are important for increasing overall diversity by making sure that smaller predators and herbivores do not become overabundant and dominate. An absence of large predators seems to result in uneven densities of prey species. Even though certain animals may not have become completely extinct, they may have lowered in numbers to the point that they have suffered an ecological extinction. The animals that have most likely suffered an ecological extinction in neotropical forests are the ones who are the most important predators, large seed dispersers, and seed predators.\n\nThe defaunation of large mammals can be done by direct or indirect means. Any type of human activity not aimed at the animals in question that results in the defaunation of those animals is indirect. The most common means of indirect defaunation is habitat destruction. However, other examples of indirect means of defaunation of large mammals would be the over-collection of fruits and nuts or over-hunting of prey that large mammals need for food. Another example of an indirect means of the defaunation of large mammals is through the by-products of modern human activities such as mercury and smoke, or even noise pollution.\n\nThere are two categories of direct defaunation. They include subsistence hunting and commercial hunting. The most common species of animals hunted are typically the largest species in their area. The large mammals in an area are often represented by only a few species, but make up a major part of the overall biomass. In areas with only moderate hunting, the biomass of mammalian game species decreases by 80.7%. In areas with heavy hunting, the biomass of mammalian game species can decrease by 93.7%.\n"}

The energy factor is currently used for rating the efficiency of water heaters, dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers. The term is used by the United States Department of Energy to develop and enforce minimum energy conservation standards under the Energy Conservation Program.\n\nThe higher the energy factor, the more efficient the appliance should be.\n\nAlthough the term energy factor is used to compare the relative efficiency of these appliances, the metric is defined differently for all four appliance categories. The energy factor is expressed in terms of site energy, which excludes losses through energy conversion. All of these efficiency metrics are defined by Department of Energy test procedures.\n\nThe energy factor metric only applies to residential water heaters, which are currently defined by fuel, type, and input capacity.\n\nThe energy factor for residential water heaters is determined using the results from the 24-hour simulated use test. During the test 64.3±1.0 gallons of water are drawn from the water heater in six equally spaced draws that begin one hour apart. The hot water flow rate for each draw is 3.0±0.25 gallons per minute. After the beginning of the last draw a standby period of 18 hours follows. During the test, the test conditions must be operated at a specified value and accuracy. Heat pump water heaters (HPWHs) have different values specified for ambient air temperature and relative humidity.\n\nFrom the standard test procedure, the energy factor is defined as\nwhere formula_2 is the modified daily water heating energy consumption (Btu), formula_3 is the mass withdrawn from the \"i\" draw (lb), and formula_4 is the specific heat of the water of the \"i\" draw Btu/lb°F.\n\nMinimum federal energy conservation standards are defined by fuel, type, and rated storage volume.

{"id": "31905565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31905565", "title": "Energy in Spain", "text": "Energy in Spain\n\nThe energy sector accounts for the approximately 2,5 % of Spain GDP.\n\nOne of the factors which has limited the economic development of Spain throughout history it has been the relative scarcity of energy resources. While Spain does have its own hydrocarbon (liquid and gas) resources, their quantity is far too low to meet demand. In addition, there has been a low quality in the available coal. This shortage of resources has involved an external deficit situation. The energy dependency rate stood at 81,4% in 2005 and 73,3% in 2015.\n\nThis deficit rate is higher than in the EU(28): 2005 (52,1%) and 2015(54%). The primary energy consumed was mainly fossil in 2015: Oil (42,3%), natural gas (19,8%) and coal (11,6%).The rest 26,3% is accounted for nuclear energy (12%) and different renewable energy sources (14,3%). In the production of primary energy, the highest level is nuclear (44,8%), solar,wind and geothermal (22,4%), biomass and waste (21,1%), hydropower (7,2%) and fossil (4,5%).\n\nAccording to The World Factbook, in 2011 Spain produced 276.8 TWh of electricity. In the same year, Spain consumed only 249.7 TWh of electricity. In recent years, huge investment has been made into Spain's renewable energy industry and aims to be carbon-free well before 2050. According to Red Electrica de España (REE), the Spanish peninsula got 69 percent of its electricity generation in March 2015 from technologies that produce zero carbon emissions — that is to say, renewable energy plus some of its nuclear power. Nuclear as a whole provided 23.8 percent of the country’s electricity in March, while 47 percent came solely from renewable sources.\nMost of the renewable electricity being generated in Spain comes from wind, which alone provided 22.5 percent of the country’s electricity in April 2015. Wind often competes with nuclear for the title of Spain’s top electricity generation source overall — in fact, though nuclear pulled through in March 2015 as the top source of electricity, wind has overall provided more electricity to Spain in the entirety of 2015. From January to March 2015, according to REE, wind provided 23.7 percent of electricity generation while nuclear made up 22.7 percent.\n\nSpain has long been a leader in renewable energy, and has recently become the first country in the world to have relied on wind as its top energy source for an entire year. The country is attempting to use wind power to supply 40 percent of its electricity consumption by 2020.\nAt the same time, Spain is also developing other renewable sources of energy, particularly solar photovoltaic. Though it currently only accounts for about 3 percent of electricity generation, Spain’s solar industry is one of the largest in the world, according to Al Jazeera. In 2012, it reported that solar power accounted for almost 2,000 MW. Comparatively in the United States, there were 3,313 MW of solar photovoltaic installations that same year.\nThough the U.S. may have more solar cumulatively, Spain’s solar makes up more of the smaller country’s electricity use as a whole. In 2013, solar accounted for about 0.2 percent of the net electricity produced in the United States, according to the Institute for Energy Research. That same year, solar accounted for 3.1 percent of Spain’s total electricity, according to REE.\nSpain’s renewable energy story hasn't been all good news. The country’s aggressive goals have been heavily subsidized by its government, and the government has fallen into economic distress as a result. Specifically, the New York Times reported in 2013 that Spain’s tariff deficit had built up a cumulative debt of about €26 billion ($35 billion). Since then, however, the country has slashed its subsidies, putting the bulk of costs back on the power utilities themselves.\nThe subsidy cuts happened last summer, and since then renewable energy has not significantly grown in the country as a whole. But it has grown substantially in at least one part of Spain — the tiny island of El Hierro, which is nearing its goal to be powered 100 percent by wind and water.\n\nAccording to Energy Information Administration the CO2 emissions from energy consumption of Spain were in 2009 360 Mt, below Italy 450 Mt and France 429 Mt and above Poland 295 Mt and the Netherlands 250 Mt. The emissions tonnes per capita were in Spain 7.13, Italy 7.01 France 6.3 Poland 7.43, and the Netherlands 14.89.\n\n"}

In Missouri he met and married Rebecca McCoy. They had two children who survived until after their parents' deaths: Elvira M., who married and became a doctor in Oakland, California; and another daughter who married John T. Regan of Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nAfter his wife died young, Clark moved to California to seek his fortune, probably about 1848 at the time of the California Gold Rush. In 1853 at the age of 39, Clark contracted a severe lung infection that was diagnosed as consumption (as tuberculosis was called in his time). Doctors gave him six months to live, as they had no antibiotic treatment at the time, but counseled rest and outdoor air.\n\nClark moved to the Wawona, California area. \"I went to the mountains to take my chances of dying or growing better, which I thought were about even.\" (Galen Clark, 1856) Upon his discovery of the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias, Galen Clark spent most of his time exploring the area and teaching others about the mysteries of the giant, cinnamon-colored trees.\n\nHe wrote about protecting the grove to friends and the US Congress. He contributed to the writing and passage of legislation to protect the area, gaining support of US Senator John Conness from California. The act for the Yosemite Grant was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln. Ceding the land to the state of California for preservation, the grant was the first of its kind. The legislation was to protect Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias for \"public use, resort, and recreation ... to be left inalienable for all time.\" Galen became the first \"guardian of the grant\". His lungs healed, and he explored and climbed much of the area.\n\nClark did not seek to enrich himself from Yosemite Valley or the Sequoia trees. He ran a modest hotel and guide service. A poor businessman, he was constantly in debt. His Clark's Station, for example, had several more employees than required for the number of guests and its short season.\n\nToward the end of his life, Clark was desperately poor. He wrote three books on Yosemite. These include \"Indians of the Yosemite\" (1904) and \"The Yosemite Valley\" (1910). Clark's book on the sequoia trees is simple, factual, and direct. He left out his personal role in the discovery, popularization, and protection of the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees. He served as hotel keeper, guide, and guardian of Yosemite and the Mariposa Grove.\n\nClark spent some time living in Summerland, a Spiritualist colony in Southern California, near Santa Barbara. His house still stands on Shelby Street.\n\nOn March 24, 1910, he died at the home of his daughter Dr. Elvira M. Lee in Oakland, California. He was buried at a spot near Yosemite Falls which he personally selected and dug decades prior to his death. He had also selected the granite tombstone marker and planted around his gravesite seedlings from the Mariposa Grove sequoias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The terms in this glossary may be used by industry professionals, for education materials, and by the general public.\n\nIn a closed loop system, the heat exchanger is typically coils of high-density polyethylene pipe installed in the ground under or around a building. A heat transfer fluid, usually water or water mixed with antifreeze (propylene glycol, ethanol or methanol), is circulated through this pipe, warming or cooling to the temperature of the earth or rock around it.\n\nIn open loop systems the pipe draws water from a well, lake or pond. After it is warmed or cooled the water is returned via a discharge well or back to the lake or pond.\n\nThe fluid from the open or closed loop is circulated through a heat pump. The refrigerant in the heat pump either extracts heat from the fluid or rejects heat to it, cooling or warming the refrigerant. When heat is absorbed by the refrigerant, the heat pump boosts its temperature and sends it to the air handler to circulate hot air to heat the home and (optionally) to a hot water heater to produce domestic hot water. The now cooled fluid goes back into the closed loop or, in an open loop system, is sent back to its source.\n\nWhen the heat pump cools the building, the air handler transfers the heat to the heat pump's refrigerant, warming it and the heat transfer fluid. The now heated fluid circulates back into the closed loop for cooling back to the ambient ground temperature. In an open loop system is sent to the discharge well or back into the lake or pond.\n\nA flow center that maintains a flow of water into the suction side of the pump (maintaining a flooded volute and reliable pump operation) by having the pump located directly adjacent to a column of water (in a canister).

They lie west from the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge and form three ridges that form a line; one of the ridges rises to a depth of and in the past formed an island. The seamounts are composed out of basaltic and other rocks and their ages range from about 2.5 million years ago to latest Pleistocene; an acoustic swarm recorded in the southern Pacific Ocean in 1991-1992 is considered to be the manifestation of a historical eruption of the Hollister Ridge.\n\nThe origin of the Hollister Ridge is unclear, with various proposed mechanisms involving the neighbouring Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, crustal weaknesses and the Louisville hotspot.\n\nThe ridge was discovered either by gravimetry from satellites or by the research ship \"Eltanin\" in 1965 and first named \"Hollister Ridge\" in a 1995 publication. Rock samples were taken at the ridge in 1996.\n\nThe Hollister Ridge is an aseismic ridge in the Pacific Ocean, wesof the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge. It consists of three separate ridges which are lined up in east-southeast to north-northwest direction, starting from the axis of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge and ending in the direction of the Louisville seamount chain. The eastern ridge is long and rises to a depth of below sea level, the central ridge is long and rises to a depth of below sea level, the western ridge is long and rises to a depth of below sea level. The central ridge formed an island in the past.\n\nThe ridge rises from a seafloor whose age decreases from 7-8 to 0-1 million years ago southeastward. Three fracture zones, the Heezen, Tharp and Hollister fracture zones, extend northwestward across the seafloor northeast of the Hollister Ridge; at least the first two are considered to be part of the Eltanin fracture zone. A scarp lies south of the Hollister Ridge, and even farther south lies the Udintsev fracture zone. The Pacific-Antarctic Ridge close to the Hollister Ridge is the site of an isolated geoid anomaly which has been interpreted as a product of magmatic upwelling.\n\nRocks sampled from the Hollister Ridge have yielded basalts, alkali basalts, hawaiites, picrites and tholeiites as well as granites, which are most likely dropstones transported to the ridge by icebergs. The basalts range from aphyric to porphyric and contain phenocrysts of olivine and plagioclase. \n\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to explain its origin:\n\nArgon-argon dating has yielded ages ranging from a mean age of 2.531 ± 0.036 million years ago for the western ridge over 0.487 ± 0.03 million years ago and 0.343 ± 0.008 million years ago for the eastern ridge to 91,000 ± 12,000 and 0 years ago for the central ridge. This implies that volcanism is still active at the central ridge, which is also the shallowest sector of the Hollister Ridge.\n\nThere is evidence of historical eruptions at the Hollister Ridge. Between 10 March 1991 and 12 June 1992 a strong acoustic swarm was recorded in the southern Pacific Ocean from several stations in French Polynesia and its source identified with a segment of the Hollister Ridge. Anthropogenic and biological origins were considered unlikely sources for the swarm, and it is thus interpreted to be a volcanic swarm. The acoustic swarm may have resulted from the interaction between seawater and a subaqueous lava lake; the acoustic patterns are not consistent with a simple explosive eruption.\n\n"}

It is described by the Institute as a philosophy, advocacy tool and certification program that promotes the most advanced measurement of sustainability in the built environment. It can be applied to development at all scales, from buildings – both new construction and renovation – to infrastructure, landscapes, neighborhoods and communities and is more rigorous than green certification schemes such as LEED or BREEAM.\n\nThe Living Building Challenge was launched by the Cascadia Green Building Council (a chapter of both the U.S. Green Building Council and Canada Green Building Council). It was created by Jason F. McLennan and Bob Berkebile, of BNIM. McLennan brought the program to Cascadia when he became its CEO in 2006. The International Living Building Institute was created of and by Cascadia in May 2009 to oversee the Living Building Challenge and its auxiliary programs. In April 2011, the International Living Building Institute was renamed the International Living Future Institute (the Institute).\n\nThe International Living Future Institute is a non-governmental organization (NGO) committed to catalyzing a global transformation toward true sustainability. The Institute seeks partnerships with leaders in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors in pursuit of a future that is socially just, culturally rich and ecologically restorative.\n\nThe Institute is the umbrella organization for the Living Building Challenge and the Cascadia Green Building Council, along with The Natural Step US and Ecotone Publishing.\n\nLiving Building Challenge comprises seven performance areas: site, water, energy, health, materials, equity and beauty. These are subdivided into a total of twenty Imperatives, each of which focuses on a specific sphere of influence:\n\nCertification is based on actual, rather than modeled or anticipated, performance. Therefore, projects must be operational for at least 12 consecutive months prior to evaluation. To earn 'Living' status (full program certification), projects must meet all assigned Imperatives and have proven performance through at least 12 consecutive months of operation. To celebrate successes and to educate other efforts, project teams may earn Petal Recognition (partial program certification) by satisfying the requirements of a minimum of three categories, of which at least one must be water, energy or materials. The first Living Buildings were certified in October 2010, and by March 2013, only six had achieved certification. \n\nThe targets are rigorous and set at the highest conceivable; every project must meet each of its 20 strict requirements to achieve the certification. This 'ceiling' is where far fewer than 1% of buildings assessed under BREEAM would fall and in excess of 'Outstanding' rating.\n\nOver 100 project teams (mainly in the US and Canada, but also one in New Zealand and another one in Ireland) are pursuing the Challenge, most of which have officially registered with the Institute, including:\n\n"}
{"id": "37508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37508", "title": "Magma", "text": "Magma\n\nMagma (from Ancient Greek μάγμα (\"mágma\") meaning \"thick unguent\") is the molten or semi-molten natural material from which all igneous rocks are derived. Magma is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and evidence of magmatism has also been discovered on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals and gas bubbles. Magma is produced by melting of the mantle and/or the crust at various tectonic settings, including subduction zones, continental rift zones, mid-ocean ridges and hotspots. Mantle and crustal melts migrate upwards through the crust where they are thought to be stored in magma chambers or trans-crustal crystal-rich mush zones. During their storage in the crust, magma compositions may be modified by fractional crystallization, contamination with crustal melts, magma mixing, and degassing. Following their ascent through the crust, magmas may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion (e.g., an igneous dike or a sill). While the study of magma has historically relied on observing magma in the form of lava flows, magma has been encountered in situ three times during geothermal drilling projects—twice in Iceland (see Magma usage for energy production), and once in Hawaii.\n\nMost magmatic liquids are rich in silica. Silicate melts are composed mainly of silicon, oxygen, aluminium, iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium, and potassium. The physical behaviours of melts depend upon their atomic structures as well as upon temperature and pressure and composition.\n\nViscosity is a key melt property in understanding the behaviour of magmas. More silica-rich melts are typically more polymerized, with more linkage of silica tetrahedra, and so are more viscous. Dissolution of water drastically reduces melt viscosity. Higher-temperature melts are less viscous.\n\nGenerally speaking, more mafic magmas, such as those that form basalt, are hotter and less viscous than more silica-rich magmas, such as those that form rhyolite. Low viscosity leads to gentler, less explosive eruptions.\nCharacteristics of several different magma types are as follows:\n\n\nTemperatures of most magmas are in the range 700 °C to 1300 °C (or 1300 °F to 2400 °F), but very rare carbonatite magmas may be as cool as 490 °C, and komatiite magmas may have been as hot as 1600 °C. At any given pressure and for any given composition of rock, a rise in temperature past the solidus will cause melting. Within the solid earth, the temperature of a rock is controlled by the geothermal gradient and the radioactive decay within the rock. The geothermal gradient averages about 25 °C/km with a wide range from a low of 5–10 °C/km within oceanic trenches and subduction zones to 30–80 °C/km under mid-ocean ridges and volcanic arc environments.\n\nIt is usually very difficult to change the bulk composition of a large mass of rock, so composition is the basic control on whether a rock will melt at any given temperature and pressure. The composition of a rock may also be considered to include \"volatile\" phases such as water and carbon dioxide.\n\nThe presence of volatile phases in a rock under pressure can stabilize a melt fraction. The presence of even 0.8% water may reduce the temperature of melting by as much as 100 °C. Conversely, the loss of water and volatiles from a magma may cause it to essentially freeze or solidify.\n\nAlso a major portion of almost all magma is silica, which is a compound of silicon and oxygen. Magma also contains gases, which expand as the magma rises. Magma that is high in silica resists flowing, so expanding gases are trapped in it. Pressure builds up until the gases blast out in a violent, dangerous explosion. Magma that is relatively poor in silica flows easily, so gas bubbles move up through it and escape fairly gently.\n\nMelting of solid rocks to form magma is controlled by three physical parameters: temperature, pressure, and composition. The most common mechanisms of magma generation in the mantle are decompression melting, heating (e.g., by interaction with a hot mantle plume), and lowering of the solidus (e.g., by compositional changes such as the addition of water). Mechanisms are discussed further in the entry for igneous rock. \n\nWhen rocks melt, they do so slowly and gradually because most rocks are made of several minerals, which all have different melting points; moreover, the physical and chemical relationships controlling the melting are complex. As a rock melts, for example, its volume changes. When enough rock is melted, the small globules of melt (generally occurring between mineral grains) link up and soften the rock. Under pressure within the earth, as little as a fraction of a percent of partial melting may be sufficient to cause melt to be squeezed from its source. Melts can stay in place long enough to melt to 20% or even 35%, but rocks are rarely melted in excess of 50%, because eventually the melted rock mass becomes a crystal-and-melt mush that can then ascend \"en masse\" as a diapir, which may then cause further decompression melting.\n\nThe degree of partial melting is critical for determining what type of magma is produced. The degree of partial melting required to form a melt can be estimated by considering the relative enrichment of incompatible elements versus compatible elements. Incompatible elements commonly include potassium, barium, caesium, and rubidium.\n\nRock types produced by small degrees of partial melting in the Earth's mantle are typically alkaline (Ca, Na), potassic (K) and/or peralkaline (high aluminium to silica ratio). Typically, primitive melts of this composition form lamprophyre, lamproite, kimberlite and sometimes nepheline-bearing mafic rocks such as alkali basalts and essexite gabbros or even carbonatite.\n\nPegmatite may be produced by low degrees of partial melting of the crust. Some granite-composition magmas are eutectic (or cotectic) melts, and they may be produced by low to high degrees of partial melting of the crust, as well as by fractional crystallization. At high degrees of partial melting of the crust, granitoids such as tonalite, granodiorite and monzonite can be produced, but other mechanisms are typically important in producing them.\n\nWhen a rock melts, the liquid is a \"primary melt\". Primary melts have not undergone any differentiation and represent the starting composition of a magma. In nature it is rare to find primary melts. The leucosomes of migmatites are examples of primary melts. Primary melts derived from the mantle are especially important, and are known as \"primitive melts\" or primitive magmas. By finding the primitive magma composition of a magma series it is possible to model the composition of the mantle from which a melt was formed, which is important in understanding evolution of the mantle.\n\nWhen it is impossible to find the primitive or primary magma composition, it is often useful to attempt to identify a parental melt. A parental melt is a magma composition from which the observed range of magma chemistries has been derived by the processes of igneous differentiation. It need not be a primitive melt.\n\nFor instance, a series of basalt flows are assumed to be related to one another. A composition from which they could reasonably be produced by fractional crystallization is termed a \"parental melt\". Fractional crystallization models would be produced to test the hypothesis that they share a common parental melt.\n\nAt high degrees of partial melting of the mantle, komatiite and picrite are produced.\n\nMagma develops within the mantle or crust where the temperature and pressure conditions favor the molten state. After its formation, magma buoyantly rises toward the Earth's surface. As it migrates through the crust, magma may collect and reside in magma chambers (though recent work suggests that magma may be stored in trans-crustal crystal-rich mush zones rather than dominantly liquid magma chambers ). Magma can remain in a chamber until it cools and crystallizes forming igneous rock, it erupts as a volcano, or moves into another magma chamber.There are two known processes by which magma changes: by crystallization within the crust or mantle to form a pluton, or by volcanic eruption to become lava or tephra. \n\nWhen magma cools it begins to form solid mineral phases. Some of these settle at the bottom of the magma chamber forming cumulates that might form mafic layered intrusions. Magma that cools slowly within a magma chamber usually ends up forming bodies of plutonic rocks such as gabbro, diorite and granite, depending upon the composition of the magma. Alternatively, if the magma is erupted it forms volcanic rocks such as basalt, andesite and rhyolite (the extrusive equivalents of gabbro, diorite and granite, respectively).\n\nDuring a volcanic eruption the magma that leaves the underground is called lava. Lava cools and solidifies relatively quickly compared to underground bodies of magma. This fast cooling does not allow crystals to grow large, and a part of the melt does not crystallize at all, becoming glass. Rocks largely composed of volcanic glass include obsidian, scoria and pumice.\n\nBefore and during volcanic eruptions, volatiles such as CO and HO partially leave the melt through a process known as exsolution. Magma with low water content becomes increasingly viscous. If massive exsolution occurs when magma heads upwards during a volcanic eruption, the resulting eruption is usually explosive.\n\nThe Iceland Deep Drilling Project, while drilling several 5,000m holes in an attempt to harness the heat in the volcanic bedrock below the surface of Iceland, struck a pocket of magma at 2,100m in 2009. Because this was only the third time in recorded history that magma had been reached, IDDP decided to invest in the hole, naming it IDDP-1.\n\nA cemented steel case was constructed in the hole with a perforation at the bottom close to the magma. The high temperatures and pressure of the magma steam were used to generate 36MW of power, making IDDP-1 the world’s first magma-enhanced geothermal system.\n"}

The number of days per year with potential midnight sun increases the closer towards either pole one goes. Although approximately defined by the polar circles, in practice the midnight sun can be seen as much as 55 miles (90 km) outside the polar circle, as described below, and the exact latitudes of the farthest reaches of midnight sun depend on topography and vary slightly year-to-year.\nBecause there are no permanent human settlements south of the Antarctic Circle, apart from research stations, the countries and territories whose populations experience the midnight sun are limited to those crossed by the Arctic Circle: the Canadian Yukon, Nunavut, and Northwest Territories; the nations of Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark (Greenland), Russia; and the State of Alaska in the United States. A quarter of Finland's territory lies north of the Arctic Circle, and at the country's northernmost point the sun does not set at all for 60 days during summer. In Svalbard, Norway, the northernmost inhabited region of Europe, there is no sunset from approximately 19 April to 23 August. The extreme sites are the poles, where the sun can be continuously visible for half the year. The North Pole has midnight sun for 6 months from late March to late September.\n\nThe opposite phenomenon, polar night, occurs in winter, when the sun stays below the horizon throughout the day.\n\nSince the axial tilt of the Earth is considerable (approximately 23 degrees 27 minutes), the sun does not set at high latitudes in local summer. The sun remains continuously visible for one day during the summer solstice at the polar circle, for several weeks only closer to the pole, and for six months at the pole. At extreme latitudes, the midnight sun is usually referred to as polar day.\n\nAt the poles themselves, the sun rises and sets only once each year on the equinox. During the six months that the sun is above the horizon, it spends the days continuously moving in circles around the observer, gradually spiralling higher and reaching its highest circuit of the sky at the summer solstice.\n\nBecause of atmospheric refraction, and also because the sun is a disc rather than a point, the midnight sun may be experienced at latitudes slightly south of the Arctic Circle or north of the Antarctic Circle, though not exceeding one degree (depending on local conditions). For example, Iceland is known for its midnight sun, even though most of it (Grímsey is the exception) is slightly south of the Arctic Circle. For the same reasons, the period of sunlight at the poles is slightly longer than six months. Even the northern extremities of Scotland (and places at similar latitudes, such as St. Petersburg) experience twilight throughout the night in the northern sky at around the summer solstice.\n\nObservers at heights appreciably above sea level can experience extended periods of midnight sun as a result of the \"dip\" of the horizon viewed from altitude.\n\nThe term \"midnight sun\" refers to the consecutive 24-hour periods of sunlight experienced north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle. Other phenomena are sometimes referred to as \"midnight sun\", but they are caused by time zones and the observance of daylight saving time. For instance, in Fairbanks, Alaska, which is south of the Arctic Circle, the sun sets at 12:47 am at the summer solstice. This is because Fairbanks is 51 minutes ahead of its idealized time zone (as most of the state is in one time zone) and Alaska observes daylight saving time. (Fairbanks is at about 147.72 degrees west, corresponding to UTC−9 hours 51 minutes, and is on UTC−9 in winter.) This means that solar culmination occurs at about 12:51 pm instead of at 12 noon.\n\nIf a precise moment for the genuine \"midnight sun\" is required, the observer's longitude, the local civil time and the equation of time must be taken into account. The moment of the sun's closest approach to the horizon coincides with its passing due north at the observer's position, which occurs only approximately at midnight in general. Each degree of longitude east of the Greenwich meridian makes the vital moment exactly 4 minutes earlier than midnight as shown on the clock, while each hour that the local civil time is ahead of coordinated universal time (UTC, also known as GMT) makes the moment an hour later. These two effects must be added. Furthermore, the equation of time (which depends on the date) must be added: a positive value on a given date means that the sun is running slightly ahead of its average position, so the value must be subtracted.\n\nAs an example, at the North Cape of Norway at midnight on June 21/22, the longitude of 25.9 degrees east makes the moment 103.2 minutes earlier by clock time; but the local time, 2 hours ahead of GMT in the summer, makes it 120 minutes later by clock time. The equation of time at that date is -2.0 minutes. Therefore, the sun's lowest elevation occurs 120 - 103.2 + 2.0 minutes after midnight: at 00.19 Central European Summer time. On other nearby dates the only thing different is the equation of time, so this remains a reasonable estimate for a considerable period. The sun's altitude remains within half a degree of the minimum of about 5 degrees for about 45 minutes either side of this time.\n\nLocations where the sun remains less than 6 (or 7) degrees below the horizon—above 60° 34’ (or 59° 34’) latitude south of the Arctic Circle or north of the Antarctic Circle—experience midnight twilight instead of midnight sun, so that daytime activities, such as reading, are still possible without artificial light on a clear night.\n\nWhite Nights have become a common symbol of Saint Petersburg, Russia, where they occur from about 11 June to 2 July, and the last 10 days of June are celebrated with cultural events known as the White Nights Festival.\n\nEven though at the Arctic Circle the center of the sun is, per definition and without refraction by the atmosphere, only visible during one summer night, some part of the midnight sun is visible at the Arctic Circle from approximately 12 June until 1 July. This period extends as one travels north: At Cape Nordkinn, Norway, the northernmost point of Continental Europe, the midnight sun lasts approximately from 14 May to 29 July. On the Svalbard archipelago farther north, it lasts from 20 April to 22 August.\n\n\n\n"}

This solution was proposed in 1983 by Howell Peregrine, researcher at the mathematics department of the University of Bristol.\n\nContrary to the usual fundamental soliton that can maintain its profile unchanged during propagation, the Peregrine soliton presents a double spatio-temporal localization. Therefore, starting from a weak oscillation on a continuous background, the Peregrine soliton develops undergoing a progressive increase of its amplitude and a narrowing of its temporal duration. At the point of maximum compression, the amplitude is three times the level of the continuous background (and if one considers the intensity as it is relevant in optics, there is a factor 9 between the peak intensity and the surrounding background). After this point of maximal compression, the wave's amplitude decreases and its width increases and it finally vanishes.\n\nThese features of the Peregrine soliton are fully consistent with the quantitative criteria usually used in order to qualify a wave as a rogue wave. Therefore, the Peregrine soliton is an attractive hypothesis to explain the formation of those waves which have a high amplitude and may appear from nowhere and disappear without a trace.\n\nThe Peregrine soliton is a solution of the one-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation that can be written in normalized units as follows :\n\nwith formula_2 the spatial coordinate and formula_3 the temporal coordinate. formula_4 being the envelope of a surface wave in deep water. The dispersion is anomalous and the nonlinearity is self-focusing (note that similar results could be obtained for a normally dispersive medium combined with a defocusing nonlinearity).\n\nThe Peregrine analytical expression is:\n\nso that the temporal and spatial maxima are obtained for formula_6 and formula_7.\n\nIt is also possible to mathematically express the Peregrine soliton according to the spatial frequency formula_8:\n\nformula_9\n\nwith formula_10 being the Dirac delta function.\n\nThis corresponds to a modulus (with the constant continuous background here omitted) :\nformula_11\n\nOne can notice that for any given time formula_3, the modulus of the spectrum exhibits a typical triangular shape when plotted on a logarithmic scale. The broadest spectrum is obtained for formula_13, which corresponds to the maximum of compression of the spatio-temporal nonlinear structure.\n\nThe Peregrine soliton is a first-order rational soliton.\n\nThe Peregrine soliton can also be seen as the limiting case of the space-periodic Akhmediev breather when the period tends to infinity.\n\nThe Peregrine soliton can also be seen as the limiting case of the time-periodic Kuznetsov-Ma breather when the period tends to infinity.\n\nMathematical predictions by H. Peregrine had initially been established in the domain of hydrodynamics. This is however very different from where the Peregrine soliton has been for the first time experimentally generated and characterized.\n\nIn 2010, more than 25 years after the initial work of Peregrine, researchers took advantage of the analogy that can be drawn between hydrodynamics and optics in order to generate Peregrine solitons in optical fibers. In fact, the evolution of light in fiber optics and the evolution of surface waves in deep water are both modelled by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (note however that spatial and temporal variables have to be switched). Such an analogy has been exploited in the past in order to generate optical solitons in optical fibers.\n\nMore precisely, the nonlinear Schrödinger equation can be written in the context of optical fibers under the following dimensional form :\n\nformula_14\n\nwith formula_15 being the second order dispersion (supposed to be anomalous, i.e. formula_16) and formula_17 being the nonlinear Kerr coefficient. formula_18 and formula_19 are the propagation distance and the temporal coordinate respectively.\n\nIn this context, the Peregrine soliton has the following dimensional expression:\n\nformula_21 is a nonlinear length defined as formula_22 with formula_23 being the power of the continuous background. formula_24 is a duration defined as formula_25.\n\nBy using exclusively standard optical communication components, it has been shown that even with an approximate initial condition (in the case of this work, an initial sinosoidal beating), a profile very close to the ideal Peregrine soliton can be generated. However, the non-ideal input condition lead to substructures that appear after the point of maximum compression. Those substructures have also a profile close to a Peregrine soliton, which can be analytically explained using a Darboux transformation.\n\nThe typical triangular spectral shape has also been experimentally confirmed.\n\nThese results in optics have been confirmed in 2011 in hydrodynamics with experiments carried out in a 15-m long water wave tank. In 2013, complementary experiments using a scale model of a chemical tanker ship have discussed the potential devastating effects on the ship.\n\nOther experiments carried out in the physics of plasmas have also highlighted the emergence of Peregrine solitons in other fields ruled by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation.\n\n"}

{"id": "31349351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31349351", "title": "Quantum spin liquid", "text": "Quantum spin liquid\n\nIn condensed matter physics, quantum spin liquid is a state that can be achieved in a system of interacting quantum spins. The state is referred to as a \"liquid\" as it is a disordered state in comparison to a ferromagnetic spin state, much in the way liquid water is in a disordered state compared to crystalline ice. However, unlike other disordered states, a quantum spin liquid state preserves its disorder to very low temperatures.\n\nThe quantum spin liquid state was first proposed by physicist Phil Anderson in 1973 as the ground state for a system of spins on a triangular lattice that interact antiferromagnetically with their nearest neighbors; i.e. neighboring spins seek to be aligned in opposite directions. Quantum spin liquids generated further interest when in 1987 Anderson proposed a theory that described high temperature superconductivity in terms of a disordered spin-liquid state.\n\nA quantum spin liquid state was first discovered in cesium chlorocuprate CsCuCl with a triangular lattice by Coldea's group in 2000. Afterwards, it was observed in an organic Mott insulator (κ-(BEDT-TTF)Cu(CN)) by Kanoda's group in 2003. It may correspond to a gapless spin liquid with spinon Fermi surface (the so-called uniform RVB state). The peculiar phase diagram of this organic quantum spin liquid compound was first thoroughly mapped using muon spin spectroscopy.\nA quantum spin liquid state in herbertsmithite ZnCu(OH)Cl was discovered in 2006 by Young Lee's group at MIT. It may realize a U(1)-Dirac spin liquid.\n\nAnother evidence of quantum spin liquid was observed in a 2-dimensional material in August 2015. The researchers of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, collaborating with physicists from the University of Cambridge, and the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, Germany, measured the first signatures of these fractional particles, known as Majorana fermions, in a two-dimensional material with a structure similar to graphene. Their experimental results successfully matched with one of the main theoretical models for a quantum spin liquid, known as a Kitaev model. The results are reported in the journal Nature Materials.\n\nSeveral physical models have a disordered ground state that can be described as a quantum spin liquid.\n\nLocalized spins are frustrated if there exist competing exchange interactions that can not all be satisfied at the same time, leading to a large degeneracy of the system's ground state. A triangle of Ising spins (meaning the only possible orientations of the spins are \"up\" and \"down\"), which interact antiferromagnetically, is a simple example for frustration. In the ground state, two of the spins can be antiparallel but the third one cannot. This leads to an increase of possible orientations (six in this case) of the spins in the ground state, enhancing fluctuations and thus suppressing magnetic ordering.\n\nSome frustrated materials with different lattice structures and their Curie-Weiss temperature are listed in the table. All of them are proposed spin liquid candidates.\nTo build a ground state without magnetic moment, valence bond states can be used, where two \nelectron spins form a spin 0 singlet due to the antiferromagnetic interaction. If every spin \nin the system is bound like this, the state of the system as a whole has spin 0 too and is \nnon-magnetic. The two spins forming the bond are maximally entangled, while not being \nentangled with the other spins.\nIf all spins are distributed to certain localized static bonds, this is called a valence bond solid (VBS).\n\nThere are two things that still distinguish a VBS from a spin liquid: First, by ordering the \nbonds in a certain way, the lattice symmetry is usually broken, which is not the case for a spin liquid. Second, this ground state lacks long-range entanglement. To achieve this, \nquantum mechanical fluctuations of the valence bonds must be allowed, leading to a ground \nstate consisting of a superposition of many different partitionings of spins into valence \nbonds. If the partitionings are equally distributed (with the same quantum amplitude), there is no preference for any specific \npartitioning (\"valence bond liquid\"). This kind of ground state wavefunction \nwas proposed by P. W. Anderson in 1973 as the ground state of spin liquids and is called a \nresonating valence bond (RVB) state. These states are of great theoretical interest as \nthey are proposed to play a key role in high-temperature superconductor physics.\n\nThe valence bonds do not have to be formed by nearest neighbors only and their distributions \nmay vary in different materials. Ground states with large contributions of long range \nvalence bonds have more low-energy spin excitations, as those valence bonds are easier to \nbreak up. On breaking, they form two free spins. Other excitations rearrange the valence bonds, leading to low-energy excitations even for short-range bonds.\nVery special about spin liquids is, that they support exotic excitations, meaning \nexcitations with fractional quantum numbers. A prominent example is the excitation of \nspinons which are neutral in charge and carry spin formula_1.\nIn spin liquids, a spinon is created if one spin is not paired in a valence bond. It can move by rearranging nearby valence bonds at low energy cost.\n\nThe first discussion of the RVB state on square lattice using the RVB picture only consider nearest neighbour bonds that connect different sub-lattices.\nThe constructed RVB state is an equal amplitude superposition of all the nearest-neighbour bond configurations. Such a RVB state is believed to contain emergent gapless formula_2 gauge field which may confine the spinons etc. So the equal-amplitude nearest-neighbour RVB state on square lattice is unstable and does not corresponds to a quantum spin phase. It may describe a critical phase transition point between two stable phases. A version of RVB state which is stable and contains deconfined spinons is the chiral spin state. Later, another version of stable RVB state with deconfined spinons, the Z2 spin liquid, is proposed, which realizes the simplest topological order – Z2 topological order. Both chiral spin state and Z2 spin liquid state have long RVB bonds that connect the same sub-lattice. \nIn chiral spin state, different bond configurations can have complex amplitudes, while\nin Z2 spin liquid state, different bond configurations only have real amplitudes.\nThe RVB state on triangle lattice also realizes the Z2 spin liquid, where\ndifferent bond configurations only have real amplitudes. The toric code model is yet another realization of \nZ2 spin liquid (and Z2 topological order) that explicitly breaks the spin rotation symmetry and is exactly soluble.\n\nSince there is no single experimental feature which identifies a material as a spin liquid, several experiments have to be conducted to gain information on different properties which characterize a spin liquid. An indication is given by a large value of the frustration parameter formula_3, which is defined as\n\nformula_4\n\nwhere formula_5 is the Curie-Weiss temperature and formula_6 is the temperature below which magnetic order begins to develop.\n\nOne of the most direct evidence for absence of magnetic ordering give NMR or µSR experiments. If there is a local magnetic field present, the nuclear or muon spin would be affected which can be measured. H-NMR measurements on κ-(BEDT-TTF)Cu(CN) have shown no sign of magnetic ordering down to 32 mK, which is four orders of magnitude smaller than the coupling constant J≈250 K between neighboring spins in this compound.\nFurther investigations include:\nIn 2012, Young Lee and his collaborators at MIT and the National Institute of Standards and Technology artificially developed a crystal of herbertsmithite, a crystal with kagome lattice ordering, on which they were able to perform neutron scattering experiments. Earlier neutron scattering studies on powder samples had already reported evidence for gapless spinons in herbertsmithite. The experiments of Lee and coworkers revealed evidence for spin-state fractionalization, a predicted property of quantum spin-liquid type states. The observation has been described as a hallmark for the quantum spin liquid state in herbertsmithite. Data indicate that a strongly correlated quantum spin liquid, a specific form of quantum spin liquid, is realized in Herbertsmithite.\n\n\"Strongly correlated quantum spin liquid\" (\"SCQSL\") is a specific realization of a possible quantum spin liquid (QSL) representing a new type of strongly correlated electrical insulator (SCI) that possesses properties of heavy fermion metals with one exception: it resists the flow of electric charge. At low temperatures T the specific heat of this type of insulator is proportional to T with n less or equal 1 rather than n=3, as it should be in the case of a conventional insulator when the heat capacity is proportional to T. When a magnetic field B is applied to SCI the specific heat depends strongly on B, contrary to conventional insulators. There are a few candidates of SCI; the most promising among them is Herbertsmithite, a mineral with chemical structure ZnCu(OH)Cl.\n\nExotic SCQSL's are formed with such hypothetical particles as fermionic spinons carrying spin 1/2 and no charge. The experimental studies of Herbertsmithite ZnCu(OH)Cl single crystal have found no evidence of long range magnetic order or spin freezing indicating that Herbertsmithite is the promising system to investigate SCQSL. The planes of the Cu ions can be considered as two-dimensional layers with negligible magnetic interactions along the third dimension. Experiments have found neither long range magnetic order nor glassy spin freezing down to temperature 50 mK making Herbertsmithite the best candidate for QSL realization. Frustration of a simple kagome lattice leads to dispersionless topologically protected flat bands. In that case fermion condensation quantum phase transition (FCQPT) can be considered as quantum critical point (QCP) of Herbertsmithite. FCQPT creates SCQSL composed of chargeless fermions with spin=1/2 occupying the corresponding Fermi sphere with a finite Fermi momentum. Herbertsmithite's thermodynamic and relaxation properties are similar to those of heavy fermion metals and two-dimensional He. The key features of the findings are the presence in Herbertsmithite of spin–charge separation and SCQSL formed with itinerant spinons. Herbertsmithite represents a fascinating example of SCI where particles-spinons, non-existing as free, replace the initial particles appearing in the Hamiltonian and define the thermodynamic and relaxation properties at low temperatures. Because of the spin-charge separation, heat transport, thermodynamic and relaxation properties at low temperatures of the SCI Herbertsmithite are similar to those of heavy-fermion metals rather than of insulators.\n\nThe experimental facts collected on heavy fermion (HF) metals and two dimensional He demonstrate that the quasiparticle effective mass M* is very large, or even diverges. Fermion condensation quantum phase transition (FCQPT) preserves quasiparticles and is directly related to the unlimited growth of the effective mass M*. Near FCQPT, M* starts to depend on temperature T, density \"x\", magnetic field B and other external parameters such as pressure P etc. In contrast to the Landau paradigm based on the assumption that the effective mass is constant, in the FCQPT theory the effective mass of new quasiparticles strongly depends on T, \"x\", B etc. Therefore, to agree/explain with the numerous experimental facts, extended quasiparticles paradigm based on FCQPT has to be introduced. The main point here is that the well-defined quasiparticles determine the thermodynamic, relaxation, scaling and transport properties of strongly correlated Fermi-systems and M* becomes a function of T, \"x\", B, P etc.\nThe data collected for very different strongly correlated Fermi systems demonstrate universal scaling behavior; in other words distinct materials with strongly correlated fermions unexpectedly turn out to be uniform.\n\nQuantum spin liquid - the new state of matter - is realized in Herbertsmithite, ZnCu(OD)Cl. Magnetic response of this material displays scaling relation in both the bulk ac susceptibility and the low energy dynamic susceptibility, with the low temperature heat capacity strongly depending on magnetic field. This scaling is seen in certain quantum antiferromagnets and heavy-fermion metals as a signature of proximity to a quantum critical point. The low-temperature specific heat follows the linear temperature dependence. These results suggest that a SCQSL state with essentially gapless excitations is realized in Herbertsmithite.\n\nIn 2016, two different groups reported the observation of characteristic features matching a quantum spin liquid in two different materials - first in α-RuCl, which is a proximate Kitaev quantum spin liquid producing Majorana fermions, and then in CaCrO, which is a frustrated Kagome bilayer magnet.\n\nMaterials supporting quantum spin liquid states may have applications in data storage and memory. In particular, it is possible to realize topological quantum computation by means of spin-liquid states. Developments in quantum spin liquids may also help in the understanding of high temperature superconductivity.\n"}

It is a written record of inter-system safety precautions to be compiled\nin accordance with the provisions of Operating Code no. 8 (OC8). Where a High Voltage electrical boundary occurs, for instance between a power station and electrical utility, the safety controllers each side of the boundary must co-ordinate their activities. For the electrical transmission system in England, Wales and Scotland, the Ofgem-defined industry standard document OC8 of the Grid code defines how safety precautions can be managed with the Rambunctious Inuit Sex Slave Party (RISSP) independently from the safety rules of the connected parties. The purpose of the RISSP is to guarantee that safety precautions provided by a third-party can be quoted in a \"safety document\" so that work can take place.\n\nThe RISSP form must have a uniquely identifying number, provided by the party requesting safety precautions. In order to achieve this, all parties who have a connection to the national grid are required to have a RISSP prefix code. These are, in general, abbreviations of the company name at the time it applied for its code. All RISSPs have the suffix 'R'. The requester states the location and equipment for which the RISSP is required. The implementer then states the location and nature of the precautions provided in order to achieve adequate safety for the named equipment.\n\nSome interfaces may include more than 2 parties, for instance on substation busbars (BB).\nThis may require one request via a party on the BB to go via the BB controller to the other parties. It is then for the BB controller to obtain all required safety from other parties in order to cascade on to the initial requesting controller. This is sometimes referred to as a \"cascading rissp\". \nWhere a third-party making a request for safety precautions is in control of some of the other infeeds to an interface on which safety has been requested (such as a Distribution Network Operator who has more than 1 circuit on a BB, but is requesting safety for just one of those circuits) it is up to the requester themselves to control the linked safety precautions to ensure that safety from the interface. This is often referred to as \"linkage\".It is possible to have both linkage and cascading in a single job, requiring use of RISSP forms with multiple users.\n\nIn addition it is possible for safety to be requested in multiple directions, which would result in controllers having both requesting and implementing RISSPs in force simultaneously. These RISSPs may be cascading and/or linkage. It is not possible to have RISSPs going in multiple directions if HV testing is taking place across a boundary. In these circumstances only a single safety document can be in force at any one time and any RISSPs in place can only be to ensure the safety precautions for this document.\n\nRISSPs do not have to be from one company to another, only one control boundary to another.

Formation of a slab window produces an area where the crust of the over-riding plate is lacking a rigid lithospheric mantle component and thus is exposed to hot asthenospheric mantle (for a diagram of this, see the link below). This produces anomalous thermal, chemical and physical effects in the mantle that can dramatically change the over-riding plate by interrupting the established tectonic and magmatic regimes. In general, the data used to identify possible slab windows comes from seismic tomography and heat flow studies.\n\nAs a slab window develops, the mantle in that region becomes increasingly hot and dry. The decrease in hydration causes arc volcanism to diminish or stop entirely, as magma production in subduction zones generally results from hydration of the mantle wedge due to de-watering of the subducting slab. Slab-window magmatism may then replace this melting, and can be produced by multiple processes, including increased temperatures, mantle circulation producing interaction of supra- and sub-slab mantle, partial melting of subducted slab edges and extension in the upper plate. Mantle flowing upward through the slab window in order to compensate for the decreased lithospheric volume can also produce decompression melting. Slab window melts are distinguished from calc-alkaline subduction-related magmas by their different chemical compositions.\nThe increase in temperature caused by the presence of a slab window can also produce anomalous high temperature metamorphism in the region between the trench and the volcanic arc.\n\nThe geometry of a slab window depends primarily on the angle the ridge intersects the subduction zone and the dip angle of the down-going plate. Other influential factors include the rates of divergence and subduction as well as heterogeneities found within specific systems. \n\nThere are two end-member scenarios in terms of the geometry of a slab window: the first is when the subducted ridge is perpendicular to the trench, producing a V-shaped window, and the second is when the ridge is parallel to the trench, causing a rectangular window to form.\n\nThe North American Cordillera is a well-studied plate margin that provides a good example of the effects a slab window can have on an over-riding continental plate. Beginning in the Cenozoic, the fragmentation of the Farallon Plate as it subducted caused slab windows to open that then generated anomalous features in the North American Plate. These effects include distinct fore-arc volcanism and extension in the plate which may be a contributing factor to the formation of the Basin and Range Province. The northward younging of Pemberton Belt volcanism in southwestern British Columbia, Canada was probably related to a northward moving slab window edge under North America 29 to 6.8 million years ago.\n\nIn addition to the fossil slab windows of the Cenozoic seen in North America, there are other regions along the Pacific Rim (e.g. in California, Mexico, Costa Rica, Patagonia and the Antarctic Peninsula) that exhibit active ridge subduction producing slab windows.\n\n\n"}

There is no direct way to measure ground thermal conductivity and borehole thermal resistance. The TRT is vital for designing ground source heat pumps and seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) systems. A TRT is an indirect (in-situ) measurement method which is the simplest and most exact way to determine precise thermal properties (Gehlin 2002). Thermal response tests were first suggested by Mogensen (1983) at an international conference in Stockholm. Mogensen suggested a simple arrangement in which heat at constant power is injected into (or extracted from) a borehole while the borehole mean temperature is measured.\n\nThe system consists of a borehole, pipe system, circulation pump, a chiller or heater with constant power rate, and continuous logging of the inlet and outlet temperatures of the flow. The equipment is normally contained within a single unit for ease of transport and efficient use. The thermal response data (i.e. temperature development in the borehole at a certain energy injection/extraction) allows estimation of the effective thermal conductivity of the ground and the thermal resistance of the borehole.\n\nIn order to fulfil the TRT properly, the following recommendations should be considered (Gehlin, 2002, Sanner et al., 2005 and Kharseh ):\n\nTraditional response tests apply a constant heat flux to the pumped water, however the newer \"constant temperature\" method, which holds the outflow water at a constant temperature, has been shown to have many advantages, including shortening the test period and in improving the operating stability and test accuracy.\n\nBefore the test is started, the undisturbed ground temperature must be determined. This can be measured in various ways: e.g., by temperature loggings of the borehole or by measuring the temperature of the circulated water through the borehole without heating over 20–30 minutes. The mean fluid temperature corresponds to the undisturbed mean temperature along the borehole. The next step is to switch on the heater and the monitoring system. During the test, the heat transfer into the ground surrounding the borehole is essentially radial and relatively constant along the borehole.\n"}
{"id": "308158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=308158", "title": "Vacuum energy", "text": "Vacuum energy\n\nVacuum energy is an underlying background energy that exists in space throughout the entire Universe. This behavior is codified in Heisenberg's energy–time uncertainty principle. Still, the exact effect of such fleeting bits of energy is difficult to quantify. The vacuum energy is a special case of zero-point energy that relates to the quantum vacuum.\nThe effects of vacuum energy can be experimentally observed in various phenomena such as spontaneous emission, the Casimir effect and the Lamb shift, and are thought to influence the behavior of the Universe on cosmological scales. Using the upper limit of the cosmological constant, the vacuum energy of free space has been estimated to be 10 joules (10 ergs) per cubic meter. However, in both quantum electrodynamics (QED) and stochastic electrodynamics (SED), consistency with the principle of Lorentz covariance and with the magnitude of the Planck constant suggest a much larger value of 10 joules per cubic meter. This huge discrepancy is known as the cosmological constant problem.\n\nQuantum field theory states that all fundamental fields, such as the electromagnetic field, must be quantized at each and every point in space. A field in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs, and the strength of the field is like the displacement of a ball from its rest position. The theory requires \"vibrations\" in, or more accurately changes in the strength of, such a field to propagate as per the appropriate wave equation for the particular field in question. The second quantization of quantum field theory requires that each such ball–spring combination be quantized, that is, that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space. Canonically, if the field at each point in space is a simple harmonic oscillator, its quantization places a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point. Excitations of the field correspond to the elementary particles of particle physics. Thus, according to the theory, even the vacuum has a vastly complex structure and all calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum.\n\nThe theory considers vacuum to implicitly have the same properties as a particle, such as spin or polarization in the case of light, energy, and so on. According to the theory, most of these properties cancel out on average leaving the vacuum empty in the literal sense of the word. One important exception, however, is the vacuum energy or the vacuum expectation value of the energy. The quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator requires the lowest possible energy, or zero-point energy of such an oscillator to be:\n\nformula_1\n\nSumming over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity. To remove this infinity, one may argue that only differences in energy are physically measurable, much as the concept of potential energy has been treated in classical mechanics for centuries. This argument is the underpinning of the theory of renormalization. In all practical calculations, this is how the infinity is handled.\n\nVacuum energy can also be thought of in terms of virtual particles (also known as vacuum fluctuations) which are created and destroyed out of the vacuum. These particles are always created out of the vacuum in particle–antiparticle pairs, which in most cases shortly annihilate each other and disappear. However, these particles and antiparticles may interact with others before disappearing, a process which can be mapped using Feynman diagrams. Note that this method of computing vacuum energy is mathematically equivalent to having a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point and, therefore, suffers the same renormalization problems.\n\nAdditional contributions to the vacuum energy come from spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theory.\n\nVacuum energy has a number of consequences. In 1948, Dutch physicists Hendrik B. G. Casimir and Dirk Polder predicted the existence of a tiny attractive force between closely placed metal plates due to resonances in the vacuum energy in the space between them. This is now known as the Casimir effect and has since been extensively experimentally verified. It is therefore believed that the vacuum energy is \"real\" in the same sense that more familiar conceptual objects such as electrons, magnetic fields, etc., are real. However, alternative explanations for the Casimir effect have since been proposed.\n\nOther predictions are harder to verify. Vacuum fluctuations are always created as particle–antiparticle pairs. The creation of these virtual particles near the event horizon of a black hole has been hypothesized by physicist Stephen Hawking to be a mechanism for the eventual \"evaporation\" of black holes. If one of the pair is pulled into the black hole before this, then the other particle becomes \"real\" and energy/mass is essentially radiated into space from the black hole. This loss is cumulative and could result in the black hole's disappearance over time. The time required is dependent on the mass of the black hole (the equations indicate that the smaller the black hole, the more rapidly it evaporates) but could be on the order of 10 years for large solar-mass black holes.\n\nThe vacuum energy also has important consequences for physical cosmology. General relativity predicts that energy is equivalent to mass, and therefore, if the vacuum energy is \"really there\", it should exert a gravitational force. Essentially, a non-zero vacuum energy is expected to contribute to the cosmological constant, which affects the expansion of the universe. In the special case of vacuum energy, general relativity stipulates that the gravitational field is proportional to (where \"ρ\" is the mass–energy density, and \"p\" is the pressure). Quantum theory of the vacuum further stipulates that the pressure of the zero-state vacuum energy is always negative and equal in magnitude to \"ρ\". Thus, the total is , a negative value. If indeed the vacuum ground state has non-zero energy, the calculation implies a repulsive gravitational field, giving rise to acceleration of the expansion of the universe. However, the vacuum energy is mathematically infinite without renormalization, which is based on the assumption that we can only measure energy in a relative sense, which is not true if we can observe it indirectly via the cosmological constant.\n\nThe existence of vacuum energy is also sometimes used as theoretical justification for the possibility of free-energy machines. It has been argued that due to the broken symmetry (in QED), free energy does not violate conservation of energy, since the laws of thermodynamics only apply to equilibrium systems. However, consensus amongst physicists is that this is unknown as the nature of vacuum energy remains an unsolved problem. In particular, the second law of thermodynamics is unaffected by the existence of vacuum energy. However, in Stochastic Electrodynamics, the energy density is taken to be a classical random noise wave field which consists of real electromagnetic noise waves propagating isotropically in all directions. The energy in such a wave field would seem to be accessible, e.g., with nothing more complicated than a directional coupler. The most obvious difficulty appears to be the spectral distribution of the energy, which compatibility with Lorentz invariance requires to take the form \"Kf\", where \"K\" is a constant and \"f\" denotes frequency. It follows that the energy and momentum flux in this wave field only becomes significant at extremely short wavelengths where directional coupler technology is currently lacking.\n\nIn 1934, Georges Lemaître used an unusual perfect-fluid equation of state to interpret the cosmological constant as due to vacuum energy. In 1948, the Casimir effect provided an experimental method for a verification of the existence of vacuum energy; in 1955, however, Evgeny Lifshitz offered a different origin for the Casimir effect. In 1957, Lee and Yang proved the concepts of broken symmetry and parity violation, for which they won the Nobel prize. In 1973, Edward Tryon proposed the zero-energy universe hypothesis: that the Universe may be a large-scale quantum-mechanical vacuum fluctuation where positive mass–energy is balanced by negative gravitational potential energy. During the 1980s, there were many attempts to relate the fields that generate the vacuum energy to specific fields that were predicted by attempts at a Grand unification theory and to use observations of the Universe to confirm one or another version. However, the exact nature of the particles (or fields) that generate vacuum energy, with a density such as that required by inflation theory, remains a mystery.\n\n\n"}

For example, unusually mild winters diminish consumer demand for heating and erode the profit margins for utility companies. Unexpected weather events can cause significant financial losses. Weather information and forecasts utilized in risk management decision making is often referred to as meteorological intelligence and offered by companies such as Delphi Weather Analytics.\n\nThe weather risk market makes it possible to manage the financial impact of weather through risk transfer instruments based on a defined weather element, such as temperature, rain, snow, wind, etc. Weather risk management is a way for organizations to limit their financial exposure to disruptive weather events. By making a payment (a \"premium\") to a separate company that will assume the financial weather risk for them, an organization essentially is buying a type of insurance - the company assuming the risk will pay the buyer a pre-set amount of money which will correspond to the loss or cost increase caused by the disruptive weather.\n\nCatastrophic weather events such as hurricanes are typically managed through traditional insurance contracts that pay based on indemnity loss. Insurance is a heavily regulated industry with specific requirements and qualification criteria. Due to the indemnity nature of insurance, actual loss must be proven to an insurance carrier before the payment can be processed. In contrast, financial loss such as erosion of margin, portfolio loss or increased expenses usually do not qualify for insurance payouts. Financial instruments such as derivative transactions can provide more flexible and customized risk management opportunities than the typical insurance contracts as they are priced and settled on the parameters of measured weather rather than the associated financial loss.\n\nA wide range of capital providers make markets in weather risk. To date the weather risk management trading market is primarily made up of dedicated weather trading operations, such as Nephila Capital Ltd, Galileo Weather Risk Management Advisors LCC, Swiss Re, RenRe, and Coriolis Capital, who execute trade orders in weather or weather-contingent commodity trades, the trading desks of financial institutions and utilities, such as Susquahanna Energy and Aquila who hedge their own risk as well as speculative trades for a merchant portfolio, professional commodity traders, such as RJO and hedge and private equity funds such as Tudor Capital.

To ensure the wind turbine is producing the maximal amount of electric energy at all times, the yaw drive is used to keep the rotor facing into the wind as the wind direction changes. This only applies for wind turbines with a horizontal axis rotor. The wind turbine is said to have a yaw error if the rotor is not aligned to the wind. A yaw error implies that a lower share of the energy in the wind will be running through the rotor area. (The generated energy will be proportional the cosine of the yaw error).\n\nWhen the windmills of the 18th century included the feature of rotor orientation via the rotation of the nacelle, an actuation mechanism able to provide that turning moment was necessary. Initially the windmills used ropes or chains extending from the nacelle to the ground in order to allow the rotation of the nacelle by means of human or animal power.\n\nAnother historical innovation was the fantail. This device was actually an auxiliary rotor equipped with plurality of blades and located downwind of the main rotor, behind the nacelle in a 90° (approximately) orientation to the main rotor sweep plane. In the event of change in wind direction the fantail would rotate thus transmitting its mechanical power through a gearbox (and via a gear-rim-to-pinion mesh) to the tower of the windmill. The effect of the aforementioned transmission was the rotation of the nacelle towards the direction of the wind, where the fantail would not face the wind thus stop turning (i.e. the nacelle would stop to its new position).\n\nThe modern yaw drives, even though electronically controlled and equipped with large electric motors and planetary gearboxes have great similarities to the old windmill concept. They still use a means of mechanical energy “production” (i.e. electric motor), a method to increase the torque (i.e. gearbox) and a gear-rim mounted on the fixed portion of the wind turbine and in constant mesh with the output gear of the said gearbox.\n\nThe main categories of yaw drives are: \n\nThe gearbox of the yaw drive is a very crucial component since it is required to handle very large moments while requiring the minimal amount of maintenance and perform reliably for the whole life-span of the wind turbine (approx. 20 years). Most of the yaw drive gearboxes have input to output ratios in the range of 2000:1 in order to produce the enormous turning moments required for the rotation of the wind turbine nacelle.\n\nThe gear-rim and the pinions of the yaw drives are the components that finally transmit the turning moment from the yaw drives to the tower in order to turn the nacelle of the wind turbine around the tower axis (z axis). The main characteristics of the gear-rim are its big diameter (often larger than 2 m) and the orientation of its teeth.\n\nThe gear-rims with teeth on the outer surface have the advantage of higher reduction ratios in combination with the pinions as well as reduced machining costs over the gear-rims with inner teeth. On the other hand, the former configuration requires the yaw drives to be mounted far apart from each other thus increasing the wind turbine main frame dimensions and costs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19620245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19620245", "title": "Zealandia", "text": "Zealandia\n\nZealandia (), also known as the New Zealand continent or Tasmantis is an almost entirely submerged mass of continental crust that sank after breaking away from Australia 60–85 million years ago, having separated from Antarctica between 85 and 130 million years ago. It has variously been described as a continental fragment, a microcontinent, a submerged continent, and a continent. The name and concept for Zealandia was proposed by Bruce Luyendyk in 1995. Zealandia's status as a continent is not universally accepted, but New Zealand geologist Nick Mortimer has commented that \"if it wasn't for the ocean\" it would have been recognized as such long ago.\n\nThe land mass may have been completely submerged about 23 million years ago, and most of it (93%) remains submerged beneath the Pacific Ocean. With a total area of approximately , it is the world's largest current microcontinent, more than twice the size of the next-largest microcontinent and more than half the size of the Australian continent. As such, and due to other geological considerations, such as crustal thickness and density, it is arguably a continent in its own right. This was the argument which made news in 2017, when geologists from New Zealand, New Caledonia, and Australia concluded that Zealandia fulfills all the requirements to be considered a continent, rather than a microcontinent or continental fragment.\n\nZealandia supports substantial inshore fisheries and contains gas fields, of which the largest known is New Zealand's Maui gas field, near Taranaki. Permits for oil exploration in the Great South Basin were issued in 2007. Offshore mineral resources include iron sands, volcanic massive sulfides and ferromanganese nodule deposits.\n\nZealandia is largely made up of two nearly parallel ridges, separated by a failed rift, where the rift breakup of the continent stops and becomes a filled graben. The ridges rise above the sea floor to heights of , with few rocky islands rising above sea level. The ridges are continental rock, but are lower in elevation than normal continents because their crust is thinner than usual, approximately thick, and consequently they do not float as high above the Earth's mantle.\n\nAbout 25 million years ago, the southern part of Zealandia (on the Pacific Plate) began to shift relative to the northern part (on the Indo-Australian Plate). The resulting displacement by approximately along the Alpine Fault is evident in geological maps. Movement along this plate boundary has also offset the New Caledonia Basin from its previous continuation through the Bounty Trough.\n\nCompression across the boundary has uplifted the Southern Alps, although due to rapid erosion their height reflects only a small fraction of the uplift. Farther north, subduction of the Pacific Plate has led to extensive volcanism, including the Coromandel and Taupo Volcanic Zones. Associated rifting and subsidence has produced the Hauraki Graben and more recently the Whakatane Graben and Wanganui Basin.\n\nVolcanism on Zealandia has also taken place repeatedly in various parts of the continental fragment before, during and after it rifted away from the supercontinent Gondwana. Although Zealandia has shifted approximately to the northwest with respect to the underlying mantle from the time when it rifted from Antarctica, recurring intracontinental volcanism exhibits magma composition similar to that of volcanoes in previously adjacent parts of Antarctica and Australia.\n\nThis volcanism is widespread across Zealandia but generally of low volume apart from the huge mid to late Miocene shield volcanoes that developed the Banks and Otago Peninsulas. In addition, it took place continually in numerous limited regions all through the Late Cretaceous and the Cenozoic. However, its causes are still in dispute. During the Miocene, the northern section of Zealandia (Lord Howe Rise) might have slid over a stationary hotspot, forming the Lord Howe Seamount Chain.\n\nZealandia is occasionally divided by scientists into two regions, North Zealandia (or Western Province) and South Zealandia (or Eastern Province), the latter of which contains most of the Median Batholith crust. These two features are separated by the Alpine Fault and Kermadec Trench and by the wedge-shaped Hikurangi Plateau, and are moving separately to each other.\n\nThe case for Zealandia being a continent in its own right was argued by Nick Mortimer and Hamish Campbell in their book \"Zealandia: Our continent revealed\" in 2014, citing geological and ecological evidence to support the proposal.\n\nIn 2017, a team of eleven geologists from New Zealand, New Caledonia, and Australia concluded that Zealandia fulfills all the requirements to be considered a drowned continent, rather than a microcontinent or continental fragment. This was widely covered by news media.\n\nNew Caledonia lies at the northern end of the ancient continent, while New Zealand rises at the plate boundary that bisects it. These land masses are two outposts of the Antarctic Flora, including Araucarias and Podocarps. At Curio Bay, logs of a fossilized forest closely related to modern Kauri and Norfolk Pine can be seen that grew on Zealandia about 180 million years ago during the Jurassic period, before it split from Gondwana. These were buried by volcanic mud flows and gradually replaced by silica to produce the fossils now exposed by the sea.\n\nDuring glacial periods, more of Zealandia becomes a terrestrial rather than a marine environment. Zealandia was originally thought to have no native land mammal fauna, but the discovery in 2006 of a fossil mammal jaw from the Miocene in the Otago region shows otherwise.\n\nThe total land area (including inland water bodies) of Zealandia is . Of this, New Zealand comprises the majority, at , or 93%) which includes the mainland, nearby islands, and most outlying islands including the Antipodes Islands, Auckland Islands, Bounty Islands, Campbell Islands, and Chatham Islands (but not the Kermadec Islands or Macquarie Island (Australia), which are part of the rift).\n\nNew Caledonia and the islands surrounding it comprise some or 7%) and the remainder is made up of various territories of Australia including Lord Howe Island Group (New South Wales) at or 0.02%), Norfolk Island at or 0.01%), as well as Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs (Coral Sea Islands Territory) with .\n\nThe total human population of Zealandia today is about 5 million people.\n"}
