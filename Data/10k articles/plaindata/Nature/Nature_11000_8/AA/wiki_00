{"id": "34962113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34962113", "title": "367943 Duende", "text": "367943 Duende\n\n367943 Duende, provisional designation , is a micro-asteroid and a near-Earth object of the Aten and Atira group, approximately in diameter. It was discovered by astronomers of the Astronomical Observatory of Mallorca at its robotic La Sagra Observatory in 2012, and named for the duende, a goblin-like creature from Iberian and Filipino mythology and folklore. \"Duende\" is likely an uncommon L-type asteroid and significantly elongated. For an asteroid of its size, it has a relatively long rotation period of 9.485 hours.\n\nOn 15 February 2013, \"Duende\" passed at a record distance of or 4.3 Earth radii from Earth's surface. Due to its close passage, the orbit of the former Apollo asteroid was significantly perturbed. \"Duende\" passage also coincided with the completely unrelated Chelyabinsk meteor, which entered Earth's atmosphere above Russia just 16 hours earlier.\n\n\"Duende\" was discovered on 23 February 2012, seven days after passing from Earth, by the La Sagra Observatory in Granada Province, Spain, using a 0.45-m reflector which was remotely operated by amateur astronomers at the Astronomical Observatory of Mallorca.\n\nThe still relatively imprecise orbit deduced from the short arc of the 2012 observations already made clear that Duende would pass no closer to Earth's surface than 3.2 Earth radii during its 2013 passage. There was at the time, however, a cumulative risk of 0.033% (1 in 3,030) that \"Duende\" would impact Earth during one of its 2026 to 2069 approaches.\n\nOn 9 January 2013, Duende was observed again by Las Campanas Observatory and the observation arc immediately increased from 79 days to 321 days. On 15 February 2013 at 19:25 Universal Time, Duende passed from the center of Earth, with an uncertainty region of about .\n\nIt passed above Earth's surface, closer than satellites in geosynchronous orbit. It briefly peaked at an apparent magnitude of roughly 7.2, a factor of a few fainter than would have been visible to the naked eye. The best observation location for the closest approach was Indonesia. Eastern Europe, Asia, and Australia also were well situated to observe Duende during its closest approach.\n\n\"Duende\" was not expected to pass any closer than 1950 km to any satellites. Goldstone Observatory observed Duende with radar from February 16 to February 20. Radar observations showed that is it an elongated asteroid with dimensions of . This gives Duende a geometric mean (spherical) diameter equivalent to .\n\nDuring the close approach an observational campaign involving 5 different telescopes in 4 different observatories was carried on in order to get information on the physical properties of this NEO.\n\nVisible and near-Infrared photometry, and visible spectroscopy were obtained at Gran Telescopio Canarias, Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and Calar Alto Observatory and put together. The classification using the M4AST online tool says this is an L-type asteroid. Those peculiar asteroids are characterized by a strongly reddish spectrum shortward of 0.8 μm, and a featureless flat spectrum longward of this, with little or no concave-up curvature related to a 1 μm silicon absorption band.\nTime-series photometry was also obtained in the Observatorio de La Hita () and Observatorio de Sierra Nevada during two consecutive nights (15–16 February 2013). All of this data were co-phased to build a lightcurve of the object. This lightcurve is double-peak and presents large variations in magnitude, implying a very elongated object, which is compatible with radar observations. The amplitude of the lightcurve yields an axial ratio that, together with the long axis of 40 m inferred from the radar images by Goldstone, results in an equivalent diameter of 18 m, much smaller than the estimations before the close-approach.\n\nThe rotational period was precisely determined from the lightcurve obtaining a value of 8.95 ± 0.08 h. This value is confirmed with an analysis of all the photometry of this objects reported to the Minor Planet Center. Using data pre and post close approach the authors find that the object suffered a spin-up during the event that decreased the rotational period from down to hours, which is compatible with the more accurate value estimated from the light-curve.\n\nThe close approach to Earth reduced the orbital period of Duende from 368 days to 317 days, Its aphelion was reduced from 1.110 to 0.9917 AU, leaving it almost entirely inside Earth's orbit and perturbing it from the Apollo class to the Aten class of near-Earth asteroids.\n\nIts next close approach to Earth will be on 15 February 2046 when it will pass about from Earth. Based on 7 radar observations, the next close approach to Earth similar to the 2013 passage will be on 16 February 2123 when Duende will pass no closer than from the center of Earth. For the 2123 passage, the nominal pass will be from the center of the Moon and then from the center of Earth.\nRisk assessments calculated before the 2013 passage were based on a diameter of 45 meters and a mass of 130,000 metric tons. It was estimated that, if it were ever to impact Earth, it would enter the atmosphere at a speed of 12.7 km/s, would have a kinetic energy equivalent to 2.4 megatons of TNT, and would produce an air burst with the equivalent of 2.1 megatons of TNT at an altitude of roughly . The Tunguska event has been estimated at 3–20 megatons. Asteroids of approximately 50 meters in diameter are expected to impact Earth once every 1200 years or so. Asteroids larger than 35 meters across can pose a threat to a town or city, and the Chelyabinsk meteor which serendipitously occurred on the day of the 2013 passage was due to a 17-meter asteroid. As a result of radar observations it is now known that Duende is only about 30 meters in diameter.\n\nThe table above uses Sentry's stony asteroid density of 2600 kg/m, Sentry's atmospheric entry velocity (V) of 12.7 km/s, and an angle of 45 degrees.\n\nFor kinetic energy at atmospheric entry, 3.3 Mt is equivalent to DF-4, 9 Mt is equivalent to Ivy Mike and 15.6 Mt is equivalent to Castle Bravo. For air burst energy, 530 kt is equivalent to W88 and 2.9 Mt is equivalent to R-12 Dvina.\n\nThis minor planet was named after the duende, fairy- or goblin-like mythological creatures from Iberian, Latin American and Filipino folklore. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center 17 November 2013 .\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12046339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12046339", "title": "Alex Shoumatoff", "text": "Alex Shoumatoff\n\nAlexander \"Alex\" Shoumatoff (born November 4, 1946) is an American writer known for his literary journalism, nature and environmental writing, and books and magazine pieces about political and environmental situations and world affairs. He was a staff writer at \"The New Yorker\" magazine from 1978 to 1987, a founding contributing editor of \"Outside\" magazine and \"Condé Nast Traveler\", and was the senior-most contributing editor to \"Vanity Fair\" since its re-inception in 1986 through 2015 before he pseudo retired. He is known for reporting from the most remote corners of the world.\n\nCareer highlights include Vanity Fair's article about Cornelius Gurlitt who was discovered with hundreds of paintings from art theft and looting during World War II from Nazi plundering; a 1986 article for \"Vanity Fair\" magazine about the mountain gorilla advocate Dian Fossey in 1986 in Rwanda which became the film \"Gorillas in the Mist\"; one of the first international articles about the Brazilian musician Caetano Veloso in 1984 for \"The New Yorker\"; tracing the origin of AIDS for Vanity Fair which became his book \"African Madness\"; a profile of the organization Product Red led by U2 front man Bono; and his arrest in 2008 for trespassing at the Bohemian Grove in Monte Rio, California in 2008 that was featured in Page 6 of \"The New York Post\" and \"Vanity Fair\" about how members of the Grove were attempting to log old-growth redwood trees, but became much more than that after news of his arrest was picked up by news outlets. \nHe has 10 published books and since 2001 has been the editor of a web site, \"Dispatches From The Vanishing World\", devoted to \"documenting and raising awareness about the planet's rapidly disappearing natural and cultural diversity\". Hundreds of pages of his writing are posted on the site. His eleventh book, The Wasting of Borneo: Dispatches From A Vanishing World,\" will be published by Beacon Press in April, 2017.\n\nShoumatoff has been called \"the greatest writer in America\" by Donald Trump and \"one of our greatest story tellers\" by Graydon Carter.\n\nShoumatoff descends from a family of the Russian nobility he traced back dozens of generations in his 1982 book, \"Russian Blood\". His paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Shoumatoff, was a prominent portrait artist who was painting President Franklin Roosevelt when he collapsed before her with a cerebral hemorrhage and she escorted his mistress Lucy Rutherford away from the scene before the media arrived. Her brother/Shoumatoff's great uncle Andrey Avinoff, was a \"gentleman-in-waiting\" to the Tsar at the time of the Soviet Revolution, was an artist also, and was a renowned lepidopterist who was fictionalized by Nabokov in Dar (The Gift) and became the director of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh from 1925 to 1945, and was profiled shortly before his death in 1948 by The New Yorker. His paternal grandfather, Leo Shoumatoff, was the business manager of Igor Sikorsky's aircraft company, which developed the helicopter and the first passenger airplane. His other grandfather was a Colonel in the Empress's cavalry guard. His father Nicholas Shoumatoff was an engineer who designed paper mills around the world, an entomologist, and well-known alpine ecologist who wrote the books \"Europe's Mountain Center\" and \"Around the Roof of the World,\" whose obituary was featured in the New York Times.\n\nShoumatoff was born in Mount Kisco, New York. He grew up in the 1950s in Bedford, New York, an exurban enclave of old-line WASPs that is now mostly inhabited by famous people and business leaders. He went to the local country-day school, Rippowam School, where he later taught middle-school science in his mid-twenties. Upon his graduation from the eighth grade, the family moved to London and began to spend summers in Switzerland's Bernese Oberland. His father, a passionate mountain climber, took Shoumatoff and his older brother Nick up major peaks in the Alps. When he was four, his parents put him in a summer camp in Gstaad, Switzerland, where he learned to speak French.\n\nShoumatoff did his secondary schooling at St. Paul's School, a then all-boys boarding school in Concord, New Hampshire, where he was at the top of his class and the captain of the squash team and was friends with, and eventually profiled in 1996, John Kerry. When he was 16, impressed with recordings by the South Carolina blues man Pink Anderson, he bought a guitar and wandered to the Folklore Center in Greenwich Village, New York, where Izzy Young sent him to Harlem to take lessons from the Reverend Gary Davis. Davis would have a huge impact on Shoumatoff and would become the subject of Shoumatoff's first published magazine piece.\n\nHe was admitted to Harvard University. He studied poetry writing with Robert Lowell in a class that included fellow literary journalist Tracy Kidder and was on the \"Harvard Lampoon\". His senior year roommates included Douglas Kenney, founder of National Lampoon and co-scriptor of Animal House and Caddyshack.\n\nGraduating at 1968 into the turbulence of the late Vietnam War and with influence from Bob Dylan, Shoumatoff aspired to be a songwriter. After a stint on the \"Washington Post\" as a night police reporter, and with a draft classification of I-A, he enlisted in an obscure Marine Corps reserve intelligence unit that trained him to be parachuted behind the Iron Curtain and to melt into the local population. He was given intensive Russian Language schooling in Monterey, California. There, however, he fell in with the psychedelic counterculture of the late 1960s. He turned to the Reverend Gary Davis with his predicament and Davis made him a minister in a heated moment in a store-front church in Harlem. This enabled him to get an honorable, IV-D discharge from the Marines (the D standing for Divinity).\n\nIn 1969, rather than returning to the Washington Post and becoming its Moscow correspondent, which the newspaper's editor Benjamin Bradlee had offered him, Shoumatoff chose to \"drop out\" with his girlfriend and they moved to an old farm in New Hampshire. He taught French at a local college and drove a school bus and became engrossed with nature. Breaking up with the girl that fall, he drifted to northern California hanging out on a succession of communes and playing music around bonfires and writing more songs. There, he sold his profile of Gary Davis to \"Rolling Stone\" and had a song-writing contract with Manny Greenhill, the manager of Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters, and Doc Watson. He went to New York City to perform his songs but ended up instead writing for magazines, starting with the \"Village Voice\". He developed a piece on Florida into his first book, \"Florida Ramble\", and married his editor's assistant. The newlyweds lived in the Marsh Sanctuary in Mount Kisco, where he became the resident naturalist. The marriage lasted only two years, and the heartbroken Shoumatoff, after turning in his second book, a natural and cultural history of Westchester County, New York, left for the Amazon Rainforest. There, he spent nine months, getting to a remote Yanomamo village that no one from the outside world had set foot in, and nearly dying of falciparum malaria. His second book on the experience,\"The Rivers Amazon\", was published by Sierra Club Press and was compared by reviewers with the classic exploration books on the Amazon by Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Walter Bates.\n\nReturning to Mount Kisco with a Brazilian wife, he learned that his Westchester book had been taken by \"The New Yorker\" and joined its staff in 1978. Shoumatoff established himself as \"consistently one of the farthest-flung of the New Yorker's far-flung correspondents\", as the \"New York Times\" described him, and he wrote pieces on pygmies in the Ituri Forest, lemurs of Madagascar, and traced the legend of Amazon women to a tributary of the Amazon called the Nhamunda, which no white person had visited since a Frenchman in 1890.\n\nShoumatoff is known for his style of \"long fact writing\" which was developed at The New Yorker under the editorship of William Shawn. Shawn encouraged his writers to pursue their interests in exhaustive detail, a practice used to provide comprehensive reporting about often little-known but fascinating and important subjects, and to fill the weekly magazine's pages. Shoumatoff began recording everything that he was told or observed or thought in little red Chinese and later Staples notebooks, and has filled 500 of them with 200,000 pages to date. To this day Shoumatoff attempts to give the best of his ability, \"the full picture, in all its complexity and ambiguity,\" and still submits very long pieces, much to the consternation of his magazine editors.\n\nMost of his books, beginning with \"Florida Ramble\", and continuing to his last published book, \"Legends of the American Desert\", are portraits of a place (a state, a county, a rainforest, a desert) and often originated with a magazine article. They identify and present, in a mixture of travelogue and exposition, elements that Shoumatoff believes make the place the way it is: flora and fauna; natural, cultural, and political history; local dialects and belief systems. His writing is often characterized by a fascination with \"the Other\", disenchantment with the modern consumer culture, and an insatiable quantity of detail that he developed at the New Yorker. The essayist Edward Hoagland described him as \"admirably protean, encyclopedic, and indefatigable, Shoumatoff has the curiosity of an army of researchers and writes like a house afire.\" Shoumatoff also appeals to, frequently works with, and his work often crosses with, work in cultural anthropology. He works often with specialists in species, cultures, and music.\n\nIn 1986 Shoumatoff wrote his first piece for \"Vanity Fair\", about the murder of Dian Fossey, which was made into the movie \"Gorillas in the Mist,\" and was considered to be one of the newly resurrected magazine's stars by then-editor Tina Brown. He wrote an account of the fall of Paraguay's dictator Alfredo Stroessner, which was the sole subject of Brown's introduction to the issue, and in l987 attempted to pinpoint the source of the AIDS virus in central Africa which he developed into the book \"African Madness\". In 1990, his book \"The World Is Burning\" about the murder of Chico Mendes was optioned by director/actor Robert Redford. In the early 1990s, he became interested in golf, and had a column in Esquire Magazine called \"Investigative Golf.\" Two of his more-famous pieces about golf were one in 1994 which former President Bill Clinton's golf buddies discussed rumors of Clinton's extra-marital affairs prior to the Monica Lewinsky scandal; and another piece about playing with O.J. Simpson's golf buddies who believed Simpson may have hidden the murder weapon in his golf bag. He also profiled Uma Thurman and her father, Buddhist Robert Thurman, for a cover feature in Vanity Fair. During this era, Shoumatoff appeared on the tabloid T.V. shows \"Inside Edition\" and \"E! True Hollywood Story\".\n\nIn 1997, his book \"Legends of the American Desert: Sojourns in the Greater Southwest\", (Knopf, 1997) was named a \"New York Times\" notable book and was on \"Time\" magazine and \"New York Post\"s top ten books of 1997. He wrote about global warming and the defeat of the USA's endorsement of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, In 2000, he was selected as the correspondent from \"Vanity Fair\" to profile Al Gore, whom he had gone to college with, before the election in a piece that was not published. In 2001, Shoumatoff strengthened his focus on the environment and an interest in creating a written record of these places and/or cultures and species, believing that many of the places that he had been writing about since the 1970s had been drastically changed by the West's appetite for goods, and started his web site, \"Dispatches From The Vanishing World\", with his son Andre.\n\nIn the late 2000s Shoumatoff recorded his first musical album with his longtime friend Kate McGarrigle, the mother of Rufus Wainwright and Martha Wainwright, that was featured on NPR's weekend edition of \"All Things Considered\" during the Pennsylvania primary for the 2008 primary election.\n\nShoumatoff has lived in Montreal since 1998 and is still active primarily with magazines such as Smithsonian and is active on speaker circuits about writing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1891348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891348", "title": "Alien Planet", "text": "Alien Planet\n\nAlien Planet is a 94-minute docufiction, originally airing on the Discovery Channel, about two internationally built robot probes searching for alien life on the fictional planet Darwin IV. It was based on the book \"Expedition\", by sci-fi/fantasy artist and writer Wayne Douglas Barlowe, who was also executive producer on the special. It premiered on May 14, 2005.\n\nThe show uses computer-generated imagery, which is interspersed with interviews from such notables as Stephen Hawking, George Lucas, Michio Kaku and Jack Horner. The show was filmed in Iceland and Mono Lake in California.\n\n\"Alien Planet\" starts out with an interstellar spacecraft named \"Von Braun\", leaving Earth's orbit. Traveling at 20% the speed of light (37,000 miles/s), it reaches Darwin IV in 42 years. Upon reaching orbit, it deploys the \"Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter\", which looks for potential landing sites for the probes. The first probe, \"Balboa,\" explodes along with its lifting body transport during entry, because one of its wings failed to unfold. Two backup probes, \"Leonardo da Vinci\" (nicknamed Leo) and \"Isaac Newton\" (nicknamed Ike), successfully land on the planet, and learn much about its bizarre indigenous lifeforms, including an apparently sapient species.\n\nThe robotic probes sent out to research on Darwin IV are called Horus Probes. Each Horus probe consists of an high, long inflatable, hydrogen-filled balloon, which is covered with solar receptors, a computer 'brain', a 'head' covered with sensors, and several smaller robots that can be sent to places too dangerous for the probes themselves. The probes have a limited degree of artificial intelligence, very similar to the 'processing power' of a 4-year-old. All the real thinking is done by a supercomputer in the orbiting \"Von Braun\". The probes are programmed with different personalities; Ike is more cautious, while Leo is the risk-taker. The two probes are also equipped with a holographic message that will be projected to any sentient life found on Darwin.\n\nAfter the two probes inflate their gas-bags, they encounter a voracious Arrowtongue and watch it pursue a Gyrosprinter. Later that night, the twins find the wreckage of Balboa and are ordered to split up, Ike studying the unique plant life and Leo going after big game. Ike's voyage takes him to one of Darwin IV's pocket forests, where he encounters a flock of Trunk Suckers and their predator, the Daggerwrist. Before his research is finished, a massive hurricane-like storm hits and Ike must take to the sky, launching weather balloons. Leo goes to the mountain ranges and finds a herd of Unths engaged in rutting-like behavior.\n\nAfterward, Leo finds a pair of Bladderhorns engaging in combat. It tries to communicate with one, but a sonic ping interrupts the conversation and scares off the animal, and he is knocked out by a mysterious creature. Ike ventures to the meadows and gullies of Darwin IV, encountering massive Grovebacks and a herd of Littoralopes. Flying above, dangerous predators: the Skewers.\n\nLeo gets destroyed by a mysterious and evasive creature, and Ike, ordered by the \"Von Braun\" to search for Leo's attacker, hopes to find a new sentient species. Ike's route takes him across perilous terrain, and across the Amoebic Sea in its quest for Leo. As it embarks on its journey, one of the Grovebacks seen earlier falls victim to a swarm of Beach Quills. Ike then finds a pack of Prongheads hunting a Gyrosprinter, and crosses the Amoebic Sea (which attempted to attack Ike), encountering a herd of giant Sea Striders.\n\nIke manages to find Leo after a harrowing experience with a Skewer which tries to attack it, but is killed by a spear thrown by the newly discovered floating Eosapien. Shortly afterward, Ike communicates with the Eosapien tribe and discovers that they are truly intelligent. Ike launches a camera disk to record the moment, or perhaps \"to assess the threat\" due to a third Eosapien appearing; however one of the Eosapiens mistakes it as an attack and destroys the camera disk. Before shutting down, the wrecked camera disk records the Eosapien tribe carrying Ike away.\n\nCommentary from notable people discussing the details behind the fictional world of Darwin IV and the likelihood of extraterrestrial life in general is interspersed throughout the movie.\n\nThe following are the craft and probes that appear in the film:\n\nThe cruise speed of the Von Braun is 20% the speed of light. At this speed it reaches the planet Darwin IV in 42 years. The \"Von Braun\", named after Wernher von Braun, has two primary propulsion systems: nuclear ion engines for low-speed maneuvers during the first year of spaceflight and an antimatter catalyst to accelerate to 20% the speed of light. Once in orbit it deploys the \"Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter\" and the landing probes. It also has artificial intelligence computers to act as the central command for the mission. During the long cruise to Darwin IV, a metal-composite dust shield protects the spacecraft from interstellar debris. It is jettisoned before \"Von Braun\" brakes in orbit around Darwin IV. Finally, it has a diameter communications dish, deployed in orbit, for information transfer to Earth. It transfers a large amount of information via a laser beam at a frequency of 8 GHz in the X-band.\n\nThe Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter (DRO) was deployed in orbit around Darwin IV from the \"Von Braun\". The spacecraft has a mass of about 5,000 kilograms. Unlike the nuclear-powered \"Von Braun\", the DRO utilizes solar panels, capable of generating several megawatts for power. Its primary purpose was to look for potential landing sites for the Horus probes and to map the entire planet. After deployment, the DRO utilizes its own booster rocket to place it in the proper orbit. The DRO studied the planet for about 1 Darwin IV year (about 1.6 Earth years) to ensure the Horus probes would not land in unacceptable conditions. Instruments carried on the DRO include a synthetic aperture radar, a visible light camera, a near-infrared camera, and a spectrometer. The exact timing of the landings would be determined by computers in the \"Von Braun\" based on data from the DRO.\n\nThe Horus probes are used for the surface operations of the Darwin IV expedition. The \"Von Braun\" carries three probes. Each probe is essentially identical with the exception of their behavior and external color. Each probe is carried to the surface in a lifting body lander. The probes also have the intelligence on par with a 4 year old child.\n\nProbe Balboa, named after Vasco Núñez de Balboa, was the first probe launched to explore Darwin IV. However, it experienced a malfunction while the two small wings/fins were unfolding. When it entered Darwin IV's atmosphere, non-heat-resistant material which was exposed caught fire, leading to the breakup of the craft. If Probe Balboa's entry into Darwin IV atmosphere is watched carefully, it can be seen that the right wing/fin does not extend and lock into place. Probe Balboa was never given a nickname. It was the shortest lasting probe, since it was never activated. Its color is red.\n\nProbe Leo, named after Leonardo da Vinci, was the second probe to attempt landing on Darwin IV, which was a success. Leo was programmed to take risks and be adventurous, and study animal life. It explored the planet for several days before it went offline due to an Eosapien attack. It came back online momentarily, launching a camera disk, which disturbed the Eosapiens and provoked them to attack a second time. Leo never came back online. Its color is blue.\n\nProbe Ike, named after Isaac Newton, was the third and final probe to land. He was programmed to be more observational and avoid risks. His first objective was the study of plant life; but Ike encountered many more creatures in the process. After Leo went offline, the \"Von Braun\" commanded probe Newton to search for Leo and to take more risks studying animal life. On the way, Ike traveled some distance and discovered several new aliens. Upon arrival at Leo's final transmission site, Ike was almost killed by a Skewer, but was miraculously saved by an Eosapien's spear. It is unknown if this was simply pure luck, or, as a genuine form of extraterrestrial intelligence, if it willingly saved Ike's life. Ike then showed the Eosapien the Earth communication message. Ike was surrounded by Eosapiens and launched its sixth and last camera disk. The Eosapiens thought the camera disk was a threat and attacked it and possibly Ike, thus terminating surface operations of the mission. If an observer looks carefully, they can see that Ike is last seen being carried away by the Eosapien tribe and is presumed to have been destroyed, although his true fate is still debatable. It was the longest lasting probe on Darwin IV. Its color is yellow.\n\nThe Horus probes (Leo, Ike, and Balboa) carry mini-probes to venture into places too dangerous or too small for the Horus probes. The spiders and disks can be collected and recharged, while the balloons cannot.\n\nCamera disks are small, flying-saucer like disks that can be launched and fly at high speeds. The disks are equipped with two small cameras to record video. The disks were considered as threats by the Eosapiens (Probably because they see them as throwing weapons), and was the main culprit for the probe's destruction. Leo, Ike, and Balboa each have six of them.\n\nIke constantly launched camera disks to study life-forms.\n\nCamera disks 1, 5, and 6 from Ike were destroyed by native life. They were lost to - Daggerwrists (Because it \"wasn't interested in posing\"), Sea Striders (One stepped on the disk by accident), and Eosapiens (They mistook it for a threat for some reason, probably seeing it as throwing a weapon). One of Leo's camera disks was destroyed by an Eosapien (Again, because the disk was mistaken for a threat).\n\nGreen weather balloons are used to help Ike, Leo, and Balboa analyze the current weather conditions. They are built with a sensor that tells the Horus probes what is going on. They also have a small camera. Unlike the camera disks and spider probes, the weather balloons are not retrieved for re-use. It's unknown if any of them got destroyed by some force.\n\nThese robotic spiders are four-legged, and are used to help the Horus probes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "97046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97046", "title": "Atum", "text": "Atum\n\nAtum (, Egyptian: \"jtm(w)\" or \"tm(w);\" Coptic \"Atoum\"), sometimes rendered as Atem or Tem, is an important deity in Egyptian mythology.\n\nAtum's name is thought to be derived from the verb \"tm\" which means to complete or finish. Thus he has been interpreted as being the \"complete one\" and also the finisher of the world, which he returns to watery chaos at the end of the creative cycle. As creator he was seen as the underlying substance of the world, the deities and all things being made of his flesh or alternatively being his ka.\n\nAtum is one of the most important and frequently mentioned deities from earliest times, as evidenced by his prominence in the Pyramid Texts, where he is portrayed as both a creator and father to the king.\n\nIn the Heliopolitan creation myth, Atum was considered to be the first god, having created himself, sitting on a mound (benben) (or identified with the mound itself), from the primordial waters (Nu). Early myths state that Atum created the god Shu and goddess Tefnut by spitting them out of his mouth. To explain how Atum did this, the myth uses the metaphor of masturbation, with the hand he used in this act representing the female principle inherent within him. Other interpretations state that he has made union with his shadow.\n\nIn the Old Kingdom the Egyptians believed that Atum lifted the dead king's soul from his pyramid to the starry heavens. He was also a solar deity, associated with the primary sun god Ra. Atum was linked specifically with the evening sun, while Ra or the closely linked god Khepri were connected with the sun at morning and midday.\n\nIn the Book of the Dead, which was still current in the Graeco-Roman period, the sun god Atum is said to have ascended from chaos-waters with the appearance of a snake, the animal renewing itself every morning.\n\nAtum is the god of pre-existence and post-existence. In the binary solar cycle, the serpentine Atum is contrasted with the ram-headed scarab Khepri—the young sun god, whose name is derived from the Egyptian \"hpr\" \"to come into existence\". Khepri-Atum encompassed sunrise and sunset, thus reflecting the entire cycle of morning and evening.\n\nAtum was a self-created deity, the first being to emerge from the darkness and endless watery abyss that existed before creation. A product of the energy and matter contained in this chaos, he created his children—the first deities, out of loneliness. He produced from his own sneeze, or in some accounts, semen, Shu, the god of air, and Tefnut, the goddess of moisture. The brother and sister, curious about the primeval waters that surrounded them, went to explore the waters and disappeared into the darkness. Unable to bear his loss, Atum sent a fiery messenger, the Eye of Ra, to find his children. The tears of joy he shed on their return were the first human beings.\n\nAtum is usually depicted as a man wearing either the royal head-cloth or the dual white and red crown of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt, reinforcing his connection with kingship. Sometimes he also is shown as a serpent, the form he returns to at the end of the creative cycle, and also occasionally as a mongoose, lion, bull, lizard, or ape.\n\nAtum's worship centered on the city of Heliopolis (Egyptian: \"Annu\" or \"Iunu\"). The only surviving remnant of Heliopolis is the Temple of Re-Atum obelisk located in Al-Masalla of Al-Matariyyah, Cairo. It was erected by Senusret I of the Twelfth dynasty, and still stands in its original position. The high red granite obelisk weighs 120 tons (240,000 lbs, 108,900 kg), the weight of about 20 African elephants.\n"}

Its main usage is to determine the probabilities of a tornado inside a Tornadic Vortex Signature on the rear flank of a storm, to better alert potential high-risk areas for tornadoes and to easily track them.\n\nWith the help of NEXRAD weather radar data, mesoscale models and algorithms, the index is measured on a scale of 0 to 10. The higher the BTI value is, the more likely a tornado is on the ground. Shear markers from different colors are used depending on the scale above 2. Yellow markers are used for values between 2 and 3.9, Orange markers are used for values between 4 and 6.9 and red markers are used for values over 7.\n\nThe product was developed and is marketed by Baron Services of Huntsville, Alabama, and is a part of the company's VIPIR radar analysis product. The system is primarily used by television stations. The BTI first saw public usage in early 2008. WMC-TV, the NBC affiliate in Memphis, Tennessee was the first station to implement the BTI during the 2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak on February 5, 2008 when tracking tornadoes over the Memphis and Jackson areas.

The Aarhus River passes through Brabrand Lake and it is possible to canoe all the way to the inner city from here. The lake is oblong-shaped.\n\nSince 2003, Brabrand Lake has been steadily extended 3–4 km further west, with the new lake of Årslev Engsø (lit.: Årslev meadow-lake). In 2001–2, it was politically decided to abandon the artificial draining of the meadows and as of 2013, Årslev meadow lake has a surface area of around . The total area including adjoining meadows and reed beds totals . It is hoped that Eurasian bittern and otter will find themselves a new home here with time. In everyday parlance, \"Brabrand Lake\" is a general term including the surroundings as well, indicating a total area of around with for the lake alone.\n\nA special Natura2000 protected area under the European Union, Brabrand Lake is home to a large variety of birds and an important resting place for migrating birds, with several towers built to facilitate bird-watching. A public hiking trail surrounds the lake, whose landscape varies from wide meadows and reed beds to dense woods. Privately-owned pastures almost completely surround the lake and are not publicly accessible, but public paths leading to the lake are scattered in between. There are several garden allotments (\"kolonihaver\" in Danish) near Brabrand Lake and it is a popular recreational spot. It is a statutory goal of the Aarhus municipality to make the area publicly accessible and attractive to the public.\n\n\"Brabrandstien\" (lit.: the Brabrand pathway), which runs along the Aarhus river from the inner city and around both Brabrand Sø and Årslev Engsø, was established by the City Council in 1956 as a labor project for the unemployed, to give the public better access to green space. The pathway is c. 26 km long, with 9.5 km for Brabrand Lake alone. With the addition of Årslev Engsø, the pathway grew another 8 km. A large part of Brabrandstien is asphalted and is popular for cycling, rollerskating and jogging. Some of the graveled western parts are used for horseback riding. Cars are not allowed and motor vehicles are restricted. Brabrandstien is part of the Aarhus-Silkeborg hiking trail.\n\nOn the northern bank of Brabrand Lake lies the facilities of \"Brabrand Rostadion\" (Brabrand Rowing Stadium). The stadium was established in 1952 and was heavily renovated and rebuilt in the year 2010. C. F. Møller Architects was the architectural firm behind the new buildings. Local rowing and kayaking clubs have used the lake for practice and larger regattas for many years. \"Rocenter Aarhus RCA\" (Aarhus Rowing Center) is located here, offering qualified training for rowers and clubs in East and South Jutland on all levels (including elite) and for all ages. There is a 2,000 m racing track on Brabrand Lake and it is generally perceived as very good for outrigger racing, but other types of boats are also rowed here, including kayaks. \"Aarhus Roklub\" (Aarhus Rowing Club), based here, have scored several prestigious medals. In 2005, Maria Pertl won silver in the World Rowing Championships in collaboration with Juliane Elander Rasmussen. In 2011, Andrej Lawaetz Bendtsen won gold at the WRC for seniors in a team of four.\n\nThe lake is not very deep and has suffered from eutrophication for many years. The excessive nutrients originate from waste water and agricultural activities and pose a constant environmental threat to the surrounding ecology and the Bay of Aarhus. Eutrophication is a common problem all over the developed world. Starting in 1959 with 158 hectares, several environmental projects have aimed to alleviate the environmental burdens and at the same time maintain the aesthetic value of the lake and surrounding areas. These projects includes mud pumping of the lakebed and willow afforestations. Also, the local water company \"Aarhus Vand A/S\" began extracting phosphor from wastewater in 2013 at a water treatment plant in Åby close to the lake. Phosphor is a key element in the eutrophication process but a valuable resource on its own and the water treatment plant is among only a few in the world to engage with this. It is hoped that the rich fen ecology which formerly characterized the lake, and is a threatened nature-type in general, can be restored in the future. \n\nThe groundwater beneath and adjoining Brabrand Lake is very important, as it provides drinking water to more than 100,000 people in the greater Aarhus area. Acting partly on this fact, the lake water was also included in a large water treatment project led by \"Aarhus Vand A/S\" from 2006 to 2013. The project involved the Brabrand Lake, the Aarhus River and the Aarhus habour, budgeted at € 45 million. As a result, the waters in Brabrand Lake and the Aarhus River attained bathing quality in September 2012.\n\nMany species of flora and fauna at Brabrand Lake are either rare or relatively rare in Denmark and on the Danish Red List (under IUCN Red List). Some also are protected under different habitat directives of the EU. Here are a few examples:\n\nApart from these rarer species, the Brabrand Lake area is characterized by many common species living here, mostly birds, insects and aquatic plants.\n\nThe area around Brabrand Lake has been populated for at least 6,000 years. In prehistoric times, Brabrand Lake was part of a deep brackish water fjord, offering natural protection and food in abundance. There were archaeological excavations here as early as 1903, revealing early Stone Age settlements and activities from the Ertebølle Culture. The Brabrand Lake area is still an active archaeological site today and has revealed Bronze Age settlements and Viking activities such as a large shipbuilding yard.\n\n<br>\n\n"}

It has been pointed out that those most responsible for climate change are not the same people as those most vulnerable to its effects.\n\nTerms such as climate justice and ecological justice ('eco justice') are used worldwide, and have been adopted by various organizations.\n\nAn article in the scientific journal \"Nature\" (Patz, 2005) concluded that the human-induced warming that the world is now experiencing is already causing 150,000 deaths and 5 million incidents of disease each year from additional malaria and diarrhea, mostly in the poorest nations. Death and disease incidents are likely to soar as warming increases. Facts such as this demonstrate that climate change is compromising rights to life, liberty and personal security. Hence, ethical analysis of climate change policy must examine how that policy impacts on those basic rights.\n\nClimate change raises a number of particularly challenging ethical issues about distributive justice, in particular concerning how to fairly share the benefits and burdens of climate change policy options. Many of the policy tools often employed to solve environmental problems such as cost-benefit analysis usually do not adequately deal with these issues because they often ignore questions of just distribution.\n\nIn December 2004 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the \"Collaborative Program on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change\" was launched at the 10th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The major outcome of this meeting was the Buenos Aires Declaration on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change.\n\nThe program on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change seeks to:\n\nGiven the severity of impact to be expected and given the likelihood that some level of important disruptions in living conditions will occur for great numbers of people due to climate change events, this group contends that there is sufficient convergence among ethical principles to make a number of concrete recommendations on how governments should act, or identify ethical problems with positions taken by certain governments, organizations, or individuals.\n\nFacts about climate change and fundamental human rights provide the starting point for climate ethics.\n\n\n\n"}

Energy levels of diatomic dications can be studied with good resolution by measuring the yield of pairs of zero-kinetic-energy electrons from double photoionization of a molecule as a function of the photoionizing wavelength (threshold photoelectrons coincidence spectroscopy – TPEsCO).

DDM is suitable for typical soft materials such as for instance liquids or gels made of colloids, polymers and liquid crystals but also for biological materials like bacteria and cells.\n\nThe typical DDM data is a time sequence of microscope images (movie) acquired at some height within the sample (typically at its mid-plane). If the image intensity is locally proportional to the concentration of particles or molecules to be studied (possibly convoluted with the microscope point spread function (PSF)), each movie can be analyzed in the Fourier space to obtain information about the dynamics of concentration Fourier modes, independent on the fact that the particles/molecules can be individually optically resolved or not. After suitable calibration also information about the Fourier amplitude of the concentration modes can be extracted.\n\nThe concentration-intensity proportionality is valid at least in two very important cases that distinguish two corresponding classes of DDM methods:\n\n\nIn both cases the convolution with the PSF in the real space corresponds to a simple product in the Fourier space, which guarantees that studying a given Fourier mode of the image intensity provides information about the corresponding Fourier mode of the concentration field. In contrast with particle tracking, there is no need of resolving the individual particles, which allows DDM to characterize the dynamics of particles or other moving entities whose size is much smaller than the wavelength of light. Still, the images are acquired in the real space, which provides several advantages with respect to traditional (far field) scattering methods.\n\nDDM is based on an algorithm proposed in and, which is conveniently named Differential Dynamic Algorithm (DDA). DDA works by subtracting images acquired at different times and taking advantage that, as the delay formula_1 between two subtracted images gets large, the energy content of the difference image increases correspondingly. A two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis of the difference images allows to quantify the growth of the signal contains for each wave vector formula_2 and one can calculate the Fourier power spectrum of the difference images for different delays formula_1 to obtain the so-called \"image structure function\" formula_4. Calculation shows that for both scattering- and fluorescence-based DDM\n\nwhere formula_5 is the normalized intermediate scattering function that would be measured in a Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) experiment, formula_6 the sample scattering intensity that would be measured in a Static Light Scattering (SLS) experiment, formula_7 a background term due to the noise along the detection chain formula_8 a transfer function that depends on the microscope details. Equation () shows that DDM can be used for DLS experiments, provided that a model for the normalized intermediate scattering function is available. For instance, in the case of Brownian motion one has formula_9 where formula_10 is the diffusion coefficient of the Brownian particles. If the transfer function formula_8 is determined by calibrating the microscope with a suitable sample, DDM can be employed also for SLS experiments. Alternative algorithms for data analysis are suggested in.\n\nScattering-based DDM belongs to the so-called near-field (or deep Fresnel) scattering family, a recently introduced family of imaging-based scattering methods. \"Near field\" is used here in a similar way to what is used for near field speckles i.e. as a particular case of Fresnel region as opposed to the \"far field\" or Fraunhofer region. The near field scattering family includes also quantitative shadowgraphy and Schlieren.\n\nDDM was introduced in 2008 and it was applied for characterizing the dynamics of colloidal particles in Brownian motion. More recently it has been successfully applied also to the study of aggregation processes of colloidal nanoparticles, of bacterial motions and of the dynamics of anisotropic colloids.\n\n"}

DECs are designed to increase transparency about the energy efficiency of public buildings. The certificate looks similar to the energy labels provided on new cars and electrical appliances such as fridges and freezers – it uses a similar scale for energy efficiency, i.e. from A to G with A being the most efficient and G the least. The aim of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is for the public to receive energy information about a building they are visiting.\n\nIn Ireland, the display of a DEC became mandatory for all public buildings over 1,000m² from 1 January, 2009. Since 9 July 2015, all public buildings in the UK over 250m² must display a DEC prominently at all times. Where the building has a total useful floor area of more than 1,000m², a UK DEC is valid for 12 months. The accompanying advisory report is valid for seven years. Where the building has a total useful floor area of between 250m² and 999m², the DEC and advisory report are valid for 10 years.\n\nDECs are designed to promote the improvement of the energy performance of buildings. The A3 sized certificate is valid for one year and is accompanied by an Advisory Report (AR) which is valid for seven years. The advisory report is designed to help building owners and occupiers to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings so that future DECs show a better rating. ARs do not need to be displayed, but must be available.\n\nDECs and ARs must be undertaken by an accredited energy assessors using approved software. In order to produce the DEC the energy assessor needs to know the gross internal floor area of the building and the operating hours together with actual meter readings or consignment notes for all fuels used during the year of assessment. It is, therefore, important for owners and occupiers of public buildings over 1,000m² to maintain good records of fuel used. If the energy assessor does not have access to suitable and sufficient information then a DEC cannot be produced.\n\nThe option to generate a default G rating was withdrawn in the UK on April 16, 2011.\n\nThe penalty for each breach is £500 for failing to display a DEC at all times in a prominent place clearly visible to the public and £1,000 for failing to have possession of a valid advisory report. In addition to these penalties, it is still necessary to commission a DEC and an advisory report.\n\nIn the future the Government is expected to extend the requirement for DECs large privately owned buildings which the public have access to, such as supermarkets.\n\nDEC_Guildance\n\n\n"}

It does not currently produce any crude oil. In February 2006, Paraguay’s Public Works Ministry announced that oil had been discovered in the western Chaco region by British oil company CDS, though CDS stated that the reservoir was too tight to facilitate unassisted oil production.\n\nState-owned Petróleos Paraguayos (Petropar) has a monopoly on all crude oil and petroleum product sales and imports in Paraguay. It operates Paraguay's sole refinery, the Villa Elisa facility.\n\nLike many oil-importing countries in the Western Hemisphere, Paraguay has tried to foster the development of special deals for importing crude oil and refined products from Venezuela. Paraguay, along with Uruguay, signed a deal in 2005 to receive crude oil imports from Venezuela under preferential financing terms. In December 2005, ANCAP and PdVSA, the Uruguayan and Venezuelan national oil companies, agreed to fund a study for the proposed doubling of the capacity at the La Teja plant. The project, which would cost an estimated $800 million, would also upgrade facilities at the refinery so that it could handle heavier Venezuelan crude varieties.\n\nParaguay has no proven natural gas reserves, and it neither produces nor consumes natural gas. In recent years, the country has sought to promote the consumption of natural gas as a way to decrease the use of firewood and charcoal, which has contributed to deforestation in the country. However, barriers to natural gas consumption include a lack of domestic natural gas production and the absence of import pipelines.\n\nParaguay has attracted some interest from international natural gas companies, with UK-based CDS Oil & Gas announcing in early 2004 that it had successfully completed a production test at its Independencia-1 well in the northwestern part of the country. Other companies that have signed exploration concessions with Paraguay’s government include H.A & E.R. Exploraciones, Pilcomayo Petróleos S.A., Hidroener Consultora, Guaraní Exploration, Union Oil, Paraguay Gas, Boreal Petróleos, Aurora Petróleos and Amerisur.\n\nParaguay has pursued several natural gas import options. In 2001, Brazil proposed the Gas Integration Project (Gasin), a natural gas pipeline linking Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil. There has not been much progress to date on the implementation of this proposal. In 2002, the Bolivian and Paraguayan governments signed a preliminary agreement allowing for the construction of a pipeline from southern Bolivia to Asuncion. In June 2006, the two governments approved a plan to move forward with the pipeline, which would have an initial capacity of and require an investment of at least $2 billion.\n\nParaguay generated 51.8 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2004, while consuming only 3.1 TWh. Almost all of the country’s electricity consumption comes from a single facility, the bi-national Itaipu dam. Paraguay is one of the world’s largest net exporters of electric power.\n\nParaguay's state-owned utility, Administracion Nacional de Electricidad (ANDE), controls the country’s entire electricity market, including generation, distribution and transmission. It operates a single hydroelectric dam, Acaray, and six thermal power plants, with total installed capacity of 220 megawatts (MW). The company is also responsible for Paraguay’s share of two bi-national hydroelectric facilities (see below). ANDE operates of transmission lines and of distribution lines. Over 92 percent of the country has electricity service.\n\nParaguay operates two hydroelectric dams in cooperation with its neighbors: Itaipu (Brazil) and Yacyreta (Argentina). The Itaipu dam was the largest hydroelectric facility in the world, before the completion of the Three Gorges Dam in China. Itaipu has 18 generators and a total installed capacity of 14,000 MW, evenly shared between Paraguay and Brazil. In 2004, Paraguay consumed 16 percent of its share of Itaipu production, exporting the rest to Brazil. Yacyreta, completed in 1999, has 20 generators and a total installed capacity of 3,100 MW. In 2014 Paraguay consumed almost 5 percent of its share of Yacyreta’s production, exporting the rest to Argentina.

Floods can occur because of a combination of sources of flooding, such as high groundwater and an inadequate surface water drainage system. The topography, hydrogeology and physical attributes of the existing or proposed development need to be considered. A flood risk assessment should be an evaluation of the flood risk and the consequences and impact and vulnerability.\n\n\"Non-professiona\"l flood risk assessments can be produced by members of the public, Architects, environment assessors, or others who are not specifically professionally qualified in this field. However, it is a complex evaluation and such assessments they can be rejected by Authorities as inadequate, or could be considered as negligent in the event of a flooding event, damage and a claim to insurers being made.\n\nIn the UK, the writing of professional flood risk assessments is undertaken by Civil Engineering Consultants. They will have membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers and are bound by their rules of professional conduct. A key requirement is to ensure such professional flood risk assessments are independent to all parties by carrying out their professional duties with complete objectivity and impartiality. Their professional advice should be supported by professional indemnity insurance for such specific professional advice ultimately held with a Lloyd's of London underwriter.\n\nProfessional flood risk assessments can cover single buildings, or whole regions. They can part of a due-diligence process for existing householders or businesses, or can be required in England and Wales to provide independent evidence to a planning application on the flood risk.\n\nIn England and Wales, the Environment Agency requires a professional Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) to be submitted alongside planning applications in areas that are known to be at risk of flooding (within flood zones 2 or 3) and/ or are greater than 1ha in area, planning permission is not usually granted until the FRA has been accepted by the Environment Agency.\n\nFlood Risk Assessments are required to be completed according to the National Planning Policy Framework, which replaces Planning Policy Statement PPS 25: Development and Flood Risk. The initial legislation (PPG25) was introduced in 2001 and subsequently revised.\n\nPPS 25 was designed to \"strengthen and clarify the key role of the planning system in managing flood risk and contributing to adapting to the impacts of climate change.\" and sets out policies for local authorities to ensure flood risk is taken into account during the planning process to prevent inappropriate development in high risk areas and to direct development away from areas at highest risk.\n\nIn its introduction, PPS25 states \"flooding threatens life and causes substantial damage to property [and that] although [it] cannot be wholly prevented, its impacts can be avoided and reduced through good planning and management\".\n\nFor a flood risk assessment to be written, information is needed concerning the existing and proposed developments, the Environment Agency modeled flood levels and topographic levels on site. At its most simple (and cheapest) level an FRA can provide an indication of whether a development will be allowed to take place at a site.\n\nAn initial idea of the risk of fluvial flooding to a local area can be found on the Environment Agency flood map website.\n\nFRAs consist of a detailed analysis of available data to inform the Environment Agency of flood risk at an individual site and also recommend to the developer any mitigation measures. More costly analysis of flood risk can be achieved through detailed flood modelling to challenge the agency's modelled levels and corresponding flood zones.\n\nThe FRA takes into account the risk and impact of flooding on the site, and takes into consideration how the development may affect flooding in the local area. It also includes provides recommendations as to how the risk of flooding to the development can be mitigated.\n\nFRAs should also consider flooding from all sources including fluvial, groundwater, surface water runoff and sewer flooding.\n\nIn 2006, the Planning Service, part of The Department of the Environment, published Planning Policy Statement 15 (PPS15): Planning and flood risk. The guidelines are precautionary and advise against development in flood plains and areas subject to historical flooding. In exceptional cases a FRA can be completed to justify development in flood risk areas. Advice on flood risk assessment is provided to the Planning Service by the Rivers Agency, which is the statutory drainage and flood defence authority for Northern Ireland.\n\nIn 2009, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Office of Public Works published planning guidelines requiring local authorities to apply a sequential approach to flood risk management. The guidelines require that proposed development in flood risk areas must undergo a justification test, consisting of a flood risk assessment.\n\n\n"}

It was first introduced by Spalding (1970). It is a combination of central difference scheme and upwind difference scheme as it exploits the favorable properties of both of these schemes.\n\nHybrid difference scheme is a method used in the numerical solution for convection-diffusion problems. These problems play important roles in computational fluid dynamics. It can be described by the general partial equation as follows:\n\nWhere, formula_3 is density, formula_4 is the velocity vector, formula_5 is the diffusion coefficient and formula_6 is the source term. In this equation property, formula_7 can be temperature, internal energy or component of velocity vector formula_4 in x, y and z directions.\n\nFor one-dimensional analysis of convection-diffusion problem in steady state and without the source the equation reduces to,\n\nWith boundary conditions, formula_11 and formula_12, where L is the length, formula_13 and formula_14 are the given values.\n\nIntegrating equation over the control volume containing node N, and using Gauss’ theorem i.e.,\n\nYields the following result,\n\nWhere, A is the cross-sectional area of the control volume.\nThe equation must also satisfy the continuity equation, i.e.,\n\nNow let us define variables F and D to represent the convection mass flux and diffusion conductance at cell faces,\n\nHence, equations () and () transform into the following equations:\n\nWhere, the lower case letters denote the values at the faces and the upper case letters denote that at the nodes.\nWe also define a non-dimensional parameter Péclet number (Pe) as a measure of the relative strengths of convection and diffusion,\n\nFor a low Peclet number (|Pe|<2) the flow is characterized as dominated by diffusion. For large Peclet number the flow is dominated by convection.\n\nIn the above equations () and (), we observe that the values require are at the faces, instead of the nodes. Hence approximations are required to fulfill this.\n\nIn the central difference scheme we replace the value at the face with the average of the values at the adjacent nodes,\n\nBy putting these values in equation () and rearranging we get the following result,\n\nwhere,\n\nIn the Upwind scheme we replace the value at the face with the value at the adjacent upstream node. For example, for the flow to the right (Pe>0)as shown in the diagram, we replace the values as follows;\n\nAnd for Pe < 0, we put the values as shown in the figure 3,\n\nBy putting these values in equation () and rearranging we get the same equation as equation (), with the following values of the coefficients:\n\nThe hybrid difference scheme of Spalding (1970) is a combination of the central difference scheme and upwind difference scheme. It makes use of the central difference scheme, which is second order accurate, for small Peclet numbers (|Pe| < 2). For large Peclet numbers (|Pe| > 2) it uses the Upwind difference scheme, which first order accurate but takes into account the convection of the fluid.\n\nAs it can be seen in figure 4 that for Pe = 0, it is a linear distribution and for high Pe it takes the upstream value depending on the flow direction. For example, the value at the left face, in different circumstances is,\n\nSubstituting these values in equation () we get the same equation () with the values of the coefficients as follows,\n\nIt exploits the favourable properties of the central difference and upwind scheme. It switches to upwind difference scheme when central difference scheme produces inaccurate results for high Peclet numbers. It produces physically realistic solution and has proved to be helpful in the prediction of practical flows. The only disadvantage associated with hybrid difference scheme is that the accuracy in terms of Taylor series truncation error is only first order.\n\n\n"}

It is a large lake, covering an area of between 135 and 160 km depending on the water level, but very shallow, being only 3 m deep at its deepest point. The lake contains eight islands and one other that is sometimes an island and sometimes a peninsula. The largest island is known as Halilbey Island. In the southwest the lake is fed by the Mustafakemalpaşa River, which has formed a silty delta. Water leaves the lake by way of the Ulubat stream, flowing to the west, and reaches the Sea of Marmara via the Susurluk River.\n\nMost shores of the lake are covered in submerged plants, and it has the most extensive white water lily beds in Turkey. Ulubat Lake is one of the breeding areas for the endangered pygmy cormorant (\"Phalacrocorax pygmeus\"). The latest DHKD (Society for the Protection of Nature Turkey) survey in June 1998 found 823 pygmy cormorant pairs, 105 night heron pairs, 109 squacco heron pairs, and 48 spoonbill pairs breeding on Ulubat.\n\nThe alternative name Lake \"Apolyont\" comes from the lake's greek classical name Apolloniatis (\"Απολλωνιάτις\"), from Apollonia-on-the-Rhyndacum (modern Gölyazı), an ancient Greek city situated on its banks which had considerable importance since it was on major trade routes.\n\nModern residential areas by its shores are Mustafakemalpaşa (formerly Kirmasti) and Karacabey (formerly Mikalick). The area was famous for centuries for its silkworm cultivation, but this industry has died out due to synthetic fabrics. The main industry today is fishing.\n\nSt. Constantine is a small island inside the lake. During the Byzantine era, there was a monastery of St. Constantine on the island. Today the island is uninhabited, but the monastery has survived Ottoman conquest of Asia Minor. The orthodox monastery has received attention from scholars\nbecause of its inscribed cross type with apses east and west.\n\nThe lake, which is in unprotected status, was declared by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area in 1989 for its waterfowl species of international character and species, which are globally threatened.\n\n"}

The President of the United States can establish a national monument by presidential proclamation, and the United States Congress can do so by legislation. The president's authority arises from the \"Antiquities Act of 1906\", which authorizes the president to proclaim \"historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest\" as national monuments. Concerns about protecting mostly prehistoric Indian ruins and artifacts—collectively termed antiquities—on western federal lands prompted the legislation. Its purpose was to allow the president to quickly preserve public land without waiting for legislation to pass through an unconcerned Congress. The ultimate goal was to protect all historic and prehistoric sites on U.S. federal lands.\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt established the first national monument, Devils Tower in Wyoming, on September 24, 1906. He established 18 national monuments, although only nine still retain that designation. Sixteen presidents have created national monuments since the program began; only Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush did not. Bill Clinton created nineteen and expanded three others. Jimmy Carter protected vast parts of Alaska, proclaiming fifteen national monuments, some of which later were promoted to national parks. President Barack Obama created or expanded 34 national monuments, the most of any president, with over half a billion acres of public land and water protected.\n\nNational monuments are located in 32 states as well as in the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Minor Outlying Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Arizona, with 18, has the largest number of national monuments, followed by California with 17 and New Mexico with 14. At least 65 national monuments protect places of natural significance, including 12 geological sites, seven marine sites, and five volcanic sites. Twenty-three national monuments have major sites associated with Native Americans, while 34 are other historical sites, including twelve forts.\n\nMany have been redesignated as national parks or another status by Congress, while others have been transferred to state control or disbanded.\n\nEight federal agencies in five departments manage the 130 current U.S. national monuments. Of these, 116 monuments are managed by a single agency, while 14 are co-managed by two agencies. One of the NPS's national monuments, Grand Canyon-Parashant, is not an official unit because it overlaps with Lake Mead National Recreation Area.\n\n"}

After crossing to the Pacific Ocean coast of Mexico at Acapulco he sailed once again in a westerly direction, visiting the Mariana Islands, and the Philippines, before eventually reaching the Empire of China, where he landed in Fujian province.

The islands lie off the Sumatran coast, across the Mentawai Strait. The indigenous inhabitants of the islands are known as the Mentawai people. The Mentawai Islands have become a noted destination for surfing.\n\nThe Mentawai Islands have been administered as a regency within the West Sumatra (\"Sumatera Barat\") province since 1999. The regency seat is Tua Pejat, on the island of Sipora. Padang, the capital of the province, lies on the Sumatran mainland opposite Siberut. The regency is divided into ten districts (\"kecamatan\"), tabulated below from south to north with their 2010 census populations.\n\nThe islands have been separated from Sumatra since the mid-Pleistocene period, which has allowed at least twenty endemic species to develop amongst its flora and fauna. This includes six endemic primates: the Kloss's gibbon (\"Hylobates klossii\"), Mentawai macaque (\"Macaca pagensis\"), Siberut macaque (\"Macaca siberu\"), Mentawai langur (\"Presbytis potenziani\"), Siberut langur (\"Presbytis siberu\"), and pig-tailed langur (\"Simias concolor\"). They are highly endangered due to logging, unsustainable hunting, and conversion of rainforest to palm oil plantations. Some areas of the Mentawai Islands rainforest ecoregion are protected, such as the Siberut National Park. Red junglefowl, the Asian palm civet and crab-eating macaque are also native.\n\nThe Mentawai Islands lie above the Sunda megathrust, a seismically active zone responsible for many great earthquakes.

MWP seeks to develop new scientific insights and knowledge through high altitude and record seeking glider flights with the goal of increasing overall flight safety and improving pilot training.\n\nWind movement over terrain and ground obstacles can create wavelike wind formations which can reach up to the stratosphere. In 1998 the pilots René Heise and Klaus Ohlmann founded the MWP, a project for global classification, research, and analysis of orographically created wind structures (e.g. Chinook, Foehn, Mistral, Zonda). The MWP is an independent non-profit-project of the Scientific and Meteorological Section of the Organisation Scientifique et Technique du Vol à Voile (OSTIV) and is supported by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).\n\nThe MWP was originally focused on achieving better understanding. of the complex thermal and dynamic air movements in the atmosphere, and using that knowledge to achieve ever greater long distance soaring flights. As MWP gained greater awareness of the power inherent to mountain wave-like structures in the atmosphere, and their strong vertical airflows, it became obvious that they presented great dangers to civil aviation in multiple ways. Therefore, the focus of the MWP shifted to a more scientific approach to the airflow phenomena, with the goal of discovering new ways to increase overall aviation safety. Through the support of other scientists and cooperation partners the core group became more powerful and gained greater depth of knowledge. The integration of Joerg Hacker from the Airborne Research Australia (ARA) into the core group significantly enhanced the overall depth of knowledge of the group.\n\nIn order to learn more about the relevant physical process in the atmosphere, the MWP Team launched two expeditions in the Argentinean Andes in 1999 and 2006. For high altitude flights a modified Stemme S10 VT motorglider was used as a platform for airborne data acquisition and measurement. The pilots were assisted with life support equipment and physiological preparations by the renowned flight physicians of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and by astronaut Ulf Merbold.\n\nThanks to the help of qualified scientists and state-of-the-art sensor technology, the MWP achieved its goal to gather and analyze wave structure data with impressive results at the operation in Mendoza in October 2006. Research flights and operations were completed in the region between the Tupungato (5.700 m) and Aconcagua (6.900m), which is very well known for its extremely treacherous turbulence.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2004 MWP team member Klaus Ohlmann further developed and expanded on the knowledge about wave systems gained in the Andes in 1999, and accumulated a wealth of experience. This educational process allowed him to win the OSTIV Kuettner Prize for the first 2000 km straight out wave flight, as well as completing the world's longest recorded soaring flight of 3,008 km. He was supported by his MWP teammates in Germany using internet communications to provide specific weather predictions using a new weather forecasting tool. In these flights, he provided crucial in-flight data, which in turn helped to improve subsequent weather predictions by the team in Germany.\nTwo MWP members participated in the 2006 field research campaign of the Terrain Induced Rotor Experiment (T-REX) which took place in the Sierra Nevada (U.S.A.). René Heise served as scientific reviewer for the National Science Foundation and contributed MWP wave forecasts to the data archive. Wolf-Dietrich Herold documented activities in Boulder/CO and Bishop/CA and produced a TV-report of the project for the German TV station RBB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term nurse cell is used in several unrelated ways in different scientific fields.\n\nNurse cells are specialized macrophages residing in the bone marrow that assist in the development of red blood cells. They absorb the nuclei of immature red blood cells and may provide growth factors to help the red blood cells mature. In the bone marrow, immature red blood cells (erythroblasts) can be seen grouped in a cluster around a nurse cell.\n\nThe epithelial cell found in the cortex of the Thymus is also called a \"nurse cell.\" These cells produce Thymic hormones that cause T Lymphocytes to mature and differentiate.\n\nIn parasitology, a nurse cell is an infected cell in the disease trichinosis discovered by Dickson Despommier. A trichinella larva enters a cell and develops there, probably as a way of concealing itself from the immune system. The parasite has evolved a way of stimulating blood vessel development around the cell, in order to receive the nutrients it needs. In trichinosis, nurse cells are invariably skeletal muscle cells; these are the only type of cell that can support the parasite.\n\nIn mycology, a nurse cell is any hyphae that supplies food material to spores that have detached from the basidia; used especially in reference to taxa from the family Sclerodermataceae.\n\nIn respect to invertebrates, nurse cells are polytenic germline cells that contribute to the development of the oocyte, producing multiple nuclei. In fruit flies \"(Drosophila),\" nurse cells surround the developing oocyte and synthesize proteins and RNAs that are to be deposited in it. Nurse cells are highly polyploid (up to 8000C). They dump their cytoplasm containing RNAs and proteins into the oocyte via ring canals.\n\nDue to their high metabolic activity, nurse cells likely experience the DNA damaging effect of oxidative free radicals produced as a byproduct of this metabolism. This damaging effect would otherwise befall the DNA of the egg cells if they were responsible for their own synthesis. The many genome copies in each nurse cell may provide redundancy of genetic information that would allow the nurse cell to carry out its provisioning function even in the face of considerable oxidative DNA damage.\n\n"}

For these Olympus Marathons the classic distance of 42.195 kilometers provides a clue to the distance of some of the runs in the Olympus. Starting in 2010, events established that surpass the classic marathon distance. In some races, runners run over distances of 57 km, 70 km or almost 100 km.\n\nAt the stations along the route, the runners are provided with drinks and snacks and mostly medical aid. They are offered water, electrolytic drinks, bananas, salty biscuits, sandwiches, chocolates and more. The medical care is provided by rescue services. The fastest runners finishes the race in about four hours.\n\nAround 1970, inspired by mountain running in the Alps, the first thoughts of a marathon in Olympus came on. Younger members of the Mountaineering Association E.O.S. Thessaloniki implemented the idea; a running track was selected, the paths were cleaned and marked. The first run took place on July 6, 1986. Around 100 Greek runners participated; although starting numbers have been assigned, there are no statistics on the results of this first Olympus Marathon. The new sport was called \"Mountaineer Marathon\", not only on the Olympus region, but in the whole of Greece, where gradually hill running established. In the first years the number of participants varied greatly, only through the \"outdoor movement\" found more Greek athletes to this sport.\n\nIn order to arouse international interest, the \"Olympus Marathon\" event was founded in 2003. The first run took place in June 2004 with the help of Litochoro Municipality and the Litochoro Mountaineering Association. Based on the tradition of the ancient Greeks, who every year, to pay homage to the gods, made a procession from Dion to the peaks of Mount Olympus, the run starts in Dion - the religious center of the Macedonians (motto: running with the gods). 115 athletes participated in the first race, of which 103 were scored. Seven of them were foreigners.\n\nIn 2012 the first \"Olympus Mythical Trail\" was organized. It is an extreme run over about 100 kilometers which is also run at night. Since 2015, the \"Lost Trail\", a shortened to 57 kilometers run, offered to let the athletes on lesser known paths explore the Olympus during daylight.\n\nThere are other runs in the Olympus over shorter distances, in the snow, as well as mixed competitions, such as a biathlon, where the athletes run and bike.\n\nThe first organizer of marathons in Greek mountains was the E.O.S. Thessaloniki (Greek Ελληνικός Ορειβατικός Σύλλογος Θεσσαλονίκης, Greek mountaineering club Thessaloniki). Since 1986, the marathon (mountaineer marathon of Olympus, Ορειβατικός Μαραθώνιος Ολύμπου) with only one interruption, annually on the first Sunday in September is organized. Patronage of the event has taken over the community Dion Olympou. In 2018, around 300 runners took part in the competition, of which 249 had finished the race in accordance with the regulations.\n\n\nThe overall length of this running track is about 41.85 kilometers.\n\nThe Olympus Marathon, the Olympus Ultra and the Olympus Vertical take place on the last weekend of June. These events are supported by the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism, the prefecture of Pieria and the municipality of Dion-Olympos. In 2018, around 800 runners from 25 countries took part in the competition.\nThe three races, Olympus Marathon, Olympus Ultra and Olympus Vertikal are a part of the Skyrunner World Series.\n\n\nThe total length of the route is 43.8 kilometers.\n\nThe race is over a distance of about 70 kilometers. The start is in Dion, the route also leads across the western, Thessalian, part of Olympus. It will overcome a total of 5200 meters in altitude. The organizer prescribes for this extreme run a certain equipment for the runners:\n\n\nThis run will be started in Prionia (1100 m). The goal is to overcome more than 1000 meters in altitude over a distance of 4.3 kilometers. There are no categories or restrictions for this race, any person over the age of 18 is allowed.\n\nThe race takes place annually on the first weekend in July and covers a distance of about 100 kilometers, with 6410 meters of altitude to overcome. Until 2017 it started in the park at the church Agios Joannis, above Litochoro. From 2018, the start and finish were moved to Lakko, on the Enipeas River in Litochoro. The offer is aimed at experienced runners; a medical certificate is not required, but proof of the participant's experience of difficult routes. Greek runners must have completed a number of races within the last three years, foreigners must have completed at least one 80 kilometer run during this period. About 90% of the route is forest trails and mountain trails. This extreme run takes place partly on the Thessalian side of the Olympus and is limited to 28 hours. The runners cross the third highest peak of Mount Olympus, the Skolio (2,910 m).\n\n\nThe total length of the track is 99.6 kilometers, at each of the above stations runners are provided with drinks and snacks and medical aid if necessary. A total of 17 checkpoints must be passed. Also for this run a certain equipment is mandatory.\n\nIn September there is a shorter extreme run that has to be done within 15 hours.\n\n\nThe total length of the route is 57 kilometers, at each of the above stations, the runners are supplied with drinks and snacks and medical aid if necessary.\n\nThe race is organized by Faethon Olympus Marathon and supported by the mountaineering associations of Elassona, Olympiada (Mytikas), Sparmos (Olympus) and Kalyvion (Christakis). \n\nThere are three different runs available:\n\n\nUnlike the events mentioned above, these runs take place mainly in the Thessalian part of the Olympus. The races are started in Kokkinopilos, the runners are required to carry a certain equipment. Runners starting at the age of 20 years are entitled to start and the runs are divided into different categories. The organizer does not require a certificate of health status of the athletes.\n\n\nA triathlon will complement the range of extreme sports activities in the Olympus. It includes the classic three triathlon sports; four kilometers of swimming, 182 kilometers of cycling and around 40 kilometers of running. The group of male and female athletes are divided into five age groups. To be admitted to the race, the organizer requires a medical certificate. Each participant needs a companion with his own escort vehicle. It is expected that the athletes will manage the triathlon with a minimum of support. So there are only two stations where the runners are supplied for the 40 kilometer run.\n\nFrom a boat the competition starts, the swimming ends at the beach of Platamonas. The route depends on the wind direction, the athletes are accompanied by boats.\n\nFrom Platamonas, the Olymp is almost completely rounded. The cycle race takes place on paved roads, 4100 vertical meters have to be overcome. Target is the place Vrisopoules.\n\nFrom Vrisopoules, the route leads over the second highest peak of the mountains (Skolio, 2911 m) on forest roads down to the river Orlias, which is the destination of the triathlon. There are 2250 vertical meters to overcome.\n\n\n"}

Although today's atmosphere is dominated by nitrogen (about 78%), oxygen (about 21%), and argon (about 1%), the pre-biological atmosphere is thought to have been a highly reducing atmosphere, having virtually no free oxygen, virtually no argon, which is generated by the radioactive decay of K, and to have been dominated by nitrogen, carbon dioxide and methane.\n\nAppreciable concentrations of free oxygen were probably not present until about 2,500 million years ago (Ma). After the Great Oxygenation Event, quantities of oxygen produced as a by-product of photosynthesis by cyanobacteria or blue-green algae began to exceed the quantities of chemically reducing materials, notably dissolved iron. By the beginning of the Cambrian period 541 Ma, free oxygen concentrations had increased sufficiently to enable the evolution of multicellular organisms. Following the subsequent appearance, rapid evolution and radiation of land plants, which covered much of the Earth's land surface, beginning about 450 Ma, oxygen concentrations reached and later exceeded current values during the early Carboniferous, when atmospheric carbon dioxide was drawn down below current concentrations. This may have contributed to the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse during the Moscovian and Kasimovian ages of the Pennsylvanian subperiod.\n\nGeological studies of ancient rock formations can give information on paleoatmospheric composition, pressure, density, etc. at specific points in Earth's history.\n\nA 2012 study looked at the imprints made by falling raindrops onto freshly deposited volcanic ash, laid down in the Archean Eon 2,700 Ma in the Ventersdorp Supergroup, South Africa. They linked the terminal velocity of the raindrops directly to the air density of the paleoatmosphere and showed that it had less than twice the density of the modern atmosphere, and likely had similar if not lower density.\n\nA similar study in 2016 looked at the size distribution of gas bubbles in basaltic lava flows that solidified at sea level also during the Archean (~2,700 Ma). They found an atmospheric pressure of only 0.23 ± 0.23 bar.\n\nBoth results contradict theories that suggest the Archean was kept warm during the Faint Young Sun period by extremely high levels of carbon dioxide or nitrogen.\n\nA 2016 study performed mass spectrometry on air bubbles trapped inside rock salt deposited 813 Myr ago. They detected an oxygen content of 10.9%, much higher than had been expected from indirect measures. This suggested the Great Oxygenation Event may have happened much earlier than previously thought.\n"}

{"id": "11589621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11589621", "title": "Patch dynamics", "text": "Patch dynamics\n\nPatch dynamics is an ecological perspective that the structure, function, and dynamics of ecological systems can be understood through studying their interactive patches. Patch dynamics, as a term, may also refer to the spatiotemporal changes within and among patches that make up a landscape. Patch dynamics is ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic systems across organizational levels and spatial scales. From a patch dynamics perspective, populations, communities, ecosystems, and landscapes may all be studied effectively as mosaics of patches that differ in size, shape, composition, history, and boundary characteristics. \n\nThe idea of patch dynamics dates back to the 1940s when plant ecologists studied the structure and dynamics of vegetation in terms of the interactive patches that it comprises. A mathematical theory of patch dynamics was developed by Simon Levin and Robert Paine in the 1970s, originally to describe the pattern and dynamics of an intertidal community as a patch mosaic created and maintained by tidal disturbances. Patch dynamics became a dominant theme in ecology between the late 1970s and the 1990s. \n\nPatch dynamics is a conceptual approach to ecosystem and habitat analysis that emphasizes dynamics of heterogeneity within a system (i.e. that each area of an ecosystem is made up of a mosaic of small 'sub-ecosystems').\n\nDiverse patches of habitat created by natural disturbance regimes are seen as critical to the maintenance of this diversity (ecology). A \"habitat patch\" is any discrete area with a definite shape, spatial and configuration used by a species for breeding or obtaining other resources. \"Mosaics\" are the patterns within landscapes that are composed of smaller elements, such as individual forest stands, shrubland patches, highways, farms, or towns.\n\nHistorically, due to the short time scale of human observation, mosaic landscapes were perceived to be static patterns of human population mosaics. This focus centered on the idea that the status of a particular population, community, or ecosystem could be understood by studying a particular patch within a mosaic. However, this perception ignored the conditions that interact with, and connect patches. In 1979, Bormann and Likens coined the phrase \"shifting mosaic\" to describe the theory that landscapes change and fluctuate, and are in fact dynamic. This is related to the battle of cells that occurs in a Petri dish.\n\n\"Patch dynamics\" refers to the concept that landscapes are dynamic. There are three states that a patch can exist in: \"potential\", \"active\", and \"degraded\". Patches in the \"potential\" state are transformed into active patches through colonization of the patch by dispersing species arriving from other \"active\" or \"degrading\" patches. Patches are transformed from the \"active\" state to the \"degraded\" state when the patch is abandoned, and patches change from \"degraded\" to \"potential\" through a process of recovery.\n\nLogging, fire, farming, and reforestation can all contribute to the process of colonization, and can effectively change the shape of the patch. \"Patch dynamics\" also refers to changes in the structure, function, and composition of individual patches that can, for example, effect the rate of nutrient cycling.\n\nPatches are also linked, although separated from other patches, migration occurs from one patch to another. This migration maintains the population of some patches, and can be the mechanism by which some plant species spread. This implies that ecological systems within landscapes are open, rather than closed and isolated. (Pickett, 2006)\n\nRecognizing the patch dynamics within a system is needed for conservation (ecology) efforts to succeed. Successful conservation includes understanding how a patch changes and predicting how they will be affected by external forces. These externalities include natural effects, such as land use, disturbance, restoration, and succession, and the effects of human activities. In a sense, conservation is the active maintenance of patch dynamics (Pickett, 2006). The analysis of patch dynamics could be used to predict changes in biodiversity of an ecosystem. When patches of species can be tracked, it has been shown that fluctuations on the biggest patch (the most dominant species) can be used as an early warning of a Biodiversity collapse . That means that if external conditions, like climate change and habitat fragmentation, change the internal dynamics of patches a sharp reduction in biodiversity can be detected before it is produced . \n\n\n"}

{"id": "186447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186447", "title": "Peneplain", "text": "Peneplain\n\nIn geomorphology and geology a peneplain is a low-relief plain formed by protracted erosion. This is the definition in the broadest of terms, albeit with frequency the usage of peneplain is meant to imply the representation of a near-final (or penultimate) stage of fluvial erosion during times of extended tectonic stability. Peneplains are sometimes associated with the cycle of erosion theory of William Morris Davis, but Davis and other workers have also used the term in a purely descriptive manner without any theory or particular genesis attached.\n\nThe existence of some peneplains, and peneplanation as a process in nature, is not without controversy, due to a lack of contemporary examples and uncertainty in identifying relic examples. By some definitions, peneplains grade down to a base level represented by sea level, yet in other definitions such a condition is ignored. Geomorphologist Karna Lidmar-Bergström and co-workers consider the base level criterion crucial and above the precise mechanism of formation of peneplains, including this way some pediplains among peneplains.\n\nWhile peneplains are usually assumed to form near sea level it has also been posited that peneplains can form at height if extensive sedimentation raises the local base level sufficiently or if river networks are continuously obstructed by tectonic deformation. The peneplains of the Pyrenees and Tibetan Plateau may exemplify these two cases respectively.\n\nA common misconception about peneplains is that they ought to be so plain they are featureless. In fact, some peneplains may be hilly as they reflect irregular deep weathering, forming a plain grading to a base level only at a grand-scale.\n\nThere are various terms for landforms that are either alternatives to classical peneplains, a sub-set of peneplains or partially overlap with the term. The last is the case of planation surfaces that may be peneplains or not, while some peneplains are not planation surfaces.\n\nIn their 2013 work Green, Lidmar-Bergström and co-workers provide the following classication scheme for peneplains:\n\nRhodes Fairbridge and Charles Finkl argue that peneplains are often of mixed origin (polygenetic) as they may have been shaped by etchplanation during periods of humid climate and pediplanation during periods of arid and semi-arid climate. The long time spans under which some peneplains evolve ensures varied climatic influences. The same authors do also list marine abrasion and glacial erosion among processes that can contribute in shaping peneplains.\n\nIn addition epigene peneplains can be distinguished from exhumed peneplains. Epigene are those that have never been buried or covered by sedimentary rock. Exhumed peneplains are those that are re-exposed after having been buried in sediments.\n\nThe oldest identifiable peneplain in a region is known as a primary peneplain An example of a primary peneplain is the Sub-Cambrian peneplain in southern Sweden.\n\nThe peneplain concept is often juxtaposed to that of pediplain. However authors like Karna Lidmar-Bergström classify pediplains as a type of peneplain. On the contrary Lester Charles King held them as incompatible landforms arguing that peneplains do not exist. King wrote: \nAccording to King pediplains main difference to Davis’ peneplains is in the history and processes behind, and less so in the final shape. A difference in form that may be present is that of residual hills which in Davis’ peneplains are to have gentle slopes while in pediplains they ought to have the same steepness as the slopes in the early stages of erosion leading to pediplanation. Given that the coalesced pediments of the pediplains form a series of very gentle concave slopes, a difference with Davis' understanding of peneplains may lie in that his idealized peneplains had very gentle convex slopes instead. However, Davis' views on subject are not fully clear. Contrary to this view Rhodes Fairbridge and Charles Finkl argue that the precise mechanism of formation (pediplanation, etc.) is irrelevant and that the term peneplain has been used and can be used in a purely descriptive manner. Further, alternation of processes with varying climate, relative sea level and biota make old surfaces unlikely to be of a single origin.\n\nPeneplains that are detached from their base level are identified by either hosting an accumulation of sediments that buries it or by being in an uplifted position. Burial preserves the peneplain. Any exposed peneplain detached from its baselevel can be considered a paleosurface or paleoplain. Uplift of a peneplain commonly results in renewed erosion. As Davis put it in 1885:\n\nUplifted peneplains can be preserved as fossil landfoms in conditions of extreme aridity or under non-eroding cold-based glacier ice. Erosion of peneplains by glaciers in shield regions is limited. In the Fennoscandian Shield average glacier erosion during the Quaternary amounts to tens of meters, albeit this was not evenly distributed. For glacier erosion to be effective in shields a long \"preparation period\" of weathering under non-glacial conditions may be a requirement.\n\nSilicification of peneplain surfaces exposed to sub-tropical and tropical climate for long enough time can protect them from erosion.\n\n"}

For example, relict permafrost is an area of ancient permafrost which remains despite a change in climate which would prohibit new permafrost from forming. Or it could be a fragment of ancient soil or sediment found in a younger stratum. A relict sediment is an area of ancient sediment which remains unburied despite changes in the surrounding environment. In pedology, the study of soil formation and classification, ancient soil found in the geologic record is called a paleosol, material formed in the distant past on what was then the surface. A relict paleosol is still found on the surface, and yet is known to have been formed under conditions radically different from the present climate and topography.\n\nIn mineralogy, a relict mineral is a surviving mineral from a parent rock that underwent a destructive or transformative process. For example, serpentinite is a kind of rock formed in a process called serpentinization, in which a host mineral produces a pseudomorph, and the original mineral is eventually replaced and/or destroyed, but is still present until the process is complete.\n\nWithin geomorphology a relict landform is a landform that took form from geomorphic processes that are not active at present. In a Scandinavian context, this is often meant to imply that relict landforms were formed before the last glaciation and survived it under cold-based parts of the ice sheet. Climatic geomorphologist Julius Büdel estimated that 95% of mid-latitude landforms are relict.\n"}

{"id": "319168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=319168", "title": "Shield volcano", "text": "Shield volcano\n\nA shield volcano is a type of volcano usually composed almost entirely of fluid lava flows. It is named for its low profile, resembling a warrior's shield lying on the ground. This is caused by the highly fluid (low viscosity) lava erupted, which travels farther than lava erupted from a stratovolcano, and results in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava, building up the shield volcano's distinctive form.\n\nShield volcanoes are built by effusive eruptions, which flow out in all directions to create a shield like that of a warrior. The word \"shield\" has a long history, and is derived from the Old English \"scield\" or \"scild\", which is in turn taken from the Proto-Germanic \"*skelduz\", and related to the Gothic \"skildus\", meaning \"to divide, split, or separate\". Shield volcano itself is taken from the German term \"Schildvulkan\".\n\nShield volcanoes are distinguished from the three other major volcanic archetypes—stratovolcanoes, lava domes, and cinder cones—by their structural form, a consequence of their unique magmatic composition. Of these four forms shield volcanoes erupt the least viscous lavas: whereas stratovolcanoes and especially lava domes are the product of highly immotile flows and cinder cones are constructed by explosively eruptive tephra, shield volcanoes are the product of gentle effusive eruptions of highly fluid lavas that produce, over time, a broad, gently sloped eponymous \"shield\". Although the term is generally ascribed to basaltic shields it has also at times been appended to rarer scutiform volcanoes of differing magmatic composition—principally pyroclastic shields, formed by the accumulation of fragmental material from particularly powerful explosive eruptions, and rarer felsic lava shields formed by unusually fluid felsic magmas. Examples of pyroclastic shields include Billy Mitchell volcano in Papua New Guinea and the Purico complex in Chile; an example of a felsic shield is the Big Obsidian Flow in Oregon. Shield volcanoes are also related in origination to vast lava plateaus and flood basalts present in various parts of the world, generalized eruptive features which occur along linear fissure vents and are distinguished from shield volcanoes proper by the lack of an identifiable primary eruptive center.\n\nActive shield volcanoes experience near-continuous eruptive activity over extremely long periods of time, resulting in the gradual build-up of edifices that can reach extremely large dimensions. With the exclusion of flood basalts, mature shields are the largest volcanic features on Earth: the summit of the largest subaerial volcano in the world, Mauna Loa, lies above sea level, and the volcano, over wide at its base, is estimated to contain about of basalt. The mass of the volcano is so great that it has slumped the crust beneath it a further ; accounting for this subsidence and for the height of the volcano above the sea floor, the \"true\" height of Mauna Loa from the start of its eruptive history is about . Mount Everest, by comparison, is in height. In September 2013 a team led by the University of Houston's William Sager announced the singular origination of Tamu Massif, an enormous extinct submarine shield volcano of previously unknown origin which, approximately in area, dwarfs all previously known volcanoes on the planet. The research has not yet been confirmed.\n\nShield volcanoes feature a gentle (usually 2° to 3°) slope that gradually steepens with elevation (reaching approximately 10°) before eventually flattening near the summit, forming an overall upwardly convex shape. In height they are typically about one twentieth their width. Although the general form of a \"typical\" shield volcano varies little worldwide regional differences exist in their size and morphological characteristics. Typical shield volcanoes present in California and Oregon measure in diameter and in height; shield volcanoes in the central Mexican Michoacán–Guanajuato volcanic field, by comparison, average in height and in width, with an average slope angle of 9.4° and an average volume of .\n\nRift zones are a prevalent feature on shield volcanoes that is rare on other volcanic types. The large, decentralized shape of Hawaiian volcanoes as compared to their smaller, symmetrical Icelandic cousins can be attributed to rift eruptions. Fissure venting is common in Hawaii; most Hawaiian eruptions begin with a so-called \"wall of fire\" along a major fissure line before centralizing to a small number of points. This accounts for their asymmetrical shape, whereas Icelandic volcanoes follow a pattern of central eruptions dominated by summit calderas, causing the lava to be more evenly distributed or symmetrical.\n\nMost of what is currently known about shield volcanic eruptive character has been gleaned from studies done on the volcanoes of Hawaii island, by far the most intensively studied of all shields due to their scientific accessibility; the island lends its name to the slow-moving, effusive eruptions typical of shield volcanism, known as Hawaiian eruptions. These eruptions, the calmest of volcanic events, are characterized by the effusive emission of highly fluid basaltic lavas with low gaseous content. These lavas travel a far greater distance than those of other eruptive types before solidifying, forming extremely wide but relatively thin magmatic sheets often less than thick. Low volumes of such lavas layered over long periods of time are what slowly constructs the characteristically low, broad profile of a mature shield volcano.\n\nAlso unlike other eruptive types, Hawaiian eruptions often occur at decentralized fissure vents, beginning with large \"curtains of fire\" that quickly die down and concentrate at specific locations on the volcano's rift zones. Central-vent eruptions, meanwhile, often take the form of large lava fountains (both continuous and sporadic), which can reach heights of hundreds of meters or more. The particles from lava fountains usually cool in the air before hitting the ground, resulting in the accumulation of cindery scoria fragments; however, when the air is especially thick with clasts, they cannot cool off fast enough due to the surrounding heat, and hit the ground still hot, accumulating into spatter cones. If eruptive rates are high enough, they may even form splatter-fed lava flows. Hawaiian eruptions are often extremely long lived; Puʻu ʻŌʻō, a cinder cone of Kīlauea, has been erupting continuously since 1983.\n\nFlows from Hawaiian eruptions can be divided into two types by their structural characteristics: pāhoehoe lava which is relatively smooth and flows with a ropey texture, and ʻaʻā flows which are denser, more viscous (and thus slower moving) and blockier. These lava flows can be anywhere between thick. Aa lava flows move through pressure—the partially solidified front of the flow steepens due to the mass of flowing lava behind it until it breaks off, after which the general mass behind it moves forward. Though the top of the flow quickly cools down, the molten underbelly of the flow is buffered by the solidifying rock above it, and by this mechanism aa flows can sustain movement for long periods of time. Pāhoehoe flows, in contrast, move in more conventional sheets, or by the advancement of lava \"toes\" in snaking lava columns. Increasing viscosity on the part of the lava or shear stress on the part of local topography can morph a pāhoehoe flow into an a'a one, but the reverse never occurs.\n\nAlthough most shield volcanoes are by volume almost entirely Hawaiian and basaltic in origin, they are rarely exclusively so. Some volcanoes, like Mount Wrangell in Alaska and Cofre de Perote in Mexico, exhibit large enough swings in their historical magmatic eruptive characteristics to cast strict categorical assignment in doubt; one geological study of de Perote went so far as to suggest the term \"compound shield-like volcano\" instead. Most mature shield volcanoes have multiple cinder cones on their flanks, the results of tephra ejections common during incessant activity and markers of currently and formerly active sites on the volcano. One prominent such parasitic cones is Puʻu ʻŌʻō on Kīlauea—continuous activity ongoing since 1983 has built up a tall cone at the site of one of the longest-lasting rift eruptions in known history.\n\nThe Hawaiian shield volcanoes and the Galápagos islands are unique in that they are not located near any plate boundaries; instead, the two chains are fed by the movement of oceanic plates over an upwelling of magma known as a hotspot. Over millions of years, the tectonic movement that moves continents also creates long volcanic trails across the seafloor. The Hawaiian and Galápagos shields, and other hotspot shields like them, are both constructed of oceanic island basalt. Their lavas are characterized by high levels of sodium, potassium, and aluminium.\n\nFeatures common in shield volcanism include lava tubes. Lava tubes are cave-like volcanic straights formed by the hardening of overlaying lava. These structures help further the propagation of lava, as the walls of the tube insulates the lava within. Lava tubes can account for a large portion of shield volcano activity; for example, an estimated 58% of the lava forming Kīlauea comes from lava tubes.\n\nIn some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava pours out of a long fissure instead of a central vent, and shrouds the countryside with a long band of volcanic material in the form of a broad plateau. Plateaus of this type exist in Iceland, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho; the most prominent ones are situated along the Snake River in Idaho and the Columbia River in Washington and Oregon, where they have been measured to be over in thickness.\n\nCalderas are a common feature on shield volcanoes. They are formed and reformed over the volcano's lifespan. Long eruptive periods form cinder cones, which then collapse over time to form calderas. The calderas are often filled up by future eruptions, or formed elsewhere, and this cycle of collapse and regeneration takes place throughout the volcano's lifespan.\n\nInteractions between water and lava at shield volcanoes can cause some eruptions to become hydrovolcanic. These explosive eruptions are drastically different from the usual shield volcanic activity, and are especially prevalent at the waterbound volcanoes of the Hawaiian Isles.\n\nShield volcanoes are found worldwide. They can form over hotspots (points where magma from below the surface wells up), such as the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain and the Galápagos Islands, or over more conventional rift zones, such as the Icelandic shields and the shield volcanoes of East Africa. Many shield volcanoes are found in ocean basins, such as Tamu Massif, the world's largest, although they can be found inland as well—East Africa being one example of this.\n\nThe largest and most prominent shield volcano chain in the world is the Hawaiian Islands, a chain of hotspot volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean. The Hawaiian volcanoes are characterized by frequent rift eruptions, their large size (thousands of km in volume), and their rough, decentralized shape. Rift zones are a prominent feature on these volcanoes, and account for their seemingly random volcanic structure. They are fueled by the movement of the Pacific Plate over the Hawaii hotspot, and form a long chain of volcanoes, atolls, and seamounts long with a total volume of over . The chain contains at least 43 major volcanoes, and Meiji Seamount at its terminus near the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench is 85 million years old. The volcanoes follow a distinct evolutionary pattern of growth and death.\n\nThe chain includes the second largest volcano on Earth, Mauna Loa, which stands above sea level and reaches a further below the waterline and into the crust, approximately of rock. Kīlauea, meanwhile, is one of the most active volcanoes on Earth, with the current ongoing eruption having begun in January 1983.\n\nThe Galápagos Islands are an isolated set of volcanoes, consisting of shield volcanoes and lava plateaus, located west of Ecuador. They are driven by the Galápagos hotspot, and are between approximately 4.2 million and 700,000 years of age. The largest island, Isabela Island, consists of six coalesced shield volcanoes, each delineated by a large summit caldera. Española, the oldest island, and Fernandina, the youngest, are also shield volcanoes, as are most of the other islands in the chain. The Galápagos Islands are perched on a large lava plateau known as the Galápagos Platform. This platform creates a shallow water depth of at the base of the islands, which stretch over a -long diameter. Since Charles Darwin's famous visit to the islands in 1835, there have been over 60 recorded eruptions in the islands, from six different shield volcanoes. Of the 21 emergent volcanoes, 13 are considered active.\n\nBlue Hill is a shield volcano on the south western part of Isabela Island in the Galápagos Islands and is one of the most active in the Galapagos, with the last eruption between May and June 2008. The Geophysics Institute at the National Polytechnic School in Quito houses an international team of seismologists and volcanologists whose responsibility is to monitor Ecuadors numerous active volcanoes in the Andean Volcanic Belt and the Galapagos Islands. La Cumbre is an active shield volcano on Fernandina Island in the Galapagos that has been erupting since April 11, 2009.\n\nThe Galápagos islands are geologically young for such a big chain, and the pattern of their rift zones follows one of two trends, one north-northwest, and one east–west. The composition of the lavas of the Galápagos shields are strikingly similar to those of the Hawaiian volcanoes. Curiously, they do not form the same volcanic \"line\" associated with most hotspots. They are not alone in this regard; the Cobb–Eickelberg Seamount chain in the North Pacific is another example of such a delineated chain. In addition, there is no clear pattern of age between the volcanoes, suggesting a complicated, irregular pattern of creation. How exactly the islands were formed remains a geological mystery, although several theories have been fronted.\n\nAnother major center of shield volcanic activity is Iceland. Located over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a divergent tectonic plate in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, Iceland is the site of about 130 volcanoes of various types. Icelandic shield volcanoes are generally of Holocene age, between 5000 and 10000 years old, except for the island of Surtsey, a Surtseyan shield. The volcanoes are also very narrow in distribution, occurring in two bands in the West and North Volcanic Zones. Like Hawaiian volcanoes, their formation initially begins with several eruptive centers before centralizing and concentrating at a single point. The main shield then forms, burying the smaller ones formed by the early eruptions with its lava.\n\nIcelandic shields are mostly small (~), symmetrical (although this can affected by surface topography), and characterized by eruptions from summit calderas. They are composed of either tholeiitic olivine or picritic basalt. The tholeiitic shields tend to be wider and shallower than the picritic shields. They do not follow the pattern of caldera growth and destruction that other shield volcanoes do; caldera may form, but they generally do not disappear.\n\nEast Africa is the site of volcanic activity generated by the development of the East African Rift, a developing plate boundary in Africa, and from nearby hotspots. Some volcanoes interact with both. Shield volcanoes are found near the rift and off the coast of Africa, although stratovolcanoes are more common. Although sparsely studied, the fact that all of its volcanoes are of Holocene age reflects how young the volcanic center is. One interesting characteristic of East African volcanism is a penchant for the formation of lava lakes; these semi-permanent lava bodies, extremely rare elsewhere, form in about nine percent of African eruptions.\n\nThe most active shield volcano in Africa is Nyamuragira. Eruptions at the shield volcano are generally centered within the large summit caldera or on the numerous fissures and cinder cones on the volcano's flanks. Lava flows from the most recent century extend down the flanks more than from the summit, reaching as far as Lake Kivu. Erta Ale in Ethiopia is another active shield volcano, and one of the few places in the world with a permanent lava lake, which has been active since at least 1967, and possibly since 1906. Other volcanic centers include Menengai, a massive shield caldera, and Mount Marsabit, near the town of Marsabit.\n\nVolcanoes are not limited to Earth; they can exist on any rocky planet or moon large or active enough to have a molten inner core, and since probes were first launched in the 1960s, volcanoes have been found across the solar system. Shield volcanoes and volcanic vents have been found on Mars, Venus, and Io; cryovolcanoes on Triton; and subsurface hotspots on Europa.\n\nThe volcanoes of Mars are very similar to the shield volcanoes on Earth. Both have gently sloping flanks, collapse craters along their central structure, and are built of highly fluid lavas. Volcanic features on Mars were observed long before they were first studied in detail during the 1976–1979 Viking mission. The principal difference between the volcanoes of Mars and those on Earth is in terms of size; Martian volcanoes range in size up to high and in diameter, far larger than the high, wide Hawaiian shields. The highest of these, Olympus Mons, is the tallest known mountain on any planet in the solar system.\n\nVenus also has over 150 shield volcanoes which are much flatter, with a larger surface area than those found on Earth, some having a diameter of more than . Although the majority of these are long extinct it has been suggested, from observations by the Venus Express spacecraft, that many may still be active.\n"}

Stars change their positions on the HR diagram throughout their life. Newborn stars of low or intermediate mass are born cold but extremely luminous. They contract and dim along the Hayashi track, decreasing in luminosity but staying at roughly the same temperature, until reaching the main sequence directly or by passing through the Henyey track. Stars evolve relatively slowly along the main sequence as they fuse hydrogen, and after the vast majority of their lifespan, all but the least massive stars become giants. They then evolve quickly towards their stellar endpoints: white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes.\n\nIsochrones can be used to date open clusters because their members all have roughly the same age. If the initial mass function of the open cluster is known, isochrones can be calculated at any age by taking every star in the initial population, using numerical simulations to evolve it forwards to the desired age, and plotting the star’s luminosity and magnitude on the HR diagram. The resulting curve is an isochrone, which can be compared against the observational color-magnitude diagram to determine how well they match. If they match well, the assumed age of the isochrone is close to the actual age of the cluster.\n"}
{"id": "4024093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4024093", "title": "Thermal efficiency", "text": "Thermal efficiency\n\nIn thermodynamics, the thermal efficiency (formula_1) is a dimensionless performance measure of a device that uses thermal energy, such as an internal combustion engine, a steam turbine or a steam engine, a boiler, furnace, or a refrigerator for example. For a heat engine, thermal efficiency is the fraction of the energy added by heat (primary energy) that is converted to net work output (secondary energy). In the case of a refrigeration or heat pump cycle, thermal efficiency is the ratio of net heat output for heating, or removal for cooling, to energy input (the coefficient of performance).\n\nIn general, energy conversion efficiency is the ratio between the useful output of a device and the input, in energy terms. For thermal efficiency, the input, formula_2, to the device is heat, or the heat-content of a fuel that is consumed. The desired output is mechanical work, formula_3, or heat, formula_4, or possibly both. Because the input heat normally has a real financial cost, a memorable, generic definition of thermal efficiency is\n\nFrom the first law of thermodynamics, the energy output cannot exceed the input (nor can it be equal), so\n\nWhen expressed as a percentage, the thermal efficiency must be between 0% and 100%. Efficiency is typically less than 100% because there are inefficiencies such as friction and heat loss that convert the energy into alternative forms. For example, a typical gasoline automobile engine operates at around 25% efficiency, and a large coal-fuelled electrical generating plant peaks at about 46%, advances in Formula 1 motorsport regulations have pushed teams to develop highly efficient power units which peak around 45–50% thermal efficiency. The largest diesel engine in the world peaks at 51.7%. In a combined cycle plant, thermal efficiencies are approaching 60%. Such a real-world value may be used as a figure of merit for the device.\n\nFor engines where a fuel is burned there are two types of thermal efficiency: indicated thermal efficiency and brake thermal efficiency. This efficiency is only appropriate when comparing similar types or similar devices.\n\nFor other systems the specifics of the calculations of efficiency vary but the non dimensional input is still the same. Efficiency = Output energy / input energy\n\nHeat engines transform thermal energy, or heat, \"Q\" into mechanical energy, or work, \"W\". They cannot do this task perfectly, so some of the input heat energy is not converted into work, but is dissipated as waste heat \"Q\" into the environment\n\nThe thermal efficiency of a heat engine is the percentage of heat energy that is transformed into work. Thermal efficiency is defined as\n\nThe efficiency of even the best heat engines is low; usually below 50% and often far below. So the energy lost to the environment by heat engines is a major waste of energy resources, Since a large fraction of the fuels produced worldwide go to powering heat engines, perhaps up to half of the useful energy produced worldwide is wasted in engine inefficiency, although modern cogeneration, combined cycle and energy recycling schemes are beginning to use this heat for other purposes. This inefficiency can be attributed to three causes. There is an overall theoretical limit to the efficiency of any heat engine due to temperature, called the Carnot efficiency. Second, specific types of engines have lower limits on their efficiency due to the inherent irreversibility of the engine cycle they use. Thirdly, the nonideal behavior of real engines, such as mechanical friction and losses in the combustion process causes further efficiency losses.\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics puts a fundamental limit on the thermal efficiency of all heat engines. Even an ideal, frictionless engine can't convert anywhere near 100% of its input heat into work. The limiting factors are the temperature at which the heat enters the engine, formula_9, and the temperature of the environment into which the engine exhausts its waste heat, formula_10, measured in an absolute scale, such as the Kelvin or Rankine scale. From Carnot's theorem, for any engine working between these two temperatures:\n\nThis limiting value is called the Carnot cycle efficiency because it is the efficiency of an unattainable, ideal, reversible engine cycle called the Carnot cycle. No device converting heat into mechanical energy, regardless of its construction, can exceed this efficiency.\n\nExamples of formula_9 are the temperature of hot steam entering the turbine of a steam power plant, or the temperature at which the fuel burns in an internal combustion engine. formula_10 is usually the ambient temperature where the engine is located, or the temperature of a lake or river into which the waste heat is discharged. For example, if an automobile engine burns gasoline at a temperature of formula_14 and the ambient temperature is formula_15, then its maximum possible efficiency is:\n\nIt can be seen that since formula_10 is fixed by the environment, the only way for a designer to increase the Carnot efficiency of an engine is to increase formula_9, the temperature at which the heat is added to the engine. The efficiency of ordinary heat engines also generally increases with operating temperature, and advanced structural materials that allow engines to operate at higher temperatures is an active area of research.\n\nDue to the other causes detailed below, practical engines have efficiencies far below the Carnot limit. For example, the average automobile engine is less than 35% efficient.\n\nCarnot's theorem applies to thermodynamic cycles, where thermal energy is converted to mechanical work. Devices that convert a fuel's chemical energy directly into electrical work, such as fuel cells, can exceed the Carnot efficiency.\nThe Carnot cycle is reversible and thus represents the upper limit on efficiency of an engine cycle. Practical engine cycles are irreversible and thus have inherently lower efficiency than the Carnot efficiency when operated between the same temperatures formula_9 and formula_10. One of the factors determining efficiency is how heat is added to the working fluid in the cycle, and how it is removed. The Carnot cycle achieves maximum efficiency because all the heat is added to the working fluid at the maximum temperature formula_9, and removed at the minimum temperature formula_10. In contrast, in an internal combustion engine, the temperature of the fuel-air mixture in the cylinder is nowhere near its peak temperature as the fuel starts to burn, and only reaches the peak temperature as all the fuel is consumed, so the average temperature at which heat is added is lower, reducing efficiency.\n\nAn important parameter in the efficiency of combustion engines is the specific heat ratio of the air-fuel mixture, \"γ\". This varies somewhat with the fuel, but is generally close to the air value of 1.4. This standard value is usually used in the engine cycle equations below, and when this approximation is made the cycle is called an \"air-standard cycle\". \n\n\nThe above efficiency formulas are based on simple idealized mathematical models of engines, with no friction and working fluids that obey simple thermodynamic rules called the ideal gas law. Real engines have many departures from ideal behavior that waste energy, reducing actual efficiencies far below the theoretical values given above. Examples are:\nAnother source of inefficiency is that engines must be optimized for other goals besides efficiency, such as low pollution. The requirements for vehicle engines are particularly stringent: they must be designed for low emissions, adequate acceleration, fast starting, light weight, low noise, etc. These require compromises in design (such as altered valve timing to reduce emissions) that reduce efficiency. The average automobile engine is only about 35% efficient, and must also be kept idling at stoplights, wasting an additional 17% of the energy, resulting in an overall efficiency of 18%. Large stationary electric generating plants have fewer of these competing requirements as well as more efficient Rankine cycles, so they are significantly more efficient than vehicle engines, around 50% Therefore, replacing internal combustion vehicles with electric vehicles, which run on a battery that is charged with electricity generated by burning fuel in a power plant, has the theoretical potential to increase the thermal efficiency of energy use in transportation, thus decreasing the demand for fossil fuels.\n\nWhen comparing different heat engines as sources of power, such as electric power or the power to run vehicles, the engine efficiency alone is only one factor. To give a meaningful comparison, the overall efficiency of the entire energy supply chain from the fuel source to the consumer must be considered. Although the heat wasted by heat engines is usually the largest source of inefficiency, factors such as the energy cost of fuel refining and transportation, and energy loss in electrical transmission lines to transport it, may offset the advantage of a more efficient heat engine.\n\nFor a device that converts energy from another form into thermal energy (such as an electric heater, boiler, or furnace), the thermal efficiency is\n\nwhere the formula_27 quantities are heat-equivalent values.\n\nSo, for a boiler that produces 210 kW (or 700,000 BTU/h) output for each 300 kW (or 1,000,000 BTU/h) heat-equivalent input, its thermal efficiency is 210/300 = 0.70, or 70%. This means that 30% of the energy is lost to the environment.\n\nAn electric resistance heater has a thermal efficiency close to 100%. When comparing heating units, such as a highly efficient electric resistance heater to an 80% efficient natural gas-fuelled furnace, an economic analysis is needed to determine the most cost-effective choice.\n\nThe heating value of a fuel is the amount of heat released during an exothermic reaction (e.g., combustion) and is a characteristic of each substance. It is measured in units of energy per unit of the substance, usually mass, such as: kJ/kg, J/mol.\n\nThe heating value for fuels is expressed as the HHV, LHV, or GHV to distinguish treatment of the heat of phase changes:\n\n\nWhich definition of heating value is being used significantly affects any quoted efficiency. Not stating whether an efficiency is HHV or LHV renders such numbers very misleading.\n\nHeat pumps, refrigerators and air conditioners use work to move heat from a colder to a warmer place, so their function is the opposite of a heat engine. The work energy (\"W\") that is applied to them is converted into heat, and the sum of this energy and the heat energy that is moved from the cold reservoir (\"Q\") is equal to the total heat energy added to the hot reservoir (\"Q\")\n\nTheir efficiency is measured by a coefficient of performance (COP). Heat pumps are measured by the efficiency with which they add heat to the hot reservoir, COP; refrigerators and air conditioners by the efficiency with which they remove heat from the cold interior, COP:\n\nThe reason the term \"coefficient of performance\" is used instead of \"efficiency\" is that, since these devices are moving heat, not creating it, the amount of heat they move can be greater than the input work, so the COP can be greater than 1 (100%). Therefore, heat pumps can be a more efficient way of heating than simply converting the input work into heat, as in an electric heater or furnace.\n\nSince they are heat engines, these devices are also limited by Carnot's theorem. The limiting value of the Carnot 'efficiency' for these processes, with the equality theoretically achievable only with an ideal 'reversible' cycle, is:\n\nThe same device used between the same temperatures is more efficient when considered as a heat pump than when considered as a refrigerator:\n\nThis is because when heating, the work used to run the device is converted to heat and adds to the desired effect, whereas if the desired effect is cooling the heat resulting from the input work is just an unwanted by-product. Sometimes, the term efficiency is used for the ratio of the achieved COP to the Carnot COP, which can not exceed 100%.\n\nThe 'thermal efficiency' is sometimes called the energy efficiency. In the United States, in everyday usage the SEER is the more common measure of energy efficiency for cooling devices, as well as for heat pumps when in their heating mode. For energy-conversion heating devices their peak steady-state thermal efficiency is often stated, e.g., 'this furnace is 90% efficient', but a more detailed measure of seasonal energy effectiveness is the annual fuel use efficiency (AFUE).\n\nA counter flow heat exchanger is the most efficient type of heat exchanger in transferring heat energy from one circuit to the other. However, for a more complete picture of heat exchanger efficiency, exergetic considerations must be taken into account.thermal efficiency in ic engine is higher than ec engine.\n\n"}

Robert Weller and Russ Davis and commercially produced by EG&G Sealink System (currently EdgeTech).\nThe instrument has the capability of one year long deployment at depths of up to 5000 m. Both laboratory and field test results show that the VMCM is capable of making accurate measurements of horizontal velocity in the upper ocean. The VMCM is the current standard for making high quality velocity measurements in near-surface regions and it has been used for benchmarking other current meters.\n\nThe main components of a VMCM are its two orthogonal cosine response propeller sensors, that directly measure the components of horizontal velocity parallel to their axes. The orientation of the instrument with respect to magnetic north is sensed with a flux-gate compass, which permits to evaluate the direction of flux, providing the angle of the Y axis with respect to the magnetic North.\nA microprocessor rotates the X-Y coordinates in the conventional East-West and North-South components of velocity. This is done once each sample interval and, at the end of the record interval, the conventional components of velocity are averaged and the averages are stored on a cassette magnetic tape. Other components of the system are a bearing retainer, an end cap, an outer bearing race, a ball retainer and bearing balls, an encoder and an epoxy or Noryl plastic disk with four magnets, pressure window, an aluminum disk, two magnetodiodes mounted asymmetrically on a printed circuit ring, a hub, and a shaft with inner races machined in it. The function of the magnetodiodes is detecting the rotation of the propeller sensors.\n\nIncorporated in the system there is the vector averaging electronics, that uses the pulses from the magnetodiodes and the instrument heading from the flux-gate compass to calculate and record the velocity components. In the 1990s, Way et al. upgraded the electronics by redesigning the vector measuring circuitry, data acquisition, and storage components and retaining instead the propeller sensors assembly, which proved to be reliable in the several tests accomplished. A pressure case houses the electronics and the appendage on which the propellers are mounted on.\n\nIn its first design of the late 1970s, a VMCM was approximately 2.56 m high and had a mass of 34.5 kg in air. The original VMCM is no longer commercially available from EG&G (currently EdgeTech). The 1970s electronics components are outdated and difficult, if not impossible, to find. Like many of the electronic components the original flux gate compass is no longer available.\n\nThe innovation brought from VMCM over other current meters results from the choice of the biaxial propeller sensors, developed with accurate cosine response, and the design of the instrument so that flow interference with the instrument body was minimized.\n\n\"Cosine response\" refers to propellers that only respond to the component of flow parallel to their axis of rotation. Their revolution rate is then proportional to the magnitude of the flow times the cosine of the angle between the axle and the flow vector.\nIf the angular response function of the propellers is cosinusoidal, then two such sensors at right angles with their axes in the horizontal plane measure orthogonal components of horizontal velocity directly. No computation of components is necessary (though they are rotated from the instrument reference frame into the conventional east-west and north-south components), and summing the components accomplishes the vector averaging.\n\nThe advantages of a propeller with cosine response have been widely recognized. Weller and Davis designed the propeller sensors and their location within the pressure cage in order to obtain a response as close as possible to an ideal cosinusoidal angular response. After having fabricated and testes several families of propellers, they found the best response in a dual propeller (two propellers fixed on an axle) sensor with two five-bladed, 30-degree pitch propellers with diameter of 22 cm. The propellers are hard anodized, epoxy coated on the exterior, and protected by zinc anodes. They have been made from polycarbonate plastic (LEXAN) and, more recently, from Noryl. Propeller sensors make use of Cartesian coordinate system and provide orthogonal velocity components in the horizontal plane. The measured coordinates need only be rotated in the conventional directions east-west and north-south.\n\nThe pressure case houses the electronics and the appendage on which the propellers are mounted on. It is fabricated from 6A1-4V titanium alloy rod (1.27 cm diameter), which withstand higher yield strength than steel and has a superior resistance to corrosion and metal fatigue in the seawater. Designed in this way, the pressure cage is capable of taking tensions of up to 10,000 pounds and hold the electronics and the propeller sensors in isolation of the tension. This permits a safe working until 5,000 m depth.\n\nEarly on, the propeller bearings were a source of failure. After considerable testing, the bearings were upgraded from polycarbonate plastic to silicon nitride and, as a result of this change, there have not been any bearing failures.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Brian S. Way et al. developed a new version of the VMCM and greatly improved the electronic system. The new version of the VMCM includes as primary subunits the vector measuring front-end (consisting of rotor and compass hardware interface) and a low-power microcontroller to accomplish the sampling. Initial sampling setup (e.g. sample rate, averaging interval, calibration factors) is set by command from an Onset Computer (Tattletale 8, TT8). However, actual sampling and computation of vector averages are handled in the VMCM front-end subunit. A Microchip Technology PIC microcontroller handles all of these tasks, producing current vector North and East (Vn and Ve) reading at the desired interval.\n\nIn standard operation with the new version of VMCM, the PIC microcontroller in the VMCM front-end samples the rotors and compass at the rate set by the TT8 initially. At each sample, rotor and compass readings are accumulated for vector-averaging and, at the chosen sample interval, the vector averages Vn and Ve are relayed to the TT8 for further processing and/or storage.\n\nThe main setup program gives the user the ability to choose from the following commands: record interval, which parameters to log (it is possible to add measurement of other parameters such as temperature, conductivity, oxygen, word time updated with each record, tilt, battery voltage), sample intervals for each selected parameter, start time to begin logging end time to stop logger. In the new version of the VMCM, the ease and flexibility for setting up and adding sensors has decreased the time needed for pre-deployment instrument preparation in port.\n\nThe two orthogonal cosine response propeller sensors directly measure the components of horizontal velocity parallel to their axes. The flux-gate compass senses the orientation of the instrument with respect to magnetic North and permits to evaluate the direction of flux. The microprocessor rotates the coordinates in the conventional East-West and North-South components of velocity. This is done once each sample interval and, at the end of the record interval, the conventional components of velocity are averaged and the averages are stored.\nThe rotation of the propeller sensors is detected by the magnetodiodes. As a result of the asymmetry in placement of the magnetodiodes, a staggered pair of pulses is produced each quarter revolution; the phase relationship indicates the sense of direction of rotation and the pulse rate indicates the rate of rotation.\n\nIn order to calculate and record the velocity components, the vector averaging circuitry is turned on by a rotor count, which is signaled by a proper sequence of changes in the levels of the magnetodiodes. The instrument heading (formula_1) is determined and stored in a register and updated at a 1-Hz rate (once each second). If either propeller rotates sufficiently (the original version of VMCM had a speed threshold of less than one centimeter per second ), a pair of pulses is produced by the magnetodiodes of one hub and a count occurs from the rotor. Then, the cosine and sine of the heading (that is currently stored in the heading register) are added to the proper register that stores the formula_2 and formula_3 velocity components. To accomplish this, at the end of each sampling interval over which the averaging is performed, the following sums are evaluated:\n\nand\n\nwhere N is the number of quarter revolutions by the sensor oriented east-west when formula_1 = 0, M is the number of quarter revolutions by the other sensor, and formula_7 and formula_8 are the headings of the instrument in the heading register when the ith and jth pairs of pulses were supplied by the two propeller sensors. The velocity components are stored in a 12-bit registers and, at the end of each sampling interval, they are written as 16-bit words (12 bits of data, 4 bits identifying the channel) on a flash drive support (in its original design of the late 1970s, a cassette tape with more limited storage capacity was used).\n\nThe instruments typically record average formula_2 and average formula_3 every sample interval and time every hour. Two other channels of information, such as temperature and pressure, can be recorded. Various sample intervals can be selected.\nAs the vector averaging circuitry is turned on only when a pair of magnetodiode pulses occurs, the current drain is proportional to the flow rate of the water.\n\nBased on the intercomparison of the test data obtained from the VMCM and from other measuring instruments such as Aandera, VACM, electromagnetic current meters, and ACM, it has been experienced that VMCM sensor introduces the least error in relatively small mean flows when high frequency oscillatory fluctuations are also present. (because of surface waves, mooring motion, or both). This quality, together with the accuracy of the propeller sensors experienced in steady, unsteady flows, and combinations of both, make the VMCM appropriate to make accurate measurements in the upper ocean.\n"}

These downpours may occur locally in a thunderstorm or over a large area, such as following the landfall of a tropical cyclone. If a washout occurs in a crater-like formation, it is called a sinkhole, and it usually involves a leaking or broken water main or sewerage pipes. Other types of sinkholes, such as collapsed caves, are not washouts.\n\nWidespread washouts can occur in mountainous areas after heavy rains, even in normally dry ravines. A severe washout can become a landslide, or cause a dam break in an earthen dam. Like other forms of erosion, most washouts can be prevented by vegetation whose roots hold the soil and/or slow the flow of surface and underground water. Deforestation increases the risk of washouts. Retaining walls and culverts may be used to try to prevent washouts, although particularly severe washouts may even destroy these if they are not large or strong enough.\n\nIn road and rail transport, a washout is the result of a natural disaster where the roadbed is eroded away by flowing water, usually as the result of a flood. When a washout destroys a railroad's right-of-way, the track is sometimes left suspended in midair across the newly formed gap, or it dips down into a ditch. This phenomenon is discussed in more detail under the term \"erosion\". Bridges may collapse due to bridge scour around one or more bridge abutments or piers.\n\nIn 2004, the remnants of Hurricane Frances, and then Hurricane Ivan, caused a large number of washouts in western North Carolina and other parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains, closing some roads for days and parts of the Blue Ridge Parkway for months. Other washouts have also caused train wrecks where tracks have been unknowingly undermined. Motorists have also driven into flooded streams at night, unaware of a new washout on the road in front of them until it is too late to brake, sometimes prompting a high-water rescue.\n\nMajor washouts can also ruin pipelines or undermine utility poles or underground lines, interrupting public utilities.\n\n"}

It was started in 1947 by Oluf Lund Johansen (1891–1975) as the \"World Radio Handbook\" (WRH). The word \"TV\" was added to the title in 1965, when Jens M. Frost (1919–1999) took over as editor. It had then already included data for television broadcasting for some years. After the 40th edition in 1986, Frost handed over editorship to Andrew G. (Andy) Sennitt.\n\nThe first edition that bears an edition number is the 4th edition, published in 1949. The three previous editions appear to have been:\n\nSummer Supplements appear to have been issued from 1959 through 1971. From 1959 through 1966 they were called the Summer Supplement. From 1967 through 1971 they were called the Summer Edition.\n\nThrough the 1969 edition, the WRTH indicated the date on which the manuscript was completed.\n\nIssues with covers in Danish are known to have been available for the years 1948 May-November (2d ed.), 1950-51 (5th ed.; cover and 1st page in Danish, rest in English, most ads in Danish), 1952 (6th ed.; cover and 1st page in Danish, rest in English, most ads in Danish), and probably others. The 1952 English ed., which is completely in English, has an extra page with world times and agents, and ads in English which are sometimes different from the ads in the Danish edition. Also, the 1953 ed. mentions the availability of a German edition.\n\nOluf Lund Johansen published, in conjunction with Libreria Hispanoamericana of Barcelona, Spain, a softbound Spanish-language version of the 1960 WRTH. The book was printed in Spain and called \"Guia Mundial de Radio y Television\", and carried the WRTH logo at the time as well as all the editorial references contained in the English-language version. \n\nHardbound editions are known to have been available for the years 1963 through 1966, 1968, 1969, and 1975-1978, and probably others.\n\n\n"}

Because they contain at least one positive and one negative charge, zwitterions are also sometimes called inner salts. The charges on the different functional groups balance each other out, and the molecule as a whole is electrically neutral. The pH where this happens is known as the isoelectric point.\n\nUnlike simple amphoteric compounds that may only form \"either\" a cationic or anionic species, a zwitterion simultaneously has both ionic states.\n\nAmino acids are the best-known examples of zwitterions. These compounds contain an ammonium and a carboxylate group, and can be viewed as arising via a kind of intramolecular acid–base reaction: The amine group deprotonates the carboxylic acid.\nThe zwitterionic structure of glycine in the solid state has been confirmed by neutron diffraction measurements. At least in some cases, the zwitterionic form of amino acids also persists in the gas phase.\n\nIn addition to the amino acids, many other compounds that contain both acidic and basic centres tautomerize to the zwitterionic form. Examples, such as bicine and tricine, contain a basic secondary or tertiary amine fragment together with a carboxylic acid fragment. Neutron diffraction measurements show that solid sulfamic acid exists as a zwitterion. Many alkaloids, such as LSD and psilocybin, exist as zwitterions because they contain carboxylates and ammonium centres.\n\nMany zwitterions contain quaternary ammonium cations. Since it lacks N–H bonds, the ammonium center cannot participate in tautomerization. Zwitterions containing quaternary ammonium centers are common in biology; a common example are the betaines, which serve as electrolytes in fish. The membrane-forming phospholipids are also commonly zwitterions. The polar head groups in these compounds are zwitterions, resulting from the presence of the anionic phosphate and cationic quaternary ammonium centres.\n\nThe pH value at the isoelectric point can be calculated from the acid dissociation constants of the acidic and basic groups of the zwitterion (except at high dilution):\nDerivation:\n\nThe acid dissociation constants are defined as:\nMultiplication of these two equations eliminates the concentration of the zwitterion:\nBecause the concentrations of the anion and cation are equal at the isoelectric point, the equation simplifies to:\nTaking the square root and logarithm on both sides yields:\n\nIn the case of acidic amino acids (e.g. aspartic acid) or basic amino acids (e.g. lysine), the p\"K\" values of the two similar groups are taken into consideration: in the case of amino acids with basic side chains, the side chain and the amino group can both take a positive charge at low pH values, and in the case of amino acids with acidic side chains, the two carboxylic acid groups can both take a negative charge at high pH values. The molecule is therefore neutral halfway between these two p\"K\" values, when one of the two similar groups is neutral, so the p\"K\" values of the two similar groups are substituted into the equation above and the average is taken, for example for lysine: = 9.74 and for aspartic acid: = 2.98.\n\nThe resonance structures that are used to represent the charge delocalization of dipolar compounds frequently include zwitterions, even when there is not complete separation of charges like with a stable zwitterion. Zwitterionic compounds, on the other hand, have stable, separated unit electrical charges on atoms.\n\nAlso related are mesoionic compounds, which are dipolar heterocyclic compounds in which both the negative and the positive charge are delocalized.\n"}
