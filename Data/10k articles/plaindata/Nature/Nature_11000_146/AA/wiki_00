While still a teenager, she joined an expedition to travel around the world by Ford 1918 Model T, 1930 Model A, and a 1935 Touring Sedan — all Fords — and continuing to use Fords until her passing in 1996.\n\nAloha began her adventuring career when she met her traveling companion, Walter \"Cap\" Wanderwell, in 1922. They married in 1925 and had two children. As they continued to travel the world, Aloha performed on stage doing travel lectures while next to her a silent movie, \"Car and Camera Around the World\", played. The Wanderwells recorded their world journeys on 35mm nitrate and 16mm film, which all reside in the vaults at The Academy Film Archives, Hollywood, California USA. While stranded in Brazil, she lived among the Bororo people and recorded the earliest film documentation of them for 6 weeks. In 1932, her husband was shot and killed on his yacht \"Carma\" in Long Beach, California. Aloha later married Walter Baker and continued her travels, ultimately visiting over 80 countries and six continents, and driving over 500,000 miles all in Fords.\n\n\"First Female to Drive Around the World\" 1922-1927 Guinness World Records.\n\nThe first female to drive around the world was achieved by Aloha Wanderwell (USA/Canada) who traveled the world in a Ford Model T, starting and ending in Nice, France, between 29 December 1922 and January 1927.\nAloha traveled as driver, translator and film maker for the Wanderwell Expeditions, a round-the-world motoring tour led by Walter \"Cap\" Wanderwell (Poland).\n\nIdris Galcia Welsh was born on 13 October 1906 in Winnipeg, Manitoba to Margaret Headley and Robert Welsh. In 1909, her mother married Herbert Hall, and her name was changed to Idris Hall. Her step-father was a developer and rancher on Vancouver Island and the family lived in Parksville and Duncan. In 1914, at the start of the First World War, her step-father joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force and after arriving in England was transferred to the British Army and made a lieutenant in the Durham Light Infantry. The family (Idris, her sister Margret \"Miki\" Hall, and their mother) followed him to Europe, where they traveled around England, Belgium, and France. In June 1917, Herbert Hall was killed in combat in Ypres, Belgium.\n\nHoping to tame Idris's tomboyish tendencies, her mother sent her to boarding schools, first to Benedictine Soeurs du Saint-Sacrement in Courtrai, Belgium, later to Chateau Neuf in Nice.\n\nIn 1921, Walter Wanderwell was capturing headlines with the Million Dollar Wager, a round-the-world endurance race between two teams racing Ford Model Ts to see which team could visit the most countries. A controversial figure, Wanderwell (born Valerian Johannes Pieczynski) had been jailed in the United States during World War I on suspicion of being a German spy, but was released in 1918. Wanderwell was inspired by his meeting with the League of Nations and around 1930 he formed his own organization Work Around the World Educational Club or (WAWEC).\n\nIn 1922, when she was 16, Idris met Walter Wanderwell for the first time, after responding to one of his advertisements declaring \"Brains, Beauty & Breeches – World Tour Offer For Lucky Young Woman…. Wanted to join an expedition… Asia, Africa…\" She met with \"Captain\" Wanderwell in Paris and secured a seat on the expedition. She served as the expedition's translator, driver and secretary, and took on the name \"Aloha Wanderwell,\" even though Walter was still married to Nell at the time, but divorced after Aloha joined the expedition.\n\nPartially sponsored by the Ford Motor Company, the round-the-world tour also sustained itself through filming and travel lectures, from Africa through the Middle East and on to Asia. In Calcutta in 1924, their tour crossed paths with planes from the first aerial circumnavigation, and Aloha filmed their meeting.\n\nThey came to the United States in January 1925. Aloha would become an American citizen and marry Wanderwell on April 7, 1925 in Riverside, California. Their marriage foiled a plan by FBI agents to arrest Pieczynski under the Mann Act, a law that prohibits transporting women across state lines for \"immoral purposes.\"\n\nAloha gave birth to a daughter, Valri, in December, 1925 and son Nile in April, 1927. The Wanderwells continued their travels, sailing to Cuba and South Africa. Aside from dealing with poor roads, the Wanderwells also had difficulty finding gasoline for their vehicles. During their travels through Africa from 1926–1928, they used crushed bananas for grease and elephant fat for engine oil. The global tour included 43 countries. Author Stookie Allen contends that during this time, Hall cut her hair and fought as a member of the French Foreign Legion.\n\nThe Wanderwells returned to the United States where they made a home in Miami in 1929 and donated one of their Model Ts, known as \"Little Lizzie\", to Henry Ford before the screening of the film, \"Car and Camera Around the World\". In 1942, Henry Ford decided that \"Little Lizzie\" and 50 other autos would be scrapped for the war effort.\n\nIn 1930 and 1931, Aloha learned to fly a German seaplane, \"Junker\" that she would later land on an uncharted part of the Amazon River when the Wanderwells traveled to the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil. They set up camp at the Descalvados Ranch in Cuiabá and were ostensibly searching for lost explorer Colonel Percival Harrison Fawcett, who was looking for the legendary Lost City of Z (some speculate this to either be synonymous or different to the legendary city of Eldorado). They made several flights with a seaplane, once running out of fuel on the Paraguay River and receiving help from the Bororo people. The crew's cameraman filmed a ceremonial dance, a first contact scenario with Boboré villagers, and Bororo men experiencing sympathetic labor pains. The 32-minute silent film called \"Last of the Bororos\" is preserved in the Smithsonian Institution's Human Studies Film Archives and includes Aloha's meeting with Brazilian explorer Cândido Rondon.\n\nIn late 1932, the couple purchased a yacht, the 110-foot \"Carma\", intending to document their voyage to the South Seas on film. On December 5, 1932, the day before they were to embark, Walter Wanderwell was murdered on the yacht in the harbor near Long Beach, California. William James Guy, a member of their 1931 expedition to South America who had attempted to mutiny on a previous voyage, was tried for the crime. Guy had an alibi and was acquitted by the jury and Judge Kenny. Another man, Edward Eugene Fernando Montague, was briefly considered a suspect, but was never charged.\n\nAloha later married Walter Baker in Louisiana The couple traveled to New Zealand, Australia, Hawaii, India, Cambodia, Wyoming USA & Indochina, with Aloha later recounting being surrounded by five herds of elephants and having to shoot their way out. Her final films include \"To See the World by Car\" (1935–37), \"India Now\", and \"Explorers of the Purple Sage, in Technicolor\", which contains the only known footage of Desert Dust, the famous palomino wild horse. All films were made with Walter Baker.\n\nShe continued to give lectures and wrote an autobiographical account of her travels, \"Call to Adventure!\", published in 1939, and later republished in 2012. The couple eventually settled in Cincinnati, Ohio where Wanderwell worked in radio broadcasting, WlW Radio 1939, and print journalism. In 1947, she and Walter Baker moved to Lido Isle community in Newport Beach, California. Aloha gave her final performance in front of 150 family members and guests, with Dr. Pete Lee, curator at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles in 1982. She died on June 4, 1996.\n\nFootage by Aloha Wanderwell, is held at the Academy Film Archive and AMPAS. in the Aloha Wanderwell Baker Film Collection. The Academy Film Archive has preserved approx. 66 cans,1000' each of film 35mm Nitrate and 16mm, including rare 1920s and 1930s footage.\n\n\n\n"}

This is an area of low, flat, boggy coastal plains. The underlying soil of this damp Arctic coast is thick, solid permafrost, covered in summer with thermokarst \"thaw lakes\" of melted ice. Ice features such as ice wedges and pingo mounds of soil and ice can be found. This coast has an arctic climate warm enough to allow plant growth in late-June, July and August only, and even then frosts may occur. On the whole this is a damper, wetter area than the Low Arctic tundra ecoregion that continues along the coast west of here to Quebec.\n\nThis area supports wetland plants especially sedges and grasses, mosses and lichens, and right on the coast there are peat bogs. Trees such as dwarf birch, willows, northern Labrador tea (Dryas) and alders grow in the warmer areas of the region, the Mackenzie River delta and the Yukon coast.\n\nThis region provides calving habitat for four herds of caribou, the Western Arctic, Teshekpuk, Central Arctic, and Porcupine caribou herds. Another key species is the muskox of Banks Island and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coast. Other mammals include lemmings, polar bear, walrus, beluga whale, snowshoe hare and Arctic hare, red fox, grey wolf, Arctic ground squirrel and seals. The coast is also home to many breeding waterbirds including snow goose, spectacled eider, Steller's eider, king eider, and yellow-billed loon. Important bird areas include the Colville River delta, Teshekpuk Lake (which is within the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska), and Kasegaluk Lagoon a breeding area for brant goose. Predatory birds include the snowy owls that hunt waterbirds and lemmings. Fish of the waters here include the Arctic char.\n\n90% of natural habitat remains intact, except for the vicinity of Utqiagvik, Alaska and the oil fields of Prudhoe Bay, Alaska and Kuparuk which are expanding along the coast and may in future spread into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which is the only major protected area on this coast (see Arctic Refuge drilling controversy), and on and around the Dalton Highway and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\n\n"}

{"id": "1026522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1026522", "title": "Boltzmann equation", "text": "Boltzmann equation\n\nThe Boltzmann equation or Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) describes the statistical behaviour of a thermodynamic system not in a state of equilibrium, devised by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1872.\nThe classic example of such a system is a fluid with temperature gradients in space causing heat to flow from hotter regions to colder ones, by the random but biased transport of the particles making up that fluid. In the modern literature the term Boltzmann equation is often used in a more general sense, referring to any kinetic equation that describes the change of a macroscopic quantity in a thermodynamic system, such as energy, charge or particle number.\n\nThe equation arises not by analyzing the individual positions and momenta of each particle in the fluid but rather by considering a probability distribution for the position and momentum of a typical particle—that is, the probability that the particle occupies a given very small region of space (mathematically written formula_1, where formula_2 means \"differential\") centered at the position formula_3, and has momentum nearly equal to a given momentum vector formula_4 (thus occupying a very small region of momentum space formula_5), at an instant of time.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation can be used to determine how physical quantities change, such as heat energy and momentum, when a fluid is in transport. One may also derive other properties characteristic to fluids such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity (by treating the charge carriers in a material as a gas). See also convection-diffusion equation.\n\nThe equation is a nonlinear integro-differential equation, and the unknown function in the equation is a probability density function in six-dimensional space of a particle position and momentum. The problem of existence and uniqueness of solutions is still not fully resolved, but some recent results are quite promising.\n\nThe set of all possible positions r and momenta p is called the phase space of the system; in other words a set of three coordinates for each position coordinate \"x, y, z\", and three more for each momentum component \"p, p, p\". The entire space is 6-dimensional: a point in this space is (r, p) = (\"x, y, z, p, p, p\"), and each coordinate is parameterized by time \"t\". The small volume (\"differential volume element\") is written \n\nSince the probability of \"N\" molecules which \"all\" have r and p within formula_7 formula_8 is in question, at the heart of the equation is a quantity \"f\" which gives this probability per unit phase-space volume, or probability per unit length cubed per unit momentum cubed, at an instant of time \"t\". This is a probability density function: \"f\"(r, p, \"t\"), defined so that,\n\nis the number of molecules which \"all\" have positions lying within a volume element formula_10 about r and momenta lying within a momentum space element formula_8 about p, at time \"t\". Integrating over a region of position space and momentum space gives the total number of particles which have positions and momenta in that region:\n\nwhich is a 6-fold integral. While \"f\" is associated with a number of particles, the phase space is for one-particle (not all of them, which is usually the case with deterministic many-body systems), since only one r and p is in question. It is not part of the analysis to use r, p for particle 1, r, p for particle 2, etc. up to r, p for particle \"N\".\n\nIt is assumed the particles in the system are identical (so each has an identical mass \"m\"). For a mixture of more than one chemical species, one distribution is needed for each, see below.\n\nThe general equation can then be written as\n\nwhere the \"force\" term corresponds to the forces exerted on the particles by an external influence (not by the particles themselves), the \"diff\" term represents the diffusion of particles, and \"coll\" is the collision term – accounting for the forces acting between particles in collisions. Expressions for each term on the right side are provided below.\n\nNote that some authors use the particle velocity v instead of momentum p; they are related in the definition of momentum by p = \"m\"v.\n\nConsider particles described by \"f\", each experiencing an \"external\" force F not due to other particles (see the collision term for the latter treatment).\n\nSuppose at time \"t\" some number of particles all have position r within element formula_10 and momentum p within formula_15. If a force F instantly acts on each particle, then at time \"t\" + Δ\"t\" their position will be r + Δr = r + pΔ\"t\"/\"m\" and momentum p + Δp = p + FΔ\"t\". Then, in the absence of collisions, \"f\" must satisfy\n\nNote that we have used the fact that the phase space volume element formula_10 formula_15 is constant, which can be shown using Hamilton's equations (see the discussion under Liouville's theorem). However, since collisions do occur, the particle density in the phase-space volume formula_10 'formula_15 changes, so\n\n& = \\Delta f \\, d^3\\mathbf{r} \\, d^3\\mathbf{p} \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere Δ\"f\" is the \"total\" change in \"f\". Dividing () by formula_10 formula_15 Δ\"t\" and taking the limits Δ\"t\" → 0 and Δ\"f\" → 0, we have\n\nThe total differential of \"f\" is:\n\n\\cdot d\\mathbf{p} \\\\[5pt]\n& = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}dt +\\nabla f \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{p}}{m}dt + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mathbf{p}}\\cdot \\mathbf{F} \\, dt\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere ∇ is the gradient operator, · is the dot product,\n\nis a shorthand for the momentum analogue of ∇, and ê, ê, ê are Cartesian unit vectors.\n\nDividing () by \"dt\" and substituting into () gives:\n\nIn this context, F(r, \"t\") is the force field acting on the particles in the fluid, and \"m\" is the mass of the particles. The term on the right hand side is added to describe the effect of collisions between particles; if it is zero then the particles do not collide. The collisionless Boltzmann equation is often called the Vlasov equation.\n\nThis equation is more useful than the principal one above, yet still incomplete, since \"f\" cannot be solved unless the collision term in \"f\" is known. This term cannot be found as easily or generally as the others – it is a statistical term representing the particle collisions, and requires knowledge of the statistics the particles obey, like the Maxwell–Boltzmann, Fermi–Dirac or Bose–Einstein distributions.\n\nA key insight applied by Boltzmann was to determine the collision term resulting solely from two-body collisions between particles that are assumed to be uncorrelated prior to the collision. This assumption was referred to by Boltzmann as the \"\" and is also known as the \"molecular chaos assumption\". Under this assumption the collision term can be written as a momentum-space integral over the product of one-particle distribution functions:\nwhere p and p are the momenta of any two particles (labeled as \"A\" and \"B\" for convenience) before a collision, p′ and p′ are the momenta after the collision,\nis the magnitude of the relative momenta (see relative velocity for more on this concept), and \"I\"(\"g\", Ω) is the differential cross section of the collision, in which the relative momenta of the colliding particles turns through an angle θ into the element of the solid angle \"d\"Ω, due to the collision.\n\nSince much of the challenge in solving the Boltzmann equation originates with the complex collision term, attempts have been made to \"model\" and simplify the collision term. The best known model equation is due to Bhatnagar, Gross and Krook. The assumption in the BGK approximation is that the effect of molecular collisions is to force a non-equilibrium distribution function at a point in physical space back to a Maxwellian equilibrium distribution function and that the rate at which this occurs is proportional to the molecular collision frequency. The Boltzmann equation is therefore modified to the BGK form:\n\nwhere formula_28 is the molecular collision frequency, and formula_29 is the local Maxwellian distribution function given the gas temperature at this point in space.\n\nFor a mixture of chemical species labelled by indices \"i\" = 1, 2, 3, ..., \"n\" the equation for species \"i\" is\n\nwhere \"f\" = \"f\"(r, p, \"t\"), and the collision term is\n\nwhere \"f′\" = \"f′\"(p′, \"t\"), the magnitude of the relative momenta is\n\nand \"I\" is the differential cross-section, as before, between particles \"i\" and \"j\". The integration is over the momentum components in the integrand (which are labelled \"i\" and \"j\"). The sum of integrals describes the entry and exit of particles of species \"i\" in or out of the phase-space element. \n\nThe Boltzmann equation can be used to derive the fluid dynamic conservation laws for mass, charge, momentum and energy. For a fluid consisting of only one kind of particle, the number density \"n\" is given by\n\nThe average value of any function \"A\" is\n\nSince the conservation equations involve tensors, the Einstein summation convention will be used where repeated indices in a product indicate summation over those indices. Thus formula_35 and formula_36, where formula_37 is the particle velocity vector. Define formula_38 as some function of momentum formula_39 only, which is conserved in a collision. Assume also that the force formula_40 is a function of position only, and that \"f\" is zero for formula_41. Multiplying the Boltzmann equation by \"A\" and integrating over momentum yields four terms, which, using integration by parts, can be expressed as\n\nwhere the last term is zero, since \"A\" is conserved in a collision. Letting formula_46, the mass of the particle, the integrated Boltzmann equation becomes the conservation of mass equation:\n\nwhere formula_48 is the mass density, and formula_49 is the average fluid velocity.\n\nLetting formula_50, the momentum of the particle, the integrated Boltzmann equation becomes the conservation of momentum equation:\n\nwhere formula_52 is the pressure tensor (the viscous stress tensor plus the hydrostatic pressure).\n\nLetting formula_53, the kinetic energy of the particle, the integrated Boltzmann equation becomes the conservation of energy equation:\n\nwhere formula_55 is the kinetic thermal energy density, and formula_56 is the heat flux vector.\n\nIn Hamiltonian mechanics, the Boltzmann equation is often written more generally as\nwhere L is the Liouville operator (there is an inconsistent definition between the Liouville operator as defined here and the one in the article linked) describing the evolution of a phase space volume and C is the collision operator. The non-relativistic form of L is\n\nIt is possible to write down relativistic quantum Boltzmann equations for relativistic quantum systems in which the number of particles is not conserved in collisions. This has several applications in physical cosmology, including the formation of the light elements in big bang nucleosynthesis, the production of dark matter and baryogenesis. It is not a priori clear that the state of a quantum system can be characterized by a classical phase space density \"f\". However, for a wide class of applications a well-defined generalization of \"f\" exists which is the solution of an effective Boltzmann equation that can be derived from first principles of quantum field theory.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is of use in galactic dynamics. A galaxy, under certain assumptions, may be approximated as a continuous fluid; its mass distribution is then represented by \"f\"; in galaxies, physical collisions between the stars are very rare, and the effect of \"gravitational collisions\" can be neglected for times far longer than the age of the universe.\n\nIts generalization in general relativity. is\n\nwhere Γ is the Christoffel symbol of the second kind (this assumes there are no external forces, so that particles move along geodesics in the absence of collisions), with the important subtlety that the density is a function in mixed contravariant-covariant (\"x, p\") phase space as opposed to fully contravariant (\"x, p\") phase space.\n\nIn physical cosmology the fully covariant approach has been used to study the cosmic microwave background radiation. More generically the study of processes in the early universe often attempt to take into account the effects of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In the very dense medium formed by the primordial plasma after the big bang, particles are continuously created and annihilated. In such an environment quantum coherence and the spatial extension of the wavefunction can affect the dynamics, making it questionable whether the classical phase space distribution \"f\" that appears in the Boltzmann equation is suitable to describe the system. In many cases it is, however, possible to derive an effective Boltzmann equation for a generalized distribution function from first principles of quantum field theory. This includes the formation of the light elements in big bang nucleosynthesis, the production of dark matter and baryogenesis.\n\nExact solutions to the Boltzmann equations have been proven to exist in some cases; this analytical approach provides insight, but is not generally usable in practical problems.\n\nInstead, numerical methods (including finite elements) are generally used to find approximate solutions to the various forms of the Boltzmann equation. Example applications range from hypersonic aerodynamics in rarefied gas flows to plasma flows.\n\nClose to local equilibrium, solution of the Boltzmann equation can be represented by an asymptotic expansion in powers of Knudsen number (the Chapman-Enskog expansion). The first two terms of this expansion give the Euler equations and the Navier-Stokes equations. The higher terms have singularities. The problem of developing mathematically the limiting processes, which lead from the atomistic view (represented by Boltzmann's equation) to the laws of motion of continua, is an important part of Hilbert's sixth problem.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2533237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2533237", "title": "Catalytic triad", "text": "Catalytic triad\n\nA catalytic triad is a set of three coordinated amino acids that can be found in the active site of some enzymes. Catalytic triads are most commonly found in hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and β-lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to release the product and regenerate free enzyme. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine or even selenocysteine. The 3D structure of the enzyme brings together the triad residues in a precise orientation, even though they may be far apart in the sequence (primary structure).\n\nAs well as divergent evolution of function (and even the triad's nucleophile), catalytic triads show some of the best examples of convergent evolution. Chemical constraints on catalysis have led to the same catalytic solution independently evolving in at least 23 separate superfamilies. Their mechanism of action is consequently one of the best studied in biochemistry.\n\nThe enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin were first purified in the 1930s. A serine in each of trypsin and chymotrypsin was identified as the catalytic nucleophile (by diisopropyl fluorophosphate modification) in the 1950s. The structure of chymotrypsin was solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1960s, showing the orientation of the catalytic triad in the active site. Other proteases were sequenced and aligned to reveal a family of related proteases, now called the S1 family. Simultaneously, the structures of the evolutionarily unrelated papain and subtilisin proteases were found to contain analogous triads. The 'charge-relay' mechanism for the activation of the nucleophile by the other triad members was proposed in the late 1960s. As more protease structures were solved by X-ray crystallography in the 1970s and 80s, homologous (such as TEV protease) and analogous (such as papain) triads were found. The MEROPS classification system in the 1990s and 2000s began classing proteases into structurally related enzyme superfamilies and so acts as a database of the convergent evolution of triads in over 20 superfamilies. Understanding how chemical constraints on evolution led to the convergence of so many enzyme families on the same triad geometries has developed in the 2010s.\n\nSince their initial discovery, there have been increasingly detailed investigations of their exact catalytic mechanism. Of particular contention in the 1990s and 2000s was whether low-barrier hydrogen bonding contributed to catalysis, or whether ordinary hydrogen bonding is sufficient to explain the mechanism. The massive body of work on the charge-relay, covalent catalysis used by catalytic triads has led to the mechanism being the best characterised in all of biochemistry.\n\nEnzymes that contain a catalytic triad use it for one of two reaction types: either to split a substrate (hydrolases) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate (transferases). Triads are an inter-dependent set of residues in the active site of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. binding site and oxyanion hole) to achieve nucleophilic catalysis. These triad residues act together to make the nucleophile member highly reactive, generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.\n\nCatalytic triads perform covalent catalysis using a residue as a nucleophile. The reactivity of the nucleophilic residue is increased by the functional groups of the other triad members. The nucleophile is polarised and oriented by the base, which is itself bound and stabilised by the acid.\n\nCatalysis is performed in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen to accept an electron, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an oxyanion hole within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting the first half of the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The ejection of this first leaving group is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.\n\nThe second stage of catalysis is the resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate. If this substrate is water then the result is hydrolysis; if it is an organic molecule then the result is transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate. Attack by this second substrate forms a new tetrahedral intermediate, which resolves by ejecting the enzyme's nucleophile, releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme.\n\nThe side-chain of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent catalysis on the substrate. The lone pair of electrons present on the oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive carbonyl carbon. The 20 naturally occurring biological amino acids do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult catalytic reactions. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the hydroxyl (OH) of serine and the thiol/thiolate ion (SH/S) of cysteine. Alternatively, threonine proteases use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine, however due to steric hindrance of the side chain's extra methyl group such proteases use their \"N\"-terminal amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.\n\nUse of oxygen or sulphur as the nucleophilic atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to oxygen, sulphur’s extra d orbital makes it larger (by 0.4 Å) and softer, allows it to form longer bonds (d and d by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower p\"K\" (by 5 units). Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its p\"K\" in order to achieve concerted deprotonation with catalysis. The low p\"K\" of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first tetrahedral intermediate as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product. The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to protonate the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S. Sterically, the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier van der Waals radius and if mutated to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.\n\nVery rarely, the selenium atom of the uncommon amino acid selenocysteine is used as a nucleophile. The deprotonated Se state is strongly favoured when in a catalytic triad.\n\nSince no natural amino acids are strongly nucleophilic, the base in a catalytic triad polarises and deprotonates the nucleophile to increase its reactivity. Additionally, it protonates the first product to aid leaving group departure.\n\nThe base is most commonly histidine since its p\"K\" allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue. β-lactamases such as TEM-1 use a lysine residue as the base. Because lysine's p\"K\" is so high (p\"K\"=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle. Threonine proteases use their \"N\"-terminal amide as the base, since steric crowding by the catalytic threonine's methyl prevents other residues from being close enough.\n\nThe acidic triad member forms a hydrogen bond with the basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) and so are the most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.\n\nThe Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif is one of the most thoroughly characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry. The triad is exemplified by chymotrypsin, a model serine protease from the PA superfamily which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the p\"K\" of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an oxyanion hole consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.\n\nThe same triad has also convergently evolved in α/β hydrolases such as some lipases and esterases, however orientation of the triad members is reversed. Additionally, brain acetyl hydrolase (which has the same fold as a small G-protein) has also been found to have this triad. The equivalent Ser-His-\"Glu \"triad is used in acetylcholinesterase.\n\nThe second most studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several families of cysteine proteases use this triad set, for example TEV protease and papain. The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, with a few notable differences. Due to cysteine's low p\"K\", the importance of the Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. hepatitis A virus protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain). This triad is also used by some amidases, such as \"N\"-glycanase to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.\n\nThe triad of cytomegalovirus protease uses histidine as both the acid and base triad members. Removing the acid histidine results in only a 10-fold activity loss (compared to >10,000-fold when aspartate is removed from chymotrypsin). This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.\n\nAn unusual triad is found in seldolisin proteases. The low p\"K\" of the glutamate carboxylate group means that it only acts as a base in the triad at very low pH. The triad is hypothesised to be an adaptation to specific environments like acidic hot springs (e.g. kumamolysin) or cell lysosome (e.g. tripeptidyl peptidase).\n\nThe endothelial protease vasohibin uses a cysteine as the nucleophile, but a serine to coordinate the histidine base. Despite the serine being a poor acid, it is still effective in orienting the histidine in the catalytic triad. Some homologues alternatively have a threonine instead of serine at the acid location.\n\nThreonine proteases, such as the proteasome protease subunit and ornithine acyltransferases use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine in a manner analogous to the use of the serine primary hydroxyl. However, due to the steric interference of the extra methyl group of threonine, the base member of the triad is the \"N\"-terminal amide which polarises an ordered water which, in turn, deprotonates the catalytic hydroxyl to increase its reactivity. Similarly, there exist equivalent 'serine only' and 'cysteine only' configurations such as penicillin acylase G and penicillin acylase V which are evolutionarily related to the proteasome proteases. Again, these use their \"N\"-terminal amide as a base.\n\nThis unusual triad occurs only in one superfamily of amidases. In this case, the lysine acts to polarise the middle serine. The middle serine then forms two strong hydrogen bonds to the nucleophilic serine to activate it (one with the side chain hydroxyl and the other with the backbone amide). The middle serine is held in an unusual \"cis\" orientation to facilitate precise contacts with the other two triad residues. The triad is further unusual in that the lysine and \"cis\"-serine both act as the base in activating the catalytic serine, but the same lysine also performs the role of the acid member as well as making key structural contacts.\n\nThe rare, but naturally occurring amino acid selenocysteine (Sec), can also be found as the nucleophile in some catalytic triads. Selenocysteine is similar to cysteine, but contains a selenium atom instead of a sulphur. An example is in the active site of thioredoxin reductase, which uses the selenium for reduction of disulphide in thioredoxin.\n\nIn addition to naturally occurring types of catalytic triads, protein engineering has been used to create enzyme variants with non-native amino acids, or entirely synthetic amino acids. Catalytic triads have also been inserted into otherwise non-catalytic proteins, or protein mimics.\n\nSubtilisin (a serine protease) has had its oxygen nucleophile replaced with each of sulphur, selenium, or tellurium. Cysteine and selenocysteine were inserted by mutagenesis, whereas the non-natural amino acid, tellurocysteine, was inserted using auxotrophic cells fed with synthetic tellurocysteine. These elements are all in the 16th periodic table column (chalcogens), so have similar properties. In each case, changing the nucleophile reduced the enzyme's protease activity, but increased a different activity. A sulphur nucleophile improved the enzymes transferase activity (sometimes called subtiligase). Selenium and tellurium nucleophiles converted the enzyme into a oxidoreductase. When the nucleophile of TEV protease was converted from cysteine to serine, it protease activity was strongly reduced, but was able to be restored by directed evolution.\n\nNon-catalytic proteins have been used as scaffolds, having catalytic triads inserted into them which were then improved by directed evolution. The Ser-His-Asp triad has been inserted into an antibody, as well as a range of other proteins. Similarly, catalytic triad mimics have been created in small organic molecules like diaryl diselenide, and displayed on larger polymers like Merrifield resins, and self-assembling short peptide nanostructures.\n\nThe sophistication of the active site network causes residues involved in catalysis (and residues in contact with these) to be highly evolutionarily conserved. However, there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic triads, both in the reaction catalysed, and the residues used in catalysis. The triad remains the core of the active site, but it is evolutionarily adapted to serve different functions. Some proteins, called pseudoenzymes, have non-catalytic functions (e.g. regulation by inhibitory binding) and have accumulated mutations that inactivate their catalytic triad.\n\nCatalytic triads perform covalent catalysis via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate is resolved by water, the result is hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a transferase. For example, attack by an acyl group results in an acyltransferase reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate. In different members of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily, the Ser-His-Asp triad is tuned by surrounding residues to perform at least 17 different reactions. Some of these reactions are also achieved with mechanisms that have altered formation, or resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, or that don't proceed via an acyl-enzyme intermediate.\n\nAdditionally, an alternative transferase mechanism has been evolved by amidophosphoribosyltransferases, which has two active sites. In the first active site, a cysteine triad hydrolyses a glutamine substrate to release free ammonia. The ammonia then diffuses though an internal tunnel in the enzyme to the second active site, where it is transferred to a second substrate.\n\nDivergent evolution of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease superfamilies have evolved from one nucleophile to another. This can be inferred when a superfamily (with the same fold) contains families that use different nucleophiles. Such nucleophile switches have occurred several times during evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.\n\nWithin protease superfamilies that contain a mixture of nucleophiles (e.g. the PA clan), families are designated by their catalytic nucleophile (C=cysteine proteases, S=serine proteases).\nThe enzymology of proteases provides some of the clearest known examples of convergent evolution. The same geometric arrangement of triad residues occurs in over 20 separate enzyme superfamilies. Each of these superfamilies is the result of convergent evolution for the same triad arrangement within a different structural fold. This is because there are limited productive ways to arrange three triad residues, the enzyme backbone and the substrate. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical and physical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to repeatedly and independently converge on equivalent solutions.\n\nThe same triad geometries been converged upon by serine proteases such as the chymotrypsin and subtilisin superfamilies. Similar convergent evolution has occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral C3 protease and papain superfamilies. These triads have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in cysteine and serine proteolysis mechanisms.\n\nFamilies of Cysteine proteases\nFamilies of Serine proteases\nThreonine proteases use the amino acid threonine as their catalytic nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary hydroxyl (i.e. has a methyl group). This methyl group greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate as the methyl clashes with either the enzyme backbone or histidine base. When the nucleophile of a serine protease was mutated to threonine, the methyl occupied a mixture of positions, most of which prevented substrate binding. Consequently, the catalytic residue of a threonine protease is located at it \"N\"-terminus.\n\nTwo evolutionarily independent enzyme superfamilies with different protein folds are known to use the \"N\"-terminal residue as a nucleophile: Superfamily PB (proteasomes using the Ntn fold) and Superfamily PE (acetyltransferases using the DOM fold) This commonality of active site structure in completely different protein folds indicates that the active site evolved convergently in those superfamilies.\n\nFamilies of threonine proteases\n"}

{"id": "16682228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16682228", "title": "EICA hypothesis", "text": "EICA hypothesis\n\nThe evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis was first proposed by Bernd Blossey and Rolf Nötzold in 1995 as a way to explain the success of invasive, non-indigenous species (in particular, plants). Observing that:\nBecause of a lack of native predation, the scientists reasoned, introduced plants are able to reallocate resources from defense mechanisms into growth and development. Introduced plants can thereby evolve to grow taller, produce more biomass, and yield more viable offspring than their native counterparts, according to the hypothesis.\n\nBlossey and Nötzold tested their hypothesis on \"Lythrum salicaria\" (purple loosetrife) by potting seeds from plants growing in Ithaca, New York, U.S.A., and Lucelle, Switzerland. The seeds were allowed to germinate in a lab at Christian-Albrechts University in Kiel, northern Germany, and observed for two years. True to the predictions of the EICA Hypothesis, the plants derived from Ithaca produced significantly more biomass that the plants derived from Lucelle. The \"Lythrum salicaria\" plants derived from Ithaca also grew taller and were significantly less resistant to the root-feeding weevil present over its native range.\n\nUnlike the notable ideas (concerning the success of invasive non-indigenous organisms) that preceded it, such as the enemy release hypothesis (ERH) and Charles Darwin's Habituation Hypothesis, the EICA hypothesis postulates that an invasive species is \"not\" as fit (in its introduced habitat) at its moment of introduction as it is at the time that it is considered invasive. As suggested by the name of the hypothesis (Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability), the hypothesis predicts that much of the invasive potential of an invasive species is derived from its ability to evolve to reallocate its resources.\n\nThis idea is troubling in that it adds a new variable to \"invasive potential\", making it harder to predict whether or not a species will become invasive if it is introduced into a new area. In other words, the EICA hypothesis presents a new environmental safety concern. If its postulates hold, in the long run, introduced species may have to be more highly regulated than they are at present, because no set of traits or pattern of introduction can predict the extent to which an organism can reallocate its resources in response to a release from stress.\n\nSince its debut in 1995, Bernd Blossey and Rolf Nötzold's paper, \"Evolution of increased competitive ability in invasive nonindigenous plants: a hypothesis\" has been met with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The paper has been cited in over 368 articles in scientific journals, including review articles, tests of the hypothesis using different model species, and expansions and reformulations of the hypothesis. Among the model species on which the hypothesis has been evaluated most recently (in its original form) are \"Solidago gigantea\" (giant goldenrod), \"Sapium sebiferum\" (Chinese Tallow), and \"Lepidium draba\" (whitetop). Of these three model species, the success and behavior of \"Sapium sebifurum\" agreed most closely with the postulates of the EICA Hypothesis, according to the researches conducting the study. In its study, the success and behavior of \"Solidago gigantea\" was only partially explained by the EICA hypothesis, according to its researchers. \"Lepidium draba\" did not seem to follow any of the postulates of the EICA Hypothesis, as the researchers of the study understood them.\n\nThrough most of the studies done on the EICA Hypothesis (see examples above), it holds that the introduced populations of invasive plant species are less able to cope with the pressures of specialist herbivores than native populations of the same species are, suggesting that invasive species \"do\" respond to accelerated natural selection after being released from the selective pressure of specialist herbivores and \"do\" have the potential to reallocate resources away from specific forms of defense. However, not all of these introduced populations produce significantly more biomass than the native populations of the same species under laboratory conditions. A study conducted by Bossdorf et al. in 2004 on \"Alliaria petiolata\" (garlic mustard) may lend some insight into this discrepancy. Bossdorf et al. potted seeds from native and introduced populations of \"Alliaria petiolata\" and put them in direct competition with one another in a laboratory setting (i.e. the native and introduced populations were grown on in the same pot of soil, and subjected to the same treatments), and found that in direct competition, the native populations were able to out-compete the invasive populations. Bossdorf et al. proposed that this observation could result from the fact that there is a fitness cost to traits that increase so-called \"competitive ability\". Under this assumption, invasive populations of \"Alliaria petiolata\" had evolved a higher fitness (similar to \"Lythrum Salicaria\") in their introduced ranges at the cost of certain defense mechanisms \"and\" at the cost of certain aspects of growth and development (dissimilar to \"Lythrum Salicaria\"). It could be, therefore, that the EICA Hypothesis is too narrow in scope, and should be reworded to place an emphasis on an invasive species' ability to reallocate its resources in order to procure a fitness advantage that may or may not involve more vigorous growth and development.\n"}
{"id": "1686779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1686779", "title": "Fusion energy gain factor", "text": "Fusion energy gain factor\n\nThe fusion energy gain factor, usually expressed with the symbol Q, is the ratio of fusion power produced in a nuclear fusion reactor to the power required to maintain the plasma in steady state. The condition of \"Q\" = 1, when the power being released by the fusion reactions is equal to the required heating power, is referred to as breakeven.\n\nThe power given off by the fusion reactions may be captured within the fuel, leading to \"self-heating\". Most fusion reactions release at least some of their energy in a form that cannot be captured within the plasma, so a system at \"Q\" = 1 will cool without external heating. With typical fuels, self-heating in fusion reactors is not expected to match the external sources until at least \"Q\" = 5. If \"Q\" increases past this point, increasing self-heating eventually removes the need for external heating. At this point the reaction becomes self-sustaining, a condition called ignition. Ignition corresponds to infinite \"Q\", and is generally regarded as highly desirable for a practical reactor design.\n\nOver time, several related terms have entered the fusion lexicon. As a reactor does not cover its own heating losses until about \"Q\" = 5, the term engineering breakeven is sometimes used to describe a reactor that produces enough electricity to provide that heating. Above engineering breakeven a machine would produce more electricity than it uses, and could sell that excess. A machine that can sell enough electricity to cover its operating costs, estimated to require at least \"Q\" = 20, is sometimes known as economic breakeven.\n\n, the record for \"Q\" is held by the JET tokamak in the UK, at \"Q\" = (16 MW)/(24 MW) ≈ 0.67, first attained in 1997. ITER was originally designed to reach ignition, but is currently designed to reach \"Q\" = 10, producing 500 MW of fusion power from 50 MW of injected thermal power.\n\n\"Q\" is simply the comparison of the power being released by the fusion reactions in a reactor, \"P\", to the constant heating power being supplied, \"P\". However, there are several definitions of breakeven that consider additional power losses.\n\nIn 1955, John Lawson was the first to explore the energy balance mechanisms in detail, initially in classified works but published openly in a now-famous 1957 paper. In this paper he considered and refined work by earlier researchers, notably Hans Thirring, Peter Thonemann, and a review article by Richard Post. Expanding on all of these, Lawson's paper made detailed predictions for the amount of power that would be lost through various mechanisms, and compared that to the energy needed to sustain the reaction. This balance is today known as the Lawson criterion.\n\nIn a successful fusion reactor design, the fusion reactions generate an amount of power designated \"P\". Some amount of this energy, \"P\", is lost through a variety of mechanisms, mostly convection of the fuel to the walls of the reactor chamber and various forms of radiation that cannot be captured to generate power. In order to keep the reaction going, the system has to provide heating to make up for these losses, where \"P\" = \"P\" to maintain thermal equilibrium.\n\nThe most basic definition of breakeven is when \"Q\" = 1, that is, \"P\" = \"P\".\n\nSome works refer to this definition as scientific breakeven, to contrast it with similar terms. However, this usage is rare outside certain areas, specifically the inertial confinement fusion field, where the term is much more widely used.\n\nSince the 1950s, most commercial fusion reactor designs have been based on a mix of deuterium and tritium as their primary fuel; others fuels have been studied for a variety of reasons but are much harder to ignite. As tritium is radioactive, highly bioactive and highly mobile, it represents a significant safety concern and adds to the cost of designing and operating such a reactor.\n\nIn order to lower costs, many experimental machines are designed to run on test fuels of hydrogen or deuterium alone, leaving out the tritium. In this case, the term extrapolated breakeven is used to define the expected performance of the machine running on D-T fuel based on the performance when running on hydrogen or deuterium alone.\n\nThe records for extrapolated breakeven are slightly higher than the records for scientific breakeven. Both JET and JT-60 have reached values around 1.25 (see below for details) while running on D-D fuel. When running on D-T, only possible in JET, the maximum performance is about half the extrapolated value.\n\nAnother related term, engineering breakeven, considers the need to extract the energy from the reactor, turn that into electrical energy, and feed that back into the heating system. This closed loop is known as \"recirculation\". In this case, the basic definition changes by adding additional terms to the \"P\" side to consider the efficiencies of these processes.\n\nMost fusion reactions release energy in a variety of forms, mostly neutrons and a variety of charged particles like alpha particles. Neutrons are electrically neutral and will travel out of any magnetic confinement fusion (MFE) design, and in spite of the very high densities found in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) designs, they tend to easily escape the fuel mass in these designs as well. This means that only the charged particles from the reactions can be captured within the fuel mass and give rise to self-heating. If the fraction of the energy being released in the charged particles is \"f\", then the power in these particles is \"P\" = \"f\"\"P\". If this self-heating process is perfect, that is, all of \"P\" is captured in the fuel, that means the power available for generating electricity is the power that is not released in that form, or (1 − \"f\")\"P\".\n\nIn the case of neutrons carrying most of the practical energy, as is the case in the D-T fuel studied in most designs, this neutron energy is normally captured in a \"blanket\" of lithium that produces more tritium that is used to fuel the reactor. Due to various exothermic and endothermic reactions, the blanket may have a power gain factor a few percent higher or lower than 100%, but that will be neglected here. The blanket is then cooled and the cooling fluid used in a heat exchanger driving conventional steam turbines. These have an efficiency η which is around 35 to 40%.\n\nConsider a system that uses external heaters to heat the fusion fuel, then extracts the power from those reactions to generate electrical power. Some fraction of that power, \"f\", is needed to recirculate back into the heaters to close the loop. This is not the same as the \"P\" because the self-heating processes are providing some of the required energy. While the system as a whole requires additional power for building climate control, lighting, and the confinement system, these are generally much smaller than the plasma heating system requirements.\nConsidering all of these factors, the heating power can thus be related to the fusion power by the following equation:\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere formula_2 is the efficiency that power supplied to the heating systems is turned into heat in the fuel, as opposed to lost in the equipment itself, and formula_3 is the efficiency achieved when turning the heat into electrical power, for instance, through the Rankine cycle.\n\nThe fusion energy gain factor is then defined as:\n\nformula_4\n\nAs the temperature of the plasma increases, the rate of fusion reactions grows rapidly, and with it, the rate of self heating. In contrast, the non-capturable energy losses like x-rays do not grow at the same rate. Thus, in overall terms, the self-heating process becomes more efficient as the temperature increases, and less energy is needed from external sources to keep it hot.\n\nEventually \"P\" reaches zero, that is, all of the energy needed to keep the plasma at the operational temperature is being supplied by self-heating, and the amount of external energy that needs to be added drops to zero. This point is known as ignition.\n\nIgnition, by definition, corresponds to an infinite \"Q\", but it does not mean that \"f\" drops to zero as the other power sinks in the system, like the magnets and cooling systems, still need to be powered. Generally, however, these are much smaller than the energy in the heaters, and require a much smaller \"f\". More importantly, this number is more likely to be near constant, meaning that further improvements in plasma performance will result in more energy that can be directly used for commercial generation, as opposed to recirculation.\n\nThe final definition of breakeven is commercial breakeven, which occurs when the economic value of any net energy left over after recirculation is enough to finance the construction of the reactor. This value depends both on the reactor and the spot price of electrical power.\n\nCommercial breakeven relies on factors outside the technology of the reactor itself, and it is possible that even a reactor with a fully ignited plasma will not generate enough energy to pay for itself. Whether any of the mainline concepts like ITER can reach this goal is being debated in the field.\n\nMost fusion reactor designs being studied are based on the D-T reaction, as this is by far the easiest to ignite, and is energy dense. However, this reaction also gives off most of its energy in the form of a single highly energetic neutron, and only 20% of the energy in the form of an alpha. Thus, for the D-T reaction, \"f\" = 0.2. This means that self-heating does not become equal to the external heating until at least \"Q\" = 5. \n\nEfficiency values depend on design details but may be in the range of η = 0.7 (70%) and η = 0.4 (40%). The purpose of a fusion reactor is to produce power, not to recirculate it, so a practical reactor must have \"f\" = 0.2 approximately. Lower would be better but will be hard to achieve. Using these values we find for a practical reactor \"Q\" = 22.\n\nMany early fusion devices operated for microseconds, using some sort of pulsed power source to feed their magnetic confinement system and used the confinement as the heating source. Lawson defined breakeven in this context as the total energy released by the entire reaction cycle compared to the total energy supplied to the machine during the same cycle.\n\nOver time, as performance increased by orders of magnitude, the reaction times have extended from microseconds to seconds, and in ITER, on the order of minutes. In this case definition of \"the entire reaction cycle\" becomes blurred. In the case of an ignited plasma, for instance, P may be quite high while the system is being set up, and then drop to zero when it is fully developed, so one may be tempted to pick an instant in time when it is operating at its best to determine \"Q\". A better solution in these cases is to use the original Lawson definition averaged over the reaction to produce a similar value as the original definition.\n\nHowever, there is a complication. During the heating phase when the system is being brought up to operational conditions, some of the energy released by the fusion reactions will be used to heat the surrounding fuel, and thus not be released. This is no longer true when the plasma reaches its operational temperature and enters thermal equilibrium. Thus, if one averages over the entire cycle, this energy will be included as part of the heating term, that is, some of the energy that was captured for heating would otherwise have been released in P and is therefore not indicative of an operational \"Q\".\n\nOperators of the JET reactor argued that this input should be removed from the total:\n\nformula_5\n\nwhere:\n\nformula_6\n\nThat is, P is the amount of energy needed to raise the internal energy of the plasma. It is this definition that was used when reporting JET's record 0.67 value.\n\nSome debate over this definition continues. In 1998, the operators of the JT-60 claimed to have reached \"Q\" = 1.25 running on D-D fuel, thus reaching extrapolated breakeven. However, this measurement was based on the JET definition of Q*. Using this definition, JET had also reached extrapolated breakeven some time earlier. If one considers the energy balance in these conditions, and the analysis of previous machines, it is argued the original definition should be used, and thus both machines remain well below break-even of any sort.\n\nAlthough most fusion experiments use some form of magnetic confinement, another major branch is inertial confinement fusion (ICF) that mechanically presses together the fuel mass (the \"target\") to increase its density. This greatly increases the rate of fusion events and lowers the need to confine the fuel for long periods. This compression is accomplished by heating a lightweight capsule holding the fuel so rapidly that it explodes outwards, driving the fuel mass on the inside inward in accordance with Newton's third law. There are a variety of proposed \"drivers\" to cause the implosion process, but to date most experiments have used lasers. \n\nUsing the traditional definition of \"Q\", \"P\" / \"P\", ICF devices have extremely low \"Q\". This is because the laser is extremely inefficient; whereas formula_2 for the heaters used in magnetic systems might be on the order of 70%, lasers are on the order of 1.5%. For this reason, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), the leader in ICF research, has proposed another modification of \"Q\" that defines \"P\" as the energy delivered by the driver, as opposed to the energy put into the driver. This definition produces much higher \"Q\" values, and changes the definition of breakeven to be \"P\" / \"P\" = 1. On occasion, they referred to this definition as \"scientific breakeven\". This term was not universally used, other groups adopted the redefinition of \"Q\" but continued to refer to \"P\" = \"P\" simply as breakeven. \n\nOn 7 October 2013, the BBC announced that LLNL had achieved scientific breakeven in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) on 29 September. In this experiment, \"P\" was approximately 14 kJ, while the laser output was 1.8 MJ. By their previous definition, this would be a \"Q\" of 0.0077. However, for this press release, they re-defined \"Q\" once again, this time equating \"P\" to be only the amount energy delivered to \"the hottest portion of the fuel\", calculating that only 10 kJ of the original laser energy reached the part of the fuel that was undergoing fusion reactions. This release has been heavily criticized in the field.\n\n"}

{"id": "17273354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17273354", "title": "Geography and ecology of the Everglades", "text": "Geography and ecology of the Everglades\n\nThe geography and ecology of the Everglades involve the complex elements affecting the natural environment throughout the southern region of the U.S. state of Florida. Before drainage, the Everglades were an interwoven mesh of marshes and prairies covering . The Everglades is simultaneously a vast watershed that has historically extended from Lake Okeechobee south to Florida Bay (around one-third of the southern Florida peninsula), and many interconnected ecosystems within a geographic boundary. It is such a unique meeting of water, land, and climate that the use of either singular or plural to refer to the Everglades is appropriate. When Marjory Stoneman Douglas wrote her definitive description of the region in 1947, she used the metaphor \"River of Grass\" to explain the blending of water and plant life.\n\nAlthough sawgrass and sloughs are the enduring geographical icons of the Everglades, other ecosystems are just as vital, and the borders marking them are subtle or nonexistent. Pinelands and tropical hardwood hammocks are located throughout the sloughs; the trees, rooted in soil inches above the peat, marl, or water, support a variety of wildlife. The oldest and tallest trees are cypresses, whose roots are specially adapted to grow underwater for months at a time. The Big Cypress Swamp is well known for its 500-year-old cypresses, though cypress domes can appear throughout the Everglades. As the fresh water from Lake Okeechobee makes its way to Florida Bay, it meets salt water from the Gulf of Mexico; mangrove forests grow in this transitional zone, providing nursery and nesting conditions for many species of birds, fish, and invertebrates. The marine environment of Florida Bay is also considered part of the Everglades because its sea grasses and aquatic life are attracted to the constant discharge of fresh water.\n\nThese ecological systems are always changing due to environmental factors. Geographic features such as the Western Flatwoods, Eastern Flatwoods, and the Atlantic Coastal Ridge affect drainage patterns. Geologic elements, climate, and the frequency of storms and fire are formative processes for the Everglades. They help to sustain and transform the ecosystems in the Shark River Valley, Big Cypress Swamp, coastal areas and mangrove forests. Ecosystems have been described as both fragile and resilient. Minor fluctuations in water levels have far-reaching consequences for many plant and animal species, and the system cycles and pulses with each change.\n\nAt only 5,000 years of age, the Everglades is a young region in geological terms. Its ecosystems are in constant flux as a result of the interplay of three factors: the type and amount of water present, the geology of the region, and the frequency and severity of fires.\n\nWater is the dominant element in the Everglades, and it shapes the land, vegetation, and animal life of South Florida. The South Florida climate was once arid and semi-arid, interspersed with wet periods. Between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago, sea levels rose, submerging portions of the Florida peninsula and causing the water table to rise. Fresh water saturated the limestone, eroding some of it and creating springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and through evaporation formed thunderstorms. Limestone was dissolved by the slightly acidic rainwater. The limestone wore away, and groundwater came into contact with the surface, creating a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, the wearing away of the limestone in some areas created slight valleys and plateaus—a difference of inches in elevation—that affected not only the flow of water, but also types of vegetation present.\n\nThe Everglades are unique; no other wetland system in the world is nourished primarily from the atmosphere. Before the first attempt at draining the Everglades in 1882, the entire watershed extended from Orlando to Florida Bay comprising the Kissimmee–Lake Okeechobee–Everglades (KLOE) watershed. Kissimmee River outlets flow into Lake Okeechobee, which sits above sea level. Only two seasons exist in the Everglades: wet (May to November) and dry (December to April). Average annual rainfall in the Everglades is approximately , though fluctuations of precipitation are normal. Droughts, floods, and tropical storms are normal occurrences in the area. When Lake Okeechobee exceeds its water storage capacity during the wet season, it pours slowly over the southern rim and flows for to Florida Bay. The gradient change is so slight that the river moves only a minute. Sawgrass thrives in this river, dominates freshwater marshes and sloughs, and is the main characteristic of the region.\n\nSevere weather, in the form of tropical storms and hurricanes, also affects the structure of the Everglades. Between 1871 and 2003, 40 tropical cyclones struck the Everglades, usually every one to three years. These storms alter the coastline, flush decaying vegetation from estuaries, strip weakened branches from trees, and disperse seeds, pollen, and plant material. Hurricane Donna in 1960 affected of mangrove forests by depositing marl over the roots and depriving the trees of oxygen. It also eradicated orchids, bromeliads, and other epiphytes that once flourished in the mangroves; their reappearance may take a century or more. Donna also significantly spread buttonwood, saltwort, and glasswort, and epiphytes began to grow in new areas. Although the lasting effects remain to be seen, Hurricane Andrew in 1992 also destroyed mangrove forests and snapped slash pines in half. However, regrowth occurred quickly, and sand deposited by the storm surge improved nesting conditions for crocodiles and sea turtles.\n\nA vast marshland could only have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of the Everglades formed between 25 million and 2 million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a \"hydroperiod\", determines what particular soils and vegetation are present.\n\nShorter hydroperiods of three or four months promote the growth of periphyton: algae and other microscopic organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals. Periphyton is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster the growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod.\n\nFive types of peat appear in the Everglades system; each type supports a specific type of vegetation, such as sawgrass, tree islands, or custard apple trees. Peat buildup is possible because water prevents oxygen from quickly decomposing plant matter. Once peat buildup reaches the surface, oxygen reacts with the microorganisms to decay the peat rapidly in a process called subsidence. Initial attempts at developing agriculture near Lake Okeechobee were successful, but the nutrients in the peat quickly deteriorated by drying, and were broken down by bacteria in the soil. The dried peat burned or was degraded into carbon dioxide and water by microorganisms. Some homes built near early farms had to restructure their foundations on stilts as the peat deteriorated; other areas lost approximately of soil depth. Between the 1880s and 2005, an estimated 3.4 billion metric tons of soil has been lost in the Everglades due to oxidation. Most of that loss occurs in the Everglades Agricultural Area; the least amount of loss is found in Everglades National Park.\n\nFire is another important element in the maintenance of the Everglades. The majority are caused by lightning strikes from thunderstorms during the wet season. Their effects are largely superficial, and serve to foster further plant growth: sawgrass will burn above water, but the roots are preserved. Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees, and releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than decomposition. Large burned areas also affect waterflow, since wind and water are undeterred by the eradicated sawgrass; water may flow two to three times faster in recently burned areas. During the wet season only dead plant matter and the tips of plants are burned; however, the effects of fire are much more significant in the dry season, as fire may be fed by organic peat and burn deeply, destroying root systems. The only impediment to the spread of fire in the Everglades is the presence of water. It takes around 225 years for one foot (0.3 m) of peat to develop, but the peat is not as dense as it should be for the 5,000 years of the Everglades' existence. Scientists point to fire as the reason.\n\nResearchers have noted that fires appear in cycles associated with those of the hydroperiods. The first cycle is the annual wet-season fires that occur with rapid frequency during the summer, but are quickly extinguished. Dry-season fires are rarer due to the lack of lightning, but their damage may be more pervasive. A longer fire cycle spanning ten to fourteen years coincides with similar water cycles affected by global climate conditions. Fires in this cycle may be numerous and have little effect, or rare and have catastrophic consequences. The third cycle appears in a 550-year frequency associated with severe drought. Layers of charcoal have been detected inside peat in parts of the Everglades, indicating the region endured severe fires for years at a time, although this trend seems to have abated since the last occurrence around 940 BCE.\n\nThe Everglades are dominated by sawgrass in water; this is the titular \"River of Grass\" popularized by Marjory Stoneman Douglas in 1947. This river contains a wide variety of plant and animal life. An early American environmentalist named Gifford Pinchot said of the Everglades, \"It is a region so different that it hardly seems to belong to the United States. It is full of the most vivid and most interesting life on land, in the air, and in the water. It is a land of strangeness, separate and apart from the common things we all know so well.\"\n\nThe sawgrass grows in prairies or strands, in between channels of water in a shallow river long and wide flowing from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay. Some authors refer to the sawgrass and water combination as the \"true Everglades\" or just \"the Glades\". Prior to the first drainage attempts in 1905, the \"sheetflow\", or the wide shallow river starting in Lake Okeechobee, occupied nearly a third of the lower Florida peninsula. Though sawgrass remains the main feature of the Everglades, other ecosystems are scattered among the marshes and prairies, and their borders are sometimes imperceptible.\n\nMost marshes in the Everglades are dominated by the sedge known as \"Cladium\", or sawgrass in common terminology. The sedge is a three-dimensional v-shaped stalk with upward-pointing teeth. Sawgrass thrives in the slowly moving water, but may die if oxygen is unable to reach its roots and is particularly vulnerable to floods immediately after a fire. Some of the sawgrass can grow up to tall, and directly south of Lake Okeechobee it has grown to . Farther south, where the peat is not as rich, it typically grows tall in patches, as opposed to the prairies of the upper glades. The hydroperiod for the marsh is usually nine months but can last longer. In shorter hydroperiods, marl may form instead of peat.\n\nWhere sawgrass grows densely, few animals or other plants thrive, although alligators often choose these locations for nesting. Where there is more room, periphyton grows, appearing as mats or brown sausage-shaped chunks. Periphyton is predominantly algae, although over 100 different microorganisms help create it. Larval insects and amphibians are supported by periphyton; these in turn provide food for birds, fish, and reptiles. Periphyton also absorbs calcium from the water, which creates marl where sawgrass takes root.\n\nSloughs are channels of free-flowing water in between the sawgrass marshes. Sloughs are deeper than sawgrass marshes, about , and may stay flooded for at least 11 months out of the year if not multiple years in a row. The peat beds that support sawgrass are slightly elevated and may begin abruptly creating ridges of grass. The borders between these systems are called \"ridge-and-slough\" landscapes. Aquatic animals such as turtles, young alligators, snakes, and fish live in sloughs and they usually feed on aquatic invertebrates, such as the Florida apple snail. Plants grow here, usually submerged or floating like bladderwort (\"Utricularia\"), waterlily (\"Nymphaeaceae\"), or spatterdock (\"Nuphar lutea\"). Major sloughs in the Everglades system include the Shark River Slough draining to Florida Bay, Lostmans Slough bordering The Big Cypress, and Taylor Slough in the eastern Everglades.\n\nTwo kinds of wet prairies thrive in the Everglades: marl and water-marsh community. Wet prairies are slightly elevated like sawgrass marshes, but contain abundant plant diversity. Marl prairies are located where marl covers limestone that may protrude as pinnacles or erode into \"solution holes\": depressions formed by the same processes that create sinkholes. Solution holes, however, do not meet the water table; they are filled with rain water. The surface is covered only three to seven months of the year, but the water is usually just deep. Marl is created by layers of periphyton loosely attached to the limestone, and forms a grey or white crumbly mud when it dries. When flooded, the marl can support a variety of water plants, and dwarf cypresses may grow for hundreds of years though not exceed in height. Solution holes may remain flooded even when the prairies are dry, and they support aquatic invertebrates such as crayfish and snails, as well as larval amphibians which feed young wading birds. Where the predominant soil is peat, a water-marsh community exists. Its hydroperiod is longer than the marl prairie, although its plants are less diverse. These regions tend to be on the border between sloughs and sawgrass marshes.\n\nAlligators have created an ecological niche in wet prairies; they dig at low spots with their claws and snouts and create ponds free of vegetation that remain submerged throughout the dry season. Alligator holes are integral to the survival of aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, and birds during extended drought periods. Alligators feed upon animals that visit the hole.\n\nIslands of trees featuring dense temperate or tropical trees are called tropical hardwood hammocks. They may rise between above water level in freshwater sloughs, sawgrass prairies, or pineland. These islands illustrate the difficulty of characterizing the climate of the Everglades as tropical or subtropical. Hammocks in the northern portion of the Everglades consist of more temperate plant species, but closer to Florida Bay the trees are tropical and smaller shrubs are more prevalent. Tropical trees like the West Indian mahogany (\"Swietenia mahagoni\") were probably spread by birds carrying seeds from the West Indies.\n\nThese hammocks form on slightly elevated areas unharmed by deep peat fires or limestone plateaus rising several inches above the surrounding peat. Hardwood hammocks exhibit a mixture of subtropical and hardwood trees that grow in very dense clumps, such as southern live oak (\"Quercus virginiana\"), gumbo limbo (\"Bursera simaruba\"), royal palm (\"Roystonea\"), and willow bustic (\"Dipholis salicifolia\"). Near the bases of hammocks sharp saw palmettos (\"Serenoa repens\") flourish, making the hammocks very difficult to penetrate. Water in sloughs flow around the islands creating moats. Though some ecosystems are maintained and promoted by fire, hammocks may take decades or centuries to recover; the moats are therefore essential for protection. Islands vary in size, but most range between ; the water slowly flowing around them limits their size and gives them a teardrop appearance from above. The height of the trees is limited by factors such as frost, lightning, and wind: the majority of trees in hammocks grow no higher than .\n\nFlorida strangler figs (\"Ficus aurea\") are common in hammocks, and find particular ease in rooting at the heads of cabbage palms (\"Sabal palmetto\"). After taking root into the ground, they build complex frameworks around the host tree, eventually squeezing out light and nutrients, and essentially taking its place. A variety of invertebrates including beetles, ants, spiders, and tree snails support a food chain that includes frogs, owls and other birds of prey, snakes, rodents, bobcats, and raccoons. There are more than 50 varieties of tree snails in the Everglades; the color patterns and designs unique to single islands may be a result of the isolation of certain hammocks.\n\nTropical hardwood hammocks in the Everglades have been harvested for lumber, particularly by shipbuilders seeking West Indian mahogany and black ironwood (\"Krugiodendron ferreum\"). The largest and most mature of these trees had been removed by the late 18th century. Seminoles made their villages in hammocks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; they lived in groups of chickees numbering half a dozen, with one central chickee for cooking and another for eating. Dugout canoes, cookware, stills, and sewing machines may still be found in remote locations.\n\nSome hammocks are dominated by types of vegetation that grow in relation to the amount of water or type of soil present. The majority of hardwood hammocks create a thin poor soil covering the limestone called humus, made of decaying plant matter and moisture trapped by the structure of the trees. When peat forms the layer atop the limestone of a tree island, bayheads develop, dominated by bay trees such as sweetbay magnolia (\"Magnolia virginiana\") and others like swamp holly (\"Ilex decidua\"), wax myrtle (\"Myrica cerifera\"), and cocoplum (\"Chrysobalanus icaco\"). Willowheads, dominated by willow trees (\"Salix caroliniana\"), take hold where the hydroperiod is long, usually around solution or alligator holes, and may surround the holes, giving them a donut appearance from above.\n\nThe prairies and sloughs of the Everglades system are bordered by two areas of poorly drained sandy soil on both sides of Lake Okeechobee: the Eastern Flatwoods and the Western Flatwoods just north of Big Cypress Swamp. The predominant ecosystem in the Flatwoods is pine forest, but there are also cypress swamps and sloughs in the Eastern Flatwoods. Along the eastern border of the Everglades is the Atlantic Coastal Ridge, rising in elevation, and curving to the southwest, gradually decreasing in elevation until it meets Taylor Slough. The Coastal Ridge prevents Everglades water from flowing into the Atlantic Ocean to the east, directing it southwesterly into Florida Bay. The South Florida metropolitan area is located on a portion of the Atlantic Coastal Ridge, and much of the landscape has changed drastically within the past 100 years as a result of urban growth.\n\nPine rocklands (also called pinelands) are found on uneven limestone substrates that contain pinnacles and solution holes. There are three primary locations of pine rocklands: the Miami Ridge, which runs from Miami into Long Pine Key near the main entrance of Everglades National Park; the lower Florida Keys; and the Big Cypress Swamp. The most significant feature of the pine rockland ecosystem is the South Florida slash pine (\"Pinus elliotti\" var \"densa\"; also called Dade County pine) that reaches a height of . Pine rockland communities require fire for maintenance; they have adapted to promote and resist fire at the same time. These communities are located in the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod, although some floors may have flooded solution holes or puddles for a few months at a time. The sandy floor of the pine rocklands is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands include fire-resistant species like saw palmetto (\"Serenoa repens\"), cabbage palm (\"Sabal palmetto\"), and West Indian lilac (\"Tetrazygia bicolor\"). The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are herbs, of which two dozen species exist. These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms allowing for quick sprouts after charring.\n\nWildlife in pine rockland communities is diverse. In some forests, 15 species of birds can be found. Common among them are the pine warbler (\"Dendroica pinus\"), the red-bellied woodpecker (\"Melanerpes carolinus\"), and the eastern meadowlark (\"Sturnella magna\"). More than 20 species of reptiles and amphibians have been noted, such as the green anole (\"Anolis carolinensis\"), southern leopard frog (\"Rana sphenocephala\"), and southern black racer (\"Coluber constrictor priapus\"). Mammals such as the critically endangered Florida panther (\"Puma concolor coryi\"), American black bearFlorida black bear (\"Ursus americanus floridanus\"), and several types of bats also live in the pine rocklands.\n\nBefore urban development of the South Florida region, pine rocklands covered around in Miami-Dade County. Pine forests were extensively cleared by urban developers and the lumber industry in the 1930s and 1940s. Within Everglades National Park, of pine rockland communities are protected, but outside the park, of pine forests remain as of 1990, averaging in size. Dade County pine has a remarkable longevity and has proven to be termite-resistant, though dense enough to make driving nails difficult. In 1984 they were protected by a county ordinance, after many pine areas had been depleted. A misunderstanding of fire's role also played a part in the disappearance of pine forests, as natural fires were put out and pine rocklands transitioned into hardwood hammocks. Today prescribed fires occur in Everglades National Park in pine rocklands every three to seven years.\n\nWest of the sawgrass prairies and sloughs lies the Big Cypress Swamp, commonly called \"The Big Cypress\", referring to its size rather than the height or diameter of its trees. It takes up the majority of Collier County; at its most limited measurement, the swamp measures , but its hydrological boundary is nearly twice as large. The Big Cypress is slightly elevated at at its highest point and slopes gradually to the coastline for approximately . Because the defining feature of The Big Cypress is the abundance of trees it is considered a swamp, rather than a marsh where grass is the main characteristic.\n\nThe basin for The Big Cypress receives on average of water in the rainy season. Most of The Big Cypress sits atop a bedrock covered by a thin layer of limestone that contains quartz, creating a sandy soil that hosts a variety of vegetation. The majority of trees are bald cypress (\"Taxodium distichum\") and not true cypresses (\"Cupressaceae\"). Cypresses are conifers that are uniquely adapted to thrive in flooded conditions, with buttressed trunks and root projections that protrude out of the water, called \"knees\".\n\nCypress trees in the area can live for hundreds of years; some giants grow to and are 500 years old. Still, they may be only seventh- or eighth-generation cypresses. Few massive trees survived the logging operations that took place in the 1930s and 1940s. As a result, much of The Big Cypress is protected by various federal or state agencies that include Big Cypress National Preserve, Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve and two Indian reservations.\n\nAlthough The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \"heads\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (\"Acer rubrum\"), swamp bay (\"Persea palustris\"), and pop ash (\"Fraxinus caroliniana\"). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest.\n\nBecause the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (\"Mycteria americana\") nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the 1990s less than 2,000 were counted.\n\nWater from Lake Okeechobee and The Big Cypress eventually flows to the ocean. At a transitional zone where fresh water meets salt water, mangrove trees thrive, adapted as they are to both kinds of water. This brackish mixture of water and mangrove systems, crisscrossed by hundreds of tidal creeks, harbors a very productive ecosystem. The depth of these zones is dependent on how much water flows from the Everglades. In the wet season, fresh water pours into Florida Bay and sawgrass appears near the coastline. In dryer years, salt water creeps inland to the coastal prairie, an ecosystem that buffers the freshwater marshes by absorbing sea water. Mangrove trees grow in fresh water ecosystems when the salt water flows far enough inland. The Everglades have the most extensive contiguous system of mangroves in the world. The mangrove forests of the Ten Thousand Islands cover almost .\n\nThree species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (\"Rhizophora mangle\"), black (\"Avicennia germinans\"), and white (\"Laguncularia racemosa\"), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges.\n\nThe estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (\"Limulus polyphemus\"). The region supports a $59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (\"Farfantepenaeus duorarum\") industry, and a $22 million-a-year stone crab (\"Menippe mercenaria\") industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.\n\nMangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (\"Platalea ajaja\"), egrets, and tricolored herons (\"Egretta tricolor\") use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources and the protection offered from most prey. Thousands of birds can nest in the mangroves at once, making a noisy and messy colony, but their droppings fertilize the mangrove trees. Shorebirds like rails, terns and gulls; diving birds such as pelicans and grebes; and birds of prey such as ospreys, hawks and vultures are among the more than 100 species of birds that use Everglades mangrove trees to raise their young.\n\nBecause much of the coast and inner estuaries are built by mangroves—and there is no border between the coastal marshes and the bay—the ecosystems in Florida Bay are considered part of the Everglades. More than of Florida Bay is protected by Everglades National Park, representing the largest body of water in the park boundaries. There are approximately one hundred keys in Florida Bay, many of which are mangrove forests. Larger islands may be taken over by hardwood hammocks. The outer rims of the Ten Thousand Islands and Cape Sable share characteristics of the intertwining saltwater bays and fresh water marshes.\n\nThe fresh water entering Florida Bay from the Everglades creates ideal conditions for vast beds of turtle grass and algae formations that foster animal life in the bay. Sea turtles and manatees (\"Trichechus manatus latirostris\") eat the grass, while invertebrates such as worms, clams, and other mollusks consume algae formations and microscopic plankton. Female sea turtles return annually to nest on the shore, and manatees spend the winter months in the warmer water of the bay. The Calusa Indians had various uses for shells of marine invertebrates, due to the lack of dense rock with which to make tools. They used the horse conch (\"Triplofusus papillosus\"), left-handed whelk (\"Sinistrofulgur\"), and the Florida crown conch (\"Melongena corona\") as drinking vessels, picks, hammers, knives and awls.\n\nSea grasses stabilize sea beds and protect shorelines from erosion by absorbing energy from waves. Shrimp, spiny lobsters, and sea urchins live in and among the grasses and feed on phytoplankton; they in turn feed larger predators such as sharks, rays, barracuda, and king mackerel (\"Scomberomorus cavalla\"). Due to shallow water and abundant sunlight, Florida Bay hosts communities of coral reefs and sponges, although the majority of the state's reefs are closer to the Florida Keys. Everglades keys that foster mangroves also support nurseries for wading birds such as the Great blue heron (\"Ardea herodias\"), which was almost wiped out in the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 (only 146 were counted afterward). After recovering to number more than 2,000, they were further endangered by Hurricane Donna in 1960, which decreased their numbers by 35 to 40 percent.\n\nSea floor patterns of Florida Bay are formed by currents and winds. However, since 1932, sea levels have been rising at a rate of per 100 years. Though mangroves serve to build and stabilize the coastline, seas may be rising more rapidly than the trees are able to build.\n\nEcosystems in the Everglades have been described as both fragile and resilient. Author Michael Grunwald wrote about the observations of the Everglades' first American visitors: \"If the Grand Canyon was a breathtaking painting, the Everglades was a complex drama, and everything in it had a role.\" An estimated 11,000 species of seed-bearing plants and 400 species of land or water vertebrates live in the Everglades, but slight variations in water levels affect many organisms and reshape land formations. The health and productivity of any ecosystem relies on the number of species present: the loss of one species weakens the entire ecosystem.\n\nFor example, Florida apple snails (\"Pomacea paludosa\") are an amphibious fresh water mollusk. They have a single gill and lung, and live on stalks of sawgrass in water depths no more than . They are the primary food of the endangered snail kite (\"Rostrhamus sociabilis\") and limpkin (\"Aramus guarauna\") as well as the raccoon, otter, and young alligator. Apple snails lay their eggs on sawgrass stalks about above the water line, and they are intolerant of being submerged for long periods of time. When the eggs hatch, young snails must enter the water quickly or face death. When water levels are too low or rise too quickly while snail eggs are developing, apple snails do not flourish, affecting the many reptiles, mammals, and birds that feed on them. With regard to the ecology of trophic dynamics, or food chains, the 174 species of invertebrates play a vital role in the Everglades. Crayfish, insects, scorpions, and other invertebrates also support a web of animals.\n\nThe group of animals most integral to the overall success of Everglades wildlife is freshwater fish. Few places in the Everglades stay submerged from one year to the next, so alligator holes and deep clefts in the limestone are vital to the survival of fish, and the animal community as a whole. Freshwater fish are the main diet of most wading birds, alligators, and otters, and require large areas of open water in order to repopulate. Young amphibians also play an important role in the food chain. Tadpoles spread quickly in isolated areas where fish do not have the time or access to reproduce in numbers necessary to support larger animals. Hundreds of species of amphibians are found in the Everglades, and their availability helps support wildlife during short hydroperiods or in remote locations.\n\nThese smaller animals support communities of larger animals, including 70 species of land birds that breed within the Everglades, and 120 water birds, of which 43 breed in the area. Many of these birds go on to migrate through the West Indies and North America. Several dozen species of mammals also thrive in the region, from tiny bats and shrews to midsize raccoons (\"Procyon lotor\"), otters (\"Lontra canadensis\"), opossums (\"Didelphis virginiana\"), and foxes. The largest include white tailed deer (\"Odocoileus virginianus\"), the Florida black bear, and the Florida panther.\n\nAlthough slight changes in water level affect many species, the system as a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the diversity of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well in wet conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (\"Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis\") do well in dryer circumstances.\n\nPeople have lived in the Everglades region for thousands of years. Within the past 100 years however, they have changed the natural landscape dramatically. Settlement of urban areas in South Florida was facilitated by large drainage projects intended to create more land. The drainage was often implemented without a full understanding of the intricacies of ecosystems and shaping processes of the Everglades. The South Florida metropolitan area grew exponentially, causing problems in ecosystems throughout the Everglades. By the 1990s, the diminishing quality of life in many of these urban areas was linked to the degraded local environment. The State of Florida and the U.S. government devised and passed a plan in 2000 to restore as much of the Everglades to pre-drainage conditions as possible. It is the costliest and most comprehensive environmental restoration project in history.\n\nHumans have also adversely impacted the ecology of the Everglades by introducing numerous invasive species, which may prey on or compete with native species. A spectacular and particularly damaging example of this phenomenon is the recent proliferation of the Burmese python in the Everglades, as well as elsewhere in Florida. First observed in the wild in 1979 and not again until 1995, they have increased alarmingly since 2000. By 2011, decreases of 87.5%, 94.1%, 98.9% and 99.3% in sightings of bobcats, white-tailed deer, opossums and raccoons, respectively, were reported in park road surveys, while rabbits were no longer being seen at all.\n\n"}

The Gulf Stream, which is produced by the earth’s rotation, contains an enormous amount hydrokinetic energy. To tap into this immense source of renewable energy to produce electricity Gulf Stream Turbines plan on creating submersible power plants that can operate for extremely long periods without servicing. The Gulf Stream Turbine can do this because of its failure-proof design that depends on the laws of physics and has few moving parts.\n\nThe Gulf Stream Turbine relies on the relative locations of its centers of buoyancy and gravity to obtain its great stability and on a unique method of leveraging opposing forces to balance the lifting forces produced by the hydrofoils against the downward vector forces produced by the horizontal drag acting through the downward-angled anchor line. Because of their simplicity and lack of moving parts, they can generate electricity for extremely long periods without servicing.\n\nThe patents cover a self-supporting structure that allows the turbines to be positioned at those depths where the current can generate electricity at near the turbines’ design capacities. The actual conversion of the water’s kinetic energy into electricity utilizes the same technologies that are used by the wind-turbine industry. Unlike the wind turbines, the Gulf Stream Turbines will have very high capacity factors, extremely low O&M costs, and be able to produce usable power 24-7.\n\nEvery kilowatt-hour of electricity generated with renewable energy can replace the same amount of electricity that is generated with a fossil fuel. If the electricity generated with a 1.2-MW Gulf Stream Turbine were to replace that generated by a coal-fired plant, the CO2 emissions would be cut by about 13,000 tons. If that electricity replaced that generated by a gas-fired turbine, those emissions would be reduced by about 5,900 tons.\n\nDuring off-peak periods, the electricity produced by the Gulf Stream Turbines can replace the fossil-fuel-produced electricity, produce hydrogen for fuel-cell-powered cars, and recharge the batteries of plug-in hybrids and electric cars – all of which would further reduce the CO2 emissions. \nIt is impossible to predict the additional incomes that might result from the sale of the carbon permits because the prices of those permits will be determined by auction and the supply will be controlled by those government officials administering the program.\n\nA number of economists have estimated that the carbon prices will probably range between $20 and $40 per ton. With a carbon offset commodity futures price of $30 a ton, the owners of a 1.2-MW Gulf Stream Turbine could potentially receive an additional income of $390,000 per year – based on the 13,000 tons of CO2 that would be emitted by coal-fired plants producing that same amount of electricity.\n\nWith a wholesale electricity price of 10 cents per kWh, the revenues from the sale of the electricity and the PTC subsidy would be $1,081,897. Adding the $390,000 from the sale of the carbon permits would increase it to $1,471,897. That $1,471,897 would produce a return of 61.3% on an investment of $2.4 million ($2,000/kW) and of 49% on an investment of $3 million ($2,500/kW)\n\n"}

For example, in Hesiod's \"Works and Days\", the fair-haired \"Horai\", together with the Charites and Peitho crown Pandora—she of \"all gifts\"—with garlands of flowers. Similarly Aphrodite, emerging from the sea and coming ashore at Cyprus, is dressed and adorned by the \"Horai\", and, according to a surviving fragment of the epic \"Cypria\", Aphrodite wore clothing made for her by the Charites and Horai, dyed with spring flowers, such as the \"Horai\" themselves wear.\n\nThe number of Horae varied according to different sources, but was most commonly three: either the trio of Thallo, Auxo and Carpo (goddesses of the order of nature) or Eunomia (goddess of good order and lawful conduct) and her sisters Dike (goddess of Justice) and Eirene (goddess of Peace).\n\nIn Argos, two Horae, rather than three, were recognised presumably winter and summer: Auxesia (possibly another name for Auxo) and Damia (possibly another name for Carpo).\n\nIn late euhemerist interpretations, they were seen as Cretan maidens who were worshipped as goddesses after they had been wrongfully stoned to death.\n\nThe earliest written mention of \"Horai\" is in the \"Iliad\" where they appear as keepers of Zeus's cloud gates. \"Hardly any traces of that function are found in the subsequent tradition,\" Karl Galinsky remarked in passing. They were daughters of Zeus and Themis, half-sisters to the Moirai.\n\nThe Horai are mentioned in two aspects in Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns:\n\nOf the first, more familiar, triad associated with Aphrodite and Zeus is their origins as emblems of times of life, growth (and the classical three seasons of year):\n\n\nAt Athens, two Horae; Thallo (the Hora of spring) and Carpo (the Hora of autumn), also appear in rites of Attica noted by Pausanias in the 2nd century AD. Thallo, Auxo and Carpo are often accompanied by Chione, a daughter of Boreas (the god/personification of the North Wind) and Orithyia/Oreithyia (originally a mortal princess, who was later deifyied as a goddess of cold mountain winds), and the goddess/personification of snow and winter. Along with Chione, Thallo, Auxo and Carpo were a part of the entourage of the goddess of the turn of the seasons, Persephone.\n\nOf the second triad associated to Themis and Zeus for law and order:\n\nHyginus (\"Fabulae\" 183) identifies a third set of Horae:\n\nNonnus in his \"Dionysiaca\" mentions a distinct set of four Horae, the daughters of Helios. Quintus Smyrnaeus also attributes the Horae as the daughters of Helios and Selene, and describes them as the four handmaidens of Hera. The Greek words for the four seasons of year:\n\nFinally, a quite separate suite of Horae personified the twelve hours (originally only ten), as tutelary goddesses of the times of day. The hours run from just before sunrise to just after sunset, thus winter hours are short, summer hours are long:\n\nAccording to Hyginus, the list is only of nine, borrowed from the three classical triads alternated:\n\nThis last distinct set of ten or twelve Hours is much less known:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5620279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5620279", "title": "Hydrological transport model", "text": "Hydrological transport model\n\nAn hydrological transport model is a mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters. These models generally came into use in the 1960s and 1970s when demand for numerical forecasting of water quality was driven by environmental legislation, and at a similar time widespread access to significant computer power became available. Much of the original model development took place in the United States and United Kingdom, but today these models are refined and used worldwide.\n\nThere are dozens of different transport models that can be generally grouped by pollutants addressed, complexity of pollutant sources, whether the model is steady state or dynamic, and time period modeled. Another important designation is whether the model is distributed (i.e. capable of predicting multiple points within a river) or lumped. In a basic model, for example, only one pollutant might be addressed from a simple point discharge into the receiving waters. In the most complex of models, various line source inputs from surface runoff might be added to multiple point sources, treating a variety of chemicals plus sediment in a dynamic environment including vertical river stratification and interactions of pollutants with in-stream biota. In addition watershed groundwater may also be included. The model is termed \"physically based\" if its parameters can be measured in the field.\n\nOften models have separate modules to address individual steps in the simulation process. The most common module is a subroutine for calculation of surface runoff, allowing variation in land use type, topography, soil type, vegetative cover, precipitation and land management practice (such as the application rate of a fertilizer). The concept of hydrological modeling can be extended to other environments such as the oceans, but most commonly (and in this article) the subject of a river watershed is generally implied.\n\nIn 1850, T. J. Mulvany was probably the first investigator to use mathematical modeling in a stream hydrology context, although there was no chemistry involved. By 1892 M.E. Imbeau had conceived an event model to relate runoff to peak rainfall, again still with no chemistry. Robert E. Horton’s seminal work on surface runoff along with his coupling of quantitative treatment of erosion laid the groundwork for modern chemical transport hydrology.\n\nPhysically based models (sometimes known as deterministic, comprehensive or process-based models) try to represent the physical processes observed in the real world. Typically, such models contain representations of surface runoff, subsurface flow, evapotranspiration, and channel flow, but they can be far more complicated. \"Large scale simulation experiments were begun by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1953 for reservoir management on the main stem of the Missouri River\". This, and other early work that dealt with the River Nile and the Columbia River are discussed, in a wider context, in a book published by the Harvard Water Resources Seminar, that contains the sentence just quoted.\nAnother early model that integrated many submodels for basin chemical hydrology was the Stanford Watershed Model (SWM). The SWMM (Storm Water Management Model), the HSPF (Hydrological Simulation Program - FORTRAN) and other modern American derivatives are successors to this early work.\n\nIn Europe a favoured comprehensive model is the Système Hydrologique Européen (SHE), which has been succeeded by MIKE SHE and SHETRAN. MIKE SHE is a watershed-scale physically based, spatially distributed model for water flow and sediment transport. Flow and transport processes are represented by either finite difference representations of partial differential equations or by derived empirical equations. The following principal submodels are involved:\n\nThis model can analyze effects of land use and climate changes upon in-stream water quality, with consideration of groundwater interactions.\n\nWorldwide a number of basin models have been developed, among them RORB (Australia), Xinanjiang (China), Tank model (Japan), ARNO (Italy), TOPMODEL (Europe), UBC (Canada) and HBV (Scandinavia), MOHID Land (Portugal). However, not all of these models have a chemistry component. Generally speaking, SWM, SHE and TOPMODEL have the most comprehensive stream chemistry treatment and have evolved to accommodate the latest data sources including remote sensing and geographic information system data.\n\nIn the United States, the Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center in conjunction with a researchers at a number of universities have developed the Gridded Surface/Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis GSSHA model. GSSHA is widely used in the U.S. for research and analysis by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers districts and larger consulting companies to compute flow, water levels, distributed erosion, and sediment delivery in complex engineering designs. A distributed nutrient and contaminant fate and transport component is undergoing testing. GSSHA input/output processing and interface with GIS is facilitated by the Watershed Modeling System (WMS).\n\nAnother model used in the United States and worldwide is V\"flo\", a physics-based distributed hydrologic model developed by Vieux & Associates, Inc. V\"flo\" employs radar rainfall and GIS data to compute spatially distributed overland flow and channel flow. Evapotranspiration, inundation, infiltration, and snowmelt modeling capabilities are included. Applications include civil infrastructure operations and maintenance, stormwater prediction and emergency management, soil moisture monitoring, land use planning, water quality monitoring, and others.\n\nThese models based on data are black box systems, using mathematical and statistical concepts to link a certain input (for instance rainfall) to the model output (for instance runoff). Commonly used techniques are regression, transfer functions, neural networks and system identification. These models are known as stochastic hydrology models. Data based models have been used within hydrology to simulate the rainfall-runoff relationship, represent the impacts of antecedent moisture and perform real-time control on systems.\n\nA key component of a hydrological transport model is the surface runoff element, which allows assessment of sediment, fertilizer, pesticide and other chemical contaminants. Building on the work of Horton, the unit hydrograph theory was developed by Dooge in 1959. It required the presence of the National Environmental Policy Act and kindred other national legislation to provide the impetus to integrate water chemistry to hydrology model protocols. In the early 1970s the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began sponsoring a series of water quality models in response to the Clean Water Act. An example of these efforts was developed at the Southeast Water Laboratory, one of the first attempts to calibrate a surface runoff model with field data for a variety of chemical contaminants.\n\nThe attention given to surface runoff contaminant models has not matched the emphasis on pure hydrology models, in spite of their role in the generation of stream loading contaminant data. In the United States the EPA has had difficulty interpreting diverse proprietary contaminant models and has to develop its own models more often than conventional resource agencies, who, focused on flood forecasting, have had more of a centroid of common basin models.\n\nLiden applied the HBV model to estimate the riverine transport of three different substances, nitrogen, phosphorus and suspended sediment in four different countries: Sweden, Estonia, Bolivia and Zimbabwe. The relation between internal hydrological model variables and nutrient transport was assessed. A model for nitrogen sources was developed and analysed in comparison with a statistical method. A model for suspended sediment transport in tropical and semi-arid regions was developed and tested. It was shown that riverine total nitrogen could be well simulated in the Nordic climate and riverine suspended sediment load could be estimated fairly well in tropical and semi-arid climates. The HBV model for material transport generally estimated material transport loads well. The main conclusion of the study was that the HBV model can be used to predict material transport on the scale of the drainage basin during stationary conditions, but cannot be easily generalised to areas not specifically calibrated. In a different work, Castanedo et al. applied an evolutionary algorithm to automated watershed model calibration.\n\nThe United States EPA developed the DSSAM Model to analyze water quality impacts from land use and wastewater management decisions in the Truckee River basin, an area which include the cities of Reno and Sparks, Nevada as well as the Lake Tahoe basin. The model satisfactorily predicted nutrient, sediment and dissolved oxygen parameters in the river. It is based on a pollutant loading metric called \"Total Daily Maximum Load\" (TDML). The success of this model contributed to the EPA’s commitment to the use of the underlying TDML protocol in EPA’s national policy for management of many river systems in the United States.\n\nThe DSSAM Model is constructed to allow dynamic decay of most pollutants; for example, total nitrogen and phosphorus are allowed to be consumed by benthic algae in each time step, and the algal communities are given a separate population dynamic in each river reach (e.g. based upon river temperature). Regarding stormwater runoff in Washoe County, the specific elements within a new xeriscape ordinance were analyzed for efficacy using the model. For the varied agricultural uses in the watershed, the model was run to understand the principal sources of impact, and management practices were developed to reduce in-river pollution. Use of the model has specifically been conducted to analyze survival of two endangered species found in the Truckee River and Pyramid Lake: the Cui-ui sucker fish (endangered 1967) and the Lahontan cutthroat trout (threatened 1970).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12878756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12878756", "title": "Lake island", "text": "Lake island\n\nA lake island is any landmass within a lake. It is a type of inland island. Lake islands may form a lake archipelago.\n\nLake islands may form in numerous ways. They may occur through a build-up of sedimentation as shoals, and become true islands through changes in the level of the lake. They may have been originally part of the lake's shore, and been separated from it by erosion, or they may have been left as pinnacles when the lake formed through a raising in the level of a river or other waterway (either naturally, or artificially through the damming of a river or lake). They may also have formed through earthquake, meteor, or volcanic activity. In the latter case, crater or caldera islands exist, with new volcanic prominences in lakes formed in the craters of larger volcanoes. Other lake islands include ephemeral beds of floating vegetation, and islands artificially formed by human activity.\n\nLakes may sometimes form in the circular depressions of volcanic craters. These craters are typically circular or oval basins around the vent or vents from which magma erupts. \nA large volcanic eruption sometimes results in the formation of a caldera, caused by the collapse of the magma chamber under the volcano. If enough magma is ejected, the emptied chamber is unable to support the weight of the volcano, and a roughly circular fracture, the ring fault, develops around the edge of the chamber. The centre of the volcano within the ring fracture collapses, creating a ring-shaped depression. Long after the eruption, this caldera may fill with water to become a lake. If volcanic activity continues or restarts, the centre of the caldera may be uplifted in the form of a resurgent dome, to become a crater lake island. Though typically calderas are larger and deeper than craters and form in different ways, a distinction between the two is often ignored in non-technical circumstances and the term crater lake is widely used for the lakes formed in both craters and calderas. The following is a list of large or notable crater lake islands:\n\n\nImpact craters, formed by the collision of large meteorites or comets with the Earth, are relatively uncommon, and those which do exist are frequently heavily eroded or deeply buried. Several, however, do contain lakes. Where the impact crater is complex, a central peak emerges from the floor of the crater. If a lake is present, this central peak may break the water's surface as an island. In other cases, other geological processes may have caused only a ring-shaped annular lake to remain from an impact, with a large central island taking up the remaining area of the crater. The world's largest impact crater island (and the world's second-largest lake island of any kind) is René-Levasseur Island, in Lake Manicouagan, Canada. The Sanshan Islands of Lake Tai, China, are also examples of impact crater islands, as are the islands in Canada's Clearwater Lakes, and the Slate Islands of Lake Superior, also in Canada. Sollerön Island in Siljan Lake, Sweden, and an unnamed island in Lake Karakul, Tajikistan, was also formed by meteor impact.\n\nThe term floating island is sometimes used for accumulations of vegetation free-floating within a body of water. Due to the lack of currents and tides, these are more frequently found in lakes than in rivers or the open sea. Peaty masses of vegetable matter from shallow lake floors may rise due to the accumulation of gases during decomposition, and will often float for a considerable time, becoming ephemeral islands until the gas has dissipated enough for the vegetation to return to the lake floor.\n\nArtificial or man-made islands are islands constructed by human activity rather than formed by natural means. They may be totally created by humans, enlarged from existing islands or reefs, formed by joining small existing islands, or cut from a mainland (for example, by cutting through the isthmus of a peninsula). Artificial islands have a long history, dating back to the crannogs of prehistoric Britain and Ireland, and the traditional floating Uru islands of Lake Titicaca in South America. Notable early artificial islands include the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, at the site of modern Mexico City. Though technically caused by human activity, islands formed from hilltops by the deliberate flooding of valleys (such as in the creation of hydroelectricity projects and reservoirs) are not normally regarded as artificial islands.\n\nArtificial islands are built for numerous uses, ranging from flood protection to immigration or quarantine stations. Other uses for reclaimed artificial islands include expansion of living space or transportation centres in densely populated regions. Agricultural land has also been developed through reclamation of polders in the Netherlands and other low lying countries.\n\nNotable modern examples of artificial lake islands include the Dutch polder of Flevopolder in Flevoland, the island of IJburg in Amsterdam, and Flamingo Island in Kamfers Dam, South Africa. At , Flevopolder, in the now-freshwater lake IJsselmeer, is the largest man-made island in the world.\n\nNote: Samosir in Lake Toba, Indonesia – , was originally formed as a peninsula; its current island status, however, is only through its deliberate separation from the mainland by a canal. For this reason, it is not included in the above list.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Tropical cyclones that attain such winds and move over land while maintaining those winds are capable of causing severe damage to human lives and infrastructure. From 1949 to 2018, a total of 82 recorded Pacific hurricanes have peaked at Category 3 strength within the Northeast Pacific tropical cyclone basin, which is denoted as the part of the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line. This does not include storms that also attained Category 4 or 5 status on the scale.\n\nThe development of Category 3 hurricanes in the Northeast Pacific basin is influenced by many factors. During the Northern Hemisphere winter and spring months of December to April, sea surface temperatures in the tropics are usually too low to support tropical cyclogenesis. Furthermore, from January to April, the North Pacific High and Aleutian Low induce strong vertical wind shear and unfavorable conditions that serve to prevent the development of hurricanes. These effects are reduced or even disappear during hurricane season from May to November, when sea surface temperatures are also high enough to support tropical cyclogenesis; the bulk of recorded Category 3 hurricanes developed during June to October. Global weather patterns may also influence hurricane development in the Northeast Pacific. El Niño events result in increased numbers of powerful hurricanes through weaker wind shear and higher sea surface temperatures within the basin, while La Niña events reduce the number of such hurricanes through the opposite.\n\nOn the Saffir–Simpson scale, a hurricane reaches Category 3 status when it attains maximum sustained winds of between and . The National Hurricane Center (NHC) takes sustained winds to be the average wind speed measured over the period of one minute at the height of above the ground. When a hurricane reaches Category 3 intensity, it is termed a \"major hurricane\" by the NHC, though this term is also used to describe hurricanes at Category 4 or 5 intensity. Should a Category 3 hurricane make landfall, its strongest winds can cause very severe damage to human infrastructure, with debris carried by the winds capable of bringing injury or death to humans and animals.\n\nThe Northeast Pacific tropical cyclone basin is defined as the region of the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and east of the International Date Line. The Northeast Pacific is further divided into two sub-basins, namely the east and central Pacific. The east Pacific runs east of the 140th meridian west, and tropical cyclones occurring there are warned upon by the National Hurricane Center, the current Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) for that area. The central Pacific, running from the 140th meridian west to the International Date Line, currently has the Central Pacific Hurricane Center as its RSMC. Tropical cyclones are generally much rarer in the central Pacific than in the east Pacific, with an average of just four to five storms forming or moving into the central Pacific compared to around 15 for the east Pacific. All tropical cyclones recorded by past and present RSMCs of the Northeast Pacific basin since 1949 are listed in the Northeast and North Central Pacific hurricane database (HURDAT), which is compiled and maintained by the National Hurricane Center.\n\nBefore 1970, tropical cyclones within the Northeast Pacific were classified into three categories: tropical depression, tropical storm, and hurricane; these were assigned intensities of 30 mph (45 km/h), 50 mph (85 km/h), and 85 mph (140 km/h) respectively. Exceptions to these rules would be storms that affected humans and as such humans were able to measure or estimate wind speeds or pressure data. Due to this lack of specific intensity records, there has been only one confirmed Category 3 hurricane prior to 1970.\n\nHurricane season in the Northeast Pacific tropical cyclone basin begins on May 15 in the east Pacific and June 1 in the central Pacific, and ends on November 30. Since 1949, a total of 82 Category 3 hurricanes have developed in the Northeast Pacific basin. Only one has occurred in the off-season: Hurricane Ekeka of 1992, which peaked in February. Only one Category 3 hurricane has reached that intensity in May. A total of 7 have done so in June, 20 in July, 24 in August, 14 in September, and another 15 in October. None have done so in November.\n\nThe formation and development of tropical cyclones, termed tropical cyclogenesis, requires high sea surface temperatures of at least and low vertical wind shear. When these conditions are met, a pre-existing tropical disturbance – usually a tropical wave – can develop into a tropical cyclone, provided the disturbance is far enough from the Equator to experience a sufficiently strong Coriolis force which is responsible for the counterclockwise rotation of hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere. During the winter and spring months of December to April, sea surface temperatures in the tropics are usually too low to support development. Also, the presence of a semi-permanent high-pressure area known as the North Pacific High in the eastern Pacific greatly suppresses formation of tropical cyclones in the winter, as the North Pacific High results in vertical wind shear that causes environmental conditions to be unconducive to tropical cyclone formation. Another factor preventing tropical cyclones from forming during the winter is the presence of a semi-permanent low-pressure area called the Aleutian Low between January and April. Its effects in the central Pacific near the 160th meridian west cause tropical waves that form in the area to drift northward into the Gulf of Alaska and dissipate or become extratropical. Its retreat in late-April allows the warmth of the Pacific High to meander in, bringing its powerful clockwise wind circulation with it. The Intertropical Convergence Zone departs southward in mid-May permitting the formation of the earliest tropical waves, coinciding with the start of the eastern Pacific hurricane season on May 15. During summer and autumn, sea surface temperatures rise further to reach near in July and August, well above the threshold for tropical cyclogenesis. This allows for hurricanes developing during that time to strengthen significantly.\n\nThe El Niño-Southern Oscillation also influences the frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the Northeast Pacific basin. During years with the existence of an El Niño event, sea surface temperatures increase in the Northeast Pacific and average vertical wind shear decreases, resulting in an increase in activity; the opposite happens in the Atlantic basin during El Niño, where increased wind shear creates an unfavorable environment for tropical cyclone formation. Contrary to El Niño, La Niña increases wind shear and decreases sea surface temperatures over the eastern Pacific, while reducing wind shear and increasing sea surface temperatures over the Atlantic.\n\nWithin the Northeast Pacific, tropical cyclones generally head west out into the open Pacific Ocean, steered by the westward trade winds. Closer to the end of the season, however, some storms are steered northwards or northeastwards around the subtropical ridge nearer the end of the season, and may bring impacts to the western coasts of Mexico and occasionally even Central America. In the central Pacific basin, the North Pacific High keeps tropical cyclones away from the Hawaiian Islands by forcing them southwards. Combined with cooler waters around the Hawaiian Islands that tend to weaken approaching tropical cyclones, this makes direct impacts on the Hawaiian Islands by tropical cyclones rare.\n\n\nOf the 82 Category 3 hurricanes in the east and central Pacific, a total of 14 made landfall while still a tropical cyclone, collectively resulting in 18 landfalls. As tropical cyclones approach land, they tend to weaken due to land interaction, cooler waters, shallower waters due to shelving, increased vertical wind shear, or dry air. As such, only four of these 14 hurricanes have made landfall while still at Category 3 intensity: Olivia of 1967, Olivia of 1975, Kiko of 1989, and Lane of 2006. Only three made more than one landfall during their lifespan: Hilary of 1993, which made three landfalls, as well as Olivia of 1967 and Fausto of 1996, which made two landfalls each. Only two years – 1971 and 1984 – saw more than one Category 3 hurricane make landfall, though in neither year any of those Category 3 hurricanes made landfall as hurricanes. In the following table, dates where storms made landfall are listed next to the locations where the storms made landfall.\n\n"}

It covers alien races and other fictional creatures, but not specific characters. Individual characters are listed in separate articles.\n\nNote that some information on the page is taken from spin-off media.\n\nThe Quill were a humanoid species from the planet Rhodia who had a long history of war with the other species on Rhodia, the Rhodians. All the Rhodians and the Quill were killed by the Shadow Kin, except the Prince of Rhodia and Andra'ath, the Quill freedom fighter who was indentured to him via an Arn in her brain. The two were rescued by the Twelfth Doctor and brought to Coal Hill Academy, where the prince took on the name \"Charlie Smith\" and Andra'ath the name \"Miss Quill\". On Earth, Miss Quill was able to remove the Arn in her brain with the aid of Ballon.\n\nThe Raak was a sea monster experimented on by Crozier in \"Mindwarp\".\nThe Racnoss appeared in the Tenth Doctor story \"The Runaway Bride\" in 2006.\n\nThe Racnoss are described by the Tenth Doctor as an ancient race of aliens from the Dark Times of the universe. Half-humanoid, half-arachnid in appearance, they were an invasion force who consumed everything on the planets they conquered. Their race was wiped out by the Fledgling Empires, over 4.6 billion years ago. Although the Time Lords are not specified as being a part of the Empires, the Doctor acknowledges that his people unravelled their power source, Huon particles, and upon hearing the name of the Doctor's planet, Gallifrey, the Empress claims that they \"murdered\" the Racnoss. The Doctor and Donna Noble are shown witnessing nearly all of the survivors of the race escape in their ship to where the Earth would later form, serving in place of a planetesimal as its core, hibernating for billions of years, with the exception of their Empress. The Doctor notes that because the Huon particles ceased to exist, the surviving Racnoss are stuck in hibernation. The Empress is seen coming to Earth in her ship, the Webstar in this episode, seeking to use the Huon particles which had been recreated by the Torchwood Institute using the water of the River Thames as a means of reviving her \"children\" before feasting on the human population of Earth. The last Racnoss are presumed wiped out when the Doctor drains the waters of the Thames down the shaft leading to their ship; the Empress is killed when her own ship is destroyed by the British army at the order of \"Mr Saxon\".\n\nThe Empress appears briefly in a flashback in \"Turn Left\" (2008). In the parallel universe created by Donna, she has still been defeated, but the Doctor, without Donna to stop him and ultimately save his life, is shown having drowned; a UNIT soldier speculates that he died \"too fast for him to regenerate\"; without his protection, the Earth is shown becoming a dystopia over the next few years.\n\nThe Racnoss also appear in the \"\" audio \"Empire of the Racnoss\", which sees the Fifth Doctor being drawn into the war against the Racnoss in the distant past when a call for help during the war is picked up by a long-dormant program in the TARDIS, resulting in the Doctor being caught up in a political struggle between the Empress of the Racnoss and her traitorous old consort and her replacement consort.\nNative to Raxacoricofallapatorius, Raxacoricofallapatorians are grouped by extended family names which are sometimes used to refer to their species generically. They hatch from eggs and are composed of living calcium. Capital punishment is practised on the home world, which involves immersion of convicted criminals in acid that slowly dissolves them while still alive.\n\nThe Slitheen family are a ruthless criminal sect motivated by profit. Convicted for their crimes on Raxacoricofallapatorius, they have been exiled from their homeworld and face execution if they return.\n\nThe Blathereen family are sworn enemies of the Slitheen, and have infiltrated the prison on the planet Justicia.\n\nA Raxacoricofallapatorian appears in an alien bar in \"The End of Time\".\n\nReapers appeared in the Ninth Doctor episode \"Father's Day\", written by Paul Cornell. Although not named on screen, they were referred to as \"Reapers\" in the publicity material for the episode. The production team based their design on the Grim Reaper, with their tails shaped like scythes.\n\nReapers are multi-limbed, flying creatures similar to pterosaurs, with a large wingspan, sharp teeth both in the form of a beak and a secondary mouth in their torsos, coupled with a rapacious attitude. The Reapers are apparently extradimensional, materialising and dematerialising out of the spacetime vortex. They are attracted to temporal paradoxes that damage time, like bacteria swarming around a wound. They then proceed to \"sterilise\" the wound by consuming everyone in sight. The older the thing they devour the more it satisfies them.\n\nOnce in this dimension, however, they can be blocked by material barriers. The older the barriers, the more effective they are, but even the oldest of barriers cannot stop them forever. Paradoxes can also allow them to directly materialise at the spot of the paradox. If the timeline is restored, they vanish, with their actions reversed as if they had never happened.\n\nIn \"Father's Day\", the Doctor explained that when the Time Lords were still around, there were laws to prevent the spread of paradoxes and that such paradoxes could be repaired. This implies that the Reapers are a natural phenomenon whose manifestation could be prevented if the paradox was resolved quickly. However, with the elimination of the other Time Lords in the Time War, there was no longer any agency that could repair time.\n\nThe Rhodians were a humanoid species that ruled the planet Rhodia and had a long history of war with the Quill. All the Rhodians and the Quill were killed by the Shadow Kin, except the Prince of Rhodia and the Quill freedom fighter who was indentured to him. The two were rescued by the Twelfth Doctor and brought to Coal Hill Academy, where the prince took on the name \"Charlie Smith\" and Andra'ath the name \"Miss Quill\". Charlie managed to bring the Cabinet of Souls with him to Earth, a device that contained the souls of all the fallen Rhodians, which he later used to wipe out all the Shadow Kin when they invaded Earth.\n\nAn alien species in an endless war with the Sontarans, the Rutans appear as jellyfish-like glowing green spheres. Like the Zygons, Rutans can shapeshift at will. They are also vulnerable to certain sound frequencies.\n\nSaturnyn are vampiric, lobster-like aliens that battled the Eleventh Doctor in 16th-century Venice in \"The Vampires of Venice\" (2010). Their appearance is quite obviously fear-inducing due to many sharp protrusions and fangs. They were able to breathe underwater and had vampire-like qualities such as a vulnerability to sunlight, no reflections and a thirst for human blood. However, these are easily explainable; as \"fish from space\", they are used to living in the dark depths; anyone's mind cannot deal with conflicting information of a perception filter and a Saturnyn's true reflection; Rosanna and Francesco drank the blood of the girls attending the school so they could replace it with their own. Their leader, Signora Rosanna Calvierri used a perception filter to appear as a human woman, who started a school for girls; it was a guise for seeking victims to be transformed into mates for Francesco's brothers. They planned to flood Venice in an attempt to continue their civilization since their own planet Saturnyne was destroyed by cracks in the universe. When the Doctor foiled their plan, Rosanna committed suicide by allowing her brood to devour her. However, when the Doctor rewrote time in \"The Big Bang\" (2010) by preventing the cracks' existence, it is highly likely Saturnyne was not destroyed by the cracks and the Calvierri family did not end.\n\nThe Doctor, at least in his eleventh incarnation, considered his adventure battling the Saturnyens to be memorable. In \"A Good Man Goes to War\" (2011), he said his adventures were \"running about, sexy, fish vampires, and blowing up stuff\", and even asked Melody Pond if Amy told her about the \"Vampires in Venice\" during \"Let's Kill Hitler\" (2011).\n\nStraw-filled foot soldiers created by Son of Mine, using molecular fringe animation. They were relentless and untiring, with rudimentary intelligence. Even after being cut down by machine-gun fire, they could be reanimated. In a perfect sense of irony, Son of Mine was frozen in time and dressed up as a scarecrow, to watch over England's fields.\n\nAnother type of scarecrow which came alive were set to appear in the unmade movie \"Doctor Who Meets Scratchman\".\n\nSea Devils were turtle-like humanoids that lived in Earth's oceans millions of years before humans evolved. They believed that a small planet would crash into Earth, which instead became Earth's moon. Like the Silurians, they went into hibernation and wanted to take the planet back from humans when they awoke.\n\nAn unnamed gaseous alien parasite that comes to Earth to feed on orgasmic energy in \"Day One\" (2006), claiming that there's no other energy in the universe like it; it's possible that orgasmic energy is like a drug to the gas, and that it's addicted. Composed of vorax and ceranium gases, Earth's atmosphere is poisonous to the alien, so it needs to take a human host to survive for prolonged periods; it doesn't show up on cameras. It vies for control with its host, causing physiological changes that will eventually cause the host's internal organs to explode.\n\nThe alien also makes its host secrete a blend of ultra-powerful pheromones that cause tremendous sexual attraction in those around it for the purposes of feeding; those with stronger wills might be able to resist the pheromones. Coupling with the host is fatal, causing the host's partner to disintegrate into a pile of dust at climax and allowing the alien to absorb the energy from the orgasm. It appeared to know human biology well (or at least just enough), knowing it needed the opposite gender in order to get the energy. It was tricked out of its host and left in a portable energy prison until it expired from being poisoned by the earth's air.\n\nThe BBC Torchwood website lists it as the \"Sex gas\". Producer Russell T Davies, in the documentary series \"Torchwood Declassified\", refers to it as a \"sex monster\".\n\nThis creature served as a way of showing that Torchwood's stories could go places that Doctor Who's children-friendly stories could not.\n\nA member of an unknown race who served the Black Guardian. His face was blank, except for the vague impressions of the shape of a skull; he wore what seemed like dark ceremonial robes.\n\nThe Shadow Kin were a race of fire-type humanoids from the Underneath. The Shadow Kin could exist as pure shadow and in a solid form, but could only survive physically with the presence of a shadow. They were ruled by the Shadow King, who ruled from the Shadow Palace on the Underneath. The Shadow Kin arrived on Rhodia in the midst of a civil war and killed all the Rhodians and Quills save the Rhodian prince Charlie Smith and his Quill protector Miss Quill, who were rescued by the Twelfth Doctor and brought to Coal Hill Academy. Following them to Earth, the Shadow Kin, led by Corakinus, emerged through a tear in space-time at the school's prom night but were forced back by the Doctor. During the invasion, when Coal Hill student April MacLean fired a displacement gun at Corakinus and Charlie pushed her out of the way, she and Corakinus began sharing April's heart. April found her way to the Shadow Palace and defeated Corakinus in battle. She became the new king, and had the Shadow Kin lock up Corakinus. However, they later returned to invade Earth again under Corakinus' command. Charlie decided to use a displacement gun to kill April and Corakinus, thus allowing Charlie to become the new Shadow King. As King, he ordered his army to retreat, and then he used the Cabinet of Souls to wipe all the Shadow Kin out of existence. After he used the cabinet, April resurrected but in Corakinus' body.\n\nThe Shakri are a species spoken of in Gallifreyan myths, said to be the \"pest controllers of the universe\"; Amy Pond found it a \"strange choice for a bed-time story\". They attack any species that they believe will pose a threat to the universe, hence why they tried eliminating humanity in the 21st century, years before they could colonise space in the future. A hologram of a wrinkled humanoid in a black robe was seen on the Shakri ship; however, it is not known if this is actually what the Shakri look like. The Shakri consider seven an important number, given they used that amount of portals, ships, cube activation time, and for a countdown. They follow something known as \"the Tally\"; the Doctor has implied that the Shakri compare a species' failures and successes to decide whether or not they will be subjected to \"pest control\".\n\nThe Shalka appear to be a serpentine alien race made of living rock and magma, but they are actually bioplasmic entities, living plasma, their physical appearance merely a \"crust\" concealing their true forms. They breathe volcanic air and prefer high temperatures, being most comfortable underground where lava meets metamorphic rock. They communicate through high-pitched screaming, which they can use for a variety of effects, like tunnelling through rock or mentally controlling other life forms. They also use sound as a part of their technology.\n\nIn an alternate timeline, the Shalka arrived on Earth via meteorite, initially landing near Mount Ruapehu, New Zealand, subsequently establishing a beachhead for their planned invasion of Earth beneath the Lancashire town of Lannet. They also created a stable wormhole for landing their invasion force, which could also be converted into a black hole to dispose of their enemies, as they tried to do with the Doctor.\n\nAs they claimed to have done to billions of planets before, they intended to implant Shalka larvae into key segments of the population, mind controlling them into emitting a scream that would destroy the ozone layer. In this way, the Shalka intended to raise the surface temperature of the planet to the point where the human race would perish but the Shalka could thrive. The Shalka would then live beneath the surface, with the rest of the universe believing that Earth's inhabitants had died of self-inflicted ecological damage. The Doctor defeated their plans with the help of the British military and a Lannet barmaid named Alison.\nThey are not technically Doctor Who monsters since they appeared in a failed attempt to restart the series before it was permanently revived.\n\nAn alien race said to have large foreheads.\n\nThe Shansheeth are a race of vulture-like aliens which appear in \"Death of the Doctor\" by Russell T Davies. A fleet of Shansheeth announce to Sarah Jane via UNIT the death of the Doctor, and take charge of the funeral procession; Mr Smith confirms their status as the undertakers of the universe, finding fallen heroes on battlefields. However, the band of Shansheeth Sarah Jane and former companion Jo Jones (Katy Manning) encounter want to use the companions' memories of the Doctor, in conjunction with their Memory Weave device to create a TARDIS key with which they can steal the TARDIS and prevent death across the timeline. Sarah and Jo, instead, overload the device, which blows up and destroys the Shansheeth along with their UNIT accomplice. The main branch of the Shansheeth later apologise to Sarah Jane for the actions of this rogue group.\n\n\"Simon\" was an alien mentioned on the Torchwood website, specifically in an article attached to, and especially in, Amanda Davies' diary. He was travelling on Earth, seeking to discover the source of life. He wandered into a countryside village and was taken in by the Davies family. Simon, having based his appearance on Jon Bon Jovi, near-instantly seduced the family's daughter - Amanda, and ultimately left her pregnant with an alien baby (which itself quickly developed, and began to degrade her health). Simon then disappeared around the same time as Jack Harkness arrived (implying he had been captured or killed by Torchwood), and later Jack met with Amanda's father and (apparently) made an agreement to have the entire village, including Amanda, subjected to amnesia pills, have all records and evidence that the Davies' existed in the village (including Amanda's diary) confiscated, have the alien baby removed before Amanda died, and then send the Davies family away with a new identity.\n\nSelf-proclaimed \"Sentinels of History\", the Silence are genetically engineered members of the Papal Mainframe under the Academy of the Question. As they were originally created as confessional priests, Silents cannot be remembered unless they are being looked at, or if someone is wearing an eyedrive. In \"The Time of the Doctor\" (2013), with the Doctor's enemies converging on Trenzalore, the Papal Mainframe underwent a faith conversion into the Church of the Silence whose main belief is that \"Silence will fall\" to keep the Doctor from answering the oldest question in the universe \"Doctor Who?\" to avert a war caused by the Time Lords' return. However, a group of Silents under a splinter chapel led by Madam Kovarian wanted to completely avoid the Siege of Trenzalore by eliminating the Doctor: their attempts range from destroying reality in Series 5, which caused the events at Trenzalore, and using Melody Pond in an attempt to murder the Doctor in Series 6. The Silents still loyal to the Papal Mainframe remain and joined forces with the Doctor to fight back all the villains converging on Trenzalore.\n\nThe Siren is a virtual doctor that was aboard a spaceship of an unknown alien race that crashed in a dimension parallel to the ocean the ship \"Fancy\" was sailing on in 1699. Thanks to \"protein circuitry\", she could appear before a species in a form that would be alluring to them for cooperation. To sedate her patients, the Siren could sing a beautiful vocal song. However, being nothing more than a program, the Siren had very little reasoning skills. The Siren turned red with demonic-looking face when faced with resistance and germs. When the ship she was doctor to crashed in a spatial rift where the \"Fancy\" had been becalmed (and the crew dead from a human disease), she impulsively started to take the injured of the ship, even if it was for a simple cut, showing a great lack of intelligence. Were it not for the Doctor's arrival, the Siren would eventually have reached shore and started trying to process anyone who was ill. Captain Henry Avery, Toby Avery and the crew of the \"Fancy\" took over the ship to give her someone to look after, and to see the universe.\n\nA race of humanoids from the star Sirius.\n\nA female religion in charge of the Elixir of Eternal Life. The Elixir has remarkable healing properties, such as aiding Time Lords undergoing difficult regenerations; the Fourth Doctor was given some after brain damage in a mental duel with Morbius. Other potions that the Sisterhood brew can allow Time Lords to choose what their next incarnation will be like; they range from age, weight, strength, emotion, sex and mindset. Seeing the person he had been for all his regenerations wasn't suited to combat the terror of the Time War, the Eighth Doctor choose a potion that would turn him into a Warrior.\n\nA creature brought to Earth by the Zygons that became the Loch Ness Monster.\n\nSkullions are one-eyed extraterrestrials, originating from the planet Skultos. They are hydrophobic, meaning water will burn the Skullions in a torturous way. It is stated they can only drink citric juices.\n\nIn \"The Man Who Never Was\" (2011), a Skullion ship crashed into China where the aliens were sold at a black market to Harrison, who uses them as slaves, attaching collars to their necks as torturing devices.\nSarah Jane Smith and her friends were able to save them though, contacting their home planet. A rescue ship arrives, beaming up the Skullions and Harrison, who refused to let them escape.\n\nThe sky fish are fish-like creature capable of swimming through the air using the electricity of the planet Ember's crystalline fog. They are attracted to music as it causes the crystals in the fog to resonate in a way that produces delta waves. They vary from small fish to fully grown sharks.\n\nThe Slitheen are a family of massive, bipedal extraterrestrials. They are creatures of living calcium, hatched from eggs and native to the planet Raxacoricofallapatorius. While, strictly speaking, the name \"Slitheen\" refers to a specific family, the term has been used by the Doctor to refer to the Raxacoricofallapatorian race in general.\n\nThe Slitheen are able to wear a human's skin as a disguise, using a compression field to shrink themselves. As they are mostly made of calcium, they are vulnerable to acetic acid (vinegar).\n\nThe Slitheen have appeared in the \"Doctor Who\" episodes \"Aliens of London\", \"World War Three\" and \"Boom Town\" and the interactive episode, \"Attack of the Graske\" (all 2005). \"From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love\", a mini episode of \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" for Comic Relief, featured Ronnie Corbett as a small Slitheen. They have also appeared in \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" episodes \"Revenge of the Slitheen\" and \"The Lost Boy\".\n\nThe Slitheen are mentioned as being part of The Alliance formed to trap the Doctor in \"The Pandorica Opens\" (2010).\n\nThe Slyther was a monster that served the Daleks. It was seen in episodes four and five of \"The Dalek Invasion of Earth\" (1964), guarding the Dalek mines in Bedfordshire. After the Slyther attacked a small group of humans, killing Ashton, Ian hit it with a rock, causing it to fall down a pit to its death.\n\nThe Solonians are a race of humanoid creatures from the planet Solos, colonized by the Overlords. The atmosphere contains a nitrogen isotope which causes the air to become toxic to humans in sunlight, although it has no effect on Solonians. Because Solos' environment changes drastically every 500 years, they must undergo major mutations periodically in order to survive.\n\nA Sontaran first appeared as the antagonist in the Third Doctor serial \"The Time Warrior\" (1973–74). The Sontarans were referred to in \"Eye of the Gorgon\" by Bea who said they looked like a huge potato with a raygun. Commander Kaagh appears in Series 2 in the story \"The Last Sontaran\" after the destruction of his battle fleet as well as the death of the other Sontarans on board in the \"Doctor Who\" two-parter episodes \"The Sontaran Strategem\" and \"The Poison Sky\" (2008). He returns in \"Enemy of the Bane\", where he sides up with Mrs Wormwood, the recurring Bane. In the end, he sacrifices himself to foil her plans of the destruction of Earth. He makes a small appearance in \"The Pandorica Opens\" (2010). The Sontarans remain slightly miffed that they weren't allowed to fight in the Time War.\n\nAs seen with Strax, Sontarans can't tell the difference between men and women (\"Two genders is a bit further than [they] can count\"), and think polite terms such as Miss or Mister are military ranks.\n\nThe Spiridons featured in the serial \"Planet of the Daleks\" (1973). They are the dominant species of sentient humanoids on planet Spiridon in the Ninth System. They have developed a form of invisibility, capable of generating \"anti-reflecting light waves\". They become visible after death, having pale skin and a gaunt appearance. They wear heavy purple fur cloaks at night to protect themselves from the harsh nights of Spiridon. The Doctor returns to Spiridon in spin-off audio adventures \"Return of the Daleks\" and \"Brotherhood of the Daleks\".\n\nThe star whale is a giant whale-like creature, presumed to be the last of its kind, used to pilot the Starship UK, so as to save its citizens from the dangerous solar flares. The whale has the features of other animals such as an anglerfish angler, an octopus' tentacles and a scorpions' tail, as well as having a bright pink hide with bioluminescent patches. It arrived on Earth as it heard the children of the United Kingdom crying, and was unable to bear the sound. Believing its arrival to be a one-in-a-million miracle, the people of Britain captured it and built their ship around it, torturing it via powerful electric pulses, administered directly into the opened pain center of the Whale's brain, in order to keep the ship flying. Over the years, they realised that they could not justify keeping the creature in agony, but feared that if they set it free, the ship and all those aboard would be destroyed as the creature fled, so they chose to instead forget, and fed those who protested to the beast. When the Doctor learnt of this, he decided to render the creature brain-dead, ending its suffering and saving the lives of all those on the ship, but Amy set it free, revealing that the whale had volunteered to help, and that contrary to the beliefs of the station's masters, that it would continue flying without the need to torture it. The creature's exact size is not specified, and it is only visible in its entirety towards the episode's ending.\n\nThe Stenza are a warrior race who possess sub-zero body temperatures. As physical contact with any part of them can cause death from sub-zero burns, Stenza require the use of specialised suits to be able to interact safely with other lifeforms. The Stenza maintain two traditions amongst their people - a ritualistic hunt to earn the right of leadership, in which a Stenza hunts a randomly selected quarry without the use of weapons or any form of aid; and collecting a tooth from a kill to later apply to their face. The Stenza are noted for conducting ethnic cleansing on planets they conquer, as revealed in \"The Ghost Monument\", using the conquered populace to create weapons for their use.\n\nA species that appears similar to large, furry rats; they are carnivorous. The last of the Stigorax was adopted by Helen A, who named it Fifi and took care of it. Fifi was released into sewer pipes to chase and devour escaping criminals. Fifi was later fatally wounded by a collapsing pipe, managing to climb out just in time for Helen A to find it. Fifi's death showed Helen A that sadness could not be prevented.\n\nGreen-skinned, green-haired natives of the third moon of Delta Magma. Other than their colour, they appear similar to humans. Swampies are intelligent but primitive, lacking technology. They worship a giant squid-like creature called Kroll. Throughout \"The Power of Kroll\", only male Swampies are seen.\n\nAlso known by the Unified Intelligence-Taskforce (UNIT) as Stingrays, they are flying manta ray-like creatures, with metal exoskeletons that allow them to travel from planet to planet via wormholes. They consume everything on a planet, turning it into desert; and then swarm over the planet's surface, generating a wormhole which allows them to travel to the next planet.\n\nThe Stingrays are apparently arthropods, as they are exothermic, and possess an exoskeleton composed of metal that has been ingested then exuded to the exoskeleton. They are voracious feeders, eating both organic and inorganic materials ranging from flesh and bone to plant matter to metals and plastic. They also produce vast numbers of young and grow from birth to adult in under a year, as shown when the Tenth Doctor shows a year-old clip of San Helios before its Stingray infestation.\n\nThey travel to other planets through wormholes created in the fabric of Spacetime by circling a planet faster and faster, and as each swarm can contain billions of giant stingrays, they rip a hole in space. Their wormholes can transport the whole swarm an infinite distance through space.\n\nThe Sycorax first appeared in the debut Tenth Doctor story \"The Christmas Invasion\" in 2005.\n\nThe Sycorax appear to be skinless humanoids wearing mantles of bone, usually keeping their features concealed under helmets. They are proficient in the use of weapons like swords and whips, the latter which can deliver an energy discharge that disintegrates the flesh of its target. Their language is called Sycoraxic. The Sycorax also appear to have technology that is either disguised or treated as magic, referring to \"curses\" and the Doctor's regenerative abilities as \"witchcraft\". The Sycorax leader referred to an \"armada\" that they could use to take Earth by force if their blood control plan failed. They also appear to have a martial society, with traditions of honourable combat, yet they have no qualms about killing prisoners.\n\nAccording to a write-up by Russell T Davies on the BBC website, the Sycorax facial structure was inspired by the skull of a horse. According to the same write-up, the Sycorax originated on an asteroid in the distant JX82 system, known as the Fire Trap. They were uplifted when a spaceship crashed on their asteroid and the Sycorax Leader enslaved the survivors, forcing the aliens to teach them about their technology. The asteroid was then retrofitted into the first of many spaceships, which the Sycorax then used to raid other planets, becoming feared interstellar scavengers. This reputation is made clear in their attitude to other 'inferior' races. The Sycorax leader comments to Rose that he would not 'dirty his tongue' with her language, and their translated word for 'human' can also be taken to mean 'cattle'. Their armada is permanently in orbit around the Jewel of Staa Crafell.\n\nIn \"The Doctor Who Files\" books, the name of the Sycorax homeworld is given as \"Sycorax\". It is unclear if this is another name for the Fire Trap. Furthermore, after the destruction of the Fire Trap, the Sycorax spread further through the galaxy, and like humans are one of three species that continually survive and adapt, even unto the End of the Universe.\n\nThe name Sycorax is used in William Shakespeare's play \"The Tempest\". Shakespeare's Sycorax has died before the play begins; she is described as a witch who was the mother of the beast Caliban. The Shakespearean name is referenced in the third series episode \"The Shakespeare Code\" when the Doctor finds a horse's skull in The Globe's prop cupboard. He comments that it \"Reminds [him] too much of the Sycorax\". Shakespeare remarks he likes the sound of the word, obviously then going on to use it in \"The Tempest\".\n\nThe Sycorax also make a brief appearance in \"The Pandorica Opens\" (2010) as part of The Alliance formed to trap the Doctor. Later, in \"The Name of the Doctor\" (2013), the Great Intelligence mentions them as one of those that left the Doctor blood-soaked.\n\nIn issue #1 of the IDW published Doctor Who comic book, a Sycorax is collecting near-extinct species to use with shape-shifters for expensive hunts. The Sycorax race also make a return in the Tenth Doctor comic strip \"The Widow's Curse\", in \"Doctor Who Magazine\" #395. The DWM comic story is the first appearance of female Sycorax, who seem to operate separately from the males.\n\nIn the audio series \"\", the Seventh Doctor faces the Sycorax in the audio \"Harvest of the Sycorax\", where he has to stop their efforts to take control of a space station that contains blood samples taken from virtually the entire human race of the far future.\n\nThe Tenza are an alien species that has their young raised by other species. Put simply, \"a Tenza's sole function is to fit in.\" They adapt perfectly to what their foster parents want, such as \"George\" becoming the son Claire was unable to give birth to. Tenzas have powerful psychic abilities such being able to create monsters with just their imagination, as well as mentally creating massive perception filters that alter their foster parents' memories. Since George didn't seem aware of his nature as a Tenza, the young of his species must do these things subconsciously or simply forget their true identities to blend in perfectly. The Doctor has said that Tenza puberty is \"always a funny time\", and said he might be back to deal with George again if something else goes awry.\n\nThe Terileptils appeared in the Fifth Doctor serial \"The Visitation\" by Eric Saward. They are a reptilian humanoid species, they cannot survive long without breathing soliton gas, which is highly combustible when combined with oxygen. As an advanced society, they enjoy a heightened appreciation of both aesthetics and warfare, and have been known to employ bejewelled androids. Criminal punishment in Terileptil society includes life imprisonment working in tinclavic mines on the planet Raaga, often with sub-standard medical care.\n\nIn 1666, a group of Terileptil prison escapees hidden near London attempted to use a genetically enhanced version of the Black Plague to destroy humanity. The destruction of their lab in Pudding Lane caused the Great Fire of London.\n\nThe Terileptils destroyed the Sonic screwdriver which did not appear again until the \"Doctor Who\" TV movie.\n\nThe Terileptils are mentioned as being part of The Alliance formed to trap the Doctor in \"The Pandorica Opens\" (2010). They were also present during the siege of Trenzalore. A Terileptil is briefly shown as one of the criminals displayed by Psi in \"Time Heist\" (2014).\n\nAccording to the Virgin Missing Adventures novel \"The Dark Path\" by David A. McIntee, by the 34th century, their homeworld Terileptus is a member of the Galactic Federation, and a noted builder of starships. A Terileptil also appears as the chief engineer on a Federation starship. The planet is destroyed during the events described in the novel.\n\nA race that lives in the Kondonian Belt, but is very few in number. The Eleventh Doctor knows their language and customs well, exchanging a greeting with one at the Festival of Offerings.\n\nThe Tetraps are a bat-like race from the planet Tetrapyriarbus. A pack of Tetraps was employed by the Rani to help defend her Giant Brain in the Seventh Doctor's debut story, \"Time and the Rani\" (1987) by Pip and Jane Baker. The Rani armed a pack of Tetraps for this purpose and used them as general henchmen to terrorise the native Lakertyans.\n\nTetraps have four eyes, one on each side of their head, giving them all-round vision, and put this to good use in stalking fugitives. Like bats, they sleep by hanging upside-down in a cavern. They feed off a dark red-coloured sludge that the Lakertyan leader releases down a chute into a trough.\n\nTetraps possess limited intelligence, but they soon realise that the Rani's plans would have them all killed on Lakertya. This is confirmed when their leader, Urak, hears of her plans and she later leaves him to guard over her laboratory rather than take him with her in her TARDIS, thus condemning him to death. Urak and the enraged Tetraps capture the Rani in her ship and take her back to their home planet, to force her to help solve their natural resource shortages.\n\nThe Thals are a race of peaceful, blond humanoids who, together with the Daleks, are natives of the planet Skaro. Once a warlike species, a nuclear conflict with the Daleks, which nearly wiped out all life on their home planet, led them to develop a pacifist, agrarian society.\n\nThe Time Beetle is a member of the \"Trickster's Brigade\", a group of aliens that serve the Trickster. The Time Beetle, similar to the Trickster himself, feeds on time energy and can cause a victim to change a decision they made in the past, thereby altering history. The change in history is usually very minor, affecting only the person the beetle attaches to, and the universe usually \"compensates\" for the discrepancy.\n\nWhen the beetle attaches to Donna in \"Turn Left\" (2008), instead of compensating it creates a \"great big parallel world\" where Donna never meets the Doctor, resulting in disaster for Earth. The Doctor, Martha Jones, Sarah Jane Smith, and Torchwood staff Ianto Jones and Gwen Cooper were all killed, the city of London was completely destroyed when the \"Titanic\" crashes into Buckingham Palace, Captain Jack Harkness is taken to the Sontaran homeworld, and millions of people die from threats the Doctor would have otherwise prevented. Donna travels back in time to make her make the original decision that leads to her meeting the Doctor, killing the Beetle. According to both the Doctor and Donna, this universe ceased to exist.\n\nIn an accompanying \"Monster Files\" episode, Captain Jack raised doubts over whether the whole of the Trickster's Brigade consists of beetles, suggesting all individuals are of different species.\n\nIn the \"Torchwood\" episode \"Immortal Sins\" (2011), the \"Trickster's Brigade\" is mentioned as they attempt to cause the victory of Nazi Germany by assassinating Franklin Delano Roosevelt through a parasite.\n\nA creation of the Rani's by pooling the intelligence of all the most brilliant minds of history together. She sought to find the light-weight counterpart to Strange Matter, in order to capture a large amount of it,\n\nThe Time Lords are a race of humanoid aliens to which the Doctor, among other characters, belongs. Time Lords have the ability to regenerate when mortally wounded. This process creates for them an entirely new body and results in major changes in personality, but retains the Time Lord's memories and identity. It is suggested in \"The Power of the Daleks\" (1966) that some detectable feature is retained, as the Daleks are immediately able to recognize the Second Doctor, even though he has just regenerated. During \"The Time of the Doctor\" (2013), it was confirmed by the Eleventh Doctor that a Time-Lord, naturally, is only allowed 12 regenerations, resulting in 13 different incarnations. In the same episode, the Doctor saves Clara's life by sending her home to her own time, but in protest she clings to the TARDIS through the Time Vortex on its return. Upon arriving 300 years later, she finds a visibly aged Doctor, proving that Time Lords experience natural physical changes during each lifespan between regenerations. In the episode \"A Good Man Goes to War\" (2011), it is suggested this ability evolved due to the Time Lord race's long-term exposure to the untempered schism.\n\nTime Lords exhibit various other superhuman abilities, including certain mental powers, and resistance to otherwise harmful effects such as extreme cold and radiation. They possess a binary vascular system (two hearts), and therefore a faster heart rate, as well as a cooler internal body temperature. The Doctor would later claim that Time Lords came before humans did in \"The Beast Below\" (2010).\n\nThe first Time Lord to appear other than the Doctor and his granddaughter Susan Foreman is the Monk, in the 1965 serial \"The Time Meddler\", but the term itself is not used until \"The War Games\" (1969), when the race as a whole is introduced.\n\nAs of the 2005 revival series, the Time Lords are essentially extinct, apart from the Doctor, as they have been destroyed by him during the Time War. However, \"The Day of the Doctor\" (2013) shows that this was a ruse; the Time Lords are still alive in pocket universe, where everyone one of the Doctors put them to save them from destruction.\n\nCreatures that appeared in \"Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS\" (2013). They are echoes of the possible future selves that the Doctor, Clara, Trickey and Gregor would have become from being exposed to the Eye of Harmony too long; they were burnt by it as their cells liquified. It appeared that they lacked most of their former intelligence, along with the ability to speak. However, each may have been driven by a particular motive - the Doctor wanted the part of the Arch Rec back from Gregor, Clara could have wanted revenge on the Van Baalens for being the cause of all the trouble, and Gregor and Tricky would want revenge for being mutated into a monster. Each could be identitified, although not as easily with the Doctor and Clara, because of how they changed; the Doctor is stuck holding his head, and the Van Baalens are stuck to each other.\n\nUnlike the other time echoes, they could touch the present world, and killed Bram Van Baalen. They end up trapping their past selves in the Eye of Harmony's room by accident, setting up the existence of the Time Zombies. The Doctor realised how to avert the future, killing all but Clara's echo by knocking them off the rail. However, the Van Baalens couldn't avoid their fate. The Doctor eventually prevented the existence of these things by resetting time, preventing the TARDIS from being damaged and salvaged by the Van Baalen Brothers.\n\nThe Tivolians are a cowardly rodent-faced race that live on Tivoli, the most invaded planet in the galaxy. As a result, they have designed their cities to be comfortable for invading armies and their national anthem is \"Glory To <Insert Name Here>\". They are known for surrendering as soon as possible, and actually enjoy being conquered. As a result of the natives' cowardly attitudes, the planet Tivoli has lasted longer than any of the greater civilizations. They do not assert their own opinions often, just wishing to be ordered around or enslaved, as seen in the case of Gibbis and Albar Prentis. The Twelfth Doctor says that Tivolians wouldn't say 'Boo' to a goose—they'd be more likely to give the goose their car keys and bank account information. Among the list of those who ruled the Tivolians are the Fisher King and the \"glorious Arcateenians”.\n\nThe Toclafane are the last remnants of humanity from the year 100 trillion. Originally intending to travel to Utopia, the last refuge of a dying universe, they find nothing but \"the dark and the cold\" of space. Losing the last shred of hope they had, they turned on themselves, cannibalising their own bodies to create a new cyborg race. As part of this process they regress into little more than children with shared memories. The name Toclafane is given to them by the Master, who takes it from the Gallifreyan equivalent of the bogeyman.\n\nThe Toclafane's cyborg forms possess energy devices capable of killing and disintegrating targets. They are equipped with numerous retractable blades. The first four to be seen also exhibit apparent teleportation or cloaking abilities, not displayed by others of their race. All that remains of their bodies are barely recognisable human faces wired into basketball-sized mechanical spheres.\n\nIn \"The Sound of Drums\"/\"Last of the Time Lords\" (2007), the Master rescues four Toclafane from the end of the universe prior to an eventual Big Freeze, using them to fake a first contact situation in order to draw the world's leaders into one place for easy capture. He then uses a \"paradox machine\" to allow the future of the human race to slaughter many in the present, in short bringing the six billion humans that are alive in the year 100 trillion to return in the form of the Toclafane. The paradox machine creates a temporal paradox, allowing them to kill their ancestors without damaging themselves, and thus establish the Master's rule over Earth. After subduing Earth, the Master aims to establish a new Time Lord empire with himself as the leader and the Toclafane as his people and ground troops. This plan is foiled when the paradox machine is destroyed, causing time to rewind and trapping the Toclafane back at the end of the universe.\n\nThe Toclafane feature on the cover of the New Series Adventures novel, \"The Story of Martha\", which chronicles Martha Jones's adventures during The Year That Never Was.\n\nA sentient star featured in the episode \"42\". The crew of a cargo ship uses a sun scoop on Torajii to refuel their ship, unaware that it is actually a living organism. Torajii then uses the stolen matter to possess and kill the crew until the fuel is returned. Once the sun scoop is dumped, it allows the ship to fly away.\n\nA humanoid species, with great intelligence, that live on the peaceful planet of Traken, which is part of the Traken Union. A Keeper is chosen to guard the Source once the life of the current one draws close to ending. Their planet would petrify anything evil that would arrive, until the Keeper's life began waning and thus the petrification would weaken. During \"Logopolis\" (1981), the Master caused the destruction of the Traken Union and its people by unleashing entropy back into the universe, leaving Nyssa (as far as she or anyone knew) the sole Trakenite in existence.\n\nTravist Polong is an orange, metre-long, five-eyed slug/slater-like alien. Sarah Jane attempted to catch it at a hospital at Tarminster in \"The Mark of the Berserker\" (2008), but left to deal with a Berserker.\n\nTravist Polong was later delivered to Sarah Jane in \"The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith\" (2009) after she saw it on eBay in its dormant stage. Rani and Clyde took it inside Rani's house, but it escaped. They chased it to 13 Bannerman Road, where they caught it in a garbage can. Sarah Jane directed Rani to order Mr Smith to teleport it to Polongus, its home planet. Sarah Jane described Travist Polong as \"not evil, just trouble\".\n\nThe Trickster is a being beyond the universe which seeks to manifest itself through causing chaos. It can interfere in deaths, by making deceptive deals to prolong life at a price. It can only exist within the universe for brief periods, without physical form, sometimes in a mirror or other reflective surface. It is a member of the Pantheon of Discord. Played by Paul Marc Davis, the Trickster is a recurring nemesis in \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\". Though the character does not directly appear in the series' related programmes (parent show \"Doctor Who\" and adult sister show \"Torchwood\"), the Trickster's attempts to change history have nevertheless been depicted.\n\nIn \"Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane?\", in order to create chaos of sufficient magnitude, the Trickster removed Sarah Jane from history so that an asteroid that only she could have stopped would hit the Earth. The Trickster altered an incident in Sarah Jane's childhood in 1964 that originally led to the death of her best friend Andrea. The Trickster switched the places of the two girls after gaining Andrea's consent, creating a timeline in which Sarah Jane died at age 13. Preferring a meaningless destruction of Earth rather than for profit or military conquest, the Trickster also influenced the various alien threats Sarah Jane had faced on Earth to stay away from the planet, creating a peaceful timeline up until the impending asteroid strike. Keeping Sarah Jane in Limbo, it further planned to use her to find and remove the Doctor from history, which would create a timeline of diabolical chaos, wherein the many tragedies the Doctor averted would have instead proceeded.\n\nThe Time Beetle that consumes time energy by changing an individual's personal timeline in the \"Doctor Who\" episode \"Turn Left\" is described in the episode as one of \"the Trickster's Brigade\".\n\nIn \"The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith\", the Trickster returned with the Graske. It manifested in 1951 after Sarah Jane saved her parents' lives. By 2008 it had completely devastated the planet and enslaved the human population, and was working on conquering other planets. Sarah Jane returned to the point of his manifestation in an attempt to stop him, but could not think of a suitable method. Her parents willingly drive off in their car, leading to their death, causing the Trickster to vanish and the original time to be restored. The Trickster materialised through the Abbott's Gate at the old monastery in Sarah Jane's home village of Foxgrove. This entry point was razed for the construction of an A road in 1964.\n\nThe Trickster returned in \"The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith\", having made a deal with lawyer Peter Dalton after an accident at home, granting Dalton his life and the love he never had, Sarah Jane Smith. Sarah Jane fell in love with Dalton, and agreed to marry him, but the wedding was interrupted by the arrival of the Doctor. The Trickster took the hotel out of time, trapping Sarah Jane and Peter in one second while the Doctor, K9, Luke, Clyde and Rani were trapped in another. Realising that the Trickster intended for Sarah's marriage to end her life of defending the Earth, Sarah Jane convinced Peter that he must break the deal, sacrificing himself so that Sarah Jane could continue to save the world. The Trickster made reference to the Tenth Doctor's future regeneration and added that the Doctor's first meeting with the Pantheon of Discord had sent ripples back through time. The Trickster was revealed to be vulnerable to artron energy (the power source of the TARDIS). Clyde became charged with artron energy when he came in contact with the TARDIS while it was attempting to penetrate the Trickster's time rift. He was able to use the energy to harm the Trickster, draining its energy long enough for the Doctor to penetrate the Trickster's temporal trap.\n\nThe Trickster is briefly referenced in the \"\" episode \"Immortal Sins\". In the episode, Captain Jack Harkness and his lover/companion Angelo Colasanto intercept and destroy an alien parasite that the Trickster's brigade had planned to use to infect U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and create an alternate timeline where Nazi Germany won World War II.\n\nA shot of the Trickster is briefly shown in the 2014 \"Doctor Who\" episode \"Time Heist\", describing him as one of many of the galaxy's most notorious criminals. Considering he desires nothing but chaos, the Trickster is likely \"the\" most wanted criminal.\n\nThe Trickster's Brigade serve the recurring \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" villain, the Trickster. They also feed on chaos in time as the Trickster does. In \"Turn Left\", a Time Beetle, a member of \"The Trickster's Brigade\", attaches itself onto the back of companion Donna Noble, creating a parallel world where she never met the Doctor in \"The Runaway Bride\", leading to his death.\n\nIn the \"Torchwood\" episode \"Immortal Sins\", Jack Harkness and Angelo Colasanto discover that \"The Trickster's Brigade\" plans to cause the victory of Nazi Germany by assassinating Franklin Delano Roosevelt with the use of a brain parasite but Jack shoots it in the head, killing it instantly.\n\nA humanoid species, with no visible differences from humans, Trions are quite intelligent. A civil war broke out on the planet, and those on the wrong side were banished to different planets, Turlough ended up on Earth, while the rest of his family ended up on a volcanic planet. The descendants of the original exiles came to believe the mark of exile meant those who had it were chosen by their god, Mulkur, to lead them. After several years past, the exile was lifted from those banished from the planet, allowing them back home.\n\nHumanoid fly creatures, they trade with other civilisations for their excrement. They communicate with clicks that the TARDIS didn't translate because it was not on the same planet as The Doctor and Lady Christina de Souza. The Doctor speaks with them through their own language while they understand The Doctor through a one-way telepathic translating communication device.\n\nThe Usurians from the planet Usurius are a species that abandoned military conquest in favour of economic conquest. They enslaved humanity after their engineers made Mars suitable for human habitation, humans having depleted the Earth's resources. Once humanity had depleted Mars's resources as well, the Usurians engineered Pluto so that humans could inhabit it. They created six artificial \"Suns\" around it and installed the Collector to oversee the collection of taxes from their human workforce. They intended to abandon Pluto and leave humanity to become extinct once the humans had exhausted its resources, there being no economically viable planet to relocate humanity to once more. The humans on Pluto revolted against the Collector and seized control of Pluto. The revolutionaries intended to relocate to Earth as the Doctor assured them it would have regenerated in their absence.\n\nThe Usurians have knowledge of the Time Lords, graded as \"Grade 3\" in their \"latest market survey\", considering Gallifrey to be of low commercial value. Usurians can adopt a humanoid form but in their natural state they resemble seaweed. Shock can force them to revert to their natural form. According to the Doctor, Usurians are listed in a \"flora and fauna\" of the universe written by a Professor Thripthead under poisonous fungi.\n\nThe Uvodni is a bug-like race, first introduced in \"Warriors of Kudlak\" (2007). General Kudlak served in his race's military until injuries forced him to retire. In order to gain more troops for his race's continuing war effort, Kudlak was dispatched to Earth. He seized control of the Combat 3000 laser game franchise, which he secretly used to find human children with strong combat skills. These children were teleported to Kudlak's orbiting spaceship and dispatched to fight in his race's war. Kudlak took orders from a battle computer that used the image of a female of his race as an avatar, which he referred to as \"Mistress\". An error left the computer unable to comprehend the concept of the war ending, so it withheld from Kudlak an announcement of peace from his emperor for over a decade. When this fact was revealed, by intervention of Luke Smith's computer hacking, Kudlak destroyed the computer. He then dedicated his life to finding and returning the already dispatched human children, hoping to gain inner peace by doing so.\n\nAn Uvodni appeared in \"The Pandorica Opens\" (2010) as part of the Alliance formed to trap the Doctor.\n\nThe Uvodni are mentioned in the audio book \"The White Wolf\", when Ben remarks that the Uvodni could have helped them get home.\n\nThe Uvodni are mentioned in the audio book \"Wraith World\", when Clyde Langer remarks he cannot understand why Luke and Rani would want to read about made up adventures, when they have faced Uvodni.\n\nLiving metal created by the Time Lords, capable of many tasks due to its origins. Such metal ended up on Earth and Lady Peinforte used it to make a statue of herself, the Nemesis Statue. The Doctor, through his various incarnations, sent the statue off Earth every 25 years, only for it to return, due to the bow and arrow being missing and thus draw the statue back; every great disaster in Earth's history that's 25 years apart was caused by it.\n\nIn 1988, the Doctor was able to recover all the pieces and have the statue explode in the middle of a Cyberman fleet.\n\nA number of different types of vampire have appeared in televised Doctor Who:\n\nVampires have also appeared in \"Doctor Who\" stories in other media. Vampires related to the Great Vampires seen in \"State of Decay\" are featured prominently in the Virgin New Adventures novel \"Blood Harvest\", the Missing Adventure \"Goth Opera\", the BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures novel \"Vampire Science\", and the Big Finish Productions audio dramas \"Project: Twilight\" and \"Project: Lazarus\". The Eighth Doctor Adventure \"The Eight Doctors\" also features them in a flashback to \"State of Decay\"; in addition, the war between the vampires and the Time Lords is a significant plot element in the New Adventure \"Damaged Goods\". Other vampires or vampire-like creatures have been featured in the Missing Adventure \"Managra\", the audio drama \"\", the BBCi webcast \"Death Comes to Time\", the short story \"The Feast of the Stone\" (featuring an alternate Ninth Doctor), the \"Bernice Summerfield\" anthology \"The Vampire Curse\", and the \"Torchwood\" website.\n\nVampires also featured in the Big Finish Doctor Who 40th anniversary story \"Zagreus\". Here an account is given that the Vampires originally fed on mindless creatures they bred themselves, until the Time Lords attacking them forced them to feed on sentient species. It is also claimed here that Rassilon developed regeneration from the Vampires.\n\nThe Varga Plants (sometimes Vaarga) appeared in the First Doctor episode \"Mission to the Unknown\" and the serial \"The Daleks' Master Plan\" (1965–66), which were essentially a prologue and main epic respectively. They were created by Terry Nation.\n\nVarga Plants grew naturally on the Daleks' homeworld, Skaro, and when the Daleks set up a base on the planet Kembel they brought some Varga plants with them to act as sentries in the jungle surrounding their base. They were suited to this as they could move around freely by dragging themselves along with their roots.\n\nVarga plants resemble cacti; they are covered in fur and thorns. Anyone pricked by a Varga thorn will be consumed by the urge to kill, while simultaneously becoming a Varga plant themself. This grisly fate befell astronauts Jeff Garvey and Gordon Lowery, and their commander, Marc Cory, was forced to kill them.\n\nThe plants later made an appearance in the Big Finish audio \"\". In this, it was revealed that the Varga plants were one of the oldest species on Skaro, but for most of their history had been immobile. Since the start of the Kaled-Thal war however, exposure to radiation and chemical weapons had caused them to rapidly evolve into a much deadlier form, capable of self-locomotion. It was this discovery that caused Davros to become interested in genetically engineering creatures in order to create weapons of war. In \"\", they were found on a terraformed Jupiter where they infected earth troops. They appeared in \"\" where after the Time War they infested the ruined Dalek city of Kaalann on Skaro but here their appearance was much different.\n\nVarosians are the descendants of prisoners that were kept on the planet, though the truth of this has faded with time, with only a few knowing the truth.\n\nVashta Nerada (literally: the shadows that melt the flesh) are microscopic swarm creatures which, when present in a high enough concentration, are indistinguishable from shadows, and use this to their advantage in approaching and attacking prey. They are described as the \"piranhas of the air\", able to strip their victims to the bone in an instant in high enough densities. The Doctor says that almost every planet in the universe has some, including Earth, and claims that they can be seen as the specks of dust visible in bright light. He states they are the reason most sentient creatures have an instinctual fear of the dark. On most planets, however, Vashta Nerada exist in relatively low concentrations, feeding primarily on carrion, with attacks on people being comparatively rare. In the episode \"Silence in the Library\", an unusually high concentration of Vashta Nerada had completely overrun the 51st-century \"Library\", resulting in the apparent death of everyone inside at the time.\n\nVashta Nerada normally live in forested areas, and reproduce by means of microscopic spores which can lie dormant in wood pulp. In the episode \"Forest of the Dead\", this is revealed to be the reason for their unusual prevalence in The Library, as it is made known that the books and The Library itself was constructed of wood from the Vashta Nerada's native forest feeding grounds. Individually, Vashta Nerada are non-sentient, but if a large enough concentration come together, they can form a group mind of human-level intelligence capable of communication.\n\nThe fourth episode of \"\", \"Shadows of the Vashta Nerada\", features them as the leading villain when a temporal rift draws a swam of Vashta Nerada to an underwater base that is being visited by the Eleventh Doctor and Amy Pond.\n\nThe Vashta Nerada appear in the second volume of the Big Finish Productions audio \"\"; \"Night of the Vashta Nerada\" sees the Fourth Doctor visiting a theme park that has unleashed the local Vashta Nerada after the planet's forests were torn down to allow the park to be constructed, and \"Day of the Vashta Nerada\" pits the Eighth Doctor against genetically-altered Vashta Nerada that have been created as a new weapon in the Time War.\n\nVeils are able to step into the bodies of others, controlling them. They can also induce a trance by touching their victims. This can be done with their extremely long tongue. In the episode, \"Prisoner of the Judoon\", Androvax, the last Veil, was a fugitive responsible for destroying twelve planets, and was pursued by the Judoon after the Judoon prison ship containing him crashed on Earth. He then returned on the episode \"The Vault of Secrets\", seeking help from Sarah Jane, Clyde and Rani due to the fact that he was ill and wanted to return to his own kind. Androvax was successful in awakening the survivors of the Veils as he searches for a new world for them to reside in.\n\nIn \"Heaven Sent,\" the Twelfth Doctor encountered another creature that is also called the Veil while trapped in his Confession Dial. The creature modeled after an image of a rotting female corpse the Doctor saw in his childhood, the Veil's purpose is to force the Doctor to confess what he knew of the Hybrid.\n\nVenusians are inhabitants of the planet Venus, the closest planet to Earth. They had large feet, and six arms. The Third Doctor often employed a form of Venusian martial art (called Venusian aikido or Venusian karate) and sang Venusian lullabies (to the tune of \"God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen\"). Venusian aikido is allegedly very hard for two-armed beings to learn. Its use appeared in the serials Inferno, Day of the Daleks, and others. The Seventh Doctor favored a more subtle version which involved applying a single finger, seen in \"Survival.\" The Fourth Doctor revealed to Davros in \"Genesis of the Daleks\" that a battle between the Venusians and the Daleks \"in the Space Year 17,000\" was ended by the intervention of a group of battleships from the planet Hyperon. Although Venus today is utterly devoid of life, the Virgin Missing Adventures novel \"Venusian Lullaby\" shows Venus to have been inhabited billions of years ago, before the surface became too hot to support life.\n\nArtificially created plant-based humanoids who possess problem-solving intelligence and the power of speech; they were intended to perform tasks usually carried out by robots, but for a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately they instead decided to eradicate all of 'animalkind'. Vervoids had about the size and strength of humans, but were covered in leaves which provided them with energy through photosynthesis. They possessed thorns so poisonous they could kill a human on contact, and could produce copious amounts of methane-based swamp gas.\n\nThe Vespiform are an insectoid species resembling giant wasps, born \"en masse\" in hives in the Silfrax Galaxy. Each possesses the ability to morph into other species. It also has the ability to breed with other species, including humans, to produce offspring. The \"Monster Files\" feature establishes them as an ancient race and that they have fought the Quark rebels.\n\nVespiform have a telepathic connection to objects called firestones, which contains part of their mind. Like Earth's wasps, the Vespiform are vulnerable to water. A Vespiform-human hybrid can live a normal life as a human until a burst of intense emotion awakens its alien biology. When the Vespiform morphs into another species it emits a purple light.\n\nIn \"The Unicorn and the Wasp\", a Vespiform appears and goes on a killing spree in the style of Agatha Christie's murder mystery books. Eventually it turns out the reason for Vespiform's killings was due to his firestone in the possession of Lady Eddison, who was thinking about Christie's novels. Furthermore, the Vespiform is revealed to be Lady Eddison's illegitimate son: Reverend Golightly. In the end, trying to get the firestone back, the Vespiform dies chasing after the item when Donna Noble throws it into a lake.\n\nThe Vinvocci are a race of spiky green aliens who first appeared in \"The End of Time\". A pair of Vinvocci came to Earth as part of a salvage operation to recover Vinvocci technology—a medical device for healing entire planets, which Joshua Naismith named the \"Immortality Gate\". They possess disguise technology referred to by the Doctor as a Shimmer. When the Doctor notes a similarity to Bannakaffalatta from \"Voyage of the Damned\", noting the distinction that \"he was small, and red\", the Vinvocci are quick to differentiate themselves from the Zocci; both races may be at odds with each, explaining the response. They also find it racist when someone calls them cacti.\n\nInsectoid creatures that attempted to destroy Earth in 1958, in the Dry Springs of Nevada.\n\nVisians are invisible creatures indigenous to the planet Mira. They are completely invisible, detectable only by their footprints and the sounds they make while moving through the jungle. The Doctor states that they are 8 feet tall and extremely hostile, evidenced by the fact that they attack both the Doctor's party and the Daleks indiscriminately.\n\nA highly advanced race of creatures which specialise in virus experimentation. They have featured in the Fifth Doctor Audio Story Mission of the Viyrans and the Sixth Doctor Audio Stories Patient Zero and Blue Forgotten Planet. They also appeared in Dark Eyes 2.\n\nThe natives of the planet Voga, where it was entirely made of gold. The Cybermen sought to destroy their planet, to hinder the organics' ability to combat them in the Cyber Wars.\n\nA race of amphibious humanoids introduced in the First Doctor serial \"The Keys of Marinus\" (1964).\n\nA race mentioned in \"Carnival of Monsters\", known for their gambling.\n\nTwo different kinds of werewolves have appeared in Doctor Who during the series' 50-year run. In The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, a woman named Mag had been found by a blowhard explorer on one of his trips; Mag became feral and changed slightly into a more animalistic appearance in moonlight, simulated or real. The Seventh Doctor was able to encourage Mag to regain control of herself, something she wondered she would be able to do again.\n\nIn Tooth and Claw, a bacterial life form was worshiped by a religious order, and wanted to establish the Empire of the Wolf by infecting Queen Victoria. The Tenth Doctor was able to destroy it and its host by overloading it with moonlight. However, he suspected that a tiny bit of the lifeform was able to sneak into the Queen through a cut on her finger; the Doctor guessed that the lifeform wouldn't pose a threat until the 21st century.\n\nThe Whisper Men are faceless beings who serve the Great Intelligence. They dress in Victorian attire and speak in rhyming whispers. Their faces are blank and white except for a mouth full of sharp teeth, and their hands can phase through a person's chest and stop their hearts at will. When the Great Intelligence inhabits one of the Whisper Men, it takes the form of Walter Simeon. The Whisper Men all vanish from existence when the Great Intelligence willingly destroys itself by scattering itself throughout the Doctor's timeline at Trenzalore, the Doctor's final resting place.\n\nThe Wirrn are an insectoid race that made their debut in the 1975 Fourth Doctor story \"The Ark in Space\". The name is sometimes spelled Wirrrn, which is a spelling originating from the novelisation of the story.\n\nThe Wirrn claim to have originated from Andromeda (whether they meant the galaxy, the constellation, or even a planet named \"Andromeda\" is unclear), but were driven into space by human settlers. They are slightly larger than humans, dark green and wasp-like in appearance, and live mostly in space, although their breeding colonies are terrestrial. Their bodies are a self-contained system, their lungs being able to recycle waste carbon dioxide and only needing to touch down occasionally on planetary bodies for food and oxygen. The Wirrn's life cycle involves laying their eggs in living hosts; the larvae emerge to consume the host, absorbing its memories and knowledge. A Wirrn larva is a green slug-like creature, varying in size from a few inches to 1 or 2 metres across. It can \"infect\" another organism through contact with a substance it excretes, mutating them into an adult Wirrn and connecting their consciousness to the hive mind.\n\nIn \"The Ark in Space\", the Wirrn found Space Station Nerva in orbit around an Earth devastated centuries before by solar flares. The survivors had lain in suspended animation waiting for the planet to recover, but had overslept by several millennia. The Wirrn intended to use the sleepers as a food source and claim the empty Earth for their own, as both a means of survival and an act of revenge against the human race for taking their former territories. In the course of their plan, Noah, leader of Nerva, was infected and converted to their kind. However, Noah still retained \"more than a vestige of human spirit\", probably thanks to the encouragements of the Doctor, and led the Wirrn into Nerva's transport ship even though he knew it was rigged to explode. It did so, ending the Wirrn threat.\n\nThe Wirrn have also appeared in the Eighth Doctor Adventures novel \"Placebo Effect\" by Gary Russell, and in the audio play \"Wirrn: Race Memory\", produced by BBV. Big Finish used them in the audio stories \"Wirrn Dawn\" with the Eighth Doctor and \"Wirrn Isle\" with the Sixth. A dead Wirrn appears briefly in television story \"The Stones of Blood\".\n\nAn alien species, which resemble giant scorpions; they appear in the novel \"The Crawling Terror\". According to the Twelfth Doctor, the Wyrresters are warmongers that have ravaged their entire star system; their venom has a hypnotic suggestion effect. Attempting to depart from their star system once it was out of habitable planets, the Wyrresters sent out a message in the 1940s, which was picked up by the Germans and the Allied Forces; the message contained instructions on how to build a teleportation device. Hitler believed it was a super weapon gifted to him by the heavens, but the British scientists knew better. Though the Doctor attempted to stop the experiment, a Wyrrester got through and stung a scientist before being slain by a bombing; this resulted in 70 years of experimentation trying to bring the minds of the Wyrresters to Earth via inhabiting mutated insect bodies. The Doctor's past self arrived to discover the situation, and time traveled to discover what had happened. With the aid of the local military, the Doctor was able to prevent the Wyrresters from teleporting by destroying the device.\n\nThe Xeraphin were an ancient species encountered by the Fifth Doctor in the story \"Time-Flight\" (1982) by Peter Grimwade. Originating from the planet Xeriphas, they possessed immense psychokinetic and scientific powers. The Doctor believed the race to have been wiped out during the crossfire during the Vardon/Kosnax war. Instead, the entire race fled to Earth in an escaping spacecraft. The ship crashed near present-day Heathrow some 140 million years ago. When the Xeraphin emerged they built a Citadel to mark their new home but the Xeraphin were so plagued with radiation that they abandoned their original humanoid bodies and transformed into a single bioplasmic gestalt intelligence within a sarcophagus at the heart of the Citadel.\n\nThe arrival of the Master coincided with their emergence from the gestalt state when the radiation effects had subsided, and his influence caused the emergence of a split personality of good and evil, each side competing for their tremendous power while yearning to become a proper species once again. The Master, who was stranded on Earth at the time too, succeeded in capturing the Xeraphin as a new power source for his TARDIS. However, the Doctor's intervention meant his nemesis' TARDIS was sent to Xeriphas where events became out of his control.\n\nBefore fleeing Xeriphas and the Xeraphin, the Master took with him Kamelion, a Xeraphin war weapon with advanced shape-changing abilities dependent on the will of its controller. Kamelion was freed from the Master and joined the Doctor's TARDIS crew in \"The King's Demons\" (1983).\n\nXyloks are a crystalline race that crashed into Earth as a meteorite about 60 million years ago. Consequently, the Xyloks that survived the crash were trapped beneath the surface of the Earth, regrowing over thousands of millennia.\n\nAfter the eruption of mount Krakatoa in 1883, one of the Xyloks was found in the post-volcanic aftermath. It was eventually passed to Sarah Jane Smith by a geologist friend when she was researching volcanic activity, 18 months prior to the events of \"The Lost Boy\". During her studies of the crystalline structure, she found that it could use her laptop to communicate. The Xylok agreed to help Sarah Jane protect Earth, and was integrated into the supercomputer Mr Smith, built by Sarah Jane under the instruction of the Xylok. Unbeknownst to Sarah Jane, this was a plot, in anticipation that it would one day be able to release the imprisoned Xylok race. Sarah Jane and her companions were able to thwart its intentions; as a result, Mr Smith was reprogrammed and became a benefit to the human race once again.\n\nThe Zaralok was a shark-like creature that prowled the waters around the flooded 23rd-century London, now little more than a network of underwater tunnels codenamed 'Poseidon'. When the Doctor and Amy land the TARDIS in Poseidon, the Zaralok immediately attacks, attempting to ram its way into the glass tunnels. While constantly having to evade the monster, the two slowly unravell the mystery of Poseidon, which has fallen under threat from not only the Zaralok, but also the Vashta Nerada and otherworldly radiation. They eventually discover that all the anomalies arrived at the city when the USS Eldridge, an American WWII-era ship which had vanished through a wormhole to another world hundreds of years ago, suddenly jumped back through into the sea several days ago. However, the ship became lodged in the wormhole and held it open, allowing the creatures and the radiation to seep through. The Doctor and Amy travel to the wreckage of the Eldridge and are able to close the wormhole; the Zaralok is seen being dragged back to its own world, while the other anomalies disappear with it. The name of the creature is probably derived from \"Žralok\", a shark in Slovak or Czech language.\n\nThe Zarbi appeared in the 1965 First Doctor story \"The Web Planet\" written by Bill Strutton, and are an ant-like insectoid species, with some characteristics associated with beetles, from the planet Vortis, which were controlled by the power of the Animus. They are roughly eight feet long, and the Menoptra claim that they are \"little more than cattle\".\n\nThey possess little intelligence but were not at all aggressive until the Animus arrived. They were enslaved to the alien consciousness and considered the butterfly-like Menoptra their mortal enemies. Only they could control the woodlouse-like venom grubs, also known as larvae guns.\n\nThey returned to their normal ways after the Animus was defeated by the First Doctor, Ian Chesterton, Barbara Wright and Vicki. It is presumed that the various species on Vortis are now living peacefully together.\n\nA Zarbi and a Menoptra were shown on cover of the first edition of \"Doctor Who Annual\" in September 1965 along with two other \"Doctor Who\" alien races, a Voord and a Sensorite.\n\nThe Zocci are a diminutive race of red spiked aliens. \"Voyage of the Damned\" featured a Zocci named Bannakaffalatta. His species was first named in \"The End of Time\", where the Vinvocci are quick to differentiate themselves from the Zocci.\n\nA race of intelligent cacti from the planet Zolfa-Thura. Meglos, from the episode of the same name, was the last surviving member of the species.\n\n\n"}

Since the convention became effective in Poland on 22 March 1978, the designation of Wetland of International Importance has been applied to thirteen locations in the country, which combine to form an area of .\n\nThe site consists of a series of temperate zone forested and non-forested bogs that provide a variety of habitats for birds, mammals, fish and plants. The available habitats are ecologically typical of a riparian area including swamps and tussocks separated from cultivated areas by black alder () and white willow () forested areas.\n\nThe site is a shallow, overgrown lake in the Vistula Delta near the Baltic Sea coast that was once part of the Vistula Lagoon. The lake itself holds a variety of hydrophilic plants, including an array of nymphaeaceae, and is surrounded by marshes dominated by common reed beds () that transition into wooded wetlands of black alder ().\n\nThe site is a large, shallow glacial lake typical of those located in the Masurian Lake District. The littoral zone surrounding the lake provides significant opportunities for wetland bird breeding habitats in the extensive reed beds, bogs and in the surrounding wetland forests.\n\nThe site consists of three subalpine zone bogs along the Czech border, in the Karkonosze Mountains. The bogs are located at the watershed dividing the Baltic Sea and North Sea basins.\nThe bogs themselves support an extensive algal community while the surrounding area consists of dwarf Mountain pine () and low-growth vegetation.\n\nThe site is a glacial lake typical of those located in the Masurian Lake District with an area of , and a maximum depth of . The lake is connected with nearby Sniardwy Lake by a channel. The site is a breeding ground for water birds such as grebe, water rail (), moorhen, grey heron (), bearded reedling (), white-tailed eagle (), osprey (), rust-coloured kite, cormorant and black tern (). The lake has been a protected location since 1937 as a habitat of the mute swan (), every year there are a dozen to tens of dozens of nesting pairs, and during moulting they arrive in numbers reaching up to 2,000 birds.\n\nThe site, located within Barycz Valley Landscape Park, consists of various small ponds in the Barycz River valley with a total area of about . The ponds are surrounded by forests, meadows and cultivated areas. The ponds provide important spring and autumn migration habitat for a variety of geese, ducks and other waterbirds.\n\nThe site is a section of the Narew River. It is a swampy valley with moraine hills typical of a braided river. Depending on the season and the level of the water table, several riparian area ecosystems are available including swamps, tussocks with surrounding black alder () and white willow () forested areas.\n\nThe site comprises a vast open lowland landscape with a mosaic of swamps, moors, lakes, rivers and forests located between the basins of the Bug and Wieprz rivers. The site is part of the European Ecological Corridor of the Bug River. The location supports bird species including raptors such as lesser spotted eagle (), hen harrier () and Montagu's harrier () and birds such as aquatic warbler (), marsh sandpiper () and Eurasian cranes (). The area is considered to be an important crossing point for migratory birds. The north-south flyways and east-west flyways of birds meet in the region.

{"id": "1092282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1092282", "title": "Negative frequency", "text": "Negative frequency\n\nThe concept of negative and positive frequency can be as simple as a wheel rotating one way or the other way: a \"signed value\" of frequency can indicate both the rate and direction of rotation. The rate is expressed in units such as revolutions (a.k.a. \"cycles\") per second (hertz) or radian/second (where 1 cycle corresponds to 2\"π\" radians).\n\nLet \"ω\" be a nonnegative parameter with units of radians/sec. Then the angular function (angle vs. time) , has slope −\"ω\", which is called a negative frequency. But when the function is used as the argument of a cosine operator, the result is indistinguishable from .  Similarly, is indistinguishable from . Thus any sinusoids can be represented in terms of positive frequencies. The sign of the underlying phase slope is ambiguous.\n\nThe ambiguity is resolved when the cosine and sine operators can be observed simultaneously, because leads by 1/4 cycle (= \"π\"/2 radians) when , and lags by 1/4 cycle when .  Similarly, a vector, , rotates counter-clockwise at 1 radian/sec, and completes a circle every 2π seconds, and the vector rotates in the other direction.\n\nThe sign of \"ω\" is also preserved in the complex-valued function:\n\nsince R(\"t\") and I(\"t\") can be separately extracted and compared. Although formula_1  clearly contains more information than either of its components, a common interpretation is that it is a simpler function, because:\nwhich gives rise to the interpretation that cos(\"ωt\") comprises \"both\" positive and negative frequencies.  But the sum is actually a cancellation that contains less, not more, information. Any measure that indicates both frequencies includes a false positive, because \"ω\" can have only one sign.  The Fourier transform, for instance, merely tells us that cos(\"ωt\") correlates equally well with both and with .\n\nPerhaps the most well-known application of negative frequency is the calculation:\n\nwhich is a measure of the amount of frequency ω in the function \"x\"(\"t\") over the interval . When evaluated as a continuous function of \"ω\" for the theoretical interval , it is known as the Fourier transform of \"x\"(\"t\"). A brief explanation is that the product of two complex sinusoids is also a complex sinusoid whose frequency is the sum of the original frequencies. So when \"ω\" is positive, formula_4 causes all the frequencies of \"x\"(\"t\") to be reduced by amount \"ω\". Whatever part of \"x\"(\"t\") that was at frequency \"ω\" is changed to frequency zero, which is just a constant whose amplitude level is a measure of the strength of the original \"ω\" content. And whatever part of \"x\"(\"t\") that was at frequency zero is changed to a sinusoid at frequency −\"ω\". Similarly, all other frequencies are changed to non-zero values. As the interval increases, the contribution of the constant term grows in proportion. But the contributions of the sinusoidal terms only oscillate around zero. So \"X\"(\"ω\") improves as a relative measure of the amount of frequency \"ω\" in the function \"x\"(\"t\").\n\nThe Fourier transform of  formula_1  produces a non-zero response only at frequency \"ω\". The transform of formula_2 has responses at both \"ω\" and −\"ω\", as anticipated by .\n\n"}
{"id": "16940886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16940886", "title": "Nuclear power in the European Union", "text": "Nuclear power in the European Union\n\nNuclear power in the European Union accounted for approximately 15% of total energy consumption in 2005. The energy policies of the European Union (EU) member countries vary significantly. As of January 2010, 14 out of 27 countries have nuclear reactors. The countries with reactors are: Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\n\nStress tests were developed within the EU in the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, with the goal of making all 132 operating European reactors follow the same safety standards and have the same safety level for a list of possible catastrophical events (e.g. earthquake, flooding or plane crash). Most reactors proved well during the tests, with just 4 reactors in 2 countries having less than one hour for reactivating safety systems; however, most reactors will also have to undergo a program of safety upgrades. In 2012, the costs of additional safety improvements were estimated to be in the range of €30 million to €200 million per reactor unit. Thus, the total costs for the 132 reactors operating in the EU could be in the order of €10–25 billion for all NPP units in the EU over the coming years.\n\nThe EU-27 in 2005 satisfied its primary energy consumption with 36.7% oil, 24.6% gas, 17.7% coal, 14.2% nuclear, 6.7% renewables and 0.1% industrial waste. In 2006, nuclear energy provided the largest source (29.5%) of electricity with a production of 990 TWh, and an installed capacity of 134 GWe (17.6% of all installed capacity). It was the leading electric power source in Belgium, France, Hungary, Lithuania and Slovakia. France, where nuclear is also the largest \"primary\" energy source, produced 450 TWh in 2006 – 45% of the EU's total. Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Austria, Poland and Portugal did not produce any nuclear energy. As of June 2013 there are 131 nuclear reactors in the European Union. 112 units of these are located in eight of the western EU countries. Total nuclear energy generation from EU power plants increased by 25% from 1995 to 2005. The majority of this growth occurred in the 1990s. Installed capacities decreased by 2.6% since 1990 and relative contribution to the overall electricity mix decreased from 30.8% in 1990 to 30.2% in 2005.\n\nIn 2009, only 3% of the uranium used in European nuclear reactors was mined in Europe. Australia, Russia, Canada and Niger were the largest suppliers of nuclear materials to the EU, supplying more than 70% of the total needs in 2009\n\nEuropean nuclear policy is governed by the Euratom Treaty. Therefore, regular EU policy on for example environment or the market does not apply to issues in the nuclear field. Nuclear policy is mainly in the competence of the member states. In the EU level, DG ENER is the main authority for EU nuclear issues.\n\nThe European Council is the locus for intergovernmental decisions. The European Parliament does not have authority in the field of nuclear policy other than the right to ask questions to the European Commission.\n\nIn case of a radiological emergency, the EU will trigger its ECURIE alert system, which immediately notifies all national authorities of an impending nuclear hazard. This system was installed after the experience with the Chernobyl disaster.\n\nThe Commission's SET plan mentions the \"sustainable nuclear fission initiative\" to develop Generation IV reactors as one of the research priorities of the European Union.\n\nThe European Commission is proposing a stress test for all nuclear power plants in Europe, to prove the nuclear fleet can withstand incidents like those in Fukushima. The European Commission is also proposing tests for countries near the EU that make use of nuclear power.\n\nOn average, the EU creates about 40,000 cubic meters of radioactive waste per year. Eighty percent of that is short-lived low-level radioactive waste. France and the United Kingdom are currently the only EU countries that reprocess waste. However, the reprocessing of spent fuel in the UK is being phased out but is expected to continue in France. The countries that currently use this reprocessed fuel (MOX) include Germany, Belgium, France and Switzerland. Reprocessing spent fuel significantly decreases its volume and extracts plutonium from it. Although plutonium is commonly associated with nuclear weapons, the plutonium extracted with reprocessing is not suitable for 'classic' nuclear weapons.\n\nThe EBRD is financing the decommissioning of old nuclear plants in Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia.\n\nEU memberstates Austria, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Italy, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovenia are working since January 2009 together in the European Repository Development Organisation (ERDO) to address common issues on nuclear waste storage.\n\nERDO was working early 2010 on a plan to store European nuclear waste somewhere in eastern Europe.\n\n\"Some 7,000 cubic meters of high-level nuclear waste are produced across the EU each year. Most Member States store spent fuel and other highly radioactive wastes in above-ground storage facilities that need continuous maintenance and oversight and are at risk of accidents, such as airplane crashes, fires or earthquakes. Hungary and Bulgaria currently ship nuclear waste to Russia.\"\n\nOn 19 July 2011, the European Commission adopted a Directive for regulating and handling nuclear waste in the EU.\n\"Exports to countries outside the EU is allowed under very strict and binding conditions: The third country needs to have a final repository in operation, when the waste is being shipped. Such a repository for highly radioactive waste is internationally defined to be a deep geological repository. At present, such deep geological repositories do not exist anywhere in the world nor is a repository in construction outside of the EU. It takes currently a minimum of 40 years to develop and build one.\"\n\nThe MAX project (2011 to August 2014), funded partly with an almost €3 million European Commission contribution, embodied working on transmuting the waste into less toxic shorter-lived elements. The final report from August 2014 is available. It concludes that one milestone was not achieved.\n\nBy 2025, it is estimated that over a third of the EU's currently operational reactors will be at the end of their lifecycle and in need of shutdown. At the time of the accession to the EU, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia agreed to shut down reactors at the sites of Kozloduy, Ignalina and Bohunice respectively: these programs are currently under way. Other decommissioning activities are under way for older reactors, phased out for political reasons (e.g. Italy, Germany) or simply because they reached their end-of-life (e.g. United Kingdom).\n\nIn 2016, Reuters reported that the European Commission estimated that the EU's nuclear decommissioning liabilities were seriously underfunded by about 118 billion euros, with only 150 billion euros of earmarked assets to cover 268 billion euros of expected decommissioning costs covering both dismantling of nuclear plants and storage of radioactive parts and waste. Among EU member states still operating nuclear plants, only Britain's operators have enough dedicated assets to cover the expected costs, 63 billion euros, the Commission's draft working paper finds. France had the largest shortfall with only 23 billion euros of earmarked assets to cover 74 billion euros of expected costs, while a stress test carried out by Germany’s Economy Ministry late last year showed the provisions made by the country’s utilities – E.ON, RWE, EnBW and Vattenfall [VATN.UL] – were adequate. Decommissioning costs vary according to reactor type and size, location, the proximity and availability of disposal facilities, the intended future use of the site and the condition of the reactor at the time of decommissioning. Although decommissioning might gradually become cheaper, the cost of final waste depositories is largely unknown and costs could also grow, rather than shrink, over the many decades in question. The European Commission declined to comment on an unpublished document and has not confirmed when the report will be officially published.\n\nAdvanced new reactors under construction in Finland and France, which were meant to lead a nuclear renaissance, have been delayed and are running over-budget. There has been a 15-year gap in building reactors, which has meant that there are difficulties in manufacturing the high quality parts required for a reactor. The new reactor also represents an advance over existing technologies, with better reliability and safety over Generation II reactors. Finally, they are \"first-of-a-kind\" industrial plants, having then all the kinds of problems and delays that should be avoided in following projects.\n\nThe European nuclear industry is working to develop Generation IV nuclear reactors. Foratom is a Brussels-based trade organisation that bills itself as the \"voice of the nuclear industry\".\n\nAlong with companies and trade organisations like Foratom, General Electric, Hitachi, and Toshiba are all partners in the European Nuclear Industry. Other partners may include TEPCO from Japan and KEPCO from South Korea. The nuclear industry is regulated by governments and financing is often provided to private contractors who do the work.\n\nNuclear Safety is an ongoing discussion in the EU. The Western European Nuclear Regulators Association has members from 17 states or European countries. Nuclear safety faces many challenges. WENR addresses these challenges and commits itself to objective reporting. An example of a report is the publication, \"Stress Test\" specifications, Proposal by the WENRA Task Force, 21 April 2011.\n\nCurrently, eight European countries are building new reactors, or seriously planning to build new ones:\n\nSlovenian plans to expand Krško plant seem to have been dropped, instead a 20 years life extension is under evaluation. EPR new reactors under construction in Finland and France have been delayed and are running over-budget. Similar problems are for new VVR reactors under construction in Mochovce, Slovakia, which are anyway closing to completion.\n\nPower companies are building nuclear reactors in Finland and France and the French state continues to fund nuclear power, with a €1 billion added to help research for fourth-generation technology and nuclear safety.\n\nSeveral countries, among the ones owning nuclear power plants, have anyway expanded their nuclear power generation capacity by just upgrading existing reactors. Such upgrades granted from 10% to 29% more power per unit.\n\nFollowing the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany has permanently shut down eight of its reactors and pledged to close the rest by 2022; but difficulties, costs and subsequent critics of planned energy transition could potentially harm this policy. Italy voted twice, in 1987 to make more difficult to build new plants (the vote was extensively interpreted by following governments as a total repeal of nuclear power plants, leading to the sudden shut down of all Italian operating reactors within few years), and in 2011 to keep their country non-nuclear. Switzerland and Spain have banned the construction of new reactors. Belgium is considering phasing out its nuclear plants. France, frequently heralded as a nuclear commercial model for the world, was as of 2011 locked in a national debate over a partial nuclear phase-out. In the same time, however, Sweden embraced a nuclear phase-out policy as early as 1980, so preceding all these countries; but only the two oldest reactors, of twelve, were shut down at their end of life; while in 2010 Swedish Parliament repealed this policy.\nAs said, the 2011 Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster has led some European energy officials to re-think about nuclear power generation, above all in Germany and Switzerland. Switzerland has abandoned plans to replace its old nuclear reactors and will take the last one offline in 2034. Anti-nuclear opposition intensified in Germany. In the following months the government decided to shut down eight reactors immediately (6 August 2011) and to have the other nine off the grid by the end of 2022. Renewable energy in Germany is believed to be able to compensate for much of the loss. In September 2011 Siemens, which had been responsible for constructing all 17 of Germany's existing nuclear power plants, announced that it would exit the nuclear sector following the Fukushima disaster and the subsequent changes to German energy policy. Chief executive Peter Loescher has supported the German government's planned \"Energiewende\", its transition to renewable energy technologies, calling it a \"project of the century\" and saying Berlin's target of reaching 35% renewable energy sources by 2020 was feasible. Despite this, the phasing out of nuclear energy seems to be much more difficult and costly than expected. The transition is tending more towards polluting fossil fuel plants than clean renewable energies, sparking several critics. Actually, transition plans did not meet their short-term goals and will hardly meet their medium-term goals; fossil fuel prices and technology are still more efficient, cheaper and easier to implement than heavily state-subsidised solar and wind power generation.\n"}

The United States National Hurricane Center defines rapid intensification as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least in a 24-hour period.\n\nIn order for rapid intensification to occur, several conditions must be in place. Water temperatures must be extremely warm (near or above 30 °C, 86 °F), and water of this temperature must be sufficiently deep such that waves do not churn deeper cooler waters up to the surface. Wind shear must be low; when wind shear is high, the convection and circulation in the cyclone will be disrupted. Dry air can also limit the strengthening of tropical cyclones.\n\nUsually, an anticyclone in the upper layers of the troposphere above the storm must be present as well—for extremely low surface pressures to develop, air must be rising very rapidly in the eyewall of the storm, and an upper-level anticyclone helps channel this air away from the cyclone efficiently. Hot towers have been implicated in tropical cyclone rapid intensification, though they have diagnostically seen varied impacts across basins.\n\nThe United States National Hurricane Center previously defined rapid deepening of a tropical cyclone, when the minimum central pressure decreased by over a 24-hour period.<ref name=\"NHC/TPC glossary\"></ref> However it is now defined as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least in a 24-hour period.\n\n"}

It is the only swamp forest located in Bangladesh and one of the few freshwater swamp forest in the world. The forest is naturally conserved under the Department of Forestry, Govt. of Bangladesh.\n\nIts area is 3, 325.61 acre including 504 acre declared as the animal sanctuary in 2015. It is known as the Amazon of Bangla and Sundarbans of Sylhet. This only swamp forest in Bangladesh is located 26 km far from Sylhet. The forest's name comes from the word, \"Rata\" or \"Pati\" tree, used by the locals of Sylhet.\n\nThe evergreen forest is situated by the river \"Goain\" and linked with the channel \"Chengir Khal\". Most of the trees growing here are the Millettia pinnata (করচ গাছ \"Koroch tree\"). The forest is submerged under 20–30 feet water in the rainy season. For the rest of the year, the water level is about 10 feet deep.\n\nRatargul is about 26 kilometres from Sylhet. There is a 3,325 acres wetland in Sylhet range-2 under the forest department and in that wetland Ratargul swamp forest is about 504 acres. It is located in Gowainghat. After reaching Gowainghat, tourists reserve local engine boat namely \"traller\" to reach forest. There are two haors namely \"shimul bil haor\" and \"neoa bil haor\" in the south part of the forest.\n\nTropical air from the north-west of Sylhet causes heavy rainfall. According to Sylhet Weather Centre, average rainfall is 4162 millimetre per year. Highest rainfall occurs in July which is 1250 millimetre. On the other hand, December is the driest season with 74% relative density which jumps up to more than 90% in July–August. The forest is linked with Gowain river through a lake namely \"chengir khal\". In the rainy season, too much water from India enter into the lake through Gowain river and the forest become flooded. This situation prevails from May to early October and the temperature remains 32-degree Celsius which drops to 12-degree Celsius in January. In the rainy season, trees remain 10 ft (somewhere even 15–20 ft) under water but the forest become dry in winter season.\n\n73 species of plants could be found in the forest till now. 80 percent of the forest area is covered with umbrella of the trees.\n\nTwo layer of plants can be seen in the swamp forest. The upper layer consists of trees and the lower one consists of intense Schumannianthus dichotomus. The canopy of the plants spreads up to 15 meters of height.\n\nThough the forest is natural, the Forestry Department of Bangladesh has planted some watery plants like Calamus tenuis, Burflower Tree, Barringtonia acutangula, Calamus tenuis. Banyan Tree is very common in the forest. Besides that, Barringtonia acutangula, Milletia Pinnata, Sacred Garlic Pear or Temple Plant, Alstonia Scholaris can also be seen.\n\nSnake and worm snake can widely be seen in this water-drowned forest. Mongoose can be seen in dry season. Monkey and Water Monitor also resides in the forest. Heron, Egret, Kingfisher, Parrot, Bulbul, Swan, Dove, Water fowl, Eagle and Kite Bird are some of the birds of the swamp forest. Cotton Pygmy Goose and other Migratory birds and Vulture visit the forest in winter. Name of some local fishes available in the forest are Batasio, Rita, Pabda, Rohu etc.\n\nTourists mostly go to see the forest in monsoon. One needs to take permission from the forest office to visit the forest. A local boat needs to be hired to travel through the swamp forest.There is a building tower inside the forest.If you go up there,you can see the whole view of the forest.\n\n"}

It is caused by the longitudinal drift of energetic (10–200 keV) particles.\n\nEarth's ring current is responsible for shielding the lower latitudes of the Earth from magnetospheric electric fields. It therefore has a large effect on the electrodynamics of geomagnetic storms. The ring current system consists of a band, at a distance of 3 to 8 \"R\", which lies in the equatorial plane and circulates clockwise around the Earth (when viewed from the north). The particles of this region produce a magnetic field in opposition to the Earth's magnetic field and so an Earthly observer would observe a decrease in the magnetic field in this area. The negative deflection of the Earth's magnetic field due to the ring current is measured by the Dst index.\n\nThe ring current energy is mainly carried around by the ions, most of which are protons. However, one also sees alpha particles in the ring current, a type of ion that is plentiful in the solar wind. In addition, a certain percentage are O oxygen ions, similar to those in the ionosphere of Earth, though much more energetic. This mixture of ions suggests that ring current particles probably come from more than one source.\n\nDuring a geomagnetic storm, the number of particles in the ring current will increase. As a result, there is a decrease in the effects of geomagnetic field.\n\n"}

Founded in 1998, Rise Against Hunger mobilizes more than 350,000 volunteers each year to package meals for people in need around the globe. Since 2005, Rise Against Hunger has distributed more than 315,000,000 meals to recipients in 74 countries with a mission to end hunger in our lifetime.\n\nRise Against Hunger is an international hunger relief agency that seeks to end global hunger by engaging local volunteers. The organization was formed in 1998 by Ray Buchanan, a United Methodist Minister, and began its meal packaging program in 2005. The organizational mission is stated as \"Rise Against Hunger is driven by the vision of a world without hunger. Its mission is to end hunger in our lifetime by providing food and life-changing aid to the world’s most vulnerable and creating a global commitment to mobilize the necessary resources.\"\n\nRise Against Hunger aims to end hunger through four pathways: Nourishing Lives, Responding to Emergencies, Empowering Communities and Growing the Movement. From the implementation of sustainable development community projects to the meal packaging program that utilizes local volunteers, Rise Against Hunger strives to make a global impact on hunger by building resilience, self-sufficiency and empowerment among the world’s most vulnerable populations. \n\nRise Against Hunger supports safety net programs that support nourishment and skills trainings that help the world’s most vulnerable navigate the difficult journey out of poverty. Rise Against Hunger partners with schools in order to promote and incentivize increased attendance. Additionally, Rise Against Hunger works to partner with skills trainings and clinics in order to support adults learning new trades and encourage healthy lifestyles. Rise Against Hunger works to nourish lives through a holistic approach in the development of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nRise Against Hunger responds to emergencies. In times of floods, droughts or political unrest, to name a few, Rise Against Hunger aims to provide the immediate critical need, food. Access to food, wages and market systems are often destroyed in times of emergency. Rise Against Hunger works with its in-country partner organizations in order to address the immediate needs in the wake of crisis. Each year Rise Against Hunger reserves 10% of its projected meals to respond to crisis situations. Official Rise Against Hunger responses include the 2016 Hurricane Matthew, Syrian conflict, South Sudanese conflict and 2010 Haiti earthquake.\n\nIn order to create long-term solutions to hunger and poverty, Rise Against Hunger works to empower communities through agricultural and income-generating initiatives. Rise Against Hunger works to increase agriculture production and incomes through programs that promote improved agricultural methods, business skills and market access. Farmers, one of the most food insecure populations in the world, are given access to quality seeds and fertilizers to increase agricultural production and diversify their crops. Rise Against Hunger supports vocational training to help at-risk individuals increase their earning potentials and gain consistent access to food.\n\nPart of Rise Against Hunger’s mission is to create a global commitment to mobilize the necessary resources to end hunger. Rise Against Hunger works with volunteer groups from communities of faith, corporations, schools and civic clubs to package meals while developing a greater awareness of hunger-related issues. Additionally, Rise Against Hunger engages its supporters to participate in advocacy activities to work toward changing laws, policies, systems and attitudes to end hunger by 2030.\n\nThe assembly process combines rice, soy, dehydrated vegetables and a micronutrient flavoring mix formulated by Kraft Heinz Company Foundation that includes 23 essential vitamins and minerals. The cost of each meal varies between 29 and 34 cents. The food has a shelf-life of two years.\nRise Against Hunger provides over 70% of its meals to support transformational development programs such as school lunch programs, vocational training programs, early childhood development programs, orphanages, and medical clinics. Working with these programs helps enhance lives by giving beneficiaries the opportunity to break the cycle of poverty through education, skills development, and healthcare while also receiving much needed nutrition.\n\nRise Against Hunger supports partner organizations in developing countries by providing direct financial assistance to support ongoing programs that provide food, medicines or other basic necessities to impoverished populations. This program enables Rise Against Hunger to respond to crises immediately by working with organizations already on the ground. It also supports local economies in developing areas and promotes self-reliance.\n\n"}
{"id": "29086318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29086318", "title": "Rock veneer", "text": "Rock veneer\n\nA rock veneer is a geomorphic formation in which rock fragments (clasts) of gravel or cobble size form a thin cover over a surface or hillslope. Rock veneers are typically one or two clasts thick and may partially or fully cover the ground surface.\nVeneers typically form in semiarid and arid regions where chemical weathering rates and the potential for mass wasting are low. Other names for a rock veneer are rock-fragment cover (RFC), stone pavement, desert pavement, stony mantle, hammada and reg.\n\nRock veneers commonly arise from the weathering of resistant rocks of quartzite, felsic granites, coarse granites, and dense basalts. As these larger rocks are deposited on a surface, smaller sands either are removed by wind or water erosion, or settle and form a fine-grained layer beneath the larger veneer rocks. The larger clasts then rearrange and settle to form the rock veneer.\n\nRock veneers form a variety of ways, with two major types; \"in situ\" veneers form in place by means of weathering, fluvial erosion, deflation (the removal of loose, fine-grained particles) or accretion; other veneers are transported via soil creep, sheet flooding or gully gravure (described below). Rock veneers are typically distinguished through six variables: particle size, particle density, stability characteristics, potential for storing mobile sediments, degree of abrasion, and varnishing.\n\nGully gravure is a transportation process by which rock veneers can be formed. Valleys formed of gullies and rills are made and coarse rock fragments are deposited in side channels. As the side channels fill in, water forms new, less resistant channels down the borders of the coarse channels and finer gullies and rills. These channels build up, and the process happens again, resulting in a reversal of rills and gullies, with coarser clasts on the surface.\n\nRoot throw is the process that occurs when a tree topples, raising its rootwad and the rock fragments in it. Fine sediment falls back into the rootwad pit or travels downstream, but coarse sediments form a local rock veneer around the rootwad. This local rock veneer is larger than the pit of the rootwad, as falling clasts extend the area of veneer. In a study of rootwads in Westcliffe, Colorado, it was estimated that root throw could have created a rock veneer over 90% of the surface during the Holocene.\n\nRoot throw produces a rock veneer when there are a large number of clasts near the surface, where there are: a slow rate of chemical weathering, insufficient precipitation to move the large clasts, high velocity winds, conditions favorable to shallow-rooted trees, and trees large enough to embed coarse rock in their roots.\n\nHillslopes with a rock veneer are more stable than those without and have lower erosion rates. Rock veneers form a rocky armor on the hillslope which prevents the erosion of smaller sediments and stabilizes the slope. Rock veneers, forming when influx and outflux sediment rates are equal, indicate a hillslope in equilibrium, partly due to their protective cover on the slope. Erosion rates on veneered hillslopes are low to moderate.\n"}
{"id": "344173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=344173", "title": "Rotational energy", "text": "Rotational energy\n\nRotational energy or angular kinetic energy is kinetic energy due to the rotation of an object and is part of its total kinetic energy. Looking at rotational energy separately around an object's axis of rotation, the following dependence on the object's moment of inertia is observed:\n\nwhere\nThe mechanical work required for / applied during rotation is the torque times the rotation angle. The instantaneous power of an angularly accelerating body is the torque times the angular velocity. For free-floating (unattached) objects, the axis of rotation is commonly around its center of mass.\n\nNote the close relationship between the result for rotational energy and the energy held by linear (or translational) motion:\n\nIn the rotating system, the moment of inertia, \"I\", takes the role of the mass, \"m\", and the angular velocity, formula_6, takes the role of the linear velocity, \"v\". The rotational energy of a rolling cylinder varies from one half of the translational energy (if it is massive) to the same as the translational energy (if it is hollow).\n\nAn example is the calculation of the rotational kinetic energy of the Earth. As the Earth has a period of about 23.93 hours, it has an angular velocity of 7.29×10 rad/s. The Earth has a moment of inertia, I = 8.04×10 kg·m. Therefore, it has a rotational kinetic energy of 2.138×10 J.\n\nAnother example of actually using earth's rotational energy is the locating of opportune spaceports. The European spaceport in French Guiana (Guiana Space Centre) is within about 5 degrees of the equator, so space rocket launches (for primarily geo-stationary satellites) from here to the east obtain nearly all of the full rotational speed of the earth at the equator (about 1,000 mph, sort of a \"sling-shot benefit). Rocket launches easterly from Kennedy (USA) on the other hand obtain only about 400 mph added benefit, due to the lower relative rotational speed of the earth at that northerly latitude. This saves significant rocket fuel per launch, so this tends to be a relatively more economic spaceport.\n\nPart of the earth's rotational energy can also be tapped using tidal power. Additional friction of the two global tidal waves creates energy in a physical manner, infinitesimally slowing down Earth's angular velocity \"ω\". Due to the conservation of angular momentum, this process transfers angular momentum to the Moon's orbital motion, increasing its distance from Earth and its orbital period (see tidal locking for a more detailed explanation of this process).\n\n"}

In truth, Saudi Arabia has signed and approved the convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of biological (bacteriological) and toxin weapons in 1972.\nNevertheless, Saudi Arabia has planned for nuclear foundations and according to some observations, its plans can be led in nuclear weapons. According to some reports, Riyadh has an alleged deal with Pakistan regarding nuclear weapons projects. Moreover, there are claims that Saudi Arabia has used chemical and biological weapons in Yemen.\n\nSaudi Arabia, officially is a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and it has also an agreement with International Atomic Energy Agency. Riyadh has been accused of following nuclear and chemical weapons, despite being a follower of IAEA, NPT and OPCW.\n\nOn the other hand, Riyadh is planning a vast project by the value of $80 billion to build 16 large reactors and several small reactors. The first nuclear reactor is expected to be launched in 2022. Saudi Arabia has invited American companies to have partnership with it in its nuclear program. Besides, it is remarked that Washington commonly asks countries to sign \"123 agreement\" in order not to product nuclear bombs, but so far, Riyadh has refused to sign it or any other agreement which can prevent it from enriching uranium in the future. Meanwhile, Institute for Science and International Security announced that Saudi Arabia will follow atomic weapons due to fear of JCPOA (and Iran), whereas IAEA confirmed that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful, and it not regarded as a dangerous program.\n\nRiyadh officials had travels to France and Russia and signed several transactions, among establishment of atomic foundations in Saudi Arabia. Riyadh is pursuing its open negotiations about establishment of atomic foundations in front of media. Despite that, it has been secretly looking for the establishment of a scientific atomic center by the co-operation of Pakistan, which can be associated with purchasing nuclear weapons from Pakistan.\n\nRiyadh declared that it was following a nuclear power program without co-operation of other countries, and according to a royal command in April 2010: \"The development of atomic energy is essential to meet the Kingdom's growing requirements for energy to generate electricity, produce desalinated water and reduce reliance on depleting hydrocarbon resources.\" KA-CARE has been set up in the capital of Saudi Arabia in order to progress this agenda which is considered as an alternative to oil, and also to be the proper agency for the purpose of treaties on nuclear energy signed by Saudi kingdom. Besides, it appointed the Finland- and Swiss-based Poyry consultancy company in order to assist define \"high-level strategy in the area of nuclear and renewable energy applications\" with desalination.\n\nAs well as this, the (South) Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute has signed an agreement with KA-CARE in March 2015 which is led to evaluate its potential to build two or more than two South Korean SMART reactors. Furthermore, in March/August 2017, the Saudi Arabia Geological Survey signed an agreement to a Chinese nuclear company (CNNC), and it was associated with co-operation on uranium exploration. CNNC mentioned that this will explore 9 potential areas for the resources of uranium in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe BBC reported using multiple sources that Saudi Arabia has funded nuclear weapons development in Pakistan, and the Saudi government believes that it is able to gain nuclear weapons at will. A senior NATO decision maker did mention that he personally viewed intelligence reports indicating that nuclear weapons which have been manufactured in Pakistan by the request of Riyadh, are ready for delivery. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister neither rejected nor confirmed the possibility of purchasing nuclear weapons.\nFurthermore, Saudi royalty and other high-ranking officials have explicitly mentioned warnings in regards to their intention to obtain nuclear weapons if Iran were to come in possession of such weaponry. On 15 March 2018 Saudi defence minister and heir to the throne Prince Mohammad bin Salman made such a statement on the CBS 60 Minutes programme.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Saudi Arabian attempts to acquire ballistic missiles capable of fielding a nuclear warhead go back several decades. Riyadh possesses DF-3A (NATO: CSS-2) as a Chinese missile which is used in nuclear weapons delivery.\nIn fact, it is regarded as a Chinese liquid-fueled, single-stage, nuclear medium-range ballistic missile. Saudi Arabia bought several dozen (between 36 and 60) of this kind of missile from China in 1987. Riyadh displayed them in a parade 2014, the first public viewing of the weapons.\n\nOfficially, Saudi Arabia is regarded as a party to both the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), and also the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Of course, it has been mentioned by some reports that Saudi Arabia directly/indirectly has been used chemical and biological weapons in the wars and also Saudi Arabian chemical materials has been discovered in the city of Aleppo, an official news agency of Syria said. Additionally, Yemeni Major General Khalid al-Barayemi pointed out that there have been found chemical weapons in several trucks bounds of Saudi Arabia for the areas that are under the control of ISIS and likewise Al-Qaeda. As well as charging of using chemical and biological weapons, there are other charges for Riyadh, too.\n\nWhile it has taken four years to campaign Saudi Arabia in Yemen, groups of human rights have repeatedly accused it of civilian casualties during the bombardment in Yemen. According to reports of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, almost 6,000 civilians were killed and 9,500 wounded from March 2015 and February 2018. \n\nAccording to the investigation of 10 Saudi-led airstrikes on March 2018, 157 deaths and 135 injuries were reported and it showed that Riyadh's attempt to control harm to children \"remain largely ineffective.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia is officially considered as a state party to (biological and) toxin weapons. And according to this agreement(s), the States Parties have undertaken to prepared annual reports upon particular activities relevant to the Biological Weapons Convention which consists of information on prevalence of infectious diseases, and also similar events which are caused by toxins; etc.\n\n\"The Saudi government's use of weapons which contain toxic and pathogenic gases in air and missile strikes against residential areas is aimed at genocide and breaking the legitimate resistance of the brave Yemeni people,\" Shamkhani as the Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) did remark in a meeting which was held with an agent of Yemen's high council of revolution in Iran. Meanwhile, according to a report by the human rights watch, Saudi Arabia has used a kind of poisonous gas in four airstrikes on diverse parts of the province of Sa'ada in Yemen.\n\nSunjeev Bery, Amnesty International's advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa stated that “The United States must not provide or sell white phosphorus munitions to Saudi Arabia or any other military that would use them in the Yemen conflict,” On other hands some images and videos posted to social media shows that Saudi Arabia appears to be using U.S.-supplied white phosphorus munitions in its war in Yemen.

It covers an area of . It is estimated that two-thirds of the original forests have been cleared, and only 3,200 square kilometers, or 15% of the intact area, is protected.\n\nThe southern portion of the Western Ghats contains the highest peaks in the range, notably Anai Mudi in Kerala, at 2695 meters elevation. The Ghats intercept the moisture-laden monsoon winds off the Arabian Sea, and the average annual precipitation exceeds 2,800 mm. The northeast monsoon from October to November supplements the June to September southwest monsoon. The South Western Ghats are the wettest portion of peninsular India, and are surrounded by drier ecoregions to the east and north.\n\nThe cool and moist climate, high rainfall, and variety of microclimates brought about by differences in elevation and exposure supports lush and diverse forests; 35% of the plant species are endemic to the ecoregion. Moist evergreen montane forests are the predominant habitat type. The montane evergreen forests support a great diversity of species. The trees generally form a canopy at 15 to 20 m, and the forests are multistoried and rich in epiphytes, especially orchids. Characteristic canopy trees are \"Cullenia exarillata\", \"Mesua ferrea\", \"Palaquium ellipticum\", \"Gluta travancorica\", and \"Nageia wallichiana\". \"Nageia\" is a podocarp conifer with origins in the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, of which India was formerly part, and a number of other plants in the ecoregion have Gondwana origins.

It is a southern variation of Northern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic.\n\nThe ecoregion extends along the coast of Tanzania and Mozambique, from Tanzania's Lukuledi River south almost the whole way to the mouth of the Limpopo River. The ecoregion supports habitats of forest, savanna and swamps.\n\nThe ecoregion is bounded on the east by the Indian Ocean. To the north, it abuts the Northern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic. It transitions to drier open woodlands to the west – the Eastern Miombo woodlands at the northern end, the Zambezian and Mopane woodlands in the central portion, and the Southern Miombo woodlands at the southern end. To the south, it borders the Maputaland coastal forest mosaic. It also includes some small offshore islands in Mozambique, including the Quirimbas Islands and Bazarruto Archipelago.\n\nThe ecoregion is mostly coastal, generally within 50 km of the Indian Ocean. It encompasses coastal lowlands, rolling hills, and isolated plateaus and inselbergs, including the Rondo and Makonde plateaus in southern Tanzania and the Mueda Plateau in northern Mozambique. It includes some isolated mountainous enclaves further inland, including Mount Chiperone, Mount Mabu, Mount Morrumbala, Mount Namuli, and Mount Tumbine in Mozambique. The mountains intercept humid southwesterly winds from the Indian Ocean, which form clouds and rain and create a cooler, wetter climate than the surrounding lowlands. These mountains are home to lowland evergreen forests with a similar flora to the coastal lowland forests, and higher-elevation montane forests, woodlands, grasslands, and heathlands which are home to many Afromontane species.\n\nThe southern portion of the ecoregion is not very well known due to the prolonged civil war in Mozambique.\n\nThe climate is tropical in the northern portion, becoming sub-tropical at the southern end. In the area around Lindi in Tanzania there is one long dry season and one wet season. Rainfall is 800–1000 mm per year, and is higher on some of the plateaus and mountains. The climate is similar in the Mozambican portion, although rainfall is lower (800 mm) in northern Mozambique, which is in the rain shadow of Madagascar. Mean maximum temperatures are 30-27° C in the north and 24° C in the south, and mean minimum temperature is 18-15° C throughout the ecoregion.\n\nProtected areas within the ecoregion include:\n\n\n\n"}

These are mainly polymers synthesized from petroleum byproducts. About of rubbers are produced annually, and of that amount two thirds are synthetic. Global revenues generated with synthetic rubbers are likely to rise to approximately US$56 billion in 2020. Synthetic rubber, like natural rubber, has uses in the automotive industry for tires, door and window profiles, hoses, belts, matting, and flooring.\n\nThe expanded use of bicycles, and particularly their pneumatic tires, starting in the 1890s, created increased demand for rubber. In 1909, a team headed by Fritz Hofmann, working at the Bayer laboratory in Elberfeld, Germany, succeeded in polymerizing isoprene, the first synthetic rubber.\n\nThe first rubber polymer synthesized from butadiene was created in 1910 by the Russian scientist Sergei Vasiljevich Lebedev. This form of synthetic rubber provided the basis for the first large-scale commercial production by the tsarist empire, which occurred during World War I as a result of shortages of natural rubber. This early form of synthetic rubber was again replaced with natural rubber after the war ended, but investigations of synthetic rubber continued. Russian American Ivan Ostromislensky who moved to New York in 1922 did significant early research on synthetic rubber and a couple of monomers in the early 20th century. Political problems that resulted from great fluctuations in the cost of natural rubber led to the enactment of the Stevenson Act in 1921. This act essentially created a cartel which supported rubber prices by regulating production, but insufficient supply, especially due to wartime shortages, also led to a search for alternative forms of synthetic rubber.\n\nBy 1925 the price of natural rubber had increased to the point that many companies were exploring methods of producing synthetic rubber to compete with natural rubber. In the United States, the investigation focused on different materials than in Europe, building on the early laboratory work of Fr Julius Nieuwland, a professor of chemistry at the University of Notre Dame, who developed the synthesis of neoprene.\n\nStudies published in 1930 written independently by Lebedev, the American Wallace Carothers and the German scientist Hermann Staudinger led in 1931 to one of the first successful synthetic rubbers, known as neoprene, which was developed at DuPont under the direction of E. K. Bolton. Neoprene is highly resistant to heat and chemicals such as oil and gasoline, and is used in fuel hoses and as an insulating material in machinery. The company Thiokol applied their name to a competing type of rubber based on ethylene dichloride, which was commercially available in 1930.\n\nThe first rubber plant in Europe (from Russian \"Synthetic Kauchuk\", ) was established (Russia) by Sergei Lebedev in Yaroslavl under Joseph Stalin's first five-year plan on July 7, 1932.\n\nIn 1935, German chemists synthesized the first of a series of synthetic rubbers known as Buna rubbers. These were copolymers, meaning the polymers were made up from two monomers in alternating sequence. Other brands included \"Koroseal\", which Waldo Semon developed in 1935, and \"Sovprene\", which Russian researchers created in 1940.\n\nB. F. Goodrich Company scientist Waldo Semon developed a new and cheaper version of synthetic rubber known as Ameripol in 1940. Ameripol made synthetic rubber production much more cost effective, helping to meet the United States' needs during World War II.\n\nThe production of synthetic rubber in the United States expanded greatly during World War II, since the Axis powers controlled nearly all the world's limited supplies of natural rubber by mid-1942. Military trucks needed rubber for tires, and rubber was used in almost every other war machine. The U.S. government launched a major (and largely secret) effort to improve synthetic rubber production. A large team of chemists from many institutions were involved, including Calvin Souther Fuller of Bell Labs. The rubber designated GRS (Government Rubber Styrene), a copolymer of butadiene and styrene, was the basis for U.S. synthetic rubber production during World War II. By 1944, a total of 50 factories were manufacturing it, pouring out a volume of the material twice that of the world's natural rubber production before the beginning of the war. It still represents about half of total world production.\n\nOperation Pointblank bombing targets of Nazi Germany included the Schkopau (50,000 tons/yr) plant and the Hüls synthetic rubber plant near Recklinghausen (30,000, 17%), and the Kölnische Gummifäden Fabrik tire and tube plant at Deutz on the east bank of the Rhine. The Ferrara, Italy, synthetic rubber factory (near a river bridge) was bombed August 23, 1944. Three other synthetic rubber facilities were at Ludwigshafen/Oppau (15,000), Hanover/Limmer (reclamation, 20,000), and Leverkusen (5,000). A synthetic rubber plant at Oświęcim, in Nazi-occupied Poland, was under construction on March 5, 1944 operated by IG Farben and supplied with slave labor, by the SS, from the associated camp Auschwitz III (Monowitz).\n\nSolid-fuel rockets during World War II used nitrocellulose for propellants, but it was impractical and dangerous to make such rockets very large. During the war, California Institute of Technology (Caltech) researchers came up with a new solid fuel based on asphalt mixed with an oxidizer (such as potassium or ammonium perchlorate), and aluminium powder. This new solid fuel burned more slowly and evenly than nitrocellulose, and was much less dangerous to store and use, but it tended to slowly flow out of the rocket in storage and the rockets using it had to be stockpiled nose down.\n\nAfter the war, Caltech researchers began to investigate the use of synthetic rubbers to replace asphalt in their solid fuel rocket motors. By the mid-1950s, large missiles were being built using solid fuels based on synthetic rubber, mixed with ammonium perchlorate and high proportions of aluminium powder. Such solid fuels could be cast into large, uniform blocks that had no cracks or other defects that would cause non-uniform burning. Ultimately, all large solid-fuel military rockets and missiles would use synthetic-rubber-based solid fuels, and they would also play a significant part in the civilian space effort.\n\nAdditional refinements to the process of creating synthetic rubber continued after the war. The chemical synthesis of isoprene accelerated the reduced need for natural rubber, and the peacetime quantity of synthetic rubber exceeded the production of natural rubber by the early 1960s.\n\nSynthetic rubber is used a great deal in printing on textiles, in which case it is called rubber paste. In most cases titanium dioxide is used with copolymerization and volatile matter in producing such synthetic rubber for textile use. Moreover, this kind of preparation can be considered to be the pigment preparation based on titanium dioxide.\n\nBy the 1960s, most chewing gum companies had switched from using chicle to butadiene-based synthetic rubber which was cheaper to manufacture.\n\nNatural rubber, coming from latex of \"Hevea brasiliensis\", is mainly poly-\"cis\"-isoprene containing traces of impurities like protein, dirt etc. Although it exhibits many excellent properties in terms of mechanical performance, natural rubber is often inferior to certain synthetic rubbers, especially with respect to its thermal stability and its compatibility with petroleum products.\n\nSynthetic rubber, like other polymers, is made from various petroleum-based monomers. The most prevalent synthetic rubbers are styrene-butadiene rubbers (SBR) derived from the copolymerization of styrene and 1,3-butadiene. Other synthetic rubbers are prepared from isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene), chloroprene (2-chloro-1,3-butadiene), and isobutylene (methylpropene) with a small percentage of isoprene for cross-linking. These and other monomers can be mixed in various proportions to be copolymerized to produce products with a range of physical, mechanical, and chemical properties. The monomers can be produced pure, and the addition of impurities or additives can be controlled by design to give optimal properties. Polymerization of pure monomers can be better controlled to give a desired proportion of \"cis\" and \"trans\" double bonds.\n\n"}
{"id": "44190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44190", "title": "The Selfish Gene", "text": "The Selfish Gene\n\nThe Selfish Gene is a 1976 book on evolution by Richard Dawkins, in which the author builds upon the principal theory of George C. Williams's \"Adaptation and Natural Selection\" (1966). Dawkins uses the term \"selfish gene\" as a way of expressing the gene-centred view of evolution as opposed to the views focused on the organism and the group, popularising ideas developed during the 1960s by W. D. Hamilton and others. From the gene-centred view, it follows that the more two individuals are genetically related, the more sense (at the level of the genes) it makes for them to behave selflessly with each other.\n\nA lineage is expected to evolve to maximise its inclusive fitness—the number of copies of its genes passed on globally (rather than by a particular individual). As a result, populations will tend towards an evolutionarily stable strategy. The book also coins the term \"meme\" for a unit of human cultural evolution analogous to the gene, suggesting that such \"selfish\" replication may also model human culture, in a different sense. Memetics has become the subject of many studies since the publication of the book. In raising awareness of Hamilton's ideas, as well as making its own valuable contributions to the field, the book has also stimulated research on human inclusive fitness.\n\nIn the foreword to the book's 30th-anniversary edition, Dawkins said he \"can readily see that [the book's title] might give an inadequate impression of its contents\" and in retrospect thinks he should have taken Tom Maschler's advice and called the book \"The Immortal Gene\".\n\nIn July 2017, \"The Selfish Gene\" was listed as the most influential science book of all time in a poll to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Royal Society science book prize.\n\nDawkins builds upon George C. Williams's book \"Adaptation and Natural Selection\" (1966), which argued that altruism is not based upon group benefit \"per se\", but is a result of selection that occurs \"at the level of the gene mediated by the phenotype\" and any selection at the group level occurred only under rare circumstances. This approach was developed further during the 1960s by W. D. Hamilton and others who opposed group selection and selection aimed directly at benefit to the individual organism:\n\nDespite the principle of 'survival of the fittest' the ultimate criterion which determines whether [a gene] \"G\" will spread is not whether the behavior is to the benefit of the behaver, but whether it is to the benefit of the gene \"G\" ...With altruism this will happen only if the affected individual is a relative of the altruist, therefore having an increased chance of carrying the gene.\n\nAn extended discussion of Dawkins' views and his book \"The Selfish Gene\" is provided by Wilkins and Hull.\n\nDawkins begins by discussing the altruism that people display, indicating that he will argue it is explained by gene selfishness, and attacking group selection as an explanation. He considers the origin of life with the arrival of molecules able to replicate themselves. From there, he looks at DNA's role in evolution, and its organisation into chromosomes and genes, which in his view behave selfishly. He describes organisms as apparently purposive but fundamentally simple survival machines, which use negative feedback to achieve control. This extends, he argues, to the brain's ability to simulate the world with subjective consciousness, and signalling between species. He then introduces the idea of the evolutionarily stable strategy, and uses it to explain why alternative competitive strategies like bullying and retaliating exist. This allows him to consider what selfishness in a gene might actually mean, describing W. D. Hamilton's argument for kin selection, that genes for behaviour that improves the survival chances of close relatives can spread in a population, because those relatives carry the same genes. \n\nDawkins examines childbearing and raising children as evolutionary strategies. He attacks the idea of group selection for the good of the species as proposed by V. C. Wynne-Edwards, arguing instead that each parent necessarily behaves selfishly. A question is whether parents should invest in their offspring equally or should favour some of them, and explains that what is best for the survival of the parents' genes is not always best for individual children. Similarly, Dawkins argues, there are conflicts of interest between males and females, but he notes that R. A. Fisher showed that the optimal sex ratio is 50:50. He explains that this is true even in an extreme case like the harem-keeping elephant seal, where 4% of the males get 88% of copulations. In that case, the strategy of having a female offspring is safe, as she'll have a pup, but the strategy of having a male can bring a large return (dozens of pups), even though many males live out their lives as bachelors. Amotz Zahavi's theory of honest signalling explains stotting as a selfish act, he argues, improving the springbok's chances of escaping from a predator by indicating how difficult the chase would be. \n\nDawkins discusses why many species live in groups, achieving mutual benefits through mechanisms such as Hamilton's selfish herd model: each individual behaves selfishly but the result is herd behaviour. Altruism too can evolve, as in the social insects such as ants and bees, where workers give up the right to reproduce in favour of a sister, the queen; in their case, the unusual (haplodiploid) system of sex determination may have helped to bring this about, as females in a nest are exceptionally closely related.\n\nThe final chapter of the first edition introduced the idea of the meme, a culturally-transmitted entity such as a hummable tune, by analogy to genetic transmission. Dawkins describes God as an old idea which probably arose many times, and which has sufficient psychological appeal to survive effectively in the meme pool. The second edition (1989) added two more chapters.\n\nIn describing genes as being \"selfish\", Dawkins states unequivocally that he does not intend to imply that they are driven by any motives or will, but merely that their effects can be metaphorically and pedagogically described \"as if\" they were. His contention is that the genes that are passed on are the ones whose evolutionary consequences serve their own implicit interest (to continue the anthropomorphism) in being replicated, not necessarily those of the organism. In later work, Dawkins brings evolutionary \"selfishness\" down to creation of a widely proliferated \"extended phenotype\".\n\nFor some, the metaphor of \"selfishness\" is entirely clear, while to others it is confusing, misleading, or simply silly to ascribe mental attributes to something that is mindless. For example, Andrew Brown has written:\n\nDonald Symons also finds it inappropriate to use anthropomorphism in conveying scientific meaning in general, and particularly for the present instance. He writes in \"The Evolution of Human Sexuality\" (1979):\n\nDawkins proposes the idea of the \"replicator\":\n\nThe original replicator (Dawkins' \"Replicator\") was the initial molecule which first managed to reproduce itself and thus gained an advantage over other molecules within the primordial soup. As replicating molecules became more complex, Dawkins postulates, the replicators became the genes within organisms, with each organism's body serving the purpose of a 'survival machine' for its genes.\n\nDawkins writes that gene combinations which help an organism to survive and reproduce tend to also improve the gene's own chances of being replicated, and, as a result, \"successful\" genes frequently provide a benefit to the organism. An example of this might be a gene that protects the organism against a disease. This helps the gene spread, and also helps the organism.\n\nThere are other times when the implicit interests of the vehicle and replicator are in conflict, such as the genes behind certain male spiders' instinctive mating behaviour, which increase the organism's inclusive fitness by allowing it to reproduce, but shorten its life by exposing it to the risk of being eaten by the cannibalistic female. Another example is the existence of segregation distorter genes that are detrimental to their host, but nonetheless propagate themselves at its expense. Likewise, the persistence of junk DNA that [Dawkins believed at that time] provides no benefit to its host can be explained on the basis that it is not subject to selection. These unselected for but transmitted DNA variations connect the individual genetically to its parents, but confer no survival benefit.\n\nThese examples might suggest that there is a power struggle between genes and their interactor. In fact, the claim is that there isn't much of a struggle because the genes usually win without a fight. However, the claim is made that if the organism becomes intelligent enough to understand its own interests, as distinct from those of its genes, there can be true conflict.\n\nAn example of such a conflict might be a person using birth control to prevent fertilisation, thereby inhibiting the replication of his or her genes. But this action might not be a conflict of the 'self-interest' of the organism with his or her genes, since a person using birth control might also be enhancing the survival chances of their genes by limiting family size to conform with available resources, thus avoiding extinction as predicted under the Malthusian model of population growth.\n\nDawkins says that his \"purpose\" in writing \"The Selfish Gene\" is \"to examine the biology of selfishness and altruism.\" He does this by supporting the claim that \"gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behaviour. However, as we shall see, there are special circumstances in which a gene can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a limited form of altruism at the level of individual animals.\" Gene selection provides one explanation for kin selection and eusociality, where organisms act altruistically, against their individual interests (in the sense of health, safety or personal reproduction), namely the argument that by helping related organisms reproduce, a gene succeeds in \"helping\" copies of themselves (or sequences with the same phenotypic effect) in other bodies to replicate. The claim is made that these \"selfish\" actions of genes lead to unselfish actions by organisms. A requirement upon this claim, supported by Dawkins in Chapter 10: \"You scratch my back, I'll ride on yours\" by examples from nature, is the need to explain how genes achieve kin recognition, or manage to orchestrate mutualism and coevolution. Although Dawkins (and biologists in general) recognize these phenomena result in more copies of a gene, evidence is inconclusive whether this success is selected for at a group or individual level. In fact, Dawkins has proposed that it is at the level of the \"extended phenotype\": \n\nAlthough Dawkins agrees that groups can assist survival, they rank as a \"vehicle\" for survival only if the group activity is replicated in descendants, recorded in the gene, the gene being the only true replicator. An improvement in the survival lottery for the group must improve that for the gene for sufficient replication to occur. Dawkins argues qualitatively that the lottery for the gene is based upon a very long and broad record of events, and group advantages are usually too specific, too brief, and too fortuitous to change the gene lottery.\n\nPrior to the 1960s, it was common for altruism to be explained in terms of group selection, where the benefits to the organism or even population were supposed to account for the popularity of the genes responsible for the tendency towards that behaviour. Modern versions of \"multilevel selection\" claim to have overcome the original objections, namely, that at that time no known form of group selection led to an evolutionarily stable strategy. The claim still is made by some that it would take only a single individual with a tendency towards more selfish behaviour to undermine a population otherwise filled only with the gene for altruism towards non-kin.\n\n\"The Selfish Gene\" was extremely popular when first published, causing \"a silent and almost immediate revolution in biology\", and it continues to be widely read. It has sold over a million copies, and has been translated into more than 25 languages. Proponents argue that the central point, that replicating the gene is the object of selection, usefully completes and extends the explanation of evolution given by Charles Darwin before the basic mechanisms of genetics were understood.\n\nAccording to the ethologist Alan Grafen, acceptance of adaptionist theories is hampered by a lack of a mathematical unifying theory and a belief that anything in words alone must be suspect. According to Grafen, these difficulties along with an initial conflict with population genetics models at the time of its introduction \"explains why within biology the considerable scientific contributions it [\"The Selfish Gene\"] makes are seriously underestimated, and why it is viewed mainly as a work of exposition.\" According to comparative psychologist Nicky Hayes, \"Dawkins presented a version of sociobiology that rested heavily on metaphors drawn from animal behavior, and extrapolated these...One of the weaknesses of the sociological approach is that it tends only to seek confirmatory examples from among the huge diversity of animal behavior. Dawkins did not deviate from this tradition.\" More generally, critics argue that \"The Selfish Gene\" oversimplifies the relationship between genes and the organism. (As an example, see Thompson.)\n\n\"The Selfish Gene\" further popularised sociobiology in Japan after its translation in 1980.\n\nWith the addition of Dawkins's book to the country's consciousness, the term \"meme\" entered popular culture. Yuzuru Tanaka of Hokkaido University wrote a book, \"Meme Media and Meme Market Architectures\", while the psychologist Susan Blackmore wrote \"The Meme Machine\" (2000), with a foreword by Dawkins. The information scientist Osamu Sakura has published a book in Japanese and several papers in English on the topic. Nippon Animation produced an educational television program titled \"The Many Journeys of Meme\".\n\nIn 1976, the ecologist Arthur Cain, one of Dawkins's tutors at Oxford in the 1960s, called it a \"young man's book\" (which Dawkins points out was a deliberate quote of a commentator on the New College, Oxford philosopher A. J. Ayer's \"Language, Truth, and Logic\" (1936)). Dawkins noted that he had been \"flattered by the comparison, [but] knew that Ayer had recanted much of his first book and [he] could hardly miss Cain's pointed implication that [he] should, in the fullness of time, do the same.\" This point also was made by the philosopher Mary Midgley: \"The same thing happened to AJ Ayer, she says, but he spent the rest of his career taking back what he'd written in \"Language, Truth and Logic\". \"This hasn't occurred to Dawkins\", she says. \"He goes on saying the same thing.\"\" However, according to Wilkins and Hull, Dawkins' thinking has developed, although perhaps not defusing this criticism:\n\nAs to the unit of selection: \"One internally consistent logical picture is that the unit of replication is the gene...and the organism is one kind of ...entity on which selection acts directly.\" Dawkins proposed the matter without a distinction between 'unit of replication' and 'unit of selection' that he made elsewhere: \"the fundamental unit of selection, and therefore of self-interest, is not the species, nor the group, nor even strictly the individual. It is the gene, the unit of heredity.\" However, he continues in a later chapter:\n\nDawkins' later formulation is in his book \"The Extended Phenotype\" (1982), where the process of selection is taken to involve every possible phenotypical effect of a gene.\n\nStephen Jay Gould finds Dawkins' position tries to have it both ways:\n\nThe view of \"The Selfish Gene\" is that selection based upon groups and populations is rare compared to selection on individuals. Although supported by Dawkins and by many others, this claim continues to be disputed. While naïve versions of group selectionism have been disproved, more sophisticated formulations make accurate predictions in some cases while positing selection at higher levels. Both sides agree that very favourable genes are likely to prosper and replicate if they arise and both sides agree that living in groups can be an advantage to the group members. The conflict arises in part over defining concepts: \n\nIn \"The Social Conquest of Earth\" (2012), the entomologist E. O. Wilson contends that although the selfish-gene approach was accepted \"until 2010 [when] Martin Nowak, Corina Tarnita, and I demonstrated that inclusive fitness theory, often called kin selection theory, is both mathematically and biologically incorrect.\" Chapter 18 of \"The Social Conquest of Earth\" describes the deficiencies of kin selection and outlines group selection, which Wilson argues is a more realistic model of social evolution. He criticises earlier approaches to social evolution, saying: \"...unwarranted faith in the central role of kinship in social evolution has led to the reversal of the usual order in which biological research is conducted. The proven best way in evolutionary biology, as in most of science, is to define a problem arising during empirical research, then select or devise the theory that is needed to solve it. Almost all research in inclusive-fitness theory has been the opposite: hypothesize the key roles of kinship and kin selection, then look for evidence to test that hypothesis.\" According to Wilson: \"People must have a tribe...Experiments conducted over many years by social psychologists have revealed how swiftly and decisively people divide into groups, and then discriminate in favor of the one to which they belong.\" (pp. 57, 59) According to Wilson: \"Different parts of the brain have evolved by group selection to create groupishness.\" (p. 61)\n\nSome authors consider facets of this debate between Dawkins and his critics about the level of selection to be blather:\n\nOther authors say Dawkins has failed to make some critical distinctions, in particular, the difference between group selection for group advantage and group selection conveying individual advantage.\n\nA good deal of objection to \"The Selfish Gene\" stemmed from its failure to be always clear about \"selection\" and \"replication\". Dawkins says the gene is the fundamental unit of selection, and then points out that selection doesn't act directly upon the gene, but upon 'vehicles' or 'extended phenotypes'. Stephen Jay Gould took exception to calling the gene a 'unit of selection' because selection acted only upon phenotypes. Summarizing the Dawkins-Gould difference of view, Sterelny says:\n\nThe word 'cause' here is somewhat tricky: does a change in lottery rules (for example, inheriting a defective gene \"responsible\" for a disorder) 'cause' differences in outcome that might or might not occur? It certainly alters the likelihood of events, but a concatenation of contingencies decides what actually occurs. Dawkins thinks the use of 'cause' as a statistical weighting is acceptable in common usage. Like Gould, Gabriel Dover in criticizing \"The Selfish Gene\" says:\n\nHowever, from a comparison with Dawkins' discussion of this very same point, it would seem both Gould's and Dover's comments are more a critique of his sloppy usage than a difference of views. Hull suggested a resolution based upon a distinction between replicators and interactors. The term 'replicator' includes genes as the most fundamental replicators but possibly other agents, and \"interactor\" includes organisms but maybe other agents, much as do Dawkins' 'vehicles'. The distinction is as follows:\n\nHull suggests that, despite some similarities, Dawkins takes too narrow a view of these terms, engendering some of the objections to his views. According to Godfrey-Smith, this more careful vocabulary has cleared up \"misunderstandings in the \"units of selection\" debates.\"\n\nBehavioural genetics entertains the view:\n\nThis view from 1970 is still espoused today, and conflicts with Dawkins' view of \"the gene as a form of \"information [that] passes through bodies and affects them, but is not affected by them on its way through\"\". The philosophical/biological field of enactivism stresses the interaction of the living agent with its environment and the relation of probing the environment to cognition and adaptation. Gene activation depends upon the cellular milieu. An extended discussion of the contrasts between enactivism and Dawkins' views, and with their support by Dennett, is provided by Thompson.\n\nIn \"Mind in Life\", the philosopher Evan Thompson has assembled a multi-sourced objection to the \"selfish gene\" idea. Thompson takes issue with Dawkin's reduction of \"life\" to \"genes\" and \"information\":\n\nThompson objects that the gene cannot operate by itself, since it requires an environment such as a cell, and life is \"the creative outcome of highly structured contingencies\". Thompson quotes Sarkar:\n\nThompson follows with a detailed examination of the concept of DNA as a look-up-table and the role of the cell in orchestrating the DNA-to-RNA transcription, indicating that by anyone's account the DNA is hardly the whole story. Thompson goes on to suggest that the cell-environment interrelationship has much to do with reproduction and inheritance, and a focus on the gene as a form of \"information [that] passes through bodies and affects them, but is not affected by them on its way through\" is tantamount to adoption of a form of material-informational dualism that has no explanatory value and no scientific basis. (Thomson, p. 187) The enactivist view, however, is that information results from the probing and experimentation of the agent with the agent's environment subject to the limitations of the agent's abilities to probe and process the result of probing, and DNA is simply one mechanism the agent brings to bear upon its activity.\n\nAnother criticism of the book is its treatment of morality, and more particularly altruism, as existing only as a form of selfishness:\n\nThe philosopher Mary Midgley has suggested this position is a variant of Hobbes' explanation of altruism as enlightened self-interest, and that Dawkins goes a step further to suggest that our genetic programming can be overcome by what amounts to an extreme version of free will. Part of Mary Midgley's concern is that Richard Dawkins' account of \"The Selfish Gene\" serves as a moral and ideological justification for selfishness to be adopted by modern human societies as simply following \"nature\", providing an excuse for behavior with bad consequences for future human society.\n\nDawkins' major concluding theme, that humanity is finally gaining power over the \"selfish replicators\" by virtue of their intelligence, is criticized also by primatologist Frans de Waal, who refers to it as an example of a \"veneer theory\" (the idea that morality is not fundamental, but is laid over a brutal foundation). Dawkins claims he merely describes how things are under evolution, and makes no moral arguments. On BBC-2 TV, Dawkins pointed to evidence for a \"Tit-for-Tat\" strategy (shown to be successful in game theory) as the most common, simple, and profitable choice.\n\nMore generally, the objection has been made that \"The Selfish Gene\" discusses philosophical and moral questions that go beyond biological arguments, relying upon anthropomorphisms and careless analogies.\n\n\"The Selfish Gene\" was first published by Oxford University Press in 1976 in eleven chapters with a preface by the author and a foreword by Robert Trivers. A second edition was published in 1989. This edition added two extra chapters, and substantial endnotes to the preceding chapters, reflecting new findings and thoughts. It also added a second preface by the author, but the original foreword by Trivers was dropped. The book contains no illustrations.\n\nThe book has been translated into at least 23 languages including Arabic, Thai and Turkish. \n\nIn 2006, a 30th-anniversary edition was published with the Trivers foreword and a new introduction by the author. It was accompanied by a \"festschrift\" entitled \"\" (2006). In March 2006, a special event entitled \"The Selfish Gene\": Thirty Years On was held at the London School of Economics. In March 2011, Audible Inc published an audiobook edition narrated by Richard Dawkins and Lalla Ward.\n\nIn 2016, Oxford University Press published a 40th anniversary edition with a new epilogue, in which Dawkins describes the continued relevance of the gene's eye view of evolution and states that it, along with coalescence analysis \"illuminates the deep past in ways of which I had no inkling when I first wrote \"The Selfish Gene\"...\"\n\nIn April 2016, \"The Selfish Gene\" was listed as number 10 on \"The Guardian\"'s list of the 100 best nonfiction books, by Robert McCrum.\n\nIn July 2017, the book was listed as the most influential science book of all time in a poll to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Royal Society science book prize, ahead of Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" and Isaac Newton’s \"Principia Mathematica\".\n\n\n\n"}

As an air mass travels through the wave, it undergoes repeated uplift and descent. If there is enough moisture in the atmosphere, clouds will form at the cooled crests of these waves. In the descending part of the wave, those clouds will evaporate due to adiabatic heating, leading to the characteristic clouded and clear bands. The cloud base on the leeward side is higher than on the windward side, because precipitation on the windward side removes water from the air.\n\nIt is possible that simple convection from mountain summits can also form wave clouds. This occurs as the convection forces a wave or lenticular wave cloud into the more stable air above.\n\nWave clouds are typically mid- to upper-tropospheric ice clouds. They are relatively easy to study, because they are quite consistent. As a result, they are being analyzed to increase our understanding of how these upper-level ice clouds influence the Earth's radiation budget. Understanding this can improve climate models.\n\nThe streamlines in these clouds have the steepest slope a few kilometers downwind of the lee slope of a mountain. It is in these regions of highest vertical velocity that sailplanes can reach record-breaking altitudes.\n\nIn an ideal model, a wave cloud consists of supercooled liquid water at the lower part, a mixed phase of frozen and liquid water near the ridge, and ice beginning slightly below the ridge and extending downstream. However, this doesn't always occur. Wave cloud structure ranges from smooth and simple, to jumbled phases occurring randomly. Often, ice crystals can be found downwind of the waves. Whether this happens depends on the saturation of the air. The composition of the ice is currently an active topic of study. The main mechanism for ice formation is homogeneous nucleation. The ice crystals are mostly small spheroidal and irregular-shaped particles. Ice columns make up less than 1%, and plates are virtually nonexistent.\nMulti-level mountain wave clouds form when the moisture in the air above the mountain is located in distinct layers, and vertical mixing is inhibited.\n\n"}

The volume made \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list, was the 1991 winner of the Royal Society's Rhone-Poulenc Prize, the American Historical Association's Forkosch Award, and was a 1991 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Gould described his later book \"\" (1996) as a companion volume to \"Wonderful Life\".\n\nGould's thesis in \"Wonderful Life\" was that contingency plays a major role in the evolutionary history of life. He based his argument on the extraordinarily well preserved fossils of the Burgess Shale, a rich fossil-bearing deposit dating 505 million years ago. Gould argues that during this period just after the Cambrian explosion there was a greater disparity of anatomical body plans (phyla) than exist today. However most of these phyla left no modern descendants. All of the Burgess animals, Gould argues, were exquisitely adapted to their environment, and there exist little evidence that the survivors were any better adapted than their extinct contemporaries.\n\nGould proposed that given a chance to \"rewind the tape of life\" and let it play again, we might find ourselves living in a world populated by descendants of \"Hallucigenia\" rather than \"Pikaia\" (the ancestor of all vertebrates). Gould's stressed that his argument was not based on \"randomness\" but rather \"contingency\"; a process by which historical outcomes arise from an unpredictable sequence of antecedent states, where any change in the sequence alters the final result. Because fitness for existing conditions does not guarantee long-term survival — particularly when conditions change catastrophically — the survival of many species depends more on luck than conventional features of anatomical superiority. Gould maintains that, \"traits that\nenhance survival during an extinction do so in ways that are incidental and unrelated to the causes of their evolution in the first place.\" Gould earlier coined the term exaptation to describe fortuitously beneficial traits, which are adaptive but arise for reasons other than incremental natural selection.\n\nGould regarded \"Opabinia\"—an odd creature with five eyes and frontal nozzle—as so important to understanding the Cambrian explosion that he wanted to call his book \"Homage to Opabinia\". Gould wrote: \n\n\"Wonderful Life\" quickly climbed the national bestseller lists within weeks of publication. It stimulated wide discussion regarding the nature of progress and contingency in evolution. Gould's controversial thesis was that if the history of life were replayed over again, human level intelligence would prove unlikely to ever arise again. In his review, the biologist Richard Dawkins wrote that, \"\"Wonderful Life\" is a beautifully written and deeply muddled book. To make unputdownable an intricate, technical account of the anatomies of worms, and other inconspicuous denizens of a half-billion-year-old sea, is a literary \"tour-de-force\". But the theory that Stephen Gould wrings out of his fossils is a sorry mess.\" The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr argued that Gould, \"made such contingencies a major theme in \"Wonderful Life\", and I have come to the conclusion that here he may be largely right.\"\n\nBiologist John Maynard Smith wrote, \"I agree with Gould that evolution is not in general predictable. … Although I agree with Gould about contingency, I find the problem of progress harder. … I do think that progress has happened, although I find it hard to define precisely what I mean.\" Philosopher Michael Ruse wrote that, \"\"Wonderful Life\" was the best book written by the late Stephen Jay Gould, paleontologist and popular science writer. It is … a thrilling story that Gould tells in a way that no one else could equal.\"\n\nSome of the anatomical reconstructions cited by Gould were soon challenged as being incorrect, most notably Simon Conway Morris' 1977 reconstruction of \"Hallucigenia\". Conway Morris' reconstruction was, \"so peculiar, so hard to imagine as an efficiently working beast\" Gould speculated that \"Hallucigenia\" might be \"a complex appendage of a larger creature, still undiscovered.\" It was later brought to light by paleontologists Lars Ramskold and Hou Xianguang that Conway Morris' reconstruction was inverted upside down, and likely belonged to the modern phylum \"Onychophora\".\n\nThe ultimate theme of the book is still being debated among evolutionary biologists today.\n\n\n"}
