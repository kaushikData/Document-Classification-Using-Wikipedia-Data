{"id": "5640210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5640210", "title": "Aban", "text": "Aban\n\nApas (, ) is the Avestan language term for \"the waters\", which, in its innumerable aggregate states, is represented by the Apas, the hypostases of the waters. \n\n\"Āb\" (plural \"Ābān\") is the Middle Persian-language form.\n\n\"To this day reverence for water is deeply ingrained in Zoroastrians, and in orthodox communities offerings are regularly made to the household well or nearby stream.\" The \"ape zaothra\" ceremony—the culminating rite of the \"Yasna\" service (which is in turn the principal act of worship)—is literally for the \"strengthening of the waters.\"\n\nAvestan \"apas\" (from singular \"āpō\") is grammatically feminine, and the Apas are female. The Middle Persian equivalents are \"ābān\"/Ābān (alt: \"āvān\"/Āvān), from which Parsi Gujarati \"āvā\"/Āvā (in religious usage only) derive.\n\nThe Avestan common noun \"āpas\" corresponds exactly to Vedic Sanskrit \"\", and both derive from the same proto-Indo-Iranian word, stem \"*ap-\" \"water\", cognate with the British river Avon. In both Avestan and Vedic Sanskrit texts, the waters—whether as waves or drops, or collectively as streams, pools, rivers or wells—are represented by the Apas, the group of divinities of the waters. The identification of divinity with element is complete in both cultures : in the RigVeda the divinities are wholesome to drink, in the Avesta the divinities are good to bathe in.\n\nAs also in the Indian religious texts, the waters are considered a primordial element. In Zoroastrian cosmogony, the waters are the second creation, after that of the sky. Aside from Apas herself/themselves, no less than seven Zoroastrian divinities are identified with the waters: All three Ahuras (Mazda, Mithra, Apam Napat), two Amesha Spentas (Haurvatat, Armaiti) and two lesser Yazatas (Aredvi Sura Anahita and Ahurani).\n\nAbans, a crater on Ariel, one of the moons of Uranus, is named after \"aban\".\n\nIn the seven-chapter \"Yasna Haptanghaiti\", which interrupts the sequential order of the Gathas and is linguistically as old as the Gathas themselves, the waters are revered as the \"Ahuranis\", wives of the Ahura (\"Yasna\" 38.3). Although not otherwise named, Boyce associates this Ahura with \"Apam Napat\" (middle Persian: Burz Yazad), another divinity of waters.\n\nIn \"Yasna\" 38, which is dedicated \"to the earth and the sacred waters\", \"apas\"/Apas is not only necessary for nourishment, but is considered the source of life (\"you that bear forth\", \"mothers of our life\"). In \"Yasna\" 2.5 and 6.11, \"apas\"/Apas is \"Mazda-made and holy\".\n\nIn the \"Aban Yasht\" (\"Yasht\" 5), which is nominally dedicated to the waters, veneration is directed specifically at \"Aredvi Sura Anahita\", another divinity identified with the waters, but originally representing the \"world river\" that encircled the earth (see \"In tradition\", below). The merger of the two concepts \"probably\" came about due to prominence given to Aredvi Sura during the reign of Artaxerxes II (\"r.\" 404-358 BCE) and subsequent Achaemenid emperors. Although (according to Lommel and Boyce) Aredvi is of Indo-Iranian origin and cognate with Vedic Saraswati, during the 5th century BCE Aredvi was conflated with a Semitic divinity with similar attributes, from whom she then inherited additional properties.\n\nIn other Avesta texts, the waters are implicitly associated with \"[Spenta] Armaiti\" (middle Persian \"Spendarmad\"), the Amesha Spenta of the earth (this association is properly developed in \"Bundahishn\" 3.17). In \"Yasna\" 3.1, the eminence of \"Aban\" is reinforced by additionally assigning guardianship to another Amesha Spenta \"Haurvatat\" (middle Persian: \"(K)hordad\").\n\nAccording to the \"Bundahishn\", ('Original Creation', an 11th- or 12th-century text), \"aban\" was the second of the seven creations of the material universe, the lower half of everything.\n\nIn a development of a cosmogonical view already alluded to in the \"Vendidad\" (21.15), \"aban\" is the essence of a \"great gathering place of the waters\" (Avestan: \"Vourukasha\", middle Persian: \"Varkash\") upon which the world ultimately rested. The great sea was fed by a mighty river (proto-Indo-Iranian: \"*harahvati\", Avestan: \"Aredvi Sura\", middle Persian: \"Ardvisur\"). Two rivers, one to the east and one to the west, flowed out of it and encircled the earth (\"Bundahishn\" 11.100.2, 28.8) where they were then cleansed by \"Puitika\" (Avestan, middle Persian: \"Putik\"), the tidal sea, before flowing back into the \"Vourukasha\". \n\nIn the Zoroastrian calendar, the tenth day of the month is dedicated to the (divinity of) waters (\"Siroza\" 1.10), under whose protection that day then lies. Additionally, \"Aban\" is also the name of the eighth month of the year of the Zoroastrian calendar (\"Bundahishn\" 1a.23-24), as well as that of the Iranian calendar of 1925, which follows Zoroastrian month-naming conventions. It might be the precursor of the holy month of Sha'aban in the Hijri calendar.\nsha'aban meaning\nThe Zoroastrian name-day feast of \"Abanagan\", also known as the \"Aban Ardvisur Jashan\" by Indian Zoroastrians (see: Parsis), is celebrated on the day that the day-of-month and month-of-year dedications intersect, that is, on the tenth day of the eighth month. The celebration is accompanied by a practice of offering sweets and flowers to a river or the sea.\n\nFrom among the flowers associated with the yazatas, \"aban\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s is the water-lily (\"Bundahishn\" 27.24).\n\n\n\n"}

Simonides said that she had acted as arbitrator between Hephaestus and Demeter respecting the possession of Sicily. By Zeus or Hephaestus she became the mother of the Palici.

Because the reliable record for the Southern Ocean is short (since the early 1980s) and signal processing is needed to reveal its existence, some climatologists doubt the existence of the wave. Others accept its existence but say that it varies in strength over decades.\n\nThe wave was discovered simultaneously by and .

All these are hilly areas climbing sometimes to steep barren mountain up to 1500m, and which still have a number of cirque glaciers. The climate varies of course from the coast to the icy peaks.\n\nThe slopes are covered with a variety of lichens and other tundra plants, depending on altitude and drainage. The low-lying, wetter areas are similar to the surrounding Beringia lowland tundra ecoregion but the uplands are generally drier and dominated by sedges such as Eriophorum vaginatum and scrub such as the ericas Arctostaphylos alpina, Vaccinium vitis-idaea or Empetrum nigrum or mountain-avens (Dryas octopetala) and dwarf arctic birch (Betula nana). Sheltered valleys will have some spruce or poplar trees picea glauca and populus balsamifera. The Seward Peninsula is vulnerable to fire when the lichens dry out in summer \n\nBirds of this coast include the rare shorebird bristle-thighed curlew (Numenius tahitiensis) which breeds only in Alaska, spectacled eider (Somateria fishceri), a number of turnstones (Arenaria spp.), and in the river valleys blackpoll warblers (Dendroica striata). The cliffs of the Seward Peninsula and St. Lawrence Island in particular are nesting sites for a variety of seabirds including common murre and thick-billed murre (Uria aalge and Uria lomvia) and tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata)\n\nThe ecoregion also includes the Walrus Islands in Togiak Bay which as the name would suggest are home to Alaska's largest concentration of walrus in summer.\n\nThere are small human communities in the region, some mining on the Seward Peninsula and some possible over-hunting of caribou, but these are large blocks of largely unspoilt habitat. Protected areas include Wood-Tikchik State Park, Walrus Islands State Game Sanctuary, Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, and Togiak National Wildlife Refuge.\n"}

Most of Hong Kong's parks have natural diversity, usually containing over 1,000 species of plants\n\nTo conserve and, where appropriate, open up the countryside for the greater enjoyment of the population, the Country Parks Ordinance was enacted in 1976 to provide a legal framework for the designation, development and management of Country Parks and Special Areas. It provides for the establishment of a Country and Marine Parks Board to advise the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation who, as Country and Marine Parks Authority, is responsible for all matters on Country Parks and Special Areas.\n\nA total of 24 country parks have been designated. The country parks and special areas cover a total area of 440  km².\nCountry Parks are designated for the purposes of nature conservation, countryside recreation and outdoor education. The country parks comprise scenic hills, woodlands, reservoirs and coastline in all parts of Hong Kong.\nThe parks include Tai Mo Shan, Pat Sin Leng mountain range, Ma On Shan, Lion Rock, Sai Kung Peninsula, forest plantations at Shing Mun and Tai Lam, Shek Lei Pui Reservoir group and Lantau Island. Several islands such as Ping Chau in Mirs Bay are included, and Hong Kong Island itself has six Country Parks.\nThe Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) manages the parks and is responsible for tree planting, litter collection, fire fighting, development control and provision of recreation and education facilities. The country parks are very popular with all sectors of the community and spending a day in a country park is accepted by many as one of the best recreational choices in town. About 13.5 million visitors were recorded in 2011 and most visitors engaged in leisure walking, fitness exercises, hiking, barbecuing, family picnics and camping.\n\nPark facilities provided in recreational sites include tables and benches, barbecue pits, litterbins, children's play apparatus, shelters, campsites and toilets – all carefully designed to blend in with the environment. Footpaths and family walks provide easy access to the hills and the woodlands for visitors to enjoy the scenic beauty of these areas. Major paths are being improved and way marked through the hilly terrain.\n\nThe four long-distance hiking trails are very popular among hikers:\n\nMore facilities are provided to help visitors to enjoy and understand the countryside. Visitor centres have been established at Aberdeen, Plover Cove, Sai Kung, Clear Water Bay, Shing Mun and Tai Mo Shan. The Lions Nature Education Centre at Tsiu Hang Special Area in Sai Kung is a special attraction to visitors as it consists of a rich collection of fruit-bearing and amenity trees, vegetables, rocks and minerals and other local vegetation. The Shing Mun Arboretum has a collection of about 300 plant species. Along nature trails and tree walks, there are on-site interpretative signs for those who wish to study nature. AFCD has also set up a website and a number of fax-on-demand lines to provide the public with information about country parks. Furthermore, community involved conservation programmes such as the Corporate Afforestation Scheme, School Visit Programme, Guided Walks and many other voluntary services have been organised. In 2004, more than 200,000 people participated in these conservation programmes.\n\nThe parks and the special areas contain a wide variety of vegetation, including native and introduced tree species such as camphor laurel \"(Cinnamomum camphora)\", \"Machilus\", \"Schima\", \"Acacia\", slash pine and Brisbane box. There are also animals such as barking deer, rhesus macaques, long-tailed macaques, wild boar, civet, pangolin, Chinese porcupine and squirrel; birds such as the greater coucal, great barbet, Chinese bulbul, crested mynah, spotted dove and black-eared kite; and a large variety of insects and about 240 species of butterflies. Over 500 bird nest boxes have been introduced into country parks to enhance the breeding of birds.\n\nThe Tai Po Kau Special Area is a 'Nature Reserve' and caters for those who wish to study tree, plant, bird and insect life, as well as providing pleasant and interesting walks. There is a total ban on the lighting of fires in this important woodland area. This is Hong Kong's best site for forest birding, with species including chestnut bulbul, scarlet and grey-throated minivets, orange-bellied leafbird, fork-tailed sunbird, and scarlet-backed flowerpecker. Several species that were certainly or probably escapees from captivity have become established here – for instance, velvet-fronted nuthatch, blue-winged minla and silver-eared mesia. Migrants occur here, especially during spring and autumn, and in winter; the globally near-threatened Japanese paradise-flycatcher occurs annually in small numbers.\n\nIncreasing emphasis is being given to facilities to help visitors to enjoy and understand the countryside. In this connection, six visitor centres have been established at Aberdeen, Plover Cove, Sai Kung, Clear Water Bay, Shing Mun and Tai Mo Shan. The Lions Nature Education Centre at Tsiu Hang Special Area in Sai Kung, consists of a rich collection of fruit-bearing and amenity trees, vegetables, rocks and minerals, and other local vegetation, has been established for the purpose of nature education. The Shing Mun Arboretum has a collection of about 300 plant species. Along nature trails and tree walks, there are on-site interpretative signs for those who wish to study the nature.\n\nFire is the major hazard and it bedevils park management for about six months every year. This is the time of the cool, dry winter when many people like to spend a day out in the hills-especially at weekends and public holidays. In a normal fire season there can be as many as 300 hill fires in the parks with five to seven fires a day when conditions are particularly bad. In 1986, a 34-hour blaze destroyed 282,500 trees at Shing Mun and Tai Mo Shan and ravaged 7.4 km² of countryside. Fire is the greatest threat to the country parks.\n\nLitter is another problem. One of the major tasks of park management is to collect litter left by the visitors which in 2001 totalled some 3,850 tonnes.\n\nWith such problems in mind, the Country and Marine Parks Authority has provided barbecue pits and litter bins located strategically throughout the park areas for the visitors. The Authority also prosecutes anyone found littering, damaging facilities or lighting fires outside the approved barbecue sites in the Country Parks.\n\nA number of management centres have been established in strategic locations within the Country Parks from which construction, maintenance and protection services are provided.\n\nSpecial Areas are created mainly for the purpose of nature conservation, inside or outside Country park.\n\nThe Marine Parks Ordinance protects and conserves the marine environment and a rich collection of aquatic animals and plants, such as corals, sea grasses and dolphins. The ordinance also provides the legal framework for the designation, control and management of marine parks and marine reserves. The Marine Parks and Marine Reserve Regulation provides for the prohibition and control of certain activities in marine parks and marine reserve.\n\nA wide variety of animal and plant life can be found in large areas of Hong Kong, especially in the New Territories. The Government's increasing concern with the protection of the natural environment has been demonstrated both by legislation and by the activities of its conservation staff. Game hunting is prohibited.\n\nAbout 38 per cent of land in Hong Kong has been designated as country parks and special areas which provide statutory protection for the habitats of our diverse flora and fauna. In addition, 67 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) have been listed to recognise the scientific importance of these sites and to ensure that due consideration to conservation is given when developments in or near these sites are proposed. For example, San Chau and Ngong Ping at Lantau have been listed as SSSIs in recognition of the presence of the largest population of Rhododendron championae and Romer's Tree Frog (Philautus romeri) in Hong Kong respectively. Tree Frogs normally appear in Hong Kong.\n\nThe flora of Hong Kong is diverse in character and surprisingly numerous in species. Many typical species of the Southeast Asian tropical flora are seen here at the limit of their northern distribution range. More than 3,100 species and varieties of vascular plants have been recorded in Hong Kong, approximately 2,100 of which are native and the rest are of exotic origin. Many species of plants in Hong Kong are noteworthy for the beauty or fragrance of their blossoms. Bauhinia blakeana (Hong Kong Orchid Tree) was discovered in 1908 at Pok Fu Lam. It is among the finest of the Bauhinia genus anywhere in the world. The flower of the bauhinia is prominently featured on the flag of Hong Kong. It is widely planted – being propagated by cuttings since its seeds are usually sterile.\n\nAFCD's Hong Kong Herbarium is responsible for the systematic collection, identification and curation of plant specimens of the Hong Kong flora. It plays a significant role in supporting the studies on taxonomy, ecology and conservation of Hong Kong flora. Established in 1878, it houses approximately 37,000 plant specimens and is equipped with a specialised library to support its function.\n\nEfforts have been made to conserve rare and endangered plant species. In addition to habitat protection, they are also conserved through the following approaches.\n\nLarger wild mammals are declining in numbers in Hong Kong, mainly because of the increased urbanisation. Civets, leopard cats and Chinese porcupines are seen occasionally at night in the New Territories. Indian muntjac (also called barking deer) are uncommon but are heard and seen in wooded areas. There are wild boars in some remote areas, occasionally causing damage to crops. Unlike others, rhesus macaques are easily seen in Kam Shan Country Park. Visitors are reminded not to feed these wild animals as uncontrolled feeding has led to unnatural growth of the monkey population and caused nuisances. A feeding ban has been implemented and enforced in the area since July 1999 to help the monkeys revert to forage natural food in the natural environment. Smaller mammals such as squirrels, the woodland shrew, house shrew and bats are common in rural areas. As of 2005, some 54 species of terrestrial mammals have been recorded in Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong is a major stopover point of Asia's migration routes for birds. The wide varieties of local habitats including wetlands, grasslands, woodlands, seashores, and farmlands contribute to the diversity of the birds. There are over 490 species of wild birds including residents, winter visitors, passage migrants, and summer visitors recorded in Hong Kong. Some of these are globally endangered species such as Black-faced Spoonbill. About 120 species have been recorded breeding in the territory. The Mai Po Marshes are listed as a restricted area and access is restricted to permit holders. This area of mudflat, mangrove and shrimp ponds is the richest habitat for migratory birds. More than 320 species of birds have been recorded in the area and about 120 of these are rarely seen elsewhere in the territory. The Marshes form part of the 15 km² Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar Site which was listed in 1995 as a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention. This area is also one of the participants of the East Asian – Australasian Shorebird Reserve Network.\n\nHong Kong has over 100 species of amphibians and reptiles. Among them, over 40 species are snakes. Most snakes in Hong Kong are harmless and there have been very few cases of known bites by highly venomous snakes. There are nine species of chelonians found in Hong Kong, of which the Green Turtle is of particular interest in that it is the only known species of sea turtles breeding locally. The nesting site of Green Turtles at Sham Wan of Lamma Island was designated a restricted area in 1999 to protect the species during the breeding season. Hong Kong has a total of 23 species of amphibians. Three of them, Hong Kong Cascade Frog, Hong Kong Newt and the endemic Romer's Tree Frog have been listed under the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance due to their rarity. A site that supports the largest population of the Romer's Tree Frog – part of Ngong Ping on Lantau Island, has also been designated as SSSI in May 1999.\n\nHong Kong has a rich insect fauna. At least 6,784 species has been recorded so far and 700 additional species are expected to be found. There are about 240 butterfly species, including the beautiful swallowtails and birdwings (\"Troides helena\" and \"Troides aeacus\"). Of over 2,000 moth species recorded, the Atlas moth (\"Attacus atlas\") is outstanding for its large size with wing span up to 30 centimetres, while the Chinese moon moth (\"Actias ningpoana\") is eye catching for its long hindwing tails. Endemic moth species include \"Athetis hongkongensis\", \"Ugia purpurea\", \"Athetis bispurca\" and \"Egira ambigua\". The dragonfly fauna is diverse, with over 110 species recorded, some of which are endemic to Hong Kong. Hong Kong also has 235 species of ants, 17 species of praying mantids, 31 species of cockroaches, 6 species of flea, 78 species of mosquitoes and 124 species of grasshoppers. 4,583 species are known to be plant eating (phytophagous) and over 1,000 species are beneficial insects either preying on or existing as parasites over other pests.\n\nThe marine fauna of Hong Kong is exceptionally diverse. Though primarily tropical, it is an admixture of tropical South China Sea and temperate Chinese forms because of the seasonal fluctuations of warm and cold water and monsoon weather conditions. Of an estimated 1,800 species of fish on the South China continental shelf, clupeoids, croakers and sea breams are the dominant groups in Hong Kong waters. Farther offshore, golden thread, big-eyes and others are also of high value to fishermen. Marine invertebrates are also abundant – ranging from corals, molluscs to crustaceans. There are 84 species of stony corals in Hong Kong. The richest coral communities prevail to the east of Hong Kong where the waters are both sheltered and free from the influence of Pearl River. Marine mammals, Chinese White Dolphin and Finless Porpoise, are resident species and can be found year-round. All cetaceans are protected in Hong Kong under the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance. There are more than 120 species of native freshwater fish recorded of which about 30 primary freshwater species spend their entire lives in freshwaters. Of the primary freshwater fish, cyprinids are dominant.\n\n"}

He promotes a variety of pseudoscientific ideas such as raw foodism, alternative medicine, and vaccine denialism.\n\nWolfe grew up in San Diego, California, graduated from University of California Santa Barbara, where he studied mechanical and environmental engineering and political science, then earned a law degree at the University of San Diego. According to Wolfe, he became intolerant of dairy when he was 18 and stopped consuming it, which led him to explore various diets and by the time he was 24 he was on an organic, raw food diet. He introduced the diet to Thor Bazler (then known as Stephen Arlin), who had attended the same high school as Wolfe, and this led to the founding of their company “Nature's First Law”.\n\nThor Bazler and Wolfe co-founded the company, \"Nature's First Law\" in 1995. The company sold organic food and products related to raw foodism. Wolfe and Bazler started the company selling products out of their car trunks; by 2005 the company had 23 employees and around $6 million in revenue, and had profits of $1.2 million in 2004. The company grew in part by endorsements from celebrities like Steve Jobs, Woody Harrelson, Alicia Silverstone, and Angela Bassett. By 2005 Wolfe had become an evangelist for raw foods, travelling and speaking, while Bazler stayed in San Diego and tended to the Nature's First Law business. In 2007 Nature's First Law changed its name to \"Sunfood Nutrition\". The relationship between Wolfe and Sunfood ended at least by 2011, and there was litigation involving personality rights. In 2012 Sunfood claimed Wolfe was defaming it.\n\nWhile affiliated with Sunfood Nutrition, Wolfe also co-founded the company \"Sacred Chocolate\" in 2006 with Steve Adler, which sells specialized raw chocolate products. \n\nNew Horizon Health, Inc. was founded in 2009 and runs websites and businesses for which Wolfe is the \"celebrity spokesperson\": the e-commerce site, \"Longevity Warehouse\", and the subscription-based longevity web magazine, \"The Best Day Ever\" that Wolfe says he co-founded. New Horizon Health had $7.6M in revenue in 2013.\n\nWolfe has been the spokesman for NutriBullet since its inception in 2012, and has appeared in several infomercials promoting the product. Wolfe has authored and co-authored several books promoting foods and offering diet advice.\n\nWolfe is president of the Fruit Tree Planting Foundation, which received its IRS nonprofit certification in 2002.\n\nIn 2004, Wolfe starred on the reality TV show \"Mad Mad House\" regularly as the naturist \"alt\", alternative lifestyle practitioners who served as hosts and judges for the contestant \"guests\". In 2004 Wolfe was part of a rock band called \"The Healing Waters\" that travelled the country in a vegetable-oil powered bus and performed songs including \"Raw Food Girl\" and \"Bye Bye Burger World\".\n\nWolfe has been criticized for promoting pseudoscience.\n\nWolfe has made statements about medical treatments that are not in keeping with the scientific and medical literature. In particular, Wolfe has stated that vaccines cause autism or otherwise harm or kill people and may not work. This claim has been discredited. Wolfe's anti-vaccination stance led to protests during a speaking tour of Australia in 2017, which had been funded in part by anti-vaccination groups. This led to the cancellation of a scheduled event after the withdrawal of a sponsor, and at least one more after a venue cancelled the booking. Wolfe also advocates that people with cancer treat it with dietary supplements and according to science writer Kavin Senapathy, he \"demonizes life-saving vaccines and cancer treatments\". \n\nIn regard to diet, Wolfe promotes a diet based on unprocessed foods, stating that this has a \"detoxification\" effect. Detoxification has been found to be unscientific and lacking in evidence. Furthermore, he has advertised deer antler spray as being \"levitational\" and an \"androgenic force.\" He also believes that gravity is toxic.\n\nOutside of medicine, Wolfe believes that chemtrails exist and that the Earth is flat.\n"}

The land mass position and cloud patterns in this image are the same as those of the color photograph entitled \"Earthrise\".\n\nThe photograph was taken from lunar orbit on December 24, 1968, 16:00 UTC, with a highly modified Hasselblad 500 EL with an electric drive. The camera had a simple sighting ring rather than the standard reflex viewfinder and was loaded with a 70 mm film magazine containing custom Ektachrome film developed by Kodak. Immediately prior, Anders had been photographing the lunar surface with a 250 mm lens; the lens was subsequently used for the \"Earthrise\" images. An audio recording of the event is available with transcription which allows the event to be followed closely – excerpt:\n\nThere were many images taken at that point. The mission audio tape establishes several photographs were taken, on Borman's orders, with the enthusiastic concurrence of Lovell and Anders. Anders took the first color shot, then Lovell who notes the setting (1/250th of a second at ), followed by Anders with another very similar shot (AS08-14-2384).\n\nA nearly full-page black and white reproduction of Borman's image may be viewed on page 164 of his 1988 autobiography, captioned, \"One of the most famous pictures in photographic history – taken after I grabbed the camera away from Bill Anders\". Borman was the mission commander and notes that this is the image \"the Postal Service used on a stamp, and few photographs have been more frequently reproduced\". The photograph reproduced in the Frank Borman autobiography is not the same image as the Anders photograph; aside from the orientation, the cloud patterns differ. Borman later recanted this story and agreed that the black and white shot was also taken by Anders, based on evidence presented by transcript and a video produced by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio employee, Ernie Wright.\n\nThe stamp issue reproduces the cloud, color, and crater patterns of the Anders picture. Anders is described by Borman as holding \"a masters degree in nuclear engineering\"; Anders was thus tasked as \"the scientific crew member ... also performing the photography duties that would be so important to the Apollo crew who actually landed on the Moon\".\n\nThe as-published photograph shows Earth:\n\nIn \"Life\"s \"100 Photographs that Changed the World\", wilderness photographer Galen Rowell called \"Earthrise\" \"the most influential environmental photograph ever taken\". Another author called its appearance the beginning of the environmental movement.\n\nIn October 2018, the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN) of the International Astronomical Union named one of the large craters seen in the photo \"Anders' Earthrise\". The crater had previously been designated only with letters.\n\nIn 1969, the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp (Scott# 1371) commemorating the Apollo 8 flight around the Moon. The stamp featured a detail (in color) of the \"Earthrise\" photograph, and the words, \"In the beginning God...\", recalling the Apollo 8 Genesis reading.\n\nOn April 6, 2008 (Japan Standard Time), the first 1080p high-definition Earthrise video was captured, both a full Earthrise and Earthset video, by the JAXA lunar orbiter mission, SELENE (better known in Japan by its nickname \"Kaguya\"). After successfully orbiting the Moon for 1 year and 8 months, it was crashed intentionally onto the lunar surface at 18:25 UTC on June 10, 2009.\n\nIn 2013, in commemoration of the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 8 mission, NASA issued a video about the taking of the photograph. This computer-generated visualization used data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, which had provided detailed images of the lunar surface that could be matched with those taken every 20 seconds by an automatic camera on Apollo 8. The resulting video, re-creating what the astronauts would have seen, was synchronized with the recording of the crew's conversation as they became the first humans to witness an Earthrise. The video included explanatory narration written and read by Andrew Chaikin. Chaikin writes that all the photographs of the rising earth on Apollo 8's fourth orbit were taken by Anders.\n\nThe Earth \"rose\" because the spacecraft was traveling over the Moon's surface. An earthrise that might be witnessed from the \"surface\" of the Moon would be quite unlike moonrises on Earth. Because the Moon is tidally locked with the Earth, one side of the Moon always faces toward Earth. Interpretation of this fact would lead one to believe that the Earth's position is fixed on the lunar sky and no earthrises can occur; however, the Moon librates slightly, which causes the Earth to draw a Lissajous figure on the sky. This figure fits inside a rectangle 15°48' wide and 13°20' high (in angular dimensions), while the angular diameter of the Earth as seen from Moon is only about 2°. This means that earthrises are visible near the edge of the Earth-observable surface of the Moon (about 20% of the surface). Since a full libration cycle takes about 27 days, earthrises are very slow, and it takes about 48 hours for Earth to clear its diameter. During the course of the month-long lunar orbit, an observer would additionally witness a succession of \"Earth phases\", much like the lunar phases seen from Earth. That is what accounts for the half-illuminated globe seen in the photograph.\n\n\n"}

Production in 2002 was estimated at 30 GWh, while consumption was placed at 25 GWh. However, poor management and aging equipment has resulted in prolonged power blackouts. As a result, small gasoline and diesel-powered generators are used as backup power sources. In October 2012 the Djibloho Dam was inaugurated, which added 120 MW to the national generating capacity.\n\nThe total installed generating capacity in 2014 was an estimated 200 MW; electricity production in 2014 was estimated at 98 Mio. kWh. Electricity is provided by the national electricity company SEGESA.\n\nSince 1995, when significant off shore oil discoveries were made in the Gulf of Guinea, oil has become Equatorial Guinea's most important export. , according to World Oil, Equatorial Guinea's proven oil reserves were put at .

{"id": "9425201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9425201", "title": "Energy policy of Kazakhstan", "text": "Energy policy of Kazakhstan\n\nKazakhstan owns large reserves of energy resources, and therefore the energy policy of Kazakhstan has influence over the world's overall energy supply. Although Kazakhstan has not described itself as an energy superpower, Kazakhstan's president Nursultan Nazarbayev has claimed Kazakhstan will become a factor of energy security in Asia and Europe. Kazakhstan has a strategic geographical location to control oil and gas flows from Central Asia to East (China) and West (Russia, global market).\n\nKazakhstan was a partner country of the EU INOGATE energy programme, which had four key topics: enhancing energy security,\nconvergence of member state energy markets on the basis of EU internal energy market principles,\nsupporting sustainable energy development, and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest.\n\nOn January 1, 2013, Kazakhstan became the first country in Central Asia to launch an economy-wide carbon emissions system to cap emissions from its biggest emitters in the energy, coal, oil and gas extraction sectors.\n\nThe Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources was the responsible governmental agency for energy policies until March 2010 when it was dissolved and replaced by the Ministry of Oil and Gas and the Ministry for Industry and New Technologies.\n\nIn June 2003, the government of Kazakhstan announced a new Caspian Sea development program, according to which new offshore blocks of oil and gas to be auctioned. In 2005, the government introduced new restrictions granting to the state-owned oil and gas company KazMunayGas status of contractor and at least half of any production sharing agreement (PSA). New tax structure, enforced in January 2004, included a so-called \"rent tax\" on exports, a progressive tax that increases as oil prices grow. The amendment raised the government's share of oil income to a range of 65-85%.The new structure includes an excess profit tax, and limits foreign participation to 50 percent in each offshore project with no guarantees of operatorship.\n\nIn 2005, Kazakhstan amended the subsoil law to preempt the sale of oil assets in the country and to extend the government’s power to buy back energy assets by limiting the transfer of property rights to strategic assets in Kazakhstan.\n\nKazakhstan projects to inject 9.4 trillion tenge to prop up its power sector until 2030. Some 5.5 trillion tenge will be directed to power generation, 1.4 trillion to the national power grid and 2.5 trillion tenge to regional power distribution companies. The draft published in October 2012 provides for creating a unified power system, reducing environmental stress, increasing the share of renewable energy sources in Kazakhstan's power generation and introducing energy-efficient technologies.\n\nIn 2013, Kazakhstan adopted the Energy Efficiency 2020 Program that would reduce emission 10% every year until 2015. Adopted by Prime Minister Serik Akhmetov, this new law would help reduce emissions and help with energy efficient solutions from large companies to small families. 2,000 industrial enterprises would be energy audits to meet with the new law. The program in the long run reduces the amount of energy per square meter by 30% and reduce costs by 14%.\n\nKazakhstan oil, gas, coal and uranium reserves are among the ten biggest in the world.\n\nKazakhstan is estimated to have around of crude oil reserves, which place it eleventh in the world. In 2000s, the oil production has increased rapidly due to foreign investment and improvements in production efficiencies. In 2006, Kazakhstan produced 54 million tons of crude oil and 10.5 million tons of gas condensate , which makes Kazakhstan eighteenth-largest oil producer in the world. At these production levels Kazakhstan is thought to have approximately 50 years of remaining production. According to the president Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan is planning to increase its oil production up to of oil a day, of which 3 million will go to export. This will lift Kazakhstan into the ranks of the world's top 10 oil-producing nations.\n\nThe main production sites are the Tengiz field , located on the northeast shores of the Caspian, and the Karachaganak field , located inland near to Russian border. In future Kazakh oil production will also rely on the Kashagan field, the largest oil field outside the Middle East, which possess anywhere from to in recoverable reserves, and the Kurmangazy field in Northern Kazakhstan. There are some smaller oil fields near the Chinese border, which are not developed/operational yet. 76% of Kazakhstan's oil and gas production and remaining reserves are concentrated in these three oil fields, as well as the Uzen Field. 14% of reserves and production are located in 6 further fields.\n\nThe leading oil industry is state-owned oil company KazMunayGas. The landmark foreign investment in Kazakh oil industry is the TengizChevroil joint venture, owned 50% by ChevronTexaco, 25% by ExxonMobil, 20% by the Government of Kazakhstan, and 5% by Lukarco of Russia. The Karachaganak natural gas and gas condensate field is being developed by BG, Agip, ChevronTexaco, and Lukoil. Also Chinese, Indian and Korean oil companies are involved in the Kazakhstan's oil industry.\n\nKazakhstan has three oil refineries: in Pavlodar, in Atyrau, and in Shymkent. Pavlodar and Shymkent refineries process West Siberian crude oil, which is imported through the Omsk (Russia) - Pavlodar (Kazakhstan) - Shymkent - Türkmenabat (Turkmenistan) pipeline.\n\nKazakhstan's domestic hydrocarbon reserves amount to 3.3–3.7 trillion cubic metres of gas, of which 2.5 tcm are proven. However, Kazakhstan became a net gas exporter only in 2003. In 2007, Kazakhstan produced 29 bcm of natural gas and plans to increase its gas output to 60-80 bcm a year by 2015. The major natural gas fields are Karachaganak, Tengiz, Kashagan, Amangeldy, Zhanazhol, Urikhtau and Chinarevskoye. Kazakhstan's major gas company is KazMunaiGaS JSC that has a reported annual income of about $3 billion in 2013.\n\nAlthough Kazakhstan is a substantial producer of oil and gas, coal has dominated both energy production and consumption. It contains Central Asia's largest recoverable coal reserves, with 34.5 billion short tons of mostly anthracitic and bituminous coal. Major coal fields are Bogatyr and Severny. In 2005, Kazakhstan was the 9th biggest producer of coal in the world, and the 10th global exporter. Russia is the largest importer of Kazakh coal, followed by Ukraine. The biggest coal production company is Bogatyr Access Komir, which accounts for approximately 35% of Kazakh coal output.\n\nKazakhstan is the number one country in the world for uranium production volumes, and it owns the world second biggest uranium reserves after Australia (around 1.5 million tons or nearly 19% of the explored reserves of uranium in the world). In 2012 Kazakhstan produced 20,900 metric tons of uranium, of which 11,900 metric tons were produced by Kazatomprom, a state-owned holding company (2011: 19,450 total / 11,079 Kazatomprom). Kazatomprom also represents Kazakhstan in the joint ventures with Russian Tekhsnabexport, French AREVA and Canadian Cameco.\n\nAll of produced uranium is going for export as the country's only nuclear power plant in Aktau was shut down in June 1999. There is a plan to build a new 1,500 MW nuclear plant in the southeast of Kazakhstan, near Lake Balkash.\n\nAccording to the mayor, Kyzylorda is planning to produce two-thirds of Kazakhstan's uranium by 2015.\n\nIn 2014, Kazakhstan and the IAEA will sign an agreement to establish a low-enriched uranium fuel bank. The bank will be a place for countries to contribute uranium and disperse it to other nations safely for energy means with the IAEA being the governing body.\n\nIn August 2013, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano visited Kazakhstan to further discussions on the fuel bank and praised Kazakhstan's contribution to nuclear non-proliferation.\n\nIn 2012, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during a meeting with Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Erlan Idrissov in Washington, \"We view Kazakhstan not only as a regional player, but also as a global leader. Few countries can be compared to Kazakhstan in terms of its experience in non-proliferation.\"\n\nKazakhstan announced in January 2017 that the country was planning to cut its production of uranium by 10% due to a global oversupply of the commodity. According to Kazatomprom, state-owned uranium company and global production leader, even with the announced output cuts, Kazakhstan will continue to be the world’s No.1 uranium producer.\n\nThe Law on Electricity was adopted in July 2004. Another basic act regulating electricity market is the Law on Natural Monopolies, which was last amended in December 2004. The market regulator is the Agency for Regulation of Natural Monopolies (ANMR).\n\nKazakhstan's electricity system includes 71 power plants with total installed capacity of 18,572 MW. the largest power plant is a coal-fired AES Ekibastuz GRES-2 in north-central Kazakhstan.\n\n86.5% of electric power generation has been privatized. The government does not regulate prices for electricity, and consumers have free choice among providers of electric power (currently there is 15 licensed electricity traders). Transmission system is owned and operated by the state-owned company KEGOC. As of 1 January 2006, the total length of transmission lines was 23,383 km. There are 18 regional distribution (sale) companies. Government regulates transmission and distribution tariffs.\n\nKazakhstan possesses 5 operational hydroelectric plants which provide roughly 12% of the electricity generation. The majority of the facilities are located on the Irtysh River. Other renewables are largely undeveloped although Kazakhstan has potential in renewable energy resources. Renewable energy sources could be particularly attractive in isolated rural areas.\n\nKazakhstan currently has no nuclear power generation capacity, as the Aktau nuclear reactor, the country's only nuclear power plant, was shut down in June 1999. However, there is currently a plan to build a new 1,500 MW nuclear plant in the southeast of Kazakhstan, near Lake Balkash.\n\nKazakhstan's oil pipeline system is operated by KazTransOil which was formed in 1997 when the two previous oil pipeline companies were combined. It is owed 100% by KazMunaiGaz which is also the owner of KazTransGaz which along with KazRosGaz are the two principle gas transportation companies. KazRosGaz is a joint venture between KazMunaiGaz and Gazprom which is involved in the export and trade of gas with Russia.\n\nMain oil export routes are the Caspian Pipeline Consortium and the Atyrau-Samara oil pipeline to Russia, and Kazakhstan-China oil pipeline to China. Kazakhstan is also a transit country for the Omsk (Russia) -Pavlodar (Kasakhstan) -Shymkent - Türkmenabat (Turkmenistan) pipeline. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and Neka in Iran could be supplied by oil tankers. In addition, for the export to neighboring countries the rail transport is used.\n\nThe Kazakhstan oil infrastructure is considered to be in poor condition which has constrained possible exports. Currently exports excluding the Caspian Pipeline Consortium is limited to . Kazakhstan is also further hampered as the oil pipeline infrastructure is not set up to transport oil from the producing assets in the west to the main refineries located in the east of the country. The CPC provides an important outlet for Kazakhstan oil and it is expected that it will be up graded so as to export close to .\n\nThe natural gas trunk pipeline system stretches 10,138 kilometers. The major transit pipelines are the Central Asia-Center gas pipeline system and the Bukhara-Urals pipeline, which transport natural gas from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to Russia, and Orenburg-Novopskov pipeline and Soyuz pipeline from Orenburg processing plant to Europe. The Gazli-Bishkek pipeline transports natural gas from Uzbekistan to Kyrgyzstan. The Central Asia-Center and the Bukhara-Urals pipelines as also the Bukhara-Tashkent-Bishkek-Almaty pipeline are also main import pipelines. The main gas export goes to Orenburg processing plant in Russia. The export to Russia goes also through the Central Asia-Center and the Bukhara-Urals pipelines. There is plan to build a natural gas pipeline to China. To supply this pipeline, the Ishim (Rudny)-Petropavlovsk-Kokshetau-Astana pipeline is planned.\n\nIn general, various international organizations have played an important role in advising and assisting Kazakhstan's government in its energy sector reform and natural resource management.\n\nOn 4 December 2006, Kazakhstan and the European Union signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which sets the framework for deeper energy cooperation. The memorandum establishes road maps on energy security and industrial cooperation. It was accompanied by a co-operation agreement to develop nuclear trade.\n\nKazakhstan and Russia have close cooperation on energy issues. On 3 October 2006 during the presidents' meeting in Oral, Kazakhstan and Russia agreed to set up a gas-condensate-processing joint venture between Gazprom and KazMunayGas in Orenburg, which will be supplied from the Karachaganak field. The gas supply agreement was signed on 10 May 2007 in Astana.\n\nOn 7 December 2006, the Kazakhstan's Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Baktykozha Izmukhambetov and the chief of the Russian Federal Atomic Energy Agency Sergei Kiriyenko signed an agreement, in which Russia pledged to assist Kazakhstan in its nuclear program in return for shipments of uranium from Kazakhstan to Russia, where the uranium will be enriched. In addition, President of Kazatomprom Moukhtar Dzhakishev, and director of Russian uranium trader Tekhsnabexport Vladimir Smirnov signed a deal in which Tekhsnabexport will provide information regarding construction, transportation and logistics to help Kazakhstan develop its nuclear program. Russia already agreed earlier in 2006 to help Kazakhstan build two nuclear power plants. On 10 May 2007, Russia and Kazakhstan agreed to set up an international uranium enrichment center in Angarsk, East Siberia. The center is planned to come on stream in 2013.\n\nOn 12 May 2007, Vladimir Putin of Russia, Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow of Turkmenistan signed an agreement providing for Central Asian gas to be exported to Europe through the reconstructed and expanded western branch of the Central Asia-Center gas pipeline system.\n\nOn October 17, 2013 the International Board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) designated Kazakhstan “EITI Compliant”.\n\nClare Short, Chair of the EITI Board said, “Kazakhstan has reached an important milestone by becoming a full member of the EITI family. I hope that all parties will now work to ensure that this increase in transparency will lead to reform in the management of the extractive industires, bringing real benefits to the people of Kazakhstan and providing leadership in other countries in the region.”\n\nKazakhstan and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) cooperated on several projects related to nuclear energy, agriculture, nuclear security, research, and others. Kazakhstan contributed to such projects of the IAEA as the development of nuclear power infrastructure and strengthening nuclear forensics. Kazakhstan also provided US $100 000 in extrabudgetary contributions for the renovation of the IAEA’s nuclear applications research laboratories.\n\nOn August 27, 2015 the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Kazakhstan signed an agreement to set up the IAEA Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) Bank in Oskemen, Kazakhstan. The IAEA LEU Bank, operated by Kazakhstan, will be a physical reserve of LEU available for eligible IAEA Member States.\n\n\n"}

It was launched from Johnston Island on a Redstone missile. On 1 August 1958, the 3.8 Mt shot detonated at an altitude of 76.8 km.\n\nAlong with HARDTACK-Orange it was one of the two largest high-altitude nuclear explosions.\n\nThe 3.8 megaton detonation was planned to occur at an altitude of 250,000 feet approximately six miles south of Johnston Island. However, due to a programming failure it burst directly over the island at the desired elevation making the island the effective ground-zero. This brought the explosion 2,000 feet (approximately 2/5ths of a mile) nearer than intended to the launch site control and analysis crews.\n\nThe \"Teak\" test was originally planned to be launched from Bikini Atoll, but Lewis Strauss, chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission opposed the test because of fears that the flash from the nighttime detonation might blind Islanders who were living on nearby atolls. He finally agreed to approve the high-altitude test on the condition that the launch point be moved from Bikini Atoll to the more remote site at Johnston Island.\n\nAccording to the United States Defense Nuclear Agency report (DNA6038F) on Operation Hardtack I:\n\nWhen the warhead burst at directly above Johnston Island, the flash effectively turned night into day, as shown in the image to the right. The initial glow faded over a period of about 30 seconds. The thermal radiation output of the explosion was such that observers were forced to take cover in the \"shade\" for the first few moments, as can be seen in film footage of the test.\n\n\"Teak\" caused communications impairment over a widespread area in the Pacific basin. This was due to the injection of a large quantity of fission debris into the ionosphere. The debris prevented normal ionospheric reflection of high-frequency (HF) radio waves back towards Earth, which disrupted most long-distance HF radio communications. The nuclear detonation occurred at 10:50 UTC on 1 August 1958 (which was 11:50 p.m., Johnston Island local time, on 31 July 1958).\n\nAccording to the book \"Defense's Nuclear Agency 1947–1997\", when the \"Teak\" detonation occurred:\n\nAccording to page 269 of the Defense Nuclear Agency report on Operation Hardtack:\n\nAccording to civilian observer reports contained in the official United States Defense Nuclear Agency report on Operation Hardtack I:\n\n"}

The books cover what was known of the \"natural sciences\" at the time, including what would now be called material science, physics, chemistry and technology as well as the natural history of animals.\n\nThe \"Histoire Naturelle, générale et particulière, avec la description du Cabinet du Roi\" is the work that the Comte de Buffon (1707–1788) is remembered for. He worked on it for some 50 years, initially at Montbard in his office in the Tour Saint-Louis, then in his library at Petit Fontenet. 36 volumes came out between 1749 and 1789, followed by 8 more after his death, thanks to Bernard Germain de Lacépède. It includes all the knowledge available in his time on the \"natural sciences\", a broad term that includes disciplines which today would be called material science, physics, chemistry and technology. Buffon notes the morphological similarities between men and apes, although he considered apes completely devoid of the ability to think, differentiating them sharply from human beings. Buffon's attention to internal anatomy made him an early comparative anatomist. \"L’intérieur, dans les êtres vivants, est le fond du dessin de la nature\", he wrote in his \"Quadrupèdes,\" \"the interior, in living things, is the foundation of nature's design.\"\n\nThe \"Histoire Naturelle\", which was meant to address the whole of natural history, actually covers only minerals, birds, and the quadrupeds among animals. It is accompanied by some discourses and a theory of the earth by way of introduction, and by supplements including an elegantly written account of the epochs of nature.\n\nThe \"Suppléments\" cover a wide range of topics; for example, in (Suppléments IV), there is a \"Discours sur le style\" (Discourse on Style) and an \"Essai d'arithmétique morale\" (essay on Moral Arithmetic).\n\nLouis Jean-Marie Daubenton assisted Buffon on the quadrupeds; Philippe Guéneau de Montbeillard worked on the birds. They were joined, from 1767, by Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond, the abbot Gabriel Bexon and Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt. The whole descriptive and anatomical part of \"l’Histoire des Quadrupèdes\" was the work of Daubenton and Jean-Claude Mertrud.\nBuffon attached much importance to the illustrations; Jacques de Sève illustrated the quadrupeds and François-Nicolas Martinet illustrated the birds. Nearly 2000 plates adorn the work, representing animals with care given both to aesthetics and anatomical accuracy, with dreamlike and mythological settings.\n\nOn minerals, Buffon collaborated with André Thouin. Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond and Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau provided sources for the mineral volumes.\n\nL’\"Histoire Naturelle\" met immense success, almost as great as \"Encyclopédie\" by Diderot, which came out in the same period. The first three volumes of \"L’Histoire Naturelle, générale et particulière, avec la description du cabinet du Roi\" were reprinted three times in six weeks.\n\nThe encyclopaedia appeared in 36 volumes :\n\n\"L’Histoire Naturelle\" was initially printed at the Imprimerie royale in 36 volumes (1749–1789). In 1764 Buffon bought back the rights to his work. It was continued by Bernard Germain de Lacépède, who described the egg-laying quadrupeds, snakes, fishes and cetaceans in 8 volumes (1788–1804).\n\nBuffon was assisted in the work by Jacques-François Artur (1708–1779), Gabriel Léopold Charles Amé Bexon (1748–1785), Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton (1716–1799), Edme-Louis Daubenton (1732–1786), Jacques de Sève (actif 1742–1788), Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond (1741–1819), Philippe Guéneau de Montbeillard (1720–1785), Louis-Bernard Guyton-Morveau (1737–1816), Bernard Germain de Lacépède (1756–1825), François-Nicolas Martinet (1731–1800), the anatomist Jean-Claude Mertrud (1728–1802), Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt (1751–1812), and André Thouin (1747–1823).\n\nEach group is introduced with a general essay. This is followed by an article, sometimes of many pages, on each animal (or other item). The article on the wolf begins with the claim that it is one of the animals with a specially strong appetite for flesh; it asserts that the animal is naturally coarse and cowardly (\"grossier et poltron\"), but becoming crafty at need, and hardy by necessity, driven by hunger. The language, as in this instance, is elegant and elaborate, even \"flowery and ornate\". Buffon was roundly criticised by his fellow academics for writing a \"purely popularizing work, empty and puffed up, with little real scientific value\".\n\nThe species is named in Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, German, English, Swedish, and Polish. The zoological descriptions of the species by Gessner, Ray, Linnaeus, Klein and Buffon himself (\"\"Canis ex griseo flavescens. Lupus vulgaris\". Buffon. \"Reg. animal. pag. 235\"\") are cited.\n\nThe text is written as a continuous essay, without the sections on identification, distribution and behaviour that might have been expected from other natural histories. Parts concern human responses rather than the animal itself, as for example that the wolf likes human flesh, and the strongest wolves sometimes eat nothing else. Measurements may be included; in the case of the wolf, 41 separate measurements are tabulated, in pre-revolutionary French feet and inches starting with the \"Length of the whole body measured in a straight line from the end of the muzzle to the anus...3 feet. 7 inches.\" (1.2 m); the \"Length of the largest claws\" is given as \"10 lines\" (2.2 cm).\n\nThe wolf is illustrated standing in farmland, and as a complete skeleton standing on a stone plinth in a landscape. The account of the species occupies 32 pages including illustrations.\n\nThe original edition of the \"Histoire Naturelle\" by Buffon comprised 36 volumes in quarto, divided into the following series: Histoire de la Terre et de l'Homme, Quadrupèdes, Oiseaux, Minéraux, Suppléments. Buffon edited 35 volumes in his lifetime. Soon after his death, the fifth and final volume of \"l’Histoire des minéraux\" appeared in 1788 at the \"Imprimerie des Bâtiments du Roi\". The seventh and final volume of \"Suppléments\" by Buffon was published posthumously in 1789 through Lacépède's hands. Lacépède continued the part of the \"Histoire Naturelle\" which dealt with animals. A few months before Buffon's death, en 1788, Lacépède published, as a continuation, the first volume of his \"Histoire des Reptiles\", on egg-laying quadrupeds. The next year, he wrote a second volume on snakes, published during the French Revolution. Between 1798 and 1803, he brought out the volume \"Histoire des Poissons\". Lacépède made use of the notes and collections left by Philibert Commerson (1727–1773). He wrote \"Histoire des Cétacés\" which was printed in 1804. At that point, the \"Histoire Naturelle\", by Buffon and Lacépède, thus contained 44 quarto volumes forming the definitive edition.\n\nAnother edition in quarto format was printed by the \"Imprimerie royale\" in 36 volumes (1774–1804). It consisted of 28 volumes par Buffon, and 8 volumes by Lacépède. The part containing anatomical articles by Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton was dropped. The supplements were merged into the relevant articles in the main volumes.\n\nThe \"Imprimerie royale\" also published two editions of the \"Histoire Naturelle\" in duodecimo format (1752–1805), occupying 90 or 71 volumes, depending on whether or not they included the part on anatomy. In this print format, the original work by Buffon occupied 73 volumes with the part on anatomy, or 54 volumes without the part on anatomy. The continuation by Lacépède took up 17 duodecimo volumes.\n\nA de luxe edition of \"Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux\" (Birds) (1771–1786) was produced by the \"Imprimerie royale\" in 10 folio and quarto volumes, with 1008 engraved and hand-coloured plates, executed under Buffon's personal supervision by Edme-Louis Daubenton, cousin and brother-in-law of Buffon's principal collaborator.\n\nThe \"Histoire Naturelle\" was translated into languages including English, German, Swedish, Russian and Italian. Many translations, often partial (single volumes, or all volumes to a certain date), abridged, reprinted in the same translation by different printers, or with additional text (for example on insects) and new illustrations, were made at the end of the eighteenth century and the start of the nineteenth century, presenting a complicated publication history. Early translations were necessarily only of the earlier volumes. Given the complexity, all catalogue dates other than of single volumes should be taken as approximate.\n\nR. Griffith published an early translation of the volume on \"The Horse\" in London in 1762. T. Bell published a translation of the first six volumes in London between 1775 and 1776. William Creech published an edition in Edinburgh between 1780 and 1785. T. Cadell and W. Davies published another edition in London in 1812. An abridged edition was published by Wogan, Byrne et al. in Dublin in 1791; that same year R. Morison and Son of Perth, J. and J. Fairbairn of Edinburgh and T. Kay and C. Forster of London published their edition. W. Strahan and T. Cadell published a translation with notes by the encyclopaedist William Smellie in London around 1785. \"Barr's Buffon\" in ten volumes was published in London between 1797 and 1807. W. Davidson published an abridged version including the natural history of insects taken from Swammerdam, Brookes, Goldsmith et al., with \"elegant engravings on wood\"; its four volumes appeared in Alnwick in 1814.\n\nGerman translations include those published by Joseph Georg Trassler 1784–1785; by Pauli, 1772–1829; Grund and Holle, 1750–1775; and Johann Samuel Heinsius, 1756–1782.\n\nItalian translations include those published by Fratelle Bassaglia around 1788 and Boringherieri in 1959.\n\nPer Olof Gravander translated an 1802–1803 French abridgement into Swedish, publishing it in Örebro in 1806–1807.\n\nA Russian version (The General and Particular Natural History by Count Buffon; \"Всеобщая и частная естественная история графа Бюффона\") was brought out by The Imperial Academy of Sciences (Императорской Академией Наук) in St. Petersburg between 1789 and 1808.\n\nAn abridged edition for children was published by Frederick Warne in London and Scribner, Welford and Co. c. 1870.\n\nThe original edition was arranged as follows:\n\nNatural history, and description of the king's cabinet of curiosities\n\n\"Quadrupèdes\" (Quadrupeds)\n\n\"Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux\" (Birds) (1770–1783)\n\n\n\"Histoire Naturelle des Minéraux\" (Minerals) (1783–1788)\n\n\"Suppléments à l’Histoire Naturelle, générale et particulière\" (Supplements) (1774–1789)\n\n\"Histoire Naturelle des Quadrupèdes ovipares et des Serpents\" (Egg-laying Quadrupeds and Snakes) (1788–1789)\n\n\n\"Histoire Naturelle des Poissons\" (Fish) (1798–1803)\n\n\"Histoire Naturelle des Cétacés\" (Cetaceans) (1804)\n\nThe \"Histoire Naturelle\" had a distinctly mixed reception in the eighteenth century. Wealthy homes in both England and France purchased copies, and the first edition was sold out within six weeks. But Buffon was criticised by some priests for suggesting (in the essay \"Les Epoques de Nature\", Volume XXXIV) that the earth was more than 6,000 years old and that mountains had arisen in geological time. Buffon cites as evidence that fossil sea-shells had been found at the tops of mountains; but the claim was seen as contradicting the biblical account in the Book of Genesis. Buffon also disagreed with Linnaeus's system of classifying plants as described in \"Systema Naturae\" (1735). In Buffon's view, expounded in the \"Premier Discours\" of the \"Histoire Naturelle\" (1749), the concept of species was entirely artificial, the only real entity in nature being the individual; as for a taxonomy based on the number of stamens or pistils in a flower, mere counting (despite Buffon's own training in mathematics) had no bearing on nature.\n\nThe Paris faculty of theology, acting as the official censor, wrote to Buffon with a list of statements in the \"Histoire Naturelle\" that were contradictory to Roman Catholic Church teaching. Hypocritically, Buffon replied that he believed firmly in the biblical account of creation, and was able to continue printing his book, and remain in position as the leader of the 'old school', complete with his job as director of the royal botanical garden. On Buffon's death, the 19-year-old Georges Cuvier celebrated with the words \"This time, the Comte de Buffon is dead and buried\". Soon afterwards, the French revolution went much further in sweeping away old attitudes to natural history, along with much else.\n\nThe Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy calls the \"Histoire Naturelle\" \"Buffon's major work\", observing that \"In addressing the history of the earth, Buffon also broke with the 'counter-factual' tradition of Descartes, and presented a secular and realist account of the origins of the earth and its life forms.\" In its view, the work created an \"age of Buffon\", defining what natural history itself was, while Buffon's \"Discourse on Method\" (unlike that of Descartes) at the start of the work argued that repeated observation could lead to a greater certainty of knowledge even than \"mathematical analysis of nature\". Buffon also led natural history away from the natural theology of British parson-naturalists such as John Ray. He thus offered both a new methodology and an empirical style of enquiry. Buffon's position on evolution is complex; he noted in Volume 4 from Daubenton's comparative anatomy of the horse and the donkey that species might \"transform\", but initially (1753) rejected the possibility. However, in doing so he changed the definition of a species from a fixed or universal class (which could not change, by definition) to \"the historical succession of ancestor and descendant linked by material connection through generation\", identified by the ability to mate and produce fertile offspring. Thus the horse and donkey, which produce only sterile hybrids, are seen empirically not to be the same species, even though they have similar anatomy. That empirical fact leaves open the possibility of evolution.\n\nThe botanist Sandra Knapp writes that \"Buffon's prose was so purple that the ideas themselves are almost hidden\", observing that this was also the contemporary academic opinion. She notes that some quite radical ideas are to be found in his work, but they are almost invisible, given the language they are cloaked in. She quotes Buffon's dramatic description of the lion, which along with the engraving in her view \"emphasized both the lion's regal bearing and personality not only in his text but also in the illustration... A reader was left in no doubt as to the importance and character of the animal.\" She concludes \"No wonder the cultured aristocratic public lapped it up – the text reads more like a romantic novel than a dry scientific treatise\".\n\nThe evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr comments that \"In this monumental and fascinating \"Histoire naturelle\", Buffon dealt in a stimulating manner with almost all the problems that would subsequently be raised by evolutionists. Written in a brilliant style, this work was read in French or in one of the numerous translations by every educated person in Europe\". Mayr argued that \"virtually all the well-known writers of the Enlightenment\" were \"Buffonians\", and calls Buffon \"the father of all thought in natural history in the second half of the eighteenth century\".\n\nMayr notes that Buffon was not an \"evolutionist\", but was certainly responsible for creating the great amount of interest in natural history in France. He agrees that Buffon's thought is hard to classify and even self-contradictory, and that the theologians forced him to avoid writing some of his opinions openly. Mayr argues however that Buffon was \"fully aware of the possibility of 'common descent', and was perhaps the first author ever to articulate it clearly\", quoting Buffon at length, starting with \"Not only the ass and the horse, but also man, the apes, the quadrupeds, and all the animals might be regarded as constituting but a single family\", and later \"that man and ape have a common origin\", and that \"the power of nature...with sufficient time, she has been able from a single being to derive all the other organized beings\". Mayr notes, however, that Buffon immediately rejects the suggestion and offers three arguments against it, namely that no new species have arisen in historical times; that hybrid infertility firmly separates species; and that animals intermediate between, say, the horse and the donkey are not seen (in the fossil record).\n"}

Small-scale hydro has significant developmental potential in Azerbaijan. In particular, the lower reaches of the Kura river, the Aras river and other rivers flowing into the Caspian Sea. Hydropower could conceivably provide up to 30% of Azerbaijan’s electricity requirements. Currently, hydropower, dominated by large-scale dams, provides 11.4% of Azerbaijan’s electricity.\n\nWater is the main renewable resource contributing to the energy supply in Azerbaijan and this accounted for 18% of electricity generation in 2010. Azerbaijan has about 1000 MW of operating hydropower capacity and an additional 62 MW of planned hydropower capacity. The largest hydroelectric power plant is Mingachevir; it has an installed capacity of 402 MW and is situated on the Kura River. Furthermore, there are presently three more hydroelectric power plants with an installed capacity of more than 100 MW in Azerbaijan, all of which are situated on the Kura River. The water resources of Azerbaijan are located in the following areas:\n\n\nfor the rivers in Azerbaijan can go up to 40 TWh. Based on the June 2012 mission, the economically feasible potential amounts to less than 1 TWh, all of which is related to small HPPs of the river runoff type. This is equivalent to an installed capacity of about 400 MW, according to Azerenerji. \n\nThe construction of HPPs plays an important role in solving issues of flood control, the clean production of electricity and the creation of new irrigation systems. In the near future, the construction of 61 small HPPs is planned. Small HPPs are often located in settlements that are located far from the power lines and substations of the unified energy system. However, it may meet the local power needs, which may also help to solve other social problems. By the end of 2013, the plan is that 20 government-financed small HPPs will be completed with a total installed capacity of 86 MW. Azerenerji has prepared a programme of new HPPs, amounting to an installed capacity of 1.3 GW, including small HPPs. Two projects have been started to date, namely the Sheki and Mughan HPPs. There are also projects on the Yukhari Shirvan and Bash Mil irrigation canals. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) promoted small hydro development in Azerbaijan in the form of a project that ran from 2007-2010, which had a budget of around $1.5 million, provided by Norway.\n\nThe construction of largest hydroelectric power station in the South Caucasus Mingachevir HPP started in 1945, the first hydro aggregate was put into operation in 1953. In 1955, the station was put into operation with full capacity.\n\nDuring Soviet period Azerbaijan realized several other large-scale projects in the 1970-80s. In order to provide a certain part of electricity demand of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic with internal resources, “Araz” hydroelectric power station with 22 MVt power was built on Araz River in 1971.\n\nSerseng reservoir and a hydroelectric power station with 50MVt power capacity were put into operation on the Terter River in 1976-1977 for the irrigation of productive lands, to improve electricity supply of the region, to reduce wastes in the energy transmission, and develop agriculture in Garabakh. Currently, this object is in the areas which are under temporary Armenian occupation.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the electric station in the republic with the total power capacity of 2882 MVt produced electrical power of 15.4 billion KVt-hour. However, the increasing demand of the rapidly developing economy made Azerbaijan to export 2.9-3.5 billion KVt-hour electrical power from the neighboring countries. In order to fill this gap, it was decided to begin the construction of Shemkir HPS.\n\nIn the 1980s, Shemkir HES with 380 MVt power capacity were put into operation.\n\nThe construction of Yenikend water reservoir and hydroelectric power station (its construction started in 1984) huge amount of electricity has been produced within the boundaries of Azerbaijan.\n\n\nList of power stations in Azerbaijan\n\nRenewable energy sources in Azerbaijan\n\nNatural Resources of Azerbaijan\n\nEnergy in Azerbaijan\n\nhttp://www.azerenerji.gov.az\n"}

{"id": "8983348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8983348", "title": "Leucitite", "text": "Leucitite\n\nLeucitite or leucite rock is an igneous rock containing leucite. It is scarce, many countries such as England being entirely without them. However, they are of wide distribution, occurring in every quarter of the globe. Taken collectively, they exhibit a considerable variety of types and are of great interest petrographically. For the presence of this mineral it is necessary that the silica percentage of the rock should be low, since leucite is incompatible with free quartz and reacts with it to form potassium feldspar. Because it weathers rapidly, leucite is most common in lavas of recent and Tertiary age, which have a fair amount of potassium, or at any rate have potassium equal to or greater than sodium; if sodium is abundant nepheline occurs rather than leucite.\n\nIn pre-Tertiary rocks leucite readily decomposes and changes to zeolites, analcite and other secondary minerals. Leucite also is rare in plutonic rocks and dike rocks, but leucite syenite and leucite tinguaite bear witness to the possibility that it may occur in this manner. The rounded shape of its crystals, their white or grey color, and absence of planar cleavage make the presence of leucite easily determinable in many of these rocks by inspection, especially when the crystals are large.\n\n\"Pseudoleucites\" are rounded areas consisting of feldspar, nepheline, analcite, &c., which have the shape, composition and sometimes even the outward crystalline shape of leucite; they are probably pseudomorphs or paramorphs, which have developed from leucite because this mineral is not stable at ordinary temperatures and can be expected under favorable conditions to undergo spontaneous change into an aggregate of other minerals. Leucite is very often accompanied by nepheline, sodalite or nosean; other minerals which make their appearance with some frequency are melanite, garnet and melilite.\n\nThe plutonic leucite-bearing rocks are leucite syenite and missourite. Of these the former consists of orthoclase, nepheline, sodalite, diopside and aegirine, biotite and sphene. Two occurrences are known, one in Arkansas, the other in Sutherland, Scotland. The Scottish rock has been called borolanite. Both examples show large rounded spots in the hand specimens; they are pseudoleucites, and under the microscope prove to consist of orthoclase, nepheline, sodalite and decomposition products. These have a radiate arrangement externally, but are of irregular structure at their centres; in both rocks melanite is an important accessory. The missourites are more mafic and consist of leucite, olivine, augite and biotite; the leucite is partly fresh partly altered to analcite, and the rock has a spotted character recalling that of the leucite-syenites. It has been found only in the Highwood Mountains of Montana.\n\nThe leucite-hearing dike-rocks are members of the tinguaite and monchiquite groups. The leucite tinguaites are usually pale grey or greenish in color and consist principally of nepheline, alkali feldspar and aegirine. The latter forms bright green moss-like patches and growths of indefinite shape, or in other cases scattered acicular prisms, among the feldspars and nephelines of the ground mass. Where leucite occurs, it is always euhedral in small, equant, many-sided crystals in the ground mass, or in larger masses which have the same characters as the pseudoleucites. Biotite occurs in some of these rocks, and melanite also is present. Nepheline decreases in amount as leucite increases since the abundances of the two reflect the Na:K ratio of the rock. Rocks of this group are known from Rio de Janeiro, Arkansas, Kola Peninsula (in Russia), Montana and a few other places., In Greenland there are leucite tinguaites with much arfvedsonite, (hornblende) and eudialyte. Wherever they occur they accompany leucite- and nepheline syenites. Leucite monchiquites are fine-grained dark rocks consisting of olivine, titaniferous augite and iron oxides, with a glassy ground mass in which small rounded crystals of leucite are scattered. They have been described from Czechoslovakia.\n\nBy far the greater number of the rocks which contain leucite are lavas of Tertiary or recent geological age. Although these never contain quartz, but feldspar is usually present, though there are certain groups of leucite lavas which are non-feldspathic. Many of them also contain nepheline, sodalite, hauyne and nosean; the much rarer mineral melilite appears also in some examples. The commonest ferromagnesian mineral is augite (sometimes rich in sodium), with olivine in the more basic varieties. Hornblende and biotite occur also, but are less common. Melanite is found in some of the lavas, as in the leucite syenites.\n\nThe rocks in which orthoclase (\"or sanidine\") is present in considerable amount are leucite-trachytes, leucite-phonolites and leucitophvres. Of these groups the two former, which are not sharply distinguished from one another by most authors, are common in the neighborhood of Rome. They are of trachytic appearance, containing phenocysts of sanidine, leucite, augite and biotite. Sodalite or hauyne may also be present, but nepheline is typically absent. Rocks of this class occur also in the tuffs of the Phlegraean Fields, near Naples. The leucitophyres are rare rocks which have been described from various parts of the volcanic district of the Rhine (Olbrck. Laacher See, etc.) and from Monte Vulture in Italy. They are rich in leucite, but contain also some sanidine and often much nepheline with hauyne or nosean. Their pyroxene is principally aegirine or aegirine-augite; some of them are rich in melanite. Microscopic sections of some of these rocks are of great interest on account of their beauty and the variety of feldspathoid minerals which they contain. In Brazil leucitophyres have been found which belong to the Carboniferous period.\n\nThose leucite rocks which contain abundant essential plagioclase feldspar are known as leucite tephrites and leucite basanites. The former consist mainly of plagioclase, leucite and augite, while the latter contain olivine in addition. The leucite is often present in two sets of crystals, both porphyritic and as an ingredient of the ground mass. It is always idiomorphic with rounded outlines. The feldspar ranges from bytownite to oligoclase, being usually a variety of labradorite; orthoclase is scarce. The augite varies a good deal in chemnistry and optical character, being green, brown or violet (suggesting high Na and Ti content), but it is rarely high enough in Na and Fe to qualify as aegirine-augite or aegirine. Among the accessory minerals biotite, brown hornblende, hauyne, iron oxides and apatite are the commonest; melanite and nepheline may also occur. The ground mass of these rocks is only occasionally rich in glass. The leucite-tephrites and leucite-basanites of Vesuvius and Somma are familiar examples of this class of rocks. They are black or ashy-grey in color, often vesicular, and may contain many large grey phenocysts of leucite. Their black augite and yellow green olivine are also easily observed in hand specimens. From Volcan Ello, Sardinia and Roccamonfina similar rocks are obtained; they occur also in Bohemia, in Java, Celebes, Kilimanjaro (Africa) and near Trebizond in Asia Minor.\n\nLeucite lavas from which feldspar is absent are divided into the leucitites and leucite basalts. The latter contain olivine, the former do not. Pyroxene is the usual ferromagnesian mineral, and resembles that of the tephrites and basanites. Sanidine, melanite, hauyne and perovskite are frequent accessory minerals in these rocks, and many of them contain melilite in some quantity, The well-known leucitite of the Capo di Bove, near, Rome, is rich in this mineral, which forms irregular plates, yellow in the hand specimen, enclosing many small rounded crystals of leucite. Bracciano and Roccamonfina are other Italian localities for leucitite, and in Java, Montana, Celebes and New South Wales similar rocks occur, The leucite basalts belong to more basic types and are rich in olivine and augite. They occur in great numbers in the Rhenish volcanic district (Eifel, Laacher See) and in Bohemia, and accompany tephrites or leucitites in Java, Montana, Celebes and Sardinia. The \"peperino\" of the neighborhood of Rome is a leucitite tuff.\n\n"}

All basins larger than are included as well as selected smaller basins. It includes drainage basins which do not flow to the ocean (endorheic basins). It includes oceanic sea drainage basins which have hydrologically coherent areas (oceanic seas are set by IHO convention).\n\nThe oceans drain approximately 83% of the land in the world. The other 17% – an area larger than the basin of the Arctic Ocean – drains to internal endorheic basins.\n\nNote that there are substantial areas of the world that do not \"drain\" in the commonly understood sense. In Arctic deserts much of the snowfall sublimates directly into the air and does not melt into flowing water, while in equatorial deserts precipitation may evaporate before joining any substantial water course. However, these areas can still be included in topographically defined basins if one considers the hypothetical flow of water (or ice), and thus nutrients or pollutants, over the surface of the ground (or ice sheet); this is the approach taken here. For example, the Antarctic ice sheet can be divided into basins, and most of Libya is included in the Mediterranean Sea basin even though almost no water from the interior actually reaches the sea.\n\n\n"}

The protected areas network of Madagascar is managed by the Madagascar National Parks Association (PNM-ANGAP). The network includes three types of protected areas: Strict Nature Reserves (IUCN category Ia), National Parks (IUCN category II) and Wildlife Reserves (IUCN category IV). At the 2003 IUCN World Parks Congress in Durban, the Malagasy President, Marc Ravalomanana, announced an initiative to more than triple the area under protection from approximately to over (from 3% to 10% of Madagascar's area). This \"Durban Vision\", as it has been dubbed, involved broadening the definition of protected areas in the country and legislation has been passed to allow the creation of four new categories of protected area: Natural Parks (IUCN category II), Natural Monuments (IUCN category III), Protected Landscapes (IUCN category V), and Natural Resource Reserves (IUCN category VI). As well as allowing these new objectives for protected areas management, the new legislation also provided for entities other than PNM-ANGAP to manage protected areas, such as government ministries, community associations, NGOs and other civil society organizations, and the private sector.\n\nThe protection of natural sites in Madagascar was initiated under the French colonial authority in 1927. These original sites were reserved for scientific research and were not open to the public. In 1971, the Malagasy government undertook a project to protect of mangrove forests, the first national effort to protect Madagascar's marine ecosystems. In 1986 the government of Madagascar, with support from the IUCN and the World Wildlife Fund, initiated a twelve-year process to review and assess existing protected areas and others requiring protection to create an initial list of Madagascar's conservation priority areas. The \"Association Nationale pour la Gestion des Aires Protégées\" (ANGAP), established in 1990, was the first government agency created with the express purpose of expanding and managing Madagascar's protected areas.\n\nThe creation of a national park system began in 1991 with the first major national policies for environmental protection and moved through three phases before concluding in 2002 with the establishment of the \"Systèmes des Aires Protégées de Madagascar\" (SAPM). As co-president of this commission, the World Wildlife Fund supports the government of Madagascar in managing the parks while also developing management partnerships with a broader variety of partners, including local communities, civil society and the private sector. In 2003, an additional 92 areas were identified as meriting the status of protected area; some of these have since been accorded an official protected status, while others are pending review. Ensuring the legal status and protection of the complete list of areas added to meet the Durban Vision commitment requires an updating of the law concerning protected areas, which was stalled following the political crisis of 2009.\n\nOn 17 September 2003 at the IUCN World Parks Congress in Durban, President Marc Ravalomanana announced an expansion of Madagascar's protected areas from to over (from 3% to 10% of Madagascar's area) over the next five years. The Malagasy government formed the \"Commission du Système des Aires Protégées de Madagascar\" (Commission for the Protected Areas System of Madagascar, SAPM) to work in partnership with the concerned government ministries (the \"Ministère de l’Environnement, des Eaux et Forêts\" [Ministry of Environment, Water and Forests] and the \"Ministère de l’Agriculture, de l’Elevage et de la Pêche\" [Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fishery]). In March 2005, following a series of intensive collaborations with the UICN and other international and local experts, the government put in place the current system of classification and legal protection for Madagascar's protected areas.\n\nIn 1999 the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2007 six other national parks were voted in as a joint World Heritage Site under the name Rainforests of the Atsinanana. These six parks are Marojejy, Masoala, Ranomafana, Zahamena, Andohahela and Andringitra National Park. UNESCO placed the Rainforests of the Atsinanana on the list of World Heritage in Danger on 30 July 2010 following an increase in illegal logging in the parks since 2009 as a consequence of political crisis in the country.\n\n"}

{"id": "24906899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24906899", "title": "Measurement of sea ice", "text": "Measurement of sea ice\n\nMeasurement of sea ice is important for safety of navigation and for monitoring the environment, particularly the climate. Sea ice extent interacts with large climate patterns such as the North Atlantic oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, to name just two, and influences climate in the rest of the globe.\n\nThe amount of sea ice coverage in the arctic has been of interest for centuries, as the Northwest Passage was of high interest for trade and seafaring. There is a longstanding history of records and measurements of some effects of the sea ice extent, but comprehensive measurements were sparse till the 1950s and started with the satellite era in the late 1970s. Modern direct records include data about ice extent, ice area, concentration, thickness, and the age of the ice. The current trends in the records show a significant decline in Northern hemisphere sea ice and a small but statistically significant increase in the \"winter\" Southern hemisphere sea ice.\n\nFurthermore, current research comprises and establishes extensive sets of multi-century historical records of arctic and subarctic sea ice and uses, among others high-resolution paleo-proxy sea-ice records. The arctic sea ice is a dynamic climate-system component and is linked to the Atlantic multidecadal variability and the historical climate over various decades. There are circular changes of sea ice patterns but so far no clear patterns based on modeling predictions.\n\nRecords assembled by Vikings showing the number of weeks per year that ice occurred along the north coast of Iceland date back to A.D. 870, but a more complete record exists since 1600. More extensive written records of Arctic sea ice date back to the mid-18th century. The earliest of those records relate to Northern Hemisphere shipping lanes, but records from that period are sparse. Air temperature records dating back to the 1880s can serve as a stand-in (proxy) for Arctic sea ice, but such temperature records were initially collected at only 11 locations. Russia’s Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute has compiled ice charts dating back to 1933. Today, scientists studying Arctic sea ice trends can rely on a fairly comprehensive record dating back to 1953, using a combination of satellite records, shipping records, and ice charts from several countries.\n\nIn the Antarctic, direct data prior to the satellite record are even more sparse. To try to extend the historical record of Southern Hemisphere sea ice extent further back in time, scientists have been investigating various proxies for sea ice extent. One is records kept by Antarctic whalers that document the location of all whales caught and relate to sea ice observations directly. There seems to be an abrupt mid-twentieth-century decline in Antarctic sea-ice extent from whaling records, the direct global estimates of the Antarctic sea-ice cover from satellite observations, since the 1970 provide no clear trends. Because whales tend to congregate near the sea ice edge to feed, their locations could be a proxy for the ice extent. Other proxies use the presence of phytoplankton-derived organic compounds and other extremophiles traces in Antarctic ice cores and sediments. Since phytoplankton grow most abundantly along the edges of the ice pack, the concentration of this sulfur-containing organic compounds and their geochemistry provide indicators of how far the ice edge extended from the continent. There are further extensive sets of multicentury historical records of arctic and subarctic sea ice and uses, among others high-resolution paleo proxy sea-ice records.\n\nUseful satellite data concerning sea ice began in December 1972 with the Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR) instrument. However, this was not directly comparable with the later SMMR/SSMI, and so the practical record begins in late 1978 with the launch of NASA’s Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) satellite., and continues with the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSMI). Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) and Cryosat-2.\n\nSince 1979, satellites have provided a consistent continuous record of sea ice.\nSatellite images of sea ice are made from observations of microwave energy radiated from the Earth’s surface. Because ocean water emits microwaves differently from sea ice, ice \"looks\" different from water to the satellite sensor—see sea ice emissivity modelling. The observations are processed into digital picture elements, or pixels. Each pixel represents a square surface area on Earth. The first instruments provided approximately 25 kilometers by 25 kilometers resolution; later instruments higher. Algorithms examine the microwave emissions, and their vertical and horizontal polarisations, and estimate the ice area.\n\nSea ice may be considered in terms of total volume, or in terms of areal coverage. Volume is harder, because it requires a knowledge of the ice thickness, which is hard to measure directly; efforts such as PIOMAS use a combination of observations and modelling to estimate total volume.\n\nThere are two ways to express the total polar ice cover: ice area and ice extent. To estimate ice area, scientists calculate the percentage of sea ice in each pixel, multiply by the pixel area, and total the amounts. To estimate ice extent, scientists set a threshold percentage, and count every pixel meeting or exceeding that threshold as \"ice-covered.\" The common threshold is 15 percent.\n\nThe threshold–based approach may seem less accurate, but it has the advantage of being more consistent. When scientists are analyzing satellite data, it is easier to say whether there is or isn’t at least 15 percent ice cover in a pixel than it is to say, for example, whether the ice cover is 70 percent or 75 percent. By reducing the uncertainty in the amount of ice, scientists can be more certain that changes in sea ice cover over time are real.\n\nA careful analysis of satellite radar altimetry echoes can distinguish between those backscattered from the open ocean, new ice or multi-year ice. The difference between the elevation of the echoes from snow/sea ice and open water gives the elevation of the ice above the ocean; the ice thickness can be computed from this. The technique has a limited vertical resolution - perhaps 0.5m - and is easily confused by the presence of even small amounts of open water. Hence it has mostly been used in the Arctic, where the ice is thicker and more continuous.\n\nStarting in 1958 U. S. Navy submarines collected upward-looking sonar profiles, for navigation and defense, and converted the information into estimates of ice thickness. Data from U. S. and Royal Navy submarines available from the NSIDC includes maps showing submarine tracks. Data are provided as ice draft profiles and as statistics derived from the profile data. Statistics files include information concerning ice draft characteristics, keels, level ice, leads, undeformed and deformed ice.\n\nBuoys are placed on the ice to measure ice properties and weather conditions by the participants of the International Arctic Buoy Program and its sister, the International Programme for Antarctic Buoys. Buoys can have sensors to measure air temperature, atmospheric pressure, buoy position ice growth/melt, ice temperature, ocean currents, sea ice motion, sea level pressure, sea surface temperature, skin temperature, surface air temperature, surface winds, and water temperature.\n\nUpward looking sonar (ULS) devices can be deployed under polar ice over a period of months or even years, and can provide a complete profile of ice thickness for a single site.\n\nAuxiliary observations of sea ice are made from shore stations, ships, and from aircraft.\n\nAlthough in recent years remotely sensed data has come to play a major role in sea ice analysis, it is not yet possible to compile a complete and accurate picture of sea ice conditions from this data source alone. Auxiliary sea ice observations play a major role in confirming remotely sensed ice information or providing important corrections to the overall picture of ice conditions.\n\nThe most important auxiliary sea ice observation is the location of the ice edge. Its value reflects both the importance of the ice edge location in general and the difficulty of accurately locating the ice edge with remotely sensed data. It is also useful to provide a description of the ice edge in terms of indications of freezing or thawing, wind-driven advance or retreat, and compactness or diffuseness. Other important auxiliary information includes the location of the icebergs, floebergs, ice islands, old ice, ridging and hummocking. These ice features are poorly monitored by remote sensing techniques but are very important aspects of the ice cover.\n\nSea ice extent is the area of sea with a specified amount of ice, usually 15%. To satellite microwave sensors, surface melt appears to be open water rather than water on top of sea ice. So, while reliable for measuring area most of the year, the microwave sensors are prone to underestimating the actual ice concentration and area when the surface is melting.\n\nTo estimate ice area, scientists calculate the percentage of sea ice in each pixel, multiply by the pixel area, and total the amounts. To estimate ice extent, scientists set a threshold percentage, and count every pixel meeting or exceeding that threshold as \"ice-covered.\" The National Snow and Ice Data Center, one of NASA’s Distributed Active Archive Centers, monitors sea ice extent using a threshold of 15 percent.\n\nSea ice concentration is the percentage of an area that is covered with sea ice.\n\nSea ice thickness increases over time, and increases when winds and currents push the ice together. The European Space Agency's Cryosat-2 satellite was launched in April 2010 on a quest to map the thickness and shape of the Earth's polar ice cover. Its single instrument - a SAR/Interferometric Radar Altimeter is able to measure the sea ice freeboard.\n\nThe age of the ice is another key descriptor of the state of the sea ice cover, since older ice tends to be thicker and more resilient than younger ice. Sea ice rejects salt over time and becomes less salty resulting in a higher melting point. A simple two-stage approach classifies sea ice into first year and multiyear ice. First-year is ice that has not yet survived a summer melt season, while multi-year ice has survived at least one summer and can be several years old.\nSee sea ice growth processes.\n\nSea ice mass balance is the balance of how much the ice grows in the winter and melts in the summer. For Arctic sea ice virtually all of the growth occurs on the bottom of the ice. Melting occurs on both the top and the bottom of the ice. In the vast majority of cases all of the snow melts during the summer, typically in just a couple of weeks. The mass balance is a powerful concept since it is the great integrator of the heat budget. If there is a net increase of heat, then the ice will thin. A net cooling will result in thicker ice.\n\nMaking direct measurements of the mass balance is simple. An array of stakes and thickness gauges is used to measure ablation and accumulation of ice and snow at the top and bottom of the ice cover. In spite of the importance of mass balance measurements and the relatively simple equipment involved in making them, there are few observational results. This is due, in large part, to the expense involved in operating a long-term field camp to serve as the base for these studies.\n\nThere are no Arctic-wide or Antarctic-wide measurements of the volume of sea ice, but the volume of the Arctic sea ice is calculated using the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) developed at the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory/Polar Science Center. PIOMAS blends satellite-observed sea ice concentrations into model calculations to estimate sea ice thickness and volume. Comparison with submarine, mooring, and satellite observations help increase the confidence of the model results.\n\nICESat was a laser altimeter equipped satellite, which could measure the freeboard of ice flows. Its active service period was from February 2003 to October 2009. Together with a set of auxiliary data like ice density, snow cover thickness, air pressure, water salinity one can calculate the flow thickness and thus its volume. Its data have been compared with the respective PIOMAS data and a reasonably agreement has been found.\n\nCryosat-2, launched in April 2010, has the ability to measure the freeboard of ice flows, just like ICESat, only that it uses radar instead of laser pulses. Data is calculated with the PIOMAS model.\n\nReliable and consistent records for all seasons are only available during the satellite era, from 1979 onwards.\n\nAccording to scientific measurements, both the thickness and extent of summer sea ice in the Arctic have shown a dramatic decline over the past thirty years.\n\nRecords before the satellite era are sparse. William K. de la Mare, 1997, in \"Abrupt mid-twentieth-century decline in Antarctic sea-ice extent from whaling records\" found a southwards shift in ice edge based on whaling records; these findings have been questioned, but later papers by de la Mare and by Cotte support the same conclusion.\n\nThe satellite-derived Antarctic sea ice trends show pronounced increase in the central Pacific sector by ∼4–10% per decade and a decrease in the Bellingshausen/western Weddell sector with similar percentages but lower extent. There is a close connection to the Antarctic Oscillation of the further and impacts of positive polarities of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) for the latter. The magnitude of the ice changes associated with the AAO and ENSO are smaller than the regional ice trends and local (or less understood large) scale processes still need to be investigated for a complete explanations.\n\nScientists use the 1981 to 2010 average because it provides a consistent baseline for year-to-year comparisons of sea ice extent. Thirty years is considered a standard baseline period for weather and climate, and the satellite record is now long enough to provide a thirty-year baseline period.\n\n\n"}

They cover the lower Atlantic coastal plain and are bordered on the west by the Southeastern mixed forests.\n\nThe habitats of the ecoregion are constantly modified by natural processes. The bottomlands, coastal plains, and maritime areas are vulnerable to tropical cyclones and floods. The drier areas with porous sandy soils are susceptible to fires and drought. Fire return intervals of 1 to 3 years favor herbaceous plants; longer intervals favor dense shrubs, to broadleaved evergreen trees.\n\nThis ecoregion has a humid subtropical climate with hot summers and mild winters, and with the heaviest precipitation concentrated in the warmest months.\n\nTwo basic types of forests are found in this region; 1) Southern mixed pine-oak forests that see frequent fire with sandy soils, and 2) isolated patches of evergreen broadleaved forests and \"hammocks\" close to the Atlantic coastline in the southernmost areas in coastal South Carolina and coastal Georgia.\n\nThe mixed pine-oak forests occur on dry or sandy soils or in areas exposed to occasional fires. Longleaf pine (\"Pinus palustris\"), superbly adapted to fire-prone environments, was the principal tree in many of these forests; however, extensive logging and human development have reduced this trees occurrence to less than 5% of its former range. Loblolly pine (\"Pinus taeda\") and shortleaf pine (\"Pinus echinata\") grow in sandy soils and are still dominant in this ecosystem. Loblolly is widely planted on millions of acres of plantation forest's across the southeastern US. On moist soils or where fires are infrequent, hardwoods overtake the pines. These hardwoods include turkey oak (\"Quercus laevis\"), post oak (\"Quercus stellata\"), myrtle oak (\"Quercus myrtifolia\"), Spanish oak (\"Quercus falcata\"), and southern catalpa (\"Catalpa bignonioides\").\n\nEvergreen broadleaved forests occur close to the coast in localized areas as either evergreen Maritime oak forests or as more localized evergreen hammocks(geographically induced forest islands) (Box 1985). These forests consist of evergreen broadleaved canopy trees, such as Magnolia grandiflora, Magnolia virginiana, Persea borbonia, Gordonia lasianthus, Sabal, and several evergreen oaks such as Quercus myrtifolia, and the iconic Quercus virginiana or southern Live Oak often covered with Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides). The understory is also often evergreen in these forests, with Myrica cerifera and Osmanthus americanus very common, while several evergreen species of Ericaceae, Ilex, and scrub palms (Sabal minor and Serenoa) are common on more moist sites. In the open areas near sandy beaches and coastal areas, large endemic populations of Yucca and cactus (Opuntia) thrive in the hot sun and sandy soils.\n\nThe Middle Atlantic coastal forests contain the most diverse assemblage of freshwater wetland communities in North America. These include freshwater marshes, shrub bogs, white cedar swamps, bayheads, and wet hammocks.\n\nThe bottomland hardwood forests for which the ecoregion is famous are dominated by bald cypress (\"Taxodium distichum\") and swamp tupelo (\"Nyssa sylvatica\" var. \"biflora\").\n\nBald cypress swamps are often dominated by their namesake tree, and are too wet for foot travel. Many uncommon orchids grow among the baldcypress branches.\n\nSwamp tupelo, along with water tupelo (\"Nyssa aquatica\"), dominate mixed-hardwood swamp forests. These grow aside water-adapted oaks that include water oak (\"Quercus nigra\"), swamp chestnut oak (\"Quercus michauxii\"), cherrybark oak (\"Quercus pagoda\"), willow oak (\"Quercus phellos\"), and overcup oak (\"Quercus lyrata\"). Swamp hickory (\"Carya glabra\") and water hickory (\"Carya aquatica\") are also found here. Pawpaw (\"Asimina triloba\") grows in the understory.\n\nAtlantic white cedar (\"Chamaecyparis thyoides\") swamps occur along blackwater rivers.\n\nPocosins are flat and damp, sandy, or peaty areas far from streams. They have scattered pond pine (\"Pinus serotina\") and a dense growth of mostly evergreen shrubs including gallberry (\"Ilex glabra\").\n\nBarrier islands along the coast protect extensive estuaries, lagoons, and sounds.\n\nCarolina bays are a unique habitat of the ecoregion.\n\nThe nine-banded armadillo (\"Dasypus novemcinctus\") is a distinctive animal that lives in this ecoregion. The Virginia opossum (\"Didelphis virginiana\") is abundant.\n\nIn the mixed pine-oak forests, the brown-headed nuthatch (\"Sitta pusilla\") feeds on pine seeds. The yellow-throated warbler (\"Dendroica dominica\") is widely distributed. The northern parula warbler (\"Parula americana\") and the eastern bluebird (\"Sialia sialis\") are also found here. The Bachman sparrow (\"Aimophila aestivalis\") and red-cockaded woodpecker (\"Picoides borealis\"), both uncommon, also live in this ecoregion.\n\nThe bottomland forests support abundant arthropods, produce mast that sustains migratory birds during the winter, and produce boles, branch cavities, and rotting logs that support various detritivores and hole-nesting species. In the extreme southeast regions (coastal southeast North Carolina south to Georgia) the large American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) can be found along tidal inlets and marsh areas.\n\nThe main causes of habitat conversion are agriculture, fire suppression, urbanization, coastal development, ditching and draining of wetlands, and damming of rivers.\n\nThe western part of the ecoregion has been most altered. There, the upland vegetation has been nearly completely converted.\n\nLong-leaf pine (\"Pinus palustris\") savannas have nearly disappeared.\n\nThe least altered habitats in the ecoregion are the coastal marshes and deep peatlands.\n\n"}
{"id": "8608695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8608695", "title": "Mobil Economy Run", "text": "Mobil Economy Run\n\nMobil Economy Run was an annual event that took place from 1936 to 1968, except during World War II. It was designed to provide real fuel efficiency numbers during a coast-to-coast test on public roads and with regular traffic and weather conditions. The Mobil Oil Corporation sponsored it and the United States Auto Club (USAC) sanctioned and operated the run.\n\nThe Mobil Economy Run determined the fuel economy or gas mileage potentials of passenger cars under typical driving conditions encountered by average motorists. This was rather different from the current method of computing fuel consumption by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by running cars on chassis dynamometer in a climate-controlled environment. To prevent special preparation or modifications to the participating automobiles for the run, the United States Auto Club purchased the cars at dealerships, checked them and, if certified as \"stock\", their hoods and chassis were sealed. The factory gas tank was disconnected so fuel use could be accurately measured by using a special tank mounted in the trunk. Because of the many types of automobiles, the Mobil Economy Run had eight classes based on wheelbase, engine and body size, as well as price. The leading automakers provided drivers and in each car was a USAC observer to prevent any deviations and penalize for traffic or speed limit violations. Women were permitted to participate in the Mobil-gas contest only from 1957.\n\nThe event was a marketing contest between the automakers. The objective was the coveted title as the Mobilgas Economy Run winner in each class. However, starting in 1959, entries were judged on an actual miles-per-gallon basis, instead of the ton-mileage formula used previously which favored bigger, heavier cars. As a result, compact cars became the top mileage champs. In the 47-car field for 1959, a Rambler American was first - averaging - while a Rambler Six was second - with an average of - for the five-day, trip from Los Angeles, California to Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nThe efficiency of models as AMC's more compact Ramblers caused them to be all but banned from the event. As a result, Ramblers and Studebakers were put in a separate class. This was because the 'Big Three' auto makers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) did not have competitive cars at the time and were trounced in the fuel efficiency rankings until they introduced smaller platforms (GM \"X\" body, Ford Falcon, Chrysler A platform).\n\nAutomakers tried to \"prepare\" their cars to achieve better results. Moreover, the factory-supplied drivers were highly trained and experienced to drive in a manner that conserved fuel. An average driver in the same car and over the same course would be lucky to achieve the Run's results.\n\nThe event received criticism in the form of literary fiction, from the book \"Balloons are Available\" by Jordan Crittenden. In the novel, a fictional character is hit by an automobile during the event. An excerpt from the novel reads \"'It was terrible,' she says. 'The driver couldn't stop because he was competing in a Mobilgas Economy Run.'\"\nOver the years, the Mobil Oil Corporation sponsored many Mobil Economy Run events across the country for various car classes and automobile associations for short distances. In 1963, a \"day-day\" test between Los Angeles and the Grand Canyon eventually evolved into a \"six-day\" endurance test between Los Angeles and New York by the U.S. Auto Club. The last run started in Anaheim CA on Tuesday April 2, 1968 but got cancelled in Indianapolis on Friday April 5th due to civil unrest across the country because of the death of Martin Luther King Jr. on Thursday April 4th. In December of 1968, it was announced by Richard F Tucker, vice president of marketing for Mobil in North America, the event will be cancelled in the United States citing \"changing advertising patterns and changing emphasis in automotive performance as major factors influencing the decision.\"\n\nMobil entered the United Kingdom service station market in 1952, as Mobilgas.

This all-nuclear-powered unit steamed 30,565 miles unrefuelled around the world for sixty-five days.\n\nOperation Sea Orbit was the idea of Vice Admiral John S. McCain, Jr., who saw the exercise – which demonstrated how nuclear-powered ships could operate unfettered by shore logistical ties – as a statement of American technical achievement similar to that of the coal-burning Great White Fleet in 1907-1909.\n\n\"Long Beach\" and \"Bainbridge\" departed Norfolk on 28 April 1964, in company with the aircraft carrier for the Atlantic crossing to the Mediterranean, where the rendezvous with \"Enterprise\" was scheduled. Task Force 1 formed up at Bahia de Pollença, Mallorca on 13 May, before undertaking a series of exercises to test the efficiency of the all-nuclear formation working together.\n\nHaving been relieved by other vessels, TF1 departed on its trans-global cruise on 31 July 1964, with all three ships having taken aboard maximum provisions the day before to ensure there was no need for further underway replenishment en route. The task force initially sailed down the west coast of Africa, calling at Rabat, Dakar; Freetown, Monrovia and Abidjan, before crossing the equator. By 10 August, TF1 had reached the Cape of Good Hope, where it conducted exercises with a pair of South African Navy ships.\n\nFollowing the South African visit, TF1 transited the Mozambique Channel into the Indian Ocean where the ships then called at Mombasa, before transiting the Indian Ocean to Pakistan, where they rendezvoused with three ships of the Pakistan Navy, before the entire force called at Karachi. However, due to the sea conditions it was determined to be too dangerous for either \"Enterprise\" or \"Long Beach\" to enter the port; instead, while \"Bainbridge\" came alongside, the two larger ships were forced to anchor several miles outside the harbour.\n\nUpon departing from Karachi, TF1 transited along the west coast of India before turning towards Australia. While en route, in the area south of Indonesia, the force conducted an exercise with a Royal Navy carrier group led by , before splitting to allow individual port calls at Fremantle (\"Bainbridge\"), Melbourne (\"Long Beach\") and Sydney (\"Enterprise\"), before the three ships reformed for the transit to New Zealand, where both \"Bainbridge\" and \"Long Beach\" additionally called at Wellington.\n\nTF1 crossed the South Pacific Ocean and rounded Cape Horn back into the Atlantic, with visits to Buenos Aires and Montevideo before the entire task force put in at Rio de Janeiro. Having departed Brazil, \"Bainbridge\" was detached on 30 September to return to Charleston, while \"Enterprise\" and \"Long Beach\" put in at Norfolk, all three arriving back on 3 October 1964.\n\nTask Force One had spent 65 days deployed, with 57 of them at sea, and steamed 30,216 miles in total without replenishment. Rear Admiral Strean noted that the flexibility of operating a force of nuclear powered vessels meant that TF1 \"could have been diverted to any other maritime area of the world without logistical considerations and could have been ready for immediate operations upon arrival\".\n\n\nVeterans of Operation Sea Orbit gathered on July 30, 2004, for a 40th anniversary reunion.

Public produce also differs from community gardens in that the food is grown in true public space, such as in parks, plazas, or town squares; along streets; or on the grounds of public institutions, such as city halls, courthouses, libraries, and schools. (Community gardens are often established on vacant residential lots or abandoned private property. These parcels may be owned by the municipality, but they are not generally regarded as true public space, some even having fences and gates to keep the general public from entering).\n\nPublic produce is a recent re-emergence of government-endorsed public food gardens, like the Victory Gardens of World War II. Public food gardens were quite popular in America during periods of war and economic distress. During the Long Depression of the 1890s, World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II, public food gardens bolstered food security, while encouraging self-reliance. Public produce during the 21st century continues to meet the aims of those earlier public space gardens: bolster the fresh produce supply for communities and promote social equity.\n\nAccording to Darrin Nordahl, public produce (a term he coined in his book \"Public Produce: The New Urban Agriculture\") comprises three facets:<br> \n1.

{"id": "36946911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36946911", "title": "Rochester Bestiary", "text": "Rochester Bestiary\n\nThe Rochester Bestiary (London, British Library, Royal MS 12 F.xiii) is a richly illuminated manuscript copy of a medieval bestiary, a book describing the appearance and habits of a large number of familiar and exotic animals, both real and legendary. The animals' characteristics are frequently allegorised, with the addition of a Christian moral.\n\nThe medieval bestiary ultimately derives from the Greek-language \"Physiologus\", a text whose precise date and place of origin is disputed, but which was most likely written in North Africa sometime in the second or third century. The \"Physiologus\" was translated into Latin several times, at least as far back as the eighth century, the date of the first extant manuscripts, and likely much earlier, perhaps the fourth century. While the earliest Latin translations were extremely faithful to their Greek source, later versions adapted more freely, particularly by the inclusion of additional information from other sources, including Pliny's \"Historia naturalis\", and, most significantly, Isidore of Seville's \"Etymologies\". The most important of the Latin \"Physiologus\" translations — the one now known by scholars as the \"B Version\" — was expanded even further in the twelfth century (most likely in the 1160s or 1170s), with more additions from Isidore, to become the so-called \"Second Family\" standard form of what now may be properly termed as the bestiary. This text was much longer than the original \"Physiologus\" and included in its typical format over 100 sections, distributed among nine major divisions of varying size. The first division included 44 animals or beasts and the second 35 birds, followed by a large division on different varieties of snakes, and divisions on worms, fish, trees, precious stones, and the nature and ages of man. Manuscripts from this most familiar version of the bestiary were produced from the twelfth to sixteenth centuries, with most dating from the thirteenth century.\n\nThe Rochester Bestiary is a parchment manuscript dating from c. 1230–1240. Its principle contents are a bestiary, but it also contains a short lapidary (a treatise on stones) in French prose and, as the flyleaves, two leaves of a 14th-century service book. It is illustrated with 55 finished miniatures of various animals, each at the end of the passage describing that animal. On some pages, instructions to the illuminator are visible, briefly describing what the planned picture should depict. About a third of the way through the manuscript (f. 52v and following, after the vulture), the illustrations cease: while spaces remain where they were intended to be placed, no illustrations were ever added. The style of the miniatures shows some evidence that the illustrations were made as much as a decade or more after the initial production of the text, and it is possible that the artist did not fully understand the projected plan envisioned by the scribe: by adding a fourth picture of a lion, instead of the planned three, he forced subsequent illustrations to be placed after the animals they described, instead of before. Three other extant manuscripts feature illuminations by this artist: Cambridge, University Library, MS. Ee.2.23 (a Bible), Peterborough, Cathedral Library, MS. 10 (a Bible), and Stockholm, National Museum, MS. B. 2010 (a psalter). A fourth manuscript (Turin, Biblioteca Nazionale, Cod. L.IV.25) contained two full-page miniatures from this artist, but was destroyed in 1904.\n\nThe manuscript is usually assumed to have been made at St. Andrew's Priory at Rochester Cathedral. An inscription places the book there with certainty in the fourteenth century. At some point, it appears that the book was stolen from the priory, as another fourteenth-century inscription notes its return by a \"brother John Malling,\" who may have been the culprit: a man named John Malling was excommunicated in 1387 as an apostate and thief. By 1542 it was in the possession of the king, as it is listed in an inventory of the royal library at Westminster in that year. King George II donated it, together with the rest of the Old Royal Library, to the British Museum in 1757, and it is now at the British Library.\n\nAdditions to the standard bestiary text have been made in the Rochester Bestiary by drawing from Part IV of the \"Pantheologus\" by Peter of Aldgate. A complete copy of the \"Pantheologus\", now extant as British Library, Royal MS. 7 E.viii, was located in Rochester in the early 13th century, and may have been the direct source for the bestiary additions.\n\nThe bestiary features the following animals: \n\nA French-language lapidary follows directly on the Latin description of fire stones, giving further descriptions of a large number of stones, including the magnet, coral, carnelian, ceraunius (the \"thunder-stone\"), crystal, and many others.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6757017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6757017", "title": "Space-based solar power", "text": "Space-based solar power\n\nSpace-based solar power (SBSP) is the concept of collecting solar power in outer space and distributing it to Earth. Potential advantages of collecting solar energy in space include a higher collection rate and a longer collection period due to the lack of a diffusing atmosphere, and the possibility of placing a solar collector in an orbiting location where there is no night. A considerable fraction of incoming solar energy (55–60%) is lost on its way through the Earth's atmosphere by the effects of reflection and absorption. Space-based solar power systems convert sunlight to microwaves outside the atmosphere, avoiding these losses and the downtime due to the Earth's rotation, but at great cost due to the expense of launching material into orbit. SBSP is considered a form of sustainable or green energy, renewable energy, and is occasionally considered among climate engineering proposals. It is attractive to those seeking large-scale solutions to anthropogenic climate change or fossil fuel depletion (such as peak oil).\n\nVarious SBSP proposals have been researched since the early 1970s, but none are economically viable with present-day space launch infrastructure. A modest Gigawatt-range microwave system, comparable to a large commercial power plant, would require launching some 80,000 tons of material to orbit, making the cost of energy from such a system vastly more expensive than even present-day renewable energy. Some technologists speculate that this may change in the distant future if an off-world industrial base were to be developed that could manufacture solar power satellites out of asteroids or lunar material, or if radical new space launch technologies other than rocketry should become available in the future.\n\nBesides the cost of implementing such a system, SBSP also introduces several technological hurdles, including the problem of transmitting energy from orbit to Earth's surface for use. Since wires extending from Earth's surface to an orbiting satellite are neither practical nor feasible with current technology, SBSP designs generally include the use of some manner of wireless power transmission with its concomitant conversion inefficiencies, as well as land use concerns for the necessary antenna stations to receive the energy at Earth's surface. The collecting satellite would convert solar energy into electrical energy on board, powering a microwave transmitter or laser emitter, and transmit this energy to a collector (or microwave rectenna) on Earth's surface. Contrary to appearances of SBSP in popular novels and video games, most designs propose beam energy densities that are not harmful if human beings were to be inadvertently exposed, such as if a transmitting satellite's beam were to wander off-course. But the vast size of the receiving antennas that would be necessary would still require large blocks of land near the end users to be procured and dedicated to this purpose. The service life of space-based collectors in the face of challenges from long-term exposure to the space environment, including degradation from radiation and micrometeoroid damage, could also become a concern for SBSP.\n\nSBSP is being actively pursued by Japan, China, and Russia. In 2008 Japan passed its Basic Space Law which established Space Solar Power as a national goal and JAXA has a roadmap to commercial SBSP. In 2015 the China Academy for Space Technology (CAST) briefed their roadmap at the International Space Development Conference (ISDC) where they showcased their road map to a 1 GW commercial system in 2050 and unveiled a video and description of their design.\n\nIn 1941, science fiction writer Isaac Asimov published the science fiction short story \"Reason\", in which a space station transmits energy collected from the Sun to various planets using microwave beams. The SBSP concept, originally known as satellite solar-power system (SSPS), was first described in November 1968. In 1973 Peter Glaser was granted U.S. patent number 3,781,647 for his method of transmitting power over long distances (e.g. from an SPS to Earth's surface) using microwaves from a very large antenna (up to one square kilometer) on the satellite to a much larger one, now known as a rectenna, on the ground.\n\nGlaser then was a vice president at Arthur D. Little, Inc. NASA signed a contract with ADL to lead four other companies in a broader study in 1974. They found that, while the concept had several major problems – chiefly the expense of putting the required materials in orbit and the lack of experience on projects of this scale in space – it showed enough promise to merit further investigation and research.\n\nBetween 1978 and 1986, the Congress authorized the Department of Energy (DoE) and NASA to jointly investigate the concept. They organized the Satellite Power System Concept Development and Evaluation Program. The study remains the most extensive performed to date (budget $50 million). Several reports were published investigating the engineering feasibility of such an engineering project. They include:\n\n\nThe project was not continued with the change in administrations after the 1980 US Federal elections. The Office of Technology Assessment concluded that \"Too little is currently known about the technical, economic, and environmental aspects of SPS to make a sound decision whether to proceed with its development and deployment. In addition, without further research an SPS demonstration or systems-engineering verification program would be a high-risk venture.\"\n\nIn 1997 NASA conducted its \"Fresh Look\" study to examine the modern state of SBSP feasibility. In assessing \"What has changed\" since the DOE study, NASA asserted that the \"US National Space Policy now calls for NASA to make significant investments in technology (not a particular vehicle) to drive the costs of ETO \"[Earth to Orbit]\" transportation down dramatically. This is, of course, an absolute requirement of space solar power.\"\n\nConversely, Dr. Pete Worden of NASA claimed that space-based solar is about five orders of magnitude more expensive than solar power from the Arizona desert, with a major cost being the transportation of materials to orbit. Dr. Worden referred to possible solutions as speculative, and which would not be available for decades at the earliest.\n\nOn Nov 2, 2012, China proposed space collaboration with India that mentioned SBSP, \" . . . may be Space-based Solar Power initiative so that both India and China can work for long term association with proper funding along with other willing space faring nations to bring space solar power to earth.\"\n\nIn 1999, NASA's Space Solar Power Exploratory Research and Technology program (SERT) was initiated for the following purposes:\n\nSERT went about developing a solar power satellite (SPS) concept for a future gigawatt space power system, to provide electrical power by converting the Sun's energy and beaming it to Earth's surface, and provided a conceptual development path that would utilize current technologies. SERT proposed an inflatable photovoltaic gossamer structure with concentrator lenses or solar heat engines to convert sunlight into electricity. The program looked both at systems in sun-synchronous orbit and geosynchronous orbit. Some of SERT's conclusions:\n\nThe May 2014 IEEE Spectrum magazine carried a lengthy article \"It's Always Sunny in Space\" by Dr. Susumu Sasaki. The article stated, \"It's been the subject of many previous studies and the stuff of sci-fi for decades, but space-based solar power could at last become a reality—and within 25 years, according to a proposal from researchers at the Tokyo-based Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).\"\n\nJAXA announced on 12 March 2015 that they wirelessly beamed 1.8 kilowatts 50 meters to a small receiver by converting electricity to microwaves and then back to electricity. This is the standard plan for this type of power. On 12 March 2015 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries demonstrated transmission of 10 kilowatts (kW) of power to a receiver unit located at a distance of 500 meters (m) away.\n\nThe SBSP concept is attractive because space has several major advantages over the Earth's surface for the collection of solar power:\n\nThe SBSP concept also has a number of problems:\n\nSpace-based solar power essentially consists of three elements:\n\nThe space-based portion will not need to support itself against gravity (other than relatively weak tidal stresses). It needs no protection from terrestrial wind or weather, but will have to cope with space hazards such as micrometeors and solar flares. Two basic methods of conversion have been studied: photovoltaic (PV) and solar dynamic (SD). Most analyses of SBSP have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity. Solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate light on a boiler. The use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt. Wireless power transmission was proposed early on as a means to transfer energy from collection to the Earth's surface, using either microwave or laser radiation at a variety of frequencies.\n\nWilliam C. Brown demonstrated in 1964, during Walter Cronkite's CBS News program, a microwave-powered model helicopter that received all the power it needed for flight from a microwave beam. Between 1969 and 1975, Bill Brown was technical director of a JPL Raytheon program that beamed 30 kW of power over a distance of at 84% efficiency.\n\nMicrowave power transmission of tens of kilowatts has been well proven by existing tests at Goldstone in California (1975) and Grand Bassin on Reunion Island (1997).\n\nMore recently, microwave power transmission has been demonstrated, in conjunction with solar energy capture, between a mountain top in Maui and the island of Hawaii (92 miles away), by a team under John C. Mankins.\nTechnological challenges in terms of array layout, single radiation element design, and overall efficiency, as well as the associated theoretical limits are presently a subject of research, as it is demonstrated by the Special Session on \"Analysis of Electromagnetic Wireless Systems for Solar Power Transmission\" to be held in the 2010 IEEE Symposium on Antennas and Propagation. In 2013, a useful overview was published, covering technologies and issues associated with microwave power transmission from space to ground. It includes an introduction to SPS, current research and future prospects.\nMoreover, a review of current methodologies and technologies for the design of antenna arrays for microwave power transmission appeared in the Proceedings of the IEEE \n\nLaser power beaming was envisioned by some at NASA as a stepping stone to further industrialization of space. In the 1980s, researchers at NASA worked on the potential use of lasers for space-to-space power beaming, focusing primarily on the development of a solar-powered laser. In 1989 it was suggested that power could also be usefully beamed by laser from Earth to space. In 1991 the SELENE project (SpacE Laser ENErgy) had begun, which included the study of laser power beaming for supplying power to a lunar base. The SELENE program was a two-year research effort, but the cost of taking the concept to operational status was too high, and the official project ended in 1993 before reaching a space-based demonstration.\n\nIn 1988 the use of an Earth-based laser to power an electric thruster for space propulsion was proposed by Grant Logan, with technical details worked out in 1989. He proposed using diamond solar cells operating at 600 degrees to convert ultraviolet laser light.\n\nThe main advantage of locating a space power station in geostationary orbit is that the antenna geometry stays constant, and so keeping the antennas lined up is simpler. Another advantage is that nearly continuous power transmission is immediately available as soon as the first space power station is placed in orbit; other space-based power stations have much longer start-up times before they are producing nearly continuous power. A collection of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) space power stations has been proposed as a precursor to GEO (Geostationary Orbit) space-based solar power.\n\nThe Earth-based rectenna would likely consist of many short dipole antennas connected via diodes. Microwave broadcasts from the satellite would be received in the dipoles with about 85% efficiency. With a conventional microwave antenna, the reception efficiency is better, but its cost and complexity are also considerably greater. Rectennas would likely be several kilometers across.\n\nA laser SBSP could also power a base or vehicles on the surface of the Moon or Mars, saving on mass costs to land the power source. A spacecraft or another satellite could also be powered by the same means. In a 2012 report presented to NASA on Space Solar Power, the author mentions another potential use for the technology behind Space Solar Power could be for Solar Electric Propulsion Systems that could be used for interplanetary human exploration missions.\n\nOne problem for the SBSP concept is the cost of space launches and the amount of material that would need to be launched.\n\nMuch of the material launched need not be delivered to its eventual orbit immediately, which raises the possibility that high efficiency (but slower) engines could move SPS material from LEO to GEO at an acceptable cost. Examples include ion thrusters or nuclear propulsion. Power beaming from geostationary orbit by microwaves carries the difficulty that the required 'optical aperture' sizes are very large. For example, the 1978 NASA SPS study required a 1-km diameter transmitting antenna, and a 10 km diameter receiving rectenna, for a microwave beam at 2.45 GHz. These sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths, although they have increased atmospheric absorption and even potential beam blockage by rain or water droplets. Because of the thinned array curse, it is not possible to make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites. The large size of the transmitting and receiving antennas means that the minimum practical power level for an SPS will necessarily be high; small SPS systems will be possible, but uneconomic.\n\nTo give an idea of the scale of the problem, assuming a solar panel mass of 20 kg per kilowatt (without considering the mass of the supporting structure, antenna, or any significant mass reduction of any focusing mirrors) a 4 GW power station would weigh about 80,000 metric tons, all of which would, in current circumstances, be launched from the Earth. Very lightweight designs could likely achieve 1 kg/kW, meaning 4,000 metric tons for the solar panels for the same 4 GW capacity station. This would be the equivalent of between 40 and 150 heavy-lift launch vehicle (HLLV) launches to send the material to low earth orbit, where it would likely be converted into subassembly solar arrays, which then could use high-efficiency ion-engine style rockets to (slowly) reach GEO (Geostationary orbit). With an estimated serial launch cost for shuttle-based HLLVs of $500 million to $800 million, and launch costs for alternative HLLVs at $78 million, total launch costs would range between $11 billion (low cost HLLV, low weight panels) and $320 billion ('expensive' HLLV, heavier panels). To these costs must be added the environmental impact of heavy space launch missions, if such costs are to be used in comparison to earth-based energy production. For comparison, the direct cost of a new coal or nuclear power plant ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion per GW (not including the full cost to the environment from CO2 emissions or storage of spent nuclear fuel, respectively); another example is the Apollo missions to the Moon cost a grand total of $24 billion (1970s dollars), taking inflation into account, would cost $140 billion today, more expensive than the construction of the International Space Station.\n\nGerard O'Neill, noting the problem of high launch costs in the early 1970s, proposed building the SPS's in orbit with materials from the Moon. Launch costs from the Moon are potentially much lower than from Earth, due to the lower gravity and lack of atmospheric drag. This 1970s proposal assumed the then-advertised future launch costing of NASA's space shuttle. This approach would require substantial up front capital investment to establish mass drivers on the Moon. Nevertheless, on 30 April 1979, the Final Report (\"Lunar Resources Utilization for Space Construction\") by General Dynamics' Convair Division, under NASA contract NAS9-15560, concluded that use of lunar resources would be cheaper than Earth-based materials for a system of as few as thirty Solar Power Satellites of 10GW capacity each.\n\nIn 1980, when it became obvious NASA's launch cost estimates for the space shuttle were grossly optimistic, O'Neill et al. published another route to manufacturing using lunar materials with much lower startup costs. This 1980s SPS concept relied less on human presence in space and more on partially self-replicating systems on the lunar surface under remote control of workers stationed on Earth. The high net energy gain of this proposal derives from the Moon's much shallower gravitational well.\n\nHaving a relatively cheap per pound source of raw materials from space would lessen the concern for low mass designs and result in a different sort of SPS being built. The low cost per pound of lunar materials in O'Neill's vision would be supported by using lunar material to manufacture more facilities in orbit than just solar power satellites. Advanced techniques for launching from the Moon may reduce the cost of building a solar power satellite from lunar materials. Some proposed techniques include the lunar mass driver and the lunar space elevator, first described by Jerome Pearson. It would require establishing silicon mining and solar cell manufacturing facilities on the Moon.\n\nPhysicist Dr David Criswell suggests the Moon is the optimum location for solar power stations, and promotes lunar-based solar power. The main advantage he envisions is construction largely from locally available lunar materials, using in-situ resource utilization, with a teleoperated mobile factory and crane to assemble the microwave reflectors, and rovers to assemble and pave solar cells, which would significantly reduce launch costs compared to SBSP designs. Power relay satellites orbiting around earth and the Moon reflecting the microwave beam are also part of the project. A demo project of 1 GW starts at $50 billion. The Shimizu Corporation use combination of lasers and microwave for the Luna Ring concept, along with power relay satellites.\n\nAsteroid mining has also been seriously considered. A NASA design study evaluated a 10,000 ton mining vehicle (to be assembled in orbit) that would return a 500,000 ton asteroid fragment to geostationary orbit. Only about 3,000 tons of the mining ship would be traditional aerospace-grade payload. The rest would be reaction mass for the mass-driver engine, which could be arranged to be the spent rocket stages used to launch the payload. Assuming that 100% of the returned asteroid was useful, and that the asteroid miner itself couldn't be reused, that represents nearly a 95% reduction in launch costs. However, the true merits of such a method would depend on a thorough mineral survey of the candidate asteroids; thus far, we have only estimates of their composition. One proposal is to capture the asteroid Apophis into earth orbit and convert it into 150 solar power satellites of 5 GW each or the larger asteroid 1999 AN10 which is 50x the size of Apophis and large enough to build 7,500 5-Gigawatt Solar Power Satellites\n\nThe use of microwave transmission of power has been the most controversial issue in considering any SPS design. At the Earth's surface, a suggested microwave beam would have a maximum intensity at its center, of 23 mW/cm (less than 1/4 the solar irradiation constant), and an intensity of less than 1 mW/cm outside the rectenna fenceline (the receiver's perimeter). These compare with current United States Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) workplace exposure limits for microwaves, which are 10 mW/cm, - the limit itself being expressed in voluntary terms and ruled unenforceable for Federal OSHA enforcement purposes. A beam of this intensity is therefore at its center, of a similar magnitude to current safe workplace levels, even for long term or indefinite exposure. Outside the receiver, it is far less than the OSHA long-term levels Over 95% of the beam energy will fall on the rectenna. The remaining microwave energy will be absorbed and dispersed well within standards currently imposed upon microwave emissions around the world. It is important for system efficiency that as much of the microwave radiation as possible be focused on the rectenna. Outside the rectenna, microwave intensities rapidly decrease, so nearby towns or other human activity should be completely unaffected.\n\nExposure to the beam is able to be minimized in other ways. On the ground, physical access is controllable (e.g., via fencing), and typical aircraft flying through the beam provide passengers with a protective metal shell (i.e., a Faraday Cage), which will intercept the microwaves. Other aircraft (balloons, ultralight, etc.) can avoid exposure by observing airflight control spaces, as is currently done for military and other controlled airspace. The microwave beam intensity at ground level in the center of the beam would be designed and physically built into the system; simply, the transmitter would be too far away and too small to be able to increase the intensity to unsafe levels, even in principle.\n\nIn addition, a design constraint is that the microwave beam must not be so intense as to injure wildlife, particularly birds. Experiments with deliberate microwave irradiation at reasonable levels have failed to show negative effects even over multiple generations. Suggestions have been made to locate rectennas offshore, but this presents serious problems, including corrosion, mechanical stresses, and biological contamination.\n\nA commonly proposed approach to ensuring fail-safe beam targeting is to use a retrodirective phased array antenna/rectenna. A \"pilot\" microwave beam emitted from the center of the rectenna on the ground establishes a phase front at the transmitting antenna. There, circuits in each of the antenna's subarrays compare the pilot beam's phase front with an internal clock phase to control the phase of the outgoing signal. This forces the transmitted beam to be centered precisely on the rectenna and to have a high degree of phase uniformity; if the pilot beam is lost for any reason (if the transmitting antenna is turned away from the rectenna, for example) the phase control value fails and the microwave power beam is automatically defocused. Such a system would be physically incapable of focusing its power beam anywhere that did not have a pilot beam transmitter. The long-term effects of beaming power through the ionosphere in the form of microwaves has yet to be studied, but nothing has been suggested which might lead to any significant effect.\n\n\n\nThe typical reference system-of-systems involves a significant number (several thousand multi-gigawatt systems to service all or a significant portion of Earth's energy requirements) of individual satellites in GEO. The typical reference design for the individual satellite is in the 1-10 GW range and usually involves planar or concentrated solar photovoltaics (PV) as the energy collector / conversion. The most typical transmission designs are in the 1–10 GHz (2.45 or 5.8 GHz) RF band where there are minimum losses in the atmosphere. Materials for the satellites are sourced from, and manufactured on Earth and expected to be transported to LEO via re-usable rocket launch, and transported between LEO and GEO via chemical or electrical propulsion. In summary, the architecture choices are: \nThere are several interesting design variants from the reference system:\n\nAlternate energy collection location: While GEO is most typical because of its advantages of nearness to Earth, simplified pointing and tracking, very small time in occultation, and scalability to meet all global demand several times over, other locations have been proposed:\nEnergy Collection: The most typical designs for Solar Power Satellites include photovoltaics. These may be planar (and usually passively cooled), concentrated (and perhaps actively cooled). However, there are multiple interesting variants. \nAlternate Satellite Architecture: The typical satellite is a monolithic structure composed of a structural truss, one or more collectors, one or more transmitters, and occasionally primary and secondary reflectors. The entire structure may be gravity gradient stabilized. Alternative designs include:\nTransmission: The most typical design for energy transmission is via an RF antenna at below 10 GHz to a rectenna on the ground. Controversy exists between the benefits of Klystrons, Gyrotrons, Magnetrons and solid state. Alternate transmission approaches include:\nMaterials and Manufacturing: Typical designs make use of the developed industrial manufacturing system extant on Earth, and use Earth based materials both for the satellite and propellant. Variants include:\nMethod of Installation / Transportation of Material to Energy Collection Location: In the reference designs, component material is launched via well-understood chemical rockets (usually fully reusable launch systems) to LEO, after which either chemical or electrical propulsion is used to carry them to GEO. The desired characteristics for this system is very high mass-flow at low total cost. Alternate concepts include:\n\nSpace stations transmitting solar power have appeared in science-fiction works like Isaac Asimov's \"Reason\" (1941), that centers around the troubles caused by the robots operating the station. Asimov's short story \"The Last Question\" also features the use of SBSP to provide limitless energy for use on Earth. \n\nIn Ben Bova's novel \"PowerSat\" (2005), an entrepreneur strives to proof that his company's nearly completed power satellite and spaceplane (a means of getting maintenance crews to the satellite efficiently) are both safe and economically viable, while terrorists with ties to oil producing nations attempt to derail these attempts through subterfuge and sabotage.\n\nVarious aerospace companies have also showcased imaginative future solar power satellites in their corporate vision videos, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and United Launch Alliance.\n\nThe National Space Society maintains an extensive Space Solar Power Library of all major historical documents and studies associated with space solar power, and major news articles.\n\n\n"}

The most important thermophysical property is thermal inertia, which controls the amplitude of the thermal curve and albedo (or reflectivity), which controls the average temperature.\n\nThis field of observations and computer modeling was first applied to Mars due to the ideal atmospheric pressure for characterizing granular materials based upon temperature [Wechsler and Glaser, 1965]. The Mariner 6, Mariner 7, and Mariner 9 spacecraft carried thermal infrared radiometers [Neugebauer, et al., 1971; Kieffer et al., 1973], and a global map of thermal inertia was produced from modeled surface temperatures [Kieffer, et al., 1977] collected by the Infrared Thermal Mapper Instruments (IRTM) on board the Viking 1 and 2 Orbiters.\n\nThe original thermophysical models were based upon the studies of lunar temperature variations by Wesselink [1948] and Jaeger [1953]. Further development of the models for Mars included surface-atmosphere energy transfer [Leovy, 1966], atmospheric back-radiation [Neugebauer et al., 1971], surface emissivity variations [Kieffer et al., 1973], CO2 frost and blocky surfaces [Kieffer et al., 1977], variability of atmospheric back-radiation [Haberle and Jakosky, 1991], effects of a radiative-convective atmosphere [Hayashi et al., 1995], and single-point temperature observations [Jakosky et al., 2000; Mellon et al., 2000].\n\nWechsler, A.E., and P.E.

For instance as oceans are warming and becoming more acidic, biodiversity is becoming reduced and changing currents will cause more frequent storms and droughts. Every year around 8 million metric tons of plastic waste leak into the ocean and make it into the circular ocean currents. This causes contamination of sediments at the sea-bottom and causes plastic waste to be embedded in the aquatic food chain. It could lead to oceans containing more plastics than fish by 2050 if nothing is done. Key habitats such as coral reefs are at risk and noise pollution are a threat to whales, dolphins, and other species. Furthermore almost 90 percent of fish stocks are overfished or fully exploited which cost more than $80 billion a year in lost revenues.\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that decisive, coordinated global action can solve the problems created by Humanity. Peter Thomson, President of the UN General Assembly, highlighted the conference's significance, saying \"if we want a secure future for our species on this planet, we have to act now on the health of the ocean and on climate change\".\nThe conference sought to find ways and urge for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14. Its theme is \"Our oceans, our future: partnering for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14\". It also asked governments, UN bodies, and civil society groups to make voluntary commitments for action to improve the health of the oceans with over 1,000 commitments − such as on managing protected areas − being made.\n\nParticipants include heads of State and Government, civil society representatives, business people, actors, academics and scientists and ocean and marine life advocates from around 200 countries. Around 6,000 leaders gathered for the conference over the course of the week.\nThe Governments of Fiji and Sweden had the co-hosting responsibilities of the Conference.\n\n7 partnership dialogues with a rich state-developed state theme were co-chaired by Australia-Kenya, Iceland-Peru, Canada-Senegal, Estonia-Grenada, Italy-Palau, Monaco-Mozambique and Norway-Indonesia.\nMinisters from small island states such as Palau, Fiji and Tuvalu pleaded for help as for them the issue is existential not just on the long-term.\n\nOver 1,300 voluntary commitments have been made which UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Wu Hongbo called \"truly impressive\" and stated that they now comprise \"an ocean solution registry\" via the public online platform. 44 percent of the commitments came from governments, 19 percent from NGOs, 9 percent from UN entities and 6 percent from the private sector.\nDelegates from China, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines pledged to work to keep plastics out of the seas. The Maldives announced a phase out of its non-biodegradable plastic and Austria pledged to reduce the number of plastic bags used per person to 25 a year by 2019.\nSeveral nations announced plans for new marine protected areas. China plans to establish 10 to 20 \"demonstration zones\" by 2020 and introduced a regulation which requires that 35 percent of the country's shoreline should be natural by 2020. Gabon announced that it will create one of Africa's largest marine protected areas with around 53,000 square kilometres of ocean when combined with its existing zones. New Zealand affirmed the government's commitment to establishing the Kermadec/Rangitahua Ocean Sanctuary, which − with 620,000 square kilometres − would be one of the world's largest fully protected areas. Pakistan also announced its first marine protected area.\nThe US-based international wildlife organisation Wildlife Conservation Society created the MPA Fund in 2016 as well as the blue moon fund for a combined $15 million commitment which aims to create 3.7 million square kilometers of new marine protected areas with The Tiffany & Co. Foundation adding a $1 million grant toward this fund in the week of the conference. Germany's Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety Barbara Hendricks also pledged to allocate €670 million for marine conservation projects and made 11 voluntary commitments.\nDeputy Director-General of the State Oceanic Administrations Lin Shanqing of China − the world's main fish producer and exporter − stated that the country would be \"willing, based on its own development experience, to work actively for the establishment in the area of the ocean of an open, inclusive, concrete, pragmatic, mutually beneficial and win-win blue partnership with other countries and international organizations\".\nThe conference ended with the adoption by consensus of a 14-point Call for Action by the 193 UN member states in which they affirmed their \"strong commitment to conserve and sustainably use our oceans, seas and marine resources tor sustainable development\". With this call, the Ocean Conference also sought to raise global awareness of ocean problems.\n\nOn 9 June an official side event of the United Nations Ocean Conference for addressing ways by which the private sector provides practical solutions to address the problems such as by improving energy efficiency, waste management and introducing market-based tools to shift investment, subsidy and production.\nNine of the world's biggest fishing companies from Asia, Europe and the US have signed up for The Seafood Business for Ocean Stewardship (SeaBOS) initiative, supported by the Stockholm Resilience Centre, aiming to end unsustainable practices.\n\nAt the conference Indonesia published its Vessel monitoring system (VMS) publicly revealing the location and activity of its commercial fishing boats on the Global Fishing Watch public mapping platform. Brian Sullivan states that the platform is can easily incorporate additional data sources which may allow \"mov[ing] from raw data to quickly producing dynamic visualizations and reporting that promote scientific discovery and support policies for better fishery management\".\nIrina Bokova of UNESCO notes that \"we cannot manage what we cannot measure, and no single country is able to measure the myriad changes taking place in the ocean\", and asks for more maritime research and the sharing of knowledge to craft common science-based policies.\nPeru co-chaired the \"Partnership Dialogue 6 – Increasing scientific knowledge, and developing research capacity and transfer of marine technology\" with Iceland.\nOn 7 June researchers at the Dutch The Ocean Cleanup foundation published a study according to which rivers − such as the Yangtze − carry an around 1.15–2.41 million tonnes of plastic into the sea every year.\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that unless nations overcome short-term territorial and resource interests the state of the oceans will continue to deteriorate. He also names \"the artificial dichotomy\" between jobs and healthy oceans as one of the main challenges and asks for strong political leadership, new partnerships and concrete steps.\n\nDeputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Amina J Mohammed warns about the harm of overlooking the climate concerns in turn for perceived \"national gain\", claiming that \"a moral obligation to the world which [one] live[s] on\" exists.\nIndia, attended indirectly via two non-governmental organisations until 9 June when Minister of State for External Affairs M J Akbar told the conference that the negative impact of overfishing, habitat destruction, pollution and climate change are becoming increasingly clear and that the time for action would be \"already long overdue\".\nBolivia's President Evo Morales told the conference that, one of the world's main polluters, the United States denied science, turned its backs on multilateralism, and attempted to deny a future to upcoming generations by its national government deciding to leave the Paris agreement, making \"it the main threat to Mother Earth and life itself\". Albert II, Prince of Monaco called Trump's withdrawal \"catastrophic\" and the reaction from US mayors, governors and many in the corporate world as \"wonderful\". On 30 May Sweden's deputy prime minister Isabella Lövin stated that the United States is resisting plans to highlight how climate change is disrupting life in the oceans at the conference, that the US has negatively affected preparations and that \"the decline of the oceans is really a threat to the entire planet\" with a \"need to start working together\". Lovin also makes note of difficulties to engage with Washington in the conference, partly because key posts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration remain unfilled since the end of the Obama administration.\nUNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi states that subsidies from wealthy governments encourage overfishing, overcapacity and may contribute to illegal and unregulated fishing, creating food insecurity, unemployment and poverty for people relying mainly on fish as their primary source of nourishment or livelihood.\n\nMarine biologist Ayana Elizabeth Johnson notes that the UN's work alone is not nearly enough and that for a solution to this existential crisis of the health of our global environment, strong and inspired leadership at all levels – from mayors, to governors, CEOs, scientists, artists and presidents is needed.\nIn 2010 the international community agreed to protect 10% of the ocean by 2020 in the Convention on Biological Diversity's Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 and Sustainable\nDevelopment Goal 14. However as of June 2017 less than 3% of the ocean are under some form of protection. Pledges made during the conference would add around an additional 4.4 percent of protected marine areas, increasing the protected total to around 7.4% of the ocean.\nPeter Thomson called the conference was a success, stating that he was \"satisfied with [its] results\", that the conference \"held at a very critical time\" has \"turned the tide on marine pollution\". He says that \"we are now working around the world to restore a relationship of balance and respect towards the ocean\".\nElizabeth Wilson, director of international conservation at Pew Charitable Trusts thinks that this meeting \"will be followed by a whole series of other meetings that we hope will be impacted in a positive way\".\n\nThe next conference is scheduled for 2020. Portugal's Minister for the Seas, Ana Paula Vitorino stated that Lisbon would like to host the next event in 2020. Kenya's Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed also offered for Keyna to host the next event.\n\nThe event coincided with the World Oceans Day on 8 June and started with the World Environment Day on 5 June.\nOn 4 June the World Ocean Festival took place at New York City's Governors Island. The festival was hosted by the City of New York, organized by the Global Brain Foundation and was free and open to the public.\nChina announced a new international sailing competition and Noahs Sailing Club press officer Rebecca Wang stated that \"sailing allows for a better appreciation of the ocean and the natural environment. Many wealthy Chinese think of luxury yachts when they think of maritime sports, and we're trying to foster a maritime culture that's more attuned to the environment\".\nUsers of social media worldwide use the hashtag #SaveOurOcean for discussion, information and media related to the conference and its goals. The #CleanSeas cyber campaign calls on governments, industry and citizens to end excessive, wasteful usage of single-use plastic and eliminate microplastics in cosmetics with its petition getting signed by more than 1 million people.\n\n"}

They were initially founded as a means of using unproductive land. Little regard was given to modern conservation values, but once these evolved, the country became a world leader in wildlife management.\n\nThe first proclaimed game reserve was Wankie (now Hwange), formed in 1928 and upgraded in the 1949 National Parks Act. The then-Rhodesia's game section was originally formed in 1952 as a subsidiary of the Department of Mines, Lands and Surveys. This was the nucleus that became the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Management in 1964.\n\nThe Parks and Wildlife Act of 1975 established the agency. It was a quintessential breakthrough for conservation. The core philosophy of how people perceived wildlife was changed. Under the act, ownership of wildlife passed from the state to whoever owned the land the animal lived on.\n\nWhen the landowners (both communal and private) became custodians of the wildlife, a change in mindset occurred. People began to see their wildlife resources as an asset to be nurtured, ensuring their benefits continued into the future. Gradually, fence-breaking elephant and zebra were not viewed as nuisances to be eradicated; herds of impala were no longer a quick, easy meal.\n\nWithin the Parks and Wildlife Act, various levels were defined at which state-owned land was to be protected and utilised. Gone was the old Game Department that issued hunting licences which, for a nominal fee, allowed settlers to hunt wildlife in all areas but a few game reserves. A system of national parks, botanical reserves and gardens, sanctuaries, recreational parks and safari areas was set firmly in place. Since 1975, the act has been amended and refined, allowing the evolution of a dynamic wildlife-protection process.\n\nMany African countries have since adopted this philosophy. So far-reaching was the concept of the original act that it now enshrines many aspects of grassroots conservation being implemented worldwide. Communal or traditional tribal areas and privately owned land were also categorised for different levels of utilisation.\n\nCommunal areas harbouring significant wildlife resources or bordering national parks were given Appropriate Authority status through their Rural Councils, and as a result the Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources was born. CAMPFIRE has developed into an important conservation strategy, ensuring that significant financial earnings revert to rural communities for their benefit. This philosophy has been adopted on a pan-African basis and is slowly being implemented in Asia and South America as well.\n\nMany of Zimbabwe's national parks, such as Victoria Falls, Mana Pools and Hwange, are renowned worldwide, though the country also has lesser-known gems such as Chizarira and Gonarezhou. Parts of the Rhodes Estate, established in Rhodes' will of 1902, were bequeathed to the nation for farming, forestry and agricultural research. This land later became part of the rocky Matobo and mountainous Nyanga National Parks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
