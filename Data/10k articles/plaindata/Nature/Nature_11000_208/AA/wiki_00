The gyro-frequency ranges from 0.6 kHz to about 1.6 kHz. Distinguishable on high resolution wideband spectrographs, the wave amplitude grows linearly then switches to non-linear. Demonstrating a peak distribution near dawn, the auroral chorus is most detectable via ELF/VLF Radio receivers in the middle latitude around 30-60 degrees N. The most numerous recordings of the auroral chorus has been by the Iowa Plasma Wave Group. They have released many audio interpretations of chorus recordings online along with spectrograph measurements. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3601582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3601582", "title": "Biblical Mount Sinai", "text": "Biblical Mount Sinai\n\nAccording to the Book of Exodus, Mount Sinai (Hebrew: הר סיני, \"Har Sinai\") is the mountain at which the Ten Commandments were given to Moses by God. In the Book of Deuteronomy, these events are described as having transpired at Mount Horeb. \"Sinai\" and \"Horeb\" are generally considered to refer to the same place by scholars.\n\nHebrew Bible texts describe the theophany at Mount Sinai in terms which a minority of scholars, following Charles Beke (1873), have suggested may literally describe the mountain as a volcano and have led to a search for alternative locations.\n\nAccording to the Documentary hypothesis, the name \"Sinai\" is only used in the Torah by the Jahwist and Priestly source, whereas \"Horeb\" is only used by the Elohist and Deuteronomist.\n\nHoreb is thought to mean \"glowing/heat\", which seems to be a reference to the sun, while \"Sinai\" may have derived from the name of \"Sin\", the Sumerian deity of the moon, and thus Sinai and Horeb would be the mountains of the moon and sun, respectively.\n\nRegarding the Sumerian \"Sin\" deity assumption, William F. Albright, an American biblical scholar, had stated:\n\nAccording to Rabbinic tradition, the name \"Sinai\" derives from \"sin-ah\" (), meaning \"hatred\", in reference to the other nations hating the Jews out of jealousy, due to the Jews being the ones to receive the word of God.\n\nClassical rabbinic literature mentions the mountain having other names:\nAlso:\n\nAccording to the biblical account of the giving of the instructions and teachings of both the Written and the Oral Torah, Sinai was enveloped in a cloud, it quaked and was filled with smoke, while lightning-flashes shot forth, and the roar of thunder mingled with the blasts of a trumpet; the account later adds that fire was seen burning at the summit of the mountain. In the biblical account, the fire and clouds are a direct consequence of the arrival of God upon the mountain. According to the biblical story, Moses departed to the mountain and stayed there for 40 days and nights in order to receive the Ten Commandments, the Written and the Oral Torah, and he did so twice because he broke the first set of the tablets of stone after returning from the mountain for the first time.\n\nThe biblical description of God's descent seems to be in conflict with the statement shortly after that God spoke to the Israelites from Heaven. While biblical scholars argue that these passages are from different sources, the \"Mekhilta\" argues that God had lowered the heavens and spread them over Sinai, and the \"Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer\" argues that a hole was torn in the heavens, and Sinai was torn away from the earth and the summit pushed through the hole. 'The heavens' could be a metaphor for clouds and the 'lake of fire' could be a metaphor for the lava-filled crater. Several bible critics have indicated that the smoke and fire reference from the Bible suggests that Mt Sinai was a volcano; despite the absence of ash. Other bible scholars have suggested that the description fits a storm especially as the Song of Deborah seems to allude to rain having occurred at the time. According to the biblical account, God spoke directly to the Israelite nation as a whole.\n\nSome modern biblical scholars explain Mount Sinai as having been a sacred place dedicated to one of the Semitic deities, even before the Israelites encountered it. Others regard the set of laws given on the mountain to have originated in different time periods from one another, with the later ones mainly being the result of natural evolution over the centuries of the earlier ones, rather than all originating from a single moment in time.\n\nModern scholars differ as to the exact geographical position of Mount Sinai, and the same has long been true of scholars of Judaism. The Elijah narrative appears to suggest that when it was written, the location of \"Horeb\" was still known with some certainty, as Elijah is described as travelling to Horeb on one occasion, but there are no later biblical references to it that suggest the location remained known; Josephus only specifies that it was within Arabia Petraea (a Roman Province encompassing modern Jordan, southern modern Syria, the Sinai Peninsula and northwestern Saudi Arabia with its capital in Petra), and the Pauline Epistles are even more vague, specifying only that it was in Arabia, which covers most of the south-western Middle east.\n\nThe earliest references to Jebel Musa as Mount Sinai or Mount Sinai being located in the present day Sinai Peninsula are inconclusive. There is evidence that prior to 100 CE, well before the Christian monastic period, Jewish sages equated Jebel Musa with Mount Sinai. Graham Davies of Cambridge University argues that early Jewish pilgrimages identified Jebel Musa as Mount Sinai and this identification was later adopted by the Christian pilgrims. R. K. Harrison states that, “Jebel Musa . . . seems to have enjoyed special sanctity long before Christian times, culminating in its identification with Mt. Sinai.\" In the second and third centuries BCE Nabataeans were making pilgrimages there, which is indicated in part by inscriptions discovered in the area.\n\nJosephus wrote that \"Moses went up to a mountain that lay between Egypt and Arabia, which was called Sinai.\" Josephus says that Sinai is \"the highest of all the mountains thereabout,\" and is \"the highest of all the mountains that are in that country, and is not only very difficult to be ascended by men, on account of its vast altitude but because of the sharpness of its precipices\". The traditional Mount Sinai, located in the Sinai Peninsula, is actually the name of a collection of peaks, sometimes referred to as the Holy Mountain peaks which consist of Jebel Musa, Mount Catherine and Ras Sufsafeh. Etheria (circa 4th century CE) wrote, \"The whole mountain group looks as if it were a single peak, but, as you enter the group, [you see that] there are more than one.\" The highest mountain peak is Mount Catherine, rising above the sea and its sister peak, Jebel Musa (), is not much further behind in height, but is more conspicuous because of the open plain called \"er Rachah\" (\"the wide\"). Mount Catherine and Jebel Musa are both much higher than any mountains in the Sinaitic desert, or in all of Midian. The highest tops in the Tih desert to the north are not much over . Those in Midian, East of Elath, rise only to . Even Jebel Serbal, west of Sinai, is at its highest only above the sea.\n\nSome scholars believe that Mount Sinai was of ancient sanctity prior to the ascent of Moses described in the Bible. Scholars have theorized that Sinai in part derived its name from the word for moon which was \"sin\" (meaning \"the moon\" or \"to shine\"). Antoninus Martyr provides some support for the ancient sanctity of Jebel Musa by writing that Arabian heathens were still celebrating moon feasts there in the 6th century. Lina Eckenstien states that some of the artifacts discovered indicate that \"the establishment of the moon-cult in the peninsula dates back to the pre-dynastic days of Egypt.\" She says the main center of moon worship seems to have been concentrated in the southern Sinai peninsula which the Egyptians seized from the Semitic people who had built shrines and mining camps there. Robinson says that inscriptions with pictures of moon worship objects are found all over the southern peninsula but are missing on Jebel Musa and Mount Catherine. This oddity may suggest religious cleansing.\n\nGroups of \"nawamis\" have been discovered in southern Sinai, creating a kind of ring around Jebel Musa. The \"nawamis\" were used over and over throughout the centuries for various purposes. Etheria, circa the 4th/5th century CE, noted that her guides, who were the local \"holy men\", pointed out these round or circular stone foundations of temporary huts, claiming the children of Israel used them during their stay there.\n\nThe southern Sinai Peninsula contains archaeological discoveries but to place them with the exodus from Egypt is a daunting task inasmuch as the proposed dates of the Exodus vary so widely. The Exodus has been dated from the Early Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age II.\n\nEgyptian pottery in the southern Sinai during the Late Bronze and Early Iron I (Ramesside) periods has been discovered at the mining camps of Serabit el-Khadim and Timna. Objects which bore Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions, the same as those found in Canaan, were discovered at Serabit el Khadim in the Southern Sinai. Several of these were dated in the later Bronze Age. These encampments provide evidence of miners from southern Canaan. The remote site of Serabit el-Khadem was used for a few months at a time, every couple of years at best, more often once in a generation. The journey to the mines was long, difficult and dangerous. Expeditions headed by Professor Mazar examined the tell of Feiran, the principal oasis, of southern Sinai and discovered the site abounded not only in Nabatean sherds but in wheel-burnished sherds typical of the Kingdom of Judah, belonging to Iron Age II.\n\nEdward Robinson insisted that the Plain of ar-Raaha adjacent to Jebel Musa could have accommodated the Israelites. Edward Hull stated that, \"this traditional Sinai in every way meets the requirements of the narrative of the Exodus.\" Hull agreed with Robinson and stated he had no further doubts after studying the great amphitheater leading to the base of the granite cliff of Ras Sufsafeh, that here indeed was the location of the camp and the mount from which the laws of God was delivered to the encampment of Israelites below.\n\nF. W. Holland stated (Recovery of Jerusalem, 524): \"With regard to water-supply there is no other spot in the whole Peninsula which is nearly so well supplied as the neighborhood of Jebel Musa. ... There is also no other district in the Peninsula which affords such excellent pasturage.\"\nCalculating the travels of the Israelites, the Bible Atlas states, \"These distances will not, however, allow of our placing Sinai farther East than Jebel Musa.\"\n\nSome point to the absence of material evidence left behind in the journey of the Israelites but Dr. Beit-Arieh wrote, \"Perhaps it will be argued, by those who subscribe to the traditional account in the Bible, that the Israelite material culture was only of the flimsiest kind and left no trace. Presumably the Israelite dwellings and artifacts consisted only of perishable materials.\" Hoffmeier wrote, \"None of the encampments of the wilderness wanderings can be meaningful if the Israelites went directly to either Kadesh or Midian ... a journey of eleven days from Kadesh to Horeb can be properly understood only in relationship to the southern portion of the Sinai Peninsula.\"\n\nLocal Bedouins who have long inhabited the area have identified Jebel Musa as Mount Sinai. In the fourth century CE small settlements of monks set up places of worship around Jebel Musa. An Egyptian pilgrim named Ammonius, who had in past times made various visits to the area, identified Jebel Musa as the Holy Mount in the 4th century. Empress Helena, ca. 330 CE, built a church to protect monks against raids from nomads. She chose the site for the church from the identification which had been handed down through generations through the Bedouins. She also reported the site was confirmed to her in a dream.\n\nThe Sinai peninsula has traditionally been considered Sinai's location by Christians, although the peninsula gained its name from this tradition, and was not called that in Josephus' time or earlier. (The Sinai was earlier inhabited by the Monitu and was called \"Mafkat\" or \"Country of Turquoise\".) In early Christian times, a number of Anchorites settled on Mount Serbal, considering it to be the biblical mountain, and in the 4th century a monastery was constructed at its base. Nevertheless, Josephus had stated that Mount Sinai was \"the highest of all the mountains thereabout\", which would imply that Mount Catherine was actually the mountain in question, if Sinai was to be sited on the Sinai peninsula at all. In the 6th century, Saint Catherine's Monastery was constructed at the base of this mountain at a site which is claimed to be the site of the biblical burning bush.\n\nUnlike these Christian traditions, Bedouin tradition considered Jabal Musa, which lies adjacent to Mount Catherine, to be the biblical mountain, and it is this mountain that local tour groups and religious groups presently advertise as \"the\" biblical Mount Sinai. Evidently this view was eventually taken up by Christian groups as well, as in the 16th century a church was constructed at the peak of this mountain, which was replaced by a Greek Orthodox chapel in 1954.\n\nAccording to textual scholars, in the JE version of the Exodus narrative, the Israelites travel in a roughly straight line to Kadesh Barnea from the \"Yam Suph\" (literally meaning \"the Reed Sea\", but considered traditionally to refer to the Red sea), and the detour via the south of the Sinai peninsula is only present in the Priestly Source. A number of scholars and commentators have therefore looked towards the more central and northern parts of the Sinai peninsula for the mountain. Mount Sin Bishar, in the west-central part of the peninsula, was proposed to be the biblical Mount Sinai by Menashe Har-El, a biblical geographer at Tel Aviv University. Mount Helal, in the north of the peninsula has also been proposed. Another northern Sinai suggestion is Hashem el-Tarif, some 30 km west of Eilat, Israel.\n\nSince Moses is described by the Bible as encountering Jethro, a Kenite who was a Midianite priest, shortly before encountering Sinai, this suggests that Sinai would be somewhere near their territory in Saudi Arabia; the Kenites and Midianites appear to have resided east of the Gulf of Aqaba. Additionally, the Song of Deborah, which some textual scholars consider one of the oldest parts of the Bible, portrays God as having dwelt at Mount Seir, and seems to suggest that this equates with Mount Sinai; Mount Seir designates the mountain range in the centre of Edom.\n\nBased on a number of local names and features, in 1927 Ditlef Nielsen identified the \"Jebel al-Madhbah\" (meaning \"mountain of the Altar\") at Petra as being identical to the biblical Mount Sinai; since then other scholars have also made the identification.\n\nThe valley in which Petra resides is known as the \"Wadi Musa\", meaning \"valley of Moses\", and at the entrance to the Siq is the Ain Musa, meaning \"spring of Moses\"; the 13th century Arab chronicler Numari stated that Ain Musa was the location where Moses had brought water from the ground, by striking it with his rod. The Jebel al-Madhbah was evidently considered particularly sacred, as the well known ritual building known as \"The Treasury\" is carved into its base, the mountain top is covered with a number of different altars, and over 8 metres of the original peak were carved away to leave a flat surface with two 8 metre tall obelisks sticking out of it; these obelisks, which frame the end of the path leading up to them, and are now only 6 metres tall, have led to the mountain being colloquially known as \"Zibb 'Atuf\", meaning \"penis of love\" in Arabic. Archaeological artifacts discovered at the top of the mountain indicate that it was once covered by polished shiny blue slate, fitting with the biblical description of \"paved work of sapphire stone\"; biblical references to \"sapphire\" are considered by scholars to be unlikely to refer to the stone called \"sapphire\" in modern times, as \"sapphire\" had a different meaning, and wasn't even mined, before the Roman era. Unfortunately, the removal of the original peak has destroyed most other archaeological remains from the late Bronze Age (the standard dating of the Exodus) that might previously have been present.\n\nA suggested possible naturalistic explanation of the biblical \"devouring fire\" is that Sinai could have been an erupting volcano; this has been suggested by Charles Beke, Sigmund Freud, and Immanuel Velikovsky, among others. This possibility would exclude all the peaks on the Sinai peninsula and Seir, but would make a number of locations in north western Saudi Arabia reasonable candidates. In 1873, Charles Beke proposed that Sinai was the \"Jabal al-Nour\" (meaning \"mountain of light\"), a volcanic mountain at the northern end of the Gulf of Aqaba, and which has great significance in Islam for other reasons; Beke died the following year, but his writings (published posthumously) retracted this identification four years later in favour of Jebel Baggir, with Horeb being argued to be a different mountain - the nearby Jebel Ertowa. Beke's suggestions have not found as much scholarly support as the candidature of Hala-'l Badr; the equation of Sinai with Hala-'l Badr has been advocated by Alois Musil in the early 20th century, Jean Koenig in 1971, and Colin Humphreys in 2003, among others.\n\nThe possibility of an alternate site located in Saudi Arabia has also drawn attention due to the Apostle Paul's assertion in the first century that Mount Sinai was located in Arabia, although in Paul's time, the region of Arabia Petraea would have included both the modern Sinai peninsula and northwestern Saudi Arabia. A possible candidate within the Arabia theory has been that of \"Jabal al-Lawz\" (meaning 'mountain of almonds'). Advocates for Jabal al-Lawz include Lennart Moller (a Swedish professor in environmental medicine) and also Ron Wyatt, Bob Cornuke and Larry Williams. Allen Kerkeslager, associate professor of Theology at St. Joseph's University believes that the archaeological evidence is too tenuous to draw conclusions but has stated that \"Jabal al Lawz may also be the most convincing option for identifying the Mt. Sinai of biblical tradition\" and should be researched. A number of researchers support this hypothesis while others dispute it.\n\nJabal al-Lawz has been rejected by scholars such as James K. Hoffmeier (Professor of Old Testament and Ancient Near Eastern History and Archaeology) who details what he calls Cornuke's \"monumental blunders\" and others. Gordon Franz, a professional researcher, has studied this topic in depth and has published a refutation of this hypothesis.\n\nWhile equating Sinai with Petra would indicate that the Israelites journeyed in roughly a straight line from Egypt via Kadesh Barnea, and locating Sinai in Saudi Arabia would suggest Kadesh Barnea was skirted to the south, some scholars have wondered whether Sinai was much closer to the vicinity of Kadesh Barnea itself. Halfway between Kadesh Barnea and Petra, in the southwest Negev desert in Israel, is \"Har Karkom\", which Emmanuel Anati excavated, and discovered to have been a major Paleolithic cult centre, with the surrounding plateau covered with shrines, altars, stone circles, stone pillars, and over 40,000 rock engravings; although the peak of religious activity at the site dates to 2350–2000 BCE, the exodus is dated 15 Nisan 2448 (Hebrew calendar; 1313 BCE), and the mountain appears to have been abandoned between 1950–1000 BCE, Anati proposed that Jabal Ideid was equatable with biblical Sinai. Other scholars have criticised this identification, as, in addition to being almost 1000 years too early, it also appears to require the wholesale relocation of the Midianites, Amalekites, and other ancient peoples, from the locations where the majority of scholars currently place them.\n\n\n"}

From advancing the off-grid solar technologies bringing power to energy-impoverished people, to cutting the catastrophic climate impacts of air conditioning, CLASP programs increase uptake of affordable, low-impact, high-quality appliances.\n\nAppliances are a big part of our lives. Smart phones keep us connected. Heating, cooling, and lighting improve productivity and safety. Refrigeration protects the food we harvest and eat. Without much thought, we interact with energy- and resource-consuming products every day.\n\nThough appliances improve lives and livelihoods, they also use energy and other essential resources. Recent analyses indicate that air conditioning, not cars, pose the greatest threat to our planet. As millions of households in developing and emerging economies have the financial resources to control their indoor climate for the first time, the world is poised to install 700 million new room air conditioners by 2030 and 1.6 billion by 2050. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, that’s like adding several large countries to the planet.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 3 billion people prepare their meals on inefficient, pre-modern cookstoves, or over open fires, using charcoal and biomass. An estimated 1.2 billion people around the globe lack access to electricity entirely—another billion have only unreliable access. Energy poverty is a major barrier to social and economic development, and the emissions generated by inefficient and dirty cooking and lighting methods pose serious health risks, especially to women and children, and are powerful climate forcers. For most households living beyond the grid, electrification is too long coming, and for most governments, total electrification is far too expensive and resource-intensive.\n\nOn the grid, energy efficient appliances are one of the most cost-effective methods for mitigating climate change. They save money for governments and consumers alike, reduce peak energy demand, and bolster economic and energy security. Off the grid, energy efficient appliances pair with solar-home systems or mini-grids to increase the availability and affordability of energy. Radically reducing the cost of off-grid energy through efficient appliances improves educational, health, and economic outcomes for the world’s poorest people, while moving all of us closer to a cleaner, renewably-powered energy economy.\n\nCLASP was created in 1999 as a strategic cooperation of three organization – the Alliance to Save Energy (ASE), the International Institute for Energy Conservation (IIEC), and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).

We work hand-in-hand with governments to structure rigorous energy and quality standards that promote innovation and competition, and with manufacturers, consumers, and others to label and deploy stand-out products.\n\nMarket Development & Innovation – Incentivizing good appliances to buyers up and down the supply chain reduces risk for everyone, and builds up markets that are weak or disorganized. Innovative products – from refrigeration for off-grid consumers to the switch to DC power and the internet of things – are game changers for how we all use energy.\n\nGlobal Collaboration – CLASP serves at the epicenter of ambitious and collaborative efforts to prevent catastrophic climate change and make the world sustainable for all.

Requires each such unit to: (1) be located at a different electric generating station in the United States, (2) be representative of the operating characteristics of electric generation at its location, and (3) be operated for the entire 12-month period on a full commercial basis. Prohibits the use of any results obtained from a demonstration project in setting the standard.\n\nThe bill would require the Administrator, in separating sources fueled with coal into a separate category, to establish a separate subcategory for new sources that are fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units using coal with an average heat content of 8300 or less British Thermal Units (BTUs) per pound.\n\nThe bill would prohibit the Administrator, in issuing any rule establishing performance standards for greenhouse gas emissions from new sources in such subcategory, from setting a standard based on the best system of emission reduction unless the standard has been achieved on average for at least one continuous 12-month period (excluding planned outages) by each of at least 3 units within such subcategory that meets the unit requirements specified by this Act for the coal category.\n\nThe bill would preclude from taking effect, unless a federal law is enacted specifying an effective date, any EPA rule or guideline that: (1) establishes any performance standard for greenhouse gas emissions from a modified or reconstructed source that is a fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating unit, or (2) applies to greenhouse gas emissions from such an existing source.\n\nThe bill would nullify the force and effect of specified proposed rules (or similar successor proposed or final rules) for Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units that are issued before enactment of this Act.\n\n\"This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on January 28, 2014. This is a public domain source.\"\n\nOn January 8, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule that would establish uniform national limits on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from new electricity-generating facilities that use coal or natural gas. The rule also sets new standards of performance for those power plants, including the requirement to install carbon capture and sequestration technology. H.R. 3826 would repeal this pending rule and place new requirements on any future regulations addressing GHG emissions from new or existing power plants.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing this legislation would cost $2 million over the 2015-2019 period, subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Enacting H.R. 3826 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.\n\nH.R. 3826 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.\n\nThe Electricity Security and Affordability Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on January 9, 2014, by Rep. Ed Whitfield (R, KY-1). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power. It was reported by the committee on February 28, 2014 alongside House Report 113-365. On February 29, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 3826 would be considered on March 5, 2014. The bill passed the House on March 6, 2014 in a vote of 229-183.\n\nRepublicans thought the bill was needed to stop the EPA from implementing a rule that would force new coal-fired power plants to meet an impossible emissions standard. Bill sponsor Ed Whitfield (R-KY) said that, if finalized, the EPA's rule would \"make it impossible to build a new coal-powered plant in American... That is hard to believe that that will can be the situation in our great country, particularly since 40 percent of our electricity comes from coal.\" Whitfield argued that the legislation was needed because the EPA refused to respond to criticism or complaints about their proposed rule. Republicans also criticized the EPA's proposed rule, suggesting that it could raise electricity prices by up to $1,200 per household.\n\nThe activist group FreedomWorks supported the bill and asked its members to contact their representatives about it. In a blog post FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe said that the bill would go a \"long way in curbing the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) radical war on affordable and reliable energy from fossil fuels.\" Kibbe argued that the EPA's proposed rule was \"an obvious backdoor attempt to effectively outlaw coal\" becaust the standards were set \"well below the emissions levels achieved by even the most advanced coal facilities.\"\n\nThe bill was also supported by Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform. Norquist said \"Congress never intended for the EPA to unilaterally determine what source of energy Americans consume. The Electricity Security and Affordability Act also reaffirms Congress's legislative duties by enacting numerous safeguards against EPA partisan overreach.\"\n\nMost Democrats opposed the bill, arguing that it was meant to derail efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) said that \"If we pass this terrible bill, we will vote to let China leap ahead of us in the race to build the clean energy economy for the future, and we will be ignoring our moral obligation to protect the planet for our children and grandchildren.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama said that he would veto the bill. Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) did not believe that the bill would pass the Senate, so \"we are wasting the time of the American people.\"\n\n\n"}

This festival occurs once every 144 years, corresponding to the 12th recurrence of the 12-year Godavari Pushkaram cycle.\n\nThe festival starts from the Ashadha (June/July) month on the Chaturdashi day (thithi) (14th day), when planet Jupiter enters the zodiac sign of Leo. The festival is \"theoretically\" observed throughout the twelve months that the planet remains in that sign, but the first 12 days are considered most sacred. The first 12 days of the Godavari Pushkaram are known as \"Aadhi Pushkaram\" and the last 12 days are titled \"Anthya Pushkaralu\". The next Maha Pushkaram will be celebrated in 2159.\n\nAt least 27 pilgrims, 13 of them women, died and 20 others injured in a stampede at a major bathing spot on the banks of the Godavari river where a huge crowd of devotees had gathered on the opening day of 'Pushkaram' festival.\n\n\"Maha\" means \"great\" and Pushkaram refers to the worship of the river in which the god Pushkar appears every 12 years. Pushakaram is spelled Pushkaralu in Telugu, Pushkaram in Tamil, Pushkara in Kannada, and Pushkar in Hindi.\n\nPushkaram is an Indian festival dedicated to worshiping of 12 sacred rivers. The celebration happens annually, once in 12 years along each river. Each river is associated with a zodiac sign, and the river for each year's festival is based on which sign Bruhaspathi (Jupiter) is in at the time. It is believed that bathing in the sacred river during Pushkaram cleanses the devotees of their sins.\n\nGodavari is one of the 12 sacred rivers, and the \"Godavari Pushkaram\" takes place once every 12 years, when the Jupiter is in the Leo sign. The \"Maha Pushkaram\" (\"Great Pushkaram\") takes place once every 144 years.\n\nThe 2015 Godavari Pushkaram is believed to be a \"Maha Pushkaram\", which happens once in 144 years. During the year 2015, Jupiter enters Leo on 14 July 2015 (Tuesday) at 6.26 AM, when the Maha Pushkaram begins, and ends after 12 days on 25 July 2015 (Saturday).\n\nMultiple almanac writers and other skeptics have disputed that the 2015 Godavari Pushkaram is a \"Maha Pushkaram\". According to Hanmanthavajjula Subrahmanya Sarma, the president of State Drukghanitha Almanac Writers’ Association, the \"theory of 144 years is a myth\", and nobody knows \"who calculated it and how they calculated it\".\n\nThe places on the banks of the Godavari River where pilgrims visit famous temples are in the five districts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The notable places are Manthani, Basar, Dharmapuri, Koti Lingala, Kaleshwaram, Bhadrachalam in Telangana and Rajahmundry, Kovvur, Narasapuram, Antervedi in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThe Maha Pushkaram festival in 2015 attracted 48.1 million people in Andhra Pradesh and 57 million people in the Telangana state link from all parts of India. On this occasion, it is essential to take a holy dip in the Godavari River to get the supposed benefits of better physical and mental abilities. The Governments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have made all arrangements for this event in their respective states by constructing ghats for bathing and improving road communications, basic amenities of water supply and sanitation, and security. In Andhra Pradesh. the budget allocated for improvement of infrastructure facilities is INR 1,295 crores.\n\nAn emblem titled \"Godavari Maha Pushkaram 2015\" and \"Godavari Pushkaramalu\" has been adopted by the state governments for this festival, and a special organization under the same name has also been instituted to address all issues related to the smooth functioning of the festive event. The emblem or logo with a simple design has lines to denote the rapid flow conditions of the Godavari River, a \"jyoti\" a glowing light, and the representation of offering oblation, called \"Arghyam\", to Surya, the Sun god.\n\nAnother symbolic event proposed during the festival is to hold \"Sobha Yatra\", a procession carrying the sacred waters of the Godavari River to be mixed with water bodies in all the villages in the 13 districts which lie within the ambit of the Godavari River.\n\nA religious symbolic performance called the \"Godavari Harathi\", a ritual of worship with a number of lamps, similar to the Ganga Aarti that is conducted on the banks of the Ganges in Varanasi, is also proposed to be held at Rajahmundry where the river flows out to the sea.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

HRV systems provide ventilation without the loss of heat or humidity, which could put stress on a building's heating, ventilating/ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. HRV introduces fresh air to a building and improves climate control, whilst promoting efficient energy use.\n\nUK building regulations require one air change every two hours (0.5 ACH). With traditional extract-only ventilation that means a house boiler would need to warm up a house-full of cold air 12 times a day.\n\nHRVs and ERVs can be stand-alone devices that operate independently, or they can be built-in or added to existing HVAC systems. For a small building in which nearly every room has an exterior wall, then the HRV/ERV device can be small and provide ventilation for a single room. A larger building would require either many small units or a large central unit. The only requirements for the building are an air supply, either directly from an exterior wall or ducted to one, and an energy supply for air circulation, such as wind energy or electricity for fans and electronic control system. When used with 'central' HVAC systems, then the system would be of the 'forced-air' type.\n\nThere are a number of types of air-to-air heat exchanger that can be used in HRV devices:\n\n\nThe air coming into the heat exchanger should be above 0 °C. Otherwise humidity in the outgoing air may condense, freeze and block the heat exchanger.\n\nA high enough incoming air temperature can also be achieved by\n\nThis can be done by an earth warming pipe (\"ground-coupled heat exchanger\"), usually about 30 m to 40 m long and 20 cm in diameter, typically buried about 1.5 m below ground level. In Germany and Austria this is a common configuration for earth-to-air heat exchangers.\n\nIn high humidity areas where internal condensation could lead to fungal/mould growth in the tube leading to contamination of the air, several measures exist to prevent this.\n\n\nThe pipes may be either corrugated/slotted to enhance heat transfer and provide condensate drainage or smooth/solid to prevent gas/liquid transfer.\n\nThis is highly site dependent.\n\nOne critical problem of using earth-to-air heat exchanger is being located in soils with underlying rock strata which emit radon. In these situations the tube needs to be airtight from the surrounding soils, or an air to water heat exchanger needs to be used.\n\nFormal research indicates that Earth-to-Air Heat Exchangers (EAHX) reduce building ventilation air pollution. Rabindra (2004) states, “The Earth-Air Tunnel is found not to support the growth of bacteria and fungi; rather it is found to reduce the quantity of bacteria and fungi thus making the air safer for humans to inhale. It is therefore clear that the use of earth-to-air heat exchangers not only helps save the energy but also helps reduce the air pollution by reducing bacteria and fungi.”\n\nLikewise, Flueckiger (1999) in a study of twelve Earth-to-Air Heat Exchangers varying in design, pipe material, size and age, stated, “This study was performed because of concerns of potential microbial growth in the buried pipes of 'ground-coupled' air systems. The results, however, demonstrate that no harmful growth occurs and that the airborne concentrations of viable spores and bacteria, with few exceptions, even decreases after passage through the pipe-system”, and further stated, “Based on these investigations the operation of ground-coupled earth-to-air heat exchangers is acceptable as long as regular controls are undertaken and if appropriate cleaning facilities are available”.\n\nAn alternative to the earth-to-air heat exchanger is the earth-to-water heat exchanger. This is typically similar to a geothermal heat pump tubing embedded horizontally in the soil (or could be a vertical pipe/sonde) to a similar depth of the EAHX. It uses approximately double the length of pipe Ø 35 mm i.e. around 80 metres compared to an EAHX. A heat exchanger coil is placed before the air inlet of the HRV. Typically a brine liquid (heavily salted water) is used as the heat exchange fluid which is slightly more efficient and environmentally friendly than polypropylene heat transfer liquids.\n\nIn temperate climates in an energy efficient building, such as a passivhaus, this is more than sufficient for comfort cooling during summer without resorting to an airconditioning system. In more extreme hot climates a very small air-to-air micro-heat pump in reverse (an air conditioner) with the evaporator (giving heat) on the air inlet after the HRV heat exchanger and the condenser (taking heat) from the air outlet after the heat exchanger will suffice.\n\nAt certain times of the year, it is more thermally efficient to bypass the Heat recovery ventilation-HRV heat exchanger or the earth-to-air heat exchanger (EAHX).\n\nFor example, during the winter, the earth at the depth of the earth-to-air heat exchanger is ordinarily much warmer than the air temperature. The air becomes warmed by the earth before reaching the air heat exchanger.\n\nIn the summer, the opposite is true. The air becomes cooled in the earth to air exchanger. But after passing through the EAHX, the air is warmed by the heat recovery ventilator using the warmth of the outgoing air. In this case, the HRV can have an internal bypass such that the inflowing air bypasses the heat exchanger maximising the cooling potential of the earth.\n\nIn autumn and spring there may be no thermal benefit from the EAHX—it may heat/cool the air too much and it will be better to use external air directly. In this case it is helpful to have a bypass such that the EAHX is disconnected and air taken directly from outside. A differential temperature sensor with a motorized valve can control the bypass function.\n\n"}
{"id": "7401066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7401066", "title": "HiPER", "text": "HiPER\n\nThe High Power laser Energy Research facility (HiPER), is a proposed experimental laser-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF) device undergoing preliminary design for possible construction in the European Union. HiPER is the first experiment designed specifically to study the \"fast ignition\" approach to generating nuclear fusion, which uses much smaller lasers than conventional designs, yet produces fusion power outputs of about the same magnitude. This offers a total \"fusion gain\" that is much higher than devices like the National Ignition Facility (NIF), and a reduction in construction costs of about ten times.\n\nTheoretical research since the design of HiPER in the early 2000s has cast doubt on fast ignition as a route to practical ICF. A new approach known as \"shock ignition\" has been proposed to address some of these problems. A similar ICF experimental setup in Japan was known as \"HIPER\", but this is no longer operational.\n\nInertial confinement fusion (ICF) devices use \"drivers\" to rapidly heat the outer layers of a \"target\" to compress it. The target is a small spherical pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of deuterium and tritium. The heat of the laser burns the surface of the pellet into a plasma, which explodes off the surface. The remaining portion of the target is driven inwards due to Newton's Third Law, eventually collapsing into a small point of very high density. The rapid blowoff also creates a shock wave that travels towards the center of the compressed fuel. When it reaches the center of the fuel and meets the shock from the other side of the target, the energy in the shock wave further heats and compresses the tiny volume around it. If the temperature and density of that small spot can be raised high enough, fusion reactions will occur.\n\nThe fusion reactions release high-energy particles, some of which (primarily alpha particles) collide with the high density fuel around it and slow down. This heats the fuel further, and can potentially cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well. Given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuel—high enough density and temperature—this heating process can result in a chain reaction, burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction. This is a condition known as \"ignition\", which can lead to a significant portion of the fuel in the target undergoing fusion, and the release of significant amounts of energy.\n\nTo date most ICF experiments have used lasers to heat the targets. Calculations show that the energy must be delivered quickly to compress the core before it disassembles, as well as creating a suitable shock wave. The energy must also be focused extremely evenly across the target's outer surface to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core. Although other \"drivers\" have been suggested, notably heavy ions driven in particle accelerators, lasers are currently the only devices with the right combination of features.\n\nIn the case of HiPER, the driver laser system is similar to existing systems like NIF, but considerably smaller and less powerful.\n\nThe driver consists of a number of \"beamlines\" containing amplifiers at one end of the building. Just prior to firing, the glass is \"pumped\" to a high-energy state with a series of xenon flash tubes, causing a population inversion of the neodymium (Nd) atoms in the glass. This readies them for amplification via stimulated emission when a small amount of laser light, generated externally in a fibre optic, is fed into the beamlines. The glass is not particularly effective at transferring power into the beam, so to get as much power as possible back out the beam is reflected through the glass four times in a mirrored cavity, each time gaining more power. When this process is complete, a Pockels cell \"switches\" the light out of the cavity. One problem for the HiPER project is that Nd:glass is no longer being produced commercially, so a number of options need to be studied to ensure supply of the estimated 1,300 disks.\n\nFrom there, the laser light is fed into a very long spatial filter to clean up the resulting pulse. The filter is essentially a telescope that focuses the beam into a spot some distance away, where a small pinhole located at the focal point cuts off any \"stray\" light caused by inhomogeneities in the laser beam. The beam then widens out until a second lens returns it to a straight beam again. It is the use of spatial filters that lead to the long beamlines seen in ICF laser devices. In the case of HiPER, the filters take up about 50% of the overall length. The beam width at exit of the driver system is about 40 cm × 40 cm.\n\nOne of the problems encountered in previous experiments, notably the Shiva laser, was that the infrared light provided by the Nd:glass lasers (at ~1054 nm in \"vaco\") couples strongly with the electrons around the target, losing a considerable amount of energy that would otherwise heat the target itself. This is typically addressed through the use of an optical frequency multiplier, which can double or triple the frequency of the light, into the green or ultraviolet, respectively. These higher frequencies interact less strongly with the electrons, putting more power into the target. HiPER will use frequency tripling on the drivers.\n\nWhen the amplification process is complete the laser light enters the experimental chamber, lying at one end of the building. Here it is reflected off a series of deformable mirrors that help correct remaining imperfections in the wavefront, and then feeds them into the target chamber from all angles. Since the overall distances from the ends of the beamlines to different points on the target chamber are different, delays are introduced on the individual paths to ensure they all reach the center of the chamber at the same time, within about 10 picoseconds (ps). The target, a fusion fuel pellet about 1 mm in diameter in the case of HiPER, lies at the center of the chamber.\n\nHiPER differs from most ICF devices in that it also includes a second set of lasers for directly heating the compressed fuel. The heating pulse needs to be very short, about 10 to 20 ps long, but this is too short a time for the amplifiers to work well. To solve this problem HiPER uses a technique known as \"chirped pulse amplification\" (CPA). CPA starts with a short pulse from a wide-bandwidth (multi-frequency) laser source, as opposed to the driver which uses a monochromatic (single-frequency) source. Light from this initial pulse is split into different colours using a pair of diffraction gratings and optical delays. This \"stretches\" the pulse into a chain several nanoseconds long. The pulse is then sent into the amplifiers as normal. When it exits the beamlines it is recombined in a similar set of gratings to produce a single very short pulse, but because the pulse now has very high power, the gratings have to be large (approx 1 m) and sit in a vacuum. Additionally the individual beams must be lower in power overall; the compression side of the system uses 40 beamlines of about 5 kJ each to generate a total of 200 kJ, whereas the ignition side requires 24 beamlines of just under 3 kJ to generate a total of 70 kJ. The precise number and power of the beamlines are currently a subject of research. Frequency multiplication will also be used on the heaters, but it has not yet been decided whether to use doubling or tripling; the latter puts more power into the target, but is less efficient converting the light. As of 2007, the baseline design is based on doubling into the green.\n\nIn traditional ICF devices the driver laser is used to compress the target to very high densities. The shock wave created by this process further heats the compressed fuel when it collides in the center of the sphere. If the compression is symmetrical enough the increase in temperature can create conditions close to the Lawson criterion, leading to significant fusion energy production. If the resulting fusion rate is high enough, the energy released in these reactions will heat the surrounding fuel to similar temperatures, causing them to undergo fusion as well. In this case, known as \"ignition\", a significant portion of the fuel will undergo fusion and release large amounts of energy. Ignition is the basic goal of any fusion device.\n\nThe amount of laser energy needed to effectively compress the targets to ignition conditions has grown rapidly from early estimates. In the \"early days\" of ICF research in the 1970s it was believed that as little as 1 kilojoules (kJ) would suffice, and a number of experimental lasers were built to reach these power levels. When they did, a series of problems, typically related to the homogeneity of the collapse, turned out to seriously disrupt the implosion symmetry and lead to much cooler core temperatures than originally expected. Through the 1980s the estimated energy required to reach ignition grew into the megajoule range, which appeared to make ICF impractical for fusion energy production. For instance, the National Ignition Facility (NIF) uses about 330 MJ of electrical power to pump the driver lasers, and in the best case is expected to produce about 20 MJ of fusion power output. Without dramatic gains in output, such a device would never be a practical energy source.\n\nThe fast ignition approach attempts to avoid these problems. Instead of using the shock wave to create the conditions needed for fusion above the ignition range, this approach directly heats the fuel. This is far more efficient than the shock wave, which becomes less important. In HiPER, the compression provided by the driver is \"good\", but not nearly that created by larger devices like NIF; HiPER's driver is about 200 kJ and produces densities of about 300 g/cm. That's about one-third that of NIF, and about the same as generated by the earlier NOVA laser of the 1980s. For comparison, lead is about 11 g/cm, so this still represents a considerable amount of compression, notably when one considers the target's interior contained light D-T fuel around 0.1 g/cm.\n\nIgnition is started by a very-short (~10 picoseconds) ultra-high-power (~70 kJ, 4 PW) laser pulse, aimed through a hole in the plasma at the core. The light from this pulse interacts with the fuel, generating a shower of high-energy (3.5 MeV) relativistic electrons that are driven into the fuel. The electrons heat a spot on one side of the dense core, and if this heating is localised enough it is expected to drive the area well beyond ignition energies.\n\nThe overall efficiency of this approach is many times that of the conventional approach. In the case of NIF the laser generates about 4 MJ of infrared power to create ignition that releases about 20 MJ of energy. This corresponds to a \"fusion gain\" —the ratio of input laser power to output fusion power— of about 5. If one uses the baseline assumptions for the current HiPER design, the two lasers (driver and heater) produce about 270 kJ in total, yet generate 25 to 30 MJ, a gain of about 100. Considering a variety of losses, the actual gain is predicted to be around 72. Not only does this outperform NIF by a wide margin, the smaller lasers are much less expensive to build as well. In terms of power-for-cost, HiPER is expected to be about an order of magnitude less expensive than conventional devices like NIF.\n\nCompression is already a fairly well-understood problem, and HiPER is primarily interested in exploring the precise physics of the rapid heating process. It is not clear how quickly the electrons stop in the fuel load; while this is known for matter under normal pressures, it's not for the ultra-dense conditions of the compressed fuel. To work efficiently, the electrons should stop in as short a distance as possible, to release their energy into a small spot and thus raise the temperature (energy per unit volume) as high as possible.\n\nHow to get the laser light onto that spot is also a matter for further research. One approach uses a short pulse from another laser to heat the plasma outside the dense \"core\", essentially burning a hole through it and exposing the dense fuel inside. This approach will be tested on the OMEGA-EP system in the US. Another approach, tested successfully on the GEKKO XII laser in Japan, uses a small gold cone that cuts through a small area of the target shell; on heating no plasma is created in this area, leaving a hole that can be aimed into by shining the laser into the inner surface of the cone. HiPER is currently planning on using the gold cone approach, but will likely study the burning solution as well.\n\nIn 2005 HiPER completed a preliminary study outlining possible approaches and arguments for its construction. The report received positive reviews from the EC in July 2007, and moved onto a preparatory design phase in early 2008 with detailed designs for construction beginning in 2011 or 2012.\n\nIn parallel, the HiPER project also proposes to build smaller laser systems with higher repetition rates. The high-powered flash lamps used to pump the laser amplifier glass causes it to deform, and it cannot be fired again until it cools off, which takes as long as a day. Additionally only a very small amount of the flash of white light generated by the tubes is of the right frequency to be absorbed by the Nd:glass and thus lead to amplification, in general only about 1 to 1.5% of the energy fed into the tubes ends up in the laser beam.\n\nKey to avoiding these problems is replacing the flash lamps with more efficient pumps, typically based on laser diodes. These are far more efficient at generating light from electricity, and thus run much cooler. More importantly, the light they do generate is fairly monochromatic and can be tuned to frequencies that can be easily absorbed. This means that much less power needs to be used to produce any particular amount of laser light, further reducing the overall amount of heat being generated. The improvement in efficiency can be dramatic; existing experimental devices operate at about 10% overall efficiency, and it is believed \"near term\" devices will improve this as high as 20%.\n\nHiPER proposes to build a demonstrator diode-pump system producing 10 kJ at 1 Hz or 1 kJ at 10 Hz depending on a design choice yet to be made. The best high-repetition lasers currently operating are much smaller; Mercury at Livermore is about 70 J, HALNA in Japan at ~20 J, and LUCIA in France at ~100 J. HiPER's demonstrator would thus be between 10 and 500 times as powerful as any of these.\n\nTo make a practical commercial power generator, the high-gain of a device like HiPER would have to be combined with a high-repetition rate laser and a target chamber capable of extracting the power. Additional areas of research for post-HiPER devices include practical methods to carry the heat out of the target chamber for power production, protecting the device from the neutron flux generated by the fusion reactions, and the production of tritium from this flux to produce more fuel for the reactor.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3864143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3864143", "title": "Igneous differentiation", "text": "Igneous differentiation\n\nIn geology, igneous differentiation, or magmatic differentiation, is an umbrella term for the various processes by which magmas undergo bulk chemical change during the partial melting process, cooling, emplacement, or eruption.\n\nWhen a rock melts to form a liquid, the liquid is known as a \"primary melt\". Primary melts have not undergone any differentiation and represent the starting composition of a magma. In nature, primary melts are rarely seen. Some leucosomes of migmatites are examples of primary melts. Primary melts derived from the mantle are especially important and are known as \"primitive melts\" or primitive magmas. By finding the primitive magma composition of a magma series, it is possible to model the composition of the rock from which a melt was formed, which is important because we have little direct evidence of the Earth's mantle.\n\nWhere it is impossible to find the primitive or primary magma composition, it is often useful to attempt to identify a parental melt. A parental melt is a magma composition from which the observed range of magma chemistries has been derived by the processes of igneous differentiation. It need not be a primitive melt.\n\nFor instance, a series of basalt lava flows is assumed to be related to one another. A composition from which they could reasonably be produced by fractional crystallization is termed a \"parental melt\". To prove this, fractional crystallization models would be produced to test the hypothesis that they share a common parental melt.\n\nFractional crystallization and accumulation of crystals formed during the differentiation process of a magmatic event are known as \"cumulate rocks\", and those parts are the first which crystallize out of the magma. Identifying whether a rock is a cumulate or not is crucial for understanding if it can be modelled back to a primary melt or a primitive melt, and identifying whether the magma has dropped out cumulate minerals is equally important even for rocks which carry no phenocrysts.\n\nThe primary cause of change in the composition of a magma is \"cooling\", which is an inevitable consequence of the magma being created and migrating from the site of partial melting into an area of lower stress - generally a cooler volume of the crust.\n\nCooling causes the magma to begin to crystallize minerals from the melt or liquid portion of the magma. Most magmas are a mixture of liquid rock (melt) and minerals (phenocrysts).\n\nContamination is another cause of magma differentiation. Contamination can be caused by \"assimilation\" of wall rocks, mixing of two or more magmas or even by replenishment of the magma chamber with fresh, hot magma.\n\nThe whole gamut of mechanisms for differentiation has been referred to as the FARM process, which stands for Fractional crystallization, Assimilation, Replenishment and Magma mixing.\n\nFractional crystallization is the removal and segregation from a melt of mineral precipitates, which changes the composition of the melt. This is one of the most important geochemical and physical processes operating within the Earth's crust and mantle.\n\nFractional crystallization in silicate melts (magmas) is a very complex process compared to chemical systems in the laboratory because it is affected by a wide variety of phenomena. Prime amongst these are the composition, temperature, and pressure of a magma during its cooling.\n\nThe composition of a magma is the primary control on which mineral is crystallized as the melt cools down past the liquidus. For instance in mafic and ultramafic melts, the MgO and SiO contents determine whether forsterite olivine is precipitated or whether enstatite pyroxene is precipitated.\n\nTwo magmas of similar composition and temperature at different pressure may crystallize different minerals. An example is high-pressure and high-temperature fractional crystallization of granites to produce single-feldspar granite, and low-pressure low-temperature conditions which produce two-feldspar granites.\n\nThe partial pressure of volatile phases in silicate melts is also of prime importance, especially in near-solidus crystallization of granites.\n\nAssimilation is a popular mechanism for explaining the felsification of ultramafic and mafic magmas as they rise through the crust. Assimilation assumes that a hot primitive melt intruding into a cooler, felsic crust will melt the crust and mix with the resulting melt. This then alters the composition of the primitive magma.\n\nEffects of this kind are to be expected, and have been clearly proven in many places. There is, however, a general reluctance to admit that they are of great importance. The nature and succession of the rock types do not as a rule show any relation to the sedimentary or other materials which may be supposed to have been dissolved; and where solution is known to have gone on the products are usually of abnormal character and easily distinguishable from the common rock types.\n\nWhen a melt undergoes cooling along the liquid line of descent, the results are limited to the production of a homogeneous solid body of intrusive rock, with uniform mineralogy and composition, or a partially differentiated cumulate mass with layers, compositional zones and so on. This behaviour is fairly predictable and easy enough to prove with geochemical investigations. In such cases, a magma chamber will form a close approximation of the ideal Bowen's reaction series. However, most magmatic systems are polyphase events, with several pulses of magmatism. In such a case, the liquid line of descent is interrupted by the injection of a fresh batch of hot, undifferentiated magma. This can cause extreme fractional crystallisation because of three main effects:\n\n\nMagma mixing is the process by which two magmas meet, comingle, and form a magma of a composition somewhere between the two end-member magmas.\n\nMagma mixing is a common process in volcanic magma chambers, which are open-system chambers where magmas enter the chamber, undergo some form of assimilation, fractional crystallisation and partial melt extraction (via eruption of lava), and are replenished.\n\nMagma mixing also tends to occur at deeper levels in the crust and is considered one of the primary mechanisms for forming intermediate rocks such as monzonite and andesite. Here, due to heat transfer and increased volatile flux from subduction, the silicic crust melts to form a felsic magma (essentially granitic in composition). These granitic melts are known as an \"underplate\". Basaltic primary melts formed in the mantle beneath the crust rise and mingle with the underplate magmas, the result being part-way between basalt and rhyolite; literally an 'intermediate' composition.\n\nInterface entrapment\nConvection in a large magma chamber is subject to the interplay of forces generated by thermal convection and the resistance offered by friction, viscosity and drag on the magma offered by the walls of the magma chamber. Often near the margins of a magma chamber which is convecting, cooler and more viscous layers form concentrically from the outside in, defined by breaks in viscosity and temperature. This forms laminar flow, which separates several domains of the magma chamber which can begin to differentiate separately.\n\nFlow banding is the result of a process of fractional crystallization which occurs by convection, if the crystals which are caught in the flow-banded margins are removed from the melt. The friction and viscosity of the magma causes phenocrysts and xenoliths within the magma or lava to slow down near the interface and become trapped in a viscous layer. This can change the composition of the melt in large intrusions, leading to differentiation.\n\nPartial melt extraction<br>\nWith reference to the definitions, above, a magma chamber will tend to cool down and crystallize minerals according to the liquid line of descent. When this occurs, especially in conjunction with zonation and crystal accumulation, and the melt portion is removed, this can change the composition of a magma chamber. In fact, this is basically fractional crystallization, except in this case we are observing a magma chamber which is the remnant left behind from which a daughter melt has been extracted.\n\nIf such a magma chamber continues to cool, the minerals it forms and its overall composition will not match a sample liquid line of descent or a parental magma composition.\n\nIt is worth reiterating that magma chambers are not usually static single entities. The typical magma chamber is formed from a series of injections of melt and magma, and most are also subject to some form of partial melt extraction.\n\nGranite magmas are generally much more viscous than mafic magmas and are usually more homogeneous in composition. This is generally considered to be caused by the viscosity of the magma, which is orders of magnitude higher than mafic magmas. The higher viscosity means that, when melted, a granitic magma will tend to move in a larger concerted mass and be emplaced as a larger mass because it is less fluid and able to move. This is why granites tend to occur as large plutons, and mafic rocks as dikes and sills.\n\nGranites are cooler and are therefore less able to melt and assimilate country rocks. Wholesale contamination is therefore minor and unusual, although mixing of granitic and basaltic melts is not unknown where basalt is injected into granitic magma chambers.\n\nMafic magmas are more liable to flow, and are therefore more likely to undergo periodic replenishment of a magma chamber. Because they are more fluid, crystal precipitation occurs much more rapidly, resulting in greater changes by fractional crystallisation. Higher temperatures also allow mafic magmas to assimilate wall rocks more readily and therefore contamination is more common and better developed.\n\nAll igneous magmas contain dissolved gases (water, carbonic acid, hydrogen sulfide, chlorine, fluorine, boric acid, etc.).\nOf these water is the principal, and was formerly believed to have percolated downwards from the Earth's surface to the heated rocks below, but is now generally admitted to be an integral part of the magma. Many peculiarities of the structure of the plutonic rocks as contrasted with the lavas may reasonably be accounted for by the operation of these gases, which were unable to escape as the deep-seated masses slowly cooled, while they were promptly given up by the superficial effusions. The acid plutonic or intrusive rocks have never been reproduced by laboratory experiments, and the only successful attempts to obtain their minerals artificially have been those in which special provision was made for the retention of the \"mineralizing\" gases in the crucibles or sealed tubes employed. These gases often do not enter into the composition of the rock-forming minerals, for most of these are free from water, carbonic acid, etc. Hence as crystallization goes on the residual melt must contain an ever-increasing proportion of volatile constituents. It is conceivable that in the final stages the still uncrystallized part of the magma has more resemblance to a solution of mineral matter in superheated steam than to a dry igneous fusion. Quartz, for example, is the last mineral to form in a granite. It bears much of the stamp of the quartz which we know has been deposited from aqueous solution in veins, etc. It is at the same time the most infusible of all the common minerals of rocks. Its late formation shows that in this case it arose at comparatively low temperatures and points clearly to the special importance of the gases of the magma as determining the sequence of crystallization.\n\nWhen solidification is nearly complete the gases can no longer be retained in the rock and make their escape through fissures towards the surface. They are powerful agents in attacking the minerals of the rocks which they traverse, and instances of their operation are found in the kaolinization of granites, tourmalinization and formation of greisen, deposition of quartz veins, and the group of changes known as propylitization. These \"pneumatolytic\" processes are of the first importance in the genesis of many ore deposits. They are a real part of the history of the magma itself and constitute the terminal phases of the volcanic sequence.\n\nThere are several methods of directly measuring and quantifying igneous differentiation processes;\n\nIn all cases, the primary and most valuable method for identifying magma differentiation processes is mapping the exposed rocks, tracking mineralogical changes within the igneous rocks and describing field relationships and textural evidence for magma differentiation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "663355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=663355", "title": "Lava tube", "text": "Lava tube\n\nA lava tube is a natural conduit formed by flowing lava which moves beneath the hardened surface of a lava flow. Tubes can drain lava from a volcano during an eruption, or can be extinct, meaning the lava flow has ceased, and the rock has cooled and left a long cave.\n\nA lava tube is a type of lava cave formed when a low-viscosity lava flow develops a continuous and hard crust, which thickens and forms a roof above the still-flowing lava stream. Tubes form in one of two ways: either by the crusting over of lava channels, or from pāhoehoe flows where the lava is moving under the surface.\n\nLava usually leaves the point of eruption in channels. These channels tend to stay very hot as their surroundings cool. This means they slowly develop walls around them as the surrounding lava cools and/or as the channel melts its way deeper. These channels can get deep enough to crust over, forming an insulating tube that keeps the lava molten and serves as a conduit for the flowing lava. These types of lava tubes tend to be closer to the lava eruption point.\n\nFarther away from the eruption point, lava can flow in an unchanneled, fan-like manner as it leaves its source, which is usually another lava tube leading back to the eruption point. Called pāhoehoe flows, these areas of surface-moving lava cool, forming either a smooth or rough, ropy surface. The lava continues to flow this way until it begins to block its source. At this point, the subsurface lava is still hot enough to break out at a point, and from this point the lava begins as a new \"source\". Lava flows from the previous source to this breakout point as the surrounding lava of the pāhoehoe flow cools. This forms an underground channel that becomes a lava tube.\n\nA broad lava-flow field often consists of a main lava tube and a series of smaller tubes that supply lava to the front of one or more separate flows. When the supply of lava stops at the end of an eruption or lava is diverted elsewhere, lava in the tube system drains downslope and leaves partially empty caves.\n\nSuch drained tubes commonly exhibit step marks on their walls that mark the various depths at which the lava flowed, known as flow ledges or flow lines depending on how prominently they protrude from the walls. Lava tubes generally have pāhoehoe floors, although this may often be covered in breakdown from the ceiling. A variety of speleothems may be found in lava tubes including a variety of stalactite forms generally known as lavacicles, which can be of the splash, shark tooth, or tubular variety. Lavacicles are the most common of lava tube speleothems. Drip stalagmites may form under tubular lava stalactites, and the latter may grade into a form known as a tubular lava helictite. A runner is a bead of lava that is extruded from a small opening and then runs down a wall. Lava tubes may also contain mineral deposits that most commonly take the form of crusts or small crystals, and less commonly, as stalactites and stalagmites. \n\nLava tubes can be up to wide, though are often narrower, and run anywhere from below the surface. Lava tubes can also be extremely long; one tube from the Mauna Loa 1859 flow enters the ocean about from its eruption point, and the Cueva del Viento–Sobrado system on Teide, Tenerife island, is over long, due to extensive braided maze areas at the upper zones of the system.\n\nA lava tube system in Kiama, Australia, consists of over 20 tubes, many of which are breakouts of a main lava tube. The largest of these lava tubes is in diameter and has columnar jointing due to the large cooling surface. Other tubes have concentric and radial jointing features. The tubes are infilled due to the low slope angle of emplacement.\n\nBy far the largest known lava tubes in the Solar System are on Venus.\n\nLunar lava tubes have been discovered and have been studied as possible human habitats, providing natural shielding from radiation.\n\nMartian lava tubes are associated with innumerable lava flows and lava channels on the flanks of Olympus Mons. Partially collapsed lava tubes are visible as chains of pit craters, and broad lava fans formed by lava emerging from intact, subsurface tubes are also common.\n\n\n"}

The highest rainfall totals in the country have been measured across the Gulf Coast and lower portions of the Eastern Seaboard. Intermediate amounts have been measured across the Southwest, New England, and the Midwest. The northern Great Plains and Pacific Northwest have received the lowest amounts, as those regions lie exceptionally far from the breeding grounds of Atlantic and Eastern Pacific tropical cyclones.\n\nA measurement of of rain during Hurricane Harvey, in Southeast Texas, holds the record for the highest precipitation total observed with a tropical cyclone in the United States. Tropical Storm Claudette holds the national 24-hour rainfall record, recorded in Alvin, Texas with observed within such a timeframe. Taking place only one year apart, in 1978 and 1979, tropical storms Amelia and Claudette are also among the wettest tropical cyclones on record in the United States and they both have occurred in Texas. Hurricanes Hiki and Lane both dumped significant rainfall in the mountains of Hawaii, each with approximately of rainfall reported.\n\nBelow is a list of the top ten highest storm total rainfall amounts from individual tropical cyclones across the United States since 1950, including territories.\nBelow is a list of the top ten highest storm total rainfall amounts from individual tropical cyclones across the contiguous United States since 1950. The remains of Amelia 1978 led to the wettest storm total rainfall amounts of any tropical cyclone to impact the lower 48 over that time frame when it moved into Texas during early August 1978. It would not be surpassed until Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which dropped a maximum of 60.58 inches (1538.7 mm), making it the wettest tropical cyclone in the United States.\n\nThe wettest tropical cyclone to impact the state of Alabama was Hurricane Danny, which stalled over Mobile Bay for over 24 hours, and which led to significant rainfall.\n\nNo tropical cyclone has ever affected Alaska, but extratropical remnants of tropical cyclones have been known to bring heavy rainfall to the state. Examples include the extratropical remnants of Hurricane Fico in 1978.\n\nTropical cyclones impact the island chain with tropical storm-force winds once every three years, on average. The wettest known cyclone to affect the island group occurred early in 1966, when nearly fell at Vaipito.\n\nHurricane Nora was the last tropical cyclone to enter the United States from Mexico at tropical storm strength. The rainfall which fell across the Harquahala Mountains led to the state's 24-hour rainfall record.\n\nTropical Storm Allison in 1989 stalled for three days across southeast Texas which led to prolonged rains across Arkansas. This way, Allison became the wettest known tropical cyclone to impact the state.\n\nOne of five known eastern Pacific tropical cyclones to bring tropical storm-force winds to the Southwest, Hurricane Kathleen accelerated northward ahead of an upper level trough, spreading heavy rains into the transverse ranges of southern California.\n\nFew tropical cyclone remnants originating from the eastern Pacific make it as far north as Colorado. Javier dropped locally heavy rainfall exceeding over the higher terrain of western Colorado in 2004.\n\nWhile Hurricane Diane is wettest known tropical cyclone to impact New England, the 1938 New England hurricane produced the most rain in the state of Connecticut. Nonetheless, the flood from Hurricane Diane led to a significant death toll (nearly 200) from Pennsylvania eastward through southern New England.\n\nA large swath of heavy rainfall spread associated with a predecessor rainfall event fell before 1933 Chesapeake–Potomac hurricane arrived in Delaware. Over four days, a total of of rain fell in Bridgeville, the most known associated with a tropical cyclone anywhere in Delaware.\n\nThe heaviest rainfall to occur in 24 hours was measured in Yankeetown during Hurricane Easy in 1950, which caused of precipitation. This is also the highest known point storm total maximum related to any tropical cyclone which has impacted Florida, and by itself would be the highest known rainfall total for any month, or any 24 hour period, from any location within Florida. This rainfall amount remained the national 24-hour rainfall record until Tropical Storm Claudette's landfall in 1979.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto in 1994 looped across central Georgia, leading to 24-hour rainfall amounts exceeding across central sections of the state. It also became the wettest tropical cyclone on record for the state of Georgia, eclipsing the record set in 1929.\n\nSuper Typhoon Pamela was not only a wet tropical cyclone for the island of Guam, but a destructive one as well. Since Pamela, wooden structures across Guam have been largely replaced by concrete structures in order to better weather typhoons.\n\nThis island state frequently sees rainfall from the remains of former eastern and central Pacific tropical cyclones. However, despite Hawaii's location in the subtropics, direct impacts by tropical cyclones are infrequent due to the protective influence of the Central Pacific Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT), which normally dissipates systems approaching Hawaii. Hurricane Hiki in 1950 led to significant rainfall in the mountains, with of rainfall reported. This was the most rainfall reported to have been produced by a tropical cyclone within the United States until surpassed by Hurricane Harvey in 2017.\n\nImpacts from tropical cyclones in the Pacific Northwest are rare. Most recently, the remains of Olivia moved through the region in 1982, spurring spotty moderate to heavy rainfall across Idaho.\n\nHurricane Audrey directed moisture up to a front to its north across the Midwest during late June 1957 as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Heavy rains fell across central Illinois, leading to the wettest known event to be associated with a tropical cyclone or its remains across Illinois.\n\nSimilarly to Illinois, Indiana experienced its wettest tropical cyclone in 1957 with the arrival of Hurricane Audrey. In 1979, Hurricane Bob produced considerable flooding in the state.\n\nHurricane Carla was a large hurricane that moved into Texas during September 1961. As it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone across the Great Plains and Midwest, heavy rain fell in a band on the poleward side of a frontal boundary extending northeast from Carla, leading to the wettest known event to be associated with a tropical cyclone or its remains across Iowa.\n\nHeavy rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances fell from the western Gulf Coast northward into the Great Plains. Spreading across portions of Kansas, precipitation included with localized amounts above .\n\nSoon after moving inland, the 1960 Texas tropical storm looped over South Texas, leading to heavy rains along the coastal plain near Port Lavaca. As it moved north-northeast, bursts of heavy rainfall were accompanied with the\nsystem over Arkansas and Kentucky. The maximum in Kentucky not only represents their highest tropical cyclone-related rainfall amount on record, but also the state's all-time 24 hour precipitation record (through 1998).\n\nHeavy rains and flooding are the primary problem associated with tropical cyclones across the Pelican State. Recent examples of flooding across the state from tropical cyclones include Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, Tropical Storm Frances in 1998, Tropical Storm Allison in 1989, and Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979. Three of the four systems stalled across eastern Texas, prolonging the rainfall which occurred over Louisiana. If it were not for the intermittent invasions from tropical cyclones, rainfall during the months of August, September, and October would average about 25% less than it currently does.\n\nThe combined impact from a Nor'easter just one day before Daisy hit, and Hurricane Daisy, caused severe flooding in Maine, when rain fell for 65 consecutive hours in some locations. Rainfall from the two systems caused record rainfall in some areas in Maine. Flooding caused by Hurricane Irene's heavy rainfall washed out two bridges on State Route 27 in Carrabassett Valley.\n\nEloise's remnants brought great moisture to the Northeast third of the United States in the combination of warm, tropical air and cold air from a cold front. From Virginia through New Jersey, of rain were reported, while New York and Pennsylvania experienced . Westminster, Maryland received the maximum amount from the storm in this region with a total of . The 1935 Labor Day hurricane holds the record for producing the most rainfall in Maryland.\n\nThe wettest known tropical cyclone to impact New England is also the wettest known for the state of Massachusetts. The flood from Hurricane Diane led to a significant death toll (nearly 200) from Pennsylvania eastward through southern New England.\n\nIn 1961, Hurricane Carla generated more precipitation in Michigan than any other tropical cyclone has ever generated in the state. Carla is also the wettest tropical cyclone to have hit Iowa, Nebraska, and Wisconsin.\n\nFew tropical cyclone remnants originating from the eastern Pacific or Atlantic Basins make it as far north as Minnesota. Most recently, 2004's Hurricane Javier dropped heavy rainfall exceeding in localized spots.\n\nHurricane Georges stalled over the southern portion of the state, it produced torrential rainfall, exceeding locally. The heavy rainfall contributed to significant river overflowing, including the Tchoutacabouffa River at D'Iberville, which set a record crest of .\n\nRemnant tropical cyclones can move into the state which originate in either the Pacific or Atlantic hurricane basins. Tropical Storm Erin reintensified over Oklahoma leading to heavy rainfall in that state. As the system moved eastward, its surface low quickly dissipated. However, its mid-level circulation remained robust, leading to a burst of heavy rainfall across Missouri exceeding in isolated spots, which became the wettest tropical cyclone remnant on record for the state.\n\nIt is rare for tropical cyclone remnants originating from the eastern Pacific or Atlantic Basins to make it as far north as Montana. The remains of Kathleen dropped locally heavy rainfall approaching in localized spots.\n\nThe wettest known event in Nebraska to be associated with a tropical cyclone or its remains was Hurricane Carla. Carla resulted in the heaviest known rainfall in several other states as well.\n\nEvery few years, Nevada is impacted by eastern Pacific tropical cyclones, or their remnants. The wettest known event for the state was during Hurricane Doreen, when over fell in isolated spots.\n\nA large swath of heavy rainfall spread up the East Coast along a frontal zone draping over the northern side of Hurricane Floyd. Nearly fell across portions of New Hampshire, the most recorded during the passage of a tropical cyclone or its remnants.\n\nA large swath of heavy rainfall spread up the East Coast along a frontal zone draping over the northern side of Hurricane Floyd. Hurricane Four of the September 1940 hurricane season holds the record for the wettest tropical cyclone in New Jersey.\n\nTropical cyclones, and their remnants, move into New Mexico from both the eastern Pacific and Atlantic basins. Although Atlantic Basin tropical cyclones are more unusual events, the rainfall record for New Mexico was from a tropical depression which moved across Texas from the Gulf of Mexico in October 1954.\n\nTropical cyclones moving up the East Coast bring rainfall to New York frequently. During Hurricane Connie, over fell in isolated spots, which was the most rainfall recorded with a tropical cyclone or its remains across the state.\n\nHeavy rains accompany tropical cyclones and their remnants which move northeast from the Gulf of Mexico coastline, as well as inland from the western subtropical Atlantic ocean. As much as 15% of the rainfall which occurs during the warm season in the Carolinas is attributable to tropical cyclones. Over the past 30 years, the wettest tropical cyclone to strike the coastal plain was Hurricane Florence of September 2018, which dropped over of rainfall in Swansboro. In the mountains, Hurricane Frances of September 2004 was the wettest, bringing over of rainfall to Mount Mitchell.\n\nIt is rare for tropical cyclone remnants originating from the eastern Pacific or Atlantic Basins to migrate as far north as North Dakota. The remains of Javier in 2004 dropped locally heavy rainfall exceeding in localized spots.\n\nThe Northern Mariana Islands are an archipelago north of Guam which gets impacted by typhoons in the western Pacific from time to time. Typhoon Champi dropped on Tinian in 2015, making it the wettest known tropical cyclone for the island chain.\n\nThe state of Ohio can be impacted by the remnants of both eastern Pacific and Atlantic tropical cyclones, with a bulk of the activity originating in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane Frederic in 1979, interacting with a nearby frontal zone, brought over of rainfall to isolated spots of the state, becoming the wettest known tropical cyclone, or remnant, to impact Ohio.\n\nRemnant tropical cyclones can move into the state which originate in either the Pacific or Atlantic hurricane basins. In 2007, Tropical Storm Erin reintensified over Oklahoma leading to heavy rainfall within the state. Rainfall exceeded in isolated spots, which turned out to be the third wettest tropical cyclone remnant on record for Oklahoma.\n\nImpacts from tropical cyclones in the Pacific Northwest are rare. Most recently, the remains of Ignacio moved through the region, spurring spotty moderate rainfall across the region.\n\nAlthough Hurricane Agnes was barely a hurricane at landfall in Florida, its major impact was over the Mid-Atlantic region, where Agnes combined with a non-tropical low to produce widespread rains of with local amounts up to in western Schuylkill County in Pennsylvania. These rains produced widespread severe flooding from Virginia northward to New York, with other flooding occurring over the western portions of the Carolinas.\n\nPuerto Rico has seen dramatic rainfall from tropical cyclones and their precursor disturbances. The most recent tropical cyclone-related deluge was from Hurricane Irene in August 2011, when of rain was measured at Gurabo Abajo. The heaviest rainfall noted over the past 30 years was from the precursor disturbance to Tropical Storm Isabel, when fell at Toro Negro Forest. Hurricane Eloise of 1975 dropped of rainfall at Dos Bocas, with falling in 24 hours.\n\nThe flood from Hurricane Diane led to a significant death toll (nearly 200) from Pennsylvania eastward through southern New England.\n\nPortions of South Carolina experienced significant rainfall totals approaching with Hurricane Florence, which became the wettest known tropical cyclone to impact the state. The flash flooding covered numerous roadways and washed out bridges, with the statewide transportation damage totaling at least . River flooding was great across the state. In addition, the rainfall broke dams, flooded houses, and covered fields.\n\nIt is rare for tropical cyclone remnants originating from the eastern Pacific or Atlantic Basins to move as far inland as South Dakota. The remains of Javier in 2004 dropped locally heavy rainfall exceeding in localized spots.\n\nTropical Storm Chris moved inland into the Southeast, producing a burst of rainfall across Tennessee exceeding . This system stands as Tennessee's wettest known tropical cyclone.\n\nThe most serious threat from tropical cyclones in Texas residents is from flooding, from both Gulf of Mexico hurricanes and tropical storms and the remnants of Eastern Pacific storms. Systems with sprawling circulations, such as Hurricane Beulah, also tend to make good rainmakers. Slow moving systems, such as Tropical Storm Amelia or Hurricane Harvey also can produce significant rainfall over Texas. Harvey's storm total rainfall is the most recorded within the United States. Harvey's extremely heavy rainfall produced catastrophic flooding across much of southeastern Texas; particularly in and around the Houston metropolitan area, where accumulations exceeded over a four-day period. Tropical Storm Claudette holds the national 24-hour rainfall record for the United States, with falling within a day.\n\nTropical cyclones affect these islands of the northeast Caribbean on a regular basis. Hurricane Hortense is the wettest known system for the U. S. Virgin Islands, bringing over of rainfall.\n\nOn occasion, Utah is impacted by the remnants of eastern Pacific tropical cyclones. The remains of Olivia moved through the region in 1982, spurring spotty moderate to heavy rainfall exceeding in isolated spots.\n\nA large swath over heavy rainfall spread up the East Coast along a frontal zone draped over the northern side of Hurricane Floyd. Over fell across portions of Vermont, the most recorded during the passage of a tropical cyclone or its remnants within the state.\n\nVirginia has some special considerations that affect tropical cyclone-related rainfall. Mountains to the west act as a perfect mechanism for upward motion during sustained east winds, which can lead to flash flooding and landslides in that region (e.g. Hurricane Camille). As a tropical system approaches from the south, a frontal zone sets up between the moist Atlantic Ocean and the drier landmass to the west. This boundary can set up two or three days in advance of a tropical storm, and can lead up to prolonged heavy rains across coastal sections (e.g. Hurricane Floyd). As the cyclone advances north, the boundary will slowly shift west, but progresses west of a Richmond/Washington, D.C. line.\n\nImpacts from tropical cyclones in the Pacific Northwest are rare. The remains of Ignacio moved through the region, spurring spotty moderate rainfall across the region.\n\nAlthough Hurricane Agnes was barely a hurricane at landfall in Florida, its major impact was over the Mid-Atlantic region, where Agnes combined with a non-tropical low to produce widespread heavy rainfall, including amounts approaching in isolated spots of West Virginia. These rains produced widespread severe flooding from Virginia northward to New York, with other flooding occurring over the western portions of the Carolinas.\n\nWisconsin experienced its heaviest tropical-cyclone-related rainfall in 1961 when Hurricane Carla entered the United States. Carla broke the record for highest rainfall in three other states as well.\n\nFew tropical cyclone remnants originating from the eastern Pacific make it as far north as Wyoming. Most recently, Hurricane Javier dropped locally heavy rainfall of up to in the higher terrain of western Wyoming.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1161775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1161775", "title": "Log driving", "text": "Log driving\n\nLog driving is a means of moving logs (sawn tree trunks) from a forest to sawmills and pulp mills downstream using the current of a river. It was the main transportation method of the early logging industry in Europe and North America.\n\nWhen the first sawmills were established, they were usually small water powered facilities located near the source of timber, which might be converted to grist mills after farming became established when the forests had been cleared. Later, bigger circular sawmills were developed in the lower reaches of a river, with the logs floated down to them by log drivers. In the broader, slower stretches of a river, the logs might be bound together into timber rafts. In the smaller, wilder stretches of a river, rafts couldn't get through, so masses of individual logs were driven down the river like huge herds of cattle.\nThe log drive was one step in a larger process of lumber-making in remote places. In a location with snowy winters, the yearly process typically began in the fall when a small team of men hauled tools upstream into the timbered area, chopped out a clearing, and constructed crude buildings for a logging camp. In the winter when things froze down, a larger crew moved into the camp and proceeded to cut trees, cutting the trunks into lengths, and hauling the logs with oxen or horses over iced trails to the riverbank. There the logs were decked onto \"rollways.\" In the spring when snow thawed and water levels rose, the logs were rolled into the river, and the drive commenced.\n\nTo ensure that logs drifted freely along the river, men called \"log drivers\" or \"river pigs\" were needed to guide the logs. The drivers typically divided into two groups. The more experienced and nimble men comprised the \"jam\" crew or \"beat\" crew. They watched the spots where logs were likely to jam, and when a jam started, tried to get to it quickly and dislodge the key logs before many logs stacked up. If they didn't, the river would keep piling on more logs, forming a partial dam which could raise the water level. Millions of board feet of lumber could back up for miles upriver, requiring weeks to break up, with some lumber possibly lost if it was shoved far enough into the shallows. So when the jam crew saw a jam start, they rushed to it and tried to break it up, using peaveys and possibly dynamite. This job required some understanding of physics, strong muscles, and extreme agility. The jam crew was an exceedingly dangerous occupation, with the drivers standing on the moving logs and running from one to another. Many drivers lost their lives by falling and being crushed by the logs.\nEach crew was accompanied by an experienced boss often selected for his fighting skills to control the strong and reckless men of his team. The overall drive was controlled by the \"walking boss\" who moved from place to place to coordinate the various teams to keep logs moving past problem spots. Stalling a drive near a saloon often created a cascade of drunken personnel problems.\n\nA larger group of less experienced men brought up the rear, pushing along the straggler logs that were stuck on the banks and in trees. They spent more time wading in icy water than balancing on moving logs. They were called the \"rear crew.\" Other men worked with them from the bank, pushing logs away with pike poles. Others worked with horses and oxen to pull in the logs that had strayed furthest out into the flats.\n\nBateaux ferried log drivers using pike poles to dislodge stranded logs while maneuvering with the log drive. A wannigan was a kitchen built on a raft which followed the drivers down the river. The wannigan served four meals a day to fuel the men working in cold water. It also provided tents and blankets for the night if no better accommodations were available. A commissary wagon carrying clothing, plug tobacco and patent medicines for purchase by the log drivers was also called a wangan. The logging company wangan train, called a \"Mary Anne\", was a caravan of wagons pulled by four- or six-horse teams where roads followed the river to transport the tents, blankets, food, stoves, and tools needed by the log drivers.\n\nFor log drives, the ideal river would have been straight and uniform, with sharp banks and a predictable flow of water. Wild rivers were not that, so men cut away the fallen trees that would snag logs, dynamited troublesome rocks, and built up the banks in places. To control the flow of water, they built \"flash dams\" or \"driving dams\" on smaller streams, so they could release water to push the logs down when they wanted.\n\nEach timber firm had its own mark which was placed on the logs, called an \"end mark\". Obliterating or altering a timber mark was a crime. At the mill the logs were captured by a log boom, and the logs were sorted for ownership before being sawn.\n\nLog drives were often in conflict with navigation, as logs would sometimes fill the entire river and make boat travel dangerous or impossible.\n\nFloating logs down a river worked well for the most desirable pine timber, because it floated well. But hardwoods were more dense, and didn't float well enough to be easily driven, and some pines weren't near drivable streams. Log driving became increasingly unnecessary with the development of railroads and the use of trucks on logging roads. However, the practice survived in some remote locations where such infrastructure did not exist. Most log driving in the United States and Canada ended with changes in environmental legislation in the 1970s. Some places, like the Catalan Pyrenees, still retain the practice as a popular holiday celebration once a year.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2458523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2458523", "title": "Mami Wata", "text": "Mami Wata\n\nMami Wata (Mammy Water) is a water deity venerated in West, Central, and Southern Africa, and in the African diaspora in the Americas. Mami Wata spirits are usually female, but are sometimes male.\n\nThe appearance of her hair ranges from straight, curly to kinky black and combed straight back. Incorrectly, mostly western sources have suggested the name \"Mami Wata\" is pidgin English for \"Mother Water\". This is impossible as the deities existed in Africa long before colonization on the continent allowed English to infiltrate. The Mami Wata name is Ethiopian and Egyptian in origin and is linked to ancient African culture, spiritual belief systems, and folklore. The Ethiopian words \"mama\" indicated wisdom or truth while \"uat-ur\" meant ocean water. Additionally, in some early languages of the Sudan \"wata\" referred to a woman. Commonly thought to be a single entity, the term actually refers to a pantheon of African water deities. These African cultures were matriarchical and though \"Mami Wata\" can refer to males and females, they are most typically thought of as feminine and often take on a female form in art.\nMami Wata is often described as a mermaid-like figure, with a woman's upper body (often nude) and the hindquarters of a fish or serpent. In other tales, Mami Wata is fully human in appearance (though never human). The existence and spiritual importance of Mami Wata is deeply rooted in the ancient tradition and mythology of the coastal southeastern Nigerians (Efik, Ibibio and Annang people). Mami Wata often carries expensive baubles such as combs, mirrors, and watches. A large snake (symbol of divination and divinity) frequently accompanies her, wrapping itself around her and laying its head between her breasts. Other times, she may try to pass as completely human, wandering busy markets or patronising bars. She may also manifest in a number of other forms, including as a man. Traders in the 20th century carried similar beliefs with them from Senegal to as far as Zambia. As the Mami Wata traditions continued to re-emerge, native water deities were subsumed into it.\n\nTraditions on both sides of the Atlantic tell of the spirit abducting her followers or random people whilst they are swimming or boating. She brings them to her paradisiacal realm, which may be underwater, in the spirit world, or both. Should she allow them to leave, the travellers usually return in dry clothing and with a new spiritual understanding reflected in their gaze. These returnees often grow wealthier, more attractive, and more easygoing after the encounter.\n\nVan Stipriaan further reports that other tales describe river travellers (usually men) chancing upon the spirit. She is inevitably grooming herself, combing her hair, and peering at herself in a mirror. Upon noticing the intruder, she flees into the water and leaves her possessions behind. The traveller then takes the invaluable items. Later, Mami Wata appears to the thief in his dreams to demand the return of her things. Should he agree, she further demands a promise from him to be sexually faithful to her. Agreement grants the person riches; refusal to return the possessions or to be faithful brings the man ill fortune.\n\nHer worship is as diverse as her initiates, priesthood and worshippers, although some parallels may be drawn. Groups of people may gather in her name, but the spirit is much more prone to interacting with followers on a one-on-one basis. She thus has many priests and mediums in Africa, America and in the Caribbean who are specifically born and initiated to her.\n\nIn Nigeria, devotees typically wear red and white clothing, as these colors represent that particular Mami's dual nature. In Igbo iconography, red represents such qualities as death, destruction, heat, being male, physicality, and power. In contrast, white symbolises death, but also can symbolize beauty, creation, being female, new life, spirituality, translucence, water, and wealth. This regalia may also include a cloth snake wrapped about the waist. The Mami Wata shrines may also be decorated in these colors, and items such as bells, carvings, Christian or Indian prints, dolls, incense, spirits, and remnants of previous sacrifices often adorn such places.\n\nIntense dancing accompanied by musical instruments such as African guitars or harmonicas often forms the core of Mami Wata worship. Followers dance to the point of entering a trance. At this point, Mami Wata possesses the person and speaks to him or her. Offerings to the spirit are also important, and Mami Wata prefers gifts of delicious food and drink, alcohol, fragrant objects (such as pomade, powder, incense, and soap), and expensive goods like jewelry. Modern worshippers usually leave her gifts of manufactured goods, such as Coca-Cola or designer jewelry.\n\nNevertheless, she largely wants her followers to be healthy and well off. More broadly, people blame the spirit for all sorts of misfortune. In Cameroon, for example, Mami Wata is ascribed with causing the strong undertow that kills many swimmers each year along the coast.\n\nAccording to Bastian, Mami Wata's association with sex and lust is somewhat paradoxically linked to one with fidelity. According to a Nigerian tradition, male followers may encounter the spirit in the guise of a beautiful, sexually promiscuous woman, such as a prostitute. In Nigerian popular stories, Mami Wata may seduce a favoured male devotee and then show herself to him following coitus. She then demands his complete sexual faithfulness and secrecy about the matter. Acceptance means wealth and fortune; rejection spells the ruin of his family, finances, and job.\n\nAnother prominent aspect of the Mami Wata deities is their connection to healing. If someone comes down with an incurable, languorous illness, Mami Wata often takes the blame. The illness is evidence that Mami Wata has taken an interest in the afflicted person and that only she can cure him or her. Similarly, several other ailments may be attributed to the water spirit. In Nigeria, for example, she takes the blame for everything from headaches to sterility.\n\nIn fact, barren mothers often call upon the spirit to cure their affliction. Many traditions hold that Mami Wata herself is barren, so if she gives a woman a child, that woman inherently becomes more distanced from the spirit's true nature. The woman will thus be less likely to become wealthy or attractive through her devotion to Mami Wata. Images of women with children often decorate shrines to the spirit.\n\nAs other deities become absorbed into the figure of Mami Wata, the spirit often takes on characteristics unique to a particular region or culture. In Trinidad and Tobago, for example, Maman Dlo plays the role of guardian of nature, punishing overzealous hunters or woodcutters. She is the lover of Papa Bois, a nature spirit.\n\nIt is believed that all of ancient Africa possessed a multitude of water-spirit traditions before the first contact with Europeans. Most of these were regarded as female. Dual natures of good and evil were not uncommon, reflecting the fact that water is an important means of providing communication, food, drink, trade, and transportation, but it can drown people, flood fields or villages, and provide passage to intruders. Van Stipriaan suggests that she may be based on the West African manatee, which is an idea that has been proposed by scientists of the Ghanaian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR); in fact, \"Mami Wata\" is a common name for this animal in the region. Jill Salmons argues that the mermaid image may have come into being after contact with Europeans. The ships of traders and slavers often had carvings of mermaid figures on their prows, for example, and tales of mermaids were popular among sailors of the time. On the other hand, white is traditionally associated with the spirit world in many cultures of Nigeria. The people of the Cross River area often whiten their skin with talcum or other substances for rituals and for cosmetic reasons, for example.\n\nVan Stipriaan speculates that Liberian traders of the Kru ethnic group moved up and down the west coast of Africa from Liberia to Cameroon beginning in the 19th century. They may have spread their own water-spirit beliefs with them and helped to standardise conceptions in West Africa. Their perceived wealth may have helped establish the spirit as one of good fortune.\n\nAccording to a Mami Wata chieftain, Hounnon Behumbeza, who was himself appointed high priest of the Mami Wata tradition in West Africa (Benin, Togo and Ghana), \"The Mami Wata tradition consists of a huge pantheon of deities and spirits, not just the often portrayed mermaid\". Behumbeza goes on to say that \"true knowledge and understanding of Mami Wata is shared with those initiated into the priesthood of Mami and with those who hear the calling for initiation into her mysteries.\"\n\nVan Stipriaan also believes that this period introduced West Africa to what would become the definitive image of Mami Wata. Circa 1887, a chromolithograph of a female Samoan snake charmer appeared in Nigeria. According to the British art historian Kenneth C. Murray, the poster was titled \"Der Schlangenbändiger\" (\"The Snake Charmer\") and was originally created sometime between 1880 and 1887. Dr. Tobias Wendl, director of the Iwalewa-Haus Africa Centre at the University of Bayreuth, was unable to confirm this after extensive searching (as \"Der Schlangenbändiger\" is a masculine term, the title seems suspect). He did discover a very similar photograph titled \"Die samoanische Schlangenbändigerin Maladamatjaute\" (\"the Samoan Snake Charmer (fem.) Maladamatjaute\") in the collection of the Wilhelm-Zimmermann Archive in Hamburg. Whichever the original image, it was almost certainly a poster of a celebrated late 19th-century snake charmer who performed under the stage name \"Nala Damajanti\", which appeared in several variations, particularly \"Maladamatjaute\", at numerous venues, including the Folies Bergère in 1886. This identification was also made by Drewal in a 2012 book chapter on Mami Wata. Despite exotic claims of her nationality, she was later identified as one Émilie Poupon of Nantey, France.\n\nThis image—an enticing woman with long, black hair and a large snake slithering up between her breasts, ambiguous if she is human or mermaid beyond the image—apparently caught the imaginations of the Africans who saw it; it was the definitive image of the spirit. Before long, Mami Wata posters appeared in over a dozen countries and the popular image was reproduced in 1955 by the Shree Ram Calendar Company in Bombay for the African market. People began creating Mami Wata art of their own, much of it influenced by the lithograph.\n\nAccording to photographer Van Stipriaan and some western anthropologists, the various West African religions came to resemble one another during the 20th century, especially in urban areas. The homogenisation was largely the result of greater communication and mobility of individuals from town to town and country to country, though links between the spirit's nature and the perils of the urban environment have also been proposed. This led to a new level of standardisation of priests, initiations of new devotees, healing rituals, and temples.\n\nThe 20th century also led to Mami Wata's reemergence in much of Central and Southern Africa. In the mid-1950s, traders imported copies of \"The Snake Charmer\" from Bombay and England and sold them throughout Africa. West African traders moved her to Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in that same decade. There the spirit became a popular subject of Congolese folk painters, who placed her on the walls of bars, stores, and marketplace stalls. Senegalese traders and Congolese immigrants probably brought her worship to Zambia by the 1970s. Meanwhile, Congolese and Zambian artists spread Mami Wata images throughout public places in Zambia. Further diffusion might have occurred during the Biafran secessionist Nigerian Civil War, which began in 1967. Refugees fled to all parts of West and Central Africa, bringing with them their belief in the water spirit.\n\nModern DRC, Lesotho, South Africa, and Zambia today form the current boundary of the Mami Wata cult, albeit a blurred one. The pan-African water spirit is assimilating native water spirits in this region, many of them serpent figures. Some examples are the Congolese-Zambian \"chitapo\" or \"nakamwale\", the South African \"umamlambo\", and the Sotho \"mamolapo\" or \"mamogashoa\". The most visible evidence of this absorption is that many of these creatures are today viewed as mermaids rather than snakes, their traditional form. These adoptions often lead to confusion when aspects of more than one being become amalgamated under the name \"Mami Wata\". In Southern Africa, for example, Mami Wata is sometimes said to be able to fly around in the form of a tornado, an adopted aspect from the \"khanyapa\" water spirit.\n\nThe new environment only served to emphasize the enslaved's connection to water. In Guiana, for example, slaves had to fight back swamp waters on the plantations they worked. She was first mentioned in Dutch Guiana in the 1740s in the journal of an anonymous colonist: \n\nSlaves worshipped the spirit by dancing and then falling into a trancelike state. In the 1770s, the Dutch rulers outlawed the ritual dances associated with the spirit. The governor, J. Nepveu, wrote that \n\nNative Americans of the colony adopted Watermama from the slaves and merged her with their own water spirits.\n\nBy the 19th century, an influx of enslaved Africans from other regions had relegated Watermama to a position in the pantheon of the deities of the Surinamese Winti religion. When Winti was outlawed in the 1970s, her religious practices lost some of their importance in Suriname. Furthermore, a relative lack of freedom compared to their African brethren prevented the homogenisation that occurred with the Mami Wata cult across the Atlantic.\n\nIn Haiti, Lasirenn is a Vodou loa who represents Mami Wata. She is described as a strong-willed, sensual siren who possesses the ability to drown those enticed by her. Lasirenn is often depicted as a half-fish, half-human being, but is occasionally portrayed as a whale. Similar to many other depictions of Mami Wata, Lasirenn is often shown gazing at herself in a mirror, a symbolic representation of her beauty. She is often associated with queer relationships among Black women.\n\nMami Wata is a popular subject in the art, fiction, poetry, music, and film of the Caribbean and West and Central Africa. Visual artists especially seem drawn to her image, and both wealthier Africans and tourists buy paintings and wooden sculptures of the spirit. She also figures prominently in the folk art of Africa, with her image adorning walls of bars and living rooms, album covers, and other items.\n\nMami Wata has also proved to be a popular theme in African and Caribbean literature. Authors who have featured her in their fiction include Wayne Gerard Trotman as Mama Dlo in his novel \"Kaya Abaniah and the Father of the Forest\", Patrick Chamoiseau, Alex Godard, Rose Marie Guiraud (Côte d'Ivoire), Flora Nwapa, and Véronique Tadjo (Côte d'Ivoire). \"Mamy-Wata\" is also the title of a satirical Cameroonian newspaper.\n\nThe character Mami Watanabe from the comic book \"Factionalists\" is the physical manifestation of the spirit entity Mami Wata. The author utilized a number of features to convey this. Her name Mami Watanabe is a play on Mami Wata. Despite being Japanese, her skin is darkened in the Japanese ganguro style. She also has a tattoo of a snake on her body and receives a watch and a mirror as gifts in the series, two items generally associated with Mami Wata.\n\nSinger-songwriter S.J. Tucker recorded a song named \"La Sirene\" in honor of Mami Watanabe. Trumpeter Hugh Masekela recorded a song titled \"Mami Wata\", which appears on the CD version of his album \"The Boy's Doin' It\".\n\nMami Wata appeared in the second season of the Canadian television show \"Lost Girl\" on Showcase Television. She is also referred to in the television show \"River Monsters\" while Jeremy Wade is fishing in the Congo River in the episode \"Congo Killer\". She is referred to again in the \"Body Snatcher\" episode set in Guyana. In this second episode, Wade speculates that legends of Mami Wata in Guyana could have originated by Arapaima attacks.\n\nIn Nigerian-American author Nnedi Okorafor's 2014 speculative fiction novel \"Lagoon\", an alien spaceship appears beneath the waters of Lagos Lagoon and the new arrivals cause transformations in the natural and human world. When the first alien ambassador sets foot on the Bar Beach in human female form, then disappears into the sea, a local boy compares her to Mami Wata. Later, an antagonist interprets another alien in female form as Mami Wata and surrenders to her seduction, accompanying her into the sea to be transformed.\n\nRapper Azealia Banks is well known for her mermaid aesthetic. During the release of her debut mixtape \"Fantasea\", Banks embarked on a worldwide Mermaid Ball tour. The Mermaid Ball was an amalgamation of seahorses, bubbles, and a number of nods to Disney's \"The Little Mermaid\". In reference to Fantasea's theme, Banks states that the mixtape was inspired by Yemaya.\n\n\n\n"}

By merely observing at a given instance without any manipulation in its natural context, it makes the behaviors exhibited more credible because they are occurring in a real, typical scenario as opposed to an artificial one generated within a lab. Naturalistic observation also allows for study of events that are deemed unethical to study via experimental models, such as the impact of high school shootings on students attending the high school.

Different platforms employ a large variety of sensors, which operate in a wide range of often hostile environments and use different measurement protocols. Occasionally, buoys are left unattended for extended periods of time, while ships may involve a certain amount of the human-related impacts in data collection and transmission. Therefore, quality control is necessary before in situ data can be further used in scientific research or other applications. This is an example of quality control and monitoring of sea surface temperatures measured by ships and buoys, the iQuam system developed at NOAA/NESDIS/STAR, where statistics show the quality of \"in situ\" measurements of sea surface temperatures.\n\nOne of the problems facing real-time ocean observatories is the ability to provide a fast and accurate assessment of the data quality. Ocean Networks Canada is in the process of implementing real-time quality control on incoming data. For scalar data, the aim is to meet the guidelines of the Quality Assurance of Real Time Oceanographic Data (QARTOD) group. QARTOD is a US organization tasked with identifying issues involved with incoming real-time data from the U.S Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). A large portion of their agenda is to create guidelines for how the quality of real-time data is to be determined and reported to the scientific community. Real-time data quality testing at Ocean Networks Canada includes tests designed to catch instrument failures and major spikes or data dropouts before the data is made available to the user. Real-time quality tests include meeting instrument manufacturer’s standards and overall observatory/site ranges determined from previous data. Due to the positioning of some instrument platforms in highly productive areas, we have also designed dual-sensor tests e.g. for some conductivity sensors.

{"id": "24253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24253", "title": "Persephone", "text": "Persephone\n\nIn Greek mythology, Persephone ( ; ), also called Kore ( ; \"the maiden\"), is the daughter of Zeus and Demeter. Homer describes her as the formidable, venerable majestic princess of the underworld, who carries into effect the curses of men upon the souls of the dead. She becomes the queen of the underworld through her abduction by and subsequent marriage to Hades, the god of the underworld. The myth of her abduction represents her function as the personification of vegetation, which shoots forth in spring and withdraws into the earth after harvest; hence, she is also associated with spring as well as the fertility of vegetation. Similar myths appear in the Orient, in the cults of male gods like Attis, Adonis, and Osiris, and in Minoan Crete. \n\nPersephone as a vegetation goddess and her mother Demeter were the central figures of the Eleusinian mysteries, which promised the initiated a more enjoyable prospect after death. In some versions, Persephone is the mother of Zeus's sons Dionysus, Iacchus, or Zagreus. The origins of her cult are uncertain, but it was based on very old agrarian cults of agricultural communities.\n\nPersephone was commonly worshipped along with Demeter and with the same mysteries. To her alone were dedicated the mysteries celebrated at Athens in the month of Anthesterion. In Classical Greek art, Persephone is invariably portrayed \nrobed, often carrying a sheaf of grain. She may appear as a mystical divinity with a sceptre and a little box, but she was mostly represented in the process of being carried off by Hades.\n\nIn Roman mythology, she is called Proserpina, and her mother, Ceres and her father Jupiter.\n\nIn a Linear B (Mycenean Greek) inscription on a tablet found at Pylos dated 1400–1200 BC, John Chadwick reconstructed the name of a goddess \"*Preswa\" who could be identified with Persa, daughter of Oceanus and found speculative the further identification with the first element of Persephone. \"Persephonē\" (Greek: ) is her name in the Ionic Greek of epic literature. The Homeric form of her name is \"Persephoneia\" (Περσεφονεία, \"Persephoneia\"). In other dialects, she was known under variant names: \"Persephassa\" (), \"Persephatta\" (), or simply \"Korē\" (, \"girl, maiden\"). Plato calls her \"Pherepapha\" () in his \"Cratylus\", \"because she is wise and touches that which is in motion\". There are also the forms \"Periphona\" (Πηριφόνα) and \"Phersephassa\" (). The existence of so many different forms shows how difficult it was for the Greeks to pronounce the word in their own language and suggests that the name may have a Pre-Greek origin.\n\n\"Persephatta\" () is considered to mean \"female thresher of grain\"; the first constituent of the name originates in Proto-Greek \"perso-\" (related to Sanskrit \"parṣa-\"), \"sheaf of grain\" and the second constituent of the name originates in Proto-Indo European ', from the root ' \"to strike\".\n\nA popular folk etymology is from , \"pherein phonon\", \"to bring (or cause) death\".\n\nThe Romans first heard of her from the Aeolian and Dorian cities of Magna Graecia, who used the dialectal variant \"Proserpinē\" (). Hence, in Roman mythology she was called Proserpina, a name erroneously derived by the Romans from \"proserpere\", \"to shoot forth\" and as such became an emblematic figure of the Renaissance.\n\nAt Locri, perhaps uniquely, Persephone was the protector of marriage, a role usually assumed by Hera; in the iconography of votive plaques at Locri, her abduction and marriage to Hades served as an emblem of the marital state, children at Locri were dedicated to Proserpina, and maidens about to be wed brought their \"peplos\" to be blessed.\n\nIn a Classical period text ascribed to Empedocles, c. 490 – 430 BC, describing a correspondence among four deities and the classical elements, the name \"Nestis\" for water apparently refers to Persephone: \"Now hear the fourfold roots of everything: enlivening Hera, Hades, shining Zeus. And Nestis, moistening mortal springs with tears.\"\n\nOf the four deities of Empedocles' elements, it is the name of Persephone alone that is taboo—Nestis is a euphemistic cult title—for she was also the terrible Queen of the Dead, whose name was not safe to speak aloud, who was euphemistically named simply as Kore or \"the Maiden\", a vestige of her archaic role as the deity ruling the underworld.\n\nThe epithets of Persephone reveal her double function as chthonic and vegetation goddess. The surnames given to her by the poets refer to her character as Queen of the lower world and the dead, or her symbolic meaning of the power that shoots forth and withdraws into the earth. Her common name as a vegetation goddess is Kore, and in Arcadia she was worshipped under the title Despoina, \"the mistress\", a very old chthonic divinity. Plutarch identifies her with spring and Cicero calls her the seed of the fruits of the fields. In the Eleusinian mysteries, her return is the symbol of immortality and hence she was frequently represented on sarcophagi.\n\nIn the mystical theories of the Orphics and the Platonists, Kore is described as the all-pervading goddess of nature who both produces and destroys everything, and she is therefore mentioned along or identified with other mystic divinities such as Isis, Rhea, Ge, Hestia, Pandora, Artemis, and Hecate. The Orphic Persephone is further said to have become by Zeus the mother of Dionysus, Iacchus, Zagreus, and the little-attested Melinoe.\n\nAs a goddess of the underworld, Persephone was given euphemistically friendly names. However it is possible that some of them were the names of original goddesses:\n\nAs a vegetation goddess, she was called:\n\nDemeter and her daughter Persephone were usually called:\n\nThe myth of a goddess being abducted and taken to the Underworld is probably Pre-Greek in origin. Samuel Noah Kramer, the renowned scholar of ancient Sumer, has posited that the Greek story of the abduction of Persephone may be derived from an ancient Sumerian story in which Ereshkigal, the ancient Sumerian goddess of the Underworld, is abducted by Kur, the primeval dragon of Sumerian mythology, and forced to become ruler of the Underworld against her own will.\n\nThe location of Persephone's abduction is different in each local cult. The \"Homeric Hymn to Demeter\" mentions the \"plain of Nysa\". The locations of this probably mythical place may simply be conventions to show that a magically distant chthonic land of myth was intended in the remote past. Demeter found and met her daughter in Eleusis, and this is the mythical disguise of what happened in the mysteries.\n\nPersephone is an old chthonic deity of the agricultural communities, who received the souls of the dead into the earth, and acquired powers over the fertility of the soil, over which she reigned. The earliest depiction of a goddess who may be identified with Persephone growing out of the ground, is on a plate from the Old-Palace period in Phaistos. The goddess has a vegetable-like appearance, and she is surrounded by dancing girls between blossoming flowers. A similar representation, where the goddess appears to come down from the sky, is depicted on the Minoan ring of Isopata.\n\nIn some forms Hades appears with his chthonic horses. The myth of the rape of Kore was derived from the idea that Hades catches the souls of the dead and then carries them with his horses into his kingdom. This idea is vague in Homer, but appears in later Greek depictions, and in Greek folklore. \"Charos\" appears with his horse and carries the dead into the underworld.\n\nThe cults of Persephone and Demeter in the Eleusinian mysteries and in the Thesmophoria were based on old agrarian cults.\nA lot of ancient beliefs were based on initiation into jealously-guarded mysteries (secret rites) because they offered prospects after death more enjoyable than the final end at the gloomy space of the Greek Hades. There is evidence that some practices were derived from the religious practices of the Mycenaean age. Kerenyi asserts that these religious practices were introduced from Minoan Crete., The idea of immortality which appears in the syncretistic religions of the Near East did not exist in the Eleusinian mysteries at the very beginning.\n\nIn the Near eastern myth of the early agricultural societies, every year the fertility goddess bore the \"god of the new year\", who then became her lover, and died immediately in order to be reborn and face the same destiny. Some findings from Catal Huyuk since the Neolithic age, indicate the worship of the Great Goddess accompanied by a boyish consort, who symbolizes the annual decay and return of vegetation. Similar cults of resurrected gods appear in the Near East and Egypt in the cults of Attis, Adonis and Osiris.\n\nIn Minoan Crete, the \"divine child\" was related to the female vegetation divinity Ariadne who died every year. The Minoan religion had its own characteristics. The most peculiar feature of the Minoan belief in the divine, is the appearance of the goddess from above in the dance. Dance floors have been discovered in addition to \"vaulted tombs\", and it seems that the dance was ecstatic. Homer memorializes the dance floor which Daedalus built for Ariadne in the remote past. On the gold ring from Isopata, four women in festal attire are performing a dance between blossoming flowers. Above a figure apparently floating in the air seems to be the goddess herself, appearing amid the whirling dance. An image plate from the first palace of Phaistos, seems to be very close to the mythical image of the \"Anodos\" (ascent) of Persephone. Two girls dance between blossoming flowers, on each side of a similar but armless and legless figure which seems to grow out of the ground. The goddess is bordered by snake lines which give her a vegetable like appearance She has a large stylized flower turned over her head. The resemblance with the flower-picking Persephone and her companions is compelling. The depiction of the goddess is similar to later images of \"Anodos of Pherephata\". On the Dresden vase, Persephone is growing out of the ground, and she is surrounded by the animal-tailed agricultural gods Silenoi.\n\nKerenyi suggests that the name Ariadne (derived from , \"hagne\", \"pure\"), was an euphemistical name given by the Greeks to the nameless \"Mistress of the labyrinth\" who appears in a Mycenean Greek inscription from Knossos in Crete. The Greeks used to give friendly names to the deities of the underworld. Cthonic Zeus was called Eubuleus, \"the good counselor\", and the ferryman of the river of the underworld Charon, \"glad\". Despoina and \"Hagne\" were probably euphemistic surnames of Persephone, therefore he theorizes that the cult of Persephone was the continuation of the worship of a Minoan Great goddess. The labyrinth was both a winding dance-ground and, in the Greek view, a prison with the dreaded Minotaur at its centre. It is possible that some religious practices, especially the mysteries, were transferred from a Cretan priesthood to Eleusis, where Demeter brought the poppy from Crete. Besides these similarities, Burkert explains that up to now it is not known to what extent one can and must differentiate between Minoan and Mycenean religion. In the Anthesteria Dionysos is the \"divine child\".\n\nThere is evidence of a cult in Eleusis from the Mycenean period; however, there are not sacral finds from this period. The cult was private and there is no information about it. As well as the names of some Greek gods in the Mycenean Greek inscriptions, also appear names of goddesses, like \"the divine Mother\" (the mother of the gods) or \"the Goddess (or priestess) of the winds\", who don't have Mycenean origin . In historical times, Demeter and Kore were usually referred to as \"the goddesses\" or \"the mistresses\" (Arcadia) in the mysteries . In the Mycenean Greek tablets dated 1400–1200 BC, the \"two queens and the king\" are mentioned. John Chadwick believes that these were the precursor divinities of Demeter, Persephone and Poseidon. \n\nSome information can be obtained from the study of the cult of Eileithyia at Crete, and the cult of Despoina. In the cave of Amnisos at Crete, Eileithyia is related with the annual birth of the divine child and she is connected with \"Enesidaon\" (The earth shaker), who is the chthonic aspect of the god Poseidon. \nPersephone was conflated with Despoina, \"the mistress\", a chthonic divinity in West-Arcadia. The megaron of Eleusis is quite similar with the \"megaron\" of Despoina at Lycosura. Demeter is united with the god Poseidon, and she bears a daughter, the unnameable Despoina. Poseidon appears as a horse, as it usually happens in Northern European folklore. The goddess of nature and her companion survived in the Eleusinian cult, where the following words were uttered \"Mighty Potnia bore a great sun\". In Eleusis, in a ritual, one child (\"pais\") was initiated from the hearth. The name \"pais\" (the divine child) appears in the Mycenean inscriptions, and the ritual indicates the transition from the old funerary practices to the Greek cremation.\n\nIn Greek mythology Nysa is a mythical mountain with an unknown location. \"Nysion\" (or Mysion), the place of the abduction of Persephone was also probably a mythical place which did not exist on the map, a magically distant chthonic land of myth which was intended in the remote past.\n\nThe story of her abduction by Hades can be seen as either consensual or against her will, is traditionally referred to as the Rape of Persephone. It is mentioned briefly in Hesiod's Theogony, and told in considerable detail in the \"Homeric Hymn to Demeter\". Persephone used to live far away from the other gods, a goddess within Nature herself before the days of planting seeds and nurturing plants. In the Olympian telling, the gods Ares, Hermes and Apollo had wooed Persephone; but Demeter rejected all their gifts and hid her daughter away from the company of the Olympian gods. Zeus, it is said, permitted Hades, who was in love with the beautiful Persephone, to abduct her as her mother Demeter was not likely to allow her daughter to go down to Hades. Persephone was gathering flowers with the Oceanids along with Artemis and Athena—the \"Homeric Hymn\" says—in a field when Hades came to abduct her, bursting through a cleft in the earth. Demeter, when she found her daughter had disappeared, searched for her all over the earth with Hecate's torches. In most versions she forbids the earth to produce, or she neglects the earth and in the depth of her despair she causes nothing to grow. Helios, the sun, who sees everything, eventually told Demeter what had happened and at length she discovered the place of her abode. Finally, Zeus, pressed by the cries of the hungry people and by the other deities who also heard their anguish, forced Hades to return Persephone.\n\nHades indeed complied with the request, but first he tricked her, giving her some pomegranate seeds to eat. Persephone was released by Hermes, who had been sent to retrieve her, but because she had tasted food in the underworld, she was obliged to spend a third of each year (the winter months) there, and the remaining part of the year with the gods above. With the later writers Ovid and Hyginus, Persephone's time in the underworld becomes half the year.\n\nVarious local traditions place Persephone's abduction in a different location. The Sicilians, among whom her worship was probably introduced by the Corinthian and Megarian colonists, believed that Hades found her in the meadows near Enna, and that a well arose on the spot where he descended with her into the lower world. The Cretans thought that their own island had been the scene of the rape, and the Eleusinians mentioned the Nysian plain in Boeotia, and said that Persephone had descended with Hades into the lower world at the entrance of the western Oceanus. Later accounts place the rape in Attica, near Athens, or near Eleusis.\nThe Homeric hymn mentions the \"Nysion\" (or Mysion) which was probably a mythical place. The location of this mythical place may simply be a convention to show that a magically distant chthonic land of myth was intended in the remote past. Before Persephone was abducted by Hades, the shepherd Eumolpus and the swineherd Eubuleus saw a girl in a black chariot driven by an invisible driver being carried off into the earth which had violently opened up. Eubuleus was feeding his pigs at the opening to the underworld when Persephone was abducted by Plouton. His swine were swallowed by the earth along with her, and the myth is an etiology for the relation of pigs with the ancient rites in Thesmophoria, and in Eleusis.\n\nIn the hymn, Persephone returns and she is reunited with her mother near Eleusis. Demeter as she has been promised established her mysteries (orgies) when the Eleusinians built for her a temple near the spring of Callichorus. These were awful mysteries which were not allowed to be uttered. The uninitiated would spend a miserable existence in the gloomy space of Hades after death.\n\nIn some versions, Ascalaphus informed the other deities that Persephone had eaten the pomegranate seeds. When Demeter and her daughter were reunited, the Earth flourished with vegetation and color, but for some months each year, when Persephone returned to the underworld, the earth once again became a barren realm. This is an origin story to explain the seasons.\n\nIn an earlier version, Hecate rescued Persephone. On an Attic red-figured bell krater of c. 440 BC in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Persephone is rising as if up stairs from a cleft in the earth, while Hermes stands aside; Hecate, holding two torches, looks back as she leads her to the enthroned Demeter.\n\nThe 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia \"Suda\" introduces a goddess of a blessed afterlife assured to Orphic mystery initiates. This Macaria is asserted to be the daughter of Hades, but no mother is mentioned.\n\nIn the myth Pluto abducts Persephone to be his wife and the queen of his realm (this is the myth which explains their marriage). Pluto (Πλούτων, \"Ploutōn\") was a name for the ruler of the underworld; the god was also known as Hades, a name for the underworld itself. The name \"Pluton\" was conflated with that of Ploutos (Πλούτος \"Ploutos\", \"wealth\"), a god of wealth, because mineral wealth was found underground, and because Pluto as a chthonic god ruled the deep earth that contained the seeds necessary for a bountiful harvest. \"Plouton\" is lord of the dead, but as Persephone's husband he has serious claims to the powers of fertility.\n\nIn the Theogony of Hesiod, Demeter was united with the hero Iasion in Crete and she bore Ploutos. This union seems to be a reference to a hieros gamos (ritual copulation) to ensure the earth's fertility. This ritual copulation appears in Minoan Crete, in many Near Eastern agricultural societies, and also in the Anthesteria.\n\nNilsson believes that the original cult of Ploutos (or Pluto) in Eleusis was similar with the Minoan cult of the \"divine child\", who died in order to be reborn. The child was abandoned by his mother and then it was brought up by the powers of nature. Similar myths appear in the cults of Hyakinthos (Amyklai), Erichthonios (Athens), and later in the cult of Dionysos.\n\nThe Greek version of the abduction myth is related to grain – important and rare in the Greek environment – and the return (ascent) of Persephone was celebrated at the autumn sowing. Pluto (Ploutos) represents the wealth of the grain that was stored in underground silos or ceramic jars (\"pithoi\"), during summer months. Similar subterranean \"pithoi\" were used in ancient times for burials and Pluto is fused with Hades, the King of the realm of the dead. During summer months, the Greek \"grain-Maiden\" (Kore) is lying in the grain of the underground silos in the realm of Hades, and she is fused with Persephone, the Queen of the Underworld. At the beginning of the autumn, when the seeds of the old crop are laid on the fields, she ascends and is reunited with her mother Demeter, for at that time the old crop and the new meet each other. For the initiated, this union was the symbol of the eternity of human life that flows from the generations which spring from each other.\n\nThe primitive myths of isolated Arcadia seem to be related to the first Greek-speaking people who came from the north-east during the bronze age. Despoina (the mistress), the goddess of the Arcadian mysteries, is the daughter of Demeter and Poseidon \"Hippios\" (horse), who represents the river spirit of the underworld that appears as a horse as often happens in northern-European folklore. He pursues the mare-Demeter and from the union she bears the horse Arion and a daughter who originally had the form or the shape of a mare. The two goddesses were not clearly separated and they were closely connected with the springs and the animals. They were related with the god of rivers and springs; Poseidon and especially with Artemis, the Mistress of the Animals who was the first nymph. According to the Greek tradition a hunt-goddess preceded the harvest goddess. In Arcadia, Demeter and Persephone were often called \"Despoinai\" (Δέσποιναι, \"the mistresses\") in historical times. They are the two Great Goddesses of the Arcadian cults, and evidently they come from a more primitive religion. The Greek god Poseidon probably substituted the companion (\"Paredros\", Πάρεδρος) of the Minoan Great goddess\nin the Arcadian mysteries.\n\nPersephone held an ancient role as the dread queen of the Underworld, within which tradition it was forbidden to speak her name. This tradition comes from her conflation with the very old chthonic divinity Despoina (the mistress), whose real name could not be revealed to anyone except those initiated to her mysteries. As goddess of death she was also called a daughter of Zeus and Styx, the river that formed the boundary between Earth and the underworld. Homer describes her as the formidable, venerable majestic queen of the shades, who carries into effect the curses of men upon the souls of the dead, along with her husband Hades. In the reformulation of Greek mythology expressed in the \"Orphic Hymns\", Dionysus and Melinoe are separately called children of Zeus and Persephone. Groves sacred to her stood at the western extremity of the earth on the frontiers of the lower world, which itself was called \"house of Persephone\".\n\nHer central myth served as the context for the secret rites of regeneration at Eleusis, which promised immortality to initiates.\n\nPersephone was worshipped along with her mother Demeter and in the same mysteries. Her cults included agrarian magic, dancing, and rituals. The priests used special vessels and holy symbols, and the people participated with rhymes. In Eleusis there is evidence of sacred laws and other inscriptions.\n\nThe Cult of Demeter and the Maiden is found at Attica, in the main festivals Thesmophoria and Eleusinian mysteries and in a lot of local cults. These festivals were almost always celebrated at the autumn sowing, and at full-moon according to the Greek tradition. In some local cults the feasts were dedicated to Demeter.\n\nThesmophoria, were celebrated in Athens, and the festival was widely spread in Greece. This was a festival of secret women-only rituals connected with marriage customs and commemorated the third of the year, in the month Pyanepsion, when Kore was abducted and Demeter abstained from her role as goddess of harvest and growth. The ceremony involved sinking sacrifices into the earth by night and retrieving the decaying remains of pigs that had been placed in the \"megara\" of Demeter (trenches and pits or natural clefts in rock), the previous year. These were placed on altars, mixed with seeds, then planted. Pits rich in organic matter at Eleusis have been taken as evidence that the Thesmophoria was held there as well as in other demes of Attica. This agrarian magic was also used in the cult of the earth-goddesses potniai (mistresses) in the Cabeirian, and in Knidos.\n\nThe festival was celebrated over three days. The first was the \"way up\" to the sacred space, the second, the day of feasting when they ate pomegranate seeds and the third was a meat feast in celebration of Kalligeneia a goddess of beautiful birth. Zeus penetrated the mysteries as Zeus- Eubuleus which is an euphemistical name of Hades (Chthonios Zeus). In the original myth which is an etiology for the ancient rites, Eubuleus was a swineherd who was feeding his pigs at the opening to the underworld when Persephone was abducted by Plouton. His swine were swallowed by the earth along with her.\n\nThe Eleusinian mysteries was a festival celebrated at the autumn sowing in the city of Eleusis. Inscriptions refer to \"the Goddesses\" accompanied by the agricultural god Triptolemos (probably son of Ge and Oceanus), and \"the God and the Goddess\" (Persephone and Plouton) accompanied by Eubuleus who probably led the way back from the underworld. The myth was represented in a cycle with three phases: the \"descent\", the \"search\", and the \"ascent\", with contrasted emotions from sorrow to joy which roused the mystae to exultation. The main theme was the ascent of Persephone and the reunion with her mother Demeter. The festival activities included dancing, probably across the Rharian field, where according to the myth the first grain grew.\n\nAt the beginning of the feast, the priests filled two special vessels and poured them out, the one towards the west, and the other towards the east. The people looking both to the sky and the earth shouted in a magical rhyme \"rain and conceive\". In a ritual, a child was initiated from the hearth (the divine fire). It was the ritual of the \"divine child\" who originally was Ploutos. In the Homeric hymn the ritual is connected with the myth of the agricultural god Triptolemos The high point of the celebration was \"an ear of grain cut in silence\", which represented the force of the new life. The idea of immortality didn't exist in the mysteries at the beginning, but the initiated believed that they would have a better fate in the underworld. Death remained a reality, but at the same time a new beginning like the plant which grows from the buried seed. In the earliest depictions Persephone is an armless and legless deity, who grows out of the ground.\n\nLocal cults of Demeter and Kore existed in Greece, Asia Minor, Sicily, Magna Graecia, and Libya.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1934, Igor Stravinsky based his melodrama \"Perséphone\" on Persephone's story. In 1961, Frederick Ashton of the Royal Ballet appropriated Stravinsky's score, to choreograph a ballet starring Svetlana Beriosova as Persephone.\n\nPersephone also appears many times in popular culture. Featured in a variety of young adult novels such as \"Persephone\" by Kaitlin Bevis, \"Persephone's Orchard\" by Molly Ringle, \"The Goddess Test\" by Aimee Carter, \"The Goddess Letters\" by Carol Orlock, and \"Abandon\" by Meg Cabot, her story has also been treated by Suzanne Banay Santo in \"Persephone Under the Earth\" in the light of women's spirituality. Here Santo treats the mythic elements in terms of maternal sacrifice to the burgeoning sexuality of an adolescent daughter. Accompanied by the classic, sensual paintings of Frederic Lord Leighton and William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Santo portrays Persephone not as a victim but as a woman in quest of sexual depth and power, transcending the role of daughter, though ultimately returning to it as an awakened Queen.\n\n\n\n\n"}

To cause excitation, the light that strikes the semiconductor must have enough energy to raise electrons across the band gap, or to excite the impurities within the band gap. When a bias voltage and a load resistor are used in series with the semiconductor, a voltage drop across the load resistors can be measured when the change in electrical conductivity of the material varies the current through the circuit.\n\nClassic examples of photoconductive materials include :\n\nWhen a photoconductive material is connected as part of a circuit, it functions as a resistor whose resistance depends on the light intensity. In this context, the material is called a photoresistor (also called \"light-dependent resistor\" or \"photoconductor\"). The most common application of photoresistors is as photodetectors, i.e. devices that measure light intensity. Photoresistors are not the \"only\" type of photodetector—other types include charge-coupled devices (CCDs), photodiodes and phototransistors—but they are among the most common. Some photodetector applications in which photoresistors are often used include camera light meters, street lights, clock radios, infrared detectors, nanophotonic systems and low-dimensional photo-sensors devices.\n\nSome materials exhibit deterioration in photoconductivity upon exposure to illumination. One prominent example is hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in which a metastable reduction in photoconductivity is observable (see Staebler–Wronski effect). Other materials that were reported to exhibit negative photoconductivity include molybdenum disulfide, graphene, indium arsenide nanowires, and metal nanoparticles.\n\nIn 2016 it was demonstrated that in some photoconductive material a magnetic order can exist. One prominent example is CHNH(Mn:Pb)I. In this material a light induced magnetization melting was also demonstrated thus could be used in magneto optical devices and data storage.\n\n"}
{"id": "36726184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36726184", "title": "Planktivore", "text": "Planktivore\n\nA planktivore is an aquatic organism that feeds on planktonic food, including zooplankton and phytoplankton.\n\nPhytoplankton are usually photosynthetic one-celled plant organisms. These organisms are usually found near the surface of the water due to their need for light energy for their photosynthetic processes. Phytoplankton provide most of the oxygen that is in the water and provide a large amount of food for other organisms in the water column. \n\nZooplankton, in contrast, are heterotrophic plankton, animals which ingest nutrients rather than producing it via chemical reactions. Some taxa are planktonic for only part of their life cycle.\n\nPlanktivores ingest one or both types of plankton. \"Titanichthys\" was the first massive vertebrate pelagic planktivore, with a lifestyle similar to that of the modern basking, whale, or megamouth sharks. \n\nMost fish are planktivores during part or all of their life cycles, especially when they are larvae. There are obligate planktivores, which feed only on plankton, and facultative planktivores, which take plankton when available but eat other types of food as well. The gizzard shad (\"Dorosoma cepedianum\"), for example, has a voracious appetite for various forms of plankton across its life cycle. It is an obligate planktivore when it is a juvenile, in part due to its very small mouth size. As it grows it becomes an omnivore, taking phytoplankton, zooplankton, and larger pieces of nutritious detritus. Adult gizzard shad consume large volumes of zooplankton until it becomes scarce, then turn to organic debris for food.\n\nPlanktivores obtain food in two ways. Particulate feeders eat planktonic items selectively. Filter feeders process volumes of water and strain food items en masse. \"Tow-net\" filter feeders swim rapidly with mouths open to filter the water, and pumping filter feeders suck in water via pumping actions. The latter includes stationary animals, such as corals. Another form of filter feeding is a \"gulping\" behavior, in which the animal takes boluses of water; the alewife (\"Alosa pseudoharengus\") feeds in this manner.\n\nPlankton are among the lower trophic levels in food chains. Planktivores affect the food chain by altering the populations of plankton in various ways, a process known as the trophic cascade. The gizzard shad, again, plays this role. It consumes phytoplankton when it is small, zooplankton when it is larger, and other foods when it eliminates the zooplankton in the area. It incidentally controls the populations of other fish that depend on zooplankton, such as bluegill (\"Lepomis macrochiris\").\n\n"}

{"id": "28968720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28968720", "title": "Red Cross parcel", "text": "Red Cross parcel\n\nRed Cross parcel refers to packages containing mostly food, tobacco and personal hygiene items sent by the International Association of the Red Cross to prisoners of war during the First and Second World Wars, as well as at other times. It can also refer to medical parcels and so-called \"release parcels\" provided during World War II. The Red Cross arranged them in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention of 1929. During World War II these packages augmented the often-meager and deficient diets in the PoW camps, contributing greatly to prisoner survival and an increase in morale. Modern Red Cross food parcels provide basic food and sanitary needs for persons affected by natural disasters, wars, political upheavals or similar events.\n\nMore recent catastrophes involving delivery of Red Cross parcels include events in Georgia, Thailand and Great Britain.\n\nThe Australian Red Cross reported dispatching a total of 395,695 food parcels and 36,339 clothing parcels to Allied PoWs in Germany and Turkey during the course of World War I. Food parcels were also sent to desperate civilians in Belgium and France.\n\nBritish PoWs during World War I were supplied with food parcels by the British Central Prisoners of War Committee of the Joint War Organisation, the combined Red Cross and Order of St John. When the central powers refused to allow food to be sent to prisoners of war by the British government, the British Red Cross had stepped forward. Packages containing food and conveniences were sent fortnightly to PoW. Donations collected from the public for these parcels reached £674,908 19s 1d. A total of £5,145,458 16s 9d was spent. By the end of the war, some 9,000,000 food parcels and 800,000 clothing parcels had been despatched by various organisations to British prisoners abroad.\n\nFrench PoWs were required to pay for parcels sent to them through a French commission; these packages included potted chicken, various pâtés, and even bottled wine. Indigent French PoWs could receive parcels with lower-quality food for free, from the \"Vetement du Prisonnier\" which liaised actively with the Croix-Rouge Française.\n\nNew Zealand relatives had to buy parcels and were given a choice:\nA - 4 shillings\n\nB - 4 shillings\n\nC - 6 shillings\n\nD - For invalids - 6 shillings\nRelatives could send a specific parcel or one made up of A & C or B & C \n\nThe American Red Cross commenced delivery of food parcels to American PoWs in German camps in November 1917. The first parcel received by a PoW included the following items:\n\n\n\nThereafter, further parcels were sent once per week. These were rotated on a four-week schedule between packages labeled \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" and \"D\". Each parcel contained meat, fish, vegetable, bread and fruit items, together with eighty cigarettes or other tobacco products. Items of clothing were also provided for American PoWs through the American Red Cross. Toward the end of the war, German camp guards and other personnel would sometimes steal the contents of these packages, often leaving only bread for the helpless prisoner. In such events, American camp representatives attempted to make up the loss through stores kept for this purpose in the PoW camps.\n\nA special agreement between the YMCA and the American Red Cross resulted in the YMCA providing athletic equipment, books and games for American prisoners in German PoW camps.\n\nRed Cross food parcels during World War II were mostly provided from Great Britain, the United States (after 1941) and Canada. An Allied PoW might receive any of these packages at any one given time, regardless of his or her own nationality. This was because all such packages were sent from their country of origin to central collection points, where they were subsequently distributed to Axis PoW camps by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nFor PoWs held by Axis forces in Europe the parcel route through Lisbon required escorted ships to bring the crates of parcels, or for British, mail bags full of parcels, to Lisbon, there being no safe conduct agreement. In Portugal, parcels would be loaded onto Red Cross marked ships with many taken through the port of Marseilles, for onward freighting by rail to Geneva, from where they would be sent to various camps by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Barcelona was also used as an Iberian transit port, with Toulon as an alternative French port. The returning ships sometimes carried allied civilians and wounded being repatriated.\n\nThe route from Iberia to the South of France was not safe. The Red Cross ship SS Padua was damaged by British bombing in Genoa in 1942 and then sunk by a mine outside Marseilles in October 1943. The SS Embla was bombed by British aircraft on 6 April 1944 causing a fire, and the same ship was attacked again on 20 April 1944, by American B-26 bombers, who this time sank the ship and killed the ICRC agent. On 6 May the \"Christina\" was attacked while at anchor in Sete. This latest act resulted in the ICRC suspending the route. The Operation Dragoon invasion of Southern France, preliminary bombing in July and the actual invasion in August 1944 put a stop to rail transport and then Marseilles being used by the Red Cross. The SS Vega sailed to the alternative port of Toulon with parcels in November 1944.\n\nOn 8 May 1945 it was reported that 7,000,000 parcels, weighing 35,000 tons were at sea or in warehouses in Britain, Lisbon, Barcelona, Marseilles, Toulon, Geneva and Gothenburg. A Red Cross representative said that they were not perishable and could be used for distressed civilians and as a flexible reserve.\n\nDuring World War II, The British Joint War Organisation sent standard food parcels, invalid food parcels, medical supplies, educational books and recreational materials to prisoners of war worldwide. During the conflict, over 20 million standard food parcels were sent. Typical contents of such a parcel included:\n\n\nThe Scottish Red Cross parcels were the only ones to contain rolled oats. Approximately 163,000 parcels were made up each week during World War II.\n\nSometimes, due to the shortage of parcels, two or even four prisoners would be compelled to share the contents of one Red Cross parcel.\n\nThe American Red Cross produced 27,000,000 parcels. Even before America entered the war, they were supplying, through Geneva, parcels to British, Belgian, French, Polish, Yugoslav, Netherlands, Greek, Norwegian, and Russian prisoners of war. The Philadelphia centre alone was producing 100,000 parcels a month in 1942. A list of the contents of a typical Red Cross parcel received by an American airman held prisoner in Stalag Luft I near Barth, Germany on the Baltic Sea:\n\n\nAccording to this airman, recipients of these parcels were permitted to keep only the cigarettes and chocolate bars; the remainder of the parcel was turned over to the camp cook, who combined them with the contents of other parcels and German PoW rations (usually bread, barley, potatoes, cabbage and horse meat) to create daily meals for the prisoners.\n\nCigarettes in the parcels became the preferred medium of exchange within the camp, with each individual cigarette valued at 27 cents within Stalag Luft I. Similar practices were followed in other PoW camps, as well. Cigarettes were also used to bribe German guards to provide the prisoners with outside items that would otherwise have been unavailable to them. Tins of coffee, which were hard to come by in Germany late in the war, served this same purpose in many camps. Contents of these packages were sometimes pilfered by German guards or other camp personnel, especially toward the end of the war.\n\nThe Canadian Red Cross reported assembling and shipping nearly 16,500,000 food parcels during the Second World War, at a cost of $47,529,000. The Canadian Red Cross Prisoners of War Parcels Committee was led by Chairman Harold H. Leather, M.B.E., of Hamilton, Ontario and Vice Chairman John Draper Perrin of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Contents of the Canadian parcel included:\n\n\nParcels did vary; those delivered to the Channel Islands by the SS Vega in 1945 contained slightly different quantities, both raisins and prunes, and marmalade instead of jam.\n\nThe New Zealand Red Cross Society provided 1,139,624 parcels during the war period, packed by 1,500 volunteers. Prisoners parcels included:\n\nUnlike the American and British parcels, Canadian and New Zealand Red Cross parcels did not include cigarettes or tobacco.\n\nIndian parcels, supplied by the Indian Red Cross Society contained:\n\nIndian parcels did not contain meat or tobacco products.\n\nThe Argentinian Red Cross provided parcels containing:\n\n\nFrom the British South African Red Cross.\n\nParcels specifically designed for invalids, the contents may vary, but what appears to be a British one contained:\n\n\nIn 1942 permission for a Red Cross ship having been refused, permission was granted by Japan for a Diplomatic Neutral ship to be utilised for this purpose. A Swedish vessel, the MS Gripsholm delivered 20,000 Red Cross parcels from Canada, America and South Africa and in addition a consignment of 1,000,0000 cigarettes. A second voyage was refused.\n\nThe Japanese government in August 1942 announced that no neutral ship, even a Red Cross ship, would be allowed to enter Japanese waters. Red Cross parcels intended for Allied PoWs in Japan were accordingly stockpiled in Vladivostok, Russia, and a single ship was ultimately permitted to transport some of these to Japan in November 1944, which, in turn were carried by Japanese vessel Awa Maru, carrying Red Cross markings, in March, 1945, to Singapore. How many of these actually reached the PoWs is not known, and the sinking of the Awa Maru on the return trip by a US submarine prevented any future shipments from being made.\n\nAt the Changi prison camp run by the Japanese in Singapore, on average, a POW received a fraction of one food parcel in the three-and-a half years that the camp was open.\n\nIn November 1943, the Red Cross received permission from Nazi German authorities to send Red Cross parcels to inmates of concentration camps, but only to those whose names and specific locations were known. By May 1945, 105,000 specific individuals had been identified. About 1,112,000 parcels containing 4,500 tons of food were ultimately sent to the camps, including those at Dachau, Buchenwald, Ravensbrück, Sachsenhausen, Theresienstadt and Auschwitz. In addition to food, these parcels also contained clothing and pharmaceutical items.\n\nThree months after the German surrender in May 1945, General Dwight Eisenhower issued an order classifying all surrendered soldiers within the American Zone of Occupation as Disarmed Enemy Forces, rather than Prisoners of War. Accordingly, the Red Cross was denied the right to visit German PoWs in American prison camps, and delivery of Red Cross parcels to them was forbidden. In the spring of 1946 the International Red Cross was finally allowed to provide limited amounts of food aid to prisoners of war in the U.S. occupation zone.\n\nThe Canadian government conducted a detailed study of the effect of the Red Cross parcels on the health and morale of Canadian PoWs shortly after the end of World War II. Over 5,000 former PoWs were interviewed, and Canadian authorities determined that a significant number of soldiers did not get the intended one parcel per man per week; most had to make do with one-half of a parcel per week, or even less on some occasions. Soldiers were asked to state their preferences with regard to specific contents of the parcels: the most popular item turned out to be the biscuits, with butter a close second, followed (in order) by meat, milk (powdered and other), chocolate, cigarettes, tea, jam, cereals, cheese and coffee. The Canadian parcel was preferred to British, American or New Zealand-issued parcels, claiming that the Canadian parcels had \"greater bulk\", \"lasted longer\", and/or had \"more food\".\n\nWith regard to especially disliked foods, the Canadian respondents (over 4,200 of the interviewed PoWs) expressed the greatest distaste for the vegetables and fish enclosed in the food parcels (about fifteen percent of the total number of respondents), followed (in order) by condiments, egg powder, cereals, fat, cheese, desserts, sweets, beverages, jams, biscuits and milk. However, except for the first two items on that list, all of these were named by only a minuscule percentage of the total number of respondents.\n\n\nA second type of parcel delivered through the Red Cross during World War II was the Red Cross Prisoner of War First Aid Safety Kit, which was supplied by the American Red Cross for distribution through the International Committee. Such parcels generally held the following items:\n\n\nOther kits issued to some PoWs through the American Red Cross contained a few differences in contents, but were still generally similar to the above.\n\nThe British Red Cross also supplied Medical Parcels to Allied PoWs during the war. Prior to 15 June 1942 these kits generally consisted of:\n\n\nAfter 15 June 1942 the British kits were changed. The new kits contained:\n\n\nIn addition, German and Italian authorities sometimes permitted British prisoner hospitals to procure equipment from England via the Red Cross, including microscopes, sterilizers, material for manufacturing artificial limbs, medical instruments, vaccines, drugs and even games and other recreational materials.\n\nThe American Red Cross provided a special \"release parcel\" to some Allied PoWs upon their initial release from enemy captivity. These parcels included:\n\n\n\n\nThese kits were distributed as follows: 71,400 to France; 10,000 to the Soviet Union; 9,500 to Italy; 5,000 to Egypt; and 4,000 to the Philippines.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the former Soviet Union, many pensioners in the newly independent Republic of Georgia were left destitute by the resulting collapse of the Georgian economy and the inability of their meager pensions to keep up with inflation. The Red Cross, with the financial support of the German government, assisted approximately 500,000 of these mostly elderly people with food parcels over a seven-year period during the 1990s. , more than 12,000 were still dependent upon Red Cross food assistance.\n\nFood parcels were also distributed by the Red Cross of Thailand during the Red Shirt Movement disturbances in Bangkok, and to British victims of flooding in Gloucestershire in 2007. The British package contained:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10001982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10001982", "title": "Robert Gibbings", "text": "Robert Gibbings\n\nRobert John Gibbings (23 March 1889 – 19 January 1958) was an Irish artist and author who was most noted for his work as a wood engraver and sculptor, and for his books on travel and natural history. Along with Noel Rooke he was one of the founder members of the Society of Wood Engravers in 1920, and was a major influence in the revival of wood engraving in the twentieth century.\n\nGibbings was born in Cork into a middle-class family. His father, the Reverend Edward Gibbings, was a Church of Ireland minister. His mother, Caroline, was the daughter of Robert Day, Fellow of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland and president of The Cork Historical and Archaeological Society. He grew up in the town of Kinsale where his father was the rector of St. Multose Church.\n\nHe studied medicine for three years at University College Cork before deciding to persuade his parents to allow him to take up art. He studied under the painter Harry Scully in Cork and later at the Slade School of Art and the Central School of Art and Design.\n\nDuring the First World War he served in the Royal Munster Fusiliers and was wounded at Gallipoli in the Dardanelles, was invalided out and resumed his studies in London.\n\nIn 1919 he married Moira Pennefather, daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Edward Graham Pennefather from Tipperary, with whom he had four children, Patrick (1920), Brigid (1923) and Lawrence and Finnbar (1927).\n\nGibbings's early contact with Noel Rooke at the Central School set the course of the rest of his artistic career when he asked Rooke: \"Is it very foolish of me to try to be an artist?\" and received the reply: \"What else could you do?\". Life as an artist meant life as a wood engraver, and a life where Gibbings often struggled financially whilst, at the same time, receiving critical acclaim.\n\nThis was the case at this stage of his life. The critical acclaim came with an article in the \"Studio\" in February 1919, which reproduced a number of engravings, including two colour wood engravings. Commissioned work was more of a problem. Joseph Thorp obtained commercial commissions for Eno's Fruit Salts, Matinée cigarettes and Findlater's Port. For the London Underground he produced a poster for Wisley and a publicity booklet for London Zoo (1922), now considered to be the first of his published works, and the rarest.\n\nIn 1922 Gibbings produced a wood engraving for the dust jacket of \"The Oppidan\" by Shane Leslie and in 1923 he illustrated \"Erewhon\" by Samuel Butler.\n\nHe was very much at the centre of developments in wood engraving. He was a founder member and leading light of the Society of Wood Engravers, which he set up with Noel Rooke in 1920. In 1922 he contributed two wood engravings to \"Contemporary English Woodcuts\", an anthology of wood engravings produced by Thomas Balston, a director at Duckworth and an enthusiast for the new style of wood engravings. Campbell Dodgson, Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, wrote about him in his introduction to the book: \"The 'Cubist' or 'Post-Impressionist' element is represented by Mr. Gibbings\". The two engravings by Gibbings were 'Clear Waters', a strikingly modern nude, and 'Hamrun', both examples of his 'vanishing line' technique.\n\nIn 1923 Gibbings received a commission for a set of wood engravings for \"The Lives of Gallant Ladies\" for the Golden Cockerel Press, his most important commission to date at 100 guineas.\n\nGibbings was working on the wood engravings \"The Lives of Gallant Ladies\" when Hal Taylor, the owner of the press, became very ill with tuberculosis and had to put it up for sale. He sought a loan from a friend, Hubert Pike, a director of Bentley Motors, to buy the press. He took over in February 1924, paying £850 for the huts housing the business, the plant and goodwill. For the partially completed \"Gallant Ladies\" a further sum of £200 was paid. He also leased the house and land for £40 per annum. \"Gallant Ladies\" sold well with receipts of over £1,800, and saw the start of a golden period for the press and Gibbings and his family.\n\nThe printing staff – Frank Young, Albert Cooper and Harry Gibbs – were skilled and capable of very fine work. Moira Gibbings helped her husband in the business, and Gibbings kept close links with A.E. Coppard, who had helped Taylor with the business side of the press and who was to become a close friend. Gibbings knew all the leading wood engravers of the day and a number of authors, which enabled him to publish modern texts as well as classic ones.\n\nThe first book for which Gibbings was entirely responsible was \"Moral Maxims\" by Rochefoucault (1924). Eric Gill was brought into the fold when he quarrelled with Hilary Pepler over the publication of Enid Clay's \"Sonnets and Verses\" (1925) and transferred the book to Gibbings. In 1925 he went on to commission engravings from John Nash, Noel Rooke, David Jones, John Farleigh and Mabel Annesley among others.\n\nGibbings published some 71 titles at the press and printed a number of books for others. The size of a run was normally between 250 and 750, and the books were mostly bound in leather by bookbinders Sangorski & Sutcliffe. The major titles were the four volume \"Canterbury Tales\" (1929 to 1931) and the \"Four Gospels\" (1931), both illustrated by Gill. Gibbings printed 15 copies of the \"Canterbury Tales\" on vellum, and 12 copies of the \"Four Gospels\". Printing the \"Canterbury Tales\" dominated work at the press for two and a half years, and relatively few other books were printed during that period. However, the book was a considerable critical and financial success and grossed £14,000. \"Four Gospels\" was equally successful, and sold out shortly after publication in November 1931.\n\nGibbings produced a number of books with his own wood engravings at the press, the highpoints being \"The True History of Lucian\" (1927) and \"Lamia\" by John Keats (1928).\n\nSales were strong during most of this period. Gibbings had established links with a number of booksellers, notably Bumpus in London, and negotiated a very favourable deal with Random House in the USA. He bought out Pike with finance from another Irish friend, Mary Wiggin, and later bought her out, borrowing the money from Barclays Bank.\n\nThe Gibbings family had moved to Waltham Saint Lawrence when they bought the press. Gibbings and Moira indulged in a rather unconventional and hedonistic lifestyle (neither had any inhibitions about nudity), and saw a good deal of Gill, with whom they had a very easy-going relationship. Gibbings never settled into family life, and this became an issue for Moira as time passed.\n\nAlthough much of his time was taken up by running the press, Gibbings did work for other publishers. He illustrated \"The Charm of Birds\" by Viscount Grey of Falloden (1927) for Hodder & Stoughton, and \"A Mirror for Witches\" by Esther Forbes (1928) for Houghton Mifflin. When he sent the blocks to Houghton he added in his letter: \"Next time you give me a job, for God's sake send me to the South Seas – I'm sick of English fogs\". They were so impressed by the success of this book that they commissioned Gibbings to illustrate with wood engravings a book set in Tahiti that would be written by James Norman Hall, the author of \"Mutiny on the Bounty\". Gibbings leapt at the chance and in 1929 he set out for Tahiti. He completed the wood engravings, but Hall did not complete the text. However, two books did emerge from this visit, \"The Seventh Man\" (1930), written, illustrated and published at the Golden Cockerel Press by Gibbings, and \"Iorana\" (1932), a semi-fictitious account by Gibbings of his time in Tahiti. Houghton published a bowdlerised version, and Duckworth the full version.\n\nIn February 1932 Gibbings wrote to the owners of the Orient Line suggesting that he produce wood engravings for their publicity in return for a free cruise. They agreed, and he produced \"XIV Engravings on Wood\" for them, one of which was also used as a poster.\n\nMoira was less than delighted that Gibbings had twice left her in charge of the business and their family on her own and with very little consultation. Lawrence had tuberculosis and she decided to leave for South Africa to join her mother, taking the three youngest children. She returned in 1936 to finalise her divorce from Gibbings.\n\nIn the early 1930s the business climate had changed, and, as American sales had faltered, Gibbings had struggled on as the depression became more severe. The press was now moribund and Gibbings eventually sold up in 1933. The last book that he produced was \"Lord Adrian\" by Lord Dunsany (1933), illustrated with his own wood engravings.\n\nGibbings had lost his livelihood and his family, though not his home. He did not sell the grounds and buildings of the press, as the new owners moved the press to London. To save money he moved out of the cottage into one of the huts in the grounds, and his son Patrick, who was at Saint Piran's Independent School in Maidenhead, stayed in another one when he was at home at the weekend. He did not seem deeply distressed about the loss of his family, although he did build up a close relationship with Patrick. The money from the sale of the press was enough to clear his debts, and a cloud seemed to lift. He wrote: \"But what peace of mind when, standing in the wooden hut to which I had moved, I could look about me and see not one thing that was worth five shillings to anyone else!\"\n\nIn 1934 he completed the two books that he considered to be his best, \"Beasts and Saints\" by Helen Waddell and \"Glory of Life\" by Llewelyn Powys. \"Glory of Life\" was produced by Gibbings, but published by the new owners of the Golden Cockerel Press.\n\nThis was the beginning of a sustained period as an author illustrator. In 1935 he produced \"A True Tale of Love in Tonga\", another picture book along the lines of \"The Seventh Man\", followed in 1936 by \"Coconut Island\", a book for children. Both of these were based on his experiences in the South Seas, and were followed by \"John Graham, Convict\" (1937), a version of a true account set in Australia.\n\nHis reputation was growing and he was commissioned by Penguin Books to write a travel book. He went to Bermuda and the Red Sea, and wrote and illustrated \"Blue Angels and Whales\" (1938). This was the first original writing commissioned by Penguin. The book led to Gibbings's appointment as art director of a new series of Penguin Illustrated Classics. The first ten titles, launched in May 1938, were illustrated by Gibbings (he illustrated Herman Melville's \"Typee\") and other wood engravers. The series was not a success and was discontinued after the issue of the first ten titles. Penguin did, however, publish \"Coconut Island\" in 1945 as a Puffin Story Book, as well as his wood engravings to books by Eleanor Doorly – \"The Insect Man\" (1942), \"The Microbe Man\" (1943) and \"The Radium Woman\" (1953).\n\nAs well as writing his own books, he continued to produce wood engravings for other commissions, such as George Scott-Moncrieff's \"A Book of Uncommon Prayer\" (1937) for Methuen, where each short poem such as \"The Cormorant\" faced one of his images. The cormorant prays \"Give me the green wave force, / Show me where / The sweetest fishes swim\". He continued to illustrate books for the Golden Cockerel Press and other publishers, designed a greetings telegram for the GPO, became involved with the Sun Bathing review and produced adverts for Shell Oil.\n\nThere were two major changes in his life. He had numbers of visitors from Reading University, one of whom was Elisabeth Empson. Early in 1934 she discovered that she was pregnant. This came as something of a shock to her parents. There was a twenty-year age difference between her and Gibbings, and he was unable to marry her as he was still married to Moira. The couple moved down to Cornwall, where their daughter Vahine was born in November 1934 – they had two more children, another daughter Tiare (1937) and Shaun (1946). Elisabeth's parents came to accept the relationship, and gave the couple the money to build a cottage in the grounds at Waltham Saint Lawrence in 1935. Elisabeth and Gibbings were married in 1937 after Moira finally agreed to a divorce. The relationship was always strained, for much the same reasons that Gibbings's relationship with Moira was strained. He went off, for example, on two trips to Bermuda and the Red Sea, leaving Elisabeth with two young children to look after.\n\nA more positive change in his life was his appointment in 1936 as sessional lecturer in typography, book production and illustration at Reading University for one day a week. He was a very good teacher, and encouraged his students by producing a number of books illustrated with their wood engravings, including \"Fatherless Oberlus\" (1936), \"Loftur\" (1939) and \"The Diary of W. Lashly\" (1939), the diary of William Lashly, a survivor of Captain Scott's expedition to the South Pole.\n\nIn 1940 Elisabeth and the two children were evacuated to Canada. They returned in summer 1945, a few weeks before Gibbings set off to the South Seas for well over a year.\n\nWhile Elisabeth was away Gibbings moved into Saint Patrick's Hall, an all-male hall of residence at the university, and settled into a bachelor life that he found very congenial. The teaching and the extra-curricular life were very much to his liking, and there was one factor that led him inexorably into this next phase of his artistic life.\n\nGibbings had begun to take part in natural history trips to the Thames organised by the university. He later wrote: \"In the early days of 1939 there arose in me a great desire to find peace beside a river\". Along with Patrick and two other helpers he built himself a boat, the \"Willow\", and floated down the Thames. The result was \"Sweet Thames Run Softly\" (1940). He took the title from Edmund Spenser's \"Prothalamion\": \"Sweete Themmes! runne softly, till I end my Song\". His observations and wood engravings of the countryside, the river and its natural history, were the fruits of gentle months spent on the Thames, accompanied by sketch pad and microscope. Written at a time of great insecurity, the book captivated readers, acutely aware that the world it portrayed was in imminent danger of being wiped out. Thomas Balston wrote of Gibbings: \"Few readers in these harassing days escape the longing for a simpler life, and Gibbings is very much a modern Thyrsis.\" He had captured a moment shared by many other people at the time, and over 140,000 copies of the book were printed.\n\n\"Coming down the Wye\" (1942) and \"Lovely is the Lee\" (1944) followed, based on the familiar pattern of personal encounter and anecdote, and historical and cultural research, all illustrated by his wood engravings. In August 1945 he set out for Polynesia again. He visited many of the islands and spent six months in New Zealand (including Dunedin and Napier), returning in late 1947. He recounted his travels and experiences in \"Over the Reefs\" (1948). He returned to Ireland for \"Sweet Cork of Thee\" (1951), and then crossed the English Channel to write \"Coming down the Seine\" (1953). \"Trumpets from Montparnasse\" (1955) was based on his travels in France and Italy. His final book, based on the area around Long Wittenham, was \"Till I end my Song\" (1957). The somewhat prophetic title is the second half of the couplet from Spenser's \"Prothalamion\" that begins: \"Sweet Thames run softly ...\".\n\nWriting his own books and producing the wood engravings for them kept him busy, but he did illustrate other books too, the most notable being an edition of \"The Voyage of the Beagle\" by Charles Darwin (1956).\n\nThe bearded figure of Gibbings became as familiar on British television as was his voice to radio listeners. David Attenborough remembers Gibbings as being one of the inspiring influences at the start of his career.\nGibbings's private life retained the turbulent nature that it had always had. Elisabeth came back to Waltham Saint Lawrence with the two girls in summer 1945, keen to have another child. Gibbings left for the South Seas after a very few weeks, leaving Elisabeth, who was by now pregnant, with their children. Their third child, Shaun, was born in April 1946. Gibbings's life at the time was complicated by his relationship with Patience Empson, Elisabeth's sister. The relationship had started when Patience typed up the manuscript for \"Coming Down the Wye\" and had since developed to the extent that she flew out to join him in Fiji in May 1946. She went mostly to help him with his writing, and partly at Elisabeth's suggestion. When Gibbings returned to England late in 1947 she stayed in New Zealand and then went to South Africa as Mrs. Empson felt that it would be improper for her to return with Gibbings. By April 1951 Elisabeth and Gibbings were divorced, and his relationship with Patience became more relaxed.\n\nIn September 1955 Patience and Gibbings bought Footbridge Cottage, a tiny beehive of a cottage in Gibbings's words, in Long Wittenham on the banks of the Thames. Life there suited Gibbings, and he had a period of tranquility that he had not known previously. They lived there until Gibbings died of cancer in hospital at Oxford on 19 January 1958. He is buried in the churchyard at Long Wittenham. The grave is marked by a simple headstone featuring his device of a crossed quill and graver, carved by Michael Black, a young sculptor who was a friend of Gibbings.\n\nGibbings dominates the period of the modern wood engraving revival in Britain, both by the longevity of his artistic career, and its significance. His is the most cited name in Joanna\nSelborne's monumental survey. He was at the centre of all the developments in wood engraving, from the cubist engravings of his vanishing line period to the traditional landscape based engravings of the river books. He ran the Golden Cockerel Press at the period when it shaped the concept of the wood engraved book.\n\nHe was gripped by the possibilities of wood engravings, by the possibilities of expression within the very formal constraints of the medium: \"But slowly a love of the wood came upon me. I began to enjoy the crisp purr of the graver as it furrowed the polished surface. I began to appreciate the cleanness of the white line that it incised: even the simplest silhouettes had an austere quality, a dignity, that could not be achieved by other means. Clear, precise statement, that was what it amounted to. Near enough wouldn't do: it had to be just right\".\n\nThe definitive biography of Gibbings is by Martin Andrews, and the definitive bibliography is by Mary Kirkus. There is an article on his bookplate production in the \"Bookplate Journal\", and one on his working library in the \"Private Library\". There are a number of relevant articles in \"Matrix 9\".\n\nThere are two collections of his wood engravings, the first by Thomas Balston, the second, more definitive collection by Patience Empson.\n\nThe main collection of his work in Great Britain is held by Reading University.\n\nA significant number of Gibbings’ original wood engravings are also held at St Bride Library\n"}

{"id": "28861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28861", "title": "Serengeti", "text": "Serengeti\n\nThe Serengeti () ecosystem is a geographical region in Africa. It is located in northern Tanzania. It spans approximately . \n\nThe Serengeti hosts the second largest terrestrial mammal migration in the world, which helps secure it as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa, and as one of the ten natural travel wonders of the world. The Serengeti is also renowned for its large lion population and is one of the best places to observe prides in their natural environment. The region contains the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania and several game reserves.\n\nApproximately 70 large mammal and 500 bird species are found there. This high diversity is a function of diverse habitats, including riverine forests, swamps, kopjes, grasslands, and woodlands. Blue wildebeests, gazelles, zebras, and buffalos are some of the commonly found large mammals in the region.\n\nThere has been controversy about a proposed road to be built through the Serengeti.\n\nSerengeti is derived from the Maasai language, Maa; specifically, \"Serengit\" meaning \"Endless Plains\".\n\nMuch of the Serengeti was known to outsiders as Maasailand. The Maasai are known as fierce warriors and live alongside most wild animals with an aversion to eating game and birds, subsisting exclusively on their cattle. Historically, their strength and reputation kept the newly arrived Europeans from exploiting the animals and resources of most of their land. A rinderpest epidemic and drought during the 1890s greatly reduced the numbers of both Maasai and animal populations. The Tanzanian government later in the 20th century re-settled the Maasai around the Ngorongoro Crater. Poaching and the absence of fires, which had been the result of human activity, set the stage for the development of dense woodlands and thickets over the next 30–50 years. Tsetse fly populations now prevented any significant human settlement in the area.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, wildebeest and the Cape buffalo populations had recovered and were increasingly cropping the grass, reducing the amount of fuel available for fires. The reduced intensity of fires has allowed acacia to once again become established.\n\nIn the 21st century, mass rabies vaccination programmes for domestic dogs in the Serengeti have not only indirectly prevented hundreds of human deaths, but also protected wildlife species such as the endangered African wild dog.\n\nEach year around the same time, the circular great wildebeest migration begins in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area of the southern Serengeti in Tanzania and loops in a clockwise direction through the Serengeti National Park and north towards the Masai Mara reserve in Kenya. This migration is a natural phenomenon determined by the availability of grazing. The initial phase lasts from approximately January to March, when the calving season begins – a time when there is plenty of rain-ripened grass available for the 260,000 zebra that precede 1.7 million wildebeest and the following hundreds of thousands of other plains game, including around 470,000 gazelles.\n\nDuring February, the wildebeest spend their time on the short grass plains of the southeastern part of the ecosystem, grazing and giving birth to approximately 500,000 calves within a 2 to 3-week period. Few calves are born ahead of time and of these, hardly any survive. The main reason is that very young calves are more noticeable to predators when mixed with older calves from the previous year. As the rains end in May, the animals start moving northwest into the areas around the Grumeti River, where they typically remain until late June. The crossings of the Grumeti and Mara rivers beginning in July are a popular safari attraction because crocodiles are lying in wait. The herds arrive in Kenya in late July / August, where they stay for the remainder of the dry season, except that the Thomson's and Grant's gazelles move only east/west. In early November, with the start of the short rains the migration starts moving south again, to the short grass plains of the southeast, usually arriving in December in plenty of time for calving in February.\n\nAbout 250,000 wildebeest die during the journey from Tanzania to the Maasai Mara National Reserve in southwestern Kenya, a total of . Death is usually from thirst, hunger, exhaustion, or predation.\n\nThe Serengeti has some of East Africa's finest game areas. Besides being known for the great migration, the Serengeti is also famous for its abundant large predators. The ecosystem is home to over 3,000 lions (\"Panthera leo\"), 1,000 leopards (\"Panthera pardus\"), and 7,700 to 8,700 spotted hyenas (\"Crocuta crocuta).\".The East African cheetah are also present in Serengeti.\n\nWild dogs are relatively scarce in much of the Serengeti. This is particularly true in places such as Serengeti National Park (where they became extinct in 1992), in which lions and spotted hyenas, predators that steal wild dog kills and are a direct cause of wild dog mortality, are abundant.\n\nThe Serengeti is also home to a diversity of grazers, including African buffalo, warthogs, Grant's gazelle, eland, waterbuck, and topi. The Serengeti can support this remarkable variety of grazers only because each species, even those that are closely related, has a different diet. For example, wildebeests prefer to consume shorter grasses, while zebras prefer taller ones. Similarly, dik-diks eat the lowest leaves of a tree, impalas eat the leaves that are higher up, and giraffes eat leaves that are even higher.\n\nThe governments of Tanzania and Kenya maintain a number of protected areas, including national parks, conservation areas, and game reserves, that give legal protection to over 80 percent of the Serengeti.\n\nThe southeastern area lies in the rain shadow of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area's highlands and is composed of shortgrass treeless plains with abundant small dicots. Soils are high in nutrients, overlying a shallow calcareous hardpan due to natrocarbonatite eruptions from Ol Doinyo Lengai. A gradient of soil depth northwestward across the plains results in changes in the herbaceous community and taller grass. About west, acacia woodlands appear suddenly and stretch west to Lake Victoria and north to the Loita Plains, north of the Maasai Mara National Reserve. The sixteen acacia species vary over this range, their distribution determined by edaphic conditions. Near Lake Victoria, floodplains have developed from ancient lakebeds.\n\nIn the far northwest, acacia woodlands are replaced by broadleaved Terminalia-Combretum woodlands, caused by a change in geology. This area has the highest rainfall in the system and forms a refuge for the migrating ungulates at the end of the dry season.\n\nAltitudes in the Serengeti range from with mean temperatures varying from . Although the climate is usually warm and dry, rainfall occurs in two rainy seasons: March to May, and a shorter season in October and November. Rainfall amounts vary from a low of in the lee of the Ngorongoro highlands to a high of on the shores of Lake Victoria. The highlands, which are considerably cooler than the plains and are covered by montane forest, mark the eastern border of the basin in which the Serengeti lies.\n\nThe Serengeti plain is punctuated by granite and gneiss outcroppings known as kopjes. These outcroppings are the result of volcanic activity. Kopjes provide a microhabitat for non-plains wildlife. One kopje likely to be seen by visitors to the Serengeti is the Simba Kopje (Lion Kopje).\n\nThe area is also home to the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, which contains Ngorongoro Crater and the Olduvai Gorge, where some of the oldest hominin fossils have been found.\n\n\n"}

This idea has been related to memetics. The idea of the sociofact was developed extensively by David Bidney in his textbook \"Theoretical Anthropology\". Bidney used the term to refer to objects which consist of interactions between members of a social group. The concept has been used by philosophers and social scientists in their analyses of varying kinds of social groups. For instance, semiotician of music Charles Boilès, in a discussion of the semiotics of the tune \"Taps\", claims that although it is a single piece of music, it can be seen as three distinct musical sociofacts: as a \"last call\" signal in taverns frequented by soldiers, as an \"end of day\" signal on military bases, and hence symbolically as a component of military funerals. The claim has been made that sociofactual analysis can play a decisive role for the performance of, and collaboration within, organizations.\n"}
{"id": "15192453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15192453", "title": "Stress fiber", "text": "Stress fiber\n\nStress fibers are contractile actin bundles found in non-muscle cells. They are composed of actin (microfilaments) and non-muscle myosin II (NMMII), and also contain various crosslinking proteins, such as α-actinin, to form a highly regulated actomyosin structure within non-muscle cells. Stress fibers have been shown to play an important role in cellular contractility, providing force for a number of functions such as cell adhesion, migration and morphogenesis.\n\nStress fibers are primarily composed of actin and myosin. Actin is a ~43kDa globular protein, and can polymerize to form long filamentous structures.These filaments are made of two strands of actin monomers (or protofilaments) wrapping around each other, to create a single actin filament. Because actin monomers are not symmetrical molecules, their filaments have polarity based upon the structure of the actin monomer, which will allow one end of the actin filament to polymerize faster than the other. The end that can polymerize faster is known as the plus-end, whereas the end that polymerizes slower is known as the minus-end. Stress fibers are usually composed of 10-30 actin filaments. Stress fibers are composed of antiparallel microfilaments: actin filaments are bundled along their length, and plus-ends and minus-ends co-mingle at each end of the bundle. The antiparallel arrangement of actin filaments within stress fibers is reinforced by α-actinin, an actin filament crosslinking protein which contains antiparallel actin-binding domains. These bundles are then cross-linked by NMMII to form stress fibers.\n\nThe Rho family of GTPases regulate many aspects of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, including stress fiber formation. RhoA (sometimes referred to as just 'Rho') is responsible for the formation of stress fibers, and its activity in stress fiber formation was first discovered by Ridley and Hall in 1992. When bound to GTP, Rho activates Rho-associated coiled-coil forming kinase (ROCK) and mammalian homologue of Drosophila diaphanous (mDia). mDia is a formin, which nucleates and polymerizes long actin filaments. ROCK is a kinase that acts to phosphorylate MLCP (myosin-light-chain phosphatase), as well as the NMMII light chain, which inactivates MLCP and activates myosin. This will lead to the accumulation of activated myosin motor proteins, which bind the actin filaments that were polymerized by mDia, to create stress fibers. In addition, ROCK also phosphorylates and activates LIM-kinase. LIM-kinase will in turn phosphorylate and inactivate cofilin, which will prevent the breakdown and recycling of actin filaments, maintaining the integrity of the stress fibers.\n\nStress fibers play the following roles in cellular functioning:\n\nStress fibers are necessary for the formation and maintenance of cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion, such as the formation of adherens junctions, tight junctions and focal adhesions.\n\nAdherens junctions are a type of cell-cell adhesion structure that is present in both motile and non-motile cells, which adhere cells together via the homophilic binding of cadherins and nexins. Stress fibers play an important role in the maintenance of cadherin-dependent and nexin-dependent cell-cell contacts, and the Rho-family GTPases have been found to regulate the structure and integrity of adherens junctions. α-catenin and β-catenin are integral components of adherens junctions, which bind together to produce cadherin-α-catenin-β-catenin complexes. Early studies showed that α-catenin could interact with actin filaments, leading to the belief that α-catenin links the actin cytoskeleton to adherens junctions. However it was later found that α-catenin can only bind F-actin when it is unbound by β-catenin and cadherin.\n\nRecently, α-catenin has been shown to associate with formins, EPLIN, and vinculin. EPLIN has been found to enhance the bundling and stabilization of actin filaments, and vinculin is involved in the linkage of adhesion molecules to the actin cytoskeleton. This may serve as a mechanism for how actin is recruited to adherens junctions.\n\nTight junctions, or zona occludens, are the most important cellular element for the formation of semi-permeable barriers within or between tissues. Tight junctions primarily consist of claudins and occludins, which are membrane proteins that form the cell-cell contact, as well as ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3, which link tight junctions to the actin cytoskeleton. However, tight junctions have not been found to be directly linked to stress fibers, like they are for focal adhesions and adherens junctions.\n\nFocal adhesions are macromolecular assemblies that are used to connect cells to the ECM. They consist of three functional layers: an ECM-associated integrin layer, a membrane associated force transduction layer, and an actin layer, which is made up of actin stress fibers. As the naming or their layers implies, focal adhesions play a large role in mechanotransduction and cell migration. Focal adhesions are usually connected to stress fibers—in fact, stress fiber contractility is necessary for focal adhesion maintenance.\n\nAn essential feature of many cells is their ability to migrate towards certain mechanical (Durotaxis) or chemical (Chemotaxis) stimuli. Cell migration takes place through the concerted action of three Rho family GTPases: Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. When GTP-bound, Rac will cause the formation of lamellipodia, and Cdc42 will cause the formation of filopodia, thus promoting cell migration. In the migrating cell, there are three main types of stress fibers: ventral stress fibers, transverse arcs, and dorsal stress fibers. Ventral stress fibers are associated with focal adhesions at both ends, are located on the ventral surface of the cell, and function in adhesion and contraction. Transverse arcs are not directly linked to focal adhesions, and typically flow from the leading edge of the cell, back towards the cell centre. Dorsal stress fibers are located at the trailing edge of the cell. They attach to focal adhesions on the ventral surface of the trailing edge, and extend dorsally, towards the cell centre to attach to transverse arcs. During cell migration, actin filaments within stress fibers will be recycled by a process of retrograde actin flow. The mechanism of dissolution of the focal adhesion itself is poorly understood.\n\nMorphogenesis, at the cellular level, can be defined as giving shape to, or defining the architecture of a cell. The assembly of the cytoskeleton, including the actin cytoskeleton, is the determining factor in specifying cellular morphogenesis and conferring shape to cells. The contractility of stress fibers within the cell will therefore help to determine cellular morphogenesis. For example, the circumferential contractile actin belts of adherens junctions contribute to cellular morphogenesis. As well, the dorsal stress fibers, transverse arcs and ventral stress fibers aid in the determination of cell morphology during cell migration. A more detailed explanation of cellular morphogenesis can be found here.\n\nBoth microfilaments and microtubules play major roles in mechanotransduction. In the actin cytoskeleton, mechanotransduction can occur at cell-ECM and cell-cell adhesions, through focal adhesions and adherens junctions, respectively. Transduction of forces from the outside to the inside of the cell can control the maturation or disassembly of adhesions, and initiate intracellular signalling cascades that can alter cellular behaviours, and cells are known to assemble stress fibers when they encounter mechanical stress. For example, cells that are grown on rigid substrates will show thick stress fibers, whereas the stress fibers seen in cells grown on softer substrates will be less pronounced. The mechanical force transmitted to focal adhesions by stress fibers can also alter the conformation of mechanosensitive focal adhesion proteins, such as p130Cas and talins, suggesting that stress fiber contractility may translate mechanical signals into biochemical cues. \nThere are also a small subset of focal adhesion-associated integrins that terminate in the perinuclear actin cap (at the top of the nucleus), and are anchored there by the LINC complex. These cap-associated focal adhesions have been established as major mediators in mechanosensing, and represent a direct pathway for the transduction of mechanical cues from focal adhesions to the nucleus.\n\nThe structure of stress fibers differs between motile and non-motile cells. Stress fibers in motile and non-motile cells are similar in that they both contain actin filaments which are cross-linked by α-actinin and myosin II, however the spatial orientation of individual actin filaments within the stress fiber differ between motile and non-motile cells. Stress fibers in the ventral region of motile cells show an overall shift in individual actin filament orientation along the longitudinal axis of the stress fiber, such that the plus-ends of filaments are always predominantly pointing towards focal adhesions. Stress fibers in the ventral regions of non-motile cells show a \"periodic\" polarity that is similar to the organization of the sarcomere.\n\nAs discussed above, Rho is responsible for the formation of stress fibers. Misregulation of the Rho family of GTPases is implicated in many diseases. Common clinical applications that target Rho GTPases can be found here.\n"}

Traffic waves travel backwards relative to the cars themselves. Relative to a fixed spot on the road the wave can move with, or against the traffic, or even be stationary (when the waves moves away from the traffic with exactly the same speed as the traffic). Traffic waves are a type of traffic jam. A deeper understanding of traffic waves is a goal of the physical study of traffic flow, in which traffic itself can often be seen using techniques similar to those used in fluid dynamics.\n\nIt has been said that by knowing how traffic waves are created, drivers can sometimes reduce their effects by increasing vehicle headways and reducing the use of brakes, ultimately alleviating traffic congestion for everyone in the area.\nHowever, in other models, increasing headway leads to diminishing the capacity of the travel lanes, increasing the congestion; however, disputed by acknowledging that similar principles apply to herding sheep through gates, and that in such a case, via human intervention, solitons are diminished simply by slapping \"stuck sheep\" and holding back aggressive sheep. In funnelling sheep through gates it can be determined how much intervention is needed to curb bottlenecks. Similar principles can be applied to human traffic streams, where, if each individual had the knowledge of final destination and complete route planning, then traversal along a route would be done so with the full knowledge that any abrupt change from any itinerary causes delays for those about to traverse the same route.\n\nThe earliest theoretical model of traffic shock waves was offered by Lighthill and Whitman in 1955. The following year Paul Richards independently published a similar model. Both papers were based on fluid dynamics and the model is known as the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1103359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1103359", "title": "Ultra-high vacuum", "text": "Ultra-high vacuum\n\nUltra-high vacuum (UHV) is the vacuum regime characterised by pressures lower than about 10 pascal or 100 nanopascals (10 mbar, ~10 torr). UHV conditions are created by pumping the gas out of a UHV chamber. At these low pressures the mean free path of a gas molecule is greater than approximately 40 km, so the gas is in free molecular flow, and gas molecules will collide with the chamber walls many times before colliding with each other. Almost all molecular interactions therefore take place on various surfaces in the chamber.\n\nUHV conditions are integral to scientific research. Surface science experiments often require a chemically clean sample surface with the absence of any unwanted adsorbates. Surface analysis tools such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and low energy ion scattering require UHV conditions for the transmission of electron or ion beams. For the same reason, beam pipes in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider are kept at UHV.\n\n\nMaintaining UHV conditions requires the use of unusual materials for equipment. Heating of the entire system above 100 °C for many hours (\"baking\") to remove water and other trace gases which adsorb on the surfaces of the chamber is required upon \"cycling\" the equipment to atmosphere. To save time, energy, and integrity of the UHV volume an \"interlock\" is often used. The interlock volume has one door or valve facing the UHV side of the volume, and another door against atmospheric pressure through which samples or workpieces are initially introduced. After sample introduction and assuring that the door against atmosphere is closed, the interlock volume is typically pumped down to a medium-high vacuum. In some cases the workpiece itself is baked out or otherwise pre-cleaned under this medium-high vacuum. The gateway to the UHV chamber is then opened, the workpiece transferred to the UHV by robotic means or by other contrivance if necessary, and the UHV valve re-closed. While the initial workpiece is being processed under UHV, a subsequent sample can be introduced into the interlock volume, pre-cleaned, and so-on and so-forth, saving much time. Although a \"puff\" of gas is generally released into the UHV system when the valve to the interlock volume is opened, the UHV system pumps can generally snatch this gas away before it has time to adsorb onto the UHV surfaces. In a system well designed with suitable interlocks, the UHV components seldom need bakeout and the UHV may improve over time even as workpieces are introduced and removed.\n\nMany common materials are used sparingly if at all due to high vapor pressure, high adsorptivity or absorptivity resulting in subsequent troublesome outgassing, or high permeability in the face of differential pressure (i.e.: \"through-gassing\"):\n\nTechnical limitations: \n\nUltra-high vacuum is necessary for many surface analytic techniques such as:\n\nUHV is necessary for these applications to reduce surface contamination, by reducing the number of molecules reaching the sample over a given time period. At 0.1 mPa (10 Torr), it only takes 1 second to cover a surface with a contaminant, so much lower pressures are needed for long experiments.\n\nUHV is also required for:\nand, while not compulsory, can prove beneficial in applications such as:\n\nTypically, UHV requires:\n\nOutgassing is a problem for UHV systems. Outgassing can occur from two sources: surfaces and bulk materials. Outgassing from bulk materials is minimized by selection of materials with low vapor pressures (such as glass, stainless steel, and ceramics) for everything inside the system. Materials which are not generally considered absorbent can outgas, including most plastics and some metals. For example, vessels lined with a highly gas-permeable material such as palladium (which is a high-capacity hydrogen sponge) create special outgassing problems.\n\nOutgassing from surfaces is a subtler problem. At extremely low pressures, more gas molecules are adsorbed on the walls than are floating in the chamber, so the total surface area inside a chamber is more important than its volume for reaching UHV. Water is a significant source of outgassing because a thin layer of water vapor rapidly adsorbs to everything whenever the chamber is opened to air. Water evaporates from surfaces too slowly to be fully removed at room temperature, but just fast enough to present a continuous level of background contamination. Removal of water and similar gases generally requires baking the UHV system at 200 to 400 °C while vacuum pumps are running. During chamber use, the walls of the chamber may be chilled using liquid nitrogen to reduce outgassing further.\n\nHydrogen and carbon monoxide are the most common background gases in a well-designed, well-baked UHV system. Both Hydrogen and CO diffuse out from the grain boundaries in stainless steel. Helium could diffuse through the steel and glass from the outside air, but this effect is usually negligible due to the low abundance of He in the atmosphere.\n\nThere is no single vacuum pump that can operate all the way from atmospheric pressure to ultra-high vacuum. Instead, a series of different pumps is used, according to the appropriate pressure range for each pump. Pumps commonly used to achieve UHV include:\n\nUHV pressures are measured with an ion gauge, either a hot filament or an inverted magnetron type.\n\nMetal seals, with knife edges on both sides cutting into a soft, copper gasket. This all-metal seal can maintain pressures down to 100 pPa (~10 Torr).\n\nMeasurement of high vacuum is done using a \"nonabsolute gauge\" that measures a pressure-related property of the vacuum, for example, its thermal conductivity. See, for example, Pacey. These gauges must be calibrated. The gauges capable of measuring the lowest pressures are magnetic gauges based upon the pressure dependence of the current in a spontaneous gas discharge in intersecting electric and magnetic fields.\n\nA UHV manipulator allows an object which is inside a vacuum chamber and under vacuum to be mechanically positioned. It may provide rotary\nmotion, linear motion, or a combination of both. The most complex devices give motion in three axes and rotations around two of those axes. To generate the mechanical movement inside the chamber, two basic mechanisms are commonly employed: a mechanical coupling through the vacuum wall (using a vacuum-tight seal around the coupling), or a magnetic coupling that transfers motion from air-side to vacuum-side. Various forms of motion control are available for manipulators, such as knobs, handwheels, motors, stepping motors, piezoelectric motors, and pneumatics.\n\nThe manipulator or sample holder may include features that allow additional control and testing of a sample, such as the ability to apply heat, cooling, voltage, or a magnetic field. Sample heating can be accomplished by electron bombardment or thermal radiation. For electron bombardment, the sample holder is equipped with a filament which emits electrons when biased at a high negative potential. The impact of the\nelectrons bombarding the sample at high energy causes it to heat. For thermal radiation, a filament is mounted close to the sample and resistively heated to high temperature. The infrared energy from the filament heats the sample.\n\n\n"}
