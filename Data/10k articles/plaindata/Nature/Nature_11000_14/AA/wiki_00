{"id": "52163976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52163976", "title": "Canadian Arctic tundra", "text": "Canadian Arctic tundra\n\nThe Canadian Arctic tundra is a biogeographic designation for Northern Canada's terrain generally lying north of the tree line or boreal forest, that corresponds with the Scandinavian Alpine tundra to the east and the Siberian Arctic tundra to the west inside the circumpolar tundra belt of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nCanada's northern territories encompass a total area of , 26% of the country's landmass that includes the Arctic coastal tundra, the Arctic Lowlands and the Innuitian Region in the High Arctic. Tundra terrain accounts for approximately in Yukon, the Northwest Territories, in Nunavut, north-eastern Manitoba, northern Ontario, northern Quebec, northern Labrador and the islands of the Arctic Archipelago, of which Baffin Island with is the largest.\n\nCanada's tundra is characterized by extreme climatic conditions with year-round frozen grounds, long and cold winters, a very short growing season and low precipitation rates.\n\nThe Canadian Arctic tundra is the traditional home of indigenous peoples, predominately Inuit, who for most of their settlement history occupied the coastal areas of Nunavut, Nunavik (northern Quebec), Nunatsiavut (northern Labrador), the Northwest Territories and formerly in Yukon. Population numbers remain very moderate for the entire region and as of 2006 around 50% of the inhabitants are of indigenous descent.\n\nChanging climate, recorded and documented over several decades has already caused noticeable regional environmental instability and threatened or endangered a number of species.\n\nTundra is predominant in:\n\nThe northern mainland terrains, the Arctic coastal tundra and the Arctic Lowlands connect with the Alaskan coastal plain to the west and adjoin the coastal tundra of Greenland to the east. Countless lakes, rivers, deltas, marine straits and an extensive, rugged coastline comprise this complex and interdependent patchwork of terrestrial and marine habitats.\n\nThe Arctic Archipelago is subdivided into three biogeographical regions with distinctive floral and faunal communities:\n\nThe Arctic Cordillera is a large, deeply dissected chain of mountain ranges extending along the northeastern flank of the Arctic Archipelago from Ellesmere Island to the north-easternmost part of the Labrador Peninsula in northern Labrador and northern Quebec. The range is characterized by high glaciated peaks and ice caps, that includes Northern Canada's highest point at Barbeau Peak, reaching . The high elevations of this ecoregion is a Polar desert as lower elevated plains are dominated by patches of lichen and moss.\n\nIt contains the northern edges of the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and much of the island plateaus, such as the Parry and Lancaster island plateaus. Extending over most of the archipelago, this is the coldest and driest part of Canada. Lichens and herbs dominate in dry tundra interspersed with wetland species.\n\nIt comprises areas on the mainland - the southern half of Nunavut and the Northwest territories and stretches down into Quebec, Hudson Bay, the Ungava Peninsula and includes the Aberdeen and Amundsen Plains. Dominant features are hills and plains, ponds and lakes that allow growth of low shrubs mixed with herbs, lichens, and cotton-grass. Stunted Krummholz trees grow along the major river valleys.\n\nFor almost a million square kilometres, the pattern of habitats in the Southern Arctic is the same: sprawling shrublands, wet sedge meadows, and cold, clear lakes. Superimposed on this pattern are the fascinating shapes and textures created by intense frost action in the soil.\n\nThe Southern Arctic is the region of transition from the treeless Arctic tundra to the conifer forests. dwarf birch and Arctic willow are among the common shrub species, along with heaths, herbaceous plants, and lichens. Where nutrients and moisture are available along the rivers and streams, scattered clumps of stunted spruce trees grow. Sedges and mosses thrive in the wetlands of the lowland areas of this ecoregion and provide nesting sites for birds. Vegetation is most dense in sheltered areas and depressions, where there is less wind and more moisture.\n\nCanada's long tree line is a spatially inconsistent structure. Often several alternating vegetation patches are found in a \"Vegetation Tension Zone\". The entire range greatly varies in width and widens markedly in the east, particularly in the region of the Hudson Bay. Local soil, elevation and drainage quality are influential factors for the growth of the transition, some scholars also pointed to \"differences in albedo and \"snow retention\" caused by the presence of certain coniferous trees\".\n\nNorthern Canada's present physiognomy formed beginning around 750 to 600 million years ago by the breakup and subsequent rifting of the supercontinent Rodinia. The subsequent geological sequence has since created a recent physiography that divides into the regions listed below.\n\n\nCanada's tundra runs more or less over all physiographic divisions except the Appalachian Orogen. As these formations are of deep tectonic nature they do not necessarily constitute the structure and material found on the surface, are observable elevated mountain ranges or orogenic belts. Large areas of the Canadian Shield - the ancient geological core of the North American continental plate are buried under sedimentary rocks of the Interior Platform. Repeated glaciations have had a profound impact on shaping land forms and determining drainage patterns.\n\nPermafrost, the dominant natural phenomenon of the tundra is of fundamental significance for this unique ecosystem, as it commands the tundra's climate, wild life, ecology, drainage and soils. Definition: \"Permafrost is soil, rock or sediment that is frozen for more than two consecutive years.\"\n\nRecognized classification for the Northern Hemisphere regions in which permafrost occurs, on approximately 25% of the land area ().\n\n\nIn the discontinuous and sporadic zones permafrost distribution is complex and patchy, and permafrost-free terrain is common. The depth of permafrost varies from less than one meter to more than . Patterned ground - large polygonal ground patterns and ice wedges caused by frost over a long period of time are common throughout the region except for areas of solid bedrock.\n\nThe Arctic Cordillera peaks at over , topped with extensive glaciers. There are nunataks, ice fields and deeply cut valleys, a rugged coastline with long winding fjords and large areas of exposed bedrock. Lowland soils consist of loose rocky, sandy, colluvial and morainal material.\n\nThe lowland plains of the western mainland Arctic are covered with Pleistocene materials and outcrops of Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments. East of the Prince of Wales and Somerset islands, Precambrian granite bedrock surfaces.\n\nThe Southern Arctic sits on Precambrian granitic bedrock outcrops, followed in the west by Cretaceous shales from the Great Bear Lake to the Firth River, Yukon. The undulating landscape has innumerable lakes, ponds and wetlands and stratified sediments up to long. Seasonally frozen top layers vary in depth as differences in moisture give rise to a variety of land forms and habitats.\n\nThe active top layer of most southern and central soil profiles is only seasonally frozen, contains water, gases and nutrients, its depth varies depending on material, vegetative cover and the local temperature. Permafrost acts \"through physical and chemical processes in the top layer which operate as thermal and hydrological gradients\". Soils of the southern terrain consist of various glacial deposits. Finely-textured marine sediments dominate the soils of the coastal regions.\n\nHarsh environmental and weather conditions, slow growth and decomposition, poor soils, sparse resources and nutrients, low variety of land forms favour highly adapted and migratory life forms. Diversity of species is only seasonal and habitat sustainability is usually confined to brief periods of appropriate conditions. Hundreds of species of flowering plants are documented. Yet these are organisms with a short life cycle that reproduce by budding and division rather than by interaction with insects. The mid-summer growing season with up to 24 hours of sun lasts for 50 to 60 days. The average precipitation is per season. The tundra classifies as a desert due to low precipitation rates, yet permafrost causes even lower degrees of drainage and evaporation and as a result the ground, lakes and glaciers hold large quantities of fresh water.\n\nProlonged periods without sun light, frozen ground and strong winds also prevent substantial tree growth. Lichen, uniquely adapted, and does not rely on roots and soil for growth is one of the most notable, widespread and enduring organisms of the tundra. A symbiotic life form with a photobiont (algae or cyanobacteria) living among the filaments of a fungus where it benefits from moisture, elementary nutrients and is protected from the environment. The photobiont's photosynthetic processes in turn generate organic carbon sugars that feed the fungus.\n\nMidsummer shade temperatures peak at on the continent beyond the Arctic Circle, and in winter the temperature drops below . In the Arctic Archipelago average midsummer temperatures are lower than . Differences between soil surface and air temperatures can be considerable and are largely influenced by direct insolation and wind velocity.\n\nDuring the Pleistocene, Beringia a land bridge existed (from 70,000 to 60,000 and 30,000 to 11,000 years ago) between Alaska and Siberia. This corridor offered an opportunity for the interchange of fauna between Asia and the Americas. At the same time, these land masses provided ice-free terrain for mammals on which they could settle and reproduce - called Wisconsin refuge.\n\nBeringia is also one of the main migration routes of paleo-humans into North America including the Paleo-Eskimo communities of Alaska, Greenland and the Canadian Arctic.\n\nThe flora of the Canadian Arctic is characterized by low species diversity, low endemism and high resistance towards introduced species, attributed to more recent glaciation, in comparison to other Arctic regions, such as the Siberian tundra. The southern edge of the Canadian Arctic tundra is met by an arboreal tree line - the \"Arctic forest tundra transition zone\".\n\nIn order to adapt to the extreme conditions of the Arctic, plants have:\nOn the northernmost area of the Canadian Arctic tundra, the Arctic Cordillera the features of a Polar desert dominate on the highlands and in the interior, covered in ice and snow or just exposed bare bedrock and little vegetation is found. Typically, only patches of moss, lichen, Arctic poppy (\"Papaver radicatum\") and cold-hardy vascular plants such as sedge and cotton grass are found.\n\nRecent records have identified around 400 species of vascular plants in the region, represented in 42 families and 141 genera of plants. Of the approximately 106 endemic vascular plant species of the region, 34 different species have been identified in central Northern Canada, 20 in the Hudson Bay - Labrador area and 28 on Ellesmere Island. Some endemic plants, such as the Yukon Whitlow-grass (\"Draba yukonensis\") and the Long's northern rockcress (\"Braya longyi\") have become endangered due to industrial activities. In a 2008 expedition to south-west Victoria Island 204 species of vascular plants were recorded and more than 800 species were identified for the region.\n\nOn the southern islands of the Arctic Archipelago patches of low-lying and dwarf versions of arctic deciduous and evergreen shrubs are identified. In certain regions - such as Nunavut, the Baffin Uplands and the Lancaster Plateaus - Arctic willow (\"Salix arctica\"), purple saxifrage (\"Saxifraga oppositifolia\") and Kobresia simpliciuscula are also common. Other species found include the northern Labrador tea, \"Vaccinium\" ssp., foxtail grass and Luzula multiflora. In the Southern Arctic tundra, shrubs are more regular, consisting of dwarf birch, Arctic willow, northern Labrador tea, Dryas spp., and Vaccinium ssp. In waterlogged areas, moss, willow and sedge cover is substantial.\n\nInvasive species, such as the Kentucky blue grass, orchids, Red fescue and flax proved to be unsuccessful. Some exceptions are the common dandelion (\"Taraxacum officinale\"), which since its introduction to the region has proliferated on beaches and shores and near newly opened roads on Baffin Island, Barley (\"Hordeum vulgare\"), shepherd's purse (\"Capsella bursa-pastoris\") and the opium poppy (\"Papaver somniferum\").\n\nDuring the brief Arctic summer, migratory birds - ducks, geese, shore birds, jaegers (skua), gulls, terns, songbirds, owls and others nest in the mosaic of habitats provided by the tundra. The snowy owl (\"Nyctea scandiaca\") and the common raven (\"Corvus corax\") live in the Arctic tundra year-round.\n\nMost recent mammal species have a greatly varied evolutionary history:\n\nNotable marine species include the narwhal (\"Monodon monoceros\"), the Greenland shark (\"Somniosus microcephalus\"), the walrus (\"Odobenus rosmarus\") and the ringed seal (\"Pusa hispida\").\n\nInsect species include the \"Bombus polaris\" and \"Bombus hyperboreus\" (Arctic bumblebees, the mosquito, the hoverfly and the black fly.\n\nInvasive species include the cabbage white butterfly (\"Pieris rapae\"), common starling (\"Sturnus vulgaris\") and the house sparrow (\"Passer domesticus\").\n\nThe Canadian Arctic tundra was first colonized by indigenous peoples, of which the Inuit today are descendants. In the late 17th century European colonization of the region began. French and British merchants arrived and subsequently settled in the Canadian Arctic and dominated the fur trade. In doing this, the merchants established trade centres which grew into small villages. Over the years, the villages grew but remained primitive and self-sufficient, dependent on local resources. In 2011, the north of Canada corresponding to the Canadian Arctic had a population of 107,265 people and a population density of 0.03 inhabitants per square kilometre.\n\nAccording to Natural Resources Canada (2001), the health status of Canadians living in the Arctic is significantly lower than that of the rest of the country. Life expectancy is low and infant mortality rates are high, especially in Nunavut. The health of the indigenous peoples in Northern Canada is much worse compared to non-Aboriginals in the same area. Many indigenous peoples in Canada’s North have a lower socioeconomic status that has significant implications for health and well-being. Suicide rates, lung cancer, drowning rates and the number of deaths by accident are high. Due to the self-sufficient lifestyle in the Arctic, a large amount of time is spent hunting, fishing and gathering other food sources, which makes motor vehicle accidents in hazardous terrain common.\n\nThe Canadian Arctic shows a decrease of snow coverage, glacier formation, permafrost and ice caps; increase in temperature; increase in precipitation; and, shrinking of lakes and wetlands over the past few decades. Additionally, gradual movement of the boreal forest – tundra transition zone in a northward direction is occurring and is expected to continue.\n\nDuring the last 20 to 50 years the Canadian Arctic has experienced as much as temperature increase per decade. Rising temperatures are most pronounced in Western Canada and Alaska during the winter, where temperatures have risen by during the last half century. In the northern Ellesmere Island region, the mean daily air temperature is merely above from June until August, however during August 2008 the daily maximum reached . A record of was achieved in the area. The local population has observed climate change of the Canadian Arctic, such as \"a significant thinning of sea- and freshwater ice, a shortening of the winter ice season, reduction in snow cover, changes in wildlife and plant species’ distribution, melting permafrost, and increased coastal erosion of some shorelines\"\n\nThe combination of rain and snow on the Arctic terrain has been damaging for plants. The water penetrates the protective layer of snow over plants and hence, the likelihood of the water freezing and forming crystals in the plant increases. At Old Crow, Yukon considerable lowering of water levels was observed and a significant increase in shrub cover, especially those belonging to the Salix genus. Researchers reported peak annual greenness increases of 0.49 to 0.79% per year in dwarf shrubs, mosses and lichens of the Northern Arctic. Peak annual greenness increases of 0.46 to 0.67% were recorded in the Southern Arctic, mainly attributed to an increase in sedges and erect dwarf shrubs.\n\nSatellite imaging of spring snow cover duration (number of days with snow depth >2 centimetres from February to July) has recorded, over the 1971 to 2008 period, on average decreases of 3.3 to 2.8 days of snow per decade in the Canadian Arctic. This earlier snow melt has led to decreases between 14% and 46% of snow cover extent in the Canadian Arctic. These decreases correspond to the 1967 to 2008 period from May to June. Additionally, Yukon glaciers have lost 22% of their surface area (a total loss of 2,541 ± 189 km) over the last 50 years, corresponding to a total mass loss of 406 ± 177 Gigatonnes (equivalent to 1.13 ± 0.49 millimeter of global sea level rise).\n\nRainfall in the Canadian Arctic has increased by more than 20% in the last decades. However, the degree of rainfall increase is subject to variation from one location to the next. For example, in Resolute, Nunavut in the period of 1948 to 2007, there was a 48% increase in rainfall recorded with an average of of rain per decade.\n\n\"The Government of Canada is committed to working with international partners to reach an ambitious global agreement this is anchored in science and leads the world towards a low-carbon, climate resilient economy.\"\n\nA publication of the U.S. National Park Service concludes that the native caribou will be affected by increasing climate change in the Canadian Arctic. Rising temperatures account for decreasing access opportunities to lichen, the caribou's primary food source in their winter harvest. While there is going to be an increase of dense shrubs, the species tends to avoid such plants due to the threat of wolf predation. It is expected the caribou will likely not choose to feed on these shrubs. In addition, the higher wind rates have already affected the caribou population, because increased wind rates causes snow to harden. Snow hardening makes it difficult for caribou to roam along their typical migration patterns and access to lichen buried in snow is more difficult.\n\nThe Arctic fox (\"Vulpes lagopus\") - a highly adapted species is one of the land-dwelling predators of the Arctic region. Its physiognomy fits with the greyish-white background patterns of the local tundra and mountain habitats. Thick fur, specialized ‘heat-retaining’ circulatory systems in their feet and an ability to lower their metabolic rate are traits that are rather disadvantageous in warmer non-polar habitats. Survival and successful reproduction in any other biome are unlikely.\n\nThe species is regarded a prime indicator of the overall health of the tundra, its sensitivity makes it an indicator species (an organisms whose presence, absence or abundance - among others - reflects the health, environmental conditions and integrity of a specific habitat). An IUCN study argues that persistent global warming is going to have severe consequences for the species' future.\n\nAs new plant species from the south invade the region large extents of former tundra habitat are going to be replaced by arboreal forest.\n\nCompetition with the resilient red fox (Vulpes vulpes), who is a superior hunter and known to prey on Arctic foxes.\n\nClimate change will lead to instabilities in the population sizes of lemmings, voles and other important prey species.\n\n\n"}

Observations of such events are quite rare; this was the second recorded using scientific astronomical instruments (after the 1972 Great Daylight Fireball) and the first recorded from two distant positions, which enabled the calculation of several of its orbital characteristics. The encounter with Earth significantly changed its orbit and, to a smaller extent, some of its physical properties (mass and structure of its outer layer).\n\nVisual observations were reported by three independent Czech observers: astronomer Petr Pravec, Pavel Klásek, and Lucie Bulíčková. According to their report, the event started at 03:27:16±3 UT and the observed bright meteor (fireball) moved from south to north. It left a track that was visible for 10 seconds.\n\nMost data about the encounter were acquired using photographic observations by cameras of the European Fireball Network. It was the first event of this type recorded by cameras from two distant locations, at Červená hora and Svratouch (both in the present-day Czech Republic), which enabled the calculation of the meteoroid's orbital characteristics by geometrical methods. Both were equipped with all-sky fisheye objectives.\n\nThe Červená hora image was especially valuable. It recorded the fireball's trajectory over approximately 110°, starting 51° above the southern horizon, passing the zenith just 1° westward and disappearing only 19° above the northern horizon (thus crossing about 60% of the sky). Its camera was also equipped with a rotating shutter that interrupted the exposure 12.5 times per second and divided the captured track of the fireball, allowing the determination of its speed. Over the last 4°, the fireball's angular velocity was lower than the resolution of the instrument. The Svratouch image recorded the trajectory only for about 15°, beginning at 30° above the northwest horizon, and the pictured fireball was quite weak. Despite this, the data were sufficient for the calculations.\n\nGotfred M. Kristensen also detected the fireball in Havdrup, Denmark, using a pen recorder connected to a radio receiver for 78 seconds, at 03:27:24±6 UT.\n\nThe meteoroid grazed Earth's atmosphere quite gently (in comparison to, for example, the 1972 Great Daylight Fireball above the United States and Canada). It became visible north of Uherský Brod, Czechoslovakia, at a height of 103.7 km, approaching the Earth's surface to 98.67 km northeast of Wrocław, Poland, and disappearing from sight at a height of 100.4 km north of Poznań, Poland. It would probably still have been visible until it reached a height of 110 km above the southern Baltic Sea.\n\nThe meteoroid's absolute magnitude (the apparent magnitude it would have at an altitude of 100 km at the observer's zenith) was approximately −6 and did not vary significantly during the few seconds of observation. It traveled a distance of 409 km in 9.8 seconds during the time it was observed. It moved at a speed of 41.74 km per second, which did not change measurably during the flight. Jiří Borovička and Zdeněk Ceplecha from the Ondřejov Observatory in Czechoslovakia estimated that the deceleration caused by the friction of the atmosphere reached only 1.7 m/s at the fireball's perigee (closest approach to Earth), and its velocity was reduced by only 0.012 km per second (less than 0.03%). This corresponds well with computer simulations provided by D. W. Olson, R. L. Doescher and K. M. Watson at the Southwest Texas State University, who concluded that the deceleration was less than 0.5 m/s except for a few seconds near perigee. This small loss of speed, 12 m per second, corresponded to a loss of kinetic specific energy (in the earth's frame of reference) of 0.5 MJ/kg, which was converted to heat (and perhaps sound). The change in the object's velocity vector due to Earth's gravity during the hours it was in the earth's vicinity was on the order of kilometres per second (see #Orbit).\n\nThe software also calculated the fireball's instantaneous apparent magnitude at the ground. The computation started and ended with heights of approximately 250 km, long before and after the cameras of the European Fireball Network could observe it. Its apparent magnitude started at a value of +5.7 and it became brighter quite quickly. The program gave an apparent magnitude of −5.7 when it was seen by one camera and −6.3 at perigee. The fireball subsequently dimmed, with an apparent magnitude of −5.4 when it was last seen by the cameras and a final calculated value of +6.0 at a height of 257 km. These values are not entirely certain, because the program worked with the simplified assumption that the luminous efficacy of the fireball did not change along the track. The starting apparent magnitude is not far from the naked eye visibility limits. For example, faint stars of the magnitude +6 can be observed only in dark rural areas approximately 150 km away from large cities. This magnitude corresponds to the apparent magnitude of Uranus. At its brightest, it was several times as bright as the maximum brightness of Venus.\n\nThe meteoroid was a type I fireball, i.e. an ordinary chondrite. When it entered Earth's atmosphere its mass was about 44 kg, which was estimated on the basis of the measured values of its absolute magnitude and velocity. It lost approximately 350 g during the encounter. Computer simulations showed that it started losing mass approximately at the moment it became visible to the cameras of the European Fireball Network, at a height of 100.6 km. It lost mass for 25 seconds, until it reached a height of 215.7 km. Its surface melted and solidified again after leaving, which means its surface became a typical meteoritic fusion crust.\n\nThe meteoroid was not dangerous to life on Earth. Even if it had headed towards lower parts of the atmosphere it would have heated so much that it would have exploded high above the ground and only some small particles (meteorites) eventually might have made it to Earth's surface.\n\nBecause the fireball was recorded by two cameras of the European Fireball Network, it was possible to calculate the trajectory of its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter orbit in the Solar System. The calculations were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who specialize in meteor observations. They demonstrated that the swing by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (the farthest it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).\n\nApproximately every 2.5 or 2.6 years, the object comes back to the point in the solar system where the 1990 encounter occurred, and the earth comes back to the same point every year. The period is not known precisely enough to predict when the next encounter between the two will occur.\n\nAlthough entries of meteoroids into Earth's atmosphere are very common, recording a similar flight through the upper layers of the atmosphere is quite rare. Probably the first one reliably verified happened on 20 July 1860 above the American state of New York. The Czechoslovak–Polish fireball is sometimes compared to the 1972 Great Daylight Fireball above Utah, the United States, and Alberta, Canada, which is the first scientifically observed and studied event of this type.

This phenomenon was first noted by Fridtjof Nansen, who recorded that ice transport appeared to occur at an angle to the wind direction during his Arctic expedition during the 1890s. The direction of transport is dependent on the hemisphere: in the northern hemisphere, transport occurs at 90° clockwise from wind direction, while in the southern hemisphere it occurs at a 90° counterclockwise.\n\nEkman theory explains the theoretical state of circulation if water currents were driven only by the transfer of momentum from the wind. In the physical world, this is difficult to observe because of the influences of many simultaneous current driving forces (for example, pressure and density gradients). Though the following theory technically applies to the idealized situation involving only wind forces, Ekman motion describes the wind-driven portion of circulation seen in the surface layer.\n\nSurface currents flow at a 45° angle to the wind due to a balance between the Coriolis force and the drags generated by the wind and the water. If the ocean is divided vertically into thin layers, the magnitude of the velocity (the speed) decreases from a maximum at the surface until it dissipates. The direction also shifts slightly across each subsequent layer (right in the northern hemisphere and left in the southern hemisphere). This is called the Ekman spiral. The layer of water from the surface to the point of dissipation of this spiral is known as the Ekman layer. If all flow over the Ekman layer is integrated, the net transportation is at 90° to the right (left) of the surface wind in the northern (southern) hemisphere.\n\nSome assumptions of the fluid dynamics involved in the process must be made in order to simplify the process to a point where it is solvable. The assumptions made by Ekman were:\n\nThe simplified equations for the Coriolis force in the \"x\" and \"y\" directions follow from these assumptions:\n\nwhere formula_5 is the wind stress, formula_6 is the density, formula_7 is the East-West velocity, and formula_8 is the north-south velocity.\n\nIntegrating each equation over the entire Ekman layer:\n\nwhere\n\nHere formula_13 and formula_14 represent the zonal and meridional mass transport terms with units of mass per unit time per unit length. Contrarily to common logic, north-south winds cause mass transport in the East-West direction.\n\nIn order to understand the vertical velocity structure of the water column, equations and can be rewritten in terms of the vertical eddy viscosity term.\n\nwhere formula_1 is the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient.\n\nThis gives a set of differential equations of the form\n\nIn order to solve this system of two differential equations, two boundary conditions can be applied:\n\nThings can be further simplified by considering wind blowing in the \"y\"-direction only. This means is the results will be relative to a north-south wind (although these solutions could be produced relative to wind in any other direction):\n\nwhere\n\nBy solving this at \"z\"=0, the surface current is found to be (as expected) 45 degrees to the right (left) of the wind in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere. This also gives the expected shape of the Ekman spiral, both in magnitude and direction. Integrating these equations over the Ekman layer shows that the net Ekman transport term is 90 degrees to the right (left) of the wind in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Different types of forest can be identified by their species composition which depends mostly on the altitude, latitude and substrate (soil and rock types) in which they grow. South facing slopes are favourable for the development of forest as they are more shaded, and therefore cooler and retain more moisture than the northern slopes. The extra moisture on the south slopes is not only favoured by forest trees, but also helps to prevent or subdue wildfires. Fires can also be blocked by cliff faces and rocks or boulders on these slopes, and by streams or rivers at the base of the slopes. The coastal regions are conducive to forest formation, because of high rainfall and humidity which are favoured by forest trees and also help to prevent or subdue fires. The rivers of the coastal areas are also broader than further inland, which may often prevent fires from spreading long distances, and fires generally burn uphill and therefore more often away from areas at low altitude.\n\nVarious forest types can be distinguished, but many of these overlap or integrate with each other for example; coastal dune forest can fade into coastal lowland forest, which can in turn fade into riverine forest.\n\nFound in secluded valleys in the Drakensberg area. Characteristic tree species include yellowwoods (\"Afrocarpus falcatus\" and \"Podocarpus latifolius\"), mountain hard pear (\"Olinia emarginata\") and Cape beech (\"Rapanea melanophloeos\"). Mountain cypress (\"Widdringtonia nodiflora\") may occur on the forest margins.\n\nFound in secluded valleys in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. Characteristic trees are; yellowwoods (including \"Afrocarpus falcatus\", \"Podocarpus latifolius\" and \"Podocarpus henkelii\"), Natal krantz ash (\"Atalaya natalensis\"), red stinkwood (\"Prunus Africana\"), sneezwood (\"Ptaeroxylon obliquum\") and forest elder (\"Nuxia floribunda\"). The forest tree fern (\"Cyathea capensis\") is also found in these forests.\n\nThis type is found on slopes and in secluded valleys between the coast and the Mistbelt. Trees include: white stinkwood (\"Celtis africana\"), forest bushwillow (\"Combretum krausii\") and umzimbeet (\"Millettia grandis\"). The Natal cycad (\"Encephalartos natalensis\") may occur on the forest edges, usually among rocks.\n\nOnce found almost continuously along the KwaZulu-Natal coast. Trees found here include; flat-crown (\"Albizia adianthifolia\"), coastal goldenleaf (\"Bridelia micrantha\"), red beech (\"Protorhus longifolia\"), forest mahogany (\"Trichilia dregeana\"), forest fever-berry (\"Croton sylvaticus\") and wild date palm (\"Phoenix reclinata\").\n\nFound on ancient inland sand dunes in Maputaland in the north of KwaZulu-Natal. Unique trees include Lebombo wattle (\"Newtonia hildebrandtii\"), red-heart tree (\"Hymenocardia ulmoides\"), lavender-leaved croton (\"Croton pseudopulchellus\") and stink bushwillow (\"Pteleopsis myrtifolia\").\n\nOnce found almost continuously along the coastal dunes of KwaZulu-Natal. Characteristic trees are: coastal red milkwood (\"Mimusops caffra\"), coast silver oak (\"Brachylaena discolor\"), dune soap-berry (\"Deinbollia oblongifolia\") and Natal wild banana (\"Strelitzia nicolai\"). The large-leaved dragon tree (\"Dracaena aletriformis\") is also found here.\n\nThis forest type occurs along natural waterways, even in dry areas that would not normally support forest. Trees found here include; \"Ficus sycomorus\", \"Ficus polita\", quinine tree (\"Rauvolfia caffra\") and fever tree (\"Acacia xanthophloea\"). These forests are vulnerable to flooding and many were destroyed by Cyclone Domoina.\n\nFound around the edges of lowland lakes and streams. Various fig trees are found here including \"Ficus sur\" and \"Ficus trichopoda\", as well as the wild swamp poplar (\"Macaranga capensis\"). The water fig (\"Ficus verruculosa\") and Kosi palm (\"Raphia australis\") are characteristic species in Maputaland.\n\nOccurs in favourable tidal estuaries along the coast. Species include the black mangrove (\"Bruguiera gymnorhiza\"), red mangrove (\"Rhizophora mucronata\") and white mangrove (\"Avicennia marina\"). The powder-puff tree (\"Barringtonia racemosa\") and the wild cotton tree (\"Hibiscus tiliaceus\") are sometimes classed as mangrove trees, but grow mostly along estuaries that are less tidal. They may form a transition zone between mangrove forest and swamp forest. \n\n\nSeveral animals are adapted to living in these forests. Many are locally adapted subspecies of animals found further north in Tropical Africa, such as the blue duiker and Samango monkey, but some are local endemic species like the dwarf chameleons (\"Bradypodion\" spp.), Natal forest tree frog and bush squeaker frog.\n\nBirds:\n\nNarina trogon (\"Apaloderma narina\"), purple-crested turaco (\"Tauraco porphyreolophus\"), forest weaver (\"Ploceus bicolor\"), crowned eagle (\"Stephanoaetus coronatus\"), spotted ground-thrush (\"Zoothera guttata\"), orange thrush (\"Zoothera gurneyi\") and Delegorgue's pigeon (\"Columba delegorguei\").\n\nMammals:\n\nBlue duiker, red duiker, bushbuck, nyala, bushpig, leopard and Samango monkey.\n\nReptiles:\n\nEastern green mamba, forest cobra and Gaboon adder.\n\nA wide range of herbaceous plants are found in the forests, either as ground cover or in the trees as epiphytes. Various lianas and climbers are also common plants in these forests.\n\nHerbaceous ground plants:\n\nBush lily (\"Clivia miniata\"), blood lily (\"Scadoxus puniceus\"), mother-in-law's-tongue (\"Sanseveria hyacinthoides\"), white paintbrush (\"Haemanthus albiflos\"), forest commelina (\"Coleotrype natalensis\"), small chlorophytum (\"Chlorophytum modestum\"), buckweed (\"Isoglossa woodii\"), many species of \"Plectranthus\" including \"Plectranthus ambiguus\", \"Plectranthus ecklonii\", and \"Plectranthus fruticosus\". Non-flowering plants include; the ground cycad (\"Encephalartos villosus\"), stangeria cycad (\"Stangeria eriopus\") and various mosses and ferns. Some grasses also grow in open forest and glades such as basket grass (\"Oplismenus hirtellus\"), broad-leaved panicum (\"Panicum deustum\") and broad-leaved bristle grass (\"Setaria megaphylla\").\n\nEpiphytes:\n\nMatches mistletoe (\"Tapinanthus kraussianus\"), hairy-lipped polystachya (\"Polystachya pubescens\"), leopard orchid (\"Ansellia africana\"), other orchids such as; \"Mystacidium capense\", \"Mystacidium venosum\", \"Polystachya ottoniana\", \"Angraecum conchiferum\", \"Cyrtorchis arcuata\" and \"Diapananthe caffra\". Mosses and ferns may also grow as epiphytes.\n\nClimbers:\n\nBlack-eyed susan (\"Thunbergia alata\"), wild cucumber (\"Coccinia palmata\"), climbing bamboo (\"Flagellaria guineensis\") and flame lily (\"Gloriosa superba\").\n\nCoastal scarp and mistbelt forests were the main source of timber in South Africa before the advent of exotic timber plantations. Giant yellowwoods and stinkwoods were the most sought-after trees. Most of the larger forests are now protected, but some small scale timber extraction by local communities still takes place. Attempts to grow indigenous trees as timber plantations have so far proven economically unviable compared to exotics, but more research is needed. A promising species is the fast-growing \"Trema orientalis\" which is appropriate for paper and pulp production; producing paper with good tensile strength and folding endurance. Another species for closer study is \"Celtis africana\", which is fast-growing and can be used for furniture and panelling. Both of these species could be used as cover for slower-growing forest hardwoods which could be interplanted for more long-term production of more valuable timber.\n\nForests have been a source of medicinal plants for hundreds of years. It is estimated that more than 2100 tonnes of medicinal plants are extracted from forest areas in KwaZulu-Natal each year, which is projected to be unsustainable.\n\nEco-tourism is the most viable and sustainable option for the forests of Kwazulu-Natal, and several government, private and non-government projects to ensure this are underway or in the planning stages.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3093634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3093634", "title": "Global Forecast System", "text": "Global Forecast System\n\nThe Global Forecast System (GFS) is a global numerical weather prediction system containing a global computer model and variational analysis run by the United States' National Weather Service (NWS).\n\nThe mathematical model is run four times a day, and produces forecasts for up to 16 days in advance, but with decreased spatial resolution after 10 days. The forecast skill generally decreases with time (as with any numerical weather prediction model) and for longer term forecasts, only the larger scales retain significant accuracy. It is one of the predominant synoptic scale medium-range models in general use.\n\nThe GFS model is a spectral model with an approximate horizontal resolution of 13 km for the first 10 days and 27 km from 240 to 384 hours (16 days). In the vertical, the model is divided into 64 layers and temporally, it produces forecast output every hour for the first 120 hours, three hourly through day 10 and 12 hourly through day 16. The output from the GFS is also used to produce model output statistics.\n\nIn addition to the main model, the GFS is also the basis of a lower-resolution 20-member (22, counting the control and operational members) ensemble that runs concurrently with the operational GFS and is available on the same time scales. This ensemble is referred to as the \"Global Ensemble Forecast System\" (GEFS). Ensemble model output statistics are available out to 8 days. The GFS ensemble is combined with Canada's Global Environmental Multiscale Model ensemble to form the North American Ensemble Forecast System (NAEFS).\n\nAs with most works of the U.S. government, GFS data is not copyrighted and is available for free in the public domain under provisions of U.S. law. Because of this, the model serves as the basis for the forecasts of numerous private, commercial, and foreign weather companies.\n\nBy 2015 the GFS model had fallen behind the accuracy of other global weather models. This was most notable in the GFS model incorrectly predicting Hurricane Sandy turning out to sea until 4 days before landfall, while the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' model predicted landfall correctly at 7 days. Much of this was suggested to be due to limits in computational resources within the National Weather Service. In response, the NWS purchased new supercomputers, increasing processing power from 776 teraflops to 5.78 petaflops. In 2018, the processing power was increased again to 8.4 petaflops, The agency has also been testing a potential replacement model with different mechanics, the flow-following, finite-volume icosahedral model (FIM), since the early 2010s.\n\nIn 2019, as a result of the recent tenfold increase in computing power, an upgrade to the GFS model is planned that will increase its horizontal resolution to 9 km and 128 layers out to 16 days, compared to the current run of 13 km and 64 layers out to 10 days. \n\nAs of the 12z run on 19 July 2017, the GFS model has been upgraded. Unlike the recently upgraded ECMWF, the new GFS behaves a bit differently in the tropics and in other regions compared to the previous version. This version accounts more accurately for variables such as the Madden–Julian oscillation and the Saharan Air Layer.\n\nLong-term plans are for the GFS to receive a new core with dynamic scaling that uses the finite volume method. The resulting model, being developed under the name FV3, will retain the GFS moniker. The proposal comes after eight years of testing a potential replacement model, the flow-following, finite-volume icosahedral model; the FIM proved to be slower and not appreciably more accurate than the GFS. Initial testing of the FV3 showed promise, outperforming the Integrated Forecast System in terms of hurricane tracks during the 2017 hurricane season (the IFS had been the most accurate operational model in predicting the paths).\n\n\nNOAA GFS Model Information Website\n\n"}

The Helmholtz equation, which represents a time-independent form of the wave equation, results from applying the technique of separation of variables to reduce the complexity of the analysis.\n\nFor example, consider the wave equation\n\nSeparation of variables begins by assuming that the wave function \"u\"(r, \"t\") is in fact separable:\n\nSubstituting this form into the wave equation and then simplifying, we obtain the following equation:\n\nNotice that the expression on the left side depends only on r, whereas the right expression depends only on \"t\". As a result, this equation is valid in the general case if and only if both sides of the equation are equal to a constant value. From this observation, we obtain two equations, one for \"A\"(r), the other for \"T\"(\"t\"):\nand\nwhere we have chosen, without loss of generality, the expression −\"k\" for the value of the constant. (It is equally valid to use any constant \"k\" as the separation constant; −\"k\" is chosen only for convenience in the resulting solutions.)\n\nRearranging the first equation, we obtain the Helmholtz equation:\n\nLikewise, after making the substitution\nthe second equation becomes\nwhere \"k\" is the wave vector, and \"ω\" is the angular frequency.\n\nWe now have Helmholtz's equation for the spatial variable r and a second-order ordinary differential equation in time. The solution in time will be a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, with angular frequency of ω, while the form of the solution in space will depend on the boundary conditions. Alternatively, integral transforms, such as the Laplace or Fourier transform, are often used to transform a hyperbolic PDE into a form of the Helmholtz equation.\n\nBecause of its relationship to the wave equation, the Helmholtz equation arises in problems in such areas of physics as the study of electromagnetic radiation, seismology, and acoustics.\n\nThe solution to the spatial Helmholtz equation\n\ncan be obtained for simple geometries using separation of variables.\n\nThe two-dimensional analogue of the vibrating string is the vibrating membrane, with the edges clamped to be motionless. The Helmholtz equation was solved for many basic shapes in the 19th century: the rectangular membrane by Siméon Denis Poisson in 1829, the equilateral triangle by Gabriel Lamé in 1852, and the circular membrane by Alfred Clebsch in 1862. The elliptical drumhead was studied by Émile Mathieu, leading to Mathieu's differential equation. The solvable shapes all correspond to shapes whose dynamical billiard table is integrable, that is, not chaotic. When the motion on a correspondingly-shaped billiard table is chaotic, then no closed form solutions to the Helmholtz equation are known. The field of quantum chaos includes the study of such systems, as the Helmholtz equation and similar equations occur in quantum mechanics (see Schrödinger equation).\n\nIf the edges of a shape are straight line segments, then a solution is integrable or knowable in closed-form only if it is expressible as a finite linear combination of plane waves that satisfy the boundary conditions (zero at the boundary, i.e., membrane clamped).\n\nAn interesting situation happens with a shape where about half\nof the solutions are integrable, but the remainder are not. A simple shape where this happens is with the regular hexagon. If the wavepacket describing a quantum billiard ball is made up of only the closed-form solutions, its motion will not be chaotic, but if any amount of non-closed-form solutions are included, the quantum billiard motion becomes chaotic. Another simple shape where this happens is with an \"L\" shape made by reflecting a square down, then to the right.\n\nIf the domain is a circle of radius \"a\", then it is appropriate to introduce polar coordinates \"r\" and θ. The Helmholtz equation takes the form\n\nWe may impose the boundary condition that \"A\" vanish if \"r\" = \"a\"; thus\n\nThe method of separation of variables leads to trial solutions of the form\n\nwhere Θ must be periodic of period 2. This leads to\n\nand\n\nIt follows from the periodicity condition that\n\nand that \"n\" must be an integer. The radial component \"R\" has the form\n\nwhere the Bessel function \"J\"(\"ρ\") satisfies Bessel's equation\n\nand \"ρ\" = \"kr\". The radial function \"J\" has infinitely many roots for each value of \"n\", denoted by \"ρ\". The boundary condition that \"A\" vanishes where \"r\" = \"a\" will be satisfied if the corresponding wavenumbers are given by\n\nThe general solution \"A\" then takes the form of a doubly infinite sum of terms involving products of\n\nThese solutions are the modes of vibration of a circular drumhead.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, the solution is:\n\nThis solution arises from the spatial solution of the wave equation and diffusion equation. Here formula_22 and formula_23 are the spherical Bessel functions, and\n\nare the spherical harmonics (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1964). Note that these forms are general solutions, and require boundary conditions to be specified to be used in any specific case. For infinite exterior domains, a radiation condition may also be required (Sommerfeld, 1949).\n\nWriting formula_25 function formula_26 has asymptotics\n\nwhere function \"f\" is called scattering amplitude and formula_28 is the value of \"A\" at each boundary point formula_29.\n\nIn the paraxial approximation of the Helmholtz equation, the complex amplitude \"A\" is expressed as\n\nwhere \"u\" represents the complex-valued amplitude which modulates the sinusoidal plane wave represented by the exponential factor. Then under a suitable assumption, \"u\" approximately solves\n\nwhere formula_32 is the transverse part of the Laplacian.\n\nThis equation has important applications in the science of optics, where it provides solutions that describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves (light) in the form of either paraboloidal waves or Gaussian beams. Most lasers emit beams that take this form.\n\nThe assumption under which the paraxial approximation is valid is that the \"z\" derivative of the amplitude function \"u\" is a slowly-varying function of \"z\":\n\nThis condition is equivalent to saying that the angle θ between the wave vector k and the optical axis \"z\" is small: \nformula_34.\n\nThe paraxial form of the Helmholtz equation is found by substituting the above-stated expression for the complex amplitude into the general form of the Helmholtz equation as follows:\n\nExpansion and cancellation yields the following:\n\nBecause of the paraxial inequalitiy stated above, the ∂u/∂z term is neglected in comparison with the k·∂u/∂z term. This yields the paraxial Helmholtz equation. Substituting formula_37 then gives the paraxial equation for the original complex amplitude \"A\":\n\nThe Fresnel diffraction integral is an exact solution to the paraxial Helmholtz equation.\n\nThere is even a subject named \"Helmholtz optics\" based on the equation, named in honour of Helmholtz.\n\nThe inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation is the equation\n\nwhere \"ƒ\" : R → C is a function with compact support, and \"n\" = 1, 2, 3. This equation is very similar to the screened Poisson equation, and would be identical if the plus sign (in front of the \"k\" term) is switched to a minus sign.\n\nIn order to solve this equation uniquely, one needs to specify a boundary condition at infinity, which is typically the Sommerfeld radiation condition\n\nuniformly in formula_41 with formula_42, where the vertical bars denote the Euclidean norm.\n\nWith this condition, the solution to the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation is the convolution\n\n(notice this integral is actually over a finite region, since formula_44 has compact support).

{"id": "5018766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5018766", "title": "Humid Pampas", "text": "Humid Pampas\n\nThe Humid Pampas () is an extensive ecoregion of flat, fertile grassland of loessic origin in Argentina. It has a precipitation average of 900 mm per year, in contrast with the Dry Pampas to the west, which average less than 700 mm.\n\nLike the Pampas in general, the region's terrain is predominantly hilly and of a temperate climate, though rich mollisols are more abundant here than to the west, where soils of loessic origin are more common. Except for a few bluffs near the Paraná and Río de la Plata rivers, as well as the Tandilia and Ventania mountain ranges to the south, the region's slope rarely exceeds 6 degrees. It covers Buenos Aires Province almost completely, the centre and south of Santa Fe Province, most of Córdoba Province and the eastern third of La Pampa Province, totalling at least 600,000 km².\n\nThe Uruguayan savanna, which lies east of the rivers in Entre Ríos Province of Argentina, Uruguay and the south of Brazil, is sometimes considered part of the Humid Pampa. The Uruguayan savanna is not as flat as the named aforementioned areas.\n\nThe flatlands are also interrupted by low hill's ranges like Tandilia in the southeast, namely at Sierra de los Padres, Balcarce, Olavarría, Tandil and like the higher system of the Sierra de la Ventana to the south, near Bahía Blanca. Finally, there are also some dunes at the Atlantic coast, such as at the city of Banderaló.\n\nThe area is characterised by four distinct seasons. Winter brings chilly, occasionally frosty nights. Humid, temperate weather characterizes spring and fall. Summer days can be extremely hot. The natural vegetation comprises meadows of high grass with isolated forests (locally referred to as \"montes\") of algarrobos, talas and chanares, which used to be common in areas near the main rivers but have been mostly cut down during the 20th century. The great rhea lives in the pampas of Argentina and eats plants, lizards, insects, frogs, small birds and snakes.\n\nThe Humid Pampa is characterized by medium-height grassland, with both perennial and annual grasses with scattered herbs and shrubs. The grasslands are interspersed with areas of dry woodland as well as freshwater and saltwater wetlands and lagoons.\n\nThe ombú, considered an emblem of the Humid Pampa (and not a proper tree but a herb), grows naturally north of the Río de la Plata and east of the Paraná, seldom south of the Río de la Plata and never south of the Salado. Before the introduction of cattle, horses and sheep by the Spaniards on the 16th century, the region was covered by hard grass, but the animals' grazing facilitated the growth of softer, greener grass.\n\nDue to the important immigration to Argentina in the second half of the 19th century and first decades of the 20th, and because the weather allowed for two annual harvests, the lands started being heavily used for agriculture, which made Argentina a major agricultural producer (the self-styled \"Granary of the World\"). Being fertile and close to the Atlantic Ocean, the Humid Pampa was one of the preferred destinations of millions of immigrants, who were mostly Italian, French and Spanish, but also German and other Europeans.\n\nThe lands of the region were taken care of by the \"gauchos\" for centuries, and the region was the centre of their culture, including their music and dances. Areas that were kept for extensive breeding of cattle and sheep stayed under the control of large estates' owners, and in lesser number to medium-size estates. Smaller farms are known as \"chacras\" (their owners being \"chacareros\" or \"chacreros\").\n\nThe urban population of Argentina (89% of its 38.6 million inhabitants, as estimated for 2005) is concentrated today in cities within the Humid Pampa (Buenos Aires, Córdoba and Rosario are the largest). In all, over 23 million Argentines live in this area, which produces two-thirds of the Argentine economy.\n\nGiven the commercial and agricultural desirability of most of this area for the last 130 years, not much pristine land remains. One of the best corners of unspoiled pampa is the Otamendi Natural Preserve near Campana, Buenos Aires Province. Established in 1990 on 2,600 hectares (10 mi) of former grazing land, the parcel has become one of Argentina's chief points of interest in its agrotourism circuit.\n\n"}

William Carleton's stories suggest that faeries plant the hungry grass. According to Harvey this myth may relate to beliefs formed in the Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s. In Margaret McDougall's letters the phrase \"hungry grass\" is - by analogy to the myth - used to describe hunger pains.\n\nAn alternative version of the hungry grass story relates that anyone walking through it is struck by temporary hunger; to safely cross through one must carry a bit of food to eat along the way (such as a sandwich or several crackers), and some beer.\n"}

{"id": "20084649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20084649", "title": "Indian Monsoon Current", "text": "Indian Monsoon Current\n\nThe Indian Monsoon Current refers to the seasonally varying ocean current regime found in the tropical regions of the northern Indian Ocean. During winter, the flow of the upper ocean is directed westward from near the Indonesian Archipelago to the Arabian Sea. During the summer, the direction reverses, with eastward flow extending from Somalia into the Bay of Bengal. These variations are due to changes in the wind stress associated with the Indian monsoon. The seasonally reversing open ocean currents that pass south of India are referred to as the Winter Monsoon Current and the Summer Monsoon Current (alternately, the Northeast Monsoon Current and the Southwest Monsoon Current). The Somali Current, which is strongly linked to the Indian monsoon, is also discussed in this article.\n\nAlthough Mariners have been aware of the existence of the Monsoon current for nearly one thousand years, a detailed understanding did not emerge until after the International Indian Ocean Expedition of the 1960s. The World Ocean Circulation Experiment of the mid 1990s permitted detailed measurement of these currents through an extensive field campaign.\n\nIn the northern hemisphere tropical regions of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, surface winds blow predominantly from the northeast year round, with westward-flowing ocean currents underneath. The Indian Ocean differs from the Atlantic and Pacific in that a continental landmass forms a complete northern boundary at relatively low latitudes. Monsoonal circulations are driven by the differences in temperature between land masses and adjacent oceans. Because water has a larger thermal capacity than air, land surfaces will heat more rapidly during the summer season. The Indian monsoon consists of two phases. During the northern hemisphere winter, the cool Asian landmass contains a broad area of high pressure, whereas lower pressures prevail over the warmer Indian Ocean and hot Australian continent. This pressure pattern helps to reinforce the northeasterly trade winds. During the northern hemisphere summer, the Asian landmass (especially the Indian subcontinent) heats considerably, generating an area of low pressure to the north. Circulation about this low generates strong winds from the southwest over the Arabian Sea and along the Somali coast. These winds are enhanced by the formation of an atmospheric western boundary current created by the high terrain over eastern Africa.\n\nA consequence of the Coriolis effect, Ekman theory explains that oceanic flow at the surface is directed at 45 degrees to the right of the wind stress in the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, winds blowing from the southwest result in eastward currents, while winds blowing from the northeast result in westward currents.\n\nThe Winter Monsoon Current extends from the Bay of Bengal, around India and Sri Lanka, and across the Arabian Sea at a latitude of approximately 8 degrees North. Currents flow to the southwest along the coast of Somalia to the equator.\n\nMeasurements of the strengths of these currents have been obtained from ship drift records. The Northeast Monsoon Current is westward only during the months of January through March, and is strongest in February when it reaches 50 cm s. Estimates of westward volume transport range from 7 to 14 Sverdrups.\n\nThe Somali Current, which describes the flow along the Horn of Africa from the equator to around 9 degrees north, also shifts direction seasonally with the monsoon winds. It eventually separates from the coastline, turning to the right as it enters the Arabian Sea. The Summer Monsoon Current, located between 10 and 15 North latitude in the Arabian Sea, bends around India and Sri Lanka, and enters the Bay of Bengal. The Great Whirl is a gyre located around 10 N and 55 E, and is only present during the summer season.\n\nDuring the summer when the current flows toward the northeast, Ekman transport (to the right of the flow in the Northern Hemisphere) is offshore, transporting warmer waters deeper into the Arabian sea, and permitting upwelling of cooler waters along the coast. This sea surface temperature pattern (cooler waters west of warmer waters) reinforces the northward current through geostrophic flow.\nThe Southwest Monsoon Current is eastward from April through November, and reaches a peak intensity of 30 cm s during the summer months. During a 1995 field campaign, the Somali current was measured to transport 37 +/- 5 Sv during mid-September.\n\nThe rapid initiation of seasonal currents (over the time period of several weeks) can be explained theoretically in terms of linear theory with a Rossby wave response. The Monsoon Current can also be viewed in terms of local forcing processes that act in concert to create the mature, basin-wide system. The evolution of these currents have been reproduced in dynamical models of the ocean-atmosphere system.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1435809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1435809", "title": "Indian Ocean Commission", "text": "Indian Ocean Commission\n\nThe Indian Ocean Commission (, COI) is an intergovernmental organization that was created in 1982 at Port Louis, Mauritius and institutionalized in 1984 by the Victoria Agreement in Seychelles. The COI is composed of five African Indian Ocean nations: Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Réunion (an overseas region of France), and Seychelles. Notwithstanding their different characteristics (Reunion as a French overseas region; Mauritius and Seychelles as Middle-Income Countries whereas Comoros and Madagascar are amongst the Least-Developed Countries), the five islands share geographic proximity, historical and demographic relationships, natural resources and common development issues.\n\nCOI's principal mission is to strengthen the ties of friendship between the countries and to be a platform of solidarity for the entire population of the African Indian Ocean region. COI’s mission also includes development, through projects related to sustainability for the region, aimed at protecting the region, improving the living conditions of the populations and preserving the various natural resources that the countries depend on. Being an organisation regrouping only island states, the COI has usually championed the cause of small island states in regional and international fora.\n\nThe COI works on four pillars which have been adopted in 2005 by the Summit of Heads of States:\n\nThe original ideas were to encourage trade and tourism. Recently, cooperation has focused on marine conservation and fisheries management. The COI has funded a number of regional and national conservation and alternative livelihoods projects through ReCoMAP, Regional Programme for the Sustainable Management of the Coastal Zones of the Countries of the Indian Ocean (PROGECO in French). This project ended in 2011. An example of these projects is project to catalyze the development of sea cucumber and seaweed aquaculture in South West Madagascar with the NGOs, Transmad, Blue Ventures, and Madagascar Holothuria.\n\nThe Commission has a Secretariat which is located in Mauritius and headed by a Secretary General. The current Secretary General, Mr. Jean Claude de l’Estrac, is a Mauritius national who was appointed in July 2012 for a four-year mandate. Political and strategic orientations of the organisation are under the responsibility of the Council of Ministers which meets annually. The latest Council of Ministers in January 2013. The organisation also has a system of rotating presidency of each Member State. The Presidency is currently ensured by Comoros. The highest level of the organisation's structure is the Summit of Heads of States whose last meeting was held in Madagascar in 2005.\n\nEU partnership with the COI has been effective for as long as 25 years. The successive EDFs have financed programmes implemented by the COI to the tune of EUR 100 million, mainly in the area of environment and natural resources.\nThe EU, which is the main development partner of the COI, accounting for app. 70% of total financial support to COI, has scaled up its assistance to COI during the last few years. The EU has three main on-going programmes with the COI for a total amount of EUR 48 million*:\nThe Smartfish programme for the Implementation of a Regional Fisheries Strategy in the Eastern and Southern Africa and Indian Ocean region (ESA-IO region). Its overall objective is to contribute to an increased level of social, economic and environmental development and deeper regional integration in the ESA-IO through the sustainable exploitation of marine and lake fisheries resources;\nThe Islands programme for the Implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) of the ESA-IO region, which will contribute to an increased level of social, economic and environmental development and deeper regional integration through the sustainable development of SIDS in the ESA-IO region. This programme will assist beneficiary countries towards this year's United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio +20). A grant agreement of EUR 470 000 was recently signed between the EU and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs for the design and implementation of a Monitoring and Evaluation System to track countries progress in implementing the Mauritius Strategy.\n\nA programme to support the IMF Regional Technical Assistance Centres (AFRITACs) of the ESA-IO, namely AFRITAC East, based in Tanzania, and AFRITAC South, based in Mauritius. The programme's objective is to contribute to the regional economic integration process, and higher growth and poverty reduction in the ESA-IO region. More specifically, the programme aims at improving the design, implementation, and monitoring of sound macroeconomic policies, and enhanced regional harmonisation and integration, in ESA-IO Member States and Regional Organisations. Two grant agreements amounting to EUR 14 675 000 were signed between the EU and the IMF on 17 October 2011 on the occasion of the inauguration of AFRITAC South in Mauritius.\n\nA Start up Project to promote regional maritime security (Start up MASE Project): the Financing Agreement, which amounts to EUR 2 million, was signed on 13 December 2011 by the Secretary General of the Indian Ocean Commission, Callixte d'Offay and Alessandro Mariani, Ambassador, Head of Delegation to Mauritius, for the Seychelles and the Union of Comoros. The objective of the Start up MASE Project is to support the implementation of short term actions of the Regional Strategy and Action Plan against Piracy and for Maritime Security as adopted during the 2nd High Level Regional Ministerial Conference on Maritime Piracy Meeting held on 7 October 2010 in Mauritius and co-chaired by Catherine Ashton, the EU High Representative and Vice President of the European Commission.\n\nThe COI also implements part of two 10th EDF programmes which are under the responsibility of COMESA, namely:\nThe InterRegional Coordination Committee (IRCC) Project to support the Indian Ocean Commission in ensuring its tasks within the IRCC configuration. Activities which have been undertaken by the COI since February 2011, and will be continued up to August 2012 include: support to the preparation of new projects; support to the strengthening and restructuring of the COI Secretariat; setting up of the COI Project Monitoring and Evaluation System; facilitation for the development of an economic strategic plan for COI; and drawing up of COI Strategic Development Plan for 2012-2016.\n\nThe Regional Integration Support Programme (RISP) which aims at advancing the regional economic integration in the ESA-IO region. The programme is jointly implemented by the COMESA, the EAC, the IGAD and the COI for a period of three years from July 2010 to June 2013. Under the COI annual work plans, the focus is on activities to facilitate Member States participation in COMESA regional integration agenda, and in the overall regional integration agenda process, while promoting the specificity of small island states, based on the principle of subsidiarity.\n\nFrance/Reunion is not a beneficiary of EDF but may participate in programmes via its own funds, and contribute with its expertise in several areas. The collaboration is of primary importance to facilitate a good economic integration of countries and regions pertaining to the same geographical areas. It is pursued vigorously and positively by France/Reunion.\n\n"}

{"id": "31558103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31558103", "title": "Lake Esrum", "text": "Lake Esrum\n\nLake Esrum () is the largest lake in Denmark by water volume and the second-largest lake by surface area, after lake Arresø. It is situated in the central part of North Zealand (the northeastern region of Zealand), straddling the boundaries of the municipalities Hillerød, Fredensborg, Helsingør and Gribskov, some 40 kilometres north of Copenhagen.\n\nThe lake covers 17 km, Its length from north to south is 8.4 km and its maximum depth is 22 m. Its principal drainage is Esrum Å, a 10-km stream which passes Esrum Watermill and the remains of Esrum Abbey on its way to the Kattegat at Dronningmølle. The western shore of the lake is dominated by Gribskov, one of Denmark's largest forests, and the small town of Nødebo. Fredensborg Palace, one of the official residences of the Danish Royal Family, with its extensive gardens, is situated on the southeast shore. Boat trips operate on the lake from Sørup, a village just south of the palace gardens.\n\nLike many of the surrounding forests, Lake Esrum was originally a royal domain. It was first administrated by \"Tentekammeret\" and later by \"Frederiksborg Amtsstue\" on behalf of the Danish government. Fishing in the lake was entrusted with a fishing master (Danish: \"fiskemester\") who resided at Fiskergården, located next to Slotsmøllen at Slotssøen in Hillerød. From 1864, fishing was carried out by private citizens and from 1907, fishing rights were sold at auction. Commercial fishing continued until 1989.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 19th century, Lake Esrum played a role in the transport of firewood from Grib Forest to Copenhagen. From 1802 to 1805, a canal was constructed between the north end of the lake and Dronningmølle. Here firewood was loaded onto large cargo ships and sailed to Copenhagen. The canal was 9 km long, 9 m wide and 1.5 m deep. The work was led by Adolph von der Recke and carried out by local peasants, soldiers and forced labour workers. A towpath ran on the banks of the canal and on the western shores of lake Esrum. The timber had to pass a 4-metre crater-like ramp called \"Væltningen\", which connected the upper section of the canal to its lower part. The upper part of the canal passed two ponds. One of them, Storedam (Great Pond), was the site of a watermill which was first used as backup for the gunpowder mill in Frederiksværk during the English Wars and later for the manufacturing of textiles for the army. Transportation of firewood on the canal continued until 1874 and it was later used for leisure trips. It has now dried out and been covered by forest, but Væltningen and other elements are still visible in the landscape.\n\nFrom the middle of the 19th century, the small village of Sørup on the southeastern shores of the lake was home to numerous laundries. The laundry was picked up at institutions and wealthy households in both Copenhagen, Hillerød and Elsinore. When the industry peaked, Sørup was home to 20 laundries with some one hundred employees.\n\nThe water quality of lake Esrum is considered good.\n\nSince 2002, there have been a few incidences of trematoda plaguing swimmers in the summertime every year. The trematodes are a natural part of lake Esrums' aquatic life.\n\nLake Esrum have a large population of European perch and Northern pike. Other species includes European eel, ruffe, bream, roach, tench and bleak. A smaller population of brown trout is living here, having adapted to the freshwater.\n\nThe professional fishing for eel, was previously substantial, but in 1997 the annual catch had fallen to 388 kg from a mere 14 tons. Nowadays, the lake is exclusively fished by anglers.\n\nThe birdlife at the lake is varied. The common goldeneye was formerly a rare breeding bird in Denmark, but after a determined effort involving artificial nests, the species is almost a signature of lake Esrum. Other common birds here includes Eurasian coot, mallard, tufted duck, great crested grebe and mute swan. The reed beds along the lake brinks, hold many swan nests and in the southern end, a colony of the great cormorant have found a home, with several hundreds of nests.\n\nLake Esrum is part of a larger 7,400 ha Natura 2000 area, comprising Gribskov and a few smaller woodlands nearby. It is included in the Kongernes Nordsjælland National Park.\n\n\"Esrum Sø Bådfart\" (Lake Esrum Boat Service) operates boat trips on the lake from Chaluphuset, a former royal boathouse located at Sørup on the south side of Fredensborg Palace gardens. Chaluphuset is also used as a venue from special events. Esrum Sø Bådfart also operates a café in Fendrikshus, a former forest worker's house in Gribskov on the other side of the lake. The café is open Friday-Sunday and can be reached by boat or on foot or bicycle through the forest. Skipperhuset, Chaluphuset's next door neighbour, is a lunch restaurant overlooking the lake.\n\nEgon (Ove Sprogøe) and Kjeld (Morten Grunwald) are quarrelling with Lake Esrum as a backdrop (in Nødebo Holt) at 1:02:54 in the 1978 \"Olsen-banden\" film \"The Olsen Gang Sees Red\".\n\n\n"}

The warmest storage layer is the top storage cylinder and below this there are colder storage layers through natural layering. The water is fed into different storage levels, depending on the available feed temperature and current temperature layering. The feed takes place via a vertical line via valves, in each case the feed water is fed into the storage layer with the corresponding water temperature. This is achieved by means of self-acting valves, feeding the respective temperature or water density into the temperature layer. The advantage is that there is no mixing of the storage temperature. Swirling of the water is therefore to be avoided as far as possible in stratified storage tanks because this could lead to intermingling of storage layers. This is reduced by means of measures such as limiting flow velocity and baffle plates at the inlets.\n\nHeating is therefore only necessary later, since warm water can be taken from above for longer, as opposed to mixed storage. In addition, water can be drawn with almost the same temperature very quickly after filling with hot water, since not all of the storage tank has to be heated. This optimises energy efficiency.\n\nAt the moment, they are generally more expensive than combined storage tank, but the storage volume can be a bit smaller and they are considered more modern because of better energy consumption.\n\nIn addition to storage for, for example, single-family houses with a few hundred to over one thousand litres, they can also be found in larger and significantly larger forms, for example, as long-term thermal storage tanks with a few thousand litres of storage volume.\n\n\n"}

The season with the most storms to affect the state was the 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, when five storms affected Texas. Major storms during this period include the 1900 and 1915 Galveston Hurricanes, the former which killed 8,000 to 12,000 people. Also one to mention merit was the 1943 Surprise Hurricane, when the weather bureau's information was censored and killing 19 people.\n\nSeptember 8, 1900: A long-lived tropical cyclone trekked across the Caribbean and moved over Cuba. On September 4, the Galveston office of the U.S. Weather Bureau began receiving warnings from the Bureau's central office in Washington, D.C., that a tropical storm had moved northward over Cuba. The Weather Bureau forecasters had little way of knowing where the storm exactly was, and referenced climatology, preferring a storm track towards the middle Gulf coast. Conditions in the Gulf of Mexico were ripe for further strengthening of the storm. The Gulf had seen little cloud cover for several weeks, and the seas were as warm as bathwater, according to one report. The hurricane moved west-northwest towards the Texas coast. The last train to reach Galveston left Houston on the morning of the September 8 at 9:45 a.m. It found the tracks washed out, and passengers were forced to transfer to a relief train on parallel tracks to complete their journey. Even then, debris on the track kept the train's progress at a crawl. As the hurricane neared, conditions in Texas deteriorated, and residents just thought it was a thunderstorm. When the hurricane made landfall, it was of category four intensity. It destroyed the city of Galveston, and led to the rise of Houston. Although damage was significant across Galveston Island, the human toll was higher. The death toll is estimated to lie between 8,000-12,000.\n\nJuly 10, 1901 - The second storm of the 1901 season made landfall in Southeast Texas as a minimal tropical storm.\n\nJune 26, 1902 - The second storm of 1902 made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\nSeptember 30, 1905 - The third tropical storm entered Texas as a tropical depression.\n\nJuly 31, 1908 - The fourth tropical storm of the 1908 season formed and made landfall in Texas.\n\nSeptember 18, 1908 - The seventh tropical storm of the 1908 season dissipated right off the Texas coast.\n\nJune 29, 1909 - The second storm of 1909 hit Texas as a Category 2 hurricane near Bronwsville, according to the \"Best Track\" database maintained by the National Hurricane Center. Little information on this storm is known at this time.\n\nJuly 21, 1909 - The fourth storm hit near Freeport, Texas as a Category 3 hurricane; with a 10-foot (3-meter) storm surge. Damage totals came to $2 million (1909 dollars) and 41 people died.\n\nAugust 24, 1909 - a hurricane slammed into the Mexico and Texas area. Point Isabel, Texas was completely underwater. No one perished though.\n\n\nOctober 16, 1912 - The sixth storm of 1912 made its second landfall just south of Corpus Christi, Texas as a Category 1. 15 people died and damage came to over $28,000.\n\nJune 27, 1913 - The first storm of the 1913 season was Category 2 hurricane that struck Cancún, Mexico and Padre Island, Texas. This storm caused major flooding and killed one person.\n\nSeptember 19, 1914 - The remnants of a system affected Texas near the Louisiana border.\nAugust 17, 1915 - The second storm of the year was first observed in the eastern Tropical Atlantic on August 5. It tracked westward, intensifying into a hurricane on the 9th before crossing the Lesser Antilles on the 10th. As the hurricane continued through the Caribbean Sea, it passed just south of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola before crossing Jamaica on the 13th where it caused heavy damage. While south of Cuba it became a major hurricane, and it brushed the western tip of the country on the 15th. Over the Gulf of Mexico the hurricane continued to strengthen, and reached a peak of 140 mph winds. Just before landfall it weakened, and the hurricane hit Galveston, Texas on the 17th as a 120 mph hurricane. It turned northward, became extratropical on the 18th, and dissipated on the 23rd. Just fifteen years after the 1900 Galveston Hurricane, this hurricane damaged the already hurting Texas economy. Throughout its path, it caused a total of $50 million in damage (1915 USD, $921 million in 2005 USD) and 400 casualties.\nAugust 18, 1916 - The 1916 Texas hurricane struck Corpus Christi, Texas on August 18 after striking Martinique. The storm caused over $28 million in damage, 1.6 million dollars in damage.\n\nAugust 6, 1918 - The remnants of the first storm of 1918 affected Texas after making landfall in Louisiana.\n\nSeptember 14, 1919 - The second storm of the 1919 season made landfall just south of Corpus Christi, Texas as a Category 1.\n\nJune 22, 1921 - The first hurricane of the 1921 season made landfall in Texas.\n\nSeptember 6, 1925 - The first storm of the 1925 season formed was a tropical storm that hit near Brownsville, Texas.\n\nAugust 27, 1926 - The third storm of the season entered Texas after making landfall in Louisiana.\n\nSeptember 22, 1926 - The sixth storm of the 1926 season entered made landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border.\n\nJune 29, 1929 - A category 1 hurricane struck near Freeport, Texas in 1929, the only town to suffer much damage from it.\n\nThe first storm of 1931 made landfall in the Galveston area as a tropical storm.\n\nIn 1932, the 1932 Freeport hurricane formed August 11 in the southern Gulf of Mexico near the Yucatán Peninsula and slammed into the upper Texas coast near Freeport, Texas as a very compact Category 4 hurricane two days later. As the storm moved over the Gulf of Mexico, it intensified from a Category 1 to a Category 4 with winds estimated at 140 mph and an estimated central pressure of 942 millibars in less than one day. The eye crossed the coast about 10 p.m. on August 13, slashing a 30- to 40-mile wide path of destruction across Brazoria County, Texas. Official warning for the storm came just 4 hours prior to landfall, and many people trying to evacuate inland had to abandon their cars in high winds and heavy rains. The 1932 hurricane retained its strength miles from the coast and killed 40 people. The greatest single toll for any town was 7 in West Columbia, Texas, where sustained winds over 100 mph flattened homes. Two neighborhoods that had been constructed for oil industry workers there were wiped clean. Freeport, Angleton and Galveston suffered extensive wind damage, and the inland towns of Brazoria, West Columbia, Damon and Needville, all in the path of the eye, were also devastated. Damage estimates topped $7 million in 1932 U.S. dollars.\n\nThe Texas area was alive with activity in 1933, with the second storm making landfall in Mexico after threatening Texas; the fourth storm making landfall near Matagorda Bay in Texas as a 45 mph (70 km/h) tropical storm on July 23. The fifth storm made landfall near Brownsville, Texas on August 5 as a strong tropical storm. The storm produced strong winds and high tides along the coast of Texas, while heavy rains in south Texas and northern Mexico caused heavy damage. High tides from the storm covered parts of South Padre Island. The tenth storm threatened Texas, causing the issuance of tropical storm warnings for portions of the southern Texas coastline. The eleventh storm made landfall just north of Brownsville early on September 5, killing 179 people and causing $28 million in damage.\nIn 1934, the third storm was a Category 1 hurricane passed over north Florida as a tropical storm and made landfall in central Texas, causing 11 casualties and $1–$2 million in damage. The fifth storm was another Category 1 hurricane that grazed Galveston.\n\nThe third storm of the 1936 season caused severe crop damage was reported in San Patricio and Nueces Counties. In all, the hurricane caused $550,000 (1936 USD) in damage, primarily to oil refinery property, though no deaths or injuries were reported. The fourteenth storm of the season made landfall near Brownsville.\n\nThe third and fifth storms of 1938 made landfall in the state.\n\nThe second storm of 1940 hit near the Texas/Louisiana border, and dissipated three days later over Missouri. One casualty and $1.7 million in damage from flooding has been attributed to this hurricane.\n\nIn 1941, the first storm hit the Texas coast between Galveston and Port Arthur. The storm dissipated the next day without causing any damage. The second storm hit Texas near Matagorda just below hurricane strength. It continued northward, and became extratropical later that day. The hurricane caused heavy flooding in Texas, amounting to $7 million in damage (1941 dollars) and 4 deaths.\n\nThe first storm of 1942 made landfall on the eastern Texas coast, and dissipated two days later over extreme southern Missouri. The hurricane caused around $600,000 in damage. The second storm hit the central Texas coast. The next day it dissipated over northwestern Texas, after resulting in $26.5 million in damage and eight casualties.\nThis hurricane was first detected on July 26, 1943. The United States was in the middle of the second World War and there were no satellites or weather radar. Because of the fear of U-boats in the Gulf, all radio traffic from ships was silenced, including storm reports. Newspaper articles mentioned a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico, but did not mention its true intensity. The storm struck the Bolivar Peninsula, crossed Galveston Bay, and made landfall a second time near the Houston Ship Channel. Because of war interests, warnings were few, and residents were caught off-guard. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at nearly 100 mph, with higher wind gusts. Damage was significant and primarily wind-related. The storm killed 19 people, and caused $17 million (1943 dollars) in damage to the Houston area. After the loss of life in this storm, weather information has never been censored again.\n\nThe following is a list of hurricanes with known deaths in the state.\n\n"}

This method can apply to both extant and extinct animals, according to the scope of the study. Mesowear is based on studying an animal's tooth wearing fingerprint. In brief, each animal has special feeding habits, which cause unique tooth wearing. Rough feeds cause serious tooth abrasion, while smooth one triggers moderate abrasion, so browsers have teeth with moderate abrasion and grazers have teeth with rough abrasion. Scoring systems can quantify tooth abrasion observations and ease comparisons between individuals.\n\nThe mesowear method or tooth wear scoring method is a quick and inexpensive process of determining the lifelong diet of a taxon (grazer or browser) and was first introduced in the year 2000.\nThe mesowear technique can be extended to extinct and also extant animals.\nMesowear analyses require large sample populations (>20), which can be problematic for some localities, but the method yields an accurate depiction of an animal's average lifelong diet. mesowear analysis, is based on the physical properties of ungulate foods as reflected in the relative amounts of attritive and abrasive wear that they cause on the dental enamel of the occlusal surfaces. Mesowear was recorded by examining the buccal apices of molar tooth cusps. Apices were characterized as sharp, rounded, or blunt, and the valleys between them either high or low. The method has been developed only for selenodont and trilophodont molars, but the principle is readily extendable to other crown types.In collecting the data the teeth are inspected at close range, a hand lens will be used. Mesowear analysis is insensitive to wear stage as long as the very early and very late stages are excluded.\nMesowear analysis follows standard protocols. Specimens are digitally photographed in labial view so that cusp shape and occlusal relief can be scored.\nthis method helps zoologists and nutritionists to prepare proper kind of hay for captive feral herbivores with unknown feed habits in zoos.\nIn collecting the data the teeth are inspected at close range, using a hand lens.\nGravity toward lower teeth causes more abrasion on lower teeth than upper theeth. This fact is base of mesowear method\nsharp: A sharp cusp terminates to a point and has practically no rounded area between the \nmesial and distal phase I facets,\nRound: a rounded cusp has a distinctly rounded tip (apex) without planar\nfacet wear but retains facets on the lower slopes.\n\nBlunt: blunt cusp lacks distinct facets altogether.\n\nThe attrition: this kind of dental wearing is as a result of rubbing tooth to tooth and no external forces cause this enamel abrasion.usually browsers feed contains less food abrasive materials( such as silica because of feed selecting behavior in this animals so wearing type of browser ungulates will be this type in most cases.\n\nThe abrasion: rubbing food to tooth triggers this kind of tooth wearing more visible for grazer animals than browsers.\n\n"}

The purpose of the Path, proposed by jaguar expert Alan Rabinowitz, is to allow jaguars to travel and inter-breed throughout their historical areas. The Panthera organization actively develops these corridors through their Jaguar Corridor Initiative.\n\nThe corridors created by this program allow for the natural roaming behavior of the jaguar and safeguard them from ranchers and farmers by giving jaguars natural cover, letting them avoid human activities as much as possible. These corridors in some cases are as small as a line of trees along a fence; they do not have to be something large, they simply have to be enough to link habitats together in continuous ground cover. A key component of the Path of the Jaguar is the creation of small preserves spaced along the corridor at key points. These preserves are just large enough for a jaguar to stay and hunt in for a day or two, offering an alternative to the risky endeavor of hunting livestock. \n\nThere are many potential connections between current jaguar habitats. A 2010 study by Rabinowitz suggested 182 of them, 44 of which are danger of being eliminated by human use.\n\n"}

The refraction microtremor technology was developed at the University of Nevada and is owned by the State of Nevada. Optim of Reno, Nevada has the exclusive license to develop the technology, and SeisOpt® ReMi™ has been available commercially from Optim since 2004. Since Rayleigh waves are dispersive, the propagating waves are measured along a linear seismic array and evaluated relative to wave frequency and slowness (or the inverse of the velocity). Due to the dispersive characteristics of higher frequency waves travelling through the more shallow conditions and lower frequency waves passing through deeper materials, a 1-D subsurface profile can be generated based on the velocity with depth.\n\nEquipment and Field Procedures\n\nThe method utilizes equipment typically employed in seismic refraction surveys. This equipment consists of a seismograph, geophones placed in an array, and a seismic source. An array consists of 6 to 48+ geophones placed at some interval along the ground surface to measure the propagating waves and are connected to a seismograph that records the data. Rayleigh waves are generated from seismic sources described to be active, passive, or a combination of both. For example, active sources can be generated sources from a sledge hammer striking a plate or other sources that are created near the traverse. Passive sources can be nearby highway traffic, construction equipment working in the distance, etc. Several recordings (typically 15 to 60+ seconds long) are captured and stored for later analysis. As multiple traverses are performed along the ground surface, the 1-D profiles can be compiled to generate a 2-D profile of the subsurface conditions. It is worth noting that since seismic traverses typically \"average\" conditions along the traverse length to some extent, the expectations and limitations of geophysical methods should be realized.\n\n\"Faster, Better: Shear-Wave Velocity to 100 Meters Depth from Refraction Microtremor Arrays\"\n\n\"Use of refraction microtremor (ReMi) data for shear wave velocity determination at an urban bridge rehabilitation site\"\n"}

It is located just north of smaller Ambon Island and a few other surrounding islands, such as Haruku, Geser, Nusalaut, Banda and Saparua.\n\nSeram is traversed by a central mountain range, the highest point of which, Mount Binaiya, is covered with dense rain forests. Its remarkably complex geology is because of its location at the meeting of several tectonic microplates, which has been described as \"one of the most tectonically complex areas on Earth\". Seram actually falls on its own microplate, which has been twisted around by 80° in the last 8 million years by the relatively faster movement of the Papua microplate. Meanwhile, along with the northward push of the Australian Plate, this has resulted in the uplift that gives north-central Seram peaks of over 3000 m. On the island are important karst areas. In the mountains near Sawai is the cave Hatu Saka, currently the deepest cave in Indonesia (-388 m). In Taniwell district, on the north coast, is the underground river Sapalewa, one of the largest underground rivers on the planet.\n\nThe population of the island in the 2010 Census was 434,113 people, administered among 3 regencies, Maluku Tengah Regency had 170,392 people on Seram Island itself and 191,306 on the lesser islands (majority on Ambon Island), the entirety of Seram Bagian Barat Regency and Seram Bagian Timur Regency.\n\nSeram Island is remarkable for its high degree of localised bird endemism. From the 117 species of birds on the island, 14 are endemic, including the eclectus parrot, purple-naped lory, salmon-crested cockatoo, Seram masked owl, lazuli kingfisher, sacred kingfisher, grey-necked friarbird and Moluccan king parrot.\n\nThe mammals found on Seram include Asian species (murid rodents) as well as Australasian marsupials. The montane area of Seram supports the greatest number of endemic mammals of any island in the region. It harbors 38 mammal species and includes nine species that are endemic or near endemic, several of which are limited to montane habitats. These include the Seram bandicoot, Moluccan flying fox, Seram flying-fox, Manusela mosaic-tailed rat, spiny Ceram rat and the Ceram rat, all considered threatened.\n\nSaltwater crocodiles exist within some of the island's rivers, including the Salawai River.\n\nIn the eastern part of the island, Manusela National Park has been established in 1997, covering an area of 1,890 km² (11% of the island).\n\nMost central Moluccans consider Seram to be their original ancestral home and it is still known colloquially as Nusa Ina (Mother Island).\nIn the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Seram was generally within the sphere of influence of Ternate, although it was often ruled more directly by the Ternaten vassal state of Buru. The expedition of António de Abreu (as captain) and Francisco Serrão sighted and explored the entire southern coast of Seram in early 1512, for the first time for Europeans. Portuguese missionaries were active there in the 16th century. Dutch trading posts were opened in the early 17th century, and the island came under nominal Dutch control c. 1650. In the 1780s, Seram provided a key base of support for Prince Nuku of Tidore's long-running rebellion against Dutch rule. From 1954 until 1962 the island's mountain terrain was the scene of an armed guerilla struggle against Indonesian rule by the counter revolutionary Republic of South Moluccas movement led by Soumokil.\n\nSeram includes three of the regencies within the province of Maluku. West Seram (Kabupaten Seram Bagian Barat), capital at Dataran Hunipopu, had a population (2003) of 140,657; and Eastern Seram (Kabupaten Seram Bagian Timur), capital at Dataran Hunimoa, had a population (2003) of 78,336. The Central Maluku Regency (Kabupaten Maluku Tengah), with its capital at Masohi, includes the middle part of Ceram, as well as some other smaller islands.\n\nSeram has been traditionally associated with the animism of the indigenous Alfur (or Nuaulu), a West Melanesian people who reputedly retained a custom of headhunting until the 1940s. Today, however, most of the population of Seram today is either Muslim or Christian due to both conversion and immigration. Seram was affected by the violent inter-religious conflict that swept Maluku province starting in late 1998, resulting in tens of thousands of displaced persons across the province but after the Malino II Accord agreement tempers cooled. Seram has been peaceful for many years but towns like Masohi remain informally divided into de facto Christian and Muslim sections.\nAround 7,000 people belonging to the Manusela tribe follow Hinduism.\n\nCopra, resin, sago, and fish are important products. Oil is produced in the northeast near Bula by CITIC Seram Energy who took over from KUFPEC (Indonesia) Limited in 2006. The Oseil oil field is located onshore in the northeast of the island in the Seram Non-Bula Production Sharing Contract area. The discovery well was drilled in 1993. As of end 2010 the Seram Non-Bula Block had estimated proven oil reserves of 9.7 million barrels. Most production comes from the Jurassic Manusela carbonate formation.\n\n\n"}

In June 1921, Olson took his first canoe trip where he fell in love with the canoe country wilderness of northern Minnesota that would become the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (with his help). His first article, an account of a canoe expedition, was published by the Milwaukee Journal on July 31, 1921. In August of that year, Olson married Elizabeth Dorothy Uhrenholdt, and the two spent their honeymoon on another canoe trip in the Boundary Waters. He worked as a canoe guide for J.C. Russell's outfitters on Fall Lake in Winton, Minnesota, before purchasing the business in 1929.\n\nHe led canoe expeditions for a group that became known as the \"Voyageurs,\" which routinely included Eric W. Morse, Denis Coolican, Blair Fraser, Tony Lovink, Eric W. Morse, Elliott Rodger, and Omond Solandt.\n\nAfter studying agriculture, botany, geology, and ecology at Northland College, the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and the University of Illinois, Olson moved to Ely, Minnesota to teach biology at Ely Junior College (now Vermilion Community College). He later chaired the science department and served as dean. in 1947 he resigned from his teaching position and began writing full-time. He spent most of his life in the Ely area, working as a canoe guide during the summer months, teaching, and writing about the natural history, ecology, and outdoor life in and around the Boundary Waters.\n\nOn August 27, 1971, a little over a year after the celebration of the first Earth Day, Northland College hosted its first environmental conference. Among those invited to address the two-day conference were Senator Gaylord Nelson and Sigurd Olson. The conference became \"the instrument of origin of the Sigurd Olson Environmental Institute,\" as Robert Matteson, the founder of the Institute, wrote. With energy to move in a new and exciting direction, and guided by the philosophies of Sigurd Olson, the Institute opened its doors in spring of 1972, embarking on more than 30 years of serving Northland College and the Lake Superior region.\n\nIn 1974, Olson earned the John Burroughs Medal, the highest honor in nature writing. He died on January 13, 1982 of a heart attack while snowshoeing near his home. He received a tribute from the US Senate on the 100th anniversary of his birth.\n\nOlson was influential in the protection of the Boundary Waters and helped draft the Wilderness Act of 1964, becoming vice-president of The Wilderness Society from 1963 to 1967 and President 1968 to 1971. He also helped establish Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota, Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and Point Reyes National Seashore in California. Sigurd also was a consultant to the Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall on wilderness and national park issues.\n\nAfter over 50 years of hard work, Sigurd reached his goal. Full wilderness status was granted to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness by Jimmy Carter in 1978, four years before Sigurd died. His hard work was commemorated in many different ways, including in the naming of a central building of YMCA Camp Widjiwagan, located on nearby Burntside Lake.\n\nOlson was President of the National Parks Association and a member of its Board of Trustees.\n\n\n\n"}

Because a new bird atlas was started in southern Africa in 2007, the earlier project is now referred to as SABAP1. The new atlas project is known as the Second Southern African Bird Atlas Project, and is abbreviated to SABAP2.\n\nSABAP covered six countries: Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. At the time, Mozambique was engulfed in a civil war, and had to be excluded. The resolution for SABAP1 was the quarter degree grid cell (QDGC), 15 minutes of latitude by 15 minutes of longitude, 27.4 km north-south and about 25 km east-west, an area of about 700 km². However, in Botswana a half degree grid cell was used. The total number of grid cells, taking account of the coarser resolution in Botswana, was 3973. Fieldwork was conducted mainly in the five-year period 1987–1991, but the project coordinators included all suitable data collected from 1980–1987. In some areas, particularly those that were remote and inaccessible, data collection continued until 1993.\n\nFieldwork was undertaken mainly by birders, and most of it was done on a volunteer basis. Fieldwork consisted of compiling bird lists for the QDGCs. All the checklists were fully captured into a database. The final dataset consisted of 147 605 checklists, containing a total of 7.3 million records of bird distribution. Of the total 3973 QDGCs, only 88 had no checklists (2.2% of the total).\n\nProject coordination was undertaken by the Avian Demography Unit (ADU) at the University of Cape Town. The unit changed its name in 2008 to Animal Demography Unit, to reflect its expanding ambit, but retained the acronym ADU.\n\nThe final product of the project was a two-volume set of A4-sized books, covering 932 species, with a total of 1500 pages, published in 1997 by BirdLife South Africa. The books are now out of print, but the individual species texts are available on the SABAP2 website. Volume 1 also contains a chapter on the relevance of southern African geography to birds. \"The Atlas of Southern African Birds\" was, at the time of publication, the largest biodiversity project ever conducted in Africa. This project showed that birdlife in southern Africa reflects the wide diversity of habitats in the region: 9% of the world's bird species are regularly found there, even though it constitutes only 1.67% of the world's land area. \n\nThe impact of the project on southern African ornithology was considerable. The species texts did not only provide information on distribution, but also presented new information and analyses on the seasonality of breeding and the direction and seasonality of migration. SABAP therefore became an essential reference for all research involving these fundamental aspects of avian biology. It provided much of the information upon which the Important Bird Area selection process in southern Africa was based, and for the IUCN Red List for birds in South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland.\n"}

It serves as the principal regulatory institution in the sphere of alternative and renewable energy in the Republic of Azerbaijan. The State Agency is headed by Akim Badalov.\n\nThe State Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources (SAARES) was established following a Presidential Decree in July 16, 2009 as a part of the Ministry of Industry and Energy.\n\nThe main purpose is to provide the country with alternative sources of energy. Before the foundation of the Agency, there was “State Program on alternative and renewable energy sources in the Republic of Azerbaijan” approved by Decree No 462 of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan in October, 2004.\n\nAccording to the Decree of the President of Azerbaijan Republic Ilham Aliyev in 2012 the agency was liquidated and instead the State Company on Azerbaijan Republic on Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources (ABEMDA) was founded.\n\nIn 2011 President Ilham Aliyev planned a second government strategy on alternative and renewable energy sources for the years 2012-2020. Targets according to strategy:\n\n\nThe State Program on Use of Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources in Azerbaijan Republic:\n\n\nThe agency is headed by its director Akim Badalov and it resides in the Government House in Baku.\n\nThe Agency has the mandate of the principal regulatory institution in the sphere of alternative and renewable energy and is tasked with assessment of sustainable energy potential, shaping relevant policies, including tariff policy, elaboration and enforcement of relevant procedures such as issue of special permissions to the public and private entities to construct power generation facilities.\n\n\nIn spring 2011, SAARES in cooperation with UNDP launched a new project on ‘Promoting Development of Sustainable Energy in Azerbaijan’. This project became possible with the financial support of €500,000 provided by the European Commission and $790,000 contributed by the Government of Norway.\n\nAzerbaijan’s energy production is currently largely reliant on the exploitation of the country’s hydrocarbon reserves and while the development of renewable energy is one of the government’s strategic priorities, the legal and institutional environment are not yet attractive for potential investors. This project aims to assist the Government of Azerbaijan to overcome those barriers by reviewing and amending existing legal and institutional frameworks. The implementation of this project will be a significant step in contributing to achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in Azerbaijan.\n\nA new wind plan called Yeni Yashma was built by Agency in 2015. Its capacity was to generate 50 MW. The plant is expected to be put into service by the end of this year.\n\nAzerbaijan plans to use the windy Caspian Sea in order to expand its alternative energy potential. Wind farms will be built offshore in an area marked by great winds.\n\nNowadays the total capacity of power generation in the country is 7.2 thousand megawatts. Azerbaijan is able to produce about 24 billion kilowatt-hours and export 2.1 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity every year.\n\nThere are tariffs for alternative energy depending on the region in Azerbaijan.\n\nSince 2000, approximately 800 million manats have been invested in this sphere.\n\nAccording to statistics, 9 per cent of the electricity generated in Azerbaijan in 2011 came from renewable sources, nearly entirely from hydro-electric power.\n\nIn 2014 the volume of investments made in the development of the alternative energy sphere in Azerbaijan reached 63.6 million manat. The majority of this volume, nearly 34.9 million manat, was allocated to the development of the solar energy sphere, another 28.7 million manat went toward wind power.\n\nThe public fund of Azerbaijan invested 127 million manats in the development of alternative and renewable energy sources.\n\nThe total capacity of alternative and renewable energy sources in the country is more than 12,000 megawatts. 4,500 MW of them fall on wind energy, biomass – 1,500 MW, geothermal energy – 800 MW, 350 MW - small hydro power plants.\n\nIt’s planned to increase the share of alternative energy in total production to 20 percent by 2020. A third of them will come from the wind energy. It requires 6.7 billion USD of investment.\n\nAzerbaijan is supported by Germany in the development of wind power. Also, it’s planned to build a solar power plant in Germany in the near future. The capacity of the plant will be approximately 10 megawatts. Works in this domain go on in Turkey too.\n\nState Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources (SAARES) collaborates with United Nations Development Program.\n\nIn 2009, USAID assisted to develop a preferential tariff to speed the development of wind power in Azerbaijan.\n\n\n\nState Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources (Azerbaijan)\n\n"}

According to Eric Donovan's analysis of satellite data from the European Space Agency's Swarm mission, Steve is caused by a wide ribbon of hot gases at an altitude of , with a temperature of and flowing at a speed of (compared to outside the ribbon). The phenomenon is not rare, but nobody had looked into it in detail prior to that. In August 2018, researchers determined that the phenomenon's skyglow was not associated with particle precipitation (electrons or ions) and, as a result, could be generated in the ionosphere.\n\nThe aurora watchers who first discovered Steve, members of a Facebook group called Alberta Aurora Chasers, initially attributed the phenomenon to a proton aurora and erroneously called them \"proton arcs\", but when physics professor Eric Donovan from the University of Calgary saw the pictures, he suspected that was not the case, because proton auroras are not visible. As he correlated the time and location of the phenomenon with Swarm satellite data, and Song Despins photo (not seen here) including GPS coordinates, the phenomenon was very clearly distinguished.\n\nOne of the aurora watchers, photographer Chris Ratzlaff, suggested the name \"Steve\" from \"Over the Hedge\", an animated comedy movie from 2006, in which its characters chose that name for something unknown. Reportage of the heretofore undescribed unusual \"aurora\" went viral as an example of citizen science on Aurorasaurus.\n\nA scientist listening to Eric Donovan's presentation at the December, 2016, meeting of the American Geophysical Union suggested \"Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement\" as a backronym of STEVE, one which has since been adopted by the team at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center studying Steve.\n\nSteve can be spotted closer to the equator than the aurora, and as of March 2018 has been observed in the United Kingdom, Canada, Alaska, northern U.S. states and New Zealand. Steve appears as a very narrow arc extending for hundreds or thousands of miles, aligned east-west. Steve generally lasts for 20 minutes to an hour. As of March 2018, Steve has only been spotted in the presence of an aurora. Steve was not observed from October 2016 to February 2017, or from October 2017 to February 2018, leading NASA to believe that Steve may only appear in certain seasons.\n\nA study published in March 2018 by Donovan, Ratzlaff, and other co-authors in the peer-reviewed journal \"Science Advances\" suggested that Steve accompanies a subauroral ion drift (SAID), a fast-moving stream of extremely hot particles. Steve marks the first observed visual effect accompanying a SAID. In August 2018, researchers determined that the phenomenon's skyglow was not associated with particle precipitation (electrons or ions) and, as a result, could be generated in the ionosphere.\n\n\n"}

The phenomenon consists of a sudden rotation of cold southern winds to the south-east. This change, while moderating the cold temperatures, loads the air masses with oceanic humidity, bringing heavy rain and rough seas in the coastal regions. The air circulation also increases the intensity of the winds. The \"Sudestada\" is most likely to happen between July and October.\n\nA sudestada may take place with or (less commonly) without precipitation. The latter is caused by a high pressure system, centered on the southwest of Buenos Aires Province in Argentina, bringing persistent winds to the mouth of the Río de la Plata.\n\nA sudestada with rain, on the other hand, is generated by the combined effect of two systems: a high pressure on located on the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of central Patagonia, which brings cold sea air to the east of Buenos Aires Province and the south of the Argentine littoral and Uruguay, and a low pressure system, located over the center-south of Argentine Mesopotamia and western Uruguay, which brings hot, humid air to the same region. As the pressure in the latter system drops, winds from the southeast increase.\n\n\n"}

Tilatarpana is a specific form of Tarpana involving libations offered to the Pitrs (deceased ancestors) using water and sesame seeds during Pitru Paksha or as a death rite.\n\n(i) Tarpana means Arghya, an offering.

Lord Ganesha is commonly offered pancha-kajjaya, a delicacy made using sesame. Lord Shiva is worshipped with sesame seeds (tilakshata). For Lord Vishnu, Lord Brahma, Goddess Laxmi and Goddess Saraswati, Gingelly seeds are used in any of their favorite eatables and offered to bestow their special favors on the worshippers. Besides, it is used as a homa dravya (an ingredient in the fire offerings) in many havans and homas. Therefore, tila (Gingelly) and tilatarpana should not be decried as inauspicious.\n\nIt is believed that one’s pitrus will be eagerly awaiting for tarpana on all the above-mentioned occasions.
