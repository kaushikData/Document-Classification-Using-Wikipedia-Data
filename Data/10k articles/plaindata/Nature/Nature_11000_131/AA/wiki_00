{"id": "166371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166371", "title": "Baroclinity", "text": "Baroclinity\n\nIn fluid dynamics, the baroclinity (often called baroclinicity) of a stratified fluid is a measure of how misaligned the gradient of pressure is from the gradient of density in a fluid. In meteorology a baroclinic atmosphere is one for which the density depends on both the temperature and the pressure; contrast this with a barotropic atmosphere, for which the density depends only on the pressure. In atmospheric terms, the barotropic zones of the Earth are generally found in the central latitudes, or tropics, whereas the baroclinic areas are generally found in the mid-latitude/polar regions.\n\nBaroclinity is proportional to:\n\nwhich is proportional to the sine of the angle between surfaces of constant pressure and surfaces of constant density. Thus, in a \"barotropic\" fluid (which is defined by zero baroclinity), these surfaces are parallel.\n\nAreas of high atmospheric baroclinity are characterized by the frequent formation of cyclones.\n\nBaroclinic instability is a fluid dynamical instability of fundamental importance in the atmosphere and in the oceans. In the atmosphere it is the dominant mechanism shaping the cyclones and anticyclones that dominate weather in mid-latitudes. In the ocean it generates a field of mesoscale (100 km or smaller) eddies that play various roles in oceanic dynamics and the transport of tracers. Baroclinic instability is a concept relevant to \"rapidly rotating\", \"strongly stratified\" fluids.\n\nWhether a fluid counts as \"rapidly rotating\" is determined in this context by the Rossby number, which is a measure of how close the flow is to solid body rotation. More precisely, a flow in solid body rotation has vorticity that is proportional to its angular velocity. The Rossby number is a measure of the departure of the vorticity from that of solid body rotation. The Rossby number must be small for the concept of baroclinic instability to be relevant. When the Rossby number is large, other kinds of instabilities, often referred to as inertial, become more relevant.\n\nThe simplest example of a stably stratified flow is an incompressible flow with density decreasing with height.\n\nIn a compressible gas such as the atmosphere, the relevant measure is the vertical gradient of the entropy, which must increase with height for the flow to be stably stratified.\n\nThe strength of the stratification is measured by asking how large the vertical shear of the horizontal winds has to be in order to destabilize the flow and produce the classic Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. This measure is called the \"Richardson number\". When the Richardson number is large, the stratification is strong enough to prevent this shear instability.\nBefore the classic work of Jule Charney and Eric Eady on baroclinic instability in the late 1940s, most theories trying to explain the structure of mid-latitude eddies took as their starting points the high Rossby number or small Richardson number instabilities familiar to fluid dynamicists at that time. The most important feature of baroclinic instability is that it exists even in the situation of rapid rotation (small Rossby number) and strong stable stratification (large Richardson's number) typically observed in the atmosphere.\n\nThe energy source for baroclinic instability is the potential energy in the environmental flow. As the instability grows, the center of mass of the fluid is lowered. \nIn growing waves in the atmosphere, cold air moving downwards and equatorwards displaces the warmer air moving polewards and upwards.\n\nBaroclinic instability can be investigated in the laboratory using a rotating, fluid filled annulus. The annulus is heated at the outer wall and cooled at the inner wall, and the resulting fluid flows give rise to baroclinically unstable waves.\n\nThe term \"baroclinic\" refers to the mechanism by which vorticity is generated. Vorticity is the curl of the velocity field. In general, the evolution of vorticity can be broken into contributions from advection (as vortex tubes move with the flow), stretching and twisting (as vortex tubes are pulled or twisted by the flow) and baroclinic vorticity generation, which occurs whenever there is a density gradient along surfaces of constant pressure. Baroclinic flows can be contrasted with barotropic flows in which density and pressure surfaces coincide and there is no baroclinic generation of vorticity.\n\nThe study of the evolution of these baroclinic instabilities as they grow and then decay is a crucial part of developing theories for the fundamental characteristics of midlatitude weather.\n\nBeginning with the equation of motion for a frictionless fluid (the Euler equations) and taking the curl, one arrives at the equation of motion for the curl of the fluid velocity, that is to say, the vorticity.\n\nIn a fluid that is not all of the same density, a source term appears in the vorticity equation whenever surfaces of constant density (isopycnic surfaces) and surfaces\nof constant pressure (isobaric surfaces) are not aligned. The material derivative of the local vorticity is given by:\n\n(where formula_3 is the velocity and formula_4 is the vorticity, formula_5 is pressure, and formula_6 is density). The baroclinic contribution is the vector:\n\nThis vector, sometimes called the solenoidal vector, is of interest both in compressible fluids and in incompressible (but inhomogeneous) fluids. Internal gravity waves as well as unstable Rayleigh–Taylor modes can be analyzed from the perspective of the baroclinic vector. It is also of interest in the creation of vorticity by the passage of shocks through inhomogeneous media, such as in the Richtmyer–Meshkov instability.\n\nExperienced divers are familiar with the very slow waves that can be excited at a thermocline or a halocline, which are known as \"internal waves\". Similar waves can be generated between a layer of water and a layer of oil. When the interface between these two surfaces is not horizontal and the system is close to hydrostatic equilibrium, the gradient of the pressure is vertical but the gradient of the density is not. Therefore the baroclinic vector is nonzero, and the sense of the baroclinic vector is to create vorticity to make the interface level out. In the process, the interface overshoots, and the result is an oscillation which is an internal gravity wave. Unlike surface gravity waves, internal gravity waves do not require a sharp interface. For example, in bodies of water, a gradual gradient in temperature or salinity is sufficient to support internal gravity waves driven by the baroclinic vector.\n\n"}

{"id": "18451259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18451259", "title": "Cultural depictions of elephants", "text": "Cultural depictions of elephants\n\nElephants have been depicted in mythology, symbolism and popular culture. They are both revered in religion and respected for their prowess in war. They also have negative connotations such as being a symbol for an unnecessary burden. Ever since the stone age, when elephants were represented by ancient petroglyphs and cave art, they have been portrayed in various forms of art, including pictures, sculptures, music, film, and even architecture.\n\n \nThe Asian elephant appears in various religious traditions and mythologies. They are treated positively and are sometimes revered as deities, often symbolising strength and wisdom. Similarly, the African elephant is seen as the wise chief who impartially settles disputes among the forest creatures in African fables, and the Ashanti tradition holds that they are human chiefs from the past.\n\nThe Earth is supported and guarded by mythical World Elephants at the compass points of the cardinal directions, according to the Hindu cosmology of ancient India. The classical Sanskrit literature also attributes earthquakes to the shaking of their bodies when they tire. Wisdom is represented by the elephant in the form of the deity Ganesh, one of the most popular gods in the Hindu religion's pantheon. Sometimes known as Ganesha, this deity is very distinctive in having a human form with the head of an elephant. This was put on after the human head was either was cut off or burned, depending on the version of the story from various Hindu sources. Lord Ganesha's birthday (rebirth) is celebrated as the Hindu festival known as Ganesha Chaturthi. In Japanese Buddhism, their adaptation of Ganesha is known as Kangiten (\"Deva of Bliss\"), often represented as an elephant-headed male and female pair shown in a standing embrace to represent unity of opposites.\n\nIn Hindu iconography, many \"devas\" are associated with a mount or vehicle known as a \"vāhana\". In addition to providing a means of transport, they symbolically represent a divine attribute. The elephant \"vāhana\" represents wisdom, divine knowledge and royal power; it is associated with Lakshmi, Brihaspati, Shachi and Indra.\nIndra was said to ride on a flying white elephant named Airavata, who was made the King of all elephants by Lord Indra. A white elephant is rare and given special significance. It is often considered sacred and symbolises royalty in Thailand and Burma, where it is also considered a symbol of good luck. In Buddhist iconography, the elephant is associated with Queen Māyā of Sakya, the mother of Gautama Buddha. She had a vivid dream foretelling her pregnancy in which a white elephant featured prominently. To the royal sages, the white elephant signifies royal majesty and authority; they interpreted the dream as meaning that her child was destined for greatness as a universal monarch or a \"buddha\".\n\nElephants remain an integral part of religion in South Asia and some are even featured in various religious practices. Temple elephants are specially trained captive elephants that are lavishly caparisoned and used in various temple activities. Among the most famous of the temple elephants is Guruvayur Keshavan of Kerala, India. They are also used in festivals in Sri Lanka such as the Esala Perahera.\n\nIn the version of the Chinese zodiac used in Northern Thailand, the last year in the 12-year cycle – called \"Year of the Pig\" in China – is known instead as \"Year of the Elephant\", reflecting the importance of elephants in Thai culture.\nIn Islamic tradition, the year 570 is when the Prophet Muhammad was born and is known as the Year of the Elephant. In that year, Abraha, ruler of Yemen tried to conquer Mecca and demolish the Kaaba, reportedly in retaliation for the previous Meccan defilement of Al–Qalis Church in Sana'a, a cathedral Abraha had constructed. However, his plan was foiled when his white elephant named Mahmud refused to cross the boundary of Mecca. The elephant, who led Abraha's forty thousand men, could not be persuaded with reason or even with violence, which was regarded as a crucial omen by Abraha's soldiers. This is generally related in the five verses of the chapter titled 'The Elephant' in the Quran.\nIn the Judeo-Christian tradition, medieval artists depicted the mutual killing of both Eleazar the Maccabee and a war elephant carrying an important Seleucid general as described in the apocryphal book of 1 Maccabees. The early illustrators knew little of the elephant and their portrayals are highly inaccurate.\n\nThe unfamiliarity with the exotic beast has also made elephants a subject of widely different interpretations thus giving rise to mythological creatures. The story of the blind men and an elephant was written to show how reality may be viewed from differing perspectives. The source of this parable is unknown, but it appears to have originated in India. It has been attributed to Buddhists, Hindus, Jainists, and Sufis, and was also used by Discordians. The scattered skulls of prehistoric dwarf elephants, on the islands of Crete and Sicily may have formed the basis of belief in existence of cyclopes, the one-eyed giants featured in Homer's Odyssey (c. 800~600 BC). As early as the 1370s, scholars had noted that the skulls feature a large nasal cavity at the front that could be mistaken for a singular eye socket; and the skulls, twice the size of a human's, looked as if they could belong to giant humanoids. It is also suggested that the Behemoth described in the Book of Job may be the elephant due to its grazing habits and preference to rivers.\n\nFrom Stone age rock-art to Modern age street-art, the elephant has remained a popular subject for artists.\n\nPrehistoric North Africans depicted the elephant in Paleolithic age rock art. For example, the Libyan Tadrart Acacus, a UNESCO World Heritage site, features a rock carving of an elephant from the last phase of the Pleistocene epoch (12,000–8000 BC) rendered with remarkable realism. There are many other prehistoric examples, including Neolithic rock art of south Oran (Algeria), and a white elephant rock painting in 'Phillip's Cave' by the San in the Erongo region of Namibia. From the Bovidian period (3550–3070 BCE), elephant images by the San bushmen in the South African Cederberg Wilderness Area suggest to researchers that they had \"a symbolic association with elephants\" and \"had a deep understanding of the communication, behaviour and social structure of elephant family units\" and \"possibly developed a symbiotic relationship with elephants that goes back thousands of years.\"\n\nIndian rock reliefs include a number of depictions of elephants, notably the \"Descent of the Ganges\" at Mahabalipuram, a large 7th-century Hindu scene with many figures that uses the form of the rock to shape the image. At Unakoti, Tripura there is an 11th-century group of reliefs related to Shiva, including several elephants.\n\nIndian painting includes many elephants, especially ones ridden for battle and royal transport in Mughal miniatures.\n\nElephants are often featured in modern artistic works, including those by artists such as Norman Rockwell, Andy Warhol and Banksy. The stork-legged elephant, found in many of Salvador Dalí's works, is one of the surrealist's best known Icons, and adorn the walls of the Dalí Museum in Spain.\n\nThe elephant is also depicted by various political groups and in secular society.\n\nAsian cultures admire the high intelligence and good memory of Asian elephants. As such, they symbolise wisdom and royal power. They are used as a representative of various political parties such as United National Party of Sri Lanka and Bahujan Samaj Party of India. The Elephants of Kerala are an integral part of the daily life in Kerala, South India. These Indian elephants are loved, revered, groomed and given a prestigious place in the state's culture. There they are often referred to as the 'sons of the \"sahya\".' The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the Government of Kerala. The elephant is also on the flag of the Kingdom of Laos with three elephants visible, supporting an umbrella (another symbol of royal power) until it became a republic in 1975. Other Southeast Asian realms have also displayed one or more white elephants.\n\nThe elephant also lends its name to some landmarks in Asia. Elephanta Island (also called \"Gharapuri Island\") in Mumbai Harbour was given this name by 17th century Portuguese explorers who saw a monolithic basalt sculpture of an elephant near the entrance to what became known as the Elephanta Caves. The Portuguese attempted to take it home with them but ended up dropping it into the sea because their chains were not strong enough. Later, the British moved this elephant to the Victoria and Albert Museum (now Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum) in Mumbai.\n\nAside from being a curiosity for Europeans, the elephant also became a symbol of military might from the experience of fighting foreign powers that fielded war elephants throughout history. After Alexander the Great's victory over King Porus of India, the captured war elephants became a symbol of imperial power, being used as an emblem of the Seleucid Diadoch empire. Later, when Napoleon Bonaparte wanted a monument to his own imperial power, he decreed that a colossal bronze elephant fountain be cast from guns captured at his victorious Battle of Friedland, for the site where the Bastille once stood.\n\nThe Order of the Elephant () is the highest order of Denmark. This very select religious organization was founded by King Christian I in 1478, using the elephant as a symbol of docility, sobriety and piety; instituted in its current form in 1693 by King Christian V.\nThe killing and eating of the elephants Castor and Pollux from the Botanical gardens during the 1870 Siege of Paris received considerable attention at the time. This became emblematic of the hardships and degradation caused by siege and war, especially since the two elephants were previously very popular with the Parisian public.\n\nThe city of Catania, Sicily has an immemorial connection with the elephant. The local sorcerer Heliodorus, was credited with either riding a magic elephant or transforming himself into this animal. Under Medieval Arab rule Catania was known as \"Medinat-Al-Fil\" or \"Balad-Al-Fil\" (City/State of the Elephant). The symbol of the city is the \"Fontana dell'Elefante\" (Fountain of the Elephant) assembled in its present form in 1736 by Giovanni Battista Vaccarini.\nIn Central London, England, an area known as the \"Elephant and Castle\" (or \"The Elephant\") is centered on a major road intersection and a station of the London Underground. The \"Castle\" in the location's name refers to a medieval perception of a Howdah. The heraldic elephant and castle has also been associated with the city of Coventry, England since medieval times, where it denotes religious symbolism and with the town of Dumbarton, Scotland. More recently in Britain, Welephant, a red elephant cartoon character with a fireman's helmet, was originally used as a mascot by fire brigades in the United Kingdom to promote fire safety for children and has become the mascot for the Children's Burn Trust.\n\nThe elephant as the symbol for the Republican Party of the United States originated in an 1874 political cartoon of an Asian elephant by Thomas Nast in \"Harper's Weekly\". This cartoon, titled \"Third Term Panic\", is a parody of Aesop's fable, \"The Ass in the Lion's Skin\". It depicts an elephant (labelled \"The Republican Vote\") running toward a \"chasm of chaos\"; frightening a jackass in a lion's skin (labelled \"Caesarism\") which scatters animals representing various interests. Although Nast used the elephant seven more times to represent the \"Republican Vote\", he did not use it to represent the \"Republican Party\" until March 1884 in \"The Sacred Elephant\".\n\nMany African cultures revere the African Elephant as a symbol of strength and power. It is also praised for its size, longevity, stamina, mental faculties, cooperative spirit, and loyalty. South Africa, uses elephant tusks in their coat of arms to represent wisdom, strength, moderation and eternity. The elephant is symbolically important to the nation of Ivory Coast (\"Côte d'Ivoire\"); the Coat of arms of Ivory Coast features an elephant head escutcheon as its focal point.\n\nIn the western African Kingdom of Dahomey (now part of Benin) the elephant was associated with the 19th century rulers of the Fon people, Guezo and his son Glele. The animal is believed to evoke strength, royal legacy, and enduring memory as related by the proverbs: \"\"There where the elephant passes in the forest, one knows\" and \"The animal steps on the ground, but the elephant steps down with strength\".\" Their flag depicted an elephant wearing a royal crown.\n\nThe elephant has entered into popular culture through various idiomatic expressions and adages.\n\nThe phrase \"Elephants never forget\" refers to the belief that elephants have excellent memories. The variation \"Women and elephants never forget an injury\" originates from the 1904 book \"Reginald on Besetting Sins\" by British writer Hector Hugh Munro, better known as Saki.\n\nThis adage seems to have a basis in fact, as reported in \"Scientific American\":\n\n\"Seeing the Elephant\" is a 19th-century Americanism denoting a world-weary experience; often used by soldiers, pioneers and adventurers to qualify new and exciting adventures such as the Civil War, the Oregon Trail and the California Gold Rush. A \"white elephant\" has become a term referring to an expensive burden, particularly when much has been invested with false expectations. The term 'white elephant sale' was sometimes used in Australia as a synonym for jumble sale. In the U.S., a White elephant gift exchange is a popular winter holiday party activity. The idiom Elephant in the room tells of an obvious truth that no one wants to discuss, alluding to the animal's size compared to a small space. \"Seeing pink elephants\" refers to a drunken hallucination and is the basis for the Pink Elephants on Parade sequence in the 1941 Disney animated feature, \"Dumbo\". \"Jumbo\" has entered the English language as a synonym for \"large\". Jumbo originally was the name of a huge elephant acquired by circus showman P. T. Barnum from the London Zoo in 1882. The name itself may have come from a West African native word for \"elephant\".\n\nThe elephant is viewed in both positive and negative lights in similar fashion as humans in various forms of literature. In fact, Pliny the Elder praised the beast in his \"Naturalis Historia\" as one that is closest to a human in sensibilities. The elephant's different connotations clash in Ivo Andrić's novella \"The Vizier's Elephant\". Here the citizens of Travnik despise the young elephant who symbolises the cruelty of the unseen Vizier. However, the elephant itself is young and innocent despite unknowingly causing havoc due to youthful play. In the Tarzan novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs, \"Tantor\" is the generic term for \"elephant\" in the fictional simian \"Mangani\" language, but is associated with a particular elephant who eventually becomes Tarzan's faithful companion. Other elephant characters that are shown in a positive light include Jean de Brunhoff's Babar and Dr. Seuss' Horton. Jules Verne featured a steam-powered mechanical elephant in his 1880 novel \"The Steam House\". In addition, the animal is depicted in its military use through the oliphaunts of J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy and the alien invaders of Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's 1985 science fiction novel, \"Footfall\".\n\nNotable short stories featuring elephants include Rudyard Kipling's \"Toomai of the Elephants\" and \"The Elephant's Child\"; as well as Mark Twain's \"The Stolen White Elephant\". George Orwell wrote an allegorical essay, \"Shooting an Elephant\"; and in \"Hills Like White Elephants\", Ernest Hemingway used the allegorical white elephant, alluding to a pregnancy as an unwanted gift.\n\nThe animal is also seen in historical novels. \"The Elephant's Journey\" (Portuguese: \"A Viagem do Elefante\", 2008) is a novel by Nobel laureate José Saramago. This is a fictional account based on an historical 16th century journey from Lisbon to Vienna by an elephant named Solomon. \"An Elephant for Aristotle\" is a 1958 historical novel by L. Sprague de Camp. It concerns the adventures of a Thessalian cavalry commander who has been tasked by Alexander the Great to bring an elephant captured from King Porus of India, to Athens as a present for Alexander's old tutor, Aristotle.\n\nElephants can also represent the hugeness and wildness of the imagination, as in Ursula Dubosarsky's 2012 children's book, \"Too Many Elephants in This House\", which also plays with the notion of the elephant in the room. An imaginary elephant can (perhaps) become real, as with the elusive Heffalump. Although never specified as an elephant in A. A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh stories, a heffalump physically resembles an elephant; and E. H. Shepard's illustration shows an Indian elephant. \"Heffalump\" has since been defined as \"a child's term for an elephant.\"\n\nThe elephant is used as a mascot or logo for various sports groups.\n\nCircus showman P. T. Barnum donated the stuffed hide of Jumbo the elephant to Tufts University's in 1885, where Jumbo soon became the mascot for their sports teams. However, all that remains of Jumbo are some ashes stored in a peanut butter jar and a piece of his tail following a fire in 1975. \"Jumbo's spirit lives on\" in the peanut butter jar which is ceremoniously passed on to successive Athletic Directors.\n\nThe mascot for the Oakland Athletics (A's) baseball team is based on the figurative white elephant. The story of picking the mascot began when New York Giants' manager John McGraw told reporters that Philadelphia manufacturer Benjamin Shibe, who owned the controlling interest in the new team, had a \"white elephant on his hands\"; manager Connie Mack defiantly adopted the white elephant as the team mascot. The A's are sometimes, but infrequently, referred to as the 'Elephants' or 'White Elephants'. Their mascot is nicknamed Stomper.\n\nUniversity of Alabama's Crimson Tide mascot has been an elephant since 1930 after a sportswriter wrote of a fan yelling \"Hold your horses, the elephants are coming!\" as the football team rumbled onto the field. Their elephant-costumed \"Big Al\" officially debuted at the 1979 Sugar Bowl.\n\nCatania, Italy uses the elephant to represent their football team, referencing the animal that has represented their city since ancient times.\n\nThe elephant is also represented in music such as Henry Mancini's hit song \"Baby Elephant Walk\", which has been described as \"musical shorthand for kookiness of any stripe\". The American band the White Stripes' fourth album was entitled \"Elephant \"in honour of the animal's brute strength and closeness to its relatives. The hit single \"Elephant\" by British recording artist Alexandra Burke is based on the expression \"elephant in the room\". \"Nellie the Elephant\" is a children's song first released in 1956 and since covered by many artists including the punk-rock band Toy Dolls;\n\nThe elephant is also featured in film and on television. Thailand has produced various movies about the animal, from the 1940 historical drama film \"King of the White Elephant\" to the 2005 martial-arts action film, \"Tom-Yum-Goong\". In the West, the elephant was popularised by \"Dumbo\", the elephant who learns to fly in the 1941 Disney animated feature of the same name. Kipling's \"Toomai of the Elephants\" was adapted as the 1937 British adventure film \"Elephant Boy\". In popular modern films, Tai the elephant-actress has portrayed Bo Tat in \"Operation Dumbo Drop\" (1995), Vera in \"Larger than Life\" (1996) and Rosie in \"Water for Elephants\" (2011).\n\nOn television, \"Nellie the Elephant\" is a 1990 UK cartoon series inspired by the song of the same name, featuring Scottish singer Lulu voicing Nelly. Britt Allcroft adapted \"Mumfie\" the elephant from Katherine Tozer's series of children's books, originally in a '70s televised puppet show and then in the '90s animated \"Magic Adventures of Mumfie\" series.\n\nThe elephant can also be found in games. In shatranj, the medieval game from which chess developed, the piece corresponding to the modern bishop was known as \"Pil\" or \"Alfil\" (\"Elephant\"; from Persian and Arabic, respectively). In the Indian chaturanga game the piece is also called \"Elephant\" (\"Gaja\"). The same is true in Chinese chess, which has an elephant piece (\"Xiàng\", 象) that serves as a defensive piece, being the only one that may not cross the river dividing the game board. In the Japanese shogi version, the piece was known as the \"\"Drunken\" Elephant\"; however, it was dropped by order of the Emperor Go-Nara and no longer appears in the version played in contemporary Japan. Even with modern Chess, the word for the bishop is still \"Alfil\" in Spanish, \"Alfiere\" in Italian, \"Feel\" in Persian, and \"Elephant\" (Слон) in Russian. All of these games originally simulated a kind of battlefield, thus this piece represented a war elephant. In the present-day canonical Staunton chess set, the piece's deep groove, which originally represented the elephant's tusks, is now regarded as representing a bishop's (or abbot's) mitre. The Asian subspecie was included in Far Cry 4's handbook, comparing the animal to Pagan Min's nobility and humility.\n\nIn the 18th-century, French architect Charles Ribart planned to build a three-level elephant building at the Paris site where the Arc de Triomphe was eventually built. Nothing became of this, but in the early 19th-century, Napoleon conceived of an even larger elephant structure, the Elephant of the Bastille. Although the ambitious project was never completed with its intended bronze elephant, a full-sized plaster and wood-frame model stood in its place. After Napoleon's defeat, this structure eventually became a neglected eyesore, and a setting in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel, \"Les Misérables\".\n\nThree multi-story elephant shaped buildings were built in America by James V. Lafferty in the 1880s. The largest, seven-story, thirty-one room Elephantine Colossus served as a hotel, concert hall, and attraction on Coney Island before it burned down in 1896. The six-story Lucy the Elephant is the only remaining of the three, and survives as a tourist attraction near Atlantic City. These giant elephant structures, however, are dwarfed by the 32-story Bangkok Elephant Tower in Thailand. This iconic elephant-inspired building reflects the influence of the elephant in Thai culture.\n\n\n\n"}

The primary function of this technology is to produce maps that give accurate representations of a particular area, detailing major road arteries and other points of interest. The technology also allows the calculation of distances from one place to another.\n\nAlthough digital mapping can be found in a variety of computer applications the main use of these maps is with the Global Positioning System, or GPS satellite network, used in standard automotive navigation systems.\n\nThe roots of digital mapping lie within traditional paper maps such as the Thomas Guide and Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas. Paper maps provide basic landscapes similar to digitized road maps, yet are often cumbersome, cover only a designated area, and lack many specific details such as road blocks. In addition, there is no way to “update” a paper map except to obtain a new version. On the other hand, digital maps, in many cases, can be updated through synchronization with updates from company servers.\n\nEarly digital maps had the same basic functionality as paper maps—that is, they provided a “virtual view” of roads generally outlined by the terrain encompassing the surrounding area. However, as digital maps have grown with the expansion of GPS technology in the past decade, live traffic updates, points of interest and service locations have been added to enhance digital maps to be more “user conscious.\" Traditional “virtual views” are now only part of digital mapping. In many cases, users can choose between virtual maps, satellite (aerial views), and hybrid (a combination of virtual map and aerial views) views. With the ability to update and expand digital mapping devices, newly constructed roads and places can be added to appear on maps. Three-dimensional maps of landscapes can be generated using 3D scanners or 3D reconstruction software.\n\nDigital maps heavily rely upon a vast amount of data collected over time. Most of the information that comprise digital maps is the culmination of satellite imagery as well as street level information. Maps must be updated frequently to provide users with the most accurate reflection of a location. While there is a wide spectrum on companies that specialize in digital mapping, the basic premise is that digital maps will accurately portray roads as they actually appear to give \"life-like experiences.\" \n\nProprietary and non-proprietary computer programs and applications provide imagery and street-level map data for much of the world.\n\nThe development of mobile computing (PDAs, tablet PCs, laptops, etc.) has recently (since about 2000) spurred the use of digital mapping in the sciences and applied sciences. , science fields that use digital mapping technology include geology (see Digital geologic mapping), engineering, architecture, land surveying, mining, forestry, environmental, and archaeology.\n\nThe principal use by which digital mapping has grown in the past decade has been its connection to Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. GPS is the foundation behind digital mapping navigation systems.\n\nThe coordinates and position as well as atomic time obtained by a terrestrial GPS receiver from GPS satellites orbiting Earth interact together to provide the digital mapping programming with points of origin in addition to the destination points needed to calculate distance. This information is then analyzed and compiled to create a map that provides the easiest and most efficient way to reach a destination.\n\n"}

To be in this state, the system pays a certain cost in terms of energy required by the state. This energy is a scalar quantity, a function of the state, hence the term \"functional\". The system tends to develop from the state with higher energy (higher cost) to the state with lower energy, thus local minima of this functional are usually related to the stable stationary states.

It also consists of different ecoregions, which represent the natural geographical ecosystem, water systems, weather, renewable resources and influences upon them.\n\nOf the factors caused by human intervention that can affect this environment, activities that sustain the economy of Albania such as mining and forestry are notably influential. The environment strongly influences public health in Albania, as for example air pollution and smog in urban areas such as in Tirana can result in great distress for those with respiratory conditions such as asthma.\n\nAlbania is a small predominantly mountainous country between Southeastern and Southern Europe, on facing the Adriatic and Ionian seas within the Mediterranean Sea. It has a total area of , bordering Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, Macedonia to the east and Greece to the south. It lies between latitudes 42° and 39° N and between longitudes 21° and 19° E. Its coastline length is and extends along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas.\n\nWith Albania's coastline facing the Adriatic and Ionian seas, its highlands backed upon the elevated Balkan landmass, and the entire country lying at a latitude subject to a variety of weather patterns during the winter and summer seasons, Albania has a high number of climatic regions for such a small area. The coastal lowlands have typically mediterranean climate; the highlands have a continental climate. In both the lowlands and the interior, the weather varies markedly from north to south.\n\nInland temperatures are affected more by differences in elevation than by latitude or any other factor. Low winter temperatures in the mountains are caused by the continental air mass that dominates the weather in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Northerly and northeasterly winds blow much of the time. Average summer temperatures are lower than in the coastal areas and much lower at higher elevations, but daily fluctuations are greater. Daytime maximum temperatures in the interior basins and river valleys are very high, but the nights are almost always cool.\n\nPhytogeographically, Albania is part of the Boreal Kingdom specifically, part of the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region and Mediterranean region within the Boreal kingdom. Albania is divided into three ecoregions including Illyrian deciduous forests, Dinaric mixed forests, Balkan mixed forests and Pindus mixed forests. Further, Biomes in Albania include Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest and Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub, that are all in the Palearctic ecozone. Due to its climatic, hydrological, geological and topographical conditions, Albania is one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity. Almost 30% of the entire flora and 42% fauna in the entire European contitent can be found in Albania.\n\nThere are 799 Albanian protected areas, which covers a surface of . These include 15 national parks, 5 protected landscape areas, 29 nature reserves, 4 protected resource areas and 750 nature monuments. The national parks covering a surface area of or roughly 13.65% of the overall territory. The nation host also 8 archaeological parks covering a surface area of . The largest national park in Albania is the Fir of Hotova National Park, covering a surface area of and having the largest area of Bulgarian Fir in the Balkans. Other large national parks includes the Butrint National Park, Karaburun-Sazan National Marine Park, Divjaka-Karavasta National Park, Prespa National Park, Shebenik-Jabllanice National Park, and others.\n\n"}
{"id": "9861384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9861384", "title": "Fleming valve", "text": "Fleming valve\n\nThe Fleming valve, also called the Fleming oscillation valve, was a thermionic valve or vacuum tube invented in 1904 by Englishman John Ambrose Fleming as a detector for early radio receivers used in electromagnetic wireless telegraphy. It was the first practical vacuum tube and the first thermionic diode, a vacuum tube whose purpose is to conduct current in one direction and block current flowing in the opposite direction. The thermionic diode was later widely used as a rectifier — a device which converts alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC) — in the power supplies of a wide range of electronic devices, until beginning to be replaced by the selenium rectifier in the early 1930s and almost completely replaced by the semiconductor diode in the 1960s. The Fleming valve was the forerunner of all vacuum tubes, which dominated electronics for 50 years. The IEEE has described it as \"one of the most important developments in the history of electronics\", and it is on the List of IEEE Milestones for electrical engineering.\n\nThe valve consists of an evacuated glass bulb containing two electrodes: a cathode in the form of a \"filament\", a loop of carbon or fine tungsten wire, similar to that used in the light bulbs of the time, and an anode (plate) consisting of a sheet metal plate. Although in early versions the anode was a flat metal plate placed next to the cathode, in later versions it became a metal cylinder surrounding the cathode. In some versions, a grounded copper screen surrounded the bulb to shield against the influence of external electric fields.\n\nIn operation, a separate current flows through the cathode \"filament\", heating it so that some of the electrons in the metal gain sufficient energy to escape their parent atoms into the vacuum of the tube, a process called thermionic emission. The AC to be rectified is applied between the filament and the plate. When the plate has a positive voltage with respect to the filament, the electrons are attracted to it and an electric current flows from filament to plate. In contrast, when the plate has a negative voltage with respect to the filament, the electrons are not attracted to it and no current flows through the tube (unlike the filament, the plate does not emit electrons). As current can pass through the valve in one direction only, it therefore \"rectifies\" an AC to a pulsing DC current.\n\nThis simple operation was somewhat complicated by the presence of residual air in the valve, as the vacuum pumps of Fleming's time were unable to create as high a vacuum as exists in modern vacuum tubes. At high voltages, the valve could become unstable and oscillate, but this occurred at voltages far above those normally used.\n\nThe Fleming valve was the first practical application of thermionic emission, discovered in 1873 by Frederick Guthrie. As a result of his work on the incandescent light bulb, Thomas Edison made his own discovery of the phenomenon in 1880, which led to it being called the \"Edison effect\". Edison was granted a patent for this device as part of an electrical indicator in 1884, but did not find a practical use for it. Professor Fleming of University College London consulted for the Edison Electric Light Company from 1881-1891, and subsequently for the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company. \n\nIn 1901 Fleming designed the transmitter used by Guglielmo Marconi in the first transmission of radio waves across the Atlantic from Poldhu, England, to Nova Scotia, Canada. The distance between the two points was about . Although the contact, reported November 12, 1901, was widely heralded as a great scientific advance at the time, there is also some skepticism about the claim, because the received signal, the three dots of the Morse code letter \"S\", was so weak the primitive receiver had difficulty distinguishing it from atmospheric radio noise caused by static discharges, leading later critics to suggest it may have been random noise. Regardless, it was clear to Fleming that reliable transatlantic communication with the existing transmitter required more sensitive receiving apparatus. \n\nThe receiver for the transatlantic demonstration employed a coherer, which had poor sensitivity and degraded the tuning of the receiver. This led Fleming to look for a detector which was more sensitive and reliable while at the same time being better suited for use with tuned circuits. In 1904 Fleming tried an Edison effect bulb for this purpose, and found that it worked well to rectify high frequency oscillations and thus allow detection of the rectified signals by a galvanometer. On November 16, 1904, he applied for a US patent for what he termed an oscillation valve. This patent was subsequently issued as number 803,684 and found immediate utility in the detection of messages sent by Morse code.\n\nThe Fleming valve proved to be the start of a technological revolution. After reading Fleming's 1905 paper on his oscillation valve, American engineer Lee DeForest in 1906 created a three-element vacuum tube, the Audion, by adding a wire grid between cathode and anode. It was the first electronic amplifying device, allowing the creation of amplifiers and continuous wave oscillators. De Forest quickly refined his device into the triode, which became the basis of long-distance telephone and radio communications, radars, and early digital computers for 50 years, until the advent of the transistor in the 1960s. Fleming sued De Forest for infringing his valve patents, resulting in decades of expensive and disruptive litigation, which were not settled until 1943 when the United States Supreme Court ruled Fleming's patent invalid.\n\nLater, when vacuum tube equipment began to be powered from wall power by transformers instead of batteries, the Fleming valve was developed into a rectifier to produce the DC plate (anode) voltage required by other vacuum tubes. Around 1914 Irving Langmuir at General Electric developed a high voltage version called the Kenotron which was used to power x-ray tubes. As a rectifier, the tube was used for high voltage applications but its high internal resistance made it inefficient in low voltage, high current applications. Until vacuum tube equipment was replaced by transistors in the 1970s, radios and televisions usually had one or more diode tubes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "531104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=531104", "title": "Gravity Probe B", "text": "Gravity Probe B\n\nGravity Probe B (GP-B) was a satellite-based mission to test two unverified predictions of general relativity: the geodetic effect and frame-dragging. This was to be accomplished by measuring, very precisely, tiny changes in the direction of spin of four gyroscopes contained in an Earth satellite orbiting at 650 km (400 mi) altitude, crossing directly over the poles.\n\nThe satellite was launched on 20 April 2004 on a Delta II rocket. The spaceflight phase lasted until <time>2005</time>; its aim was to measure spacetime curvature near Earth, and thereby the stress–energy tensor (which is related to the distribution and the motion of matter in space) in and near Earth. This provided a test of general relativity, gravitomagnetism and related models. The principal investigator was Francis Everitt.\n\nInitial results confirmed the expected geodetic effect to an accuracy of about 1%. The expected frame-dragging effect was similar in magnitude to the current noise level (the noise being dominated by initially unmodeled effects due to nonuniform coatings on the gyroscopes). Work continued to model and account for these sources of error, thus permitting extraction of the frame-dragging signal. By <time datetime=\"2008-08\">August 2008</time>, the frame-dragging effect had been confirmed to within 15% of the expected result, and the <time datetime=\"2008-12\">December 2008</time> NASA report indicated that the geodetic effect was confirmed to better than 0.5%.\n\nIn an article published in the journal \"Physical Review Letters\" in <time>2011</time>, the authors reported analysis of the data from all four gyroscopes results in a geodetic drift rate of and a frame-dragging drift rate of , in good agreement with the general relativity predictions of and , respectively.\n\nGravity Probe B was a relativity gyroscope experiment funded by NASA. Efforts were led by Stanford University physics department with Lockheed Martin as the primary subcontractor. Mission scientists viewed it as the second gravity experiment in space, following the successful launch of Gravity Probe A (GP-A) in <time>1976</time>.\n\nThe mission plans were to test two unverified predictions of general relativity: the geodetic effect and frame-dragging. This was to be accomplished by measuring, very precisely, tiny changes in the direction of spin of four gyroscopes contained in an Earth satellite orbiting at 650 km (400 mi) altitude, crossing directly over the poles. The gyroscopes were intended to be so free from disturbance that they would provide a near-perfect space-time reference system. This would allow them to reveal how space and time are \"warped\" by the presence of the Earth, and by how much the Earth's rotation \"drags\" space-time around with it.\n\nThe geodetic effect is an effect caused by space-time being \"curved\" by the mass of the Earth. A gyroscope's axis when parallel transported around the Earth in one complete revolution does not end up pointing in exactly the same direction as before. The angle \"missing\" may be thought of as the amount the gyroscope \"leans over\" into the slope of the space-time curvature. A more precise explanation for the space curvature part of the geodetic precession is obtained by using a nearly flat cone to model the space curvature of the Earth's gravitational field. Such a cone is made by cutting out a thin \"pie-slice\" from a circle and gluing the cut edges together. The spatial geodetic precession is a measure of the missing \"pie-slice\" angle. Gravity Probe B was expected to measure this effect to an accuracy of one part in 10,000, the most stringent check on general relativistic predictions to date.\n\nThe much smaller frame-dragging effect is an example of gravitomagnetism. It is an analog of magnetism in classical electrodynamics, but caused by rotating masses rather than rotating electric charges. Previously, only two analyses of the laser-ranging data obtained by the two LAGEOS satellites, published in <time>1997</time> and <time>2004</time>, claimed to have found the frame-dragging effect with an accuracy of about 20% and 10% respectively, whereas Gravity Probe B aimed to measure the frame dragging effect to a precision of 1%. However, Lorenzo Iorio claimed that the level of total uncertainty of the tests conducted with the two LAGEOS satellites has likely been greatly underestimated. A recent analysis of Mars Global Surveyor data has claimed to have confirmed the frame dragging effect to a precision of 0.5%, although the accuracy of this claim is disputed. Also the Lense–Thirring effect of the Sun has been recently investigated in view of a possible detection with the inner planets in the near future.\n\nThe launch was planned for <time datetime=\"2004-04-19\">19 April 2004</time> at Vandenberg Air Force Base but was scrubbed within 5 minutes of the scheduled launch window due to changing winds in the upper atmosphere. An unusual feature of the mission is that it only had a one-second launch window due to the precise orbit required by the experiment. On <time datetime=\"2004-04-20 09:57:23-07:00\">20 April, at 9:57:23 AM</time> PDT (<time datetime=\"2004-04-20 16:57:23Z\">16:57:23</time> UTC) the spacecraft was launched successfully. The satellite was placed in orbit at <time datetime=\"2004-04-20 11:12:33-07:00\">11:12:33</time> AM (<time datetime=\"2004-04-20 18:12:33Z\">18:12:33</time> UTC) after a cruise period over the south pole and a short second burn. The mission lasted 16 months.\nSome preliminary results were presented at a special session during the American Physical Society meeting in <time datetime=\"2007-04\">April 2007</time>. NASA initially requested a proposal for extending the GP-B data analysis phase through <time datetime=\"2007-12\">December 2007</time>. The data analysis phase was further extended to <time datetime=\"2008-09\">September 2008</time> using funding from Richard Fairbank, Stanford and NASA, and beyond that point using non-NASA funding only. Final science results were reported in <time>2011</time>.\n\nThe \"Gravity Probe B\" experiment comprised four London moment gyroscopes and a reference telescope sighted on HR8703 (also known as IM Pegasi), a binary star in the constellation Pegasus. In polar orbit, with the gyro spin directions also pointing toward HR8703, the frame-dragging and geodetic effects came out at right angles, each gyroscope measuring both.\n\nThe gyroscopes were housed in a dewar of superfluid helium, maintaining a temperature of under . Near-absolute zero temperatures were required to minimize molecular interference, and enable the lead and niobium components of the gyroscope mechanisms to become superconductive.\n\nAt the time of their manufacture, the gyroscopes were the most nearly spherical objects ever made. (Two gyroscopes still hold that record, but third place has been taken by the silicon spheres made by the Avogadro project.) Approximately the size of ping pong balls, they were perfectly round to within forty atoms (less than ). If one of these spheres were scaled to the size of the Earth, the tallest mountains and deepest ocean trench would measure only \n\nIM Pegasi was chosen as the guide star for multiple reasons. First, it needed to be bright enough to be usable for sightings. Then it was close to the ideal positions near at the celestial equator of the sky coordinates. Also important was its well understood motion in the sky, which was helped by the fact that this star emits relatively strong radio signals. In preparation for the setup of this mission, astronomers analyzed the radio-based position measurements with respect to far distant quasars taken over several years to understand its motion as precisely as needed.\n\nThe conceptual design for this mission was first proposed by an MIT professor, George Pugh, who was working with the U.S. Department of Defense in <time>1959</time> and later discussed by Leonard Schiff (Stanford) in <time>1960</time> at Pugh's suggestion, based partly on a theoretical paper about detecting frame dragging that Schiff had written in <time>1957</time>. It was proposed to NASA in <time>1961</time>, and they supported the project with funds in <time>1964</time>. This grant ended in <time>1977</time> after a long phase of engineering research into the basic requirements and tools for the satellite.\n\nIn <time>1986</time> NASA changed plans for the shuttle, which forced the mission team to switch from a shuttle-based launch design to one that was based on the Delta 2, and in <time>1995</time> tests planned of a prototype on a shuttle flight were cancelled as well.\n\nGravity Probe B marks the first time in history that a university has been in control of the development and operations of a space satellite funded by NASA.\n\nTotal cost of this project was about $750 million.\n\nThis is a list of major events for the GP-B experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn <time datetime=\"2007-02-09\">9 February 2007</time>, it was announced that a number of unexpected signals had been received and that these would need to be separated out before final results could be released. In <time datetime=\"2007-04\">April</time> it was announced that the spin axes of the gyroscopes were affected by torque, in a manner that varied over time, requiring further analysis to allow the results to be corrected for this source of error. Consequently, the date for the final release of data was pushed back several times. In the data for the frame-dragging results presented at the <time datetime=\"2007-04\">April 2007</time> meeting of the American Physical Society, the random errors were much larger than the theoretical expected value and scattered on both the positive and negative sides of a null result, therefore causing skepticism as to whether any useful data could be extracted in the future to test this effect.\n\nIn <time datetime=\"2007-06\">June 2007</time>, a detailed update was released explaining the cause of the problem, and the solution that was being worked on. Although electrostatic patches caused by non-uniform coating of the spheres were anticipated, and were thought to have been controlled for before the experiment, it was subsequently found that the final layer of the coating on the spheres defined two halves of slightly different contact potential, which gave the sphere an electrostatic axis. This created a classical dipole torque on each rotor, of a magnitude similar to the expected frame dragging effect. In addition, it dissipated energy from the polhode motion by inducing currents in the housing electrodes, causing the motion to change with time. This meant that a simple time-average polhode model was insufficient, and a detailed orbit by orbit model was needed to remove the effect. As it was anticipated that \"anything could go wrong\", the final part of the flight mission was calibration, where amongst other activities, data was gathered with the spacecraft axis deliberately mis-aligned for <time datetime=\"PT24h\">24 hours</time>, to exacerbate any potential problems. This data proved invaluable for identifying the effects. With the electrostatic torque modeled as a function of axis misalignment, and the polhode motion modeled at a sufficiently fine level, it was hoped to isolate the relativity torques to the originally expected resolution.\n\nStanford agreed to release the raw data to the public at an unspecified date in the future. It is likely that this data will be examined by independent scientists and independently reported to the public well after the final release by the project scientists.

ICROA’s membership consists of those established carbon reduction and offset providers based in the United States, European and Asia-Pacific markets which commit to the ICROA Code of Best Practice.\n\nICROA was established in 2008 to provide self-regulation of the voluntary carbon market. Members produce an annual report demonstrating compliance with the ICROA Code. The ICROA Code promotes a combined ‘reduce and offset’ approach to carbon management and has specific requirements for how members provide their carbon footprinting, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction advice and offsetting services. ICROA aims that member’s compliance with their Code will bring credibility to the voluntary carbon market.\n\nICROA was launched by eight carbon reduction and offset providers on June 9, 2008. Along with the initial eight, ICROA has been open to new members which meet its membership criteria, and this was reflected in their early announcement that they intended to increase fourfold over the following twelve months. Nevertheless, the co-chairman of the organization, Jonathan Shopley, stated in 2008 that most offset providers would not be qualified to join.\n\nWith ICROA headquartered in the United Kingdom, the eight founding members consisted of five British firms (Carbon Clear, The Carbon Neutral Company, ClimateCare, co2balance and Targetneutral), two from the United States (Native Energy and TerraPass), and one from Australia (Climate Friendly). Current membership is eleven companies worldwide.\n\nThe ICROA Code is available in full on the ICROA website.

In a statement a spokesman said, \"Unfortunately, it still fails to recognise VERs and we feel very strongly there's no reason for this.\" In turn ICROA was criticised by Dr Bruce Elliott, managing director of carbon offset company Clear which had achieved accreditation under the government scheme. Elliot stated that, \"The trade body which represents offset organisations who sell VERs, ICROA, have unsurprisingly been vociferous in their criticism of the scheme. Many of its members have substantial investments in VER projects which now face an uncertain future without the government’s backing. This financial conflict of interest is readily apparent in their persistent public criticism of a scheme which matches or sets higher standards than its own code of conduct for the majority of criteria.\"\n\nIn June 2011, The UK Government's Quality Assurance Scheme (QAS) for Carbon Offsetting, closed down.

{"id": "25836768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25836768", "title": "James Colnett", "text": "James Colnett\n\nJames Colnett (1753 – 1 September 1806) was an officer of the British Royal Navy, an explorer, and a maritime fur trader. He served under James Cook during Cook's second voyage of exploration. Later he led two private trading expeditions that involved collecting sea otter pelts in the Pacific Northwest of North America and selling them in Canton, China, where the British East India Company maintained a trading post. Wintering in the recently discovered Hawaiian Islands was a key component of the new trade system. Colnett is remembered largely for his involvement in the Nootka Crisis of 1789—initially a dispute between British traders and the Spanish Navy over the use of Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island that became an international crisis that led Britain and Spain to the brink of war before being peacefully resolved through diplomacy and the signing of the Nootka Conventions.\n\nDue to Colnett's central role in the initial incident that sparked the international crisis, Colnett's account of his second fur trading voyage, including the events at Nootka Sound in 1789, was published in 1940, as part of the Champlain Society's General Series. His first trading voyage journal remained unpublished until 2005.\n\nColnett was born in Devon at Devonport in 1753, and was baptised on 18 October 1753 at Stoke Damerel parish church, Plymouth. His parents were James and Sarah (née Lang) Colnett. He had two older sisters and one younger brother. Very little is known about his life until he joined the Royal Navy as an able-bodied seaman in 1770.\n\nColnett joined the Royal Navy in June 1770, initially serving as an able seaman aboard , and then aboard as a midshipman under Lieutenant James Cook from September until December 1771, when both Cook and Colnett moved to . Colnett served as a midshipman during Cook's second voyage to the Pacific Ocean between 1772 and 1775. After returning to England in 1775, Colnett continued to serve in the Royal Navy during the American War of Independence, being appointed gunner aboard on 1 January 1776 and then as master of . He rose in the ranks, passing his lieutenant's examination on 4 February 1779, and ten days later, on 14 February, he was appointed third lieutenant of . He was with \"Bienfaisant\" until 1783, when he joined as her first lieutenant. On 17 August 1786 he went on half pay as work for naval officers fell following the end of hostilities.\n\nBetween 1786 and 1791 Colnett led two private fur-trading ventures. With the Royal Navy's approval and a leave of absence he was first given command of a two-vessel fur trading expedition to the Pacific Northwest coast, Hawaii, and China. The vessels included the \"Prince of Wales\" and \"Princess Royal\". Afterwards, a second expedition was organized with the \"Argonaut\" and the \"Princess Royal\". The second expedition culminated in the Nootka Crisis. The first voyage was under the aegis of the London-based King George's Sound Company, first known as Richard Cadman Etches and Company, which owned the ships. The second was a joint venture of the King George's Sound Company and John Meares and his partners. Both companies were exploring the possibilities of collecting sea otter pelts along the Pacific Northwest coast, via trade with the indigenous peoples, and selling the goods in China. The idea had its origins in Cook’s third voyage, during which sea otter pelts obtained along the northwest coast of America, from Nootka Sound northwards, were sold for high prices and great profit in Canton.\n\nDuring the first fur-trading venture Colnett was in command of a two-vessel expedition. Colnett himself was captain of the 171-ton ship \"Prince of Wales\". The second vessel was the 65-ton sloop \"Princess Royal\", under Charles Duncan. The ships were owned by the King George's Sound Company, or Richard Cadman Etches and Company, and operated under licenses from the South Sea Company and the East India Company, which had a monopoly on British trade in the Pacific Ocean. The two ships left England on 23 September 1786, rounded Cape Horn, and reached the Pacific Northwest late in the summer of 1787. After trading for furs with the indigenous peoples in the vicinity of the Queen Charlotte Islands, Aristazabal Island, and Banks Island, Colnett and Duncan sailed to the Hawaiian Islands where they spent the winter. While on the coast of present-day British Columbia they had a series of first contact encounters with some of the Kitkatla Tsimshian. In Hawaii they were involved in several violent conflicts with the islanders, including one at Waimea Bay, during which between five and fourteen Hawaiians were killed.\n\nDuring his voyage, Colnett became the first European to see parts of the southern Queen Charlotte Islands. Juan Pérez had visited the northern Queen Charlottes in 1774, but had not gone ashore. Colnett and his crew were among the first Europeans to set foot on the islands. They were also the first British explorers to contact the Tsimshian and southern Heiltsuk people.\n\nAlthough his primary focus was collecting sea otter pelts, Colnett explored the complex coastline in detail, apparently in hopes of finding the fabled Northwest Passage. His journal contains twelve maps of various channels, harbours, inlets, and other coastal features.\n\nAfter spending the winter of 1787-88 in Hawaii, Colnett and Duncan returned to the Pacific Northwest to acquire more furs. Once on the coast they parted ways and operated separately, unlike the previous year when they remained in company. After trading through the summer Charles Duncan heading south for Nootka Sound. Before arriving he heard from fellow fur trader John Meares that Colnett was not at Nootka. Therefore, Duncan did not stop there but instead continued trading for furs south of Nootka Sound, in the vicinity of Clayoquot Sound and near the entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. In August 1788 Duncan sailed the \"Princess Royal\" to Hawaii where he found Colnett and the \"Prince of Wales\". Together they sailed to Canton, China, arriving in late November 1788. They sold their cargo of sea otter pelts. The \"Prince of Wales\" was taken back to England via the Cape of Good Hope, but James Colnett stayed in China. The \"Princess Royal\" also remained in order to carry out a second fur trading voyage starting the next year. Colnett was given command of another two-vessel expedition. The \"Argonaut\" sailed under Colnett, with the \"Princess Royal\" under Thomas Hudson.\n\nDuring the time of Colnett's first voyage two other British ships, owned by John Meares and his partners, were trading on the North West coast. Meares had chosen not to pay for licenses from the East India Company and South Sea Company, instead striving to conceal the ship's illegal conduct by using the Portuguese flag. During the winter of 1788-89 the owners of all four vessels decided to form a joint venture under the protection of the licenses, although the South Sea Company license applied only to the \"Prince of Wales\" and \"Princess Royal\". The joint venture had no firm name; Meares called it variously \"The Associated Merchants of London and India\" or \"The United Company of British Merchants Trading to the North West Coast of America\". Colnett called it \"The South Sea Company of London\". It was loosely referred to as \"this united Company\". In early 1789 Colnett was given command of the joint undertaking as a whole. He was made captain of the \"Argonaut\" and given command over its tender, the \"Princess Royal\", under Thomas Hudson. The goal of the joint venture was not just to send vessels to the North West coast but also to set up a permanent trading post at Nootka Sound, to be named Fort Pitt. Meares claimed he had purchased land there from Chief Maquinna of the Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) people. The post could be built on Meares's land. Later, the question of whether Meares had actually acquired land from Maquinna become an issue of contention. Even if he had there were unresolvable questions about the amount of land purchased and its location. In time Chief Maquinna denied that any such purchase had been made, saying instead that the Spanish had the only rightful claim to land at Nootka Sound. Meares, one of the primary forces behind the venture, hoped that a permanent post at Nootka Sound would establish his own dominance in the lucrative marine fur trade. However, before the British ships arrived Spanish forces had already occupied the harbour and established their own fort. By the time Colnett's \"Argonaut\" arrived at Nootka Sound, the first phase of the crisis had already begun. The Spanish had taken control of the port and seized Captain Douglas and his ship.\n\nBefore the Nootka Crisis of 1789, Spain had long held that all foreign sailors in the Pacific Ocean were to be treated as enemies. Spanish claims of sovereignty, especially on the west coasts of the Americas, dated back centuries. One of the first serious threats to the Spanish claim came from the extension of Russian fur trading activity from Siberia to Alaska during the middle and later parts of the 18th century. Spain reacted not only by expanding the foothold already gained in Alta California but also by launching a series of exploration and reconnaissance voyages from San Blas, Mexico, to Alaska. The purpose of these voyages was not only to ascertain the Russian threat but to reinforce their claims of sovereignty by right of first-discovery and through the use of formal possession-taking rituals, which were still regarded as a meaningful part of international law. Another purpose was to search for a possible Northwest Passage, which, if it existed and fell under the control of another nation such as Britain, could prove disastrous to New Spain's Pacific coast. Juan Pérez was the first to sail to the far north, reaching the Queen Charlotte Islands in 1774. Subsequent expeditions were launched in 1775, 1779, and 1788. Detailed information about Russian activities in Alaska was acquired in 1788, including ominous indications that Russia might seize control of Nootka Sound. This, in addition to the rapidly increasing numbers of fur traders working the Pacific Northwest coast—mainly British but also American and others—coupled with Spain's firm claim of sovereignty north to 61°N latitude (the vicinity of Prince William Sound, Alaska), and the lack of any Spanish outpost north of California, made it imperative that a firm stand be taken. During the 1780s Nootka Sound had become the focal point of all these conflicting factors. It was perhaps not the best port of the region, but it was well known and well charted, fairly easy to reach, and usefully located at a general base of operations and a place of rendezvous. Over the years it had become the fur-trader's primary harbour and gathering point. Factors such as these resulted in Russia, Britain, and Spain all deciding to build a fort there, in order to solidify their claims and interests. From Spain's perspective, which had long regarded the entire region as Spanish territory, the occupation of Nootka Sound would be the first step toward creating a new province of New Spain, north of California and south of Alaska. Implicit in such a plan was the restriction of free trade by other nations, a policy the Spanish had long enforced within the lands of the empire. The position of the British government, since the days of Queen Elizabeth, had been that its subjects had the right to navigate the ocean and visit, trade, and make settlements anywhere not already occupied by a civilized nation.\n\nIn 1789 a Spanish expedition under Estebàn José Martínez set sail from San Blas in order to occupy Nootka Sound. Arriving on 5 May 1789, the Spanish quickly built a few buildings and a small fort with the Spanish flag clearly displayed. Martinez formally occupied the land and began checking the papers of visiting vessels. Two American fur trading ships were already anchored in the sound, one of which was the \"Columbia Rediviva\", and more arrived later, including the \"Lady Washington\", under Robert Gray. Soon after Martínez secured control of the Nootka Sound a number of other vessels arrived, including the \"Princess Royal\", under Thomas Hudson, along with \"Iphigenia\" (William Douglas); the \"Argonaut\", under James Colnett, and \"North West America\", under Robert Funter—all British fur trading vessels. Martínez was particularly troubled by the appearance of Colnett's \"Argonaut\". Not only was the \"Argonaut\" carrying material and supplies obviously intended for the construction of a permanent base, but a group of Chinese laborers were also on board, one of the first examples of \"coolie\" labour in the Pacific Northwest. Martínez, whose warships gave him \"de facto\" control, asserted Spanish sovereignty. After a heated exchange between the two men, Martínez had Colnett arrested, along with the crew of the \"Argonaut\". Martínez wrote in his journal about personal insults slung at him by Colnett. He was also irritated by Colnett having sailed the \"Argonaut\" under Portuguese rather than a British flag, which he felt was deceptive. After a complicated series of events, Martínez ended up with three captured ships and their crews, including the \"Argonaut\", \"Princess Royal\", and \"North West America\". Hudson had taken the \"Princess Royal\" into Nootka Sound earlier and had been allowed to leave on the condition he proceed to China. Instead, he collected more furs from the region and returned to Nootka Sound, expecting Martínez would no longer be there. Hudson did not intend to enter the sound but the \"Princess Royal\" was becalmed on an incoming tide. A Spanish longboat captured the ship and towed it in.\n\nThe prisoners were eventually released and the ships returned. The Chinese workers were forced to help build Fort San Miguel, a small battery of Spanish cannon overlooking the entrance to Friendly Cove, the main harbour of Nootka Sound at the time.\n\nThe British ships captured by Martínez, along with Colnett and his crew, still prisoners, were taken to the Spanish naval base at San Blas, Mexico. In Britain, King George III and Prime Minister William Pitt soon learned what had happened to the British ships, officers, and crews. The arrest of James Colnett, who was after all still an officer of the Royal Navy, was particularly troublesome in England. Angered by the incident and by ongoing competition with Spain for the Pacific Northwest, the British threatened war. France, a Spanish ally, was coping with the early stages of the French Revolution and would not be able to fight for Spain in an armed conflict. Without the French, Spain could not realistically secure their massive North and South American territories in the event of war with Britain. Bowing to pressure from Britain, Spain agreed to sign the Nootka Conventions in 1790, ending the Nootka Crisis and beginning the first phase of the Spanish withdrawal from the Pacific Northwest. Three separate Nootka Conventions were signed and it took over five years to resolve the many outstanding problems. Among other things, Spain agreed to restore the captured ships to their owners and pay them an indemnity. Both nations sent officials to Nootka Sound in order to carry out the details of the Nootka Conventions. George Vancouver served as Britain's representative at Nootka, while Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra served as Spain's. While both were respectful toward one another and even became friends, they could not reach an agreement about how to carry out their instructions. They decided instead to await further instructions. At this time, they decided to name the large island on which Nootka was now proven to be located as \"Quadra and Vancouver Island\". Years later, as Spanish influence declined, the name was shortened to simply Vancouver Island.\n\nSpain continued to occupy Nootka Sound until 28 March 1795. Under the Nootka Convention, Britain and Spain agreed not to establish any permanent base at Nootka Sound, but ships from either nation could visit. The two nations also agreed to prevent any other nation from establishing sovereignty.\n\nAfter the initial crisis at Nootka Sound, James Colnett was taken to San Blas, New Spain, and kept under Spanish custody until released in May 1790. His company's ship, the \"Argonaut\" was returned to his command. He was still not permitted to leave until July, after which he sailed north to Clayoquot Sound where he resumed his fur trading activities. In early 1791, he revisited Nootka Sound. By then Francisco de Eliza was the Spanish commandant at Nootka. Colnett had been given a passport by the Vice Roy of New Spain allowing him to sail to Nootka Sound in order to receive the \"Princess Royal\", which had been seized in 1789, but to then leave the coast because it was, the Vice Roy said, Spanish territory. Colnett was also forbidden to trade with the indigenous peoples. However, when Colnett arrived at Nootka he told Eliza, the commandant, that the passport had been lost at sea. Colnett spent about five months trading along the coast, acquiring about 1,100 sea otter pelts.\n\nBy the time Colnett arrived at Nootka Sound the \"Princess Royal\" had sailed to San Blas, arriving there about 13 November 1790. Therefore, it could not be returned to Colnett as required by the Nootka Conventions. The governments of Spain and Britain agreed that the vessel would be returned to its owners in Macau. Manuel Quimper sailed it from San Blas to the Philippines, stopping at Hawaii on the way. Another Spanish officer was to take the vessel from the Philippines to Macau. Meanwhile, Colnett, having finished trading on the North West coast also sailed to China via Hawaii. By chance both Colnett and Quimper arrived at Hawaii in March 1791. The two met. Colnett demanded that the \"Princess Royal\" be turned over at once, while Quimper explained his orders were to take it to the Philippines. Colnett became angry and prepared to seize the ship by force. The quarrel was calmed by John Kendrick Jr. (sometimes known as Juan Kendrick) who had come to Nootka in 1788 aboard the Columbia Rediviva with his father John Kendrick, entered Spanish service as a pilot, and was now on board the \"Princess Royal\". Quimper slipped away at a convenient time and sailed to Manila, arriving in June.\n\nColnett sailed from Hawaii to China, arriving at Macau on 30 May 1791. To his chagrin he found that the Chinese officials had prohibited all ships with furs from entering the port of Canton. China was at war with Russia and thought the ban on fur trading would injure Russia. The prohibition was imposed in early 1791 and lifted on 30 May 1792. Unable to sell his cargo, Colnett sailed to Japan in a bold but unsuccessful attempt to trade there. Thus the \"Argonaut\" under Colnett was the first British ship to try to re-open trade with Japan since 1673, when the East India Company's ship \"Return\" tried and likewise failed. Eventually Colnett was able to sell some of his furs in northern China. He then sailed for England with his remaining cargo, which he sold to the East India Company for ₤9,760.\n\nLater, in 1792, he sailed to the Galapagos Islands on behalf of private whaling interests. His work led to the development of whaling near the Galapagos Islands. The maps from the survey carried out in 1793, 1794 are inscribed by Captain James Colnett of the Royal Navy in the merchant-ship Rattler.\nColnett returned to England after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars and was promoted to commander on 19 December 1794. He was given command of the sloop , and in March 1795 examined the coastal defences of the east coast of England from the River Thames to Boston aboard the galley , subsequently producing a report for the Admiralty. He was advanced to post-captain on 4 October 1796 and appoint to command the following day. His period of command was short-lived, \"Hussar\" was wrecked off the coast of Brittany and Colnett was captured and imprisoned for six months by the French. On his release he was tried by court-martial for the loss of his ship, but was acquitted. After his release he tried to convince the Royal Navy to launch a surprise attack against Spain's poorly defended Pacific coast. On 29 June 1802, he was appointed to command the transport , on what became his last Pacific voyage. In command of \"Glatton\", he sailed on 23 September with 399 convicts and some free settlers to Australia. Only 12 of the convicts died during the voyage. Before departing Sydney, Colnett unsuccessfully petitioned Governor Philip Gidley King for a free pardon for one of the female convicts, so that she might share his cabin for the return voyage to England. His petition having failed, Colnett set sail for home with a cargo of timber for use in the Royal dockyards. He remained in command of \"Glatton\" until 7 March 1805, when he retired on half-pay. He died at his lodgings at Great Ormond Street in London on 1 September 1806. The bulk of his estate he left to his daughter, Elizabeth, although he had never married.\n\nThere are several places named after James Colnett including Bahía Colnett (bay) and nearby Cabo Colnett (cape) on Mexico's Baja California peninsula, ; Mount Colnett on New Caledonia, ; Cabo Colnett (cape) and nearby Bahía Colnett (bay) in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, ; and Mount Colnett on Meares Island, British Columbia, Canada, . Argonaut Point, in Nootka Sound, British Columbia, is named for Colnett's ship, .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35707783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35707783", "title": "James Wharram", "text": "James Wharram\n\nJames Wharram (born 15 May 1928 in Manchester, England) is a multihull pioneer and designer of catamarans.\nIn 1953, after long studies into the records of boats of the Pacific in the libraries and museums of Britain, and inspired by Eric de Bisschop's book \"The voyage of the Kaimiloa\", he designed and built the first British ocean-going double-canoe-catamaran, the \"Tangaroa\" (length ) and in 1955–56 sailed with Jutta Schultze-Rohnhof and Ruth Merseburger, across the Atlantic to Trinidad – the beginning of cruising and transatlantic crossing with a catamaran.\n\nNo scholars in the Western world at this time believed that the Polynesians had boats capable of directed ocean voyages. Wharram believed otherwise and set out to prove it by doing it himself. He followed this first Atlantic crossing by building a 40-foot V-hull double canoe, \"Rongo\", in Trinidad in 1957–58, with Bernard Moitessier's help, and sailing her across the North Atlantic in 1959 from New York to Ireland. This was the first west-to-east crossing of the Atlantic by catamaran or multihull.\n\nThe story was told by Wharram in the 1969 book \"Two Girls Two Catamarans\".\n\nFrom 1973 Wharram was assisted by his co-designer Hanneke Boon. In 1987-92 James and his partners built a new flagship, the 63-foot catamaran \"Spirit of Gaia\", which they sailed into the Pacific and round the world, to study Indo-Pacific canoe-craft (1994–98).\n\nIn 2008-9 James Wharram and Hanneke Boon conceived the Lapita Voyage expedition, sailing two double canoes based on traditional Polynesian hullform, from the Philippines to Tikopia and Anuta in the Solomon Islands. The ‘Lapita Voyage’ was a major expedition in Experimental Marine Archaeology. It was the first exploration of one possible migration route into the Central Pacific by Ethnic sailing craft.\n\nWharram designs are inspired by Polynesian double canoes and typically have an open deck, with small deckpod(s) for crew shelter. James Wharram combined boat building with studies of Polynesian culture. Most modern catamarans are built as a single rigid structure thereby sustaining greater forces and stresses in waves, whereas on Wharrams the separate hulls are connected to the crossbeams with (synthetic) rope lashings, in true Polynesian style. The flexibility of the Wharram system makes the boats suffer less stress in ocean waves. \n\nThe rig on Wharrams since the early 1980s is the 'Wharram Wingsail Rig', an appropriate tech squareheaded rig with low turbulence pocket round the mast and a short adjustable gaff at the head. The advantages of this rig are simplicity, low turbulence and the fact that it can be lowered in a following wind at any time. The Centre of effort on all Wharram rigs is kept low, giving them very good stability. No full-size Wharram has been known to have capsized.\n\nMany of the cabin interiors are designed to flexy-space principles, the concept being multi-purpose space on a human scale, in which less is more and the simpler the construction, the better. The slim v-shaped hulls have a very good speed/length ratio and all have canoe sterns, giving minimum drag, even when loaded. This hullshape requires no keels or boards to sail to windward, giving hulls with little draft and easy beachability. Wharram also keeps freeboards low for minimum windage.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "184583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=184583", "title": "Lignum vitae", "text": "Lignum vitae\n\nLignum vitae is a wood, also called guayacan or guaiacum, and in parts of Europe known as Pockholz, from trees of the genus \"Guaiacum\". The trees are indigenous to the Caribbean and the northern coast of South America and have been an important export crop to Europe since the beginning of the 16th century. The wood was once very important for applications requiring a material with its extraordinary combination of strength, toughness, and density. It is also the national tree of the Bahamas and the Jamaican national flower. \n\nThe wood is obtained chiefly from \"Guaiacum officinale\" and \"Guaiacum sanctum\", both small, slow growing trees. All species of the genus \"Guaiacum\" are now listed in Appendix II of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) as potentially endangered species. Demand for the wood has been reduced by modern materials science, which has led to polymer, alloys and composite materials that can take lignum vitae's place.\n\n\"Lignum vitae\" is Latin for \"wood of life\", and derives its name from its medicinal uses; lignum vitae resin has been used to treat a variety of medical conditions from coughs to arthritis, and chips of the wood can also be used to brew a tea. \n\nOther names for lignum vitae include palo santo (Spanish for \"holy wood\") Aura palo santo and \"bastard greenheart\" (not to be confused with true Greenheart \"Chlorocardium rodiei\", a popular wood in shipbuilding, cabinetry, and woodturning but a completely different timber); lignum vitae is also one of the numerous hard, dense woods loosely referred to as \"ironwood\".\n\nLignum vitae is hard and durable, and is also the densest wood traded (density: 1.23 g/cm); it will easily sink in water. On the Janka Scale of Hardness, which measures hardness of woods, lignum vitae ranks highest of the trade woods, with a Janka hardness of 4500 lbf (compared with Olneya at 3260 lbf, African Blackwood at 2940 lbf, Hickory at 1820 lbf, red oak at 1290 lbf, Yellow Pine at 690 lbf, and Balsa at 100 lbf). The densest of all woods is Allocasuarina luehmannii .\n\nVarious other hardwoods may also be called lignum vitae and should not be confused with it. The best-known come from \"Bulnesia arborea\" and \"Bulnesia sarmientoi\" (in the same subfamily as \"Guaiacum\") and are known as Verawood or Argentine lignum vitae; they are somewhat similar in appearance and working qualities as genuine lignum vitae. Some hardwoods from Australasia (e.g., \"Vitex lignum-vitae\" and some species of \"Acacia\" and \"Eucalyptus\") are also referred to as lignum vitae.\n\nDue to the density of the wood, cricket bails, in particular \"heavy bails\" used in windy conditions, are sometimes made of lignum vitae. It is also sometimes used to make lawn bowls, croquet mallets, and skittles balls. The wood also has seen widespread historical usage in mortars and pestles and for wood carvers' mallets.\n\nIt was the traditional wood used for the British police truncheon until recently, due to its density (and strength), combined with the relative softness of wood compared to metal, thereby tending to bruise or stun rather than simply cut the skin.\n\nThe belaying pins and deadeyes aboard USS \"Constitution\" and many other sailing ships were made from lignum vitae. Due to its density and natural oils, they rarely require replacement, despite the severity of typical marine weathering conditions, and also resisted jamming in their mortise holes. The sheaves of blocks on sailing vessels were made of lignum vitae until the introduction of modern synthetics.\n\nDue to lignum vitae's toughness, it can also be used as a lap in the process of cutting gems. The wood is covered with powdered industrial diamond, attached to a spindle, and used to smooth rough surfaces of gems.\n\nMaster clockmaker John Harrison used lignum vitae in the bearings and gears of his pendulum clocks and his first three marine chronometers (all of which were large clocks rather than watches), since the wood is self-lubricating. The use of lignum vitae eliminates the need for horological lubricating oil; 18th-century horological oil would become viscous and reduce the accuracy of a timepiece under unfavourable conditions (including those that prevail at sea).\n\nFor the same reason it was widely used in water-lubricated shaft bearings for ships and hydro-electric power plants, and in the stern-tube bearings of ship propellers until the 1960s saw the introduction of sealed white metal bearings. According to the San Francisco Maritime National Park Association website, the shaft bearings on the WWII submarine were made of this wood. The aft main shaft strut bearings for , the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, were composed of this wood. Also, the bearings in the original 1920s turbines of the Conowingo hydroelectric plant on the lower Susquehanna River were made from lignum vitae. The shaft bearings on the horizontal turbines at the Pointe du Bois generating station in Manitoba are made from lignum vitae. Other hydroelectric plant turbine bearings, many of them still in service, were fabricated with lignum vitae and are too numerous to list here.\n\nThe United Railroads of San Francisco (an ancestor of the San Francisco Municipal Railway) began installing lignum vitae insulators to support heavy feeder wires for their trolley system in 1904. The reason for the adoption of lignum vitae was its ability to withstand the high stress at high temperature, a problem posed by heavy cables turning corners heated by high current overloads. Many of these insulators survived the 1906 earthquake and fires, despite temperatures high enough to soften the iron poles and melt the copper cables. Many of these lasted into the 1970s with a small number remaining in service into the first decade of the 2000s (most of these came down when the overhead 600 V DC feeders were replaced with a new system of underground feeders, the rest coming out of service as aging crossarms supporting the remaining overhead feeders were replaced).\n\nIt was also used extensively in the manufacture of British Railways Mark 1 Rolling Stock, as a 'bump stop' in the bogies (the 'frame' that carries the wheels).\n\nPioneering calypsonian/vaudevillian Sam Manning recorded a song entitled \"Lignum Vitae\" in the 1920s. His reference was doubly salacious, referring to both the bark tea's contraceptive qualities and the phallic symbolism of the hard wood.\n\nAccording to T. H. White's version of the King Arthur story \"The Once and Future King\", lignum vitae, from which the wand of Merlin is made, has magical powers.\n\nGabriel García Márquez's novel \"Love in the Time of Cholera\" includes a bathtub made of this wood in one of the main characters' homes. His novel \"Chronicle of a Death Foretold\" also refers to the use of this wood in making a cane for the blind Poncio Vicario.\n\nAmerican folksinger Pete Seeger fashioned the neck of his trademark banjo from lignum vitae.\n\nIn Charles Dickens' novel Bleak House, one of the characters, Matthew Bagnet is referred to as lignum vitae, \"... in compliment to the extreme hardness and toughness of his physiognomy.\"\n\nClaire Waight Keller included the tree to represent Jamaica in Meghan Markle's wedding veil, which included the distinctive flora of each Commonwealth country.\n"}

Many different cultivars have been developed at the University of California (Davis campus), by Driscoll Strawberry Associates Inc. (Watsonville, California), the United States Department of Agriculture, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and East Malling Research Station in the UK.\n\nAlmost all the strawberries listed below are cultivars of \"Fragaria\" × \"ananassa\". Two cultivars listed here ('Frel' (Pink Panda) and 'Samba' (Red Ruby)) are bigeneric hybrids, grown mainly for their flower colour rather than their fruit, using a closely related species (\"Potentilla palustris\" = \"Comarum palustre\") to introduce pink or red colouration to the flowers.\n\nThe cultivar \"Fragaria\" × \"ananassa\" 'Variegata' is grown mainly for the decorative qualities of its variegated foliage.\n\nThis table includes a list of strawberry cultivars that are commercially available.\n\nCultivar names should be shown in single quotes.

They are threatened by various human activities.\n\nThe succulent woodlands are found in the southwest and centre-west of Madagascar, in the rain shadow region that receives less moisture than the east and the Central Highlands. The climate is tropical and dry, with rainfall ranging from 575 to 1,330 mm per year, and a marked dry season from May to October.\n\nTo the north, the succulent woodlands make a transition into the Madagascar dry deciduous forests, while to the south, they border the even drier Madagascar spiny thickets and to the east, the Madagascar subhumid forests.\n\nThe vegetation is similar to the dry deciduous forests to the north, but includes more dry-adapted, xerophytic species. Forests, reaching in height, contain trees and shrubs of the families Burseraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, and Sapindaceae. Notable endemics include two species of baobab, \"Adansonia za\" and \"A. grandidieri\" (near threatened and endangered, respectively), and succulents in the genus \"Pachypodium\".\n\nBetween 60 and 90 bird species and eight lemur species are found in the ecoregion and a number of mammals, frogs, and reptiles are endemic to the area. A notable lemur species is the endangered Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, the world's smallest primate.\n\nThe Madagascar succulent woodlands are threatened by burning, logging (which impacts species such as the endemic tree \"Hazomalania voyroni\"), cattle and goat farming, and hunting of several mammals. Protected areas include Zombitse-Vohibasia National Park, Andranomena Reserve, Kirindy Mitea National Park, and Kirindy Forest.\n\n"}
{"id": "308058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=308058", "title": "Magnetic declination", "text": "Magnetic declination\n\nMagnetic declination, or magnetic variation, is the angle on the horizontal plane between magnetic north (the direction the north end of a compass needle points, corresponding to the direction of the Earth's magnetic field lines) and true north (the direction along a meridian towards the geographic North Pole). This angle varies depending on position on the Earth's surface and changes over time.\n\nSomewhat more formally, Bowditch defines variation as “the angle between the magnetic and geographic meridians at any place, expressed in degrees and minutes east or west to indicate the direction of magnetic north from true north. The angle between magnetic and grid meridians is called grid magnetic angle, grid variation, or grivation.”\n\nBy convention, declination is positive when magnetic north is east of true north, and negative when it is to the west. \"Isogonic lines\" are lines on the Earth's surface along which the declination has the same constant value, and lines along which the declination is zero are called \"agonic lines\". The lowercase Greek letter δ (delta) is frequently used as the symbol for magnetic declination.\n\nThe term \"magnetic deviation\" is sometimes used loosely to mean the same as magnetic declination, but more correctly it refers to the error in a compass reading induced by nearby metallic objects, such as iron on board a ship or aircraft.\n\nMagnetic declination should not be confused with \"magnetic inclination\", also known as magnetic dip, which is the angle that the Earth's magnetic field lines make with the downward side of the horizontal plane.\n\nMagnetic declination varies both from place to place and with the passage of time. As a traveller cruises the east coast of the United States, for example, the declination varies from 16 degrees west in Maine, to 6 in Florida, to 0 degrees in Louisiana, to 4 degrees east (in Texas). The declination at London, UK is one degree 7 minutes west (2014), and as the country is quite small that figure is fairly good for the whole. It is reducing, and scientists predict that in about 2050 it will be zero.\n\nIn most areas, the spatial variation reflects the irregularities of the flows deep in the Earth; in some areas, deposits of iron ore or magnetite in the Earth's crust may contribute strongly to the declination. Similarly, secular changes to these flows result in slow changes to the field strength and direction at the same point on the Earth.\n\nThe magnetic declination in a given area may (most likely will) change slowly over time, possibly as little as 2–2.5 degrees every hundred years or so, depending upon how far from the magnetic poles it is. For a location closer to the pole like Ivujivik, the declination may change by 1 degree every three years. This may be insignificant to most travellers, but can be important if using magnetic bearings from old charts or metes (directions) in old deeds for locating places with any precision.\n\nAs an example of how variation changes over time, see the two charts of the same area (western end of Long Island Sound), below, surveyed 124 years apart. The 1884 chart shows a variation of 8 degrees, 20 minutes West. The 2008 chart shows 13 degrees, 15 minutes West.\n\nThe magnetic declination at any particular place can be measured directly by reference to the celestial poles—the points in the heavens around which the stars appear to revolve, which mark the direction of true north and true south. The instrument used to perform this measurement is known as a \"declinometer\".\n\nThe approximate position of the north celestial pole is indicated by Polaris (the North Star). In the northern hemisphere, declination can therefore be approximately determined as the difference between the magnetic bearing and a visual bearing on Polaris. Polaris currently traces a circle 0.73° in radius around the north celestial pole, so this technique is accurate to within a degree. At high latitudes a plumb-bob is helpful to sight Polaris against a reference object close to the horizon, from which its bearing can be taken.\nA rough estimate of the local declination (within a few degrees) can be determined from a general isogonic chart of the world or a continent, such as those illustrated above. Isogonic lines are also shown on aeronautical and nautical charts.\n\nLarger-scale local maps may indicate current local declination, often with the aid of a schematic diagram. Unless the area depicted is very small, declination may vary measurably over the extent of the map, so the data may be referred to a specific location on the map. The current rate and direction of change may also be shown, for example in arcminutes per year. The same diagram may show the angle of grid north (the direction of the map's north-south grid lines), which may differ from true north.\n\nOn the topographic maps of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), for example, a diagram shows the relationship between magnetic north in the area concerned (with an arrow marked \"MN\") and true north (a vertical line with a five-pointed star at its top), with a label near the angle between the MN arrow and the vertical line, stating the size of the declination and of that angle, in degrees, mils, or both.\n\nA prediction of the current magnetic declination for a given location (based on a worldwide empirical model of the deep flows described above) can be obtained online from a web page operated by the National Geophysical Data Center, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States. This model is built with all the information available to the map-makers at the start of the five-year period it is prepared for. It reflects a highly predictable rate of change, and is usually more accurate than a map—which is likely months or years out of date—and almost never less accurate.\n\nThe National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) provides source code written in C that is based on the World Magnetic Model (WMM). The source code is free to download and includes a data file updated every five years to account for movement of the magnetic north pole.\n\nA magnetic compass points to magnetic north, not geographic north. Compasses of the style commonly used for hiking include a declination adjustment in the form of a bezel which swivels relative to the base plate. To establish a declination the bezel is rotated until the desired number of degrees plus or minus lie between the bezel’s designation N (for North) and the direction indicated by the magnetic end of the needle (usually painted red). This allows the user to establish a true bearing for travel or orientation by aligning the embossed red indicator arrow on the base plate with a landmark or heading on a map. A compass thus adjusted can be said to be reading “true north” instead of magnetic north (as long as it remains within an area on the same isogonic line).\n\nIn the image above the bezel’s N has been aligned with the direction indicated by the magnetic end of the compass needle, reflecting a magnetic declination of 0 degrees. The arrow on the base plate indicates a bearing of 307 degrees. \n\nTo work with both true and magnetic bearings, the user of a non-adjustable compass needs to make simple calculations that take into account the local magnetic declination. The example on the left shows how you would convert a magnetic bearing (one taken in the field using a non-adjustable compass) to a true bearing (one that you could plot on a map) by \"adding\" the magnetic declination. The declination in the example is 14°E (+14°). If, instead, the declination was 14°W (-14°), you would still “add” it to the magnetic bearing to obtain the true bearing: 40°+ (-14°) = 26°.\n\nThe opposite procedure is used in converting a true bearing to a magnetic bearing. With a local declination of 14°E, a true bearing (perhaps taken from a map) of 54° is converted to a magnetic bearing (for use in the field) by \"subtracting\" the declination: 54° - 14° = 40°. If, instead, the declination was 14°W (-14°), you would still “subtract” it from the true bearing to obtain the magnetic bearing: 54°- (-14°) = 68°.\nOn aircraft or vessels there are three types of bearing: true, magnetic, and compass bearing. Compass error is divided into two parts, namely magnetic variation and magnetic deviation, the latter originating from magnetic properties of the vessel or aircraft. Variation and deviation are signed quantities. As discussed above, positive (easterly) variation indicates that magnetic north is east of geographic north.\n\nCompass, magnetic and true bearings are related by:\n\nformula_1\n\nformula_2\n\nThe general equation relating compass and true bearings is\n\nformula_3\n\nWhere\n\nformula_4 is Compass bearing\n\nformula_5 is Magnetic bearing\n\nformula_6 is True bearing\n\nformula_7 is Variation\n\nformula_8 is compass Deviation\n\nformula_9 for Westerly Variation and Deviation\n\nformula_10 for Easterly Variation and Deviation\n\nTo calculate true bearing from compass bearing (and known deviation and variation):\n\n\nTo calculate compass bearing from true bearing (and known deviation and variation):\n\n\nThese rules are often combined with the mnemonic \"West is Best, East is least\"; that is to say, add W declinations when going True headings to Magnetic Compass, and subtract E ones.\n\nAnother simple way to remember which way to apply the correction for Continental USA is:\n\nCommon abbreviations are:\n\nMagnetic deviation is the angle from a given magnetic bearing to the related bearing mark of the compass. Deviation is positive if a compass bearing mark (e.g., compass north) is right of the related magnetic bearing (e.g., magnetic north) and vice versa. For example, if the boat is aligned to magnetic north and the compass' north mark points 3° more east, deviation is +3°. Deviation varies for every compass in the same location and depends on such factors as the magnetic field of the vessel, wristwatches, etc. The value also varies depending on the orientation of the boat. Magnets and/or iron masses can correct for deviation, so that a particular compass accurately displays magnetic bearings. More commonly, however, a correction card lists errors for the compass, which can then be compensated for arithmetically. Deviation must be added to compass bearing to obtain magnetic bearing.\n\nMagnetic declination has a very important influence on air navigation, since the most simple aircraft navigation instruments are designed to determine headings by locating magnetic north through the use of a compass or similar magnetic device.\n\nAviation sectionals (maps / charts) and databases used for air navigation are based on true north rather than magnetic north, and the constant and significant slight changes in the actual location of magnetic north and local irregularities in the planet's magnetic field require that charts and databases be updated at least twice each year to reflect the current magnetic variation correction from true north.\n\nFor example, as of March 2010, near San Francisco, magnetic north is about 14.3 degrees east of true north, with the difference decreasing by about 6 minutes of arc per year.\n\nWhen plotting a course, most small aircraft pilots plot a trip using true north on a sectional (map), then convert the true north bearings to magnetic north for in-plane navigation using the magnetic compass. During flight, the pilot derives the correct compass course by adding or subtracting the local variation displayed on a sectional.\n\nRadionavigation aids located on the ground, such as VORs, are also checked and updated to keep them aligned with magnetic north to allow pilots to use their magnetic compasses for accurate and reliable in-plane navigation.\n\nRunways are designated by a number between 01 and 36, which is generally one tenth of the magnetic azimuth of the runway's heading: a runway numbered 09 points east (90°), runway 18 is south (180°), runway 27 points west (270°) and runway 36 points to the north (360° rather than 0°). However, due to magnetic declination, changes in runway designators have to occur at times to keep their designation in line with the runway's magnetic heading. An exception is made for runways within the Northern Domestic Airspace of Canada; these are numbered relative to true north because proximity to the magnetic North Pole makes the magnetic declination large.\n\nGPS systems used for air navigation can use magnetic north or true north. In order to make them more compatible with systems that depend on magnetic north, magnetic north is often chosen, at the pilot's preference. The GPS receiver natively reads in true north, but can elegantly calculate magnetic north based on its true position and data tables; the unit can then calculate the current location and direction of the north magnetic pole and (potentially) any local variations, if the GPS is set to use magnetic compass readings.\n\n"}

{"id": "31260516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31260516", "title": "PKA (irradiation)", "text": "PKA (irradiation)\n\nA Primary Knock-on Atom or PKA is an atom that is displaced from its lattice site by irradiation; it is, by definition, the first atom that an incident particle encounters in the target. After it is displaced from its initial lattice site, the PKA can induce the subsequent lattice site displacements of other atoms if it possesses sufficient energy, or come to rest in the lattice at an interstitial site if it does not.\n\nMost of the displaced atoms resulting from electron irradiation and some other types of irradiation are PKAs, since these are usually below the threshold displacement energy and do not have sufficient energy to displace more atoms. In other cases like fast neutron irradiation, most of the displacements result from higher energy PKAs colliding with other atoms as they slow down to rest.\n\nAtoms can only be displaced if, upon bombardment, the energy they receive exceeds a threshold energy \"E\". Likewise, when a moving atom collides with a stationary atom, both atoms will have energy greater than \"E\" after the collision only if the original moving atom had an energy exceeding 2\"E\". Thus, only PKAs with an energy greater than 2\"E\" can continue to displace more atoms and increase the total number of displaced atoms. In cases where the PKA does have sufficient energy to displace further atoms, the same truth holds for any subsequently displaced atom.\n\nIn any scenario, the majority of displaced atoms leave their lattice sites with energies no more than two or three times \"E\". Such an atom will collide with another atom approximately every mean interatomic distance traveled, losing half of its energy during the average collision. Assuming that an atom that has slowed down to a kinetic energy of 1 eV becomes trapped in an interstitial site, displaced atoms will typically be trapped no more than a few interatomic distances away from the vacancies they leave behind.\n\nThere are several possible scenarios for the energy of PKAs, and these lead to different forms of damage. In the case of electron or gamma ray bombardment, the PKA usually does not have sufficient energy to displace more atoms. The resulting damage consists of a random distribution of Frenkel defects, usually with a distance no more than four or five interatomic distances between the interstitial and vacancy. When PKAs receive energy greater than \"E\" from bombarding electrons, they are able to displace more atoms, and some of the Frenkel defects become groups of interstitial atoms with corresponding vacancies, within a few interatomic distances of each other. In the case of bombardment by fast-moving atoms or ions, groups of vacancies and interstitial atoms widely separated along the track of the atom or ion are produced. As the atom slows down, the cross section for producing PKAs increases, resulting in groups of vacancies and interstitials concentrated at the end of the track.\n\nA thermal spike is a region in which a moving particle heats up the material surrounding its track through the solid for times of the order of 10 s. In its path, a PKA can produce effects similar to those of heating and rapidly quenching a metal, resulting in Frenkel defects. A thermal spike does not last long enough to permit annealing of the Frenkel defects.\n\nA different model called the displacement spike was proposed for fast neutron bombardment of heavy elements. With high energy PKAs, the region affected is heated to temperatures above the material’s melting point, and instead of considering individual collisions, the entire volume affected could be considered to “melt” for a short period of time. The words “melt” and “liquid” are used loosely here because it is not clear whether the material at such high temperatures and pressures would be a liquid or a dense gas. Upon melting, former interstitials and vacancies become “density fluctuations,” since the surrounding lattice points no longer exist in liquid. In the case of a thermal spike, the temperature is not high enough to maintain the liquid state long enough for density fluctuations to relax and interatomic exchange to occur. A rapid “quenching” effect results in vacancy-interstitial pairs that persist throughout melting and resolidification. Towards the end of the path of a PKA, the rate of energy loss becomes high enough to heat up the material well above its melting point. While the material is melted, atomic interchange occurs as a result of random motion of the atoms initiated by the relaxation of local strains from the density fluctuations. This releases stored energy from these strains that raises the temperature even higher, maintaining the liquid state briefly after most of the density fluctuations disappear. During this time, the turbulent motions continue so that upon resolidification, most of the atoms will occupy new lattice sites. Such regions are called displacement spikes, which, unlike thermal spikes, do not retain Frenkel defects.\n\nBased on these theories, there should be two different regions, each retaining a different form of damage, along the path of a PKA. A thermal spike should occur in the earlier part of the path, and this high-energy region retains vacancy-interstitial pairs. There should be a displacement spike towards the end of the path, a low-energy region where atoms have been moved to new lattice sites but no vacancy-interstitial pairs are retained.\n\nThe structure of cascade damage is strongly dependent on PKA energy, so the PKA energy spectrum should be used as the basis of evaluating microstructural changes under cascade damage. In thin gold foil, at lower bombardment doses, the interactions of cascades are insignificant, and both visible vacancy clusters and invisible vacancy-rich regions are formed by cascade collision sequences. The interaction of cascades at higher doses was found to produce new clusters near existing groups of vacancy clusters, apparently converting invisible vacancy-rich regions to visible vacancy clusters. These processes are dependent on PKA energy, and from three PKA spectra obtained from fission neutrons, 21 MeV self-ions, and fusion neutrons, the minimum PKA energy required to produce new visible clusters by interaction was estimated to be 165 keV.\n\n"}
{"id": "82971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=82971", "title": "Peitho", "text": "Peitho\n\nIn Greek mythology, Peitho () is the goddess who personifies persuasion and seduction. Her Roman name is Suadela or Suada.\n\nPausanias reports that after the unification of Athens, Theseus set up a cult of Aphrodite Pandemos and Peitho on the south slope of Acropolis of Athens. According to the same author, they had also a sanctuary and a cult at Sicyon. In her role as an attendant or companion of Aphrodite, Peitho was intimately connected to the goddess of love and beauty. Ancient artists and poets explored this connection in their works. The connection is even deeper in the context of Ancient Greek marriage because a suitor had to negotiate with the father of a young woman for her hand in marriage and offer a bridal price in return for her. The most desirable women drew many prospective suitors, and persuasive skill often determined their success.\n\nAphrodite and Peitho were sometimes conflated to a certain extent, with the name Peitho appearing in conjunction with, or as an epithet of, Aphrodite's name. This helps to demonstrate how the relationship between persuasion and love (or desire) was important in Greek culture. Peitho's ancestry is somewhat unclear. According to Hesiod in the \"Theogony\", Peitho was the daughter of the Titans Tethys and Oceanus, which would make her an Oceanid and therefore sister of such notable goddesses as Dione, Doris, and Metis. However, Hesiod's classification of Peitho as an Oceanid is contradicted by other sources. \n\nWhen Zeus ordered the creation of the first woman, Pandora, it was Peitho and the Charities who put golden necklaces around her neck, and the rich-haired Hours crowned Pandora's head with spring flowers. Peitho is identified as a member of the Charites by Hermesianax, and Nonnus, in his \"Dionysiaca\", describes them as including Peitho, Pasithea, and Aglaia, all three of them daughters of Dionysus and Aphrodite. She is most commonly considered a daughter of Aphrodite. Nonnus also lists Peitho as the wife of Hermes, the messenger of the gods. However, in another source, Peitho is the first wife of Phoroneus, and the mother of Aegialeus and Apia\n\n\n"}

Discovered by NOAA, the patch is estimated to contain 20 times the density of floating debris compared to the global average. The project aims to study the extent and nature of the debris with a view to capturing, detoxifying, and recycling the material, and is organised by the Ocean Voyages Institute, a California-based 501c3 non-profit organisation dealing with marine preservation. The project is based in San Francisco and Hong Kong.\n\nProject Kaisei was started in late 2008 by three co-founders from the San Francisco Bay Area, all with many years of ocean stewardship and activities behind them. As ocean lovers, Mary being a long time sailor, George a surfer and expert on surfboard design, and Doug with his open water swimming and paddling racing, each had different contacts and abilities to contribute to the group. With Doug living in Hong Kong, the group set up two points of operation on either side of the Pacific (San Francisco and Hong Kong) to help begin to bring all parties to the table to stem the flow of plastic and marine debris into our ocean.\n\nThe project was launched on 19 March 2009, with plans for an initial phase of scientific study of the plastic debris in the North Pacific Gyre and feasibility study of the recovery and recycling technologies. The goal is to bring about a global collaboration of science, technology and solutions, to help remove some of the floating waste. New catch methods for the debris are being studied, which would have low energy input and low marine life loss. Technologies for remediation or recycling are being evaluated, to potentially create secondary products from the waste, which in turn could help subsidize a larger scale cleanup. The project has completed two expeditions, one in the summer of 2009, and one in 2010. New data on the issue has been collected, and more research and planning needs to be done in order to understand the metrics and costs associated with a larger scale cleanup effort. Planning is now taking place for future research and expeditions to take place which would allow for the testing of new capture technologies and equipment, as well as the demonstration of some of the remediation or recycling technologies that could be used.\n\nIn August 2009, the initial study and feasibility voyage phase of Project Kaisei began, conducted by two vessels, the 174-foot (53-meter) diesel powered research vessel R/V \"New Horizon\", and the project flagship, the 150-foot (46-meter) tall ship \"Kaisei\". The \"New Horizon\", owned by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, left San Diego on 2 August 2009 on the Scripps Environmental Accumulation of Plastic Expedition (SEAPLEX), set to last until 21 August. The SEAPLEX expedition is funded by the University of California, San Diego, the National Science Foundation with supplemental funding from the Project Kaisei. Two days later the \"Kaisei\" a smaller tall ship, owned by the Ocean Voyages Institute, departed San Francisco on 4 August, and was expected to undertake a 30-day voyage. The \"Kaisei\" was to investigate the size and concentration of the debris field, and explore retrieval methods, while the \"New Horizon\" would join her and study the effect of the debris field on marine life.\n\nOn reaching the patch, 1,000 miles from the Californian coast, \"New Horizon\" began intensive sampling on 9 August. The crew took samples every few hours around the clock, using nets of various sizes and collecting samples at various depths. \"New Horizon\" returned on Friday 21 August 2009. SEAPLEX reported their initial findings on Thursday 27 August 2009, declaring that the patch stretched at least 1,700 miles across, and that from 100 consecutive surface samples taken along that 1,700 path track taken through the patch, plastic was found in every one. Miriam Goldstein, chief scientist of the SEAPLEX expedition described the findings as \"shocking\". Speaking about the patch, Goldstein added, \"There’s no island, there’s no eighth continent, it doesn’t look like a garbage dump. It looks like beautiful ocean. But then when you put the nets in the water, you see all the little pieces.”\n\n\"Kaisei\" returned to San Francisco on the morning of Monday 31 August. OVI founder and Project Kaisei co-founder Mary Crowley stated immediately following the Kaisei expeditions that the pollution was \"what we expected to see, or a little worse.\" Andrea Neal, principal investigator on the \"Kaisei\" speaking on Tuesday 1 September stated that \"Marine debris is the new man-made epidemic. It's that serious\". \"Kaisei\" and \"New Horizon\" together had conducted tests along over 3,500 miles of the ocean.\n\nInitial findings from the voyages concluded that the vast majority of the debris is small. The tiny portions of the debris field was said to be pervasive, and was found both at the surface and at deeper areas. It was also described as a \"nearly inconceivable amount of tiny, confettilike pieces of broken plastic\", increasing in density the further they sampled into the patch. Findings suggested that the presence of small debris, of a similar size to the existent marine life, could prove an obstacle to cleanup efforts.\n\nLarger debris found consisted of mainly plastic bottles, but also included shoe soles, plastic buckets, patio chairs, Styrofoam pieces, old toys and fishing vessel buoys, and a large collection of floating debris entangled in fishing net. Various types of marine life were found on, around and within the larger types of debris. Some of the garbage collected was put on display at the Bay Model Visitor Center in Sausalito, California.\n\nThe initial feasibility mission aimed to collect 40 tonnes of debris, using special nets designed not to catch fish, in two passes through the field. The project would later test methods of recycling the collected garbage into new plastic, or commercial products such as diesel fuel or clothing. If the initial mission proved the collection and processing technologies to be viable, it was expected that the \"Kaisei\" would lead a full scale commercial cleanup voyage with other vessels, becoming operational within 18 months.\n\nOcean Voyages Institute raised $500,000 for the Project Kaisei initial voyages. The SEAPLEX expedition cost $387,000, funded with $190,000 from UC Ship Funds, $140,000 from Project Kaisei and $57,000 from the National Science Foundation. Project Kaisei is also partnered with the California Department of Toxic Substances Control.\n\nThe group has since been recognized by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 2009 as a Climate Hero, by Google as a Google Earth Hero for its work with a video blogging voyage tracking system, and it was recently part of the Clinton Global Initiative in September 2010.\n\n\n"}

This belief is held by individuals in a great number of places around the world, including Europe, China, Africa, and North and South America. This belief likely has existed in Europe since 600 BC among Celtic people. In variations of this superstition, the donor rabbit must possess certain attributes, have been killed in a particular place, killed by a particular method, or by a person possessing particular attributes (e.g., by a cross-eyed man).\n\nThe belief in North American folklore may originate in the system of African American folk magic known as \"hoodoo\". A number of strictures attached to the charm that are now observed mostly in the breach: \n\n\nThe various rituals suggested by the sources, though they differ widely one from another, share a common element of the uncanny, and the reverse of what is considered good-omened and auspicious. A rabbit is an animal into which shapeshifting witches such as Isobel Gowdie claimed to be able to transform themselves. Witches were said to be active at the times of the full and new moons.\n\nThese widely varying circumstances may share a common thread of suggestion that the true lucky rabbit's foot is actually cut from a shapeshifted witch. The suggestion that the rabbit's foot is a substitute for a part from a witch's body is corroborated by other folklore from hoodoo. Willie Dixon's song \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" mentions a \"black cat bone\" along with his mojo and his John the Conqueror: all are artifacts in hoodoo magic. Given the traditional association between black cats and witchcraft, a black cat bone is also potentially a substitute for a human bone from a witch. Hoodoo lore also uses graveyard dust, soil from a cemetery, for various magical purposes. Dust from a good person's grave keeps away evil; dust from a sinner's grave is used for more nefarious magic. The use of graveyard dust may also be a symbolic appropriation of the parts of a corpse as a relic, and a form of sympathetic magic.\n\nIn any case, the rabbit's foot is dried out and preserved, and carried around by gamblers and other people who believe it will bring them luck. Rabbit's feet, either authentic or imitation, are frequently sold by curio shops and vending machines. Often, these rabbit's feet have been dyed various colors, and they are often turned into keychains. Few of these rabbit's feet carry any warranty concerning their provenance, or any evidence that the preparers have made any effort to comply with the rituals required by the original tradition. Some may be confected from fake fur and latex \"bones\"\n. President Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography that he had been given a gold-mounted rabbit's foot by John L. Sullivan, as well as a penholder made by Bob Fitzsimmons out of a horseshoe. A 1905 anecdote also tells that Booker T. Washington and Baron Ladislaus Hengelmuller, the ambassador from Austria, got their overcoats confused when they were both in the White House to speak with President Roosevelt; the ambassador noticed that the coat he had taken was not his when he went to the pockets searching for his gloves, and instead found \"the left hind foot of a graveyard rabbit, killed in the dark of the moon.\" Other newspaper stories reported the incident, but omitted the detail about the rabbit's foot.\n\nIn addition to being mentioned in blues lyrics, the rabbit's foot is mentioned in the American folk song \"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight\", once popular in minstrel shows; one line goes: \"And you've got a rabbit's foot To keep away de hoo-doo\".\n\nHumorist R. E. Shay is credited with the witticism, \"Depend on the rabbit's foot if you will, but remember it didn't work for the rabbit.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "35006837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35006837", "title": "Setralit", "text": "Setralit\n\nSetralit is a technical natural fiber based on plant fibers whose property profile has been modified selectively in order to meet different industrial requirements. It was first manufactured in 1989 by Jean-Léon Spehner, an Alsatian engineer, and further developed by the German company ECCO Gleittechnik GmbH. The name “Setralit“ is derived from the French company Setral S.à.r.l. which is a subsidiary company of ECCO, where Spehner was employed at that time. Setralit was officially described first in 1990.\n\nIn the late eighties and early nineties asbestos in friction pads was banned at first in Germany and subsequently in the European Union (EU). Consequently, the friction lining industry was looking for a substitute that was suitable as a reinforcing as well as a processing fiber. At the same time the EU established and subsidized a mandatory property set-aside to restrict the grain production. Only plants für use in industry could be grown on the set-aside land without affecting subsidies. Both the EU and the Federal Republic of Germany supplied money to boost the development of new materials and new manufacturing processes of such “renewable resources”, first of all for bast fiber plants like flax and – since 1996 – hemp with low THC content.\n\nAgainst this background ECCO took part in joint project for the utilization of flax fibers in brake and clutch linings, funded by the German Federal Department for Research and Technology (BMFT). During this project several Setralit fiber types were being used for the first time. They had been generated by a chemical, thermal and/or mechanical treatment of flax tow which is a side product of the textile industry. The German popular press praised this approach as a ”sensational invention“.\n\nHowever, the varying properties of the base material of first generation Setralit turned out to be a serious disadvantage because these variations affected the performance characteristics of the final product in an unforeseeable way. These differences are mainly being caused by growth and harvest conditions and as such are being influenced by the climate as well as by short-term weather fluctuations in the growing area. These effects are particularly critical during dew retting.\nIn order to avoid this problem ECCO developed an ultrasonic decomposition process (named “ultrasonic break-down“) at the end of the 90’s. Thanks to this controllable, physico-chemical extraction most of the associated material of the plant fibers (lignin, pectin, waxes, natural adhesives, fragrances and dyestuffs, as well as dust, bacteria, and fungi spores) is removed or destroyed. These second generation Setralit-fibers show an immensely smaller range of property variations compared to those of the first generation, which makes them more attractive for industrial use.\n\nFollowing this, ECCO developed a series of Setralit types for various industrial end applications in cooperation with several industry partners in the construction, plastic and paper industries. In 2005, a fibrillated Setralit fiber managed to achieve the industrial breakthrough. This type is mainly used as a substitute for aramid pulp (Kevlar, Twaron et al.) for example in friction pads.\n\nThe omnipresent political discussions about sustainability, protection of the natural resources, and reduction of global warming gases push the Setralit fiber into the focus of new industrial users.\n\nAccording to the Nova Institute, Hürth, Germany, in the future there is no alternative to the increased substantial use of agricultural raw materials. Bio-based substances such as biodegradable and durable bio plastics, natural fiber reinforced (bio) plastics (bio composites) and wood-plastic composites (WPC) form an interesting new class of materials thereby.\n\nSetralit production is two-staged. During the first step the raw material is being subjected to an aqueous ultrasonic procedure followed by washing and drying. During the second step of conditioning the so-cleaned Setralit-fiber is specifically threatened depending on its end use. In general this step is merely mechanical (cutting, grinding, fibrillating etc.), but it can also be combined with a thermal or chemical treatment. The term \"Setralit process\" means the combination of two (or more) manufacturing steps in a row. Decomposition of the plant fiber bundles leaves the basic physical properties of the elementary fibers unaffected; therefore Setralit is still identified as a natural fiber.\n\nThe chemical fiber extraction by ultrasound is controllable, as are the following conditioning processes. Thus the properties can be fitted to the requirements of the end products – within the range that nature of fiber allows.\n\nIn principle, any plant fibers can be considered as raw material. However, bast fibers of annuals (flax, hemp, jute, kenaf et al.) are preferred. Appropriate are stem fibers of perennial plants (nettle, ramie), leaf fibers (sisal, abaca, cabuja, curaua) plus seed and fruit fibers (cotton, kapok, coir). In contrast, the application of the Setralit technique to herbage (bamboo, miscanthus, bagasse, cereal, rice and corn straw) and wood has only been explored rudimentarily.\n\nThe Setralit techniques are applied either on crushed dry straw of bast fiber plants (mechanical fiber extraction) or on decorticated fibers (long fibers, flax tow). In the first case the fiber has to be separated mechanically, after the ultrasonic break-down, from its non-fibrous components (shives). As a benefit one gets clean shives as a byproduct which can serve as a raw material for high quality fiber powder. With the help of modified Setralit techniques the shives may also be upgraded separately.\n\nConcerning the technical characteristics, Setralit fibers differ remarkably from the raw fibers from which they were extracted from. The distinctive attribute of Setralit compared to a conventionally gained fiber is the reproducibility of its technical properties. These are being produced by standardized treatment processes. As conventional natural fibers mainly reflect the quality variations of the primary material, these are being evened out by ultrasonic extraction.\n\nOther differing characteristics are:\nThe different, mostly mechanical conditioning actions of step two lead to a range of well defined Setralit-types that differ in appearance as well as in technical characteristics. These properties are suited for the possible application of a certain Setralit-type. They are stated in the technical datasheet. The specification describes the permitted variation of such parameters.\nNatural fiber-pulp, cleaned, fibrillated\n\n(*2) In this context “fibril” means a part of a fiber whose diameter is smaller than one third of the original fiber (mother or stem fiber). This line is drawn arbitrarily.\n\nThe mechanical strength values of Setralit-fibers reflect those of the primary material (e.g. flax, hemp, ramie fiber). The ultrasonic procedure does not lead to a damage of the fiber. Any losses in strength properties are due only to the mechanical wear during the second processing step.\n\n(Application: friction linings) The characteristics of a fibrillated Setralit-fiber compared to a synthetic high-performance fiber (aramid pulp):\nReference:\n[1] Own measurements of ECCO Gleittechnik GmbH.\n[2] Sotton 1998: Flax a natural fibre with outstanding properties - Techtextil, Frankfurt. f\n[3] Akzo: Twaron® - The power of aramid - Informational brochure. \n[4] Final Report to Project: Ermittlung werkstoffkundlicher Merkmale von Flachsfasern “[Determination of flax fiber properties] - Institut für Kunststoffverarbeitung Aachen. f\nRemarks\na Measured on fiber bundles\nb Measured on elementary fibers\nc Determined by thermal gravimetric analysis: here defined as temperature at 5% weight loss of dry fiber (heating-up rate: 5 °C/min).\nd Here defined as mass of fibrils divided by total pulp mass.\ne Determined by another method (Blaine-Dyckerhoff: flow resistance of N2) than used by Akzo (Brunauer, Emmett, Teller: absorption of N2); equivalent to ~ 6 m²/g BET.\nf The mechanical properties of elementary flax and hemp fibers are comparable.\n\nSetralit® is a raw material for industrial manufacturing and allows multifunctional utilization.

Collectively they have a total land surface area of less than 15 km at low tide:\nThe islands are located on a shallow continental shelf with an average depth of 200 metres. However, in the Spratlys, the sea floor drastically changes its depth, and near the Philippines, the Palawan Trough is more than 5,000 metres deep. Also, there are some parts that are so shallow that navigation becomes difficult and prone to accidents.\n\nThe sea floor contains Paleozoic and Mesozoic granite and metamorphic rocks. The abysses are caused by the formation of the Himalayas in the Cenozoic.\n\nExcept one volcanic island, the islands are made of coral reefs of varying ages and formations.\n\nThese islands listed here compose the South China Sea Islands ecoregion, in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. Other islands in the South China Sea are not biogeographically included.\n\nThere are minerals, natural gas, and oil deposits on the islands and under their nearby seafloor, also an abundance of sealife, such as fish, animals and vegetation, traditionally exploited as food by all the claimant nations for thousands of years—mostly without disputes that could risk war. In the 20th century, since the WW2 settlements failed to resolve ownership of such lesser areas of land, seas and islands—and because of the economic, military, and transportational importance—their control, especially that of the Spratlys, has been in dispute between China and several Southeast Asian countries, such as Vietnam, from the mid-20th century onwards. True occupation and control are shared between the claimants (see claims and control below).\n\nThe South China Sea Islands were discussed from the 4th century BC in the Chinese texts \"Yizhoushu\", \"Classic of Poetry\", \"Zuo Zhuan\", and \"Guoyu\", but only implicitly as part of the \"Southern Territories\" () or \"South Sea\" (, \"Nán Hǎi\"). During the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC), government administrators called the South China Sea Islands the \"Three Mysterious Groups of Islands\" (, \"Sān Shén Shān\"). But during the Eastern Han dynasty (23-220), the South China Sea was renamed \"Rising Sea\" (, \"Zhǎng Hǎi\"), so the islands were called the \"Rising Sea Islands\" (, \"Zhǎnghǎi Qítóu\"). During the Jin Dynasty (265–420), they were known as the \"Coral Islands\" (, \"Shānhú Zhōu\"). From the Tang Dynasty (618–907) to the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), various names were used for the islands, but in general \"Changsha\" and permutations referred to the Paracel Islands, while \"Shitang\" referred to the Spratly Islands. These variations included, for the Paracels: \"Jiǔrǔ Luózhōu\" (), \"Qīzhōu Yáng\" (), \"Chángshā\" (), \"Qiānlǐ Chángshā\" (), and \"Qiānlǐ Shítáng\" (); for the Spratlys: \"Shítáng\" (), \"Shíchuáng\" (), \"Wànlǐ Shítáng\" (), and \"Wànlǐ Chángshā\" ().\n\nDuring the Qing, the names \"Qianli Changsha\" and \"Wanli Shitang\" were in vogue, and Chinese fishermen from Hainan named specific islands from within the groups, although the Qing officially named 15 large islands in 1909. During China's Republican era (1912-1949), the government named the Spratlys \"Tuánshā Qúndǎo\" () and then \"Nánshā Qúndǎo\" (); the Paracels were \"Xīshā Qúndǎo\" (); Republican authorities mapped over 291 islands, reefs, and banks in surveys in 1932, 1935, and 1947. The People's Republic of China has retained the Republican-era names for the island groups, supplementing them with a list of 287 names for islands, reefs, banks, and shoals in 1983. From 2011-2012, China's State Oceanic Administration named 1,660 nameless islands and islets under its claimed jurisdiction; in 2012, China announced plans to name a further 1,664 nameless features by August 2013. The naming campaign is intended to consolidate China's sovereignty claim over Sansha (), a city which includes islands from the \"Xisha\" (Paracel), \"Nansha\" (Spratly and James Shoal) and \"Zhongsha\" (, \"Zhōngshā\"; Macclesfield Bank, Scarborough Shoal, and others) groups.\n\nFrom 1405 to 1433, Zheng He commanded expeditionary voyages to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and East Africa in Ming dynasty in China. \nIn 1421, Zheng prepared the 6 edition Mao Kun map, usually referred to by Chinese people as Zheng He's Navigation Map (simplified Chinese: 郑和航海图; traditional Chinese: 鄭和航海圖; pinyin: Zhèng Hé hánghǎi tú), which included South China Sea Islands.\n\nThe countries with the most extensive activity in the South China Sea Islands are China and Vietnam.\n\nIn the 19th century, as a part of the occupation of Indochina, France claimed control of the Spratlys until the 1930s, exchanging a few with the British. During World War II, the South China Sea islands were all occupied by Japan. After the end of World War II, Japan returned all the South China Sea Islands back to China, which had been agreed by the Allied Nations.\n\nThe People's Republic of China, founded in 1949, claimed the islands as part of the province of Canton (Guangdong), and later of the Hainan special administrative region.\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC) named 132 of the South China Sea Islands in 1932 and 1935. In 1933, the Chinese government lodged an official protest to the French government after its occupation of Taiping Island. After World War II, the Chinese government received the islands from the surrendering Japanese, according to international treaties made by the Allied Nations. In 1947, the Ministry of Interior of China renamed 149 of the islands. Later, in November 1947, the Secretaritat of Guangdong Government of China was authorised to publish the \"Map of the South China Sea Islands\".\n\nThe Japanese and the French renounced their claims as soon as their respective occupations or colonisations ended.\n\nIn 1958, the People's Republic of China (PRC) issued a declaration defining its territorial waters within what is known as the nine-dotted line which encompassed the Spratly Islands. North Vietnam's prime minister, Phạm Văn Đồng, sent a diplomatic note to Zhou Enlai, stating that \"The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam respects this decision.\" The diplomatic note was written on 14 September and was publicised in \"Nhan Dan\" newspaper (Vietnam) on 22 September 1958. Regarding this letter, there have been many arguments on its true meaning and the reason why Phạm Văn Đồng decided to send it to Zhou Enlai. In an interview with BBC Vietnam, Dr. Balázs Szalontai provided the following analysis of this issue:\n\nIt was also argued that, Pham Van Dong who represented North Vietnam at that time had no legal right to comment on a territorial part which belonged to the South Vietnam represented by Ngo Dinh Diem. Therefore, the letter has no legal value and is considered as a diplomatic document to show the support of the government of North Vietnam to the PRC at that time. In China, in 1959, the islands were put under an administrative office (办事处/\"banshichu\"). In 1988, the office was switched to the administration of the newly founded Hainan Province. The PRC strongly asserted its claims to the islands, but in the late 1990s, under the new security concept, the PRC put its claims less strongly. According to the Kyodo News, in March 2010 PRC officials told US officials that they consider the South China Sea a \"core interest\" on par with Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang In July 2010 the Communist Party-controlled Global Times stated that \"China will never waive its right to protect its core interest with military means\" and a Ministry of Defense spokesman said that \"China has indisputable sovereignty of the South Sea and China has sufficient historical and legal backing\" to underpin its claims. China added a tenth-dash line to the east of Taiwan island in 2013 as a part of its official sovereignty claim to the disputed territories in the South China Sea.\n\nIn addition to the People's Republic of China and Vietnam, the Republic of China (i.e. Taiwan), Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines also claim and occupy some islands. Taiwan claims all the Spratly Islands, but occupies only one island and one shelf including Taiping Island. Malaysia occupies three islands on its continental shelf. The Philippines claim most of the Spratlys and call them the Kalayaan Group of islands, and they form a distinct municipality in the province of Palawan. The Philippines, however, occupy only eight islands. Brunei claims a relatively small area, including islands on Louisa Reef.\n\nIndonesia's claims are not on any island, but on maritime rights. (See South China Sea)\n\nThere are no known native terrestrial animals. Birds include boobies and seagulls, which are very common on the islands. Their faeces can build up to a layer from 10 mm to 1 m annually.\n\nThere are around 100–200 native plant species on the islands. For example, the Paracels have 166 native species, but later the Chinese and the Vietnamese introduced 47 more species, including peanut, sweet potato, and various vegetables.\n\n\n"}

This occurs on the June solstice, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun to its maximum extent. It is currently north of the Equator.\n\nIts Southern Hemisphere counterpart, marking the most southerly position at which the Sun can be directly overhead, is the Tropic of Capricorn. These tropics are two of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of Earth; the others being the Arctic and Antarctic Circles and the Equator. The positions of these two circles of latitude (relative to the Equator) are dictated by the tilt of Earth's axis of rotation relative to the plane of its orbit.\n\nWhen this line of latitude was named in the last centuries BC, the Sun was in the constellation Cancer (Latin for \"crab\") at the June solstice, the time each year that the Sun reaches its zenith at this latitude. Due to the precession of the equinoxes, this is no longer the case; today the Sun is in Taurus at the June solstice. The word \"tropic\" itself comes from the Greek \"trope (τροπή)\", meaning turn (change of direction, or circumstances), inclination, referring to the fact that the Sun appears to \"turn back\" at the solstices.\n\nThe Tropic of Cancer's position is not fixed, but constantly changes because of a slight wobble in the Earth's longitudinal alignment relative to its orbit around the Sun. Earth's axial tilt varies over a 41,000 year period from 22.1 to 24.5 degrees and currently resides at about 23.4 degrees. This wobble means that the Tropic of Cancer is currently drifting southward at a rate of almost half an arcsecond (0.468″) of latitude, or 15 metres, per year (it was at exactly 23° 27′N in 1917 and will be at 23° 26'N in 2045). See axial tilt and circles of latitude for further information.\n\nNorth of the tropic are the subtropics and the North Temperate Zone. The equivalent line of latitude south of the Equator is called the Tropic of Capricorn, and the region between the two, centered on the Equator, is the tropics.\n\nThere are approximately 13 hours, 35 minutes of daylight during the summer solstice. During the winter solstice, there are 10 hours, 41 minutes of daylight.\n\nStarting at the prime meridian and heading eastward, the Tropic of Cancer passes through the following countries and territories:\n\nExcluding cooler highland regions in China, the climate at the Tropic of Cancer is generally hot and dry except for easterly coastal areas where orographic rainfall can be very heavy, in some places reaching annually. Most regions on the Tropic of Cancer experience two distinct seasons: an extremely hot summer with temperatures often reaching and a warm winter with maxima around . Much land on or near the Tropic of Cancer is part of the Sahara Desert, while to the east the climate is torrid monsoonal with a short wet season from June to September and very little rainfall for the rest of the year.\n\nThe highest mountain on or adjacent to the Tropic of Cancer is Yushan in Taiwan; though it had glaciers descending as low as during the Last Glacial Maximum, none survive and at present no glaciers exist within of the Tropic of Cancer; the nearest currently surviving are the Minyong and Baishui in the Himalayas to the north and on Iztaccíhuatl to the south.\n\nAccording to the rules of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, for a flight to compete for a round-the-world speed record, it must cover a distance no less than the length of the Tropic of Cancer, cross all meridians, and end on the same airfield where it started.\n\nLength of the Tropic on 11 December 2015, at 23°26′14″N is .\n\nFor an ordinary circumnavigation the rules are somewhat relaxed and the distance is set to a rounded value of at least .\n\n\n"}

Tropical peat mostly consist of dead organic matter from trees instead of spaghnum which are commonly found in temperate peat. This soil usually contain high organic matter content, exceeding 75% with dry low bulk density around . \n\nAreas of tropical peat are found mostly in South East Asia (about 70% by area) although are also found in Africa, Central and South America and elsewhere around the Pacific Ocean. Tropical peatlands are significant carbon sinks and store large amounts of carbon and their destruction can significantly impact on the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Tropical peatlands are vulnerable to destabilisation through human and climate induced changes. Estimates of the area (and hence volume) of tropical peatland vary but a reasonable estimate is in the region of .\n\nAlthough tropical peatlands only cover about 0.25% of the Earth's land surface they contain 50,000-70,000 million tonnes of carbon (about 3% global soil carbon). In addition, tropical peatlands support diverse ecosystems and are home to a number of endangered species including the Orangutan. \n\nThe native peat swamp forests contain a number of valuable timber-producing trees plus a range of other products of value to local communities, such as bark, resins and latex. Land-use changes and fire, mainly associated with plantation development and logging (deforestation and drainage), are reducing this carbon store and contributing to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. \n\nThe problems that result from development of tropical peatland stem mainly from a lack of understanding of the complexities of this ecosystem and the fragility of the relationship between peat and forest. Once the forest is removed and the peat is drained, the surface peat oxidises and loses stored carbon rapidly to the atmosphere (as carbon dioxide). This results in progressive loss of the peat surface, leading to local flooding and, due to the large areas involved, global climate change. Failure to account for such emissions results in underestimates of the rate of increase in atmospheric GHGs and the extent of human induced climate change.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "154664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154664", "title": "Turbulence", "text": "Turbulence\n\nIn fluid dynamics, turbulence or turbulent flow is any pattern of fluid motion characterized by chaotic changes in pressure and flow velocity. It is in contrast to a laminar flow regime, which occurs when a fluid flows in parallel layers, with no disruption between those layers.\n\nTurbulence is commonly observed in everyday phenomena such as surf, fast flowing rivers, billowing storm clouds, or smoke from a chimney, and most fluid flows occurring in nature and created in engineering applications are turbulent. Turbulence is caused by excessive kinetic energy in parts of a fluid flow, which overcomes the damping effect of the fluid's viscosity. For this reason turbulence is easier to create in low viscosity fluids, but more difficult in highly viscous fluids. In general terms, in turbulent flow, unsteady vortices appear of many sizes which interact with each other, consequently drag due to friction effects increases. This would increase the energy needed to pump fluid through a pipe, for instance. However this effect can also be exploited by devices such as aerodynamic spoilers on aircraft, which deliberately \"spoil\" the laminar flow to increase drag and reduce lift.\n\nThe onset of turbulence can be predicted by a dimensionless constant called the Reynolds number, which calculates the balance between kinetic energy and viscous damping in a fluid flow. However, turbulence has long resisted detailed physical analysis, and the interactions within turbulence create a very complex situation. Richard Feynman has described turbulence as the most important unsolved problem of classical physics.\n\n\n\nTurbulence is characterized by the following features:\n\n\n\nTurbulent diffusion is usually described by a turbulent diffusion coefficient. This turbulent diffusion coefficient is defined in a phenomenological sense, by analogy with the molecular diffusivities, but it does not have a true physical meaning, being dependent on the flow conditions, and not a property of the fluid itself. In addition, the turbulent diffusivity concept assumes a constitutive relation between a turbulent flux and the gradient of a mean variable similar to the relation between flux and gradient that exists for molecular transport. In the best case, this assumption is only an approximation. Nevertheless, the turbulent diffusivity is the simplest approach for quantitative analysis of turbulent flows, and many models have been postulated to calculate it. For instance, in large bodies of water like oceans this coefficient can be found using Richardson's four-third power law and is governed by the random walk principle. In rivers and large ocean currents, the diffusion coefficient is given by variations of Elder's formula.\n\n\n\nVia this energy cascade, turbulent flow can be realized as a superposition of a spectrum of flow velocity fluctuations and eddies upon a mean flow. The eddies are loosely defined as coherent patterns of flow velocity, vorticity and pressure. Turbulent flows may be viewed as made of an entire hierarchy of eddies over a wide range of length scales and the hierarchy can be described by the energy spectrum that measures the energy in flow velocity fluctuations for each length scale (wavenumber). The scales in the energy cascade are generally uncontrollable and highly non-symmetric. Nevertheless, based on these length scales these eddies can be divided into three categories.\nThe integral time scale for a Lagrangian flow can be defined as:\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere u' is the velocity fluctuation, and formula_2 is the time lag between measurements.\n\nAlthough it is possible to find some particular solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations governing fluid motion, all such solutions are unstable to finite perturbations at large Reynolds numbers. Sensitive dependence on the initial and boundary conditions makes fluid flow irregular both in time and in space so that a statistical description is needed. The Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov proposed the first statistical theory of turbulence, based on the aforementioned notion of the energy cascade (an idea originally introduced by Richardson) and the concept of self-similarity. As a result, the Kolmogorov microscales were named after him. It is now known that the self-similarity is broken so the statistical description is presently modified. Still, a complete description of turbulence remains one of the unsolved problems in physics.\n\nAccording to an apocryphal story, Werner Heisenberg was asked what he would ask God, given the opportunity. His reply was: \"When I meet God, I am going to ask him two questions: Why relativity? And why turbulence? I really believe he will have an answer for the first.\" A similar witticism has been attributed to Horace Lamb (who had published a noted text book on Hydrodynamics)—his choice being quantum electrodynamics (instead of relativity) and turbulence. Lamb was quoted as saying in a speech to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, \"I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic.\"\n\nA more detailed presentation of turbulence with emphasis on high-Reynolds number flow, intended for a general readership of physicists and applied mathematicians, is found in the Scholarpedia articles by Benzi and Frisch and by Falkovich.\n\nThere are many scales of meteorological motions; in this context turbulence affects small-scale motions.\n\nThe onset of turbulence can be predicted by the Reynolds number, which is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces within a fluid which is subject to relative internal movement due to different fluid velocities, in what is known as a boundary layer in the case of a bounding surface such as the interior of a pipe. A similar effect is created by the introduction of a stream of higher velocity fluid, such as the hot gases from a flame in air. This relative movement generates fluid friction, which is a factor in developing turbulent flow. Counteracting this effect is the viscosity of the fluid, which as it increases, progressively inhibits turbulence, as more kinetic energy is absorbed by a more viscous fluid. The Reynolds number quantifies the relative importance of these two types of forces for given flow conditions, and is a guide to when turbulent flow will occur in a particular situation.\n\nThis ability to predict the onset of turbulent flow is an important design tool for equipment such as piping systems or aircraft wings, but the Reynolds number is also used in scaling of fluid dynamics problems, and is used to determine dynamic similitude between two different cases of fluid flow, such as between a model aircraft, and its full size version. Such scaling is not always linear and the application of Reynolds numbers to both situations allows scaling factors to be developed. \nA flow situation in which the kinetic energy is significantly absorbed due to the action of fluid molecular viscosity gives rise to a laminar flow regime. For this the dimensionless quantity the Reynolds number () is used as a guide.\n\nWith respect to laminar and turbulent flow regimes:\n\n\nThe Reynolds number is defined as\n\nwhere:\n\nWhile there is no theorem directly relating the non-dimensional Reynolds number to turbulence, flows at Reynolds numbers larger than 5000 are typically (but not necessarily) turbulent, while those at low Reynolds numbers usually remain laminar. In Poiseuille flow, for example, turbulence can first be sustained if the Reynolds number is larger than a critical value of about 2040; moreover, the turbulence is generally interspersed with laminar flow until a larger Reynolds number of about 4000.\n\nThe transition occurs if the size of the object is gradually increased, or the viscosity of the fluid is decreased, or if the density of the fluid is increased.\n\nWhen flow is turbulent, particles exhibit additional transverse motion which enhances the rate of energy and momentum exchange between them thus increasing the heat transfer and the friction coefficient.\n\nAssume for a two-dimensional turbulent flow that one was able to locate a specific point in the fluid and measure the actual flow velocity of every particle that passed through that point at any given time. Then one would find the actual flow velocity fluctuating about a mean value:\n\nand similarly for temperature () and pressure (), where the primed quantities denote fluctuations superposed to the mean. This decomposition of a flow variable into a mean value and a turbulent fluctuation was originally proposed by Osborne Reynolds in 1895, and is considered to be the beginning of the systematic mathematical analysis of turbulent flow, as a sub-field of fluid dynamics. While the mean values are taken as predictable variables determined by dynamics laws, the turbulent fluctuations are regarded as stochastic variables.\n\nThe heat flux and momentum transfer (represented by the shear stress ) in the direction normal to the flow for a given time are\n\nwhere is the heat capacity at constant pressure, is the density of the fluid, is the coefficient of turbulent viscosity and is the turbulent thermal conductivity.\n\nRichardson's notion of turbulence was that a turbulent flow is composed by \"eddies\" of different sizes. The sizes define a characteristic length scale for the eddies, which are also characterized by flow velocity scales and time scales (turnover time) dependent on the length scale. The large eddies are unstable and eventually break up originating smaller eddies, and the kinetic energy of the initial large eddy is divided into the smaller eddies that stemmed from it. These smaller eddies undergo the same process, giving rise to even smaller eddies which inherit the energy of their predecessor eddy, and so on. In this way, the energy is passed down from the large scales of the motion to smaller scales until reaching a sufficiently small length scale such that the viscosity of the fluid can effectively dissipate the kinetic energy into internal energy.\n\nIn his original theory of 1941, Kolmogorov postulated that for very high Reynolds numbers, the small scale turbulent motions are statistically isotropic (i.e. no preferential spatial direction could be discerned). In general, the large scales of a flow are not isotropic, since they are determined by the particular geometrical features of the boundaries (the size characterizing the large scales will be denoted as ). Kolmogorov's idea was that in the Richardson's energy cascade this geometrical and directional information is lost, while the scale is reduced, so that the statistics of the small scales has a universal character: they are the same for all turbulent flows when the Reynolds number is sufficiently high.\n\nThus, Kolmogorov introduced a second hypothesis: for very high Reynolds numbers the statistics of small scales are universally and uniquely determined by the kinematic viscosity and the rate of energy dissipation . With only these two parameters, the unique length that can be formed by dimensional analysis is\n\nThis is today known as the Kolmogorov length scale (see Kolmogorov microscales).\n\nA turbulent flow is characterized by a hierarchy of scales through which the energy cascade takes place. Dissipation of kinetic energy takes place at scales of the order of Kolmogorov length , while the input of energy into the cascade comes from the decay of the large scales, of order . These two scales at the extremes of the cascade can differ by several orders of magnitude at high Reynolds numbers. In between there is a range of scales (each one with its own characteristic length ) that has formed at the expense of the energy of the large ones. These scales are very large compared with the Kolmogorov length, but still very small compared with the large scale of the flow (i.e. ). Since eddies in this range are much larger than the dissipative eddies that exist at Kolmogorov scales, kinetic energy is essentially not dissipated in this range, and it is merely transferred to smaller scales until viscous effects become important as the order of the Kolmogorov scale is approached. Within this range inertial effects are still much larger than viscous effects, and it is possible to assume that viscosity does not play a role in their internal dynamics (for this reason this range is called \"inertial range\").\n\nHence, a third hypothesis of Kolmogorov was that at very high Reynolds number the statistics of scales in the range are universally and uniquely determined by the scale and the rate of energy dissipation .\n\nThe way in which the kinetic energy is distributed over the multiplicity of scales is a fundamental characterization of a turbulent flow. For homogeneous turbulence (i.e., statistically invariant under translations of the reference frame) this is usually done by means of the \"energy spectrum function\" , where is the modulus of the wavevector corresponding to some harmonics in a Fourier representation of the flow velocity field :\n\nwhere is the Fourier transform of the flow velocity field. Thus, represents the contribution to the kinetic energy from all the Fourier modes with , and therefore,\n\nwhere is the mean turbulent kinetic energy of the flow. The wavenumber corresponding to length scale is . Therefore, by dimensional analysis, the only possible form for the energy spectrum function according with the third Kolmogorov's hypothesis is\n\nwhere would be a universal constant. This is one of the most famous results of Kolmogorov 1941 theory, and considerable experimental evidence has accumulated that supports it.\n\nIn spite of this success, Kolmogorov theory is at present under revision. This theory implicitly assumes that the turbulence is statistically self-similar at different scales. This essentially means that the statistics are scale-invariant in the inertial range. A usual way of studying turbulent flow velocity fields is by means of flow velocity increments:\n\nthat is, the difference in flow velocity between points separated by a vector (since the turbulence is assumed isotropic, the flow velocity increment depends only on the modulus of ). Flow velocity increments are useful because they emphasize the effects of scales of the order of the separation when statistics are computed. The statistical scale-invariance implies that the scaling of flow velocity increments should occur with a unique scaling exponent , so that when is scaled by a factor ,\n\nshould have the same statistical distribution as\n\nwith independent of the scale . From this fact, and other results of Kolmogorov 1941 theory, it follows that the statistical moments of the flow velocity increments (known as \"structure functions\" in turbulence) should scale as\n\nwhere the brackets denote the statistical average, and the would be universal constants.\n\nThere is considerable evidence that turbulent flows deviate from this behavior. The scaling exponents deviate from the value predicted by the theory, becoming a non-linear function of the order of the structure function. The universality of the constants have also been questioned. For low orders the discrepancy with the Kolmogorov value is very small, which explain the success of Kolmogorov theory in regards to low order statistical moments. In particular, it can be shown that when the energy spectrum follows a power law\n\nwith , the second order structure function has also a power law, with the form\n\nSince the experimental values obtained for the second order structure function only deviate slightly from the value predicted by Kolmogorov theory, the value for is very near to (differences are about 2%). Thus the \"Kolmogorov − spectrum\" is generally observed in turbulence. However, for high order structure functions the difference with the Kolmogorov scaling is significant, and the breakdown of the statistical self-similarity is clear. This behavior, and the lack of universality of the constants, are related with the phenomenon of intermittency in turbulence. This is an important area of research in this field, and a major goal of the modern theory of turbulence is to understand what is really universal in the inertial range.\n\n\n"}
