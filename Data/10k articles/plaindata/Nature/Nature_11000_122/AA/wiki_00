She was born in New Orleans, Louisiana and grew up in the 3rd Ward. 3D Na'Tee has been featured on several national media outlets such as MTV, The Source Magazine, XXL Magazine, The Fader Magazine, RapRadar and RapRehab. She has also received attention from Louisiana newspapers and music magazines.\n\nIn her middle school years, 3D Na'Tee honed her skills by what is called in New Orleans, ribbin' (rib - ing). Most people know this as \"Playing the Dozens\". Someone would start a beat by beating on a lunch room table or a garbage can, and off she went, lyrically attacking someone who was bold enough to test her skill. The rhymes were mostly about what they were wearing, how lame they were, or silly they looked.\n\nIn 1999, she began recording with local label called Clientell Records. Over the next five years, she would record multiple mixtapes under the \"Snypa Squad\" and feature on other projects Clientell Records came out with. However, in 2006, a year after Hurricane Katrina, Clientell Records dismantled and 3D Na'Tee, who had previously established herself as a battler rapper amongst the local rap scene in New Orleans, released her first mix tape project \"3's Company Vol.1: The Rapper, The Hustler, the Diva\" followed by Volume 2 in 2007. After the release of her second project, she appeared on The Kush 2 DVD which was produced by YMCMB president Mack Maine. The DVD featured other Cash Money/Young Money artist like Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, and Birdman as well as Curren$y of Warner Bros. Records\n\nAfter the local success of her first two releases and her critically acclaimed appearance on The Kush 2, she released her third mix tape Heavy Is the head That Wears The Crown followed by a music video for a song she titled, Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner. That video piqued the interest of G-Unit Records affiliate and Shade 45 Sirius XM radio host Nelson Gomez who invited her to New York for an interview on his XM show as well as on rapper 50 Cents' wildly popular ThisIs50.com website. Soon after, the talk of her third release also got her featured in HipHop Weekly Magazine by Benzino, former co-owner of The Source Magazine.\n\nBecause of video releases like Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner which spoofed many mainstream hip hop artists, 3D Na'Tee's music has been described as controversial and sometimes offensive. That song also shared the title of her for mix tape released in 2010.\n\nGuess Who's Coming 2 Dinner (The Mixtape) lead to 3D Na'Tee being nominated for a total of 5 Nola HipHop Awards by her in her home town at the NOLA Hiphop Awards. She won three awards (the most awards won by a single artist) for Lyricist of the Year, Mixtape of the Year, and Female Artist of the Year. The mixtape included collaborations from Curren$y (courtesy of Warner Bros. Records), Ebony Eyez, and Babs Bunny (formally of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs) founded group, Da Band.\n\nIn early 2011 3D Na'Tee was featured on MTV's SuckerFree Freestyle hosted by DJ Envy. 3D Na'Tee and Syleena collaborated on a song called Go Head.\n\nJuly 27, 2011 3D Na'Tee released a video for Switch which she shot and edited herself. The song included several previously released instrumental versions of songs produced by super producer Timbaland. This video gained her a nomination for Director of the Year and an award for Video of the Year. Because of the momentum the Switch video gained the day of its release, Timbaland viewed it online and in less than 24 hours, flew 3D Na'Tee to Miami's Hit Factory Studio to work with her on her next project, The Coronation. After several months spent traveling with Timbaland and other artist signed to his label, a contract was presented to 3D Na'Tee to sign to Timbaland's production company Mosely Music Group and to be managed by members of Timbaland's management team. 3D Na'Tee and Timbaland later announced via Twitter that she was no longer a part of Timbaland's company because she decided not to sign the contract presented. In a later interview, 3D Na'Tee explained that there was no ill feelings towards Timbaland and cited her reasons for not signing were strictly because of contractual clauses that could not be agreed upon.\n\nExactly two years after 3D Na'Tee's last mix tape release, she released her highly anticipated street album \"The Coronation\" which featured artists like Keri Hilson, Young Fletcher, and Lyrica Anderson. The Coronation also featured production from Mizay Entertainment's Lex Luger, Maybach Music Group's Yung Shun, Heartbeatz, Casa Di, Versive Manhattan, Serious Beats, Da Smokestarz, among others.\n\nIn August 2012 it was announced by DJ Skee, Sirius Satellite Radio Host, that the first release from The Coronation entitled NO LOVE produced by MMG's Young Shun was the #9 most requested song in the country. The Coronation's second release, Lil Kim produced by Casa Di gained tons of recognition as well as it was featured on both The Source and The Fader Magazines' websites. Lil Kim was a cautionary tale of a young girl with an absentee father who, because of her father's absence, unfortunately grew up and \"fell in love\" too fast. The song and its video (directed by Charley Mac), gained a lot of attention from tons of hiphop artist like Trina, Missy Elliott, and Grammy Award Winning Chamillionaire, who featured 3D Na'Tee's video on his famed social site www.chamillionaire.com.\n\n\n"}

This is part of the larger miombo ecosystem that covers much of eastern and southern Africa.\n\nThis area of savanna and woodland covers an area of plateau and gentle hills in central Angola, in the Cubango-Zambezi Basin which drains into the Zambezi River to the east. The area lies east of the range of hills that parallel the Atlantic coast and north of the Kalahari Desert reaching up as far as the rainforests of the Congo.\n\nIt has a tropical climate, wetter than the surrounding savanna, with most of the rain falling in the hotter summer months (November–March).\n\nThe flora is moist deciduous broadleaf savanna and woodland. Between these areas is open grassland. Three species of tree dominate miombo woodland: \"Brachystegia\", \"Julbernardia\", and \"Isoberlinia\". Under the trees there is a rich variety of other flora while the grassland areas in the region lie on sandy soil. One particular feature of miombo woodland is its vulnerability to fire, as the area is dry most of the year round.\n\nFauna inhabiting the area include a number of bird species and mammals including the giant sable antelope. Endemic mammals include Vernay's climbing mouse (\"Dendromus vernayi\"). Large mammals include giraffe (in the wetter areas), bushbuck (\"Tragelaphus scriptus\"), blue duiker (\"Cephalophus monticola\") and yellow-backed duiker (\"C. silvicultor\") in the thickly wooded areas and giraffe, sitatunga (\"Tragelaphus spekei\") and waterbuck (\"Kobus ellipsiprymnus\") in the wetter areas, with tsessebe (\"Damaliscus lunatus\") in the grasslands.\n\nOther large mammals found in the ecoregion include hippopotamus (\"Hippopotamus amphibius\"), zebra (\"Equus burchellii\"), and their predators such as lion (\"Panthera leo\"), leopard (\"P. pardus\"), cheetah (\"Acinonyx jubatus\"), African wild dog (\"Lycaon pictus\"), side-striped jackal (\"Canis adustus\") and spotted hyaena (\"Crocuta crocuta\") as well as smaller carnivores such as wild cat (\"Felis sylvestris\"), serval (\"F. serval\"), caracal (\"F. caracal\") and, appropriately the Angolan genet (\"Genetta angolensis\"). Before the Angolan Civil War in the 1970s the area was home to large populations of elephants and black rhinoceros but these have almost completely been removed, mainly by poachers.\n\nThe only known endemic bird species is the black-tailed cisticola (\"Cisticola melanura\") although there is a fairly rich selection of bird life. Following rains the following can be found in the wetlands: greater swamp-warbler (\"Acrocephalus rufescens\"), African yellow warbler (\"Iduna natalensis\"), chirping cisticola (\"Cisticola pipiens\"), Bocage's weaver (\"Ploceus temporalis\"), saddle-billed stork (\"Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis\"), marabou stork (\"Leptoptilos crumeniferus\"), Goliath heron (\"Ardea goliath\"), and wattled crane (\"Bugeranus carunculatus\").\n\nAmphibians are less common. They include two endemic frog species, \"Hildebrandtia ornatissima\" and \"Leptopelis anchietae\", plus one that is found almost entirely in this region, \"Hyperolius vilhenai\".\n\nFinally, in miombo woodland the many termites and caterpillars play an important role in clearing leaves.\n\nTowns and cities in the region include Kuito, Menongue and Luena all areas that saw much conflict during the 1975-2002 Angolan Civil War.\n\nThe intense and long-lasting civil war has caused immense damage to this environment, leaving the forests exposed to poaching and uncontrolled clearance, and conservation has obviously become a low priority issue for the government. Also due to this conflict the area cannot be properly studied by scientists. However the woodland is not threatened by clearance for agriculture or logging as along with the effects of war there are other factors keeping the population of the region to a minimum; the sandy soil does not sustain agriculture, and the woods and grassland are rife with tsetse fly. Some forest is being cleared on the edge of towns or for strip-mining.\n\nThere are a number of Angolan national parks in the area, but these have had to be abandoned at various periods due to the fighting. One of these in particular Cangandala National Park is an important haven for the giant sable antelope.\n\n"}

The three main canals (Herengracht, Prinsengracht and Keizersgracht), dug in the 17th century during the Dutch Golden Age, form concentric belts around the city, known as the Grachtengordel. Alongside the main canals are 1550 monumental buildings. The 17th-century canal ring area, including the Prinsengracht, Keizersgracht, Herengracht and Jordaan, were listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010, contributing to Amsterdam's fame as the \"Venice of the North\".\n\nMuch of the Amsterdam canal system is the successful outcome of city planning. In the early part of the 17th century, with immigration rising, a comprehensive plan was put together, calling for four main, concentric half-circles of canals with their ends resting on the IJ Bay. Known as the \"grachtengordel\", three of the canals are mostly for residential development (Herengracht or ‘’Patricians' Canal’’; Keizersgracht or ‘’Emperor's Canal’’; and Prinsengracht or ‘’Prince's Canal’’), and a fourth, outer canal, the Singelgracht, for purposes of defense and water management. The plan also envisaged interconnecting canals along radii; a set of parallel canals in the Jordaan quarter (primarily for the transportation of goods, for example, beer); the conversion of an existing, inner perimeter canal (Singel) from a defensive purpose to residential and commercial development; and more than one hundred bridges. The defensive purpose of the Nassau/Stadhouderskade was served by moat and earthen dikes, with gates at transit points but otherwise no masonry superstructures.\n\nConstruction proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic windshield wiper as the historian Geert Mak calls it – \"not\" from the center outwards as a popular myth has it. Construction of the north-western sector was started in 1613 and was finished around 1625. After 1664, building in the southern sector was started, although slowly because of an economic depression. The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel river and the IJ Bay, was not implemented for a long time. In the following centuries, the land went mostly for park, the Botanical garden, old age homes, theaters and other public facilities – and for waterways without much plan. Several parts of the city and of the urban area are polders, recognizable by their postfix \"-meer\" meaning 'lake', such as Aalsmeer, Bijlmermeer, Haarlemmermeer, and Watergraafsmeer. The canals in Amsterdam are now used for tourism, recreation, house boats, and a relatively small amount of private transport compared to the main modes of walking, light rail, subway, and bicycle. Most of the canals are paralleled by automobile roads on both sides.\n\nInward to outward, the canals are as follows:\n\nSingel encircled the medieval city of Amsterdam. It served as a moat around the city from 1480 until 1585, when Amsterdam expanded beyond Singel. The canal runs from the IJ Bay, near Central Station, to the Muntplein square, where it meets the Amstel river. It is now the inner-most canal in Amsterdam's semicircular ring of canals. The canal should not be confused with Singelgracht canal, which became the outer limit of the city during the Dutch Golden Age in the 17th Century.\n\nHerengracht (Patricians' Canal or Lords' Canal) is the first of the three major canals in the city centre of Amsterdam. The canal is named after the heren regeerders who governed the city in the 16th and 17th century. The most fashionable part is called the Golden Bend, with many double wide mansions, inner gardens and coach houses on Keizersgracht. Samuel Sarphati (1813-1868) lived at the house at number 598 and Peter the Great stayed at the house at number 527 during his second visit to Amsterdam.\n\nKeizersgracht (literal English translation: Emperor's Canal) is the second and widest of the three major canals in the city centre of Amsterdam, in between Herengracht and Prinsengracht. It is named after Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. John Adams stayed at the house at number 529, Heinrich Schliemann worked for almost three years at number 71, Daniel Fahrenheit at 463-465, and during his first visit to Amsterdam (1693), Peter the Great stayed at the house at number 317.\n\nThe Homomonument (Gay Monument) faces the Keizersgracht.\n\nPrinsengracht (Prince's Canal) is the fourth and the longest of the main canals in Amsterdam. It is named after the Prince of Orange. Most of the canal houses along it were built during the Dutch Golden Age of the United Provinces. The bridges over the Prinsengracht canal connect with the streets in the Jordaan.\n\nNotable buildings along Prinsengracht include the Noorderkerk (Northern Church), the Noordermarkt (Northern Market), Anne Frank House, and the Westerkerk (Western Church, Amsterdam's tallest church).\n\nAnnually, the Prinsengrachtconcert is held on a pontoon in the canal in front of Hotel Pulitzer.\n\nZwanenburgwal is a canal and street in the center of Amsterdam. The painter Rembrandt and philosopher Spinoza lived here. In 2006 it was voted one of the most beautiful streets in Amsterdam by readers of \"Het Parool\", a local daily newspaper.\n\nZwanenburgwal flows from Sint Antoniessluis sluice gate (between the streets Sint Antoniesbreestraat and Jodenbreestraat) to the Amstel river. The canal was originally named \"Verversgracht\" (\"dyers' canal\"), after the textile industry that once dominated this part of town. Dyed textiles were hung to dry along the canal.\n\nBrouwersgracht is a canal in the city centre of Amsterdam and is part of the canal belt connecting the Singel, Herengracht, Keizergracht and Prinsengracht and marks the northern border of the canal belt. The canal served as a site for ships returning from Asia with spices and silks, therefore Brouwersgracht had many warehouses and storage depots for the ships inventories. Likewise some officials of the Dutch East India Company lived here such as their cartographer (1708-1743) Isaak de Graaf. Breweries were also prevalent in the area due to the access to fresh water shipments. Today the warehouses are now apartments, some of the most expensive in Amsterdam. Houseboats also are seen in the canal. In 2007, Brouwersgracht was voted the most beautiful street in Amsterdam by readers of \"Het Parool\", a national daily newspaper.\n\nKloveniersburgwal is a canal running south from Nieuwmarkt to the Amstel River on the edge of the medieval city. The east side became populated in the 17th century and has a few grand mansions, like the Trippenhuis, now housing the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). Kloveniersburgwal was popular with administrators at the Dutch East India Company, being close to its nerve center on Oude Hoogstraat and its warehouse.\n\nThese four canals are the newest in Amsterdam, constructed on Java Island in 1995, a manmade island in the IJ Harbor, north-east of the City Center. The canals are lined with modern interpretations of classic Amsterdam canal houses, which were designed by 19 young Dutch architects. Each house is 4.5 meters wide and 4 or 5 stories tall, but the designs are totally unique and are often featured in Amsterdam travel guides despite being off the beaten path of most tourists. Nine ornate metal bridges, designed by artist couple Guy Rombouts and Monika Droste, cross the canals for pedestrians and cyclists.\n\n"}

The quadrilateral garden is divided by walkways or flowing water into four smaller parts.\n\nThe quadrilateral Charbagh concept is based on the four gardens of Paradise mentioned in Chapter (Surah) 55, Ar-Rahman \"The Beneficient\", in the Qur'an:\n\n\"And for him, who fears to stand before his Lord, are two gardens.\" (Chapter 55: Verse 46)<br>\n\"And beside them are two other gardens.\" (Chapter 55: Verse 62)\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Charbagh garden is the four-part garden laid out with axial paths that intersect at the garden's centre. This highly structured geometrical scheme, called the chahar bagh, became a powerful method for the organization and domestication of the landscape, itself a symbol of political territory.\n\nThe Chahrbagh-e Abbasi (or Charbagh Avenue) in Isfahan, Iran, built by Shah Abbas the Great in 1596, and the garden of the Taj Mahal in India are the most famous examples of this style. In the Charbagh at the Taj Mahal, each of the four parts contains sixteen flower beds.\n\nIn India, the Char Bagh concept in imperial mausoleums is seen in Humayun's Tomb in Delhi in a monumental scale. Humayan's father was the Central Asian Conqueror Babur who succeeded in laying the basis for the Mughal dynasty in the Indian Subcontinent and became the first Mughal emperor. The tradition of paradise garden originated among the Mughals, originally from Central Asia, which is found at Babur's tomb, Bagh-e Babur, in Kabul. \nThis tradition gave birth to the Mughal gardens design and displayed its high form in the Taj Mahal — built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, the great, great, grandson of the Central Asian Conqueror Babur, as a tomb for his favourite Indian wife Mumtaz Mahal, in Agra, India. Here, unlike most such tombs, the mausoleum is not in the centre of the garden, but on its northern end. The garden features Italian cypress trees (\"Cupressus sempervirens\") that symbolize death. Fruit trees in the garden symbolize life. The garden attracts many birds, which are considered one of the features of the garden.\n\nIn Pakistan, the Mughal Shalimar Gardens and the garden in the Tomb of Jehangir in Lahore are based on the Charbagh concept.\n\nA charbagh is located on the roof top of the Ismaili Centre in South Kensington, London. The Delegation of the Ismaili Imamat, located on Sussex Drive in the Canadian capital Ottawa, Ontario contains a charbagh in a modern setting. The Ismaili Center and Aga Khan Museum in Toronto features a modern interpretation of a charbagh between the buildings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8688", "title": "Deccan Traps", "text": "Deccan Traps\n\nDeccan Traps are a large igneous province located on the Deccan Plateau of west-central India (17°–24°N, 73°–74°E) and are one of the largest volcanic features on Earth. They consist of multiple layers of solidified flood basalt that together are more than thick, cover an area of , and have a volume of . Originally, the Deccan Traps may have covered , with a correspondingly larger original volume.\n\nThe term \"trap\" has been used in geology since 1785–1795 for such rock formations. It is derived from the Swedish word for stairs (\"trappa\") and refers to the step-like hills forming the landscape of the region.\n\nThe Deccan Traps began forming 66.25 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period. The bulk of the volcanic eruption occurred at the Western Ghats some 66 million years ago. This series of eruptions may have lasted less than 30,000 years in total.\n\nThe original area covered by the lava flows is estimated to have been as large as 1.5 million km², approximately half the size of modern India. The Deccan Traps region was reduced to its current size by erosion and plate tectonics; the present area of directly observable lava flows is around .\n\nThe release of volcanic gases, particularly sulfur dioxide, during the formation of the traps contributed to climate change. Data point to an average drop in temperature of 2 °C in this period.\n\nBecause of its magnitude, scientists have speculated that the gases released during the formation of the Deccan Traps played a role in the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) extinction event (also known as the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction). It has been theorized that sudden cooling due to sulfurous volcanic gases released by the formation of the traps and toxic gas emissions may have contributed significantly to the K–Pg, as well as other mass extinctions. However, the most popular current consensus among the scientific community is that the extinction was triggered by the Chicxulub impact event in North America (which would have produced a sunlight-blocking dust cloud that killed much of the plant life and reduced global temperature, called an impact winter).\n\nWork published in 2014 by geologist Gerta Keller and others on the timing of the Deccan volcanism suggests the extinction may have been caused by both the volcanism and the impact event. This was followed by a similar study in 2015.\n\nWithin the Deccan Traps at least 95% of the lavas are tholeiitic basalts. Other rock types present include: alkali basalt, nephelinite, lamprophyre and carbonatite.\n\nMantle xenoliths have been described from Kachchh (northwestern India) and elsewhere in the western Deccan.\n\nThe Deccan Traps are famous for the beds of fossils that have been found between layers of lava. Particularly well known species include the frog \"Oxyglossus pusillus\" (Owen) of the Eocene of India and the toothed frog \"Indobatrachus\", an early lineage of modern frogs, which is now placed in the Australian family Myobatrachidae. The Infratrappean and Intertrappean Beds also contain fossil freshwater mollusks.\n\nIt is postulated that the Deccan Traps eruption was associated with a deep mantle plume. The area of long-term eruption (the hotspot), known as the Réunion hotspot, is suspected of both causing the Deccan Traps eruption and opening the rift that once separated the Seychelles plateau from India. Seafloor spreading at the boundary between the Indian and African Plates subsequently pushed India north over the plume, which now lies under Réunion island in the Indian Ocean, southwest of India. The mantle plume model has, however, been challenged.\n\nData continue to emerge which supports the plume model. The motion of the Indian tectonic plate and the eruptive history of the Deccan traps show strong correlations. Based on data from marine magnetic profiles, a pulse of unusually rapid plate motion begins at the same time as the first pulse of Deccan flood basalts, which is dated at 67 million years ago. The spreading rate rapidly increased and reached a maximum at the same time as the peak basaltic eruptions. The spreading rate then dropped off, with the decrease occurring around 63 million years ago, by which time the main phase of Deccan volcanism ended. This correlation is seen as driven by plume dynamics.\n\nThe Indian and African plates' motions have also been shown to be coupled, with the common element being the position of these plates relative to the location of the Réunion plume head. The onset of accelerated motion of India coincides with a large slowing of the rate of counterclockwise rotation of Africa. The close correlations between the plate motions suggest that they were both driven by the force of the Réunion plume.\n\nThere is some evidence to link the Deccan Traps eruption to the asteroid impact which created the Chicxulub crater in the Mexican state of Yucatán. Although the Deccan Traps began erupting well before the impact, argon-argon dating suggests that the impact may have caused an increase in permeability that allowed magma to reach the surface and produced the most voluminous flows, accounting for around 70% of the volume. The combination of the asteroid impact and the resulting increase in eruptive volume may have been responsible for the mass extinctions that occurred at the time that separates the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods, known as the K–Pg boundary.\n\nA geological structure that exists in the sea floor off the west coast of India has been suggested as a possible impact crater, in this context called the Shiva crater. It has also been dated at approximately 66 million years ago, potentially matching the Deccan traps. The researchers claiming that this feature is an impact crater suggest that the impact may have been the triggering event for the Deccan Traps as well as contributing to the acceleration of the Indian plate in the early Paleogene.

{"id": "10580575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10580575", "title": "Energy in Iran", "text": "Energy in Iran\n\nEnergy in Iran describes energy and electricity production, consumption, import and export in Iran. Iran has the fourth largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves in the world.\n\nIran is an energy superpower.\n\nIran is in a constant battle to use its energy resources more effectively in the face of subsidization and the need for technological advances in energy exploration and production. Energy wastage in Iran amounts to six or seven billion dollars (2008). The energy consumption in the country is extraordinarily higher than international standards. Iran recycles 28 percent of its used oil and gas whereas the figure for certain countries stands at 60 percent. Iran paid $84 billion in subsidies for oil, gas and electricity in 2008. Iran is one of the most energy-intensive countries of the world, with per capita energy consumption 15 times that of Japan and 10 times that of European Union. Also due to huge energy subsidies, Iran is one of the most energy inefficient countries of the world, with the energy intensity three times higher than global average and 2.5 times the middle eastern average. Half of the country’s energy is wasted in domestic sector, 3.4 of which is wasted through single-occupancy vehicle use and 2/3 parts of power plants' energy are also wasted.\n\nIran is one of the leading members of OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) and the Organization of Gas Exporting Countries (GECF). Iran received $47 billion in oil export revenues, which accounts for about 50% of state revenues. Natural gas and oil consumption both account for about half of Iran’s domestic energy consumption. With its heavy dependence on oil and gas revenues Iran continues to explore for new sources of natural gas and oil. Recently Iran has focused its energy sector on the exploration of the South Pars offshore natural gas fields in the Persian Gulf.\n\nIran has become self-sufficient in designing, building and operating dams and power plants and it has won a good number of international bids in competition with foreign firms.\n\nEnergy generation capacity of Iranian thermal power plants reached 173 terawatt hours in 2007. Accounting for 17.9 percent of energy production in the Middle East and African region. Natural gas has been the main energy in Iran in 2007, comprising over 55 percent of energy needs, while oil and hydroelectricity accounted for 42 and 2 percent respectively. The region’s energy need will increase by 26.8 percent until 2012.\n\nEnergy plays an important role in Iranian politics. Robert Baer in his book \"The Devil We Know: Dealing with the New Iranian Superpower\" argues that Iran has attained the status of an energy superpower and is on its way to become a military-political superpower.\n\nIran plans to create an energy saving company in conjunction with the Iranian subsidy reform plan (2014). \n\nIran has the second largest oil reserves in the world, and the third largest exporter of it. According to 2006 estimates Iran produced about five percent of total global crude oil production. They produced of total liquids and 3.8 million of those barrels were crude oil. Iran plans to invest $100 billion during the next four years in different sections of its oil industry (2009). By the end of 2009, Iranian oil R/P ratio was 89.4 years which is the world's highest. By 2009, Iran had 52 active rigs and 1,853 producing oil wells.\n\nIran possesses abundant fuels from which to generate energy. Since 1913 Iran has been a major oil-exporting country. Oil industry output averaged per day in 2005, compared with the peak output of reached in 1974. Following the 1979 revolution, however, the government reduced daily oil production in accordance with an oil conservation policy. Further production declines occurred as result of damage to oil facilities during the war with Iraq. In the early 2000s, industry infrastructure was increasingly inefficient because of technological lags. Few exploratory wells were drilled in 2005. Iranian oil was nationalized in 1953 and thus is owned and operated by the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC).\n\nIran held 10.3% of the world's total proven oil reserves and that figures out to be about of oil reserves at the end of 2009. Oil also is found in northern Iran and in the offshore waters of the Persian Gulf. Nevertheless, in 2005 Iran spent US$4 billion on gasoline imports, mainly because of contraband and inefficient domestic use that result from subsidies. Iran is one of the largest gasoline consumers in the world ranking second behind United States in consumption per car.\n\nThere is a growing recognition that prices must rise faster to curb consumption and ease the burden on the public finances. Cheap energy has encouraged wasteful consumption in Iran, and a brisk business in smuggling petrol into Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Demand has also been supported by rapid increases in car production in recent years. In the absence of imports, the car industry has developed strongly (albeit from a low base) with output reaching over 1m vehicles in fiscal year 2006/07 (March 21 – March 20).\nThe growth in consumption of domestically produced oil has been modest, owing to refining constraints. By contrast, fuel imports rose to in January 2005 from in 2000, and petrol consumption is estimated to have been around in 2007 (before rationing), of which about one-third is imported. These imports are proving expensive, costing the government about US$4bn in the first nine months of 2007/08, according to parliamentary sources. Nearly 40% of refined oil consumed by Iran is imported from India.\n\nIran contains 27 onshore and 13 offshore oil-producing fields, largely concentrated in the southwestern Khuzestan region near the Iraqi border. The Iranian government is heavily reliant on oil revenues and they have heavily subsidized the energy industries, which figures out to be about 12% of Iran’s GDP. However, domestic oil consumption has decreased due to the alternative use of natural gas. Economic growth from these resources is uncertain and stunted in Iran due to these subsidies and population growth. Iran has been unable to reach it full production levels due to a combination of sanctions and war plaguing the region. Iran’s oil fields have a natural decline rate at 8 percent for onshore wells and 10% for offshore fields. The Iranian recovery rate is currently approximately 27 percent, which is well below the world average. Iran needs structural improvements made to coincide with their enhanced oil recovery efforts.\n\nIran is the world's third producer of natural gas (5.1% of the world's total and 184 BCM); which is primarily used for domestic electricity generation or heat production. It contains an estimated (Tcf) in proven natural gas reserves. In 2005 a large share of Iran’s natural gas reserves were believed to remain untapped. About 62% of these reserves are located in non-associated fields. Iranian production of natural gas is expected to increase over the next few years due to continuing discoveries in the North Pars and South Pars regions.\n\nDomestic consumption has matched production at in the year of 2005. Domestic consumption is expected to go up at about 7% per year for the following decade. The Iranian government has also subsidized natural gas prices along with gasoline prices, and this is expected to sustain this high level of domestic consumption. In lieu of this increasing domestic demand, natural gas exports are expected to decrease in the following years.\n\nIran has the third largest consumption of natural gas in the world after United States and Russia. Iran also has the world's largest growth rate in natural gas consumption.\n\nIran’s domestic consumption and production have steadily grown together since 1984 and it is still heavily reliant on traditional thermal energy sources of electricity, with a small fraction being produced by hydroelectric plants. Consumption has steadily risen and it is expected to rise at about 6 percent per year for the following decade. Accordingly, the Iranian energy sector must focus its efforts on meeting this continuing demand. Today Iran ranks 19th largest producer and 20th largest consumer of electricity in the world. A research by the Ministry of Energy indicated that between 15,000-20,000 megawatts of capacity should be added in Iran in the next 20 years. In recent years Iran has put greater emphasis on participation of domestic and foreign investors in electricity generation sector, with projects underway to add 40,000 MWh more capacity to the national grid.\n\nIt is estimated that some 18.5 percent of electricity generated in Iran are wasted before it reaches consumers due to technical problems. Iran is among the top ten manufacturers of gas turbines with a capacity of 160 megawatts. Iranian experts of JEMCO (a subsidiary of IDRO) have succeeded in developing the capacity to produce one-megawatt generators. Iran has acquired self-sufficiency of over 80 percent in constructing hydraulic turbines and over 90 percent in producing gas turbines. Within the next few years, Iran can join the list of countries that produce power plant technology (2009). Iran has achieved the technical expertise to set up hydroelectric, gas and combined cycle power plants. Iran is not only self-sufficient in power plant construction but has also concluded a number of contracts on implementing projects in neighboring states.\n\nThe exploration efforts for sources of power generation are wide and diverse in Iran. Plans are being made to make oil efficient power plants as well as an emphasis on natural gas production in order to meet their growing electricity demand. Nuclear power and hydroelectric power are not focused on for the time being, but they are part of an overall strategy to meet electricity demands. The electricity sector is also heavily subsidized and mostly state owned companies control power distribution, transmission and generation. In order to meet the demands of the electricity sector, however, Iran is beginning to look into private investment. A by-law has been passed allowing the energy ministry to conclude rial or combined rial/foreign-currency contracts for the purchase of electricity from private companies. Private companies in Iran generated 14,440 megawatts of electricity in 2009.\n\nAlthough some criticize Iran's hydroelectric power plans as potentially dangerous to the environment, most agree that the country's current state of hydroelectric production is much better off than in the past. Iran has displayed a new approach to this sector. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the construction of hydroelectric power plants became both a popular private and public venture. Often, construction projects did not meet basic environmental standards, engineering standards, and technical requirements. As a result, many of these dams were destroyed or left in dilapidated conditions.\nBy 2004, the addition of new hydroelectric stations and the streamlining of conventional coal- and oil-fired stations increased installed capacity to 33,000 megawatts (MW). Of that amount, about 75 percent was based on natural gas, 18 percent on oil, and 7 percent on hydroelectric power. However, in 2004 Iran opened its first wind-powered and geothermal plants, and the first solar thermal plant was to come online in 2009. Iran has recoverable coal reserves of nearly 1.9bn short tonnes. The country produces about 1.3m short tonnes of coal annually and consumes about 1.5m short tonnes, making it a small net importer of coal.\n\nDemographic trends and intensified industrialization have caused electric power demand to grow by 8 percent per year. The government’s goal of 53,000 megawatts of installed capacity by 2010 is to be reached by bringing on line new gas-fired plants financed by independent power producers, including those with foreign investment backing, and by adding hydroelectric and nuclear power generating capacity. It has also been estimated that Iran has the potential to produce at least 6,150 MWh of electricity by Wave power from its coastline on Persian Gulf alone. Iran is also experimenting with electricity generation from organic wastes and plans to build power plants using sewage and organic waste of domestic and industrial origin as fuel. Another area in which there is ongoing research is assessment of Iran's tidal power potential. With about 300 clear sunny days a year and an average of 2,200 kilowatt-hour solar radiation per square meter, Iran has a great potential to tap solar energy.\n\nIran plans to generate 23,000 MWh of electricity through nuclear technology by 2025 to meet its increasing demand for energy. The first of four 915 MW reactors of Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, built with help from Russia, came online in August 2010 after numerous delays and Iran's indigenously designed Darkhovin Nuclear Power Plant is scheduled to come online in 2016. Overall, Iran remains a net exporter of electricity and exchanges electrical power with all its land neighbors. While nuclear power in the US costs a little over 10 cents per kilowatt hour, Iran, with domestic uranium enrichment capabilities, high interest rates, low energy output (a single 1,000-watt reactor), low efficiency, extremely slow reactor construction, and no reprocessing pays around 68 cents per kilowatt hour (this assumes a price of $140 per separative working unit and of $40 per kilogram of uranium).\n\nIn 2010, the Iranian government announced plans to build 2,000MW of renewable energy capacity between 2010-2015. As of 2010, Iran had 8,500MW of hydroelectric capacity and 130MW of wind energy capacity. As at 2010, private companies had signed contracts to build more than 600MW of biomass systems and 500MW of new wind energy projects. \n\nIran is also working to make renewable energy commercially viable and the Ministry of Energy is required to buy privately produced renewable energy at world market prices. A feed-in-tariff (FiT) for wind and biomass energy around 13 cents/kWh is helpful.\n\nIn 2012, Iran allocated €500 million from the National Development Fund for renewable energy projects. Also supporting the solar industry is the state-sponsored Renewable Energy Organization of Iran (SUNA), which is attached to the Energy Ministry and enjoys a budget of around $60 million.\n\nHydropower makes up 10,000 megawatts or 14% of Iran’s overall energy mix (2015). Iran is able to build its water turbines domestically.\n\nIn 2016, the Iranian Biofuel Society (IBS) in collaboration with the Vice Presidency for Science of Technology and Tehran and the Suburbs Bus Company executed the first urban pilot project for the consumption of waste cooking oil biodiesel in Tehran`s bus fleet in an attempt to generate public awareness regarding \"Global Climate Change\", wherein they recommend “reducing net anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere” and “minimizing anthropogenic disturbances of” atmospheric gasses by partial replacement of fossil fuels with waste-oriented biofuels. The program was also supported by Small Grant Programme, Global Environmental Facility, United Nation Development Program (SGP/GEF/UNDP) Office in Iran.\n\nIran's unique geographical position means 90% of the country has enough sun to generate solar power 300 days a year. According to PressTV Iran has 520 watts per hour per square meter of solar radiation every day. Other sources give an average of 2,200 kilowatt-hour solar radiation per square meter. Energy generated by solar power reached 53 MW in 2005 and 67 MW in 2011.\n\nIran has the potential to generate 20 to 30 GW of wind energy. That is half of the total energy consumption needs of the country. As at 2012 Iran had 163 wind turbines with an installed capacity of 92470 kWh. Sadid Industrial Group is a well known domestic manufacturer in this field. India's Sulzon Energy and Germany's Siemens are also potential providers of wind turbines to Iran.\n\nIran has the potential to become the 9th largest geothermal energy producer.\nAccording to global tectonics Iran is impacted by subduction of the Arabian Plate under the Central Iranian Plate and four thrust faults: two that make the Southern Caspian Sea Depression and two in the north of Iran, part of the Caucasian Range. Mt. Sabalan and Mt. Sahand are two Quaternary Volcanos in the area. Sabalan is a large stratovolcano consisting of 3 summits named Soltan (4811), Heram (4612m) and Kasra (4573m). The stratovolcano is situated on a possible horst trending northeast-southwest and erupted at latest in the Holocene. Caldera collapsing has caused a depression about 400 m in height and 12 km in diameter. The lava flows consists of trachyandesite, andesite and dacite and pyroclastic deposits. There are 9 hot springs with a temperature in the range of 25-85°C. \nhttps://www.geothermal-energy.org/pdf/IGAstandard/WGC/2005/0607.pdf\n\nSource: CIA factbook, unless stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"note:\" as of 2009, 1/3 of Iran's gasoline needs are imported because of insufficient domestic refining capacity, over-consumption and contraband.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Gradually, LCEC gradually established itself as an independent technical national center offering the Lebanese Government and more specifically the Ministry of Energy and Water all kinds of services dedicated to energy efficiency and renewable energy.\n\nThe role of the LCEC project was consolidated as an independent technical national center in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that signed between MEW and UNDP on 18 June 2007. GEF and UNDP extended their support to the LCEC in 2009 until the end of 2013.\n\nIn 2011, LCEC finally achieved to stand out as an independent organization affiliated to the Ministry of Energy and Water and is now financially and administratively independent. LCEC operates under the direct supervision of the Lebanese Minister of Energy and Water.\n\nIn 2013, the financial and administrative support of GEF and UNDP to LCEC came to an end. During that same year, LCEC received its first financial support from the Lebanese Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW). The MEW support ensured the sustainability of the center for a minimum of 5 years. LCEC also benefits from the support of the European Union (EU) through a contract signed with the Central Bank of Lebanon (BDL).\n\nLCEC has established itself as a technical point of reference specialized in energy conservation issues within the Lebanese Ministry of Energy and Water. LCEC targets fundamental energy issues.\n\nLCEC works on setting national strategies and action plans to be adopted by the Lebanese Government. LCEC also works on the implementation and the quality control of national projects and initiatives in the country. Moreover, LCEC is involved in the update and development of the legal and administrative framework needed for the greening of the energy sector. Until date, LCEC has implemented numerous energy efficiency and renewable energy projects and initiatives that have resulted in many positive changes within the Lebanese society and economy.\n\nThe main driver of the LCEC is the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) that summarizes the national efforts in energy efficiency and renewable energy. At the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Summit, Lebanon voluntarily pledged to increase the renewable energy share to 12% by 2020. This voluntary commitment was anchored within the “Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector” prepared by the Ministry of Energy and Water and officially adopted by the Council of Ministers in June 2010. The policy paper includes ten strategic initiatives for the improvement of infrastructure, supply and demand systems and the definition of legal framework. Two key initiatives target respectively the renewable energy and the demand side management/ energy efficiency.\n\nFollowing this, LCEC developed the NEEAP Lebanon 2011-2015 which was adopted in August 2010 by the Ministry of Energy and Water and approved in November 2011 by the Lebanese Government. NEEAP summarizes all national objectives, programmes and policies in 14 independent but correlated initiatives in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors. NEEAP was prepared in conformance with the Arab EE guideline (based on the EU directive 2006/32/EC on energy end-use efficiency and energy service) and Lebanon was the first Arab country to officially adopt such plan. LCEC is currently updating the NEEAP while preparing the Renewable Energy Strategy for Lebanon that will include several scenarios in achieving the set target of 12% RE by 2020 and that will also be in accordance with the Arab renewable energy guideline under preparation.\n\nMoreover, LCEC provides both the public and private sector with expert advice, finance and accreditation, develops energy efficiency standards and labels, and provides national energy database indicators.\n\nThe work of LCEC is characterized by various partnerships with national and international private and public entities.\n\nthe Ministry of Energy and Water is the central public organization in charge of the energy sector in Lebanon. LCEC is affiliated to the Ministry of Energy and Water in all major decisions, initiatives and projects related to energy efficiency and renewable energy.\n\nLCEC is also the technical partner of the Central Bank of Lebanon (BDL) in the review and evaluation of all technical applications to low-interest energy loans submitted to BDL.\n\nAt the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Summit, Lebanon voluntarily pledged to increase the renewable energy shares to 12% by 2020. This voluntary commitment was anchored within the “Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector” prepared by the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) and officially adopted by the Council of Ministers in June 2010: it includes ten strategic initiatives for the improvement of infrastructure, supply and demand systems and the definition of legal framework. Two key initiatives target respectively the Renewable Energy and the Demand Side Management / Energy Efficiency.\n\nFollowing the “Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector” prepared by the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) and officially adopted by the Council of Ministers in June 2010, LCEC developed the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2011-2015 for Lebanon (NEEAP) to achieve the national target of 12% renewable energy share by 2020. NEEAP summarizes all national objectives, programmes and policies in 14 initiatives in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors.\nThe initiatives of the NEEAP are the following:\n\nLCEC is currently updating and developing the NEEAP 2015-2020 while preparing the Renewable Energy Strategy (RES) and the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) for Lebanon. The Lebanese NEEAP was prepared in conformance with the Arab EE guideline (based on the EU directive 2006/32/EC on energy end-use efficiency and energy service) and Lebanon was the first Arab country to officially adopt such plan.\n\nThe activities of the Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC) expand to the implementation of pilot projects in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector. Through grants, donations, and partnerships, LCEC was successful in implementing different pilot projects and is currently working on the implementation of many others. Pilot projects help initiate a new momentum in the market, and most importantly offer an opportunity to benefit from the lessons learnt.\n\nThe Chinese government donated 500 solar water heaters to be installed in the liberated areas in South Lebanon. The Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC) was assigned by the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) to support its installation both technically and financially. The workload consisted of handling all project logistics, hosting Chinese experts to conduct an intensive training workshop, assisting in the selection of beneficiaries.\n\nIn addition to the above, a sum of 112,500 USD was raised to cater for the installation of the units.\n\nUnfortunately and as a result of the July war in Lebanon, 200 solar units were destroyed. In this regards, and after the impressive success of the project, LCEC has followed up with the Chinese Embassy to provide Lebanon with similar donation due to its direct results on the beneficiaries. This could be achieved and will be offered under the second phase of the project.\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations Development Program, through its Energy and Environment Programme, with the funding of the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), has launched a pilot project to install solar water heaters at public / NGO facilities in selected damaged areas of Beirut, Bekaa & South Lebanon due to July 2006 war.\nUnder the supervision of the Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC), the project consisted of installing 93 individual (natural circulation) solar water heaters, and 11 collective (forced circulation) solar water heaters, covering a total of 1,040 square meters of collection area.\nThe solar water heating units were executed by three qualified firms through an international bid, and divided into 5 lots.\n\n\n\n\nBased on a collaboration agreement signed between LCEC and Electricité de Zahlé (EDZ), EDZ installed around 1,048 Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) in the village of Niha in the Bekaa area, completely free-of-charge. The 1,048 CFLs were purchased by LCEC and the installation was offered free-of-charge by EDZ as an in-kind contribution.\n\nThe direct objective of the pilot project is to reduce the energy bill of the different consumers and therefore remove part of the financial burden on families in this area. Another major objective is the reduction of GHG emissions generated by inefficient lighting. In addition, setting this project as a success story supported by real achieved savings can increase the market share of energy efficient lighting in Lebanon and consequently boost the market toward the phase out of incandescent bulbs in the country. This strategy goes with the different strategies followed by many countries in Europe, America, and Australia. Finally, the project shall achieve a percentage of dollars savings in the national energy bill.\n\nThere are two very important reasons for which the project has chosen EDZ for this installation. EDZ is a professional electrical utility that has online control on the electricity consumption in each and every house. This means that EDZ is able to track the changes in the energy bills resulting from the project implementation and can therefore report on the measurement and savings in kWh and in dollars. The second reason is that the management at EDZ is ready to support this program financially at a later stage.\n\nFollowing a site survey done by EDZ, LCEC supplied around 1,048 CFL's of different sizes to EDZ with a total cost not exceeding 2,500 USD.\n\nDue to the importance of this pilot project, the event was covered by the media in every aspect. In fact, a press release was distributed to the main newspapers in town, namely Annahar, Assafir, Al Anwar, and Al Mustaqbal. In addition, the project was covered by two main television stations in Lebanon, namely LBCI and NTV.\n\nRecently, LCEC in collaboration with EDZ has worked on developing a complete study report on the success of this project, one year after its completion. The results of the study will be published soon by LCEC.\n\nThese pilot projects are preparing the ground towards implanting a clear DSM strategy developing currently. The strategy shall target the installation of a massive number of CFL fixtures all over Lebanon.\n\nAfter the success of the 500 solar water heaters donated by the People’s Republic of China and subsequent to the Israeli’s attacks in July 2006 leading to the destruction of 200 of units earlier that year, the LCEC and the Ministry of Energy & Water (MEW) have been closely coordinating with the Chinese government to proceed with a phase 2 grant that will include 600 solar water heaters of similar capacity and type of phase 1 (208 L tank capacity and 28 glass tubes).\n\n\n\nThe “Beirut River Solar Snake” (BRSS) is the 1st pilot project in Lebanon to produce electricity from solar energy. It was launched by the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) in 2013 and is under the supervision and management of LCEC. The project will be extended over a distance of 6.5 Km on the top of the Beirut River and have 10 MW installed capacity to be the first grid connected solar farm that seeks to generate and supply EDL with clean energy. The project will also have a technical building. The implementation of the first phase has an installed capacity of 1 MW extending over an area of 16,000 m2. The cost of the 1st phase of the project is 3.1 Million USD (with a budget of 4 million USD) and is completely financed by MEW. The execution of the first phase started in July 2014 is now completed.\n\nLCEC was engaged in the public street lighting project and managed the installation of 500 solar street lights at the end of December 2014 through a grant by the Chinese Government in the Dora, Jounieh, Cornet Chehwan and Batroun areas.\n\nThe “Educational and Demonstration Platform for Renewable Energies in Lebanon\" project is a joint initiative between the French company Transénergie and the Ministry of Energy and Water represented by LCEC with the direct support of the Industrial Research Institute (IRI) and UNDP Lebanon. It aims at the installation of an educational platform to be used by researchers, educational institutions, university students, as well as professionals in the solar photovoltaic sector.\n\nA main component of LCEC’s work is the GEF-funded project “Global Solar Water Heating Market Transformation and Strengthening Initiative” aiming at the installation of around 190,000 square meters of solar water heaters (SWHs) during the timeline of the project from 2010 till the end of 2014. Another aim of the project is to help the market reach a total annual sale of 50,000 m2 and the installation of 1,050,000 square meters of SWHs capacity by 2020. To achieve these goals, the project worked on pilot installation of solar water heating, on training engineers and technicians, advertisement and marketing, and all other aspects that affect the solar water heating market growth.\n\nTill july 2014, a total of 5,878 installations were approved for SWH loans, and 49.63% of which benefited from the USD 200 subsidy. In total, 33,239 systems sold between 2012 and 2013.\nMoreover, LCEC provides both the public and private sector with expert advice, finance and accreditation, develops energy efficiency standards and labels, and provides national energy database indicators.\n\nSince 2001, a nationwide program on energy audits for medium and large consuming facilities was initiated. This was a project financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), managed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and called “Lebanon Cross Sectoral Energy Efficiency and Removal of Barriers to ESCO Operation”. The initial period 2002-2004 saw delays in project implementation; consequently, the project was essentially restarted with a new project team in 2005 and was operational until the end of 2009.\nThe project was mainly targeting the high combined consumption of energy in industrial plants and buildings, where the potential for energy savings is important and promising. In 2006, LCEC aimed and worked on creating a market for ESCOs (Energy Service Companies that offer energy efficiency improvement services) where the end user can request a specialized ESCO to conduct an energy audit.\n\nOver 125 audits were completed within the project, mostly for large facilities.\nOnly one ESCO was operational at the beginning of the programme. In 2010 only 8 ESCOs where active, nowadays more than 30 are available and the market is still expanding rapidly. \nTo further support the growth of the ESCOs market, LCEC launched an initiative in NEAAP called “Paving the Way for Energy Audit and ESCO Business”. The purpose of this initiative is to support the development of the ESCO working in the energy audit business and provide them with the suitable financial, fiscal and technical incentives to remove all the obstacles hindering their growth. To support this initiative, LCEC has offered periodical trainings, workshops and seminars on energy audit activities and procedures to technician, engineers, bankers and to all those involved in the field.\nThe ESCO pre-qualification programme was launched by LCEC by 2014 in order to regulate the market and have a recommended list of companies for potential projects.\n\nThe National Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Action (NEEREA) is a green financing mechanism that allows private sector entities to apply to subsidized loans for any type of EE and/or RE projects.\nThe loan has a ceiling of 20 million USD and is offered at an interest rate of 0.6% for 14 years. The greens loans are provided through any of the Lebanese commercial banks to directly reach the end user. The European Union is contributing to NEEREA by offering a grant over a share of the investment cost of maximum 5 million USD, 15% for nonsubsidized sectors and 5% for subsidized sectors.\n\nBy January 2015, more than 200 projects were approved under the NEEREA financing mechanism with a total amount of more than 200 Million USD. Results show that around 60% of the projects were for solar photovoltaic while 82% of loans amount were for green buildings.\n\n"}

The word \"fruit\" is used in several different ways. The definition of fruit for these lists is a culinary fruit, i.e. \"Any sweet, edible part of a plant that resembles fruit, even if it does not develop from a floral ovary; also used in a technically imprecise sense for some sweet or sweetish vegetables, some of which may resemble a true fruit or are used in cookery as if they were a fruit, for example rhubarb.\"\nMany edible plant parts that are \"true fruits\" botanically speaking, are not considered culinary fruits. They are classified as vegetables in the culinary sense (for example: the tomato, zucchini, and so on), and hence they do not appear in this list. Similarly, some botanical fruits are classified as nuts (e.g. Brazil nut and various almonds), or staples (e.g. breadfruit), and likewise do not appear here. There also exist many fruits which are edible and palatable but for various reasons have not become popular.\n\n\nFruits of temperate climates are almost always borne on trees or woody shrubs or lianas. They will not grow adequately in the tropics, as they need a period of cold (a chilling requirement) each year before they will flower. The apple, pear, cherry, and plum are the most widely grown and eaten, owing to their adaptability. Many other fruits are important regionally but do not figure prominently in commerce. Many sorts of small fruit on this list are gathered from the wild, just as they were in Neolithic times.\n\nIn non-technical usage, berry means any small fruit that can be eaten whole and lacks objectionable seeds. The bramble fruits, compound fruits of genus \"Rubus\" (blackberries), are some of the most popular of these that are not true berries:\n\nThe true berries are dominated by the family Ericaceae, many of which are hardy in the subarctic:\n\nFruits in this category are not hardy to extreme cold, as the preceding temperate fruits are, yet tolerate some frost and may have a modest chilling requirement. Notable among these are natives of the Mediterranean:\n\nIn the important genus \"Citrus\" (Rutaceae), some members are tropical, tolerating no frost. All common species of commerce are somewhat hardy:\n\n\nTropical fruits grow on plants of all habitats. The only characteristic that they share is an intolerance of frost.\n\n\nFruits native to Africa or of African origin:\nFruits native to Asia or of Asian origin:\nFruits native to Latin America or of Latin American origin. Plants\nare of South American origin, except as noted.\nCanada and the United States are home to a surprising number of edible plants, especially berries; however, only three are commercially grown/known on a global scale (grapes, cranberries, and blueberries.) Many of the fruits below are still eaten locally as they have been for centuries and others are generating renewed interest by eco-friendly gardeners (less need for bug control) and chefs of the region alike.\nFruits native to Oceania or of Oceanian origin:\n\nThe family Rosaceae dominates the temperate fruits, both in numbers and in importance. The pome fruits, stone fruits and brambles are fruits of plants in Rosaceae.\n\nThe pome fruits:\n\nThe stone fruits, drupes of genus \"Prunus\":\nIn non-technical usage, berry means any small fruit that can be eaten whole and lacks objectionable seeds. The bramble fruits, compound fruits of genus \"Rubus\" (blackberries), are some of the most popular of these that are not true berries:\nThe true berries are dominated by the family Ericaceae, many of which are hardy in the subarctic:\nOther berries not in Rosaceae or Ericaceae:\n\nSeveral cacti yield edible fruits, which are important traditional foods for some Native American peoples:\nOnly Angiosperms have fruit, a structure that surrounds the seed. Gymnosperms have naked seeds, but some of them have reproductive structures that resemble fruit.\n\nPodocarps are conifers in the family Podocarpaceae, The seed cones are highly modified and, in some, the seed is surrounded by fleshy scale tissue, resembling a drupe. These berry-like cone scales are eaten by birds which then disperse the seeds in their droppings and the cones can be eaten in many species. Podocarps are either half-hardy or frost tender, depending on species. Many genera are similar in that they have edible \"fruits\" and often don't have a common name.\n\nMost gourds and many melons are regarded as culinary vegetables. The\nfollowing are generally regarded as fruits:\n\nThe accessory fruits, seed organs which are not botanically berries at all:\n\n"}

{"id": "20587582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20587582", "title": "Live-line working", "text": "Live-line working\n\nIn electrical engineering, live-line working, also known as hotline maintenance, is the maintenance of electrical equipment, often operating at high voltage, while the equipment is energised. The first techniques for live-line working were developed in the early years of the 20th century, and both equipment and work methods were later refined to deal with increasingly higher voltages. In the 1960s, methods were developed in the laboratory to enable field workers to come into direct contact with high voltage lines. Such methods can be applied to enable safe work at the highest transmission voltages.\n\nElectricity is hazardous: an electric shock from a current as low as 35 milliamps is sufficient to cause fibrillation of the heart in vulnerable individuals. Even a healthy individual is at risk of falling from a high structure due to loss of muscle control. Higher currents can cause respiratory failure and result in extensive and life-threatening burns. The first recorded human fatality occurred in 1879 when a stage carpenter in Lyon, France touched a 250 volt wire. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is energised, even at high voltages, makes electricity a particular hazard.\n\nAt high voltages, it is unnecessary to come into direct contact with charged equipment to be shocked. An electric field surrounds all charged devices. Bringing a conducting object such as a human body into that field can intensify the field enough for electrical breakdown of the air and an arc to jump from the equipment to earth via that person. In the U.S., the Occupational Safety and Health Administration establishes clearance guidelines. Solid materials such as rubber, while excellent insulators at low voltages, are also subject to electrical failure if subjected to a high enough field.\n\nElectricity utilities wish to avoid loss of supply, for which they receive customer complaints or are financially penalised. At the same time they are obligated to maintain and replace their electrical equipment on a regular basis. Due to the hazard of high voltage, it is normally necessary for equipment to be isolated from the supply before being worked upon, termed a \"planned outage\".\n\nIn a radially-supplied system, a planned outage results in a loss of supply, unless equipment is connected in parallel, back up supplies are available or the grid is reswitched to transfer the electrical load elsewhere. An interconnected grid results in no loss of power, but security of supply is compromised, and out-of-merit generation may need to be ordered to maintain system security, which can be expensive.\n\nIn general, there are three methods of live-line working which help workers avoid the considerable hazards of live line working. In various ways, they all serve to prevent current flowing from the live equipment through the worker.\n\nHot sticks are used in live line work by having the worker remain at a specified distance from the live parts and carry out the work by means of an insulating stick. Tools can be attached to the stick, allowing work to be performed with the worker himself safely away from the live conductors.\n\nA live line worker is electrically protected by insulating gloves and other insulating equipment, and carries out the work in direct mechanical contact with live parts.\n\nThe barehanded approach has a live line worker performing the work in direct electric contact with live parts. Before contact, the worker's body is raised to the same electric potential as the live parts, and then held there by electric connection, while maintaining suitable isolation from the surroundings which are at different potentials, like the ground, other people or trees. Because the worker and the work are at the same potential, no current flows through the worker.\n\nSome organizations additionally consider working on unearthed de-energised equipment to be another form of live-line working. This is because the line might become inadvertently charged (e.g. through a back-charged transformer, possibly as a result of an improperly connected, inadequately isolated emergency generator at a customer facility), or inductively coupled from an adjacent in-service line. To prevent this, the line is first grounded via a clamp known as a bond or drain earth. Once this is in place, further work is not considered to be live-line working.\n\nHot-stick working appeared in the second decade of the 20th century, when insulating poles made from baked wood were used for tasks such as replacing fuses, replacing post insulators, and transferring lines onto temporary supports. The sticks enabled the linemen to carry out the work without infringing on the minimum clearance distances from live equipment. As experience with the techniques developed, then the operating voltages at which the work was performed increased. With the advent of fibreglass poles in the late 1950s, which neither split nor soaked up rainwater, utilities were prepared to carry out hot-stick working to their highest operating voltages, perhaps 765 kV.\n\nTools, such as hooks or socket wrenches can be mounted at the end of the pole. More sophisticated poles can accept pneumatically or hydraulically driven power tools which allow, for example, bolts to be unscrewed remotely. A rotary wire brush allows a terminal to be scoured clean before a connection is made. However, a worker's dexterity is naturally reduced when operating tools at the end of a pole that is several metres long.\n\nUsually applied for work above 1 kV AC 1.5 kV DC\nThe primary classes are:\nClass 1 - phase to phase working voltage 7.5 kV\nClass 2 - phase to phase working voltage 17 kV\nClass 3 - phase to phase working voltage 26.5 kV\nClass 4 - phase to phase working voltage 36 kV\n\nGloves protect the worker from exposure to the live part being worked upon sometimes referred to as the 1st point of contact; the point where current would enter the body should an inadvertent contact be made.\nCovers of insulating material such as blankets and linehose are employed in rubber glove working to protect the worker from exposure to a part at a different potential sometimes referred to as the 2nd point of contact; the point where current would leave the body should an inadvertent contact be made.\n\nBare-hand, or potential working involves placing the worker in direct electrical contact with an energized overhead line. The worker might work alongside the lines, from a platform that is suspended from them, or may sit or stand directly on the line itself. In all cases, the worker's body is maintained at the same voltage as the line. It is imperative that the worker maintain appropriate and adequate limits of approach to any part at a different potential.\n\nThe first procedures for barehand working were developed in 1960 by Harold L. Rorden, a high-voltage engineer for American Electric Power. Techniques were further refined following field and laboratory tests.\n\nThere are a number of ways in which the worker can access the live parts:\n\n\nAs the lineman approaches the wire, an arc will form between them as the worker is charged. This arc can be debilitating, and the worker must immediately bond himself electrically to the line to prevent further arcing. A worker may use a conducting wand during the approach to first make the connection. Once on the line, the worker is safe from shock as both the lineman and the wire are at the same electric potential, and no current passes through his body. This is the same principle that allows birds to safely alight on power lines.\n\nWhen the work is completed, the process is reversed to remove the worker safely from the wire. Barehand working provides the lineman with greater dexterity than the hot stick method, and may be the preferred option if conditions permit it. With this technique, insulator strings, conductor spacers and vibration dampers can be replaced, or lines spliced, without any loss of supply.\n\nThe strong electric field surrounding charged equipment is enough to drive a current of approximately 15 μA for each kV·m through a human body. To prevent this, hot-hand workers are usually required to wear a Faraday suit. This is a set of overalls made from or woven throughout with conducting fibers. The suit is in effect a wearable Faraday cage, which equalizes the potential over the body, and ensures there is no through-tissue current. Conducting gloves, even conducting socks, are also necessary, leaving only the face uncovered.\n\nThere is little practical upper voltage limit for hot-hand working, and it has been successfully performed at some of the highest transmission operating voltages in the world, such as the Russian 1150 kV system.\n\nA lineman wearing a Faraday suit can work on live, high-power lines by being transported to the lines in a helicopter. Wearing the suit, they can crawl down the wires.\n\nCalculation of minimum approach distances take account of switching surges and other transients. Transmission systems are often fitted with coordinated protection devices called autoreclosers, which are circuit breakers that automatically attempt to remake a circuit after a fault. In the event that a fault did occur it would be most undesirable for the autorecloser to re-energise the circuit because the limits of approach would be greatly reduced and the workers' position could be compromised. Hence, auto-reclosing equipment is rendered inoperative while live working takes place. Additional protection against unplanned overvoltage events (such as switching surges) can be provided by means of a surge diverter known as portable protective air gap.\n\nAn electric arc is extremely bright, including in the ultraviolet, and can cause arc eye, a painful and potentially blinding condition. Workers may be provided with appropriately tinted goggles that protect their vision in the event of a flash, and provide defence against debris ejected by an arc.\n\nGovernment regulations may regulate conditions for live working conditions. For example, in United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration may require that more than one worker be present on site when working on live equipment above a specified voltage. The work may be postponed if adverse weather conditions such as lightning or rainfall are anticipated.\n\n"}

It is the goal of a project at Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works. It is a high-beta fusion reactor.\n\nThe high-beta configuration allows a compact fusion reactor (CFR) design and expedited development. \n\n\"High beta\" implies that the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure is greater than or equal to 1. By contrast tokamak designs reach only 0.05.\n\nThe CFR chief designer and technical team lead is Thomas McGuire. McGuire studied fusion as a source of space propulsion in response to a NASA desire to improve travel times to Mars.\n\nThe project began in 2010, and was publicly presented at the Google Solve for X forum on February 7, 2013.\n\nIn October 2014 Lockheed Martin announced a plan to \"build and test a compact fusion reactor in less than a year with a prototype to follow within five years\". \n\nIn May 2016, Rob Weiss announced that Lockheed Martin continued to support the project and would increase its investment in it.\n\nCFR plans to achieve high beta (the ratio of plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure) by combining cusp confinement and magnetic mirrors to confine the plasma. Cusps are sharply bent magnetic fields. Ideally, the plasma forms a sheath along the surface of the cusps and plasma leaks out along the axis and edges of the sharply bent field. The plasma lost along the edges recycles back into the cusps.\n\nCFR uses two mirror sets. A pair of ring mirrors is placed inside the cylindrical reactor vessel at either end. The other mirror set encircles the reactor cylinder. The ring magnets produce a type of magnetic field known as a diamagnetic cusp, in which magnetic forces rapidly change direction and push the nuclei towards the midpoint between the two rings. The fields from the external magnets push the nuclei back towards the vessel ends.\n\nMagnetic field strength is an increasing function of distance from the center. This implies that as the plasma pressure causes the plasma to expand, the magnetic field becomes stronger at the plasma edge, increasing containment.\n\nCFR employs superconducting magnets. These allow strong magnetic fields to be created with less energy than conventional magnets. The CFR has no net current, which Lockheed claimed eliminates the prime source of plasma instabilities. The plasma has a favorable surface-to-volume ratio, which improves confinement. The plasma's small volume reduces the energy needed to achieve fusion.\n\nThe project plans to replace the microwave emitters that heat the plasma in their prototypes with neutral beam injection, in which electrically neutral deuterium atoms transfer their energy to the plasma. Once initiated, the energy from fusion maintains the necessary temperature for subsequent fusion events.\n\nThe eventual device may reach in width. The company claims that each design iteration is shorter and far lower cost than large-scale projects such as the Joint European Torus, ITER or NIF.\n\nA P reactor, long by in diameter, produces about a reactor, similar in size to an A5W nuclear submarine fission reactor.\n\nRing magnets require protection from the plasma's neutron radiation. Plasma temperatures must reach many millions of kelvins. Superconducting magnets must be kept just above absolute zero to maintain superconductivity.\n\nThe \"blanket\" component that lines the reactor vessel has two functions: it captures the neutrons and transfers their energy to a coolant, and forces the neutrons to collide with lithium atoms, transforming them into tritium to fuel the reactor. The blanket must be an estimated 80–150 cm thick and weigh 300–1000 tons.\n\nThe prototype was planned to be a 100-megawatt deuterium and tritium reactor measuring that could fit on the back of a large truck and would be about one tenth the size of current reactor prototypes. 100 megawatts is enough to provide power for 80,000 people. A series of prototypes were constructed to approach this goal.\n\nTechnical results presented on the T4 experiment in 2015 showed a cold, partially ionized plasma with the following parameters: peak electron temperature of 20 Electron volts, electron density, less than 1% ionization fraction and of input power. No confinement or fusion reaction rates were presented.\n\nMcGuire presented two theoretical reactor concepts in 2015. One was an ideal configuration weighing 200 metric tons with 1 meter of cryogenic radiation shielding and 15 tesla magnets. The other was a conservative configuration weighing 2,000 metric tons, with 2 meters of cryogenic radiation shielding and 5 Tesla magnets.\n\nThe T4B prototype was announced in 2016.\n\nParameters:\n\nParameters:\nIn February 2018, Lockheed Martin was granted one patent. It applied for three others.\n\nPhysics professor and director of the UK's national Fusion laboratory Steven Cowley called for more data, pointing out that the current thinking in fusion research is that \"bigger is better\". Other fusion reactors achieve 8 times improvement in heat confinement when machine size is doubled.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "144147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144147", "title": "Miscarriage", "text": "Miscarriage\n\nMiscarriage, also known as spontaneous abortion and pregnancy loss, is the natural death of an embryo or fetus before it is able to survive independently. Some use the cutoff of 20 weeks of gestation, after which fetal death is known as a stillbirth. The most common symptom of a miscarriage is vaginal bleeding with or without pain. Sadness, anxiety and guilt often occur afterwards. Tissue and clot-like material may leave the uterus and pass through and out of the vagina. When a woman keeps having miscarriages, infertility is present.\nRisk factors for miscarriage include an older parent, previous miscarriage, exposure to tobacco smoke, obesity, diabetes, thyroid problems, and drug or alcohol use. About 80% of miscarriages occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (the first trimester). The underlying cause in about half of cases involves chromosomal abnormalities. Diagnosis of a miscarriage may involve checking to see if the cervix is open or closed, testing blood levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and an ultrasound. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include an ectopic pregnancy and implantation bleeding.\nPrevention is occasionally possible with good prenatal care. Avoiding drugs, alcohol, infectious diseases, and radiation may decrease the risk of miscarriage. No specific treatment is usually needed during the first 7 to 14 days. Most miscarriages will complete without additional interventions. Occasionally the medication misoprostol or a procedure such as vacuum aspiration is used to remove the remaining tissue. Women who have a blood type of rhesus negative (Rh negative) may require Rho(D) immune globulin. Pain medication may be beneficial. Emotional support may help with negative emotions.\nMiscarriage is the most common complication of early pregnancy. Among women who know they are pregnant, the miscarriage rate is roughly 10% to 20%, while rates among all fertilisation is around 30% to 50%. In those under the age of 35 the risk is about 10% while it is about 45% in those over the age of 40. Risk begins to increase around the age of 30. About 5% of women have two miscarriages in a row. Some recommend not using the term \"abortion\" in discussions with those experiencing a miscarriage in an effort to decrease distress.\nSigns of a miscarriage include vaginal spotting, abdominal pain, cramping, and fluid, blood clots, and tissue passing from the vagina. Bleeding can be a symptom of miscarriage, but many women also have bleeding in early pregnancy and don't miscarry. Bleeding during pregnancy may be referred to as a threatened miscarriage. Of those who seek clinical treatment for bleeding during pregnancy, about half will miscarry. Miscarriage may be detected during an ultrasound exam, or through serial human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) testing.\n\nMiscarriage may occur for many reasons, not all of which can be identified. Risk factors are those things that increase the likelihood of having a miscarriage but don't necessarily cause a miscarriage. Up to 70 conditions, infections, medical procedures, lifestyle factors, occupational exposures, chemical exposure, and shift work are associated with increased risk for miscarriage. Some of these risks include endocrine, genetic, uterine, or hormonal abnormalities, reproductive tract infections, and tissue rejection caused by an autoimmune disorder.\n\nMost clinically apparent miscarriages (two-thirds to three-quarters in various studies) occur during the first trimester. About 30% to 40% of all fertilized eggs miscarry, often before the pregnancy is known. The embryo typically dies before the pregnancy is expelled; bleeding into the decidua basalis and tissue necrosis causes uterine contractions to expel the pregnancy. Early miscarriages can be due to a developmental abnormality of the placenta or other embryonic tissues. In some instances an embryo does not form but other tissues do. This has been called a \"blighted ovum\".\n\nSuccessful implantation of the zygote into the uterus is most likely 8 to 10 days after conception. If the zygote has not implanted by day 10, implantation becomes increasingly unlikely in subsequent days.\n\nA chemical pregnancy is a pregnancy that was detected by testing but ends in miscarriage before or around the time of the next expected period.\n\nChromosomal abnormalities are found in more than half of embryos miscarried in the first 13 weeks. Half of embryonic miscarriages (25% of all miscarriages) have an aneuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes). Common chromosome abnormalities found in miscarriages include autosomal trisomy (22-32%), monosomy X (5-20%), triploidy (6-8%), tetraploidy (2-4%), or other structural chromosomal abnormalities (2%). Genetic problems are more likely to occur with older parents; this may account for the higher rates observed in older women.\n\nThere is no evidence that progesterone given in the first trimester reduces the risk of miscarriage, and luteal phase progesterone deficiency may or may not be a contributing factor to miscarriage.\n\nSecond trimester losses may be due to maternal factors such as uterine malformation, growths in the uterus (fibroids), or cervical problems. These conditions also may contribute to premature birth. Unlike first-trimester miscarriages, second-trimester miscarriages are less likely to be caused by a genetic abnormality; chromosomal aberrations are found in a third of cases. Infection during the third trimester can cause a miscarriage.\n\nThe age of the pregnant woman is a significant risk factor. Miscarriage rates increase steadily with age, with more substantial increases after age 35. In those under the age of 35 the risk is about 10% while it is about 45% in those over the age of 40. Risk begins to increase around the age of 30. Paternal age is associated with increased risk.\n\nNot only is obesity associated with miscarriage, it can result in sub-fertility and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recurrent miscarriage is also related to obesity. Women with bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa may have a greater risk for miscarriage. Nutrient deficiencies have not been found to impact miscarriage rates but hyperemesis gravidarum sometimes precedes a miscarriage.\nCaffeine consumption also has been correlated to miscarriage rates, at least at higher levels of intake. However, such higher rates have been found to be statistically significant only in certain circumstances.\n\nVitamin supplementation has generally not shown to be effective in preventing miscarriage. Chinese traditional medicine has not been found to prevent miscarriage.\n\nDisorders of the thyroid may affect pregnancy outcomes. Related to this, iodine deficiency is strongly associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. The risk of miscarriage is increased in those with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Women with well-controlled diabetes have the same risk of miscarriage as those without diabetes.\n\nIngesting food that has been contaminated with listeriosis, toxoplasmosis, and salmonella is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.\n\nAmniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are procedures conducted to assess the fetus. A sample of amniotic fluid is obtained by the insertion of a needle through the abdomen and into the uterus. Chorionic villus sampling is a similar procedure with a sample of tissue removed rather than fluid. These procedures are not associated with pregnancy loss during the second trimester but they are associated with miscarriages and birth defects in the first trimester. Miscarriage caused by invasive prenatal diagnosis (chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis) is rare (about 1%).\n\nThe effects of surgery on pregnancy are not well-known including the effects of bariatric surgery. Abdominal and pelvic surgery are not risk factors in miscarriage. Ovarian tumors and cysts that are removed have not been found to increase the risk of miscarriage. The exception to this is the removal of the corpus luteum from the ovary. This can cause fluctuations in the hormones necessary to maintain the pregnancy.\n\nImmunizations have not been found to cause miscarriage. There is no significant association between antidepressant medication exposure and spontaneous abortion. The risk of miscarriage is not likely decreased by discontinuing SSRI prior to pregnancy. Some available data suggest that there is a small increased risk of miscarriage for women taking any antidepressant, though this risk becomes less statistically significant when excluding studies of poor quality.\n\nMedicines that increase the risk of miscarriage include:\n\n\nIonizing radiation levels given to a woman during cancer treatment cause miscarriage. Exposure can also impact fertility. The use of chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat childhood cancer increases the risk of miscarriage.\n\nSeveral intercurrent diseases in pregnancy can potentially increase the risk of miscarriage, including diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hypothyroidism, certain infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases. PCOS may increase the risk of miscarriage. Two studies suggested treatment with the drug metformin significantly lowers the rate of miscarriage in women with PCOS, but the quality of these studies has been questioned. Metformin treatment in pregnancy has not been shown to be safe. In 2007 the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists also recommended against use of the drug to prevent miscarriage. Thrombophilias or defects in coagulation and bleeding were once thought to be a risk in miscarriage but have been subsequently questioned.\nSevere cases of hypothyroidism increase the risk of miscarriage. The effect of milder cases of hypothyroidism on miscarriage rates has not been established. A condition called luteal phase defect (LPD) is a failure of the uterine lining to be fully prepared for pregnancy. This can keep a fertilized egg from implanting or result in miscarriage.\n\n\"Mycoplasma genitalium\" infection is associated with increased risk of preterm birth and miscarriage.\n\nInfections can increase the risk of a miscarriage: rubella (German measles), cytomegalovirus, bacterial vaginosis, HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and malaria.\n\nAutoimmunity is possible cause of recurrent or late-term miscarriages. In the case of an autoimmune-induced miscarriages the woman's body attacks the growing fetus or prevents normal pregnancy progression. Autoimmune disease may cause genetic abnormalities in embryos which in turn may lead to miscarriage. As an example, Celiac disease increases the risk of miscarriage by an odds ratio of approximately 1.4. A disruption in normal immune function can lead to the formation of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. This will effect the ability to continue the pregnancy and if a woman has repeated miscarriages, she can be tested for it. Approximately 15% of recurrent miscarriages are related to immunologic factors. The presence of anti-thyroid autoantibodies is associated with an increased risk with an odds ratio of 3.73 and 95% confidence interval 1.8–7.6. Having Lupus also increases the risk for miscarriage.\n\nFifteen percent of women who have experienced three or more recurring miscarriages have some anatomical defect that prevents the pregnancy from being carried for the entire term. The structure of the uterus has an effect on the ability to carry a child to term. Anatomical differences are common and can be congenital. \nIn some women, cervical incompetence or cervical insufficiency occurs with the inability of the cervix to stay closed during the entire pregnancy. It does not cause first trimester miscarriages. In the second trimester it is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. It is identified after a premature birth has occurred at about 16–18 weeks into the pregnancy. During the second trimester, major trauma can result in a miscarriage.\n\nTobacco (cigarette) smokers have an increased risk of miscarriage. There is an increased risk regardless of which parent smokes, though the risk is higher when the gestational mother smokes.\n\nNausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP, or morning sickness) are associated with a decreased risk. Several possible causes have been suggested for morning sickness but there is still no agreement. NVP may represent a defense mechanism which discourages the mother's ingestion of foods that are harmful to the fetus; according to this model, a lower frequency of miscarriage would be an expected consequence of the different food choices made by women experiencing NVP.\n\nChemical and occupational exposures may have some effect in pregnancy outcomes. A cause and effect relationship almost can never be established. Those chemicals that are implicated in increasing the risk for miscarriage are DDT, lead, formaldehyde, arsenic, benzene and ethylene oxide. Video display terminals and ultrasound have not been found to have an effect on the rates of miscarriage. In dental offices where nitrous oxide is used with the absence of anesthetic gas scavenging equipment, there is a greater risk of miscarriage. For women who work with cytotoxic antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents there is a small increased risk of miscarriage. No increased risk for cosmetologists has been found.\n\nAlcohol increases the risk of miscarriage. Progesterone has not been found to be effective in preventing miscarriage. Cocaine use increases the rate of miscarriage. Some infections have been associated with miscarriage. These include \"Ureaplasma urealyticum\", \"Mycoplasma hominis\", group B streptococci, HIV-1, and syphilis. Infections of \"Chlamydia trachomatis,\" \"Camphylobacter fetus\", and \"Toxoplasma gondii\" have not been found to be linked to miscarriage.\n\nIn the case of blood loss, pain, or both, transvaginal ultrasound is performed. If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is not found with ultrasound, blood tests (serial βHCG tests) can be performed to rule out ectopic pregnancy, which is a life-threatening situation.\n\nIf hypotension, tachycardia, and anemia are discovered, exclusion of an ectopic pregnancy is important.\n\nA miscarriage may be confirmed by an obstetric ultrasound and by the examination of the passed tissue. When looking for microscopic pathologic symptoms, one looks for the products of conception. Microscopically, these include villi, trophoblast, fetal parts, and background gestational changes in the endometrium. When chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than one miscarriage, genetic testing of both parents may be done.\n\nA review article in The New England Journal of Medicine based on a consensus meeting of the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound in America (SRU) has suggested that miscarriage should be diagnosed only if any of the following criteria are met upon ultrasonography visualization:\nA threatened miscarriage describes any bleeding during pregnancy, prior to viability, that has yet to be assessed.. At investigation it may be found that the fetus remains viable and the pregnancy continues without further problems.\n\nAn anembryonic pregnancy (also called an \"empty sac\" or \"blighted ovum\") is a condition where the gestational sac develops normally, while the embryonic part of the pregnancy is either absent or stops growing very early. This accounts for approximately half of miscarriages. All other miscarriages are classified as embryonic miscarriages, meaning that there is an embryo present in the gestational sac. Half of embryonic miscarriages have aneuploidy (an abnormal number of chromosomes).\n\nAn inevitable miscarriage occurs when the cervix has already dilated, but the fetus has yet to be expelled. This usually will progress to a complete miscarriage. The fetus may or may not have cardiac activity.\n\nA missed miscarriage is when the embryo or fetus has died, but a miscarriage has not yet occurred. It is also referred to as delayed miscarriage, silent miscarriage, or missed abortion.\n\nA septic miscarriage occurs when the tissue from a missed or incomplete miscarriage becomes infected, which carries the risk of spreading infection (septicaemia) and can be fatal.\n\nRecurrent miscarriage (\"recurrent pregnancy loss\" (RPL) or \"habitual abortion\") is the occurrence of multiple consecutive miscarriages; the exact number used to diagnose recurrent miscarriage varies. If the proportion of pregnancies ending in miscarriage is 15% and assuming that miscarriages are independent events, then the probability of two consecutive miscarriages is 2.25% and the probability of three consecutive miscarriages is 0.34%. The occurrence of recurrent pregnancy loss is 1%. A large majority (85%) of those who have had two miscarriages will conceive and carry normally afterward.\n\nThe physical symptoms of a miscarriage vary according to the length of pregnancy, though most miscarriages cause pain or cramping. The size of blood clots and pregnancy tissue that are passed become larger with longer gestations. After 13 weeks' gestation, there is a higher risk of placenta retention.\n\nPrevention of a miscarriage can sometimes be accomplished by decreasing risk factors. This may include good prenatal care, avoiding drugs and alcohol, preventing infectious diseases, and avoiding x-rays. Identifying the cause of the miscarriage may help prevent future pregnancy loss, especially in cases of recurrent miscarriage. Often there is little a person can do to prevent a miscarriage. Vitamin supplementation before or during pregnancy has not been found to affect the risk of miscarriage.\n\nPreventing a miscarriage in subsequent pregnancies may be enhanced with assessments of:\n\nMaintaining a healthy weight and good pre-natal care can reduce the risk of miscarriage. Some risk factors can be minimized by avoiding the following:\n\nWomen who miscarry early in their pregnancy usually do not require any subsequent medical treatment but they can benefit from support and counseling. Most early miscarriages will complete on their own; in other cases, medication treatment or aspiration of the products of conception can be used to remove remaining tissue. While bed rest has been advocated to prevent miscarriage, this has not been found to be of benefit. Those who are or who have experienced an abortion benefit from the use of careful medical language. Significant distress can often be managed by the ability of the clinician to clearly explain terms without suggesting that the woman or couple are somehow to blame.\n\nEvidence to support Rho(D) immune globulin after a spontaneous miscarriage is unclear. In the UK, Rho(D) immune globulin is recommended in Rh-negative women after 12 weeks gestational age and before 12 weeks gestational age in those who need surgery or medication to complete the miscarriage.\n\nNo treatment is necessary for a diagnosis of complete miscarriage (so long as ectopic pregnancy is ruled out). In cases of an incomplete miscarriage, empty sac, or missed abortion there are three treatment options: watchful waiting, medical management, and surgical treatment. With no treatment (watchful waiting), most miscarriages (65–80%) will pass naturally within two to six weeks. This treatment avoids the possible side effects and complications of medications and surgery, but increases the risk of mild bleeding, need for unplanned surgical treatment, and incomplete miscarriage. Medical treatment usually consists of using misoprostol (a prostaglandin) to contract the uterus, expelling remaining tissue out of the cervix. This works within a few days in 95% of cases. Vacuum aspiration or sharp curettage can be used, though vacuum aspiration is lower-risk and more common.\n\nIn delayed or incomplete miscarriage, treatment depends on the amount of tissue remaining in the uterus. Treatment can include surgical removal of the tissue with vacuum aspiration or misoprostol. Studies looking at the methods of anaesthesia for surgical management of incomplete miscarriage have not shown that any adaptation from normal practice is beneficial. Some organizations recommend delaying sexual relations immediately after a miscarriage to prevent infection. However, there is not sufficient evidence for the routine use of antibiotic to try to avoid infection in incomplete abortion.\n\nAn induced abortion may be performed by a physician for women who do not want to continue the pregnancy. Self-induced abortion performed by a woman or non-medical personnel is extremely dangerous and is still a cause of maternal mortality in some countries. In some locales it is illegal or carries heavy social stigma.\n\nOrganizations exist that provide information and counseling to help those who have had a miscarriage. Family and friends often conduct a memorial or burial service. Hospitals also can provide support and help memorialize the event. Depending on locale others desire to have a private ceremony. Providing appropriate support with frequent discussions and sympathetic counseling are part of evaluation and treatment. Those who experience unexplained miscarriage can be treated with emotional support.\n\nEvery woman's personal experience of miscarriage is different, and women who have more than one miscarriage may react differently to each event.\n\nIn Western cultures since the 1980s, medical providers assume that experiencing a miscarriage \"is a major loss for all pregnant women\". A miscarriage can result in anxiety, depression or stress for those involved. It can have an effect on the whole family. Many of those experiencing a miscarriage go through a grieving process. \"Prenatal attachment\" often exists that can be seen as parental sensitivity, love and preoccupation directed toward the unborn child. Serious emotional impact is usually experienced immediately after the miscarriage. Some may go through the same loss when an ectopic pregnancy is terminated. In some, the realization of the loss can take weeks. Providing family support to those experiencing the loss can be challenging because some find comfort in talking about the miscarriage while others may find the event painful to discuss. The father can have the same sense of loss. Expressing feelings of grief and loss can sometimes be harder for men. Some women are able to begin planning their next pregnancy after a few weeks of having the miscarriage. For others, planning another pregnancy can be difficult. Some facilities acknowledge the loss. Parents can name and hold their infant. They may be given mementos such as photos and footprints. Some conduct a funeral or memorial service. They may express the loss by planting a tree.\n\nSome health organizations recommend that sexual activity be delayed after the miscarriage. The menstrual cycle should resume after about three to four months. Women report that they were dissatisfied with the care they received from physicians and nurses.\n\nSome parents want to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The decision of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and want to know about the risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage or molar pregnancy, or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.\n\nThe risks of having another miscarriage vary according to the cause. The risk of having another miscarriage after a molar pregnancy is very low. The risk of another miscarriage is highest after the third miscarriage. Pre-conception care is available in some locales.\n\nThere is a significant association between miscarriage and later development of coronary artery disease, but not of cerebrovascular disease.\n\nAmong women who know they are pregnant, the miscarriage rate is roughly 10% to 20%, while rates among all fertilized zygotes are around 30% to 50%. A 2012 review found the risk of miscarriage between 5 and 20 weeks from 11% to 22%. Up to the 13th week of pregnancy, the risk of miscarriage each week was around 2%, dropping to 1% in week 14 and reducing slowly between 14 and 20 weeks.\n\nThe precise rate is not known because a large number of miscarriages occur before pregnancies become established and before the woman is aware they are pregnant. Additionally, those with bleeding in early pregnancy may seek medical care more often than those not experiencing bleeding. Although some studies attempt to account for this by recruiting women who are planning pregnancies and testing for very early pregnancy, they still are not representative of the wider population.\n\nThe prevalence of miscarriage increases with the age of both parents. In a Danish register-based study where the prevalence of miscarriage was 11%, the prevalence rose from 9% at 22 years of age to 84% by 48 years of age. Another, later study in 2013 found that when either parent was over the age of 40, the rate of known miscarriages doubled.\n\nIn 2010, 50,000 inpatient admissions for miscarriage occurred in the UK.\n\nMost affected women and family members refer to miscarriage as the loss of a baby, rather than an embryo or fetus, and healthcare providers are expected to respect and use the language that the person chooses. Clinical terms can suggest blame, increase distress, and even cause anger. Terms that are known to cause distress in those experiencing miscarriage include:\n\n\n\"Pregnancy loss\" is a broad term that describes miscarriage, ectopic and molar pregnancies. The term \"fetal death\" applies variably in different countries and contexts, sometimes incorporating weight, and gestational age from 16 weeks in Norway, 20 weeks in the US and Australia, 24 weeks in the UK to 26 weeks in Italy and Spain. A fetus that died before birth after this gestational age may be referred to as a stillbirth. Under UK law, all stillbirths should be registered, although this does not apply to miscarriages.\n\nThe medical terminology applied to experiences during early pregnancy has changed over time. Before the 1980s, health professionals used the phrase \"spontaneous abortion\" for a miscarriage and \"induced abortion\" for a termination of the pregnancy. In the late 1980s and 1990s, doctors became more conscious of their language in relation to early pregnancy loss. Some medical authors advocated change to use of \"miscarriage\" instead of \"spontaneous abortion\" because they argued this would be more respectful and help ease a distressing experience. The change was being recommended by some in the profession in Britain in the late 1990s. In 2005 the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) published a paper aiming to facilitate a revision of nomenclature used to describe early pregnancy events.\n\nSociety's reactions to miscarriage changed over time.  In the early 20th century, the focus was on the mother's physical health and the difficulties and disabilities that miscarriage could produce. Other reactions, such as the expense of medical treatments and relief at ending an unwanted pregnancy, were also heard. In the 1940s and 1950s, people were more likely to express relief, not because the miscarriage ended an unwanted or mistimed pregnancy, but because people believed that miscarriages were primarily caused by birth defects, and miscarrying meant that the family would not raise a child with disabilities. The dominant attitude in the mid-century was that a miscarriage, although temporarily distressing, was a blessing in disguise for the family, and that another pregnancy and a healthier baby would soon follow, especially if women trusted physicians and reduced their anxieties. Media articles were illustrated with pictures of babies, and magazine articles about miscarriage ended by introducing the healthy baby—usually a boy—that had shortly followed it.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, miscarriage in the US was primarily framed in terms of the individual woman's personal emotional reaction, and especially her grief over a tragic outcome. The subject was portrayed in the media with images of an empty crib or an isolated, grieving woman, and stories about miscarriage were published in general-interest media outlets, not just women's magazines or health magazines. Family members were encouraged to grieve, to memorialize their losses through funerals and other rituals, and to think of themselves as being parents.  This shift to recognizing these emotional responses was partly due to medical and political successes, which created an expectation that pregnancies are typically planned and safe, and to women's demands that their emotional reactions no longer be dismissed by the medical establishments.  It also reinforces the pro-life movement's belief that human life begins at conception or early in pregnancy, and that motherhood is a desirable life goal. The modern one-size-fits-all model of grief does not fit every woman's experience, and an expectation to perform grief creates unnecessary burdens for some women. The reframing of miscarriage as a private emotional experience brought less awareness of miscarriage and a sense of silence around the subject, especially compared to the public discussion of miscarriage during campaigns for access to birth control during the early 20th century, or the public campaigns to prevent miscarriages, stillbirths, and infant deaths by reducing industrial pollution during the 1970s.\n\nIn places where induced abortion is illegal or carries social stigma, suspicion may surround miscarriage, complicating an already sensitive issue.\n\nIn the 1960s, the use of the word \"miscarriage\" in Britain (instead of \"spontaneous abortion\") occurred after changes in legislation.\n\nDevelopments in ultrasound technology (in the early 1980s) allowed them to identify earlier miscarriages.\n\nAccording to French statutes, an infant born before the age of viability, determined to be 28 weeks, is not registered as a 'child'. If birth occurs after this, the infant is granted a certificate that allows women who have given birth to a stillborn child, to have a symbolic record of that child. This certificate can include a registered and given name with the purpose of allowing a funeral and acknowledgement of the event.\n\nMiscarriage occurs in all animals that experience pregnancy, though in such contexts it is more commonly referred to as a \"spontaneous abortion\" (the two terms are synonymous). There are a variety of known risk factors in non-human animals. For example, in sheep, miscarriage may be caused by crowding through doors, or being chased by dogs. In cows, spontaneous abortion may be caused by contagious disease, such as brucellosis or \"Campylobacter\", but often can be controlled by vaccination. In many species of sharks and rays, stress induced miscarriage occurs frequently on capture.\n\nOther diseases are also known to make animals susceptible to miscarriage. Spontaneous abortion occurs in pregnant prairie voles when their mate is removed and they are exposed to a new male, an example of the Bruce effect, although this effect is seen less in wild populations than in the laboratory. Female mice who had spontaneous abortions showed a sharp rise in the amount of time spent with unfamiliar males preceding the abortion than those who did not.\n\n"}

Its aim is to interpret the subject of world culture in an interdisciplinary way. The museum is situated next to the Universeum science centre and the amusement park Liseberg, and close to Korsvägen. \n\"The museum interprets the concept of world culture in a dynamic and open-ended manner. On the one hand, various cultures are incorporating impulses from each other and becoming more alike. On the other hand, local, national, ethnic and gender differences are shaping much of that process.

A long section of a display window provides passers-by with a view straight into the largest exhibition hall.\n\nThe architects behind the museum, who were chosen after an international competition, were the French-Cuban-English couple Cécile Brisac and Edgar Gonzalez of Brisac Gonzalez Architects.\n\nIn February 2005 the museum decided to remove the painting \"Scène d'Amour\" by Louzla Darabi. The painting was part of a temporary exhibition about HIV/AIDS, and depicted a man and a woman having sexual intercourse. The artist and the curator had received numerous death threats from Muslims saddened and frustrated over the Koran quotations which were featured in a corner of the painting. Some threats were telling the artist to \"learn from the Netherlands\", referring to the murder of van Gogh and threats against Hirsi Ali.\n\n"}

{"id": "997476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=997476", "title": "Night sky", "text": "Night sky\n\nThe term night sky, usually associated with astronomy from Earth, refers to the nighttime appearance of celestial objects like stars, planets, and the Moon, which are visible in a clear sky between sunset and sunrise, when the Sun is below the horizon.\n\nNatural light sources in a night sky include moonlight, starlight, and airglow, depending on location and timing. Aurorae light up the skies above the polar circles. Occasionally, a large coronal mass ejection from the Sun or simply high levels of solar wind may extend the phenomenon toward the Equator.\n\nThe night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. In the past, for instance, farmers have used the status of the night sky as a calendar to determine when to plant crops. Many cultures have drawn constellations between stars in the sky, using them in association with legends and mythology about their deities.\n\nThe anciently developed belief of astrology is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on Earth. The \"scientific\" study of celestial objects visible at night takes place in the science of observational astronomy.\n\nThe visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by light pollution. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of ambient brightness. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. Optical filters and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for optimal views, both professional and amateur astronomers seek locations far from urban skyglow.\n\nThe fact that the sky is not completely dark at night, even in the absence of moonlight and city lights, can be easily observed, since if the sky were absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.\n\nThe intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day and the primary cause differs as well. During daytime when the sun is above the horizon direct scattering of sunlight (Rayleigh scattering) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. In twilight, the period of time between sunset and sunrise, the situation is more complicated and a further differentiation is required. Twilight is divided in three segments according to how far the sun is below the horizon in segments of 6°.\n\nAfter sunset the civil twilight sets in, and ends when the sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the nautical twilight, when the sun reaches heights of -6° and -12°, after which comes the astronomical twilight defined as the period from -12° to -18°. When the sun drops more than 18° below the horizon the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.\n\nSeveral sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely airglow, indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial light pollution.\n\nDepending on local sky cloud cover, pollution, humidity, and light pollution levels, the stars visible to the unaided naked eye appear as hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of white pinpoints of light in an otherwise near black sky together with some faint nebulae or clouds of light . In ancient times the stars were often assumed to be equidistant on a dome above the earth because they are much too far away for stereopsis to offer any depth cues. Visible stars range in color from blue (hot) to red (cold), but with such small points of faint light, most look white because they stimulate the rod cells without triggering the cone cells. If it is particularly dark and a particularly faint celestial object is of interest, averted vision may be helpful.\n\nThe stars of the night sky cannot be counted unaided because they are so numerous and there is no way to track which have been counted and which have not. Further complicating the count, fainter stars may appear and disappear depending on exactly where the observer is looking. The result is an impression of an extraordinarily vast star field.\n\nBecause stargazing is best done from a dark place away from city lights, dark adaptation is important to achieve and maintain. It takes several minutes for eyes to adjust to the darkness necessary for seeing the most stars, and surroundings on the ground are hard to discern. A red flashlight (torch) can be used to illuminate star charts, telescope parts, and the like without undoing the dark adaptation. (See Purkinje effect).\n\nThere are no markings on the night sky, though there exist many sky maps to aid stargazers in identifying constellations and other celestial objects. Constellations are prominent because their stars tend to be brighter than other nearby stars in the sky. Different cultures have created different groupings of constellations based on differing interpretations of the more-or-less random patterns of dots in the sky. Constellations were identified without regard to distance to each star, but instead as if they were all dots on a dome.\n\nOrion is among the most prominent and recognizable constellations. The Big Dipper (which has a wide variety of other names) is helpful for navigation in the northern hemisphere because it points to Polaris, the north star.\n\nThe pole stars are special because they are approximately in line with the Earth's axis of rotation so they appear to stay in one place while the other stars rotate around them through the course of a night (or a year).\n\nPlanets, named for the Greek word for \"wanderer,\" process through the star field a little each day, executing loops with time scales dependent on the length of the planet's year or orbital period around solar system. Planets, to the naked eye, appear as points of light in the sky with variable brightness. Planets shine due to sunlight reflecting or scattering from the planets' surface or atmosphere. Thus the relative sun-planet-earth positions determine the planet's brightness. With a telescope or good binoculars, the planets appear as discs demonstrating finite size, and it is possible to observe orbiting moons which cast shadows onto the host planet's surface. Venus is the most prominent planet, often called the \"morning star\" or \"evening star\" because it is brighter than the stars and often the only \"star\" visible near sunrise or sunset, depending on its location in its orbit. Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are also visible to the naked eye.\n\nEarth's Moon is a grey disc in the sky with cratering visible to the naked eye. It spans, depending on its exact location, 29-33 arcminutes - which is about the size of a thumbnail at arm's length, and is readily identified. Over 28 days, the moon goes through a full cycle of lunar phases. People can generally identify phases within a few days by looking at the moon. Unlike stars and most planets, the light reflected from the moon is bright enough to be seen during the day. (Venus can sometimes be seen even after sunrise.)\n\nSome of the most spectacular moons come during the full moon phase near sunset or sunrise. The moon on the horizon benefits from the moon illusion which makes it appear larger. The light reflected from the moon traveling through the atmosphere also colors the moon orange and/or red.\n\nComets come to the night sky only rarely. Comets are illuminated by the sun, and their tails extend away from the sun. A comet with visible tail is quite unusual - a great comet appears about once a decade. They tend to be visible only shortly before sunrise or after sunset because those are the times they are close enough to the sun to show a tail.\n\nClouds obscure the view of other objects in the sky, though varying thicknesses of cloudcover have differing effects. A very thin cirrus cloud in front of the moon might produce a rainbow-colored ring around the moon. Stars and planets are too small or dim to take on this effect, and are instead only dimmed (often to the point of invisibility). Thicker cloudcover obscures celestial objects entirely, making the sky black or reflecting city lights back down. Clouds are often close enough to afford some depth perception, though they are hard to see without moonlight or light pollution.\n\nOn clear dark nights in unpolluted areas, when the moon is thin or below the horizon, the Milky Way, a band of what looks like white dust, can be seen.\n\nThe Magellanic Clouds of the southern sky are easily mistaken to be Earth-based clouds (hence the name) but are in fact collections of stars found outside the Milky Way known as dwarf galaxies.\n\nZodiacal light is a glow that appears near the points where the sun rises and sets, and is caused by sunlight interacting with interplanetary dust.\n\nShortly after sunset and before sunrise, artificial satellites often look like stars—similar in brightness and size—but move relatively quickly. Those that fly in low Earth orbit cross the sky in a couple of minutes. Some satellites, including space debris, appear to blink or have a periodic fluctuation in brightness because they are rotating. Satellite flares can appear brighter than Venus, with notable examples including the International Space Station (ISS) and Iridium Satellites.\n\nMeteors (commonly known as shooting stars) streak across the sky very infrequently. During a meteor shower, they may average one a minute at irregular intervals, but otherwise their appearance is a random surprise. The occasional meteor will make a bright, fleeting streak across the sky, and they can be very bright in comparison to the night sky.\n\nAircraft are also visible at night, distinguishable at a distance from other objects because their lights blink.\n\n\n"}

Farmers who do not adhere to these restrictions can be fined by the Government. The restrictions are within the guidelines of GAP (Good Agricultural Practice) and so the farmers are expected to adhere without receiving any subsidies. \n\nThese NVZs are part of the scheme involved in NSAs (nitrate sensitive areas) which are assigned on a farm scale basis and have much more stringent rules on nitrate application and also include remuneration for profits lost from keeping to the rules.\n"}

Brought up in the Black Country, he later lived in – and wrote mostly about – the countryside of north Worcestershire and at Abbots Bromley in East Staffordshire, where he created a nature reserve.\n\nDrabble was an only child, whose mother died when he was young. His father was a GP and they lived in a terraced house in Bloxwich. He began work as a factory lad and rose to the board of Salters and membership of the management board of the Midland Engineering Employers Association.\n\nIn 1947, he made his first radio broadcast, and in 1952 his first television appearance. At the age of 47 he became a full-time writer, and he and his wife Jess purchased a derelict folly-styled cottage and of neglected ancient woodland in Abbots Bromley, Staffordshire, a remnant of the Needwood Forest.\n\nDrabble was best known as presenter of the long-running TV series \"One Man and His Dog\", in which he commentated on sheepdog trials for 17 years from 1976 to 1993. At its peak the BBC programme attracted more than 8 million viewers and even the Queen was a fan, asking Drabble for advice after her liberty budgies were attacked by hawks at Windsor. Declared Midlander of the Year in 1992, and made OBE in the year he retired from the programme, he announced in 1993 that it had become \"a bit boring watching dogs chase stroppy sheep round a field.\"\n\nA pub very near Drabble's former home in Bloxwich is named \"One Man and His Dog\" in his honour.\n\nDrabble, who also wrote a newspaper column for the Express & Star, took few holidays, travelled abroad only a couple of times, and was proud to have never lived more than 20 miles from his place of birth.\n\nHe and his wife turned the woodland they had bought and lived next to into the Goat Lodge Reserve.

{"id": "210537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210537", "title": "Renewable resource", "text": "Renewable resource\n\nA renewable resource is a natural resource which replenishes to overcome resource depletion caused by usage and consumption, either through biological reproduction or other naturally recurring processes in a finite amount of time in a human time scale. Renewable resources are a part of Earth's natural environment and the largest components of its ecosphere. A positive life cycle assessment is a key indicator of a resource's sustainability.\n\nDefinitions of renewable resources may also include agricultural production, as in sustainable agriculture and to an extent water resources. In 1962, Paul Alfred Weiss defined Renewable Resources as: \"The total range of living organisms providing man with food, fibres, etc...\". Another type of renewable resources is renewable energy resources. Common sources of renewable energy include solar, geothermal and wind power, which are all categorised as renewable resources.\n\nWater can be considered a \"renewable\" material when carefully controlled usage, treatment, and release are followed. If not, it would become a non-renewable resource at that location. For example, groundwater is usually removed from an aquifer at a rate much greater than its very slow natural recharge, and so groundwater is considered non-renewable. Removal of water from the pore spaces may cause permanent compaction (subsidence) that cannot be renewed. 97.5% of the water on the Earth is salt water, and 3% is fresh water; slightly over two thirds of this is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. The remaining unfrozen freshwater is found mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction (0.008%) present above ground or in the air.\n\nWater pollution is one of the main concerns regarding water resources. It is estimated that 22% of worldwide water is used in industry. Major industrial users include hydroelectric dams, thermoelectric power plants (which use water for cooling), ore and oil refineries (which use water in chemical processes) and manufacturing plants (which use water as a solvent).\n\nDesalination of seawater is considered a renewable source of water, although reducing its dependence on fossil fuel energy is needed for it to be fully renewable.\n\nFood is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. Most food has its origin in renewable resources. Food is obtained directly from plants and animals.\n\nHunting may not be the first source of meat in the modernised world, but it is still an important and essential source for many rural and remote groups. It is also the sole source of feeding for wild carnivores.\n\nThe phrase sustainable agriculture was coined by Australian agricultural scientist Gordon McClymont. It has been defined as \"an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will last over the long term\". Expansion of agricultural land reduces biodiversity and contributes to deforestation. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades, cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development, along with reclamation of wetlands, and conversion of forest to cultivation, resulting in the loss of biodiversity and increased soil erosion.\nAlthough air and sunlight are available everywhere on Earth, crops also depend on soil nutrients and the availability of water. Monoculture is a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field, which can damage land and cause it to become either unusable or suffer from reduced yields. Monoculture can also cause the build-up of pathogens and pests that target one specific species. The Great Irish Famine (1845–1849) is a well-known example of the dangers of monoculture.\n\nCrop rotation and long-term crop rotations confer the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of green manure in sequence with cereals and other crops, and can improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants. Other methods to combat lost soil nutrients are returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients indefinitely) such as the Flooding of the Nile, the long-term use of biochar, and use of crop and livestock landraces that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.\n\nAgricultural practices are the single greatest contributor to the global increase in soil erosion rates. It is estimated that \"more than a thousand million tonnes of southern Africa's soil are eroded every year. Experts predict that crop yields will be halved within thirty to fifty years if erosion continues at present rates.\" The Dust Bowl phenomenon in the 1930s was caused by severe drought combined with farming methods that did not include crop rotation, fallow fields, cover crops, soil terracing and wind-breaking trees to prevent wind erosion.\n\nThe tillage of agricultural lands is one of the primary contributing factors to erosion, due to mechanised agricultural equipment that allows for deep plowing, which severely increases the amount of soil that is available for transport by water erosion.\nThe phenomenon called \"peak soil\" describes how large-scale factory farming techniques are affecting humanity's ability to grow food in the future. Without efforts to improve soil management practices, the availability of arable soil may become increasingly problematic.\n\nMethods to combat erosion include no-till farming, using a keyline design, growing wind breaks to hold the soil, and widespread use of compost. Fertilizers and pesticides can also have an effect of soil erosion, which can contribute to soil salinity and prevent other species from growing. Phosphate is a primary component in the chemical fertiliser applied most commonly in modern agricultural production. However, scientists estimate that rock phosphate reserves will be depleted in 50–100 years and that \"Peak Phosphate\" will occur in about 2030.\n\nIndustrial processing and logistics also have an effect on agriculture's sustainability. The way and locations crops are sold requires energy for transportation, as well as the energy cost for materials, labour, and transport. Food sold at a local location, such a farmers' market, have reduced energy overheads.\n\nAir is a renewable resource. All living organisms need oxygen, nitrogen (directly or indirectly), carbon (directly or indirectly) and many other gases in small quantities for their survival.\n\nAn important renewable resource is wood provided by means of forestry, which has been used for construction, housing and firewood since ancient times.\n\nWith regard to pharmacy ingredients and legal and illegal drugs, plants are important sources, however e.g. venom of snakes, frogs and insects has been a valuable renewable source of pharmacological ingredients. Before GMO production set in, insulin and important hormones were based on animal sources. Feathers, an important byproduct of poultry farming for food, is still being used as filler and as base for keratin in general. Same applies for the chitin produced in farming Crustaceans which may be used as base of chitosan. The most important part of the human body used for non-medical purposes is human hair as for artificial hair integrations, which is being traded worldwide.\n\nHistorically, renewable resources like firewood, latex, guano, charcoal, wood ash, plant colors as indigo, and whale products have been crucial for human needs but failed to supply demand in the beginning of the industrial era. Early modern times faced large problems with overuse of renewable resources as in deforestation, overgrazing or overfishing.\n\nIn addition to fresh meat and milk, which as food items are not the topic of this section, livestock farmers and artisans used further animal ingredients as tendons, horn, bones, bladders. Complex technical constructions as the composite bow were based on combination of animal and plant based materials. The current distribution conflict between biofuel and food production is being described as Food vs. fuel. Conflicts between food needs and usage, as supposed by fief obligations were in so far common in historical times as well. However, a significant percentage of (middle European) farmers yields went into livestock, which provides as well organic fertiliser. Oxen and horses were important for transportation purposes, drove engines as e.g. in treadmills.\n\nOther regions solved the transportation problem with terracing, urban and garden agriculture. Further conflicts as between forestry and herding, or (sheep) herders and cattle farmers led to various solutions. Some confined wool production and sheep to large state and nobility domains or outsourced to professional shepherds with larger wandering herds.\n\nThe British Agricultural Revolution was mainly based on a new system of crop rotation, the four-field rotation. British agriculturist Charles Townshend recognised the invention in Dutch Waasland and popularised it in the 18th century UK, George Washington Carver in the USA. The system used wheat, turnips and barley and introduced as well clover. Clover is able to fix nitrogen from air, a practically non exhaustive renewable resource, into fertilizing compounds to the soil and allowed to increase yields by large. Farmers opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop. Thus livestock could to be bred year-round and winter culling was avoided. The amount of manure rose and allowed more crops but to refrain from wood pasture.\n\nEarly modern times and the 19th century saw the previous resource base partially replaced respectively supplemented by large scale chemical synthesis and by the use of fossil and mineral resources respectively. Besides the still central role of wood, there is a sort of renaissance of renewable products based on modern agriculture, genetic research and extraction technology. Besides fears about an upcoming global shortage of fossil fuels, local shortages due to boycotts, war and blockades or just transportation problems in remote regions have contributed to different methods of replacing or substituting fossil resources based on renewables.\n\nThe use of certain basically renewable products as in TCM endangers various species. Just the black market in rhinoceros horn reduced the world's rhino population by more than 90 percent over the past 40 years.\n\nThe success of the German chemical industry till World War I was based on the replacement of colonial products. The predecessors of IG Farben dominated the world market for synthetic dyes at the beginning of the 20th century and had an important role in artificial pharmaceuticals, photographic film, agricultural chemicals and electrochemicals.\n\nHowever the former Plant breeding research institutes took a different approach. After the loss of the German colonial empire, important players in the field as Erwin Baur and Konrad Meyer switched to using local crops as base for economic autarky. Meyer as a key agricultural scientist and spatial planner of the Nazi era managed and lead Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft resources and focused about a third of the complete research grants in Nazi Germany on agricultural and genetic research and especially on resources needed in case of a further German war effort. A wide array of agrarian research institutes still existing today and having importance in the field was founded or enlarged in the time.\n\nThere were some major failures as trying to e.g. grow frost resistant olive species, but some success in the case of hemp, flax, rapeseed, which are still of current importance. During World War 2, German scientists tried to use Russian Taraxacum (dandelion) species to manufacture natural rubber. Rubber dandelions are still of interest, as scientists in the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) announced 2013 to have developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber.\n\nSeveral legal and economic means have been used to enhance the market share of renewables.\nThe UK uses Non-Fossil Fuel Obligations (NFFO), a collection of orders requiring the electricity Distribution Network Operators in England and Wales to purchase electricity from the nuclear power and renewable energy sectors. Similar mechanisms operate in Scotland (the Scottish Renewable Orders under the Scottish Renewables Obligation) and Northern Ireland (the Northern Ireland Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation). In the USA, Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), use a similar approach. German Energiewende is using fed-in tariffs. An unexpected outcome of the subsidies was the quick increase of pellet byfiring in conventional fossil fuel plants (compare Tilbury power stations) and cement works, making wood respectively biomass accounting for about half of Europe’s renewable-energy consumption.\n\nBiorenewable chemicals are chemicals created by biological organisms that provide feedstocks for the chemical industry. Biorenewable chemicals can provide solar-energy-powered substitutes for the petroleum-based carbon feedstocks that currently supply the chemical industry. The tremendous diversity of enzymes in biological organisms, and the potential for synthetic biology to alter these enzymes to create yet new chemical functionalities, can drive the chemical industry. A major platform for creation of new chemicals is the polyketide biosynthetic pathway, which generates chemicals containing repeated alkyl chain units with potential for a wide variety of functional groups at the different carbon atoms.\n\nBioplastics are a form of plastics derived from renewable biomass sources, such as vegetable fats and oils, lignin, corn starch, pea starch or microbiota. The most common form of bioplastic is thermoplastic starch. Other forms include Cellulose bioplastics, biopolyester, Polylactic acid, and bio-derived polyethylene.\n\nThe production and use of bioplastics is generally regarded as a more sustainable activity when compared to plastic production from petroleum (petroplastic); however, manufacturing of bioplastic materials is often still reliant upon petroleum as an energy and materials source. Because of the fragmentation in the market and ambiguous definitions it is difficult to describe the total market size for bioplastics, but the global production capacity is estimated at 327,000 tonnes. In contrast, global consumption of all flexible packaging is estimated at around 12.3 million tonnes.\n\nBioasphalt is an asphalt alternative made from non-petroleum based renewable resources. Manufacturing sources of bioasphalt include sugar, molasses and rice, corn and potato starches, and vegetable oil based waste. Asphalt made with vegetable oil based binders was patented by Colas SA in France in 2004.\n\nRenewable energy refers to the provision of energy via renewable resources which are naturally replenished fast enough as being used. It includes e.g. sunlight, wind, biomass, rain, tides, waves and geothermal heat. Renewable energy may replace or enhance fossil energy supply various distinct areas: electricity generation, hot water/space heating, motor fuels, and rural (off-grid) energy services.\n\nBiomass is referring to biological material from living, or recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials.\n\nSustainable harvesting and use of renewable resources (i.e., maintaining a positive renewal rate) can reduce air pollution, soil contamination, habitat destruction and land degradation. Biomass energy is derived from six distinct energy sources: garbage, wood, plants, waste, landfill gases, and alcohol fuels. Historically, humans have harnessed biomass-derived energy since the advent of burning wood to make fire, and wood remains the largest biomass energy source today.\n\nHowever, low tech use of biomass, which still amounts for more than 10% of world energy needs may induce indoor air pollution in developing nations and results in between 1.5 million and 2 million deaths in 2000.\n\nThe biomass used for electricity generation varies by region. Forest by-products, such as wood residues, are common in the United States. Agricultural waste is common in Mauritius (sugar cane residue) and Southeast Asia (rice husks). Animal husbandry residues, such as poultry litter, are common in the UK. The biomass power generating industry in the United States, which consists of approximately 11,000 MW of summer operating capacity actively supplying power to the grid, produces about 1.4 percent of the U.S. electricity supply.\n\nA biofuel is a type of fuel whose energy is derived from biological carbon fixation. Biofuels include fuels derived from biomass conversion, as well as solid biomass, liquid fuels and various biogases.\n\nBioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation, mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as corn, sugarcane or switchgrass.\n\nBiodiesel is made from vegetable oils and animal fats. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe.\n\nBiogas is methane produced by the process of anaerobic digestion of organic material by anaerobes., etc. is also a renewable source of energy.\n\nBiogas typically refers to a mixture of gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen. Biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion with anaerobic bacteria or fermentation of biodegradable materials such as manure, sewage, municipal waste, green waste, plant material, and crops. It is primarily methane () and carbon dioxide () and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulphide (), moisture and siloxanes.\n\nNatural fibres are a class of hair-like materials that are continuous filaments or are in discrete elongated pieces, similar to pieces of thread. They can be used as a component of composite materials. They can also be matted into sheets to make products such as paper or felt. Fibres are of two types: natural fibre which consists of animal and plant fibres, and man made fibre which consists of synthetic fibres and regenerated fibres.\n\nRenewable resources are endangered by non-regulated industrial developments and growth. They must be carefully managed to avoid exceeding the natural world's capacity to replenish them. A life cycle assessment provides a systematic means of evaluating renewability. This is a matter of sustainability in the natural environment.\n\n\"National Geographic\" has described ocean over fishing as \"simply the taking of wildlife from the sea at rates too high for fished species to replace themselves.\"\n\nTuna meat is driving overfishing as to endanger some species like the bluefin tuna. The European Community and other organisations are trying to regulate fishery as to protect species and to prevent their extinctions. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea treaty deals with aspects of overfishing in articles 61, 62, and 65.\n\nExamples of overfishing exist in areas such as the North Sea of Europe, the Grand Banks of North America and the East China Sea of Asia.\n\nThe decline of penguin population is caused in part by overfishing, caused by human competition over the same renewable resources\n\nBesides their role as a resource for fuel and building material, trees protect the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide and by creating oxygen. The destruction of rain forests is one of the critical causes of climate change. Deforestation causes carbon dioxide to linger in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide accrues, it produces a layer in the atmosphere that traps radiation from the sun. The radiation converts to heat which causes global warming, which is better known as the greenhouse effect.\n\nDeforestation also affects the water cycle. It reduces the content of water in the soil and groundwater as well as atmospheric moisture. Deforestation reduces soil cohesion, so that erosion, flooding and landslides ensue.\n\nRain forests house many species and organisms providing people with food and other commodities. In this way biofuels may well be unsustainable if their production contributes to deforestation.\n\nSome renewable resources, species and organisms are facing a very high risk of extinction caused by growing human population and over-consumption. It has been estimated that over 40% of all living species on Earth are at risk of going extinct. Many nations have laws to protect hunted species and to restrict the practice of hunting. Other conservation methods include restricting land development or creating preserves. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system. Internationally, 199 countries have signed an accord agreeing to create Biodiversity Action Plans to protect endangered and other threatened species.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47811060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47811060", "title": "Takeminakata", "text": "Takeminakata\n\nThe Suwa deity is the subject of a number of different, often conflicting myths. For instance, in the \"Kojiki\" (720 CE) and later derivative accounts, Takeminakata appears as one of the sons of Ōkuninushi, god of Izumo and lord of Ashihara no Nakatsukuni (i.e. the land of Japan), who was forced into exile in the region of Suwa after being defeated by Takemikazuchi, an envoy sent by the gods of heaven, whereas other stories portray the god as being among other things a heavenly deity who conquered the Suwa region, an enlightened ruler of an Indian kingdom, a bodiless entity, or even a human warrior named Kōga Saburō.\n\nThe god is named 'Takeminakata' ( \"Takeminakata-no-Kami\") in both the \"Kojiki\" and the \"\"Sendai Kuji Hongi\"\" (aka \"Kujiki\"). Variants of the name found in the imperially commissioned national histories and other literary sources include 'Minakatatomi' ( \"Minakatomi-no-Kami\" or \"Minakatatomi-no-Mikoto-no-Kami\") or 'Takeminakatatomi' ( \"Takeminakatatomi-no-Mikoto-no-Kami\").\n\nThe name's etymology is unclear. While most commentators seem to agree that \"take-\" (and probably \"-tomi\") are honorifics, they differ in how to interpret the other components of the name. Some of the proposed solutions are as follows.\n\n\nA common epithet for the god enshrined in Suwa Grand Shrine – specifically, in the Upper Shrine (\"Kamisha\") located southeast of Lake Suwa – since the Middle Ages is \"Suwa Myōjin\" () or \"Suwa Daimyōjin\" (), a name also applied via metonymy to the shrine itself. A variant associated with the syncretic Ryōbu Shintō sect, \"Suwa (Nangū) Hosshō (Kamishimo) Daimyōjin\" (諏訪(南宮)法性(上下)大明神), \"Dharma-Nature \"Daimyōjin\" of (the Upper and Lower) Suwa (\"Nangū\"</ref> is uncertain: suggestions include the name being a reference to the geographical location of the Suwa \"Kamisha\" (Upper Shrine) on the south of Lake Suwa, it having a supposed connection to Nangū Shrine in modern Gifu Prefecture, or it deriving from 'Minakata', here understood as meaning 'south(ern)' (南方).}}),\" was most famously employed by Sengoku \"daimyō\" Takeda Shingen (a devotee of the god) on some of his war banners.\n\nWhile the deity of Suwa Shrine, officially named '(Take)minakata(tomi)' in the imperially-commissioned national histories of Japan, is already associated with the Takeminakata of the \"Kojiki\" (a son of Ōkuninushi and a deity of Izumo Province) in the \"Sendai Kuji Hongi\" (compiled 807-936 CE), an identification repeated and popularized by the \"Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba\" (1356), other myths and legends, some from within Suwa itself, give completely different accounts of the god's origin and nature. In fact, most of the religious rituals of Suwa Shrine are actually not so much concerned with the official identities of its deities but with their character as Mishaguji, local agricultural and fertility deities. The name 'Takeminakata' in fact does not appear in historical records of the Upper Shrine's ceremonies; rather, the focus of worship in many of these rituals are often identified in these texts as the Mishaguji.\n\nTo reflect this distinction, this article shall use 'Takeminakata (of Izumo)' to refer to the figure described in the \"Kojiki\", the \"Kuji Hongi\", and other sources which use the name or some variant thereof, and 'Suwa Myōjin' or 'the Suwa deity' to refer to the god of Suwa Shrine as portrayed in other myths and in his capacity as shrine deity.\n\nTakeminaka is portrayed in both the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Sendai Kuji Hongi\" as a son of earthly deity (\"kunitsukami\") Ōkuninushi, ruler of Izumo Province. The \"Kojiki\" does not include him in its genealogy of Ōkuninushi's children, although the corresponding section in the \"Kuji Hongi\" reckons him as the son of one of Ōkuninushi's wives, Nunakawahime of Koshi.\n\nTakeminakata appears in the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Kuji Hongi\" in the context of Ōkuninushi's \"transfer of the land\" (\"kuni-yuzuri\") to the \"amatsukami\", the gods of heaven (Takamagahara).\n\nWhen the gods of Takamagahara sent Takemikazuchi and another messenger to demand that Ōkuninushi relinquish his authority over the Central Land of Reed-Plains (Ashihara no Nakatsukuni) to the progeny of the sun goddess Amaterasu, he asked to confer with two sons of his first before giving his decision. While the first son, Kotoshironushi, immediately accepted their demands and advised his father to do likewise, the second, Takeminakata, carrying an enormous rock (千引之石 \"chibiki no ishi\", i.e. a boulder so large it would take a thousand men to pull) on the fingertips of one hand, challenged Takemikazuchi to a test of strength, grabbing the messenger's arm.\n\nUpon having his arm seized by Takeminakata, Takemikazuchi transformed it into an icicle and then a sword blade, preventing Takeminakata from holding onto it. In return, Takemikazuchi grasped Takeminakata's arm, crushing it like a reed and throwing it (or him) aside. The injured Takeminakata then fled in fear, pursued by the heavenly messenger. Upon arriving at \"the sea of Suwa in the province of Shinano\" (科野国州羽海), Takeminakata begged for his life, vowing not to leave Shinano at any pretext.\n\nWith Takeminakata's surrender, Ōkuninushi finally agreed to cede the land to the heavenly deities.\n\nThe opening section of the \"Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba\" gives a summary of the \"Kuji Hongi\" version of this story, notably omitting any mention of Takeminakata's defeat under Takemikazuchi.\n\nAmaterasu-Ōmikami gave a decree and sent two gods, Futsunushi-no-Kami (of Katori Shrine in Sōshū) and Takeikatsuchi-no-Kami (of Kashima Shrine in Jōshū), down to the land of Izumo, where they declared to Ōanamuchi (of Kitsuki in Unshū [and] Miwa in Washū), \"The Central Land of Reed-Plains is the land entrusted to our heir. Are you willing to give it up to the heavenly deities?\"\nŌanamuchi said, \"Ask my son, Kotoshironushi-no-Kami (of Nagata Shrine in Sesshū; eighth [patron deity of] the Jingi-kan); he will give you an answer.\"\nKotoshironushi-no-Kami said, \"My father ought respectfully to withdraw, nor will I disobey.\"\n[The messengers said,] \"Do you have any other sons who ought to speak?\"\n\"There is also my son, Takeminakata-no-Kami (of Suwa Shrine).\"\n[He] came, bearing a boulder that would take a thousand men to pull (\"chibiki no ishi\") on his fingertips, saying, \"Who is this that has come to our land, talking so furtively? I wish to challenge you to a test of strength.\"\nWhen he took his hand, it turned into an icicle, and then it turned into a sword blade [or 'he took a sword']. Upon arriving at the sea of Suwa in the land of Shinano, Takeminakata-no-Kami said, \"I will go to no other place but this,\" etc. This is the origin story of this shrine's manifestation (当社垂迹の本縁 \"tōsha suijaku no hon'en\").\n\nA local legend in Shimoina District claims that Takemikazuchi caught up with the fleeing Takeminakata in the modern village of Toyooka, at which they both agreed to cease hostilities. The two then left imprints of their hands on a rock as a sign of their agreement. The rock, bearing the gods' supposed handprints (\"tegata\"), is found in Otegata Shrine (御手形神社) in Toyooka. After Takemikazuchi's departure, Takeminakata temporarily resided in the neighboring village of Ōshika, hunting deer in the mountains, before making his way northward to Suwa. While there, he is reputed to have discovered the saltwater hot springs Ōshika is known for.\n\nIn a few late retellings of the story, Takeminakata goes to Suwa not so much to flee from Takemikazuchi but to pacify it under the orders of his father Ōkuninushi.\n\nThe contest between Takemikazuchi and Takeminakata has also sometimes been interpreted as an origin myth for sumo wrestling.\n\nWhereas the place where Takeminakata was caught, \"the sea of Suwa,\" is commonly understood as referring to Lake Suwa in Nagano, there have been a number of attempts in the past to identify this \"Suwa\" with other areas, such as the provinces of Suō (based on its proximity to Izumo and the claimed similarity between the two toponyms) or Hizen (cf. Suwa Shrine in Nagasaki).\n\nBefore the abolition of the Suwa Grand Shrine's traditional priestly offices during the Meiji period, the Upper Shrine of Suwa's high priest or \"Ōhōri\" (大祝 'great priest'; also \"Ōhafuri\") was a young boy chosen from the Suwa clan, who was, during his term of office, considered to be a living god, the visible incarnation or 'body' of the unseen Suwa deity.\n\nThe legend of how Suwa Myōjin chose his first priest is recounted in various sources, such as the \"Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba\":\n\nAt the beginning of the god's manifestation, he took off his robe, put them on an eight-year-old boy, and dubbed him 'great priest' (\"Ōhōri\"). The god declared, \"I do not have a body and so make this priest (\"hōri\") my body.\"\nThis [boy] is Arikazu (有員), the priest of the sacred robe (御衣祝 \"Misogihōri\"), the founding ancestor of the Miwa/Jin (神, i.e. Suwa) clan.\n\nAlthough most sources (such as the \"Ekotoba\" above) identify the boy with the semi-legendary priest Arikazu, who is said to have lived during the reign of Emperor Kanmu (781-806) or his immediate successors Heizei (806-809) or Saga (809-823), two recently discovered genealogical lists - of disputed historical reliability - instead identify the first priest with Otoei (乙頴) or Kumako (神子 or 熊古), a son of Mase-gimi (麻背君) or Iotari (五百足), head of the Kanesashi (金刺, also 'Kanasashi') clan and \"kuni no miyatsuko\" of Shinano Province during the late 6th century.\n\nOne of these two texts is a genealogy of the Aso (阿蘇) clan of Aso Shrine in Kyushu known as the 異本阿蘇氏系図 (\"Ihon Asoshi Keizu\"). It reads in part:\n\nOtoei (\"Ōhōri\" of the great god of Suwa): also known as Kumako (神子) or Kumako (熊古).\nWhen he was eight years old, the great god Minakatatomi-no-Mikoto appeared, took off his robe and put them on Kumako, declaring, \"I do not have a body and so make you my body.\" In the third month of the second year of Iware Ikebe no Ōmiya (587), a sanctuary (社壇) was built at the foot of the mountain at the southern side of the lake (i.e. Lake Suwa) to worship the great god of Suwa and various other gods ...\n\nThe other is the \"Ōhōri-ke Jinshi Keizu\" (大祝家神氏系図), a genealogy of the Suwa clan discovered in the \"Ōhōri\"'s residence in 1884 (Meiji 17). It portrays Arikazu as a descendant of Kumako, the priest chosen by the deity (identified here as Takeminakata of Izumo):\n\nWhen Kumako was eight years old, the revered deity appeared, took off his robe and put them on Kumako. After declaring, \"I do not have a body and so make you my body,\" he disappeared. This [Kumako] is the ancestor of Arikazu of the Miwa/Jin (Suwa) clan, the \"Misogihōri\". In the second year of Emperor Yōmei, Kumako built a sanctuary at the foot of the mountain at the southern side of the lake.\n\nWhereas the \"Kojiki\" portrays Takeminakata as an earthly god defeated by a deity from heaven, a myth from Suwa itself features the exact opposite scenario, in which Takeminakata / Suwa Myōjin is the heavenly deity who descends and conquers the land below.\n\nA petition (解状 \"gejō\") submitted to the Kamakura shogunate in 1249 by Suwa Nobushige, then high priest of the Upper Shrine, recounts an origin myth of the Upper Shrine wherein the Suwa deity - here unnamed - is portrayed as coming down from the heavens to wrest control of the land of Suwa from 'Moriya Daijin'.\n\nA medieval Buddhist legend portrays Suwa Myōjin as a king from India who later achieved enlightenment and went to Japan to become a native \"kami\".\n\nA short text attached to an ordinance regulating the Upper Shrine's ritual purity taboos (物忌み \"monoimi\") originally enforced in 1238 and revised in 1317, the \"Suwa Kamisha monoimi no rei no koto\" (諏訪上社物忌令之事), relates that the Suwa deity, 'Takeminakata Myōjin' (武御名方明神), was originally the ruler of a certain Indian kingdom called 'Hadai' (波堤国 \"Hadai-koku\") who survived an insurrection instigated by the rebel Moriya (守屋 or 守洩) during the king's absence while the latter was out hunting deer. After going to Persia to rescue its inhabitants from an evil dragon, the king ruled over it for some time as 'Emperor Suwa' (陬波皇帝 \"Suwa Kōtei\") before retiring to \"cultivate the seedling of virtue and realize the Buddhist path.\" He eventually manifested in Japan, appearing in various places before finally choosing to dwell in Suwa.\n\nThe \"Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba\" relates a slightly different, fuller version of the first half of this story as an origin myth for the Upper Shrine's hunting ceremony held every seventh month of the year at Misayama (御射山) on the slopes of the Yatsugatake Mountains:\n\nIf one should inquire about the origins (因縁 \"in'en\", lit. 'causes and conditions') of this hunt: long ago, the Daimyōjin was the king of the land of Hadai in India who went out to hunt at Deer Park from the twenty-seventh to the thirtieth day of the seventh month. At that time, a traitorous vassal named Bikyō (美教) suddenly organized an army and sought to kill the king. The king, ringing a golden bell, looked up to heaven and shouted eight times: \"I am now about to be killed by this rebel. I have hunted animals, not for my own enjoyment, but in order to lead them to the Buddhist path. If this my action is in accordance with Heaven's will, may Brahmā save me.\"\nBrahmā then saw this and commanded the four great deva-kings to wield vajra-poles and destroy the army. It is said that the Misayama (三齋山) of today reflects that event. ... One should know, therefore, that the deity's compassionate hunting is an expedient means for the salvation of creatures.\n\nRegarding the Upper Shrine's hunting rituals, the \"Monoimi no rei\" asserts that\n\n[The shrine's] hunts began in the deer park of Hadai-no-kuni [in India]. [The use of] hawks began in Magada-no-kuni.\n\nThe second half of the legend (the slaying of the dragon in Persia and the king's migration to Japan) is used by the \"Ekotoba\"'s compiler, Suwa Enchū, in a liturgical text, the \"Suwa Daimyōjin Kōshiki\" (諏方大明神講式), where it is introduced as an alternative, if somewhat less credible, account of the Suwa deity's origins (in comparison to the myth of Takeminakata of Izumo as found in the \"Kuji Hongi\", touted by the same text as the authoritative origin story of the god) that nevertheless should not be suppressed.\n\nThe \"Suwa Daimyōjin Kōshiki\" claims the king of Hadai to be a great-great-grandson of King Siṃhahanu (獅子頬王 \"Shishikyō-ō\"), Gautama Buddha's grandfather.\n\nA similar account appears in a work known as the \"Suwa Jinja Engi\" (諏訪神社縁起) or \"Suwa Shintō Engi\" (諏訪神道縁起), wherein the Suwa deity is identified as the son of Kibonnō (貴飯王), the son of Amṛtodana (甘呂飯王 \"Kanrobonnō\"), one of Siṃhahanu's four sons. The Lower Shrine's goddess, meanwhile, is the daughter of Prasenajit (波斯匿王 \"Hashinoku-ō\"), claimed here to be the son of Dronodana (黒飯王 \"Kokubonnō\"), another son of Siṃhananu.\n\nDuring the Misayama festival as performed during the medieval period, the \"Ōhōri\" recited a ritual declaration supposedly composed by the Suwa deity himself known as the \"Suwa Mishirushibumi\" (陬波御記文), which begins:\n\nI, Great King Suwa (陬波大王), have hidden my person during [the year/month/day of] the Yang Wood Horse (甲午 \"kinoe-uma\").\n[The name] 'Suwa' (陬波) and [the sign] Yang Wood Horse [and] the seal (印文) - these three are all one and the same.\n\nWithin the text, King Suwa (i.e. Suwa Myōjin) declares the \"Ōhōri\" to be his 'true body' (真神体 \"shin no shintai\") and the Misayama (三斎山) hunting grounds below Yatsugatake (here likened to Vulture Peak in India) to be another manifestation of himself that cleanses (斎) the three (三) evils: evil thoughts, evil speech and evil actions. He promises that whoever sets foot at Misayama will not fall into the lower, evil realms of existence (悪趣 \"akushu\"); conversely, the god condemns and disowns whoever defiles this place by cutting down its trees or digging out the soil.\n\nA commentary on the \"Mishirushibumi\", the \"Suwa Shichū\" (陬波私注 \"Personal Notes on the \"Suwa Mishirusibumi\",\" written 1313-1314), elaborates on the text by retelling the legend of Suwa Myōjin's consecration of his first priest:\n\nThe Daimyōjin was born during [the year/month/day of] the Yang Wood Horse and disappeared during [the year/month/day of] the Yang Wood Horse.\nSokutan Daijin (続旦大臣) was the Daimyōjin's uncle who accompanied him from India. When the Daimyōjin was to disappear, he took off his garments, put them on the Daijin, and dubbed him the \"Misogihōri\" (御衣木法理). He then pronounced a vow: \"You shall consider this priest to be my body.\"\n\nThe same text identifies the god's uncle Sokutan Daijin with Arikazu.\n\nA popular story promulgated by wandering preachers associated with the shrines of Suwa during the medieval period claimed the Suwa deity to have originally been a man who temporarily became a dragon or a snake after a journey into the underworld. Many variants on the basic story exist; the following summary is based on the earliest literary version of the tale found in the \"Shintōshū\".\n\nThe third son of a local landlord of Kōka District in Ōmi Province, a distinguished warrior named Kōga Saburō Yorikata (甲賀三郎諏方) was searching for his lost wife, Princess Kasuga (春日姫 \"Kasuga-hime\") in a cave in Mount Tateshina in Shinano, with his two elder brothers. The second brother, who was jealous of Saburō's prowess and fame and who coveted Kasuga, traps the latter inside the cave after they had rescued the princess.\n\nWith no way out, Saburō has no other choice but to go deeper into the cave, which was actually an entrance to various underground realms filled with many wonders. After travelling through these subterranean lands for a long period of time, he finally finds his way back to the surface, only to find himself transformed into a giant snake or dragon. With the help of Buddhist monks (who turn out to be gods in disguise), Saburō regains his human form and is finally reunited with his wife. Saburō eventually becomes Suwa Myōjin, the god of the Upper Shrine of Suwa, while his wife becomes the goddess of the Lower Shrine.\n\nThis version of the legend explains the origin of the name 'Suwa' (諏訪 or 諏方) via folk etymology as being derived from Saburō's personal name, Yorikata (諏方).\n\nIt has been proposed that the Kōga Saburō legend arose as a result of the collapse of the Kamakura shogunate and the downfall of the Hōjō clan, which the Suwa clan had faithfully served as retainers. The status and prestige of the \"Ōhōri\" having been diminished in the aftermath of these events, localized stories about Suwa Myōjin such as that of Kōga Saburō began to circulate among devotees of the Suwa cult.\n\nBoth the official records of the central Yamato government and local myths agree in portraying the god of Suwa as an outsider who migrated into the region. Stories of how Suwa Myōjin arrived in Suwa and established himself therein are related below.\n\nOne folk story relates that Takeminakata, upon being driven away from Izumo, first went to visit his mother Nunakawahime in Koshi before proceeding southwards into Shinano. Upon reaching Azumi (modern Kitaazumi District) on the northernmost part of the province, the local deity would not let him through the pass of Sanosaka (modern Hakuba Village). Takeminakata temporarily retreated to Mount Minekata (also in Hakuba), where messengers sent by the gods Ikushima-no-Kami (生島神) and Tarushima-no-Kami (足島神) arranged safe passage for him into the province.\n\nEn route to Suwa, Takeminakata visited the gods Ikushima and Tarushima in what is now the city of Ueda and offered them gruel.\nBefore entering Suwa, Takeminakata stayed for some time in what is now Ono Shrine in Shiojiri, as he tried to find a way to defeat the god Moreya. Ono Shrine's Nenjiribō Matsuri held in January 6th, a contest in which locals scramble for long wooden poles, is claimed in legend to have been originally devised by Takeminakata and his retinue as a way to boost their morale during their stay.\n\nOne god that opposed Suwa Myōjin upon his arrival in Suwa according to local myths was the god Moreya (Moriya).\n\nSuwa Nobushige's 1249 petition relates a story from \"the ancient customs\" (舊貫) that the Suwa deity came down from heaven in order to take possession of the land of Moriya Daijin (守屋大臣). The conflict between the two escalated into a battle, but as no winner could be declared, the two finally compete in a tug of war using hooks (\"kagi\"): Suwa Myōjin, using a hook made out of the wisteria plant (藤鎰), emerges victorious against Moriya, who used an iron hook (鐵鎰). After his victory, the god built his dwelling (what would become the Upper Shrine) in Moriya's land and planted the wisteria hook, which became a grove known as the 'Forest of Fujisuwa' (藤諏訪之森 \"Fujisuwa no mori\").\n\nThe \"Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba\" relates a variant of this myth as an origin story of Fujishima Shrine in Suwa City, one of the Upper Shrine's auxiliary shrines where its yearly rice-planting ceremony is traditionally held. In this version, the Suwa deity defeats \"Moreya the evil outlaw\" with a wisteria branch:\n\nAs for this so-called Fujishima no Myōjin (藤島明神): long ago, when the revered deity (尊神 \"sonshin\") manifested himself, Moreya the evil outlaw (洩矢の惡賊) sought to hinder the god's stay and fought him with an iron ring (鐵輪), but the \"Myōjin\", taking up a wisteria branch (藤の枝), defeated him, thus finally subduing heresy (邪輪 \"jarin\", lit. \"wheel/circle/ring of evil\") and establishing the true Dharma. When the Myōjin swore an oath and threw the wisteria branch away, immediately it took root [in the ground], its branches and leaves flourishing in abundance, and [sprouted] beautiful blossoms, leaving behind a marker of the battleground for posterity. 'Fujishima no Myōjin' is named thus for this reason.\nThe \"Suwa Daimyojin Kōshiki\" integrates this story into the legend of the king of Hadai by portraying Moreya as an incarnation of Bikyō, the rebel who raised up an army against the king in India (cf. the version in the \"Monoimi no rei\", wherein the king is opposed by a rebel named 'Moriya').\n\nIn later versions of this story which combine it with the \"kuni-yuzuri\" myth, Moreya opposes Takeminakata after the latter had fled from Izumo. After being defeated, Moreya swears fealty to Takeminakata and becomes a faithful ally. Moreya is reckoned as the divine ancestor of the Moriya (守矢) clan, one of the former priestly lineages of the Upper Shrine.\n\nWhile earlier sources such as Nobushige's petition and the \"Ekotoba\" situate the battle between the two gods somewhere in the vicinity of the Upper Shrine (modern Suwa City), modern retellings instead place it on the banks of the Tenryū River (modern Okaya City).\n\nAnother god that is said to have opposed Suwa Myōjin and his new ally Moreya in local folklore was Yatsukao-no-Mikoto (矢塚男命), also known as Ganigawara (蟹河原長者 \"Ganigawara-chōja\").\n\nAfter Moreya's defeat, Ganigawara held Moreya in contempt for surrendering to Takeminakata and had messengers publicly harass him by calling him a coward. When Ganigawara's servants began to resort to violence, Takeminakata retaliated by invading Ganigawara's turf. Mortally wounded by an arrow in the ensuing battle, Ganigawara begs forgiveness from Moreya and entrusts his youngest daughter to Takeminakata, who gives her in marriage to the god Taokihooi-no-Mikoto (手置帆負命) a.k.a. Hikosachi-no-Kami (彦狭知神), who was injured by Ganigawara's messengers as he was keeping watch over Takeminakata's abode.\n\nA few scattered local legends make reference to other deities who either submitted to the Suwa deity or refused to do so.\n\nIn one legend, a god named Takei-Ōtomonushi (武居大伴主 or 武居大友主) swore allegiance to Suwa Myōjin and became the ancestor of a line of priests in the Lower Shrine known as the \"Takeihōri\" (武居祝). Another story relates that the Suwa deity forbade the goddess of Sakinomiya Shrine in Owa, Suwa City from building a bridge over the creek before her shrine as punishment for her refusal to submit to him.\n\nTwo texts, the \"Monoimi no rei\" and the \"Suwa Shichū\" (陬波私注 \"Personal Notes on the \"Suwa Mishirusibumi\",\" written 1313-1314), mention an oral legend about Suwa Myōjin pacifying the waves of the four seas by subduing an unruly and savage toad god (蝦蟆神). After defeating the toad, Suwa Myōjin then blocked the way to its dwelling - a hole leading to the underwater palace of the dragon god of the sea, the Ryūgū-jō - with a rock and sat on it (御座石 \"Goza-ishi\" or 石(之)御座 \"ishi no goza\" \"stone seat\").\n\nThis story functions as an etiological legend for the annual sacrifice of frogs held every New Year's Day in the Suwa \"Kamisha\" (see below) as well as yet another folk etymology for the toponym 'Suwa', here explained as deriving from a term for a wave lapping onto the sea's edge (陬波 \"namishizuka\").\n\nThe portrayal of Suwa Myōjin's enemy as a toad or a frog also hints at Suwa Myōjin's character as a serpentine water god, frogs being preyed upon by snakes. (As a point of comparison, the obscure snake god Ugajin was also credited with defeating a malevolent frog deity.) The toad god itself has been interpreted either as representing the native deities Mishaguji and/or Moreya, with its defeat symbolizing the victory of the cult of Suwa Myōjin over the indigenous belief system, or as a symbol of the Buddhist concept of the three poisons (ignorance, greed, and hatred), which Suwa Myōjin, as an incarnation of the bodhisattva Samantabhadra, his esoteric aspect Vajrasattva and the Wisdom King Trailokyavijaya (interpreted as a form of Vajrasattva), is said to destroy.\n\nThe current whereabouts of the \"Goza-ishi\" is unclear. The \"Monoimi no rei\" claims it to have been located \"within the \"Shōmen\"\" (正面之内ニ在リ, i.e. the 'upper plateau' (上壇 \"jōdan\") of the \"Kamisha Honmiya\" where the inner sanctum is) and reckons it as one of seven sacred stones or rocks (七石 \"nana-ishi\") associated with the shrine. While three of the seven stones are indeed located within the \"Kamisha Honmiya\" - the \"Suzuri-ishi\" (硯石), the \"(O)kutsu-ishi\" (御沓石), and the \"Kaeru-ishi\" (蛙石) or \"Kabuto-ishi\" (甲石) - none of these are currently referred to as \"Goza-ishi\". Nevertheless, attempts have been made to identify the \"Goza-ishi\" with any one of these three rocks.\n\nHara (2012) proposes the \"Goza-ishi\" to have been the same rock as the \"Kaeru-ishi\" / \"Kabuto-ishi\" (the precise location of which is itself under dispute), noting that two sources from the Edo period both claim the \"Kaeru-ishi\" to be beneath a stone pagoda once located in the inner sanctum known as the \"Tettō\" (鉄塔 \"iron tower\"; see below), considered before the separation of Buddhism and Shinto in the Meiji period to be the physical 'body' (\"go-shintai\") of the god of Suwa and the \"Kamisha\"'s main object of worship, and that the 18th-century traveller and ethnologist Sugae Masumi (菅江真澄, 1754-1829) reported that the frogs sacrificed during the New Year's Day ritual were offered up to an \"iwakura\" (磐座, a 'rock-throne' or sacred rock) in the shrine.\n\nMeanwhile, a map of the \"Kamisha\" dating to the Tenshō period (1573-1592) depicts a rock labelled \"Goza-ishi\" located beside the Tenryūsui-sha (天流水舎), a building with a hole or pipe in its roof meant to collect the three drops of water said to miraculously trickle into it everyday no matter the weather. One author has interpreted this to mean that the \"Goza-ishi\" was moved outside the inner sanctum once Buddhism became more firmly entrenched in the shrine and \"iwakura\" worship became less important. However, no such rock currently exists beside the edifice.\n\nOutside of the \"Kamisha\", Goza-ishi Shrine (御座石神社, also \"Gozansho\") in the city of Chino, Nagano houses a stone which is sometimes identified with the elusive \"Goza-ishi\". Kanai (1982) meanwhile believed the \"Goza-ishi\" to originally refer to a large boulder in the artificial Lake Shirakaba (), a former wetland at the foot of Mount Tateshina, underneath which a cavern containing ancient pottery and stoneware - interpreted by Kanai to be ritual goods and a sign that the area once had religious significance - was discovered when a levee breach drained the lake in 1954.\n\nAccording to a local folktale, Suwa Myōjin is one of the very few \"kami\" in Japan who do not leave their shrines during the month of Kannazuki, when most gods are thought to gather at Izumo Province and thus are absent from most of the country.\n\nThe folktale relates that Suwa Myōjin once came to Izumo in the form of a dragon so gigantic that only his head can be seen; his tail was still at Suwa, caught in a tall pine tree by the shores of the lake. The other gods, upon seeing him, were so astounded and frightened at his enormous size that they exempted him from attending their yearly meetings. The supposed tree where the dragon's tail was caught (currently reduced to a stump) is locally known as \"Okakematsu\" ().\n\nA variant of this story transposes the setting from Izumo to the Imperial Palace in Kyoto; in this version, the various \"kami\" are said to travel to the ancient capital every New Year's Day to greet the emperor.\n\nCracks and ridges that form on a frozen Lake Suwa during cold winters have traditionally been interpreted as the trail left behind by Suwa Myōjin as he leaves the \"Kamisha\" and crosses the lake to meet his wife enshrined on the \"Shimosha\" on the opposite (northern) shore. Called \"Omiwatari\" (御神渡 'the god's crossing' or 'the god's pathway'), the cracks were considered to be a good omen for the coming year. The priests of the Grand Shrine of Suwa traditionally used the crack's appearance to divine the quality of the year's harvest. For the locals, the crack also served as a sign that the frozen lake was safe to walk upon. Conversely, the \"omiwatari\"'s failure to appear at all (明海 \"ake no umi\") or the cracks forming in an unusual way were held to be a sign of bad luck for the year.\n\nSince the late 20th century, the \"omiwatari\" has become a much rarer sight than it was in the past due to rising temperatures caused by global warming.\n\nThe association of Suwa Myōjin with warfare and hunting is most apparent in another legend about his apparition to the general Sakanoue no Tamuramaro during the latter's campaign to subjugate the Emishi of northeastern Japan. The following summary is based on the version found in the \"Ekotoba\".\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Kanmu, an Emishi chief named Abe no Takamaru (安倍高丸) staged a rebellion against the imperial court. The emperor, in response, appointed Sakanoue no Tamuramaro as \"Sei-i Taishōgun\", sending him to Ōshū to quell the Emishi threat. Knowing that Takamaru cannot be defeated without divine aid, Tamuramaro prays to Suwa Myōjin for victory. As he and his troops were passing by the Ina and Suwa districts of Shinano Province, a warrior riding a dapple horse – Suwa Myōjin in disguise – joins their company.\n\nUpon arriving at Takamaru's impregnable stronghold by the sea, the horseman from Shinano miraculously splits into five identical mounted warriors (the manifestations of Suwa Myōjin's thirteen divine children), while twenty men dressed in yellow (the god's attendants) appear from out of nowhere. The horsemen and the men in yellow then begin to hold a \"yabusame\" (mounted archery) competition over the surface of the sea, which succeeds in luring Takamaru out of hiding. The horseman then blinds Takamaru with his last remaining arrow as the twenty men in yellow proceed to capture and behead him, mounting his head onto a spear.\n\nOn the return journey, the warrior's horse suddenly rises into the air as the rider assumes the aspect of a deity attired in court dress. He then announces to the company his true identity as the god of Suwa and his love of hunting. Tamuramaro questions why the god revels in such an activity that involves taking the lives of sentient beings, to which Suwa Myōjin gives an explanation to the effect that being hunted and killed actually helps sinful and ignorant animals to reach enlightenment. He then bequeaths to Tamuramaro a written dhāraṇī - probably a reference to the \"Suwa Mishirushibumi\" - and finally disappears. In accordance with Suwa Myōjin's request, Tamuramaro then petitions the court to institute the religious festivals of the shrines of Suwa.\n\nSuwa Myōjin has also been credited with repelling the attempted Mongol invasions of Japan under Kublai Khan.\n\nThe \"Taiheiki\" recounts a story where a five-colored cloud resembling a serpent (a manifestation of Suwa Myōjin) rose up from Lake Suwa and spread away westward to assist the Japanese army against the Mongols. The \"Ekotoba\" recounts a similar anecdote about Suwa Myōjin appearing as a great dragon riding on a cloud in the summer of 1279 (Kōan 2).\n\nTakeminakata's rather abrupt appearance in the \"Kojiki\"'s version of the \"kuni-yuzuri\" myth has long puzzled scholars, as the god is mentioned nowhere else in the work, including the genealogy of Ōkuninushi's progeny that precedes the \"kuni-yuzuri\" narrative proper. Aside from the parallel account contained in the \"Kuji Hongi\" (which was itself based on the \"Kojiki\"'s), he is altogether absent from the \"Nihon Shoki\"'s version of the myth. In addition to this, early sources from Izumo such as the province's \"Fudoki\" also fail to mention any god named '(Take)minakata'; neither is there any trace of such a deity being worshipped in Izumo in antiquity.\n\nPre-modern authors such as Motoori Norinaga tended to explain Takeminakata's absence outside of the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Kuji Hongi\" by conflating the god with certain obscure deities found in other sources thought to share certain similar characteristics (e.g. Isetsuhiko). While some modern scholars still suppose some kind of connection between the deity and Izumo by postulating that Takeminakata's origins lie either in peoples that migrated from Izumo northwards to Suwa and the Hokuriku region or in Hokuriku itself (a region once under Izumo's sphere of influence), specifically in Echigo Province (modern Niigata Prefecture), others, in light of the aforementioned silence, think it more likely that the connection between Takeminakata and Izumo was an artificial construct by the \"Kojiki\"'s compilers.\n\nYamato rule is thought to have entered Suwa from the south (the modern districts of Kamiina and Shimoina) somewhere around the latter half of the 6th century. The appearance of corridor-type (横穴式石室 \"yokoana-shiki sekishitsu\") \"kofun\" in the region, markedly different from the mounds (thought to be the tombs of influential local priest-chiefs) built on the southern side of Lake Suwa - the site of the Suwa \"Kamisha\" - during the 5th-6th centuries, which were characterized by ditches surrounding the burial area, are taken to be the signs of the expansion of the Yamato state in the region.\nThe \"Kuji Hongi\" mentions a grandson (or descendant) of Kamuyaimimi-no-Mikoto (a son of Emperor Jimmu), Takeiotatsu-no-Mikoto, (建五百建命) who was appointed the governor or \"kuni no miyatsuko\" of Shinano (科野国造) during the reign of Emperor Sujin (traditionally dated to the 1st century BCE but most likely somewhere around the 4th century CE).\n\nThe \"Ihon Aso-shi keizu\", of disputed historicity, (see above) claims that Takeiotatsu's descendant, Kaneyumi-no-kimi (金弓君), served as \"toneri\" (舎人, attendant or palace guard) of the Emperor Kinmei (reigned 539-571) in his palace, the Kanasashi-no-miya (金刺宮) in modern-day Sakurai City, Nara Prefecture, receiving the \"kabane\" \"atai\" (直) from said emperor. One of Kaneyumi's sons, Mase-gimi (麻背君), who became the \"kuni no miyatsuko\" of Shinano (reestablished for the first time in a few generations), had two sons: the first, Kuratari (倉足), was appointed the administrator (\"kōri no kami\"/\"hyōtoku\") of Suwa district (諏訪評督), while the second, Otoei or Kumako (see above), became the priest or \"ōhōri\" of the god of Suwa (諏訪大神大祝).\n\nThe Suwa region during the late Yayoi period was thought to have been originally populated by autonomous village communities, the chiefs of which also functioned as the ritual heads of their respective communities. These villages were eventually united under a single leader who governed the religious practices of these communities, which were centered around the worship of the god(s) Mishaguji, spirits that were thought to descend upon and inhabit natural objects like trees or rocks and function as life-giving guardians of local communities.\n\nThe legend of the battle between the god Moreya and Suwa Myōjin (see above) may suggest that the advent of Yamato rule in Suwa during the late 6th century was initially met with resistance, especially on the southern side of Lake Suwa, the stronghold of the indigenous Mishaguji cult. This intransigence was ultimately quelled, and politico-religious rule over the region was soon turned over from an indigenous lineage of priest-chiefs, what would later become known as the Moriya clan (守矢氏), to Yamato-appointed authorities.\n\nIt was probably around this time that the shamanistic concept of the \"misogi-hōri\"/\"ōhōri\", the physical manifestation of an invisible divinity, came into being as a way to subsume native religious practices into the Yamato belief system. The office of \"ōhōri\" was probably meant to rival that of the \"okō\" (神使), a young boy (or boys) who became vessels for Mishaguji during religious rituals who later became interpreted as representatives of the \"ōhōri\". The priest-chieftain of the Moriya clan meanwhile was integrated into the new system as the \"kan no osa\"/\"jinchō\" (神長) or \"jinchōkan\" (神長官), the sole priest who could call upon Mishaguji.\n\nThe Moriya's submission to and cooperation with the new system enabled the local Mishaguji cult to survive underneath it: while officially subservient to the \"ōhōri\", in reality the Moriya \"jinchōkan\", who presided over religious rites, continued to hold actual power while the \"ōhōri\" was but a symbolic figurehead. The \"ōhōri\"'s investiture ceremony even involved the \"jinchōkan\" summoning Mishaguji to enter the young candidate's body during the ritual; it is only by being possessed by Mishaguji that the candidate became a god himself.\n\nBoth the Aso and the Suwa clan genealogies refer to the foundation of a sanctuary (社壇) on the southern side of Lake Suwa (where the Suwa \"Kamisha\" currently stands) by Otoei/Kumako, claimed to be in both sources as the first \"ōhōri\", where the \"great god of Suwa\" (諏訪大神) and other divinities were worshipped in the third month of the second year of the Emperor Yōmei (587 CE).\n\nIn 691 CE, the \"Nihon Shoki\" refers to envoys of the Yamato court going to Shinano Province to worship \"the gods of Suwa and Minochi\"(須波水内等神). This reference suggests that the cult of the \"ōhōri\" and the sanctuary at Suwa had become established and influential enough to attract attention from the Yamato imperial court.\n\nJust twenty years after this, the name '(Take)minakata(tomi)' - which may have originated as a name for (the deity manifest in) the \"ōhōri\" - appears in the historical record for the first time in the \"Kojiki\" (711–712 CE). Due to the absence of Takeminakata in other sources dealing with Izumo, it is thought that the god was interpolated into the \"Kojiki\" by its chief compiler, Ō no Yasumaro, who may have either adapted a preexisting myth or created one outright.\n\nScholars believe various factors were at play for Takeminakata's introduction in the \"Kojiki\"'s narrative - one being that Yasumaro's clan, the Ō (太氏; also written variously as 多, 意富, or 於保), were distantly related to the clan who ruled the Suwa region, the Kanasashi-no-toneri (金刺舎人), in that both were supposedly descendants of Kamuyaimimi-no-Mikoto: Takeminakata's inclusion in the \"Kojiki\" was thus a means to advertise the 'new' god of the Kanasashi. Another possible reason was the special interest Emperor Tenmu (the one who commissioned both the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Nihon Shoki\") showed to Shinano: the \"Nihon Shoki\" speaks of Tenmu sending envoys to inspect the province \"perhaps with the object of having a capital there\" in the thirteenth year of his reign.\n\nWhile the \"Kojiki\" does not yet explicitly mention the worship of Takeminakata in Suwa, by the following century, we see the name applied to the god worshipped in what is now the Grand Shrine of Suwa: aside from the \"Kuji Hongi\"'s (807-936 CE) reference to Takeminakata being enshrined in 'Suwa Shrine in Suwa District' the \"Shoku Nihon Kōki\" mentions the deity 'Minakatatomi-no-Kami of Suwa District, Shinano Province' (信濃国諏訪郡 ... 南方刀美神) being promoted from rankless (无位) to junior fifth rank, lower grade (従五位下) by the imperial court in the year 842 CE (Jōwa 9).\n\nDuring the 850-60s, Takeminakata and his shrine rose very rapidly in rank (\"Montoku Jitsuroku\", \"Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku\"), being promoted to the rank of junior fifth, upper grade (従五位上) in 850 (Kashō 3), to junior third (従三位) in 851 (Ninju 1), to junior (従二位) and then senior second (正二位) in 859 (Jōgan 1), and finally to junior first rank (従一位) in 867 (Jōgan 9). The influence of the Kanasashi-no-toneri clan is thought to be behind the deity's sudden progress in rank.\n\nAfter a few decades, the 'Register of Deities' (神名帳 \"Jinmyōchō\") section of the \"Engishiki\" (927) speaks of the 'Minakatatomi Shrine(s)' (南方刀美神社) as enshrining two deities and being the two major ('eminent') shrines of Suwa district. By 940 (Tengyō 3), the deity had been promoted to the highest rank of senior first (正一位).\n\nWhile the above sources (compiled by the imperial court in Heian-kyō) apply the name '(Take)minakata' to the god of Suwa Grand Shrine, within Suwa itself the god was never worshipped or referred to under that name. A testament to the enduring influence of the pre-Yamato Mishaguji belief system is the fact that many of the religious ceremonies of the Suwa \"Kamisha\" and surviving descriptions of said rituals feature Mishaguji as the focus of worship rather than 'Takeminakata', who never appears at all in these rites. Even local stories that feature the god of the Suwa \"Kamisha\" recorded in medieval texts (see above) refer to the deity in question with such generic terms as \"sonshin\" (尊神 'revered deity') or \"myōjin\" (明神 'manifest deity'). Takeminakata's portrayal in the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Kuji Hongi\" as one who suffered a humiliating defeat was apparently seen as something of an embarrassment during the Middle Ages, leading to the appearance of alternative stories which portray Suwa Myōjin's origins in a more positive light such as the Kōga Saburō legend.\n\nThe earliest documents from within (or connected to) Suwa to explicitly call Suwa Myōjin 'Takeminakata' or identify him with the god from Izumo are the \"Monoimi no rei\" (1238) - which refers in passing to Suwa Myōjin's name being 'Takeminakata Myōjin' (武御名方明神) - and the \"Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba\" (1356), the latter creatively retelling the Izumo \"kuni-yuzuri\" legend as found in the \"Kuji Hongi\" by omitting any mention of Takeminakata being defeated. The \"Ekotoba\"'s popularity among a wide audience that included the priestly families of the Suwa Grand Shrine seems to have contributed to eventually cementing the identification of Suwa Myōjin with the Takeminakata of the official histories: Ōkuninushi's son who came to Suwa from Izumo.\n\nSuwa Myōjin's spouse is the goddess , most often considered to be the deity of the Lower Shrine of Suwa or the \"Shimosha\". Unlike the relatively well-documented Suwa \"Kamisha\", very little concrete information is available regarding the origins of the \"Shimosha\" and its goddess.\n\nYasakatome's first historical attestation is in the \"Shoku Nihon Kōki\", where the goddess is given the rank of junior fifth, lower grade (従五位下) by the imperial court in the tenth month of Jōwa 9 (842 CE), five months after the same rank was conferred on Takeminakata. As Takeminakata rose up in rank, so did Yasakatome, so that by 867 CE, Yasakatome had been promoted to senior second (正二位). The goddess was finally promoted to senior first rank (正一位) in 1074 (Jōhō 1).\n\nStories and claims about the goddess are diverse and contradictory. Regarding her parentage for instance, the lore of Kawaai Shrine (川会神社) in Kitaazumi District identifies Yasakatome as the daughter of Watatsumi, god of the sea,\nwhich has been seen as hinting to a connection between the goddess and the seafaring Azumi clan (). Another claim originating from sources dating from the Edo period is that Yasakatome was the daughter of Ame-no-yasakahiko (天八坂彦命), a god recorded in the \"Kuji Hongi\" as one of the companions of Nigihayahi-no-Mikoto when the latter came down from heaven.\n\nThe ice cracks that appear on Lake Suwa during cold winters, the \"omiwatari\" (see above) are reputed in folklore to be caused by Suwa Myōjin's crossing the frozen lake to visit Yasakatome.\n\nThe Kōga Saburō legend identifies the goddess of the Shimosha with Saburō's wife, whose name is given in some variants of the story as 'Princess Kasuga' (春日姫 \"Kasuga-hime\").\n\nIn Suwa, a number of local deities are popularly considered to be the children of Suwa Myōjin and his consort. Ōta (1926) lists the following gods:\n\nThe Suwa clan who once occupied the position of head priest or \"ōhōri\" of the Suwa \"Kamisha\" traditionally considered themselves to be descendants of Suwa Myōjin/Takeminakata, although historically they are probably descended from the Kanasashi-no-toneri clan appointed by the Yamato court to govern the Suwa area in the 6th century (see above).\n\nThe Suwa \"ōhōri\" was assisted by five priests, some of whom were also considered to be descendants of local deities related to Suwa Myōjin/Takeminakata. One clan, the Koide (小出氏), the original occupants of the offices of \"negi-dayū\" (禰宜大夫) and \"gi-no-hōri\" (擬祝), claimed descent from the god Yakine. A second clan, the Yajima (八島(嶋)氏 or 矢島氏), which served as \"gon-no-hōri\" (権祝), considered the god Ikeno'o to be their ancestor.\n\nAs the gods of the Grand Shrine of Suwa, Suwa Myōjin/Takeminakata and Yasakatome also serve as the deities of shrines belonging to the Suwa shrine network (諏訪神社 \"Suwa-jinja\") all over Japan.\n\nThe \"Nihon Shoki\"'s record of Yamato emissaries worshipping the god of Suwa alongside the gods of Tatsuta Shrine - worshipped for their power to control and ward off wind-related disasters such as droughts and typhoons - implies that the Yamato imperial court recognized the deity as a god of wind and water during the late 7th century. One theory regarding the origin of the name '(Take)minakata' even supposes it to derive from a word denoting a body of water (水潟 \"minakata\"; see above).\n\nSnake-shaped iron sickle blades called \"nagikama\" (薙鎌) were traditionally used in the Suwa region to ward off strong winds, typhoons and other natural disasters; it was once customary for \"nagikama\" to be attached to wooden staves and placed on one corner of the rooftop of the house during the autumn typhoon season. \"Nagikama\" are also traditionally hammered onto the trees chosen to become the \"onbashira\" of the Suwa \"Kamisha\" and \"Shimosha\" some time before these are actually felled. In addition to these and other uses, the blades are also distributed to function as \"shintai\" for branch shrines of the Suwa shrine network.\n\nSuwa Myōjin's association with the snake or the dragon in many stories featuring the god such as the Kōga Saburō legend (see 'Legends of Suwa Myōjin' above) might be related to his being considered as a deity presiding over wind and water, due to the association of dragons with winds and the rain in Japanese belief. (See also \"mizuchi\".)\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, under the then-prevalent synthesis of Buddhism and Shinto, Suwa Myōjin was identified with the bodhisattva Samantabhadra (Fugen), with the goddess of the \"Shimosha\" being associated with the thousand-armed form of the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara (Senju Kannon). During the medieval period, Buddhist temples and other edifices were erected on the precincts of both shrines, including a stone pagoda called the \"Tettō\" (鉄塔 \"iron tower\") - symbolizing the legendary iron tower in India where, according to Shingon tradition, Nagarjuna was said to have received esoteric teachings from Vajrasattva (who is sometimes identified with Samantabhadra) - and a sanctuary to Samantabhadra (普賢堂 \"Fugendō\"), both of which served at the time as the \"Kamisha\"'s main objects of worship.\n\nWith the establishment of State Shinto after the Meiji Restoration in 1868 and the subsequent separation of Buddhism and Shinto, the shrine monks (\"shasō\") attached to Buddhist temples in the Suwa shrine complex were laicized, with Buddhist symbols and structures being either removed or destroyed; Buddhist ceremonies performed in both the \"Kamisha\" and the \"Shimosha\", such as the yearly offering of the Lotus Sutra to Suwa Myōjin (involving the placing of a copy of the sutra inside the \"Tettō\"), were discontinued.\n\nSuwa Myōjin is also worshipped as a god of hunting; not surprisingly, some of the \"Kamisha\"'s religious ceremonies traditionally involve(d) ritual hunting and/or animal sacrifice.\n\nFor instance, the Frog Hunting Ritual (蛙狩神事 \"kawazugari shinji\") held every New Year's Day involves the shooting (or rather, piercing) of frogs captured from a sacred river or stream within the \"Kamisha\"'s precincts with miniature arrows. This ritual - which has come under harsh criticism from local activists and animal rights groups for its perceived cruelty to the frogs involved - was traditionally performed to secure peace and a bountiful harvest for the coming year.\n\nAnother festival, the \"Ontōsai\" (御頭祭) or the \"Tori no matsuri\" (酉の祭, so called because it was formerly held on the Day of the Rooster) currently held every April 15, feature the offering of seventy-five stuffed deer heads (a substitute for freshly cut heads of deer used in the past), as well as the consumption of venison and other game such as wild boar or rabbit, various kinds of seafood and other foodstuffs by the priests and other participants in a ritual banquet.\n\nOne of the Suwa \"Kamisha\"'s hunting festivals, the Misayama Festival (御射山祭), formerly held in a field - the \"kōya\" (神野 'the god's plain') - at the foot of the Yatsugatake Mountains for five days (from the 26th to the 30th of the seventh month), was one of the grandest festivals in Suwa during the Kamakura period, attracting many of the samurai class from all across Japan who engaged in displays of mounted archery, bouts of sumo wrestling and falconry as part of the festivities, as well as people from all walks of life. The \"Shimosha\" also held its own Misayama Festival at the same time as the \"Kamisha\" (albeit in a different location), in which various warrior clans also participated.\n\nSuwa Myōjin's association with the mountains and hunting is also evident from the description of the \"ōhōri\" as sitting upon a deer hide (the deer being an animal thought to be sacred to Suwa Myōjin) during the \"Ontōsai\" ritual as practiced during medieval times.\n\nAt a time when slaughter of animals and consumption of meat was frowned upon due to Mahayana Buddhism's strict views on vegetarianism and the general Buddhist opposition against the taking of life, the cult of Suwa Myōjin was a unique feature in the Japanese religious landscape for its celebration of hunting and meat eating.\n\nA four-line verse attached to the Kōga Saburō legend popularly known as the \"Suwa no kanmon\" (諏訪の勘文) encapsulates the justification of meat eating within a Buddhist framework: by being eaten by humans and 'dwelling' inside their bodies, ignorant animals could achieve enlightenment together with their human consumers.\n\nThe \"Kamisha\" produced special talismans (鹿食免 \"kajiki-men\" \"permit to eat venison\") and chopsticks (鹿食箸 \"kajiki-bashi\") that were held to allow the bearer to eat meat. Since it was the only one of its kind in Japan, the talisman was popular among hunters and meat eaters. These sacred licenses and chopsticks were distributed to the public both by the priests of the \"Kamisha\" as well as wandering preachers associated with the shrine known as \"oshi\" (御師), who preached the tale of Suwa Myōjin as Kōga Saburō as well as other stories concerning the god and his benefits.\n\nSuwa Myōjin is also considered to be a god of war, one of a number of such deities in the Japanese pantheon. Besides the legend of the god's apparition to Sakanoue no Tamuramaro (see above), the \"Ryōjin Hishō\" compiled in 1179 (the late Heian period) also attest to the worship of the god of Suwa in the capacity of god of warfare at the time of its compilation, naming the shrine of Suwa among famous shrines to martial deities in the eastern half of the country.\n\nDuring the Kamakura period, the Suwa clan's association with the shogunate and the Hōjō clan helped further cement Suwa Myōjin's reputation as a martial deity. The shrines of Suwa and the priestly clans thereof flourished under the patronage of the Hōjō, which promoted devotion to the god as a sign of loyalty to the shogunate. Suwa branch shrines became numerous all across Japan, especially in territories held by clans devoted to the god (for instance, the Kantō region, traditional stronghold of the Minamoto (Seiwa Genji) clan).\n\nThe Takeda clan of Kai Province (modern Yamanashi Prefecture) were devotees of Suwa Myōjin, its most famous member, the Sengoku \"daimyō\" Takeda Shingen being no exception. His devotion is visibly evident in some of his war banners, which bore the god's name and invocations such as \"Namu Suwa Nangū Hosshō Kamishimo Daimyōjin\" (南無諏方南宮法性上下大明神 'Namo Dharma-Nature \"Daimyōjin\" of the Suwa Upper and Lower Shrines'). The iconic horned helmet with the flowing white hair commonly associated with Shingen, popularly known as the \"Suwa-hosshō\" helmet (諏訪法性兜 \"Suwa-hosshō-(no)-kabuto\"), came to be reputed in some popular culture retellings to have been blessed by the god, guaranteeing success in battle to its wearer. Shingen also issued an order for the reinstitution of the religious rites of both the \"Kamisha\" and the \"Shimosha\" in 1565.\n\n\n\n"}

Geddes was a central character in Maxwell's \"Harpoon at a Venture\" (1952), an account of their failed shark oil extraction venture on Soay and also featured in Ian Mitchell's \"Isles of the West\" (1999).\n\nGeddes was born in Scotland in 1919 and claimed to have been raised by his father in Canada. He was said to have worked as a lumber camp monkey boy sawing tree tops and as a rum runner in the North Atlantic before returning to Britain during World War II, although some details are disputed. Geddes was a special forces instructor alongside Gavin Maxwell in Arisaig during the war, where as a sergeant in the Seaforth Highlanders he specialised in amphibious warfare.\nFollowing the war and his marriage to Cheltenham Ladies College-educated Jeanne, Geddes served on the Mallaig lifeboat. He joined Gavin Maxwell's basking shark oil extraction venture in the late 1940s, harpooning basking sharks in the Minch from the Traveller, the remains of which boat are still visible in Soay Harbour.\nAfter Maxwell's business venture failed and he abandoned the island, Geddes and his wife purchased Soay in 1952. Geddes continued fishing basking sharks, selling unprocessed livers rather than processed oil to Glasgow. While much of the remaining population of the island evacuated to Mull in 1953, Geddes and his family remained. Geddes protested at the lack of emergency telephone services and with the threat of loss of postal service to the remaining inhabitants of the island, he asked people to send him registered letters and packages. As a result the service was kept with post arriving once a month.\nHistorian of Gaelic culture Margaret Fay Shaw said of him: \"Tex was a great storyteller and important as such. He was also immensely kind, and had that hunger for life and fun that is essential if you are to make a go of living in these islands. The Hebrides needs more people like Tex Geddes. So does the world.\"\n\nGeddes died during a return journey from a bagpiping competition in the Outer Hebrides. A memorial to Tex and his wife is placed at a stone bench on the trail pass over the middle of Soay.\n"}

{"id": "2044626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044626", "title": "The Future Is Wild", "text": "The Future Is Wild\n\nThe Future Is Wild is a British 2002 thirteen-part pseudo-documentary television miniseries. Based on research and interviews with several scientists, the miniseries shows how life could evolve in the future if humans were to disappear from the Earth altogether through extinction. The version broadcast on the Discovery Channel modified this premise, supposing instead that the human species had completely abandoned the Earth and had sent back probes to examine the progress of life on the planet as time progressed. The show styled itself after the format of a nature documentary. It is narrated by John de Lancie in the Discovery Channel version.\n\nThe miniseries was released with a companion book written by geologist Dougal Dixon, the author of several speculative evolution books, or \"anthropologies and zoologies of the future\" (such as \"\"), in conjunction with natural history television producer John Adams. For a time in 2005, a theme park based on this program was opened in Japan. In 2008 a special on the Discovery Channel about the development of the video game \"Spore\" was combined with airings of \"The Future Is Wild\".\n\nA documentary film version of the series was originally set to be picked up by Warner Bros., however, the series may be rebooted by production company Vanguard Animation and broadcasting at HBO.\n\nThe 2-part 2005 series \"Extraterrestrial\" (also known as \"Alien Worlds\") takes a similar scientific approach to the creation of speculative ecologies and the depiction of their inhabitants. As the title suggests, however, these are set on extrasolar planets with no connection to terrestrial evolution.\n\nTwelve ecosystems were presented, four in each of the three future periods.\n\nThe early episodes describe a world after an ice age, when giant sea-birds roam the beaches and carnivorous bats rule the skies. Ice sheets extend as far south as Paris in the northern hemisphere and as far north as Buenos Aires in the southern hemisphere. The Amazon rainforest has dried up and become grassland. The North American plains have become cold desert, and Africa has collided with Europe, enclosing the Mediterranean Sea. Without water to replace it in the dry climate, the Mediterranean has dried out into a salt flat dotted with brine lakes, as it has been in the past. Most of Europe is frozen tundra. The part of Africa east of the African Rift Valley has broken away from the rest of the continent. Asia has dried up and is now mountainous. The once warm, tropical area of Central America has been transformed into a dry area. Australia has moved north and collided with eastern Indonesia.\n\n\n\n\nIn the scenario for 100 million years in the future, the world is much hotter than at present. Octopuses and enormous tortoises have come on to the land, much of which is flooded by shallow seas surrounded by brackish swamps. Antarctica has drifted towards the tropics and is covered with dense rainforests, as it was before. Australia has collided with North America and Asia, forcing up an enormous, 12-kilometre-high mountain plateau much taller than the modern Himalayas. Greenland has been reduced to a small, temperate island. There are cold, deep ocean trenches. The Sahara has once again become the rich grassland it was millions of years ago\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hypothetical world of 200 million years from now is recovering from a mass extinction caused by a flood basalt eruption even larger than the one that created the Siberian Traps, wiping out 99% of the species on the planet. Fish have taken to the skies, squid to the forests, and the world's largest-ever desert is filled with strange worms and insects. All the continents have collided with one another and fused into a single supercontinent, a second Pangaea. (A few present-day geographical features can still be discerned, including Hudson Bay, Novaya Zemlya and the Scandinavian Peninsula, as well as the general outline of Africa.) One large global ocean with a single-current system gives rise to deadly hurricanes called hypercanes, which batter the coastlines of the continent all year long. The northwestern side of Pangaea II, drenched with an endless supply of rain, has become a temperate forest. Mountains resting at the end of the coast prevent most of the rain's moisture from reaching a long line of scrubby rainshadow deserts. The very center of the continent receives no rain at all and has become a barren, plantless desert. Only fish, arthropods, worms and mollusks were left to repopulate the Earth.\n\n\n\nEach episode generally focuses on just one food chain within a particular ecosystem.\n\n\"The Future is Wild\" is a £5-million co-production of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the Franco-German channel Arte, the German ZDF, the Austrian ORF, the Italian Mediaset, and Animal Planet and Discovery Channels Inc of the United States.\n\nThe BBC intended that the miniseries would repeat the success it had with its prehistoric documentary series \"Walking With Dinosaurs\", which attracted 17 million viewers in 1999. The program used computer-generated imagery to show the possible future of life on Earth. The 13-part series was produced in four years by independent producer John Adams, who conceived it in 1997.\n\nScientists involved in the project include the following:\n\n\"The Future is Wild\" doubled the previous ratings record for the Animal Planet channel when it was aired in the United States. The series was shown on BBC2 in late 2004.\n\nZDF Enterprises sold the television rights of the series to 18 markets: Belgium, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Ecuador, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Middle East, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia and Venezuela.\n\nThe series was released on three DVDs: episodes 1–5, episodes 6–9 and episodes 10–13. The three DVDs have also been released together as a set. Both the single DVDs and the three-DVD set are available for DVD regions one and two. Although the singles are available for region four, the three-DVD set is not. In addition to the complete edition, there is also an abridged region 2 3-disc version which condenses each of the three time periods into one 52-minute episode.\n\nAn educational CD-ROM entitled \"The Future Is Wild\" was produced by Sherston Software in 2006. It is designed to fit in with international school curricula for science, mathematics, geography and history.\n\nA book version was released in 2003, published by Firefly Books.\n\nIn 2008-2012 Futuroscope theme park in Poitiers, France contained an exhibit dedicated to the movie, its animals and habitats.\n\nSince 2016 Dinosaurier Park Teufelsschlucht in Ernzen has displayed multiple animals from the series. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4041766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4041766", "title": "Transpartisan", "text": "Transpartisan\n\nTranspartisanship represents an emerging school of political thought which accepts the validity of truths across a range of political perspectives and seeks to synthesize them into an inclusive, pragmatic container beyond typical political dualities. It is distinct from bipartisanship, which aims to negotiate between “right” and “left,” resulting in a dualistic perspective, and nonpartisanship, which tends to avoid political affiliation altogether.\n\nTranspartisanship is a movement to support and advance a common ground - or \"new center\" - that already exists in U.S. politics, emerging periodically into public view in the form of \"unusual coalitions\" of progressives and conservatives around issues ranging from war and the military budget to corporate power and the surveillance state.\n\nThe movement builds on methods of facilitated dialogue, deliberation and conflict resolution.\n\nCurrent examples of transpartisan initiatives include Transpartisan Center, TheSolution.org, Reuniting America, Transpartisan Alliance, and Liberty Coalition.\n\n\nTranspartisan gatherings have resulted not only in surprisingly civil conversations noted by mainstream media but also in shifts from traditional ideological stances by some participants.\n\nA close relative of transpartisanship is Integral politics. A transpartisan approach to policy would necessarily include individual and collective, as well as subjective and objective, perspective. Furthermore, similar to Integral theory, transpartisanship places politics in a developmental context, viewing democracy and prosperity not as static attainments, but rather emergent properties along a continuum of developmental stages.\n\nIn 2016, Emmanuel Macron created a new French political party, En Marche. The party sought to transcend traditional political boundaries to be a transpartisan organisation.\n\nMacron has described the party as being a progressive party uniting the left and the right. Observers and political commentators have described the party as being both socially and economically liberal in ideology, Emmanuel Macron became the President of France. The party also won the National Assembly elections a month later, as candidates in the legislative elections included members of the Democratic Movement, as well as dissidents from the Socialist Party, The Republicans and minor parties. It won an absolute majority of seats in the National Assembly, securing 308 under its label and 42 for the MoDem.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2736725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2736725", "title": "Tulipwood", "text": "Tulipwood\n\nMost commonly, tulipwood is the pinkish yellowish wood yielded from the tulip tree, found on the Eastern side of North America and also in some parts of China. In the United States, it is commonly known as tulip poplar or yellow poplar, even though the tree is not related to the poplars. In fact, the reference to poplar is a result of the tree's height, which can exceed 100 feet. The wood is very light, around 490 kg per cubic meter, but very strong and is used in many applications, including furniture, joinery and moldings. It can also be stained very easily and is often used as a low-cost alternative to walnut and cherry in furniture and doors.\n\nBrazilian tulipwood is a different species. A classic high-quality wood, it is very dense with a lovely figure. It is used for inlays in furniture and for small turned items. Available only in small sizes, it is rarely used in the solid for luxury furniture. Like other woods with a pronounced figure it is rather strongly subject to fashion.\n\nIn the nineteenth century Brazilian tulipwood was thought to be the product of the brazilian rosewood \"Physocalymma scaberrimum\" (West indian tulipwood), but in the twentieth century it became clear it was yielded by a species of \"Dalbergia\". At some point it was misidentified as \"Dalbergia frutescens\", a misidentification which can still be found in books aimed at the woodworker. For some decades it has been known to be yielded by \"Dalbergia decipularis\", a species restricted to a small area in Western-Brazil. But both \"Dalbergia fructescens\" and \"Dalbergia decipularis\" are named (Brazilian tulipwood). Also \"Dalbergia cearensis\" kingwood or violetwood, is named tulipwood and \"Dalbergia oliveri\" the burmese rosewood is sometimes called \"burma tulipwood\".\n\nThe cheap, soft and pale wood from the tuliptree \"Liriodendron tulipifera\" is know as american tulipwood or poplar and american whitewood, canary whitewood and canary wood, it is widely used.\n\nThere also exists the \"australian tulipwood\", \"tulipwood trees\" the common name of \"Harpullia\", \"Harpullia pendula\" (Black or Queensland, Moreton Bay tulipwood) and \"Harpullia arborea\" (Cooktown tulipwood) or \"Harpullia hillii\" (Blunt leaf tulipwood) and \"Harpullia alata\" (Wing-leaved tulipwood) etc. Certain varieties of \"Harpullia\" were prized for their dark coloured timber. The one most commonly known to horticulture is \"Harpullia pendula\" which is widely planted as a street tree along the east coast of Australia. Also \"Drypetes acuminata\" and \"Drypetes deplanchei\" (Yellow tulipwood) are from Australia.\n\nAlso exists the tuliptrees, \"Thespesia populnea\" and \"Thespesia acutiloba\", \"Spathodea campanulata\", \"Stenocarpus sinuatus\", and \"Licaria guianensis\", \"Dicypellium caryophyllatum\" and \"Hibiscus elatus\", these trees resp. their wood are also occasionaly named tulipwood. \n"}
