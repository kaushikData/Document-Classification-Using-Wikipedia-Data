It is also the name of a mountain or mountain range.\n\nThe etymology of the theonym is uncertain. It has been associated with the etymon *\"abo-s\" \"water, river\", found in e.g. Avon (\"*abonā\"). The second element has been connected to either a PIE *\"nogʷo-\", either \"naked, nude\" or \"tree\", or with the verbal root *\"nebh-\" \"burst out, be damp\".\n\nAbnoba has been interpreted to be a forest and river goddess, and is known from about nine epigraphic inscriptions. One altar at the Roman baths at Badenweiler, Germany, and another at identify her with Diana, the Roman goddess of the hunt.\n\nAbnoba, sometimes spelt Arnoba or Arbona, has been used to refer to a mountain range comprising the Odenwald, Spessart, and Baar mountains. This composite range extends from the Rhine to the Neckar, and is referred to by one of the various names listed depending on the region it is passing through.\n\nAccording to Tacitus's \"Germania\", Abnoba was the name of a mountain, from a grassy slope of which flows the source of the River Danube.\nPliny the Elder also gives us some statements about Abnoba (\"Natural History\", 4.79). He says that it arises opposite the town of Rauricum in Gaul and flows from there beyond the Alps, implying that the river begins in the Alps, which it does not. If Rauricum is to be identified with the Roman settlement, Augusta Raurica, modern Augst in Basel-Landschaft canton of Switzerland, Pliny must be confusing the Rhine and its tributaries with the Danube.\n\nThe Danube begins with two small rivers draining the Black Forest: the Breg and the Brigach, both Celtic names. The longest is the most favorable candidate: the Breg. The Abnobaei montes would therefore be the Baar foothills of the Swabian Alb near Furtwangen im Schwarzwald.\n\nPtolemy's \"Geography\" (2.10) also mentions the mountain range, but incorrectly implies a position north of the Agri Decumates and Main river. It has been suggested that this error comes about through the use of differing and imperfect sources to make this section of the Geography. In effect Ptolemy has apparently confused the Abnoba with the Roman border, and therefore with what are today called the Taunus mountains.\n\n"}

A first proposal was a section near Duibian, Zhejiang province (China). Note recent publications favor Steamboat Pass in the House Range of Utah.

Other scales define a cobble's size in slightly different terms. A rock made predominantly of cobbles is termed a conglomerate. Cobblestone is a building material based on cobbles.\n\nCobbles, also called cobblestones, derive their name from the word cob, meaning a rounded lump. The term is further related to the German \"\", meaning \"head\". Chester Wentworth referred to cobbles as \"cobble bowlders\" in his 1922 paper that would become the basis for the Udden–Wentworth scale.\n\nWithin the widely used Krumbein phi scale of grain sizes, cobbles are defined as clasts of rock ranging from −6 to −8 φ. This classification corresponds with the Udden–Wentworth size scale which defines cobbles as clasts with diameters from . On this scale, cobbles are larger than pebbles which measure in diameter and smaller than boulders, whose diameters range from . On the Udden–Wentworth scale, an unlithified fraction of cobbles is classified as gravel while a lithified sample primarily composed of cobbles is a conglomerate. The Committee on Sedimentation of the US National Research Council has recommended that in situ cobbles be identified by their process of origination, if possible (e.g. \"cobbles by disintegration\", \"by exfoliation\", etc.). \n\nIn the late 1800s and early to mid-1900s, prior to the Udden–Wentworth scale's widespread adoption, size classifications tended to group all particles larger than together as \"gravel\" or \"stones\". Other scales have defined the size of a cobble slightly differently than the Udden–Wentworth; the British Standards Institution denotes a cobble as any clast ranging in diameter from while the United States Department of Agriculture's definition suggests a range of and the ISO standard names cobbles as ranging from in diameter.\n\nVarious attempts have been made to refine the Udden–Wentworth scale, including its definition of cobbles. In 1968, D. J. Doeglas proposed subdividing the \"cobble\" designation into two fractions, \"small cobbles\" (for particles with diameters from ) and \"large cobbles\" (for particles with diameters from ). A 1999 paper by Terence C. Blair and John G. McPherson argued that the Udden–Wentworth and Krumbein scales betrayed a historical emphasis on the study of sand grains while ignoring larger gravel grains. They proposed defining \"fine cobbles\" as those with diameters from (−6 to −7 φ) and \"coarse cobbles\" as those with diameters from (−7 to −8 φ). In 2012, Simon J. Blott and Kenneth Pye suggested that the cobble designation be eliminated altogether, replaced by \"very small boulder\" and \"small boulder\" designations equivalent in size to Blair and McPherson's fine and coarse cobbles, respectively.\n\nWhen occurring in streams, cobbles are likely to be found in mountain valley streambeds that are moderately steep. Cobbles are also transported by glaciers and deposited as with other grades of sediment as till. If the till is water-laid, finer particles like sand and pebbles may be entirely washed away, leaving a deposit of only boulders and cobbles. Glacially transported cobbles tend to share several identifying features including a tabular shape and downward diagonal striations on lateral facets.\n\nCobble conglomerates may be alluvial in origin or the product of \"stone avalanches\", a type of debris flow resulting from unconsolidated cobbles and gravel. In such stone avalanches, well-rounded cobbles may travel the farthest on account of their low rolling friction. When the product of alluvial processes, the cobble conglomerate's matrix consists of gravel and coarse sand. In contrast, the matrices of flow-deposited conglomerates are primarily mud.\n\n"}

The goddesses Tocih “our grandmother”, and Cihuacoatl “snake woman”, the patron of women who die in childbirth, were also seen as aspects of Coatlicue.\n\nThe goddess' Classical Nahuatl name can be rendered both \"Cōātlīcue\" and \"Cōātl īcue\", from \"cōātl\" “snake” and \"īcue\" “her skirt”, roughly meaning “[she who has] the skirt of snakes”. The name \"Tēteoh īnnān\", from \"tēteoh\", plural of \"teōtl\" “god”, + \"īnnān\" “their mother”, refers directly to her maternal role as a primordial earth goddess.\n\nCoatlicue is represented as a woman wearing a skirt of writhing snakes and a necklace made of human hearts, hands, and skulls. Her feet and hands are adorned with claws and her breasts are depicted as hanging flaccid from pregnancy. Her face is formed by two facing serpents (after her head was cut off and the blood spurt forth from her neck in the form of two gigantic serpents), referring to the myth that she was sacrificed during the beginning of the present creation.\n\nMost Aztec artistic representations of Coatlicue emphasize her deadly side, because Earth, as well as loving mother, is the insatiable monster that consumes everything that lives. She represents the devouring mother, in whom both the womb and the grave exist.\n\nAccording to Aztec legend, Coatlicue was once magically impregnated by a ball of feathers that fell on her while she was sweeping a temple, and subsequently gave birth to the god Huitzilopochtli. Her daughter Coyolxauhqui then rallied Coatlicue's four hundred other children together and goaded them into attacking and decapitating their mother. The instant she was killed, the god Huitzilopochtli suddenly emerged from her womb fully grown and armed for battle. He killed many of his brothers and sisters, including Coyolxauhqui, whose head he cut off and threw into the sky to become the moon. In one variation on this legend, Huitzilopochtli himself is the child conceived in the ball-of-feathers incident and is born just in time to save his mother from harm.\n\nCecelia Klein (1999) argues that the famous Coatlicue statue in the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico, and several other complete and fragmentary versions, may actually represent a personified snake skirt. The reference is to one version of the creation of the present Sun. The myth relates that the present Sun began after the gods gathered at Teotihuacan and sacrificed themselves. The best-known version states that Tezzictecatl and Nanahuatzin immolated themselves, becoming the moon and the sun. However, other versions add a group of women to those who sacrificed themselves, including Coatlicue. Afterwards the Aztecs were said to have worshipped the skirts of these women, which came back to life. Coatlicue thus has creative aspects, which may balance the skulls, hearts, hands, and claws that connect her to the earth deity Tlaltecuhtli. The earth both consumes and regenerates life.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "179880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179880", "title": "Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables", "text": "Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables\n\nThere are a number of lines of defence against pests (that, those animals that cause damage to the plants we grow) and diseases in the orchard, principal among these being the practice of good husbandry, creating healthy soil and ensuring high standards of garden hygiene. But no matter how diverse and healthy the garden eco-system may be, there will always be a degree of disease and pest presence. In many ways, some level of pathogen population in the garden can be not only acceptable but desirable as they are indicative of a generally healthful and diverse environment, and add to the overall robustness of the system as an immunity to such detrimental influences will build up, particularly in a balanced polycultural regime. Indeed, most of the plants we grow will tend to be selected because they are trouble free, and those that are more susceptible to attack will have fallen by the wayside over time. However, most farmers find it unacceptable that the food crops they grow are damaged by pests.\n\nFor these crops there has been considerable research and selective breeding carried out in order to find cultivars that are resistant or immune to pest and disease damage. Breeding for plant disease resistance generally has involved finding suitable genetic material amongst existing stocks or in the wild, which is then incorporated into commercial varieties.\n\nIn the case of apples, in which research is being carried out in order to develop resistance to diseases such as apple scab (\"Venturia inaequalis\"), powdery mildew (\"Podosphaera leucotricha\"), orchard fireblight (\"Erwinia amylovora\"), woolly apple aphid (\"Eriosoma lanigerum\") and collar rot (\"Phytophthora cactorum\"), the main sources of resistant material used in breeding programmes such as those being run by East Malling Research Station in England or Hortresearch in New Zealand are major gene resistances derived from crab-apples. The Vf gene for black spot resistance is derived from the ornamental crab-apple species \"Malus floribunda\". Most black spot resistant cultivars developed around the world carry this gene, but there are some selections that carry the Vr (from M. pumila) or Vm (from M. micromalus) gene. Major gene resistances to powdery mildew are derived from M. robusta (Pl1) and M. zumi (Pl2), and the apple cultivar \"Northern Spy\" has a long-standing reputation for its major gene resistance to woolly apple aphid. Since early this century this resistance has been used to develop woolly aphid resistant rootstocks such as MM.106 and M.793. Much later it was shown that the cultivar was also very resistant to collar rot and a useful breeding parent for this resistance.\n\nSome plants can tolerate the presence of large numbers of insects without being severely affected. This is not very satisfactory however as insects will still cause damage, and in fact further breeding and population expansion of the pest species is supported. Other varieties are less attractive to pests, but this can be difficult to sustain or demonstrate.<br>\nThe most valuable form of resistance is where the pest cannot survive as well on one variety as on another. In some cases this can actually make the plants immune to attack, as is the case with the lettuces \"Avoncrisp\" and \"Avondefiance\" which were bred at the Institute of Horticultural Research, Wellesbourne during the 1960s, which are fully resistant to lettuce root aphid (\"Pemphigus bursarius\").\n\nSometimes however there can be a \"trade-off\", for those varieties which have increased immunity or resistance may be lacking in other qualities such as flavour, yield or quality. Celery resistant to the Fusarium fungus (\"Fusarium oxysporum spp.\") may not succumb to this disease, but may also be unacceptably short, ribby and low yielding.<br>\nFurther, a cultivar that is resistant to one disease may be more susceptible to another that is equally important. A lettuce cultivar that is resistant to mosaic virus may be sensitive to corky root disease, whilst another that resists corky root may be vulnerable to downy mildew (\"Brim lactic\").<br>\nAnother drawback to resistance is that depending on the host pathogen system, resistance is sometimes not long lasting as new pathogen strains quickly develop, and further research and breeding is constantly needed.\n\nResistant varieties are not available for all crops. For several of the most damaging plant diseases, such as Potato blight (\"Phytophthora infestans\") and white rot (\"Sclerotic cepivorum\") of the Allium family, no acceptable resistant cultivars are yet available. In addition, commercial seed companies and plant breeders rarely invest resources into developing resistant cultivars for more minor or speciality crops, which often tend to be those of greater interest to the organic grower.\n\nIn general it is probably fair to say that resistance will not fully guarantee total crop protection, but choosing resistant varieties should rather be considered as a part of an overall Integrated pest management strategy, especially against virus diseases. In particular they can be especially useful where the threat from specific pests and diseases is high.\n\nThe table below illustrates a number of pest and disease resistant vegetable crop varieties, although should not be considered comprehensive.\n\n"}

He claimed the polar axis would shift and that many areas that are now land would again become ocean floor, and that Atlantis would rise from the sea. The belief that the California coast would slip into the sea—a common feature of Earth Changes predictions—originated with Cayce's alleged prophecies. In more recent times, self-proclaimed psychic Gordon-Michael Scallion has issued a variety of prophecies centering on the concept of \"Earth Changes\" and publishes a monthly newsletter, \"The Earth Changes Report\".\n\nCayce's term has been taken up in certain segments of the New Age movement, often associated with other predictions by people claiming to have psychic abilities. Belief in Earth changes is also found among Native Americans, some of whom refer to the concept as \"the Great Purification.\" These beliefs have occasionally been associated with Christian millennialism and beliefs about UFOs. Some New Age adherents believe that Earth changes will preface a \"Golden Age\" of spirituality and world peace.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Lori Toye published the I Am America Map, based on several visions that she claimed to have beginning in 1983. The I Am America Map sold over 40,000 copies, and was followed by subsequent maps: Freedom Star World map, Golden Cities map, and an Earth Changes Progression series of maps. These maps represented the earth’s future geography after climatic earth changes.\n\nProphecies of Earth changes have been described as a form of pseudoscience, in which terminology and ideas borrowed from science are used to rationalize non-scriptural apocalyptical thought based on visionary experiences. David Spangler, a leader of the Findhorn Foundation spiritual community, described prophecies of Earth changes as an expression of collective fear and anger, rather than as foretelling of actual future events.\n\n"}

Her name is used as an eponym for a female advisor or counselor.\n\nEgeria may predate Roman myth: she could have been of Italic origin in the sacred forest of Aricia in Latium, her immemorial site, which was equally the grove of Diana Nemorensis (\"Diana of Nemi\"). At Aricia there was also a Manius Egerius, a male counterpart of Egeria.\n\nThe name \"Egeria\" has been diversely interpreted; it might mean \"of the black poplar\"; Georges Dumézil proposed it came from \"e-gerere\", suggesting it came from her childbirth role; her role as prophetess and author of \"sacred books\" would compare her to the Etruscan figure of Vegoia (alleged author among other things of \"Libri Fulgurales\", which give keys to interpreting the meaning of lightning strokes, seen as ominous messages from a variety of deities).\n\nEgeria as a nymph or minor goddess of the Roman religious system is of unclear origin; she is consistently, though not in a very clear way, associated with another figure of the Diana type; their cult is known to have been celebrated at sacred groves, such as the site of Nemi at Aricia, and another one close to Rome (see section below); both goddesses are also associated with water bearing wondrous, religious or medical properties (the source in that grove at Rome was dedicated to the exclusive use of the Vestals); their cult was associated with other, male figures of even more obscure meaning, such as one named Virbius, or a Manius Egerius, presumably a youthful male, that anyway in later years was identified with figures like Atys or Hippolyte, because of the Diana reference (see Frazer).\n\nDescribed sometime as a \"mountain nymph\" (Plutarch), she is usually regarded as a water nymph and somehow her cult also involved some link with childbirth, like the Greek goddess Ilithyia.\n\nBut most of all, Egeria gave wisdom and prophecy in return for libations of water or milk at her sacred groves. This quality has been made especially popular through the tale of her relationship with Numa Pompilius (the second legendary king of Rome, who succeeded its founder Romulus).\n\nAccording to mythology she counseled and guided the King Numa Pompilius (Latin \"numen\" designates \"the expressed will of a deity\") in the establishment of the original framework of laws and rituals of Rome. Numa is reputed to have written down the teachings of Egeria in \"sacred books\" that he had buried with him. When a chance accident brought them back to light some 500 years later, the Senate deemed them inappropriate for disclosure to the people, and ordered their destruction. What made them inappropriate was some matter of religious nature with \"political\" bearing that apparently has not been handed down by Valerius Antias, the source that Plutarch was using. Dionysius of Halicarnassus hints that they were actually kept as a very close secret by the Pontifices.\n\nShe is also gifted with oracular capabilities (she interpreted for Numa the abstruse omens of gods, for instance the episode of the omen from Faunus). In another episode she helps Numa in a battle of wits with Jupiter himself, whereby Numa sought to gain a protective ritual against lightning strokes and thunder.\n\nNuma also invoked communicating with other deities, such as Muses; hence naturally enough, the somewhat \"pale\" figure of Egeria was later categorized by the Romans as one of the Camenae, deities who came to be equated with the Greek Muses as Rome fell under the cultural influence of Greece; so Dionysius of Halicarnassus listed Egeria among the Muses.\n\nThe precise level of her relationship to Numa has been described diversely. She is typically given the respectful label \"coniuncta\" (\"consort\"); Plutarch is very evasive as of the actual mode of intimacy between Numa and Egeria, and hints that Numa himself entertained a level of ambiguity. By Juvenal's day that tradition was treated more critically. Juvenal called her Numa's \"Amica\" (or \"girlfriend\") in a sceptical phrase.\n\nNuma Pompilius died in 673 BC of old age. According to Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", with Numa's death Egeria melted into tears of sorrow, thus becoming a spring (\"...donec pietate dolentis / mota soror Phoebi gelidum de corpore fontem / fecit...\" ), traditionally identified with the one nearby Porta Capena in Rome.\n\nA spring and a grove once sacred to Egeria stand close to a gate of Rome, the Porta Capena. Its waters were dedicated to the exclusive use of the Vestals. The \"ninfeo\", a favored picnic spot for nineteenth-century Romans, can still be visited in the archaeological park of the Caffarella, between the Appian Way and the even more ancient Via Latina, nearby the Baths of Caracalla (a later construction).\n\nIn the second century, when Herodes Atticus recast an inherited villa nearby as a great landscaped estate, the natural grotto was formalized as an arched interior with an apsidal end where a statue of Egeria once stood in a niche; the surfaces were enriched with revetments of green and white marble facings and green porphyry flooring and friezes of mosaic.

It is an important oil and gas producer in the region and the world's second largest ethanol fuel producer. The government agencies responsible for energy policy are the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME), the National Council for Energy Policy (CNPE), the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) and the National Agency of Electricity (ANEEL). State-owned companies Petrobras and Eletrobrás are the major players in Brazil's energy sector, as well as Latin America's.\n\nAt the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s, Brazil's energy sector underwent market liberalization. In 1997, the Petroleum Investment Law was adopted, establishing a legal and regulatory framework, and liberalizing oil production. It created the CNPE and the ANP, increased use of natural gas, increased competition in the energy market, and increased investment in power generation. The state monopoly on oil and gas exploration ended, and energy subsidies were reduced. However, the government retained monopoly control of key energy complexes and regulated the price of certain energy products.\n\nCurrent government policies concentrate mainly on improving energy efficiency in both residential and industrial sectors, as well as increasing use of renewable energy. Further restructuring of the energy sector will be one of the key issues for ensuring sufficient energy investments to meet the rising need for fuel and electricity.\n\nBrazil is the world's 12th-largest oil producer. Up to 1997, the government-owned Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) had a monopoly on oil. More than 50 oil companies now are engaged in oil exploration. The only global oil producer is Petrobras, with an output of more than of oil equivalent per day. It is also a major distributor of oil products, and owns oil refineries and oil tankers.\n\nIn 2006, Brazil had the second-largest proven oil reserves in South America after Venezuela. The vast majority of proven reserves were located in the Campos and Santos offshore basins off the southeast coast of Brazil. In November 2007, Petrobras announced that it believed the offshore Tupi oil field had between 5 and of recoverable light oil and neighbouring fields may even contain more, which all in all could result in Brazil becoming one of the largest producers of oil in the world.\n\nBrazil has been a net exporter of oil since 2011. However, the country still imports some light oil from the Middle East, because several refineries, built in the 1960s and 1970s under the military government, are not suited to process the heavy oil in Brazilian reserves, discovered decades later.\n\nTranspetro, a wholly owned subsidiary of Petrobras, operates a crude oil transport network. The system consists of of crude oil pipelines, coastal import terminals, and inland storage facilities.\n\nAt the end of 2017, the proven reserves of Brazil's natural gas were 369 x 10 m³, with possible reserves expected to be 2 times higher . Until recently natural gas was produced as a by-product of the oil industry. The main reserves in use are located at Campos and Santos Basins. Other natural gas basins include Foz do Amazonas, Ceara e Potiguar, Pernambuco e Paraíba,\nSergipe/Alagoas, Espírito Santo and Amazonas (onshore). Petrobras controls over 90 percent of Brazil’s natural gas reserves.\n\nBrazil's inland gas pipeline systems are operated by Petrobras subsidiary Transpetro. In 2005, construction began on the Gas Unificação (Gasun pipeline) which will link Mato Grosso do Sul in southwest Brazil, to Maranhão in the northeast. China’s Sinopec is a contractor for the Gasene pipeline, which will link the northeast and southeast networks. Petrobras is also constructing the Urucu-Manaus pipeline, which will link the Urucu gas reserves to power plants in the state of Amazonas.\n\nIn 2005, the gas production was 18.7 x 10 m³, which is less than the natural gas consumption of Brazil. Gas imports come mainly from Bolivia's Rio Grande basin through the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline (Gasbol pipeline), from Argentina through the Transportadora de Gas de Mercosur pipeline (Paraná-Uruguayana pipeline), and from LNG imports. Brazil has held talks with Venezuela and Argentina about building a new pipeline system Gran Gasoducto del Sur linking the three countries; however, the plan has not moved beyond the planning stages.\n\nBrazil has total coal reserves of about 30 billion tonnes, but the deposits vary by the quality and quantity. The proved recoverable reserves are around 10 billion tonnes. In 2004 Brazil produced 5.4 million tonnes of coal, while coal consumption reached 21.9 million tonnes. Almost all of Brazil’s coal output is steam coal, of which about 85% is fired in power stations. Reserves of sub-bituminous coal are located mostly in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paraná.\n\nBrazil has the world's second largest known oil shale (the Irati shale and lacustrine deposits) resources and has second largest shale oil production after Estonia. Oil shale resources lie in São Mateus do Sul, Paraná, and in Vale do Paraíba. Brazil has developed the world’s largest surface oil shale pyrolysis retort Petrosix, operated by Petrobras. Production in 1999 was about 200,000 tonnes.\n\nBrazil has the 6th largest uranium reserves in the world. Deposits of uranium are found in eight different states of Brazil. Proven reserves are 162,000 tonnes. Cumulative production at the end of 2002 was less than 1,400 tonnes. The Poços de Caldas production centre in Minas Gerais state was shut down in 1997 and was replaced by a new plant at Lagoa Real in Bahia. There is a plan to build another production center at Itatiaia.\n\nPower sector reforms were launched in the mid-1990s and a new regulatory framework was applied in 2004. In 2004, Brazil had 86.5 GW of installed generating capacity and it produced 387 Twh of electricity. As of today 66% of distribution and 28% of power generation is owned by private companies. In 2004, 59 companies operated in power generation and 64 in electricity distribution.\n\nThe major power company is Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras (Eletrobrás), which together with its subsidiaries generates and transmits approximately 60% of Brazil's electric supply. The largest private-owned power company is Tractebel Energia. An independent system operator ( - ((ONS)), responsible for the technical coordination of electricity dispatching and the management of transmission services, and a wholesale market were created in 1998.\n\nDuring the electricity crisis in 2001 , the government launched a program to build 55 gas-fired power stations with a total capacity of 22 GW, but only 19 power stations were built, with a total capacity of 4,012 MW.\n\nBrazil is the third largest hydroelectricity producer in the world after China and Canada. In 2007 hydropower accounted for 83% of Brazilian electricity production. The gross theoretical capability exceeds 3,000 TWh per annum, of which 800 TWh per annum is economically exploitable. In 2004, Brazil produced 321TWh of hydropower.\n\nThe installed capacity is 59 GW. Brazil co-owns the Itaipu hydroelectric power plant on the Paraná River located on the border between Brazil and Paraguay, which is the world's second largest operational hydroelectric power plant with installed generation capacity of 14 GW by 20 generating units of 700 MW each.\n\nDue to Brazil's dependence on hydroelectric power and lack of investments in transmission, the reserves were being overused for several years, which led to the dams having a low level of water. Then after another bad year of rain, in June 2001, the government was forced to ration electricity usage, this ended in late 2001. Since then, due to the new rules of the sector, new power lines were built as were new power plants. While the load is even bigger than it was in 2001 the system is much safer.\n\nNuclear energy accounts for about 4% of Brazil's electricity. The nuclear power generation monopoly is owned by Eletronuclear (Eletrobrás Eletronuclear S/A), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eletrobrás. Nuclear energy is produced by two reactors at Angra. It is located at the Central Nuclear Almirante Álvaro Alberto (CNAAA) on the Praia de Itaorna in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro. It consists of two pressurized water reactors, Angra I, with capacity of 657 MW, connected to the power grid in 1982, and Angra II, with capacity of 1,350 MW, connected in 2000. A third reactor, Angra III, with a projected output of 1,350 MW, is planned to be finished by 2014 and work has been paralyzed due to environmental concerns, but the licenses are being approved and the heavy construction work will start in 2009. By 2025 Brazil plans to build seven more reactors.<br> In February 2008 President Lula da Silva signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with Argentina.\n\n according to ONS, total installed capacity of photovoltaic solar was 1.8 GW, some of the most irradiated Brazilian States are MG (\"Minas Gerais\"), BA (\"Bahia\") and GO (Goiás), which have indeed world irradiation level records. \n\nBrazil's gross wind resource potential is estimated to be about 140 GW, of which 30 GW could be effectively transformed into wind power projects. according to ONS, total installed capacity was 13.4 GW. While the world average wind production capacity factors is 24,7%, there are areas in Northern Brazil, specially in \"Bahia\" State, where we can find wind farms with average capacity factors over 60%. Indeed Brazil is the country with best average wind capacity factor. \n\nDue to its ethanol fuel production, Brazil has sometimes been described as a bio-energy superpower. Ethanol fuel is produced from sugar cane. Brazil has the largest sugar cane crop in the world, and is the largest exporter of ethanol in the world. With the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian government initiated in 1975 the Pró-Álcool program. The Pró-Álcool or \"Programa Nacional do Álcool\" (National Alcohol Program) was a nationwide program financed by the government to phase out all automobile fuels derived from fossil fuels in favour of ethanol. The program successfully reduced by 10 million the number of cars running on gasoline in Brazil, thereby reducing the country's dependence on oil imports.\n\nThe production and consumption of biodiesel is expected to reach to 2% of diesel fuel in 2008 and 5% in 2013.\n\nBrazil's peat reserves are estimated at 25 billion tonnes, the highest in South America. However, no production of peat for fuel has yet been developed. Brazil produces 65 million tonnes of fuelwood per year. The annual production of charcoal is about 6 million tonnes, used in the steel industry. The cogeneration potential of agricultural and livestock residues varies from 4 GW to 47 GW by 2025.\n\nStarting from 8 November 2011 Chevron had spill of crude oil off the southeastern coast of Brazil. 416,400 liters oil leaked in two weeks from undersea rock well in the Frade oil project 370 km off the Brazilian coast. Prosecutors in Brazil demand $10.6bn in the legal suit. Chevron's activities are suspended until the cause of the oil spill is clear.\n\nThe Munduruku indigenous group in Pará state faced problems with the authorities who wanted to build hydropower plants on the Tapajós river without their permission.\n\n"}

This satellite carries the in-orbit designation of VO-52, and is an OSCAR series satellite.\n\nIt was launched by PSLV-C6 on May 5, 2005. The main payload was an Indian Remote Sensing satellite, CARTOSAT-1 weighing . HAMSAT was placed into a polar sun synchronous orbit.\n\nIt carries two transponders, one built by William Leijenaar (Call Sign: PE1RAH), a Dutch Radio Amateur and graduate engineering student from the Higher Technical Institute at Venlo and the other by Ham enthusiasts with help from the ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation). Each transponder is recognized by its beacon. The Indian transponder has an unmodulated carrier on 145.940 MHz. The Dutch transponder is modulated with telemetry information on 145.860 MHz. Both are linear transponders offering the CW, SSB and FM modes of amateur radio communication. They operate Mode-B for U-V operation with UHF uplink and VHF downlink.\n\nThe satellite joins many previous satellites in amateur radio service; mostly launched by AMSAT.\n\nHAMSAT VO-52 failed in Space on 11 July 2014, while on its 49,675th orbit, due to the failure of on-board lithium ion batteries that have met their end of life. Although the satellite's systems and sub-systems are working normal as per the latest telemetry received, the on-board computer recurring to ‘Reset’ mode due to the failure of batteries is hindering operation. Hence, it was decided not to expect any more meaningful and reliable services from HAMSAT VO-52. On 21 July 2014, ISRO has decommissioned ‘HAMSAT-VO52′ officially.\n\nHAMSAT VO-52 was designed for one year mission life, but lasted for almost 10 years. The satellite was designed to be maintenance-free, and autonomous. It was a test-bed for many new concepts such as a Bus Management Unit (BMU), lithium-ion based power system, automatic spin rate control and spin axis orientation control (SAOC) for maintaining the Satellite attitude without ground commanding. HAMSAT was known as “OSCAR-52” among Amateur HAM operators, and was popular internationally because of its high sensitivity receiver and strong transmitter.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46638873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46638873", "title": "History of the forest in Central Europe", "text": "History of the forest in Central Europe\n\nThe history of the forest in Central Europe is characterised by thousands of years of exploitation by people. Thus a distinction needs to be made between the botanical natural history of the forest in pre- and proto-historical times - which falls mainly into the fields of natural history and Paleobotany - and the onset of the period of sedentary settlement which began at the latest in the Neolithic era in Central Europe - and thus the use of the forest by people, which is covered by the disciplines of history, archaeology cultural studies and ecology.\n\nThe term Central Europe is generally used both geographically and ecologically to describe the area that lies roughly between the North Sea, the Alps, the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea.\n\nHistorical and contemporary human activity has profoundly influenced the composition of forests in the densely populated region of Central Europe. Remaining forest in Central Europe today is not generally considered natural forest, but rather a cultural landscape created over thousands of years which consists almost exclusively of replacement communities. The oldest evidence of human and forest interaction in Central Europe is about 500 000 years ago, whenfrom some hand axes have been found. The degree of hemeroby (human influence) and the extent of the original natural state from so long ago are difficult to estimate. It is believed that during glacial times during the ongoing ice age Central Europe was largely deforested and, in the period of \"natural\" re-emergence of the forest, since the end of the last glacial period, the Würm glaciation (about 11 700 years BP), people began to play a part transforming the potential natural vegetation. Sedentary, Neolithic farmers of the Linear Pottery Culture, about 7 500 years ago, began to change the forested landscape massively.\n\nDue to feudal structures, the power over and ownership of forests was not at all clear for many centuries, which resulted in widespread overexploitation. As a result, during the period 1750-1850 forests in Central Europe had been decimated, causing a serious lack of timber. Some contemporary reports even spoke partly of desert-like landscapes at that time.\n\nDuring the late 19th and 20th centuries a huge amount of artificial reforestation was implemented.\n\nToday's forest communities in central Europe are influenced by the usefulness of the individual tree species. Apart from a few remnants of \"near-natural forest\" the vast majority of today's Central European forests are either artificial forests or whose present composition has arisen as a result of active or passive human intervention. Far and away the most common are commercial timber forests, which may be more or less near-natural, with beech and oak, spruce and pine. \"Ancient forests\" in Central Europe refer to the few remaining stands that are neither currently used for forestry nor were exploited in historical times.\n\nEven with these, certain types of human influence, for example, forest browsing, cannot be completely ruled out. The composition and dynamics of the old Central European forests must therefore be reconstructed from these relics, from forest research areas and natural forest cells after they have ceased to be used, and by comparison with forest types in similar climatic conditions that are still true virgin forests, especially the Hyrcanian Forest on the Caspian Sea.\n\nThere is almost no data on the density and the influence of megaherbivores in prehistoric times, only conjecture. According to many forest scientists and a number of hunters, perpetual forest structures, which are advantageous for the forestry industry and the ecology, cannot be established without strong hunting measures to cull the present-day herbivores, the red and roe deer ensuring a correspondingly low density of these herbivores. Excessive stocks of deer do not only harm the forest as a commodity, but also prevent the natural regeneration of the forest through selective browsing by the animals and therefore hinder its natural development.\n\nThe megaherbivore theory argues that larger densities of game should therefore be permitted, because it would create a half-open and diverse landscape. Apart from red and roe deer there are no large herds of herbivores today and they have few natural predators. In today's cultural landscape, the establishment of permanent forest is seen as an economic and ecological goal; herbivores roving over wide areas inflict economic damage and are therefore hunted. The grazing of wild megaherbivores is therefore limited, as a landscape conservation measure, to large nature reserves in which a species-rich and semi-open landscape is to be preserved and economic objectives are rated as less important.\n\n\n\nUnusual climatic extremes began to occur during the Pliocene epoch, four million years ago. In the Pleistocene epoch that followed, these fluctuations culminated in a number of extensive ice ages, which ended, in central Europe, around 12,000 years ago. (For details, see the last glacial period and climate history.)\n\nDuring these cold periods, the average temperature in Central Europe fell by up to 12 °C. The snowline in the Alps dropped by 1,200 metres to 1,400 metres. Between the Alpine glaciers and the Scandinavian ice sheet, with a thickness of up to 3,000 m, was a relatively narrow, ice-free belt.\n\nCentral Europe was unforested at this time, except for local wooded areas of steppe and tundra which were covered by frost-resistant birch and pine. The vegetation of this period is referred to as Dryas flora, after its flagship species, the mountain avens (\"Dryas octopetala\").\n\nUnlike the North American continent, whose mountain ranges are oriented in a north-south direction, the east-west running ranges in Europe blocked the retreat of forest species in the face of advancing ice sheets. This barrier led to the extinction of several species in Europe. In the early ice ages, horse chestnut (\"Aesculum hippocastanum\") and sweet gum (\"Liquidambar\") became extinct. The following cold period led to the extinction of sequoia (\"Sequoia\"), umbrella pine (\"Sciadopitys\", \" Cryptomeria \"), arborvitaes (\"Thuja\"), tulip trees (\"Liriodendron\") and Douglas fir (\"Pseudotsuga\"). Hemlock (\"Tsuga\") and hickory (\"Carya\") became extinct during the Quaternary glaciations in Central Europe.\n\nIn addition, of the numerous oak species only three were able to return to Germany and Central Europe from their refuge areas, namely the English oak (\"Quercus robur\"), sessile oak (\"Q. petraea\") and downy oak (\"Q. pubescens\"). By comparison, in North America there are over 80 species of oak. Other types lost considerably in their intraspecific genetic diversity during the return migration such as the white fir (\"Abies alba\").\n\nForest flora was pushed back slowly by climatic change. The refuges of the last ice age were probably but not exclusively in southern Europe. A few species on today's Atlantic coast between England and France could also have survived the cold spell of the forest steppes. Another area of retreat was east and southeast Europe. Unlike much of Scandinavia and Russia, the Carpathians remained ice-free. So some species were also able to survive here. But the classic refuge remained the Mediterranean region, where the sea made for a balanced climate and highly rugged mountain ranges partitioned different residual populations.\n\nIn the interglacials those species that had survived extinction gradually repopulated the region. These return migrations took place at different rates for different tree species. The determining factors for the speed with which tree species repopulated the clear areas, were e. g. the method of seed distribution, the duration of flowering, degree of frost resistance and their ability to absorb nutrients. The picture of these migrations can be reconstructed using pollen analysis.\n\nFirst to advance were woody pioneer species that were quick to spread, such as birch and pine. They were followed by heat-loving species such as oak and elm. Finally they were followed by slower migrating woody species that evolved into a climax community (see cyclic succession). With the end of the interglacial period and the onset of cooler climates, these species then retreated to their refuges again or simply died out.\n\nIn the most recent section of the Quaternary period, the Holocene or postglacial epoch, the forests began to return, about 11 700 years ago, to the treeless, post-glacial steppes. Pollen analysis has largely clarified how this return migration happened. For Central Europe, there were ten phases as a rule (according to Franz Firbas), which are called pollen zones and given Roman numerals as part of the Blytt-Sernander sequence.\n\nMore recent works are increasingly often using their own pollen zone systems in order to better reflect local circumstances. The process of reforestation is fairly broadly consistent, but there are some regional differences due to local circumstances which are not discussed here in detail. Due to the migration rate (which for beech was about 260 metres/year) there is a temporal delay in the various phases from south to north.\n\nThis covers pollen zones I-III (approx 12,400 to the 9,500 BC) and roughly corresponds to the period of the late Paleolithic. Pioneer species in the early postglacial (Holocene) included various species of willow (\"Salix\"), but birch (\"Betula\") and pine (\"Pinus\") also gained a foothold again in Central Europe. Short-term fluctuations in temperature at the end of this phase stopped any further advancement of the forest.\n\nIn the Preboreal stage, corresponding to the beginning of the Mesolithic, birch and pine were the dominant species. From this time there were no more cold periods. Hazel (\"Corylus\") spread rapidly and found favourable growing conditions beneath the open stands of pine.\n\nAt the end of the Middle Stone Age, average temperatures rose markedly. Phytosociologically this was the start of the Atlantic period. Previous tree species were displaced, especially by oak (\"Quercus\") and elm (\"Ulmus\"). Most of these species were demanding, particularly in terms of their need for nutrients and warmth. The less shade-tolerant pine, in particular, was forced onto poorer sandy sites and moors. The oak, accompanied by the elm and lime, now formed the most predominant stands in Central Europe, the mixed oak forest.\n\nIn this time, people went through the transition from a nomadic wandering people to the sedentary lifestyle of the Neolithic. The great houses of the Linear Pottery Culture already placed a high demand for wood on local forests which were still small and a few in number. No later than the Neolithic, the forest was being deliberately managed to produce logs.\n\nDuring the Neolithic period more heat-loving deciduous shrubs spread out from their refuges in southern Europe back to Central Europe. Maple (\"Acer\") and ash (\"Fraxinus\") enriched existing stocks. The average temperatures were now 2-3 °C higher than today. The downy oak (\"Quercus pubescens\") returned to Germany again. Alder (\"Alnus glutinosa\") carrs arose in the marshy lowlands and spruce (\"Picea abies\") reached the Harz Mountains.\n\nIn the late interglacial the climated became cooler and wetter. For the first time since the last ice age beech (\"Fagus sylvatica\"), hornbeam (\"Carpinus betulus\") and silver fir (\"Abies alba\") are evident again.\n\nDuring the Bronze Age the average temperature fell further. Beech trees advanced into the hitherto oak-dominated woods. During the Iron Age, from 1000 B. C. beech trees were threatening the oak population in almost all areas. Aided by the humid, maritime climate of Central Europe and an ability, even in old age, to add to its habitat, the beech (with its high crown plasticity) became the dominant tree species. On the drier sites (precipitation < 500 mm/yr) in the east the hornbeam assumed this role.\n\nIn the Central Uplands a mixed mountain forest developed as beech invaded it. The extremely shade-tolerant fir also succeeded in gaining a foothold in these forests and in several areas ousted the spruce and beech. It is possible that at this time the establishment of potential natural vegetation came to an however as people settled across Central Europe and large herds of herbivores were roaming around.\n\nAs a result of falling average temperatures the distribution areas, e.g. of the downy oak, became divided. From now on the influence of settled human forms of settlement becomes increasingly noticeable. This gives us our modern which is controlled by altitudinal zonation.\n\nThe first intensive use of forests began in the Celtic period with the expansion of agriculture and the smelting of metals. This increased during the Roman-Germanic period especially in the densely populated southwestern areas.\n\nPublius Cornelius Tacitus described \"Free Germania\" (Germania magna) in the 1st century as \"terra aut silvis horrida aut paludibus foeda\" – a land, covered by horrid forests or loathsome bogs. Tacitus' Mediterranean homeland at that time had already been a cultural landscape for centuries, its forests cleared for fields, orchards and towns, to say nothing of the use of wood for home fires and maritime construction.\n\nA land whose surface was probably 70% covered by forest and climatically different clearly impressed Roman observers. This impression can be seen in the names they gave it. Mountain ranges like the Black Forest were called \"Silva Abnoba\", not \"Mons Abnoba\". It may thus be deduced that at that time trackless low mountain ranges were still largely spared from human influence. But even on the plains there were still great, contiguous areas of forest. These were located especially between the settlement areas of the various Germanic tribes and were respected on both sides as a boundary.\n\nSettlement areas included riparian forests and woods on rich soils. Initial incursions were made in order to build the settlements themselves. Next woods were cleared for farming and grazing. Timber felling for heating led to the further thinning of natural stands of trees around the settlements. Various forms of use, such as wood pasture, favoured mast-bearing trees like oaks (\"Quercus\") and beech (\"Fagus\"). In the vicinity of ore mining beech trees were probably felled over a wide area because fire from beech charcoal was needed to work metals.\n\nPermanent towns and villages were, however, a rarity in Free Germania. Settlements would be abandoned after a period of time and biological succession set in. This enabled a return of vegetation to something resembling its natural state.\n\nThe forest in Roman-occupied Germania (the Roman provinces of Germania Superior and Inferior) was more intensively used than in the unoccupied area. The construction of towns, such as Mainz, Trier, Cologne and Xanten, needed appropriate quantities of timber. A continual supply of large stocks of timber was needed for household heating and the operation of Roman baths with their extensive under-floor heating and hot water basins.\n\nAfter the conquest of all Germania had failed (due to the defeat of Varus in 9 AD) the Romans switched to a defensive strategy. This, too, demanded large quantities of timber. The construction of the \"limes\", over 500 kilometres long, which was predominantly a wooden rather than a stone redoubt, required a wide swathe to be cut through the forest from the Rhine to the Danube and wood was needed for construction of palisades and watchtowers.\n\nThe Roman engineers were careful, as far as possible, to follow the shape of the terrain with the \"limes\" and to inclose fertile soils. For example, the fertile Wetterau, opposite the Mainz was within the \"limes\"; the poor, pine-covered keuper soils south of the Odenwald were left beyond it however. Much of the beech and oak stock on nutrient-rich soil had to give way to agricultural fields and pasture land. At several places grassy and dwarf shrub heathlands emerged that have survived to the present day. The Romans also kept away from the plains with their unpredictable rivers. The alder (\"Alnus glutinosa\") carrs away from the rivers, however, were turned into grazing land.\n\nIn selecting sites for their settlements, the Romans also avoided dense coniferous forests, although mixed forest areas may still have been attractive. They prized softwood, however, especially that of silver fir (\"Abies alba\"), for construction and shipbuilding. Pine was felled in all accessible locations and transported over long distances (by rafting). Thus, the natural mountain forest in parts of the Alps, the Black Forest and the Vosges was divided.\n\nThe Romans brought familiar species of tree with them to Germania from the Mediterranean region; these included sweet chestnut (\"Castanea sativa\"), horse chestnut (\"Aesculus hippocastanum\") and walnut (\"Juglans regia\"). These species had died out in North Europe during the ice age. The trees were valued for their fruit. In addition, the robust timber of sweet chestnuts was used in wine growing.\n\nThe Romans gradually gave way to growing pressure from the Germanic tribes. First, settlements on the right bank of the Rhine were abandoned after the defeat of Varus. And from the 2nd century several tribes broke through the border (the Marcomanni and Lombards). In the 4th and 5th centuries, the Germanic peoples finally overwhelmed the last remnants of the \"Limes\". Pollen analyses from this period show that agriculture came to a standstill in many areas. Abandoned Roman castells and manors became forest land.\n\nSettlement patterns in the formerly occupied Germania changed. Permanent settlements were abandoned in favor of semi-sedentary settlement forms. If the forest and soil became exhausted around a settlement, its population moved on. As the population density decreased a succession of forest communities began again in many areas, which had been strongly influenced by the economies of the Roman settlers. The pollen analyses from this period show that the beech (\"Fagus sylvatica\") spread out widely again, both in the areas deserted by the Romans, and along the Pomeranian Baltic coast and to southern Sweden.\n\nRoman colonization saw the first, drastic impact on the forest communities of Central Europe. It left forest-free areas that did not recover from grazing; the species structure in many forest communities were disrupted by selective use and introduced species became part of the vegetation.\n\nThe expansion of the forests as villages were abandoned during the \"Völkerwanderung\" was followed by a period of forest clearance in the Early and High Middle Ages, accompanied by a largely uncontrolled use of timber through deforestation in the context of land acquisition as well as the use of forests as a reservoir for construction timber and firewood. These periods have affected the landscapes of Central Europe right up to the present and created our familiar cultural landscapes.\n\nThe so-called Little Ice Age, with its particularly cold periods from 1570 to 1630 and 1675 to 1715, which was associated with catastrophic crop failures and disease, led to the desettlement of large areas of land into which secondary forest spread. The destruction during and in the aftermath of 30 years of war - in many parts of Germany, the population only recovered to its 1600 level by 1800 or later - also led to the strong afforestation of formerly agricultural lands.\n\nWith the turmoil of the Migration Period, the forest spread into Central Europe again. In areas cultivated during Roman colonization, the forest often regained a foothold. Only at the end of the Migration Period did the area of settlement increase again, and permanent settlements soon developed especially on agronomically suitable soils.\n\nTwo intensive periods of forest clearing can be distinguished. The first lasted from about 500 to about 800 and the second from about 1100 to about 1300, the beginning of the crisis of the 14th century. Especially during the first clearance period, the Carolingian era, those areas that had already been developed by the Romans were resettled. Next, areas that were easily accessible and had fertile soils were colonized.\n\nThe high Central Upland ranges remained empty at this early stage. The first permanent settlements in the Black Forest for example only appear from about 1000, and the Harz was only crossed at this time by difficult footpaths. Riparian forests near rivers (such as B. am Rhein) remained unsettled due to the unpredictability of the river. Water meadow woods further from the river were used. After 800, the pace of settlement and deforestation faltered in Central Europe. The population did not increase significantly due to epidemics and the invasion of foreign peoples (Normans in the north and Magyars in the south).\n\nAs well as swine, large livestock (cattle and horses) were also driven into the forest creating areas of wood pasture, which had clearly negative consequences for forest tree communities. Unlike pigs, which preserved the character of the forest, large domestic animals destroyed the trees. \"Overgrazed\" forests quickly turned into scrub.\n\nParticularly disastrous was the woodland grazing of sheep and goats. The latter in particular are able to destroy older trees thanks to their climbing skills. The grazing of goats in the forest was therefore forbidden in early forest regulations. But the prohibition was often ignored because sheep and goats, as domestic animals of the poorer sections of the population, contributed significantly to their survival.\n\nBeekeeping in the Middle Ages was a major forest activity because honey was still the only sweetener for food until the 19th century. As a result, the rights for beekeeping were managed at a high level. This form of activity is mentioned, for example, in connexion with the Nuremberg Imperial Forest. The existence of honey hunting operations helped to protect the forest. Tree species such as lime, pussy willow, fir and also pine were particularly favoured by this type of work.\n\nForest tillage (\"Waldfeldbau\") was practised from the 11th century and varied according to the region. This form of agriculture was established after the better soils had already been exploited for farming. This type of agricultural \"intermediate use\" (\"Zwischennutzung\") had numerous variants, something that is reflected in the names they were given: \"Hackwald, Hauberge, Reutberge, Birkenberge\" and \"Schiffelland\" are the most common designations.\n\nThe importance of these forms of economy increased during the pre-industrial period. They were constantly improved and formed an elaborate system of secondary forest uses (\"Lohrinde\"), firewood and farming. For this, the trees were first cleared by fire or felling. After the soil had been worked with mattocks or ploughs, it was sown with rye, buckwheat or wheat.\n\nUsually the soil yielded crops for no longer than a year. It was then turned into grazing land until trees grew up again from the stumps or from seed. This form of agriculture had a considerable impact on the composition of forest trees.\n\nResin collecting is one of the oldest forms of forest exploitation. The resin was collected from conifers, of which spruce and pine were preferred. Even this form of forest use caused considerable destruction. It hindered growth and weakened the vitality of entire stands of trees. As a result, early on resin collecting was restricted to stands that were not easily felled and transported i.e. those that were a long way from rivers. Because resin was a popular base material, such bans were ignored everywhere.\n\nEven today, wood is still an important source of energy for mankind. In Central Europe it was replaced by coal during the course of the 19th century. In the Middle Ages there were two quite different uses for firewood from the forests - local and non-local. Locally there was only one requirement that had an unrestricted priority: the use of firewood for home fires. In addition, a range of industry processes required firewood as an energy source or as a raw material, for example: charcoal burning, glassmaking, salt production and mining with its associated hammer mills.\n\nCharcoal burning was carried out in all woods and forests. In woods that were closer to settlements greater care was taken to avoid forest fires and to use only lower value wood. In woods that were more distant from human habitation there were no such restrictions. Charcoal burning generally took place near small rivers and streams that were used to transport the charcoal. In the Middle Ages earthen kilns (\"Erdmeiler\") were exclusively used to produce charcoal.\n\nGlass was highly prized during the Middle Ages and was correspondingly valuable. Forest glassworks often had small settlements tied to them, where the families of the glassblowers lived. Glassworks needed a particularly large supply of wood and were often described in contemporary reports as \"wood-eating businesses\". Glassworks also needed charcoal burners and ash burners, who supplied important fuel for the manufacture of glass. 90% of the wood was used to make potash, the most important raw material for glassmaking; the remaining 10% for the actual glass smelting.\n\nIn the Late Middle Ages the majority of salt deposits were transferred into the ownership of the territorial princes. That started an unrestrained extraction of this important economic commodity. Large quantities of wood were needed for the process of salt mining, both for the construction of galleries as well as for the boiling pans (\"Sudpfannen\") of the saltworks or salines. These took the largest proportion of wood.\n\nHow disastrous the extraction of salt was for some landscapes is illustrated by the example of the town of Lüneburg in North Germany. Before salt was discovered it was surrounded by dense forests, but during the course of salt mining all the woods were cleared. Only a heath landscape remained, a countryside that was further devastated by plaggen agriculture. During the 20th century much of the area to the southwest of Lüneburg became a British military training area, causing further destruction.\n\nMining required three natural conditions: first, the presence of ores; second, large forests, needed for pit props and the wood for producing charcoal; and third, water power in the shape of rivers and streams. Smelting was carried out in the vicinity of the shaft. In the Harz, mining is mentioned as early as the 10th century. Because mining needed such large quantities of wood, its regulation was an early consideration and, by the end of the Middle Ages the first taxes were imposed on forests for their use in the mining industry. Forests in mining regions enjoyed a special status and, early on, their primary use for mining purposes was firmly established.\n\nBuilding and construction timber was exported to various parts of Europe from an early date. Popular types of wood, such as oak and conifers are recorded as being rafted down rivers to the Baltic Sea from the 13th century. Yew was especially prized because of its outstanding properties, especially its flexural strength, which was popular in the manufacture of weapons. In order to make bows, such as the English longbow, entire stands of yew were cleared in Austria. This species of tree was hated by carters because their draught animals died by eating its poisonous fruit. \n\nThe consequences of medieval forest use may be summed up as follows: many cohesive forest areas were largely destroyed, due mainly to the felling of trees for firewood. Even the most remote forest areas were affected. What remained was a landscape whose devastation is still recognizable, for example, the treeless hill ridges, the moorland and the present distribution of tree species in the central European forests.\n\nThe dwindling forests that did not regenerate themselves led to erosion of the soils, including those suitable for agricultural, in the wake of which, fields and settlements had to be abandoned. The result was a shortage of supply, especially in time of war. Given the devastating effects of overexploitation arising for the reasons set out above, territorial lords imposed official regulations for the use of woodland, a case in point being the 1579 Hohenlohe Forest regulations.\n\n\"Holznot\", an imminent or existing acute lack of wood as a raw material, has been a social problem since the 16th century. Due to the realization that coniferous forests naturally regenerate only with difficulty, the planting of conifer seeds was successfully attempted in the Middle Ages.\n\nLarge quantities of wood were needed as a source of energy in private households and in early industrial production, for example, in glassmaking, tanning, the production of soot and in mining (in pit construction to support tunnels against collapse).\n\nIn the Black Forest huge quantities of timber were tied together to form rafts and exported to the Netherlands, where the wood was needed for shipbuilding. Farmers have overexploited forests for centuries through grazing and to make straw. At the end of the 18th century, there were hardly any forests left in Germany (see Deforestation).\nWood eventually became so scarce that, in winter, fence posts, steps and all kinds of wooden objects, that were expendable in the short term, were burned as firewood.\n\nIn places like Germany today, hunters pay fees to the landowner in whose forest they hunt. These fees are covered \"inter alia\" by the use or sale of meat or fur from the animals killed. The hunting of deer is particularly necessary in Central Europe, due to the absence of large carnivores. Without human intervention, certain plant species would be destroyed by selective feeding, which is already seriously endangering some species. For the same reason the goal of ecological forest management, which is moving away from monocultures towards stable mixed forests, has been threatened by high levels of deer. Often spruce which, compared to other tree species is less robust, experiences problems trying to rejuvenate itself on most sites where it grows today after having been artificially planted.\n\nCommercial forests today can be divided into various types, although due to the modern forestry industry, most people today only have mature forests in mind:\n\n\n\n"}

Heat loss is the reason why a compost pile takes so long to decompose. Observers have noted that the time taken to create compost can be dramatically reduced by retaining the heat in a suitably insulated container. Another observation noted is the way the compostable items are added and mixed which allows for aeration. This is an important step in the process. Compost becomes anaerobic due to the absence of air, and this can result in it becoming smelly. By adding large, medium and fine items to the top of the container, space is provided in between the items for the air to flow from bottom to top. This creates a trickle ventilation. Compost made with this method is called aerobic composting (no smell).\n\n\nPlace the waste you want to compost in a bucket or bag, add large pieces (bones, large bark pieces or anything the size of large egg), medium pieces (carrot tops, potato skins, chopped up branches etc.) and fine pieces (grass cuttings, ground egg shells) and carbon (bag of shredded paper, cut up cardboard, torn up cereal boxes, egg cartons, old magazines, newspaper).\n\nMix well or shake the bag. Empty the bag into top of container and close the lid. It must be able to be sealed and not let air enter or escape. Only the top vent should allow a controlled flow of steam to escape. Too much and most of the beneficial heat will escape and too little and the steam turns to streams of water in the inside and drops the internal temperature which in turn lowers the rate of decomposition.\n\nThe hyperthermic bacteria present in the container, derived from the handful of garden soil you added, reproduces and multiplies very quickly, which gives off a lot of heat.\n\nRetaining this heat is the secret to hot container composting. By keeping the container sealed, insulated and controlling the escaping steam, the temperature can be kept with the range needed for hot container composting. Temperatures higher than 70 degrees causes the important hyperthermic bacteria to die off and defeats the plan.\n\nThe smaller the pieces, the quicker the decomposition. Typing paper takes days to decompose, grass clippings take weeks, branches a couple of months, and bark takes several months.\n\nHot container composters aim for a temperature range of between 100 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) to aid optimal bacterial decomposition. A suitable thermometer, analogue or digital, is needed for monitoring this.\n\nIf you don't have a thermometer, you have to wait for the final product to inspect if it is suitable.\n\nThe bottom door is only opened to extract the compost when the top is full. The first time you open the door, there will be partially decomposed material.\n\nThis is due to the most of the decomposition work taking place on the top of the pile (where the heat is concentrated) and this can simply be added to the top during your next top up. Your next collection will probably have been through the process and be ready for use.\n\nLet the collected material stand for aeration for 30 minutes to let the bad odor dissipate. Either remove the larger and medium-sized particles by hand or use a sifter. The larger pieces can be used again.\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages of cold and hot composting.\n\n\n\n"}

The facility was built by the Chevron Corporation for the Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF), as a reserved sanctuary for the rich flora and fauna of the Lekki Peninsula. The company has since provided annual funding for the management of the centre. \n\nIn order to start the conservation project, three potential areas were surveyed in 1987 by NCF technical team in partnership with the defunct Lagos State Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperative. Thereafter, Lekki area was chosen to establish the demonstration site for the conservation project. Locating the conservation project on Lekki Peninsula informed the name of the project – \"Lekki Conservation Centre\". The Centre was established by the Nigerian Conservation Foundation to protect the wildlife and mangrove forests of Nigeria's South-West coastline from the threat of urban development. \n\nThe NCF is a non-governmental organisation dedicated to sustainable development and nature conservation. It also serve as an area of biodiversity conservation and environmental awareness center. The foundation aims to preserve Nigeria's species and ecosystems, promote sustainability when using natural resources and advocates actions that minimise the impact on the environment and prevent resource wastage. NCF has worked tirelessly to raise environmental awareness and promote responsibility. The center is located along the Lekki-Epe Expressway in the Lekki Peninsula, opposite Chevron.\n\nThe reserve area which covers a land area of 78 hectare is located on Lekki Peninsula, next to the Lekki Lagoon, and near the Lagos Lagoon. It protects the wetlands of the Lekki peninsula which consists of swamp and savannah habitats. Approaching the reserve, there's a boulevard of coconut trees which leads to a well laid out car and Visitors Park. It is endowed with an abundance of plant and animal life. Its huge tract of wetlands is set aside for wildlife viewing. Raised walkways enable viewing of animals like monkeys, crocodiles, snakes and various birds. There is also a conservation center and a library.\nThe wetlands are managed by the Nigerian Conservation Foundation, and it now includes a figure-of-eight system of footpaths, with hiking trails and stepping stones to cross waterways. A trail boardwalk was constructed in 1992 to enrich tourists view of the vast resources of the nature reserve which is encapsulated on a mangrove terrain. Side attractions along the trail includes swamp outlook, bird hide, rest stops and the tree house. The 1.8km nature trail behind the foremost main buildings is connected by two wooden tracks. A sturdy wooden track leading to the nature trail, reveals an expansive stretch of marshland and savannah grassland teeming with wildlife, as well as rich aquatic flora and fauna. There's also a tree house which is a twenty-one meters-high tree platform where one can have a panoramic view of the picnic area, reserve, visitor’s center and children’s playground among the trees. The bird hide overlooks a swamp/marsh which is home to crocodiles and monitor lizards. The nature reserve traverses a mosaic of vegetation types: secondary forest, swamp forest and Savanna grassland. Several bird species can be seen here and this It is also popular site for school excursions. The mammal life, although mostly nocturnal is sometimes seen. Small reptiles, and a range of snakes and lizards are also found here. Amphibian life includes a wide range of endangered species. There is a cone-shaped structure which functions as the auditorium for lectures, conferences and seminars. \nAt first glance, there are rare collections of striking pictures of endangered species of animals as well as plants prescribed in glass stands around the oval hall.\n\nEfforts have been made to save different types of animals, reptiles and birdlife from extinction. The endangered species of animals includes bush bucks, crocodiles, mona monkeys, squirrels, snakes, crocodiles, monitor lizards, duikers, giant rats and hogs. While the trees hosts mona monkeys and other species of monkeys, the open grasslands are home to bushbucks, maxwell’s duikers, giant rats, hogs, mongooses, chamelions, squirrels and an impressive variety of birdlife.

The area is currently in a military zone and is closed to visitors. This verse differs considerably from the description of the same event in . In Luke's account, Jesus is one of the crowd that has come to see John and it does not specify who baptized Jesus. Nor does the version at provide many details. Matthew's gospel is much more specific, describing Jesus seeking out John to be baptized.\n\nGerman theologian Heinrich Meyer lists a number of reasons which, in his opinion, fail adequately to explain why Jesus came to be baptized by John:\n\nInstead, Meyer suggests that \"the true meaning appears from , namely, because Jesus was consciously certain that He must, agreeably to God’s will, subject Himself to the baptism of His forerunner, in order (Matthew 3:16-17) to receive the Messianic consecration; that is, the divine declaration that He was the Messiah\".\n\nAccording to David Hill, the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist was one of the most important issues of first century Christianity and Matthew is very specific in these matters.\n"}

QEMSCAN is an abbreviation standing for Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by SCANning electron microscopy, and a registered trademark owned by FEI Company since 2009. Prior to 2009, QEMSCAN was sold by LEO, a company jointly owned by Leica and ZEISS. The integrated system comprises a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with a large specimen chamber, up to four light-element Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detectors, and proprietary software controlling automated data acquisition. The offline software package iDiscover provides data processing and reporting functionality.\n\nQEMSCAN creates phase assemblage maps of a specimen surface scanned by a high-energy accelerated electron beam along a predefined raster scan pattern. Low-count energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) are generated and provide information on the elemental composition at each measurement point. The elemental composition in combination with back-scattered electron (BSE) brightness and x-ray count rate information is converted into mineral phases. QEMSCAN data includes bulk mineralogy and calculated chemical assays. By mapping the sample surface, textural properties and contextual information such as particle and mineral grain size and shape, mineral associations, mineral liberation, elemental deportment, porosity, and matrix density can be calculated, visualized, and reported numerically. Data processing capabilities include combining multiple phases into mineral groups, resolving mixed spectra (boundary phase processing), image-based filtering, and particle-based classification. Quantitative reports can be generated for any selected number of samples, individual particles, and for particle classes sharing similar compositional and/or textural attributes, such as size fractions or rock types.\n\nQEMSCAN is routinely employed in the analysis of rock- and ore-forming minerals. Sample preparation requirements include a level, dry specimen surface, coated with a thin electrically conductive layer (e.g. carbon). The sample must be stable under high vacuum conditions and the electron beam, typically 15 to 25 kV. Common sample types include 30 mm resin-impregnated blocks of drill cuttings and ore, thin sections of drill core and rocks, as well as soil samples. Very small particles such as atmospheric dust have been measured on carbon tape or filter paper. Coal samples are generally mounted in carnauba wax, providing sufficient contrast to allow for separation of the sample from the mounting medium, and subsequent measurement of coal and macerals.\n\nQEMSCAN consists of proprietary software package iDiscover which consists of four software modules:\n\n\nQEMSCAN consists of five customisable measurement modes\n\n\nQEMSCAN measurements can be applied in quantitative mineral characterisation of rocks, weathering products such as regolith and soils, and most man-made materials.

He details how his wish is to capture in his writings more than just a story of killing, and how he hopes his stories will serve the growing protest against the destruction of natural habitat and species. \nThis is the Jungle\n\nKenneth Anderson describes the typical experience of sitting out at night in the Southern Indian Jungle, describing the sights, sounds and creatures you may encounter. \nThe Man-Eater of the Crescent Mountains\n\nWhilst looking for young crocodile specimens in the Cauvery River - Kenneth and his son Donald hear of the man-eating tiger near the towering hill known as the Hogarkhan. Giving up on their crocodile hunt they head to Hogarehalli to find out about the man-eater. Whilst spending a night in the jungle by Maddak Lake, they are awoken by the sound of the man-eater taking his next victim. Tracking the tiger's trail in the early morning they discover the human remains, which turn out to be that of a leper. They then sit over the body throughout the hot day, struggling to keep the vultures from disposing of the kill. The tiger arrives after sundown, and they both get a shot and kill the man-eater together. \nGhooming by Night and Tracking by Day\n\nKenneth Anderson takes us on a typical night ghooming (the Hindustani term indicating 'wandering') in the jungle, followed by a lesson in jungle lore and daytime tracking. \nThe Swami of Valaithothu\n\nA hermit Swami moves into Valaithothu at the same time as a cattle lifting tiger turns man-eater in the area. Various coincidental events make the locals come to believe that in fact the Swami and the tiger are the same being. The Swami exploits the locals superstitions and fears by obtaining free residence and food as payment for stopping the tiger from killing them. Kenneth Anderson hears of the story and heads to Valaithothu to rid the area of the man-eater and show the Swami to be nothing but a fraud. \nBagh the Tiger\n\nAnderson uses his knowledge of Indian wildlife to write a fictional story from the animals point of view. Following Bagh the tiger from learning life lessons as a cub, through to adulthood and finally the unfortunate events that lead to him becoming a man eater.\nThe Villain of Windy valley\n\nSet in the Kollegal Taluk of Coimbatore District in the Windy Valley where a mysterious strong wind appears daily like clockwork between 10pm and 3am - local villagers use inhuman methods to try and rid themselves of cattle lifters. One tigress falls victim to a homemade bomb sewn into the udder of the cow she had killed - blowing away her bottom jaw, she took 3 days to die. The cattle continued to be lifted and so another villager sat out over a kill with his inadequate gun and fired a shot in the dark when the tiger arrived. Only wounding the animal, the tiger turned to man-eating. Anderson, whilst recovering from malaria takes a break from his home and visits the Windy Valley. Using a poorly constructed ground hide he sits over a bait for the man-eater. The tiger arrives, but at the same time as an angry elephant - and as the two animals face off ready to charge, Anderson is left in the middle of the two. \nThe Lonely Panther of Kuppa Gudda Hill\n\nAnderon's son, Donald recounts the story of a panther kill that he greatly regrets. After shooting a panther from his hide in the Kuppa Gudda Hill, he is attacked immediately from behind by a second panther. The panther comes in through the top of the hide and pins Donald to the floor in a fury, Donald only narrowly escapes a mauling or death by firing his rifle into the ground. Later returning to the site of the first panther kill with some villagers, they discover the dead panther to be a heavily pregnant female, and its fur has been wetted by its distraught mate having spent time by its side licking her. The unhappy mate of the panther soon turns to cattle lifting, and Donald tracks the male to a cave to sadly put it out of its misery. \nThe One-legged Dutchman of Wild Heritage\n\nAnderson introduces his friend, Jonklass - a one legged Dutchman who has a jungle resort named 'Wild Heritage'. Jonklass then writes his own story, recounting the tale of his attempt to shoot the Misogynist of Mahvanhalla, a male tiger which had a habit of killing and eating tigress. Whilst awaiting the tiger in a machan, Jonklass witnesses a terrible fight to the death between a male tiger and a one tusked elephant.\n"}
{"id": "712222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=712222", "title": "Transit of Earth from Mars", "text": "Transit of Earth from Mars\n\nA transit of Earth across the Sun as seen from Mars takes place when the planet Earth passes directly between the Sun and Mars, obscuring a small part of the Sun's disc for an observer on Mars. During a transit, Earth would be visible from Mars as a small black disc moving across the face of the Sun. They occur every 26, 79 and 100 years, and every 1,000 years or so there is an extra 53rd-year transit.\n\nTransits of Earth from Mars usually occur in pairs, with one following the other after 79 years; rarely, there are three in the series. The transits also follow a 284-year cycle, occurring at intervals of 100.5, 79, 25.5, and 79 years; a transit falling on a particular date is usually followed by another transit 284 years later. Transits occurring when Mars is at its ascending node are in May, those at descending node happen in November. This cycle corresponds fairly closely to 151 Mars orbits, 284 Earth orbits, and 133 synodic periods, and is analogous to the cycle of transits of Venus from Earth, which follow a cycle of 243 years (121.5, 8, 105.5, 8). There are currently four such active series, containing from 8 to 25 transits. A new one is set to begin in 2394. The last series ending was in 1211.\n\nNo one has ever seen a transit of Earth from Mars, but the next transit will take place on November 10, 2084. The last such transit took place on May 11, 1984.\n\nDuring the event, the Moon could almost always also be seen in transit, although due to the distance between Earth and Moon, sometimes one body completes the transit before the other begins (this last occurred in the 1800 transit, and will happen again in 2394).\n\nA transit of Earth from Mars corresponds to Mars being perfectly uniformly illuminated at opposition from Earth, its phase being 180.0° without any defect of illumination. During the 1879 event, this permitted Charles Augustus Young to attempt a careful measurement of the oblateness (polar compression) of Mars. He obtained the value 1/219, or 0.0046. This is close to the modern value of 1/154 (many sources will cite somewhat different values, such as 1/193, because even a difference of only a couple of kilometers in the values of Mars' polar and equatorial radii gives a considerably different result).\n\nMuch more recently, better measurements of the oblateness of Mars have been made by using radar from the Earth. Also, better measurements have been made by using artificial satellites that have been put into orbit around Mars, including \"Mariner 9\", \"Viking 1\", \"Viking 2\", and Soviet orbiters, and the more recent orbiters that have been sent from the Earth to Mars.\n\nA science fiction short story published in 1971 by Arthur C. Clarke, called \"Transit of Earth\", depicts a doomed astronaut on Mars observing the transit in 1984. This short story was first published in the January 1971 issue of \"Playboy\" magazine.\n\nSometimes Earth only grazes the Sun during a transit. In this case it is possible that in some areas of Mars a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 30 April 1211, and the next such transit will occur on 27 November 4356. It is also possible that a transit of Earth can be seen in some parts of Mars as a partial transit, while in others Earth misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 26 October 664, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December 5934.\n\nThe simultaneous occurrence of a transit of Venus and a transit of Earth is extremely rare, and will next occur in the year 571,471.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1197928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1197928", "title": "Woodes Rogers", "text": "Woodes Rogers\n\nWoodes Rogers (c. 1679 – 15 July 1732) was an English sea captain and privateer and, later, the first Royal Governor of the Bahamas. He is known as the captain of the vessel that rescued marooned Alexander Selkirk, whose plight is generally believed to have inspired Daniel Defoe's \"Robinson Crusoe\".\n\nRogers came from an affluent seafaring family, grew up in Poole and Bristol, and served a marine apprenticeship to a Bristol sea captain. His father held shares in many ships, but he died when Rogers was in his mid-twenties, leaving Rogers in control of the family shipping business. In 1707, Rogers was approached by Captain William Dampier, who sought support for a privateering voyage against the Spanish, with whom the British were at war. Rogers led the expedition, which consisted of two well-armed ships, \"Duke\" and \"Duchess\", and was the captain of \"Duke\". In three years, Rogers and his men went around the world, capturing several ships in the Pacific Ocean. En route, the expedition rescued Selkirk, finding him on Juan Fernandez Island on 1 February 1709. When the expedition returned to England in October 1711, Rogers had circumnavigated the globe, while retaining his original ships and most of his men, and the investors in the expedition doubled their money.\n\nThe expedition made Rogers a national hero, but his brother was killed and Rogers was badly wounded in fights in the Pacific. On his return, he was successfully sued by his crew on the grounds that they had not received their fair share of the expedition profits, and Rogers was forced into bankruptcy. He wrote of his maritime experiences in the book \"A Cruising Voyage Round the World\", which sold well, in part due to public fascination at Selkirk's rescue.\n\nRogers was twice appointed Governor of the Bahamas, where he succeeded in warding off threats from the Spanish, and in ridding the colony of pirates. His first term as governor was financially ruinous, and on his return to England, he was imprisoned for debt. During his second term as governor, Rogers died in Nassau at the age of about 53.\n\nWoodes Rogers was the eldest son and heir of Woods Rogers, a successful merchant captain. Woodes Rogers spent part of his childhood in Poole, England, where he likely attended the local school; his father, who owned shares in many ships, was often away nine months of the year with the Newfoundland fishing fleet. Sometime between 1690 and 1696, Captain Rogers moved his family to Bristol. In November 1697, Woodes Rogers was apprenticed to Bristol mariner John Yeamans, to learn the profession of a sailor. At 18, Rogers was somewhat old to be starting a seven-year apprenticeship.\n\nHis biographer, Brian Little, suggests that this might have been a way for the newcomers to become part of Bristol maritime society, as well as making it possible for Woodes Rogers to become a freeman, or voting citizen, of the city. Little also suggests that it is likely that Rogers gained his maritime experience with Yeamans' ship on the Newfoundland fleet. Rogers completed his apprenticeship in November 1704.\n\nThe following January Rogers married Sarah Whetstone, daughter of Rear Admiral Sir William Whetstone, who was a neighbour and close family friend. Rogers became a freeman of Bristol because of his marriage into the prominent Whetstone family. In 1706, Captain Rogers died at sea, leaving his ships and business to his son Woodes. Between 1706 and the end of 1708, Woodes and Sarah Rogers had a son and two daughters.\n\nThe War of the Spanish Succession started in 1702, during which England's main maritime foes were France and Spain, and a number of Bristol ships were given letters of marque, allowing them to strike against enemy shipping. At least four vessels in which Rogers had an ownership interest were granted the letters. One, \"Whetstone Galley\", named for Rogers' father in law, received the letters before being sent to Africa to begin a voyage in the slave trade. It did not reach Africa, but was captured by the French. Rogers suffered other losses against the French, although he does not record their extent in his book. He turned to privateering as a means of recouping these losses.\n\nIn late 1707, Rogers was approached by William Dampier, a navigator and friend of Rogers' father, who proposed a privateering expedition against the Spanish. This was a desperate move on the part of Captain Dampier to save his career. Dampier had recently returned from leading a two-ship privateering expedition into the Pacific, which culminated in a series of mutinies before both ships finally sank due to Dampier's error in not having the hulls properly protected against worms before leaving port. Unaware of this, Rogers agreed. Financing was provided by many in the Bristol community, including Thomas Goldney II of the Quaker Goldney family and Thomas Dover, who would become president of the voyage council and Rogers' father in law. Commanding two frigates, \"Duke\" and \"Duchess\", and captaining the first, Rogers spent three years circumnavigating the globe. The ships departed Bristol on 1 August 1708. Dampier was aboard as Rogers' sailing master.\n\nRogers encountered various problems along the way. Forty of the Bristol crew deserted or were dismissed, and he spent a month in Ireland recruiting replacements and having the vessels prepared for sea. Many crew members were Dutch, Danish, or other foreigners. Some of the crew mutinied after Rogers refused to let them plunder a neutral Swedish vessel. When the mutiny was put down, he had the leader flogged, put in irons, and sent to England aboard another ship. The less culpable mutineers were given lighter punishments, such as reduced rations. The ships intended to force the chilly Drake Passage off the tip of South America, but expedition leaders soon realised that they were short of warm clothing and alcohol, which was then believed to warm those exposed to cold. Considering the latter the more important problem, the expedition made a stop at Tenerife to stock up on the local wine, and later sewed the ships' blankets into cold weather gear. The ships experienced a difficult inter-oceanic passage; they were forced to almost 62° South latitude, which, according to Rogers, \"for ought we know is the furthest that any one has yet been to the southward\". At their furthest south, they were closer to as-yet-undiscovered Antarctica than to South America.\n\nRogers stocked his ships with limes to fend off scurvy, a practice not universally accepted at that time. After reaching the Pacific Ocean, the ships' provisions of limes were exhausted and seven men died of the vitamin deficiency disease. Dampier was able to guide the ships to little-known Juan Fernandez Island to replenish supplies of fresh produce. On 1 February 1709, as they neared the island, the sailors spotted a fire ashore and feared that it might be a shore party from a Spanish vessel. The next morning Rogers sent a party ashore and discovered that the fire was from Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who had been stranded there four years previously. Selkirk was to become an inspiration for the classic novel \"Robinson Crusoe\", written by Rogers' friend, Daniel Defoe. Rogers found Selkirk to be \"wild-looking\" and \"wearing goatskins\", noting in his journal, \"He had with him his clothes and bedding, with a firelock, some powder, bullets and tobacco, a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible and books.\" Selkirk, who had been part of the ship's crew that abandoned Dampier after losing confidence in his leadership, was now more than willing to join a flotilla that included his old commodore as ship's pilot. Selkirk served as a mate aboard the \"Duke\", and was later given command of one of the prize ships taken by the expedition.\n\nAfter leaving Juan Fernandez on 14 February 1709, the expedition captured and looted a number of small vessels, and launched an attack on the town of Guayaquil, today located in Ecuador. When Rogers attempted to negotiate with the governor, the townsfolk secreted their valuables. Rogers was able to get a modest ransom for the town, but some crew members were so dissatisfied that they dug up the recently dead hoping to find items of value. This led to sickness on board ship, of which six men died. The expedition lost contact with one of the captured ships, which was under the command of Simon Hatley. The other vessels searched for Hatley's ship, but to no avail—Hatley and his men were captured by the Spanish. On a subsequent voyage to the Pacific, Hatley would emulate Selkirk by becoming the centre of an event which would be immortalised in literature. His ship beset by storms, Hatley shot an albatross in the hope of better winds, an episode memorialised by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\n\nThe crew of the vessels became increasingly discontented, and Rogers and his officers feared another mutiny. This tension was dispelled by the expedition's capture of a rich prize off the coast of Mexico: the Spanish vessel \"Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación y Desengaño\". Rogers sustained a wound to the face in the battle. While \"Duke\" and \"Duchess\" were successful in capturing that vessel, they failed to capture \"Encarnación\" companion, a well-armed galleon, \"Nuestra Señora de Begoña\", which made its escape after damaging both vessels. Rogers only reluctantly agreed to giving the inexperienced Captain Dover command of \"Encarnación\", a decision that may have been eased by naming Selkirk as its sailing master. The privateers, accompanied by their two prizes, limped across the Pacific Ocean. The expedition was able to resupply at Guam, which, though governed by the Spanish, extended a cordial welcome to the privateers.\n\nThe ships then went to the Dutch port of Batavia in what is now Indonesia, where Rogers underwent surgery to remove a musket ball from the roof of his mouth, and the expedition disposed of the less seaworthy of the two Spanish prizes. Dealing with the Dutch there constituted a violation of the British East India Company's monopoly. When the ships finally dropped anchor in the Thames River on 14 October 1711, a legal battle ensued, with the investors paying the East India Company £6,000 (about £ at today's values) as settlement for their claim for breach of monopoly, about four percent of what Rogers brought back. The investors approximately doubled their money, while Rogers gained £1,600 (now worth perhaps £) from a voyage which disfigured him and cost him his brother, who was killed in a battle in the Pacific. The money was probably less than he could have made at home, and was entirely absorbed by the debts his family had incurred in his absence. The long voyage and the capture of the Spanish ship made Rogers a national hero. Rogers was the first Englishman, in circumnavigating the globe, to have his original ships and most of his crew survive.\n\nAfter his voyage, he wrote an account of it, titled \"A Cruising Voyage Round the World\". Edward Cooke, an officer aboard \"Duchess\", also wrote a book, \"A Voyage to the South Sea and Round the World\", and beat Rogers to print by several months. Rogers' book was much more successful, with many readers fascinated by the account of Selkirk's rescue, which Cooke had slighted. Among those interested in Selkirk's adventure was Daniel Defoe, who appears to have read about it, and fictionalised the story as \"Robinson Crusoe\".\n\nWhile Rogers' book enjoyed financial success, it had a practical purpose—to aid British navigators and possible colonists. Much of Rogers' introduction is devoted to advocacy for the South Seas trade. Rogers notes that had there been a British colony in the South Seas, he would not have had to worry about food supplies for his crew. A third of Rogers' book is devoted to detailed descriptions of the places that he explored, with special emphasis on \"such <nowiki>[places]</nowiki> as may be of most use for enlarging our trade\". He describes the area of the River Plate in detail because it lay \"within the limits of the South Sea Company\", whose schemes had not yet burst into financial scandal. Rogers' book was carried by such South Pacific navigators as Admiral George Anson and privateering captains John Clipperton and George Shelvocke.\n\nRogers encountered financial problems on his return. Sir William Whetstone had died, and Rogers, having failed to recoup his business losses through privateering, was forced to sell his Bristol home to support his family. He was successfully sued by a group of over 200 of his crew, who stated that they had not received their fair share of the expedition profits. The profits from his book were not enough to overcome these setbacks, and he was forced into bankruptcy. His wife gave birth to their fourth child a year after his return—a boy who died in infancy—and Woodes and Sarah Rogers soon permanently separated.\n\nRogers decided the way out of his financial difficulty was to lead another expedition, this time against pirates. In 1713, Rogers led what was ostensibly an expedition to purchase slaves in Madagascar and take them to the Dutch East Indies, this time with the permission of the British East India Company. Rogers' secondary purpose was to gather details on the pirates of Madagascar, hoping to destroy or reform them, and colonise Madagascar on a future trip. Rogers collected information regarding pirates and their vessels near the island. Finding that a large number of the pirates had gone native, he persuaded many of them to sign a petition to Queen Anne asking her for clemency. While Rogers' expedition was profitable, when it returned to London in 1715, the British East India Company vetoed the idea of a colonial expedition to Madagascar, believing a colony was a greater threat to its monopoly than a few pirates. Accordingly, Rogers turned his sights from Madagascar to the West Indies. His connections included several of the advisers to the new king, George I, who had succeeded Queen Anne in 1714, and Rogers was able to forge an agreement for a company to manage the Bahamas, which were infested with pirates, in exchange for a share of the colony's profits.\n\nAt the time, according to the Governor of Bermuda, the Bahamas were \"without any face or form of Government\" and the colony was a \"sink or nest of infamous rascals\". Until Rogers obtained his commission, the islands had been nominally governed by absentee Lords Proprietor, who did little except appoint a new, powerless governor when the position fell vacant. Under the agreement that underlaid Rogers' commission, the Lords Proprietor leased their rights for a token sum to Rogers' company for twenty-one years.\n\nOn 5 January 1718, a proclamation was issued announcing clemency for all piratical offences, provided that those seeking what became known as the \"King's Pardon\" surrendered not later than 5 September 1718. Colonial governors and deputy governors were authorised to grant the pardon. Rogers was officially appointed \"Captain General and Governor in Chief\" by George I on 6 January 1718. He did not leave immediately for his new bailiwick, but spent several months preparing the expedition, which included seven ships, 100 soldiers, 130 colonists, and supplies ranging from food for the expedition members and ships' crews to religious pamphlets to give to the pirates, whom Rogers believed would respond to spiritual teachings. On 22 April 1718, the expedition, accompanied by three Royal Navy vessels, sailed out of the Thames.\n\nThe expedition arrived on 22 July 1718, surprising and trapping a ship commanded by pirate Charles Vane. After negotiations failed, Vane used a captured French vessel as a fireship in an attempt to ram the naval vessels. The attempt failed, but the naval vessels were forced out of the west end of Nassau harbour, giving Vane's crew an opportunity to raid the town and secure the best local pilot. Vane and his men then escaped in a small sloop via the harbour's narrow east entrance. The pirates had evaded the trap, but Nassau and New Providence Island were in Rogers' hands.\n\nAt the time, the island's population consisted of about two hundred former pirates and several hundred fugitives who had escaped from nearby Spanish colonies. Rogers organised a government, granted the King's Pardon to those former pirates on the island who had not yet accepted it, and started to rebuild the island's fortifications, which had fallen into decrepitude under pirate domination. Less than a month into his residence on New Providence, Rogers was faced with a double threat: Vane wrote, threatening to join with Edward Teach (better known as Blackbeard) to retake the island, and Rogers learned that the Spanish also planned to drive the British out of the Bahamas.\n\nRogers' expedition suffered further setbacks. An unidentified disease killed almost a hundred of his expedition members, while leaving the long-term residents nearly untouched. Two of the three navy vessels, having no orders to remain, left for New York. Ships sent to Havana to conciliate the Spanish governor there never arrived, their crew revolting and becoming pirates mid-voyage. Finally, the third naval vessel left in mid-September, its commander promising to return in three weeks—a promise he had no intention of keeping. Work on rebuilding the island's fortifications proceeded slowly, with the locals showing a disinclination to work.\n\nOn 14 September 1718, Rogers received word that Vane was at Green Turtle Cay near Abaco, about north of Nassau. Some of the pardoned pirates on New Providence took boats to join Vane, and Rogers decided to send two ex-pirate captains, Benjamin Hornigold and John Cockram, with a crew to gather intelligence, and, if possible, to bring Vane to battle. As the weeks passed, and hopes of their return dimmed, Rogers declared martial law and set all inhabitants to work on rebuilding the island's fortifications. Finally, the former pirates returned. They had failed to find an opportunity to kill Vane or bring him to battle, but had captured one ship and a number of pirate captives. Captain Hornigold was then sent to recapture the ships and crews who had gone pirate en route to Havana. He returned with ten prisoners, including captain John Auger, and three corpses. On 9 December 1718, Rogers brought the ten men captured by Hornigold to trial. Nine were convicted, and Rogers had eight hanged three days later, reprieving the ninth on hearing he was of good family. One of the condemned, Thomas Morris, quipped as he climbed the gallows, \"We have a good governor, but a harsh one.\" The executions so cowed the populace that when, shortly after Christmas, several residents plotted to overthrow Rogers and restore the island to piracy, the conspirators attracted little support. Rogers had them flogged, then released as harmless.\n\nOn 16 March 1719 Rogers learned that Spain and Britain were at war again. He redoubled his efforts to repair the island's fortifications, buying vital supplies on credit in the hope of later being reimbursed by the expedition's investors. The Spanish sent an invasion fleet against Nassau in May, but when the fleet's commodore learned that the French (now Britain's ally) had captured Pensacola, he directed the fleet there instead. This gave Rogers time to continue to fortify and supply New Providence, and it was not until 24 February 1720 that a Spanish fleet arrived. Wary of Rogers' defences, the Spanish landed troops on Paradise Island (then known as Hog Island), which shelters Nassau's harbour. They were driven off by Rogers' troops.\n\nThe year 1720 brought an end to external threats to Rogers' rule. With Spain and Britain at peace again, the Spanish made no further move against the Bahamas. Vane never returned, having been shipwrecked and captured in the Bay Islands—a year later, he was hanged in Jamaica. This did not end Rogers' problems as governor. Overextended from financing New Providence's defences, he received no assistance from Britain, and merchants refused to give him further credit. His health suffered, and he spent six weeks in Charleston, South Carolina, hoping to recuperate. Instead, he was wounded in a duel with Captain John Hildesley of HMS \"Flamborough\", a duel caused by disputes between the two on New Providence. Troubled by the lack of support and communication from London, Rogers set sail for Britain in March 1721. He arrived three months later to find that a new governor had been appointed, and his company had been liquidated. Personally liable for the obligations he had contracted at Nassau, he was imprisoned for debt.\n\nWith both the government and his former partners refusing to honour his debts, Rogers was released from debtor's prison only when his creditors took pity on him and absolved him of his debts. Even so, Rogers wrote that he was \"perplexed with the melancholy prospect of <nowiki>[his]</nowiki> affairs\". In 1722 or 1723, Rogers was approached by a man writing a history of piracy, and supplied him with information. The resulting work, \"A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates\", published under the pseudonym Captain Charles Johnson, was an enormous hit on both sides of the Atlantic, and catapulted Rogers for the second time to the status of a national hero. With public attention focused on him again, Rogers was successful in 1726 in petitioning the king for financial redress. Not only did King George I grant him a pension, retroactive to 1721, but the king's son and successor, George II, reappointed him as governor on 22 October 1728.\n\nThe Bahamas did not come under external threat during Rogers' second term, but the reappointed governor had difficulties. Still seeking to bolster the island's defences, Rogers sought imposition of a local tax. The assembly, which had been instituted in Rogers' absence, objected, and Rogers responded by dissolving it. The governmental battle exhausted Rogers, who again went to Charleston in early 1731 in an attempt to recover his health. Though he returned in July 1731, he never truly regained his health, and died in Nassau on 15 July 1732.\n\nA harbour-side street in Nassau is named for Rogers. \"Piracy expelled, commerce restored\" remained the motto of the Bahamas until the islands gained independence in 1973.\n\n\nOther\n\n"}
{"id": "1777190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1777190", "title": "World Oceans Day", "text": "World Oceans Day\n\nWorld Oceans Day takes place every 8 June. It has been celebrated unofficially since its original proposal in 1992 by Canada's International Centre for Ocean Development (ICOD) and the Ocean Institute of Canada (OIC) at the Earth Summit – UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Brundtland Commission, i.e. the World Commission on Environment and Development, provided the inspiration for a global oceans day. The 1987 Brundtland Report noted that the ocean sector lacked a strong voice compared to other sectors. At the first World Oceans Day in 1992, the objectives were to move the oceans from the sidelines to the center of the intergovernmental and NGO discussions and policy and to strengthen the voice of ocean and coastal constituencies world wide.\n\nThe Ocean Project, working in partnership with leading organizations from all sectors, including the World Ocean Network, Association of Zoos and Aquariums, and many others in its network of 2,000 organizations, has been promoting World Oceans Day since 2002 and together with World Ocean Network led a three-year global petition movement to secure official UN recognition. World Oceans Day was officially recognized by the United Nations in late 2008. \n\nWorld Oceans Day events are celebrated on 8 June, the closest weekend, the week, and the month of June. The day is marked in a variety of ways, including launching new campaigns and initiatives, special events at aquariums and zoos, outdoor explorations, aquatic and beach cleanups, educational and conservation action programs, art contests, film festivals, and sustainable seafood events. Youth have been playing an increasingly important role since 2015, including the development in 2016 of a World Oceans Day Youth Advisory Council.\n\nWorld Oceans Day is an annual observation to honor, help protect, and conserve the world's oceans. The ocean provides us with many resources and services including oxygen, climate regulation, food sources, medicine, and more. World Oceans Day also provides an opportunity to take personal and community action to conserve the ocean and its resources.\n\nThe conservation action theme for World Oceans Day 2018 will be \"Preventing plastic pollution and encouraging solutions for a healthy ocean\". The Ocean Project continues to expand the youth-focus of World Oceans Day by further expanding the Youth Advisory Council with the addition of 10 new members. The young minds help to shape and improve World Oceans Day as it grows through the years, providing new perspectives, ideas, and recommendations. Together with the Youth Advisory Council, The Ocean Project and its growing network of partners in 120 countries help rally the world each June and expand ocean conservation year-round.\n\nThe theme for World Oceans Day 2017 was \"Our Oceans, Our Future\", and the conservation action focus was on encouraging solutions to plastic pollution and preventing marine litter. For World Oceans Day 2017, more than 1,000 events were held in 118 countries, including the first United Nations Ocean Conference held in New York City during the week of World Oceans Day. Social media reach for Twitter and Facebook, alone, included nearly 2.8 billion impressions for #WorldOceansDay.\n\nThe theme for World Oceans Day 2016 was \"Healthy Oceans, Healthy Planet.\" World Oceans Day 2016 was celebrated in over 100 countries with over 700 registered events. World Oceans Day trended second on Twitter. Instagram posts about World Oceans Day reached over 290 million people, and over 65 million people were reached on Twitter. Celebrities like Richard Branson, Ellie Goulding, Pharrell Williams, Adrian Grenier, Nelson Mandela and more shared photos and tweeted their support for our oceans. Notable organizations such as the United Nations, CNN, National Geographic, LIFE, the White House and more joined in spreading messages of ocean conservation.\n\nIn the coordination of World Oceans Day, The Ocean Project continued to place a strong focus on youth engagement in 2016. The Ocean Project recognizes the impact youth can have in ocean conservation, and provides youth with the resources and networks needed to have their voices heard. For World Oceans Day 2016, the World Oceans Day Youth Advisory Council was established. There are 11 members on the council all coming from different countries around the world. The new advisory council will help expand the reach and impact of World Oceans Day, on 8 June, and year-round. The Ocean Project plans to focus increasing attention on youth engagement and -leadership. \n\nThe Ocean Project also teamed up with Youth Ocean Conservation Summit and The Big Blue and You to create Sea Youth Rise Up, which brought seven youth ocean conservation leaders to NYC and Washington DC. The youth spoke about pressing ocean issues and solutions in a live google hangout at the New York Aquarium. The youth then headed to Washington DC to meet President Obama's Council on Environmental Quality. This meeting played a role in the formation of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, the United State's first marine protected area in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe world celebrated \"Healthy oceans, healthy planet\" in the first year of a two-year theme for World Oceans Day. Nearly 1,000 events were held at aquariums, zoos, museums, recreational centers, youth clubs, schools, businesses, and countless individuals marked the day by doing something to keep our ocean healthy. Thousands took The Better Bag Challenge for World Oceans Day – promising to use reusable bags rather than disposable plastic bags for a year to help address the problem of marine debris.\n\nAction online increased significantly around World Oceans Day 2015. Millions learned about the Day and ways to help through social media, and tens of thousands were talking about it. The volume of discussion online doubled again in 2015.\n\nMore high-profile events were held, including celebrities getting more involved:\n\nUnited Nations Headquarters in New York City. The Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea held a reception honoring the Day and the winners of the 2nd Annual World Oceans Day Photo Contest.\n\nUNESCO in Paris: The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO organized a full day dedicated to the critical role of the ocean for a healthy climate. The program brought together scientists, political decision-makers, civil society, and youth to develop strategies to reduce climate pollution.\n\nThe UNEP report on microplastics in cosmetics was released. The study, entitled Plastic in Cosmetics: Are We Polluting the Environment Through our Personal Care: Plastic ingredients that contribute to marine microplastic litter is a compilation of currently available knowledge on the linkages between cosmetics and plastic pollution in the oceans.\n\nThe Economist in Lisbon, Portugal: The Economist’s third World Ocean Summit was held just prior to World Oceans Day with the aim to set a new global agenda for the ocean economy. The Summit convened more than 250 leaders from various sectors and ignited a constructive dialogue on developing a blue economy in which economic opportunity is balanced by responsible investment in sustainability.\n\nThe US Department of State, in 16 cities worldwide: The US Department of State’s annual Fishackathon event was organized to make fishing more sustainable through a weekend of connection and coding. Coders volunteered their talents at institutions including aquariums and universities to develop new tools that help fishers work smarter, more safely, and more sustainably.\n\nSupport from great ambassadors: Jack Johnson celebrated with 5 Gyres and youth in the Bahamas, SpongeBob SquarePants went on a tour to zoos and aquariums across the US, Jeff Corwin and Jack Hanna made a splash on TV through a World Oceans Day campaign with Litton Entertainment, and the Octonauts were in many locations and highlighted in numerous publications around the planet to celebrate World Oceans Day.\n\nThe World Oceans Day 2014 theme was \"Together we have the power to protect the ocean\", and focused on raising awareness and promoting personal and community action in fun and positive ways, leading to a more aware, engaged, and sustainable society, and a healthier ocean. More than 700 events took place.\n\nThe World Oceans Day 2013 & 2014 theme was \"Together we have the power to protect the ocean.\"\nEvents totaled more than 600.\n\nThe World Oceans Day 2012 theme was \"Youth: the Next Wave for Change\".\n\nThe Ocean Project launched a completely revamped site for World Oceans Day 2012. \nThere were over 500 events in 55 countries.\n\nThe World Oceans Day 2011 theme was the same as its 2012 celebration. Events increased worldwide.\n\nWorld Oceans Day 2010's theme was \"Oceans of Life: Pick your favorite * Protect your favorite.\" It partnered with Dr. Seuss and the Census of Marine Life.\n\nThe Ocean Project and World Ocean Network recorded over 300 events for WOD 2010, a 26% increase over 2009. Participation in the United States increased by 32% (with participation in 37 states, as compared to 25 states the previous year). 45 countries participated in World Oceans Day 2010, including Bangladesh, Belgium, French Polynesia, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Malta, Malaysia, Venezuela, and Portugal.\n\nOn the first UN-recognized World Oceans Day events number over 200 worldwide, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations gave the following message:\n\"The first observance of World Oceans Day allows us to highlight the many ways in which oceans contribute to society. It is also an opportunity to recognize the considerable challenges we face in maintaining their capacity to regulate the global climate, supply essential ecosystem services and provide sustainable livelihoods and safe recreation.\"\n\n\"Indeed, human activities are taking a terrible toll on the world's oceans and seas. Vulnerable marine ecosystems, such as corals, and important fisheries are being damaged by over-exploitation, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, destructive fishing practices, invasive alien species and marine pollution, especially from land-based sources. Increased sea temperatures, sea-level rise and ocean acidification caused by climate change pose a further threat to marine life, coastal and island communities and national economies.\"\n\n\"Oceans are also affected by criminal activity. Piracy and armed robbery against ships threaten the lives of seafarers and the safety of international shipping, which transports 90 per cent of the world's goods. Smuggling of illegal drugs and the trafficking of persons by sea are further examples of how criminal activities threaten lives and the peace and security of the oceans.\"\n\n\"Several international instruments drawn up under the auspices of the United Nations address these numerous challenges. At their centre lies the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It provides the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out, and is the basis for international cooperation at all levels. In addition to aiming at universal participation, the world must do more to implement this Convention and to uphold the rule of law on the seas and oceans.\"\n\n\"The theme of World Oceans Day, \"Our oceans, our responsibility\", emphasizes our individual and collective duty to protect the marine environment and carefully manage its resources. Safe, healthy and productive seas and oceans are integral to human well-being, economic security and sustainable development.\"\n\nAnnual participation increased to over 100 events.\n\nIn the early years of coordinated efforts by The Ocean Project, with World Ocean Network, events numbered in the dozens. During this time, www.WorldOceansDay.org launched, to help promote the event and generate more involvement through dissemination of resources, ideas, and tools free for everyone to use to celebrate World Oceans Day. Also during this time, TOP and WON launched a petition to the United Nations to officially recognize 8 June as World Oceans Day (UN General Assembly passed resolution in December 2008 officially recognizing the Day).\n\n\n"}
