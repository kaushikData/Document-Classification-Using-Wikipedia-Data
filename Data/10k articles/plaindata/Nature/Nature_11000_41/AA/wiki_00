{"id": "1601078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1601078", "title": "Al-Lat", "text": "Al-Lat\n\nAllat, also spelled Allatu, Alilat, ', and ' (, ) is a name and title used to refer to multiple goddesses worshipped in the ancient Near East, including the Semitic goddesses Asherah and Athirat. More importantly, it refers to the pre-Islamic Arabian goddess worshipped alongside Manāt and al-‘Uzzá throughout the entire peninsula, including Mecca. \n\nAccording to Islamic sources, the tribe of Banu Thaqif in Ta'if especially holds reverence to her. Under Greco-Roman influence, her iconography began to show the attributes of Athena, the Greek goddess of war, as well as her Roman equivalent Minerva. In Islamic tradition, her worship ended when her shrine in Ta'if was demolished on the orders of Muhammad.\n\nThere are two possible etymologies of the name al-Lat. The etymology best reflecting the Arab lexicographical tradition derives the name from the verb \"latta\" (to mix or knead barley-meal). It has also been associated with the \"idol of jealousy\" erected in the temple of Jerusalem according to the Book of Ezekiel, which was offered an oblation of barley-meal by the husband who suspected his wife of infidelity. It can be inferred from al-Kalbi's \"Book of Idols\" that a similar ritual was practiced in the vicinity of the idol of al-Lat. The second etymology, which is more in line with Semitic traditions in general, takes al-Lat to be the feminine form of Allah, with the original, pre-reduction masculine and feminine forms being therefore \"al-'ilāh\" and \"al-'ilāt\" respectively.\n\nThe word al-Lat was used as a name and title for multiple pre-Islamic goddesses of Arabia and was used for either a wife of Allah or a daughter depending on the region. It has been hypothesized that Allat is the consort of Allah based on the fact that it is typical of deities in that area of the world to have consorts. It was used as a title for the goddesses Asherah and Athirat. The word is akin to Elat, which was the name of the wife of the Semitic deity El.\n\nEspecially in older sources, \"Allat\" is an alternative name of the Mesopotamian goddess of the underworld, now usually known as Ereshkigal. She was reportedly also venerated in Carthage under the name Allatu.\n\nAl-Lat was worshipped throughout Arabia, and her cult reached as far as Syria. From Safaitic and Hismaic inscriptions, it is probable that she was worshiped as Lat (\"lt\").\n\nIn Safaitic inscriptions, al-Lat was invoked for solitude and mercy. She was expected to bring well-being, ease and prosperity. Travelers would invoke her for good weather and protection. She was also invoked for vengeance, booty from raids, and infliction of blindness and lameness to anyone who defaces the inscriptions. \nThe Greek historian Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BC, considered her the equivalent of Aphrodite:\n\nHerodotus acknowledged Alilat to be the equivalent of Aphrodite Ourania. According to Herodotus, the ancient Arabians believed in only two gods:\nAl-Lat's worship in South Arabia was not popular. She was not the object of an organized cult, with two amulets (inscribed \"Lat\" on one, \"Latan\" on the other) being the only indication that this goddess received worship.\n\nAl-Lat was worshipped the most in northern Arabia. The Qedarites, a northern Arabian tribal confederation, seemed to also worship al-Lat, as evidenced by a silver bowl dedicated by a Qedarite king, with the goddess' name inscribed on it.\n\nThe Nabataeans and the people of Hatra also worshipped al-Lat, equating her with the Greek goddesses Athena and Tyche and the Roman goddess Minerva. She is frequently called \"the Great Goddess\" in Greek in multilingual inscriptions. The Nabataeans regarded al-Lat as the mother of the deities, and her family relations vary; sometimes she is regarded as the consort of Dushara, other times she is regarded as the mother of Dushara. Nabataean inscriptions state her as well as Al-'Uzza as the \"brides of Dushara\". According to Wellhausen, the Nabataeans believed al-Lat was the mother of Hubal (and hence the mother-in-law of Manāt).\nAl-Lat was also venerated in Palmyra, which housed an Arab population, and there her temple had no signs of blood rituals. The practice of casting divination arrows, a common divination method in Arabia, was attested in her temple; an honorific inscription mentioning \"a basin of silver for [casting] lots (\"lḥlq\")\". By the second-century AD, she began to be portrayed in the style of Athena, and was referred to as \"Athena-Allāt\", but this assimilation does not extend beyond its iconography. A famous statue that once adorned her temple there was the Lion of Al-lāt, once damaged by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), but has been since restored.\n\nIn Islamic sources discussing pre-Islamic Arabia, al-Lat is attested as the chief-goddess of the Banu Thaqif tribe. She was said to be venerated in Taif, where she was called \"ar-Rabbah\" (The Lady). She reportedly had a shrine there which was decorated with ornaments and treasure of gold and onyx. There, the goddess was venerated in the form of a cubic rock. The area around the shrine was sacred; no trees could be felled, no animal hunted and no human blood can be shed.\n\nAl-Lat is also mentioned in pre-Islamic Arab poetry, which were belatedly put into writing. She was alluded by al-Mutalammis in his satire of Amr ibn-Hind:\n<poem>\"Thou hast banished me for fear of lampoon and satire.\"\n\"No! By Allat and all the sacred baetyls (ansab)\"\n\"thou shalt not escape.\"</poem>A poem by the pre-Islamic monotheist Zayd ibn Amr mentions al-Lat, along with Al-Uzza and Hubal:<poem>\"Am I to worship one lord or a thousand?\"\n\"If there are as many as you claim,\"\n\"I renounce al-Lat and al-Uzza, both of them,\"\n\"as any strong-minded person would.\"\n\"I will not worship al-Uzza and her two daughters …\"\n\"I will not worship Hubal, though he was our lord\"\n\"in the days when I had little sense.\"</poem>Al-Lat was also called as daughter of Allah along with the other two chief goddesses Al-'Uzza and Manat.\n\nAccording to the \"Book of Idols\" by Hishām ibn al-Kalbi, the pre-Islamic Arabs believed al-Lat resided in the Kaaba and also had an idol inside the sanctuary:\nIn the Qur'an, she is mentioned along with al-‘Uzzá and Manāt in Sura 53:19–23, a verse that became the subject of the alleged Satanic Verses. The tribe of ʿĀd of Iram of the Pillars is also mentioned in Sura 89:5–8, and archaeological evidence from Iram shows copious inscriptions devoted to her for the protection of a tribe by that name.\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, the shrine dedicated to al-Lat in Ta'if was demolished on the orders of Muhammad, during the Expedition of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, in the same year as the Battle of Tabuk (which occurred in October 630 AD). The destruction of the idol was a demand by Muhammad before he would allow any reconciliation to take place with the tribes of Ta'if, who were under his siege.\n\nF. V. Winnet saw al-Lat as a lunar deity due to association of a crescent with her in 'Ayn esh-Shallāleh and a Lihyanite inscription mentioning the name of Wadd over the title of \"'fkl lt\". René Dussaud and Gonzague Ryckmans linked her with Venus while others have thought her to be a solar deity. John F. Healey considers al-Uzza actually might have been an epithet of al-Lat before becoming a separate deity in Meccan pantheon. \"Redefining Dionysos\" considers she might have been a god of vegetation or a celestial deity of atmospheric phenomena and a sky deity.\n\nIn Ta'if, Al-Lat's primary idol is a cubic stone, which according to the \"Book of Idols\", is associated with a Jew who prepares his barley porridge. \n\nEarly Palmyrene depictions of Al-Lat share iconographical traits with Atargatis (when seated) and Astarte (when standing). The Lion of Al-Lat that once adorned her temple depicts a lion and a gazelle, the lion representing her consort, and the gazelle representing Al-Lat's tender and loving traits, as bloodshed was not permitted under Al-Lat's retaliation.\nAl-Lat was associated with the Greek goddess Athena (and by extension, the Roman Minerva) in Nabataea, Hatra and Palmyra. It seems that her identification with Athena was only a mere change in iconography, and Al-Lat's character noticeably softened the warlike Athena in places where she was equated with. One Nabataean relief of Athena-Al-Lat depicts the goddess bearing both Athena and Al-Lat's attributes. The relief depicts the goddess in the style of Athena, but having a stylized square face (resembling Nabataean eye-idols) in place of the Gorgoneion.\n\nAl-Lat was closely related with Al-'Uzza, and in some regions of the Nabataean kingdom, both Al-Lat and Al-'Uzza were said to be the same goddess. John F. Healey believes that Al-Lat and Al-'Uzza originated as a single goddess, which parted ways in the pre-Islamic Meccan tradition. Susan Krone suggests that both Allat and Al-'Uzza were uniquely fused in central Arabia.\n\nIn Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" series, Al-Lat is the name given to the earth's sun.\n\nMultiple allusions, references and parallels are in Salman Rushdie's \"The Satanic Verses\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193", "title": "Arcology", "text": "Arcology\n\nArcology, a portmanteau of \"architecture\" and \"ecology\", is a field of creating architectural design principles for very densely populated, ecologically low-impact human habitats.\n\nThe term was coined by architect Paolo Soleri, who posited that a completed arcology would provide space for a variety of residential, commercial, and agricultural facilities while minimizing individual human environmental impact. These structures have been largely hypothetical insofar as no arcology, even one envisioned by Soleri himself, has yet been built.\n\nThe concept has been popularized by various science fiction writers. Authors such as Peter Hamilton in \"Neutronium Alchemist\" and Paolo Bacigalupi in \"The Water Knife\" explicitly used arcologies as part of their scenarios. They are often portrayed as self-contained or economically self-sufficient.\n\nAn arcology is distinguished from a merely large building in that it is designed to lessen the impact of human habitation on any given ecosystem. It could be self-sustainable, employing all or most of its own available resources for a comfortable life: power; climate control; food production; air and water conservation and purification; sewage treatment; etc. An arcology is designed to make it possible to supply those items for a large population. An arcology would supply and maintain its own municipal or urban infrastructures in order to operate and connect with other urban environments apart from its own.\n\nArcology was proposed to reduce human impact on natural resources. Arcology designs might apply conventional building and civil engineering techniques in very large, but practical projects in order to achieve pedestrian economies of scale that have proven, post-automobile, to be difficult to achieve in other ways.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright proposed an early version called Broadacre City although, in contrast to an arcology, Wright's idea is comparatively two-dimensional and depends on a road network. Wright's plan described transportation, agriculture, and commerce systems that would support an economy. Critics said that Wright's solution failed to account for population growth, and assumed a more rigid democracy than the U.S.A. actually has.\n\nBuckminster Fuller proposed the Old Man River's City project, a domed city with a capacity of 125,000, as a solution to the housing problems in East St. Louis, Illinois.\n\nPaolo Soleri proposed later solutions, and coined the term 'arcology'. Soleri describes ways of compacting city structures in three dimensions to combat two-dimensional urban sprawl, to economize on transportation and other energy uses. Like Wright, Soleri proposed changes in transportation, agriculture, and commerce. Soleri explored reductions in resource consumption and duplication, land reclamation; he also proposed to eliminate most private transportation. He advocated for greater \"frugality\" and favored greater use of shared social resources, including public transit (and public libraries).\n\nArcosanti is an experimental \"arcology prototype\" – a demonstration project under construction in central Arizona. Designed by Paolo Soleri, its primary purpose is to demonstrate Soleri's personal designs, his application of principles of arcology to create a pedestrian-friendly urban form.\n\nMany cities in the world have proposed projects adhering to the design principles of the arcology concept, like Tokyo, and Dongtan near Shanghai. The Dongtan project may have collapsed, and it failed to open for the Shanghai World Expo in 2010.\n\nCertain urban projects reflect arcology principles. Pedestrian connection systems often provide a wide range of goods and services in a single structure. Some examples include the +15 system in downtown Calgary, Montréal's RÉSO, the Minneapolis Skyway System, The Windscreen in Fermont, Quebec, and the Houston, Texas tunnel system. They include supermarkets, malls and entertainment complexes. The +15 is the world's most extensive skywalk, at in total length. Minneapolis has the longest single path, at . Seward's Success, Alaska was never built, but would have been a small city just outside Anchorage. Chicago has a sizeable tunnel system known as the Chicago Pedway connecting a portion of the buildings in the Chicago Loop.\n\nThe Las Vegas Strip has many arcology features to protect people from the heat. Many major casinos are connected by tunnels, footbridges, and monorails. It is possible to travel from Mandalay Bay at the south end of the Strip to the Las Vegas Convention Center, to the north, without using streets. In many cases, it is possible to travel between several different casinos without ever going outdoors. It is possible to live in this complex without need to venture outside, except the Strip has not generally been considered self-sustainable. Soleri did not advocate for enclosed cities, although he did sketch a design and build a model of an 'arcology' for outer space.\n\nThe Toronto downtown area features an underground pedestrian network, PATH. Multiple high-rises are connected by a series of underground tunnels. It is possible to live in this complex without needing to venture outside, but the PATH network is not self-sustaining. The total network spans .\n\nMcMurdo Station of the United States Antarctic Program and other scientific research stations on Antarctica resemble the popular conception of an arcology as a technologically advanced, relatively self-sufficient human community. The Antarctic research base provides living and entertainment amenities for roughly 3,000 staff who visit each year. Its remoteness and the measures needed to protect its population from the harsh environment give it an insular character. The station is not self-sufficientthe U.S. military delivers 30,000 cubic metres (8,000,000 US gal) of fuel and of supplies and equipment yearly through its Operation Deep Freeze resupply effortbut it is isolated from conventional support networks. The base generates electricity with its own power plant, and grows fruits and vegetables in a hydroponic green house when resupply is non-existent. Under international treaty, it must avoid damage to the surrounding ecosystem.\n\nCrystal Island is a proposed arcology in Moscow, Russia. In 2009, construction was postponed indefinitely due to the global economic crisis.\n\nThe Begich Towers operates like a small-scale arcology encompassing nearly all of the population of Whittier, Alaska. The pair of buildings contains residential housing as well as a school, grocery, and municipal offices.\nWhittier once boasted a second structure known as the Buckner Building. The Buckner Building still stands but was deemed unfit for habitation after the 1969 earthquake.\n\nMost proposals to build real arcologies have failed due to financial, structural or conceptual shortcomings. Arcologies are therefore found primarily in fictional works.\n\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n\nUsage of \"arcology\" vs. \"hyperstructure\"\n"}
{"id": "23204695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23204695", "title": "Beta angle", "text": "Beta angle\n\nThe beta angle (formula_1) is a measurement that is used most notably in orbital spaceflight. The beta angle determines the percentage of time that a satellite in low Earth orbit (LEO) spends in direct sunlight, absorbing solar energy. The term is defined as the angle between the orbital plane of the satellite and the vector to the Sun (i.e., the direction from which the Sun is shining). The beta angle is the smaller of the two angles between the Sun vector and the plane of the object's orbit. The beta angle does not define a unique orbital plane; all satellites in orbit with a given beta angle at a given altitude have the same exposure to the Sun, even though they may be orbiting in completely different planes around Earth.\n\nThe beta angle varies between +90° and −90°, and the direction in which the satellite orbits its primary body determines whether the beta angle sign is positive or negative. An imaginary observer standing on the Sun defines a beta angle as positive if the satellite in question orbits in a counterclockwise direction and negative if it revolves clockwise. The maximum amount of time that a satellite in a normal LEO mission can spend in Earth's shadow occurs at a beta angle of 0°. A satellite in such an orbit spends no more than 59% of its orbital period in sunlight.\n\nThe degree of orbital shadowing an object in LEO experiences is determined by that object's beta angle. An object launched into an initial orbit with an inclination equal to the complement of the Earth's inclination to the ecliptic results in an initial beta angle of 0 degrees (formula_2 = 0°) for the orbiting object. This allows the object to spend the maximum possible amount of its orbital period in the Earth's shadow, and results in extremely reduced absorption of solar energy. At a LEO of 280 kilometers, the object is in sunlight through 59% of its orbit (approximately 53 minutes in Sunlight, and 37 minutes in shadow.) On the other extreme, an object launched into an orbit parallel to the terminator results in a beta angle of 90 degrees (formula_2 = 90°), and the object is in sunlight 100% of the time. An example would be a polar orbit initiated at local dawn or dusk on an equinox. Beta angle can be controlled to keep a satellite as cool as possible (for instruments that require low temperatures, such as infrared cameras) by keeping the beta angle as close to zero as possible, or, conversely, to keep a satellite in sunlight as much as possible (for conversion of sunlight by its solar panels, for solar stability of sensors, or to study the Sun) by maintaining a beta angle as close to +90 or -90 as possible.\n\nThe above discussion defines the beta angle of satellites orbiting the Earth, but a beta angle can be calculated for any orbiting three body system: the same definition can be applied to give the beta angle of other objects. For example, the beta angle of a satellite in orbit around Mars, with respect to the Earth, defines how much of the time the satellite has a line of sight to the Earth - that is, it determines how long the Earth is shining on the satellite and how long the Earth is blocked from view. That same satellite also will have a beta angle with respect to the Sun, and in fact it has a beta angle for any celestial object one might wish to calculate one for: any satellite orbiting a body (i.e. the Earth) will be in that body's shadow with respect to a given celestial object (like a star) some of the time, and in its line-of-sight the rest of the time. Beta angles describing non-geocentric orbits are important when space agencies launch satellites into orbits around other bodies in the Solar System.\n\nWhen the space shuttle was in service on missions to the International Space Station, the beta angle of the space station's orbit was a crucial consideration; periods referred to as \"beta cutout\", during which the shuttle could not safely be launched to the ISS, were a direct result of the beta angle of the space station at those times. When the orbiter was in-flight (not docked to ISS) and it flew to a beta angle greater than 60 degrees, the orbiter went into \"rotisserie\" mode, and slowly rotated around its X-axis (nose to tail axis). For flights to ISS, the shuttle could launch during an ISS beta cutout if the ISS would be at a beta less than 60 degrees at dock, and throughout the docked phase. Therefore, the mission duration affected launch timing when the beta cutout dates were approaching.\n\n\n"}

He has been a Professor of Physics at the University of Texas at Dallas since 1976 and has served many national and international scientific organizations. He obtained his PhD from the University of Canterbury in New Zealand in November, 1963, for research on optical emissions from the upper atmosphere (airglow and aurorae). With his wife, Beatrice Tinsley, he came to Dallas to work at the newly formed Southwest Center for Advanced Studies, which became the University of Texas at Dallas in 1969. Beatrice obtained a Ph.D. in astrophysics at the University of Texas at Austin, and became a prominent astrophysicist before she died in 1981, resulting in the University of Texas at Austin creating the endowed professorship that bears her name.\n\nDuring his time at the NSF in the late 1980s he began researching the effects of changes in the sun on weather and climate on the day-to-day, decadal and century timescale. He has been author of more than 40 papers on this topic. He has proposed a mechanism in which the link to the atmosphere is the solar wind (space weather) (as opposed to changes in solar brightness) that affects the downward ionosphere-earth current density (Jz) in the global atmospheric electric circuit.\n\nHe formed the hypothesis that the Jz effects are due to electrical charge deposited on droplets and aerosol particles (notably condensation nuclei and ice-forming nuclei in clouds) that significantly affect scavenging processes and the concentrations of the nuclei. The consequences of this include changes in cloud cover and rates of precipitation, and changes in surface pressure and atmospheric dynamics, as has been observed.\n\nDr. Tinsley and Dr. Burns of the Australian Antarctic Research Division and Dr. Zhou of the East China Normal University have shown that there are clear correlations between the electric current output of the internal atmospheric generators (thunderstorms) in the global electric circuit and surface pressure at both Antarctic and Arctic sites, fully consistent with the changes due to the solar wind. Thus the work has led to the discovery of an unexpected process in meteorology that has implications for climate. That is that the internal generation of atmospheric electricity, mostly in the tropical regions, affects clouds and meteorological processes all over the globe. Because the external as well as this internal current generation change on daily, seasonal, and longer timescales (including with global warming) it is an additional input to weather and climate on those timescales that has not been included in current global climate models. Observations of cloud changes in polar regions and models of cloud charging and the effects of charge on cloud microphysics confirm these findings. \n"}

This Business Unit was formed essentially as a synthesis of the pre-existing CSIRO Division of Marine and Atmospheric Research (CMAR), representing the scientific capability, and the previously established Wealth from Oceans (WfO) Flagship, which was the route via which much of the relevant Australian government research funding was directed. As at 2016, its Director is Dr. Ken Lee, previously WfO Flagship Director. The O&A Business Unit currently employs between 350 and 400 staff who are located at its various laboratories including Hobart (Tasmania), Aspendale (Victoria), Dutton Park (Queensland), Black Mountain (Canberra) and Floreat Park (Western Australia). For 2016 it was quoted as operating with an annual budget of $108M Australian Dollars with its research organised into the following the following programs: Climate Science Centre; Coastal Development and Management; Earth System Assessment; Engineering and Technology; Marine Resources and Industries; and Ocean and Climate Dynamics. Certain previous CMAR activities, notably those involving the operation of the Marine National Facility (research vessel) RV Investigator and several scientific collections, are now managed within the separate CSIRO National Facilities and Collections Program.\n\nThe previous CSIRO Division of Marine and Atmospheric Research was itself formed as a result of a 2005 merger between the former CSIRO Division of Marine Research, with laboratories in Hobart, Brisbane, and Perth, and CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research, with laboratories in Aspendale and Canberra; the Division of Marine Research was formed in 1997 as a merger between two previous CSIRO Divisions, the Division of Fisheries Research and the Division of Oceanography, both with their headquarters in Hobart since 1984; prior to that time, the Division of Fisheries and Oceanography (subsequently separate Divisions) had occupied facilities in Cronulla, New South Wales since its inception in 1938 (following the CSIRO's departure this site became the New South Wales State Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre). Additional details of the somewhat convoluted organisational history of the relevant Divisions and their predecessors are available here.\n\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s the marine Divisions of CSIRO had the use of both the RV Southern Surveyor, equipped for biological as well as oceanographic research, and the purpose built RV Franklin for physical and chemical oceanographic research, both of which served at various times as the Marine National Facility for the nation (meaning that other agencies could also carry out research using these vessels at what was effectively a subsidised rate by the Australian government). The last of the vessels to be retired, the Southern Surveyor, was replaced in 2014 by a new purpose built research vessel to serve as the Marine National Facility, the RV Investigator. Coupled with these major vessels, all capable of significant ocean-going research expeditions, staff were able to use a range of smaller boats and sometimes, charter vessels to carry out research in a range of coastal waters.\n\nIn February 2016 the chief executive of CSIRO, Dr Larry Marshall, announced that research into the fundamentals of climate science was no longer a priority for CSIRO and up to 110 jobs were feared to be cut from the climate research section(s) of the Oceans and Atmosphere Unit. After overwhelming negative reaction both within Australia and overseas, along with the forced redundancy of prominent climate scientists including the internationally renowned sea level expert Dr John Church, the Australian Government intervened with a directive and promise of new money to support the restoration of 15 jobs and the creation of a new Climate Science Centre to be based in Hobart with a staff of 40, with funding guaranteed for 10 years from 2016, although the expected number of job losses for O&A was still estimated at 75. While the establishment of the new Centre was described as a \"major U-turn in the direction of the CSIRO\" and a win for the Turnbull government over the previous CSIRO announcement, the generally positive reaction from other scientists was qualified by the fact that the new Centre would still represent a net loss to CSIRO's previous capability in this area. A more detailed account of this episode is available elsewhere on Wikipedia here.\n\n\n\"CSIRO At Sea\", a \"popular\" account of the early research activities of the marine components of the relevant CSIRO Divisions (former Divisions of Fisheries, Fisheries and Oceanography, Oceanography, and Fisheries Research) was published in 1988, a few years after the relocation of the majority of CSIRO's marine research activities to Hobart from Cronulla, New South Wales.\n\n\n"}

The name comes to us from Pliny the Elder who reveals that 30 years after the Roman invasion of Britain their knowledge of it did not extend beyond the neighbourhood of \"silva caledonia\". He gives no information about where the \"silva caledonia\" was, but the known extent of the Roman occupation suggest that it was north of the River Clyde and west of the River Tay.\n\nThe Scots pines of the Caledonian Forest are directly descended from the first pines to arrive in Scotland following the Late Glacial; arriving about 7000 BC. The forest reached its maximum extent about 5000 BC, after which the Scottish climate became wetter and windier. This changed climate reduced the extent of the forest significantly by 2000 BC. From that date, human actions (including the grazing effects of sheep and deer) reduced it to its current extent.\n\nToday, that forest exists as 35 remnants, as authenticated by Steven & Carlisle (1959) (or 84 remnants, including later subjective subdivisions of the 35) covering about or . The Scots pines of these remnants are, by definition, directly descended from the first pines to arrive in Scotland following the ice age. These remnants have adapted genetically to different Scottish environments, and as such, are globally unique; their ecological characteristics form an unbroken, 9000 year chain of natural evolution with a distinct variety of soils, vegetation, and animals.\n\nTo a great extent the remnants survived on land that was either too steep, too rocky, or too remote to be agriculturally useful. The largest remnants are in Strathspey and Strath Dee on highly acidic, freely drained glacial deposits that are of little value for cultivation and domestic stock. An examination of the earliest maps of Scotland suggests that the extent of the Caledonian Forest remnants has changed little since 1600.\n\nFollowing the last glacial period, trees began to recolonise what is now the British Isles over a land bridge which is now beneath the Strait of Dover. Forests of this type were found all over what is now the island of Great Britain for a few thousand years, before the climate began to slowly warm in the Atlantic period, and the temperate coniferous forests began retreating north into the Scottish Highlands, the last remaining climatic region suitable for them in the British Isles (see Climate of Scotland).\n\nThe native pinewoods which formed this westernmost outpost of the taiga of post-glacial Europe are estimated to have covered as a vast wilderness of Scots pine, birch, rowan, aspen, juniper, oak and a few other hardy species. On the west coast, oak and birch predominated in a temperate rainforest ecosystem rich in ferns, mosses and lichens.\n\nIn the Matter of Britain, the forest is the site of one of King Arthur's Twelve Battles, according to the \"Historia Brittonum\", in which the battle is called \"Cat Coit Celidon\". Scholars Rachel Bromwich and Marged Haycock suggest that the army of trees animated by sorcerers in the Old Welsh poem \"Cad Goddeu\" (\"Battle of the Trees\") are intended to be the Caledonian Forest.\n\nIn related Merlin literature, the figure of Myrddin Wyllt retreated to these woods in his madness after the Battle of Arfderydd in the year 573. He fled from the alleged wrath of the king of Strathclyde, Rhydderch Hael, after the slaying of Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio. This is written in the two Merlinic poems in Middle Welsh \"Yr Oinau\" and \"Yr Afallenau\" in the Black Book of Carmarthen. The forest is also the retreat of another character named Lailoken from the \"Vita Kentigerni\", who also fled into the woods in a fit of madness and who may be the original model for Myrddin Wyllt.\n\nIn the Middle Welsh story \"Culhwch and Olwen\", the main character Culhwch is the son of a king named Celyddon Wledig, who may or may not be related to the forest in name. Another figure from the same story, Cyledyr Wyllt hints at a close relationship of the forest being a retreat for people who suffered from a special kind of madness or \"gwyllt\" (Irish \"geilt\"). In line 994 to 996 of the story, it is briefly explained, \"a Chyledyr Wyllt y uab, a llad Nwython a oruc a diot y gallon, a chymhell yssu callon y dat, ac am hynny yd aeth Kyledyr yg gwyllt\" (\"and his son Kyledyr the Wild. Gwynn killed Nwython and cut out his heart, and forced Kyledyr to eat his father's heart, and that is how Kyledyr went mad\"). Though not named directly, the very name Kyledyr Wyllt is close to the two related notions of the forest of \"Celyddon\" being where people suffering madness or \"gwyllt\" hide.\n\nBeing a unique ecosystem in the British Isles, the Caledonian Pinewoods are home to some of the islands' rarest wildlife. It is considered to be one of the last remaining wildernesses in the British Isles.\n\nBreeding bird species in Caledonian pine forests found breeding nowhere else in the British Isles:\n\nBreeding bird species in Caledonian pine forests rare elsewhere in the British Isles:\n\nMammal species present in Caledonian pine forests:\n\n\nMammal species extinct in Caledonian pine forests:\n\nA review of the native pinewoods of Scotland \"Steven & Carlisle (1959)\" highlighted the plight of the remaining 35 ancient pinewood sites, many of which had been damaged by felling, fire and intensive grazing from sheep and deer. A later review in the 1980s showed that further damage had occurred through ploughing and planting with non-native conifers with less than 12,000 ha of the ancient habitat remaining. A subsequent guide to the ancient pinewoods reviews the conservation story and provides a summary of the management in each site as well as a guide on how to reach all the woods using public transport, walking, and cycling. Much of remaining Caledonian pine forest is fully protected, and much of the forest now lies within the Cairngorms National Park. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Forestry Commission also own several areas of pinewood on their reserves. One of the largest remaining areas is Ballochbuie Forest on the Balmoral Estate, which is protected as a Special Area of Conservation under the European Union Habitats Directive.\n\nScientific research continues on the ecology of the Caledonian Forest and its restoration. Populations of the rare groundcover, \"Linnaea borealis\", may be too isolated from one another to produce viable seed. Diversity of fungi has also been affected by the decrease in habitat. The agaric fungus \"Mycena purpureofusca\" is commonly found in Caledonian pine woods, and it is considered an indicator species for that habitat type. Fire appears to increase the natural recruitment of Scots pine seedlings.\n\nThe charity Trees for Life (Scotland) has been working to conserve the remaining forest, and reforest areas where it has been lost. This involves the reintroduction of the full range of native flora, including funguses which assist soil regeneration.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest to reintroduce animals which are currently extinct in Great Britain, back into Caledonian pine forests. Corporations have been set up to persuade the government to allow this. The long-running campaign to reintroduce the Eurasian beaver to Knapdale in Argyll has been successful, and there is some support for the reintroduction of the Gray wolf and Eurasian lynx.\n\nRecently, some landowners have announced plans to build large game reserves on their land and release the species within them. Paul Lister plans to release Eurasian lynx, brown bear, grey wolf, elk, wild boar and species already present in Scotland into a huge enclosure at his estate, Alladale Wilderness Reserve, although releasing top predators such as wolves and bears has become a difficult proposition with local and national regulations. An initial trial enclosure of was built with elk, wild boar, red deer and roe deer.\n\nBain (2013) lists 38 ancient pinewood sites in Britain which have been identified as the most genuinely native and natural. All of them occur in the Scottish Highlands. The Caledonian Pinewood Inventory identifies 84 pinewood sites which includes smaller sub-units of the main sites. A new comprehensive survey of the native woodlands of Scotland from Forestry Commission Scotland and supported by Scottish Natural Heritage is due to be completed in 2014.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11580567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11580567", "title": "Caribbean large igneous province", "text": "Caribbean large igneous province\n\nThe Caribbean large igneous province (CLIP) consists of a major flood basalt, which created this large igneous province (LIP). It is the source of the current large eastern Pacific oceanic plateau, of which the Caribbean-Colombian oceanic plateau is the tectonized remnant. The deeper levels of the plateau have been exposed on its margins at the North and South American plates. The volcanism took place between 139 and 69 million years ago, with the majority of activity appearing to lie between 95 and 88 Ma. The plateau volume has been estimated as on the order of 4 x 10 km³. It has been linked to the Galápagos hotspot.\n\nDivergence between the North American and South American Plates began to create oceanic crust off Colombia's Pacific coast by the end of the Jurassic (150 Ma). This divergence, which continued until at least 66 Ma, first resulted in a \"proto-Caribbean spreading ridge\" between these plates flanked by a perpendicular transform zone on its Pacific side. By 135–130 Ma, the subduction of the Farallon Plate had begun along this transform zone, effectively modifying it into a subduction zone and beginning the creation of the Great Caribbean Arch. This arch was formed around 120-115 Ma but must have been intersected by the Caribbean spreading ridge until 66 Ma. Hence, the Farallon Plate fed the spreading zone and later became the Caribbean Plate.\n\nCLIP formed as a large igneous province and now forms a thickened zone of oceanic crust between the North American and South American Plates.\nIn some places the oceanic crust is 2–3 times as thick as normal oceanic crust ( vs . Its composition is similar to that of the Ontong Java Plateau.\n\nGeochemical and geochronological evidences clearly indicate that the Galápagos hotspot initiated the formation of the CLIP 95-90 Ma in the eastern Pacific. From there it move north-east with the Farallon Plate between the two American plates until it collided with a volcanic arc, the Greater Antilles 60 million years later. Fragments of this voyage is preserved in accreted seamounts along the Central American coast and the Cocos and Carnegie Ridges. Isotopic profiles of Galápagos rocks can be matched with those from CLIP rocks.\n\n92–63 Ma Ar/Ar ages have been reported for the Curaçao Lava Formation and 94–83 ma for the Dumisseau Formation in Haiti, dating both locations back to the original LIP formation 94 Ma. CLIP volcanism originates from the plume-like source distinct from a MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt) mantle. The long duration of CLIP volcanism can be explained by the interaction between a plume and the Greater Antilles subduction zone.\n\nThe margins of the CLIP have been uplifted and are exposed above sea level, which makes it unique among oceanic plateaus. It stretches east to west and north to south. The CLIP is composed of irregularly thickened (up to ) oceanic crust of the Caribbean Plate and the deformed associated magmatic terranes obducted onto the Pacific coasts of northern South America, Central America, and the Antilles. One of the least deformed parts is Gorgona Island off Colombia's Pacific coast.\n\nThe CLIP was created during three phases of eruptions dating between the Aptian and the Maastrichtian: a first phase 124–112 Ma; the main magma production phase 94–83 Ma; and an 80–72 Ma phase. The youngest igneous rocks, in the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica, are from 63 Ma.\nThat the CLIP originated in the Pacific is obvious because fragments of oceanic crust accreted to the margins of the Caribbean, for example on Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, contain fauna of Pacific provenance.\n\nThe Farallon Plate's eastward movement forced the northern half of the CLIP into the ocean basin that had opened between North and South America starting in the Jurassic. However, the mechanisms causing the NE movement of the CLIP remains unclear, especially considering the subduction in the Costa Rica-Panama arc initiated during the Campanian (83–72 Ma). The Galápagos hotspot is probably responsible for the main plume-related magmatic event 90 Ma, whilst the 76 Ma and 55 Ma event are related to lithospheric thinning in the Central Caribbean.\n\nAr/Ar dating have determined that the main magmatism occurred (Ma) while a second pulse occurred 81-69 Ma. Around 86 Ma the arrival of a large plume initiated the Galápagos hotspot which resulted in volcanism over large parts of the Caribbean Plate and north-west South America. Renewed volcanism about 75 Ma has been attributed to either the Galápagos hotspot, thinning of the lithosphere coupled with associated melting and upwelling of plume-head material, or both.\n\nSeismic and geochemical analyses, on the other hand, suggest the CLIP consists of several oceanic plateaus and palaeo-hotspot tracks formed 139-83 Ma some of which have been overprinted by later magmatism. If these first volcanic activities were generated by the Galápagos hotspot, it would make it the oldest still active hotspot on Earth.\n\n\n"}

Examples of such climate mitigation policies include improved energy efficiency of plants, renewable energy uptake and fuel switching which might enable a range of co-benefits such as air-pollution impacts, technological innovation, energy-supply security through increased energy diversity, reduced fuel cost and employment possibilities. \n\nCo-benefits of GHG mitigation can be an important decision criteria in analyses carried out by policy-makers, but they are often neglected, and often the co-benefits are not quantified, monetised or even identified by businesses and decision-makers. Appropriate consideration of co-benefits can greatly influence policy decisions concerning the timing and level of mitigation action, and there can be significant advantages to the national economy and technical innovation.\n\nDifferent research groups currently examine the impacts of co-benefits of climate change mitigation. One of these projects is the COBENEFITS project of the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Potsdam, Germany. The COBENEFITS project is part of the International Climate Initiative (IKI). The Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) supports this initiative on the basis of a decision adopted by the German Bundestag. The project is conducted in close collaboration with government ministries, agencies, research institutions, and think tanks as political partners and knowledge partners in the target countries.

{"id": "5236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5236", "title": "Coast", "text": "Coast\n\nThe coast, also known as the coastline or seashore, is the area where land meets the sea or ocean, or a line that forms the boundary between the land and the ocean or a lake. A precise line that can be called a coastline cannot be determined due to the Coastline paradox.\n\nThe term \"coastal zone\" is a region where interaction of the sea and land processes occurs. Both the terms coast and coastal are often used to describe a geographic location or region; for example, New Zealand's West Coast, or the East and West Coasts of the United States. Edinburgh for example is a city on the coast of Great Britain.\n\nA pelagic coast refers to a coast which fronts the open ocean, as opposed to a more sheltered coast in a gulf or bay. A shore, on the other hand, can refer to parts of land adjoining any large body of water, including oceans (sea shore) and lakes (lake shore). Similarly, the somewhat related term \"[stream bed/bank]\" refers to the land alongside or sloping down to a river (riverbank) or body of water smaller than a lake. \"Bank\" is also used in some parts of the world to refer to an artificial ridge of earth intended to retain the water of a river or pond; in other places this may be called a levee.\nWhile many scientific experts might agree on a common definition of the term \"coast\", the delineation of the extents of a coast differ according to jurisdiction, with many scientific and government authorities in various countries differing for economic and social policy reasons. According to the UN atlas, 44% of people live within of the sea.\n\nTides often determine the range over which sediment is deposited or eroded. Areas with high tidal ranges allow waves to reach farther up the shore, and areas with lower tidal ranges produce deposition at a smaller elevation interval. The tidal range is influenced by the size and shape of the coastline. Tides do not typically cause erosion by themselves; however, tidal bores can erode as the waves surge up river estuaries from the ocean.\n\nWaves erode coastline as they break on shore releasing their energy; the larger the wave the more energy it releases and the more sediment it moves. Coastlines with longer shores have more room for the waves to disperse their energy, while coasts with cliffs and short shore faces give little room for the wave energy to be dispersed. In these areas the wave energy breaking against the cliffs is higher, and air and water are compressed into cracks in the rock, forcing the rock apart, breaking it down. Sediment deposited by waves comes from eroded cliff faces and is moved along the coastline by the waves. This forms an abrasion or cliffed coast.\n\nSediment deposited by rivers is the dominant influence on the amount of sediment located on a coastline. Today riverine deposition at the coast is often blocked by dams and other human regulatory devices, which remove the sediment from the stream by causing it to be deposited inland.\n\nLike the ocean which shapes them, coasts are a dynamic environment with constant change. The Earth's natural processes, particularly sea level rises, waves and various weather phenomena, have resulted in the erosion, accretion and reshaping of coasts as well as flooding and creation of continental shelves and drowned river valleys (rias).\n\nThe coast and its adjacent areas on and off shore are an important part of a local ecosystem: the mixture of fresh water and salt water (brackish water) in estuaries provides many nutrients for marine life. Salt marshes and beaches also support a diversity of plants, animals and insects crucial to the food chain.\n\nThe high level of biodiversity creates a high level of biological activity, which has attracted human activity for thousands of years.\n\nMore and more of the world's people live in coastal regions. Many major cities are on or near good harbors and have port facilities. Some landlocked places have achieved port status by building canals.\n\nThe coast is a frontier that nations have typically defended against military invaders, smugglers and illegal migrants. Fixed coastal defenses have long been erected in many nations and coastal countries typically have a navy and some form of coast guard.\n\nCoasts, especially those with beaches and warm water, attract tourists. In many island nations such as those of the Mediterranean, South Pacific and Caribbean, tourism is central to the economy. Coasts offer recreational activities such as swimming, fishing, surfing, boating, and sunbathing. Growth management can be a challenge for coastal local authorities who often struggle to provide the infrastructure required by new residents.\n\nCoasts also face many human-induced environmental impacts. The human influence on climate change is thought to contribute to an accelerated trend in sea level rise which threatens coastal habitats.\n\nPollution can occur from a number of sources: garbage and industrial debris; the transportation of petroleum in tankers, increasing the probability of large oil spills; small oil spills created by large and small vessels, which flush bilge water into the ocean.\n\nFishing has declined due to habitat degradation, overfishing, trawling, bycatch and climate change. Since the growth of global fishing enterprises after the 1950s, intensive fishing has spread from a few concentrated areas to encompass nearly all fisheries. The scraping of the ocean floor in bottom dragging is devastating to coral, sponges and other long-lived species that do not recover quickly. This destruction alters the functioning of the ecosystem and can permanently alter species composition and biodiversity. Bycatch, the capture of unintended species in the course of fishing, is typically returned to the ocean only to die from injuries or exposure. Bycatch represents about a quarter of all marine catch. In the case of shrimp capture, the bycatch is five times larger than the shrimp caught.\n\nIt is believed that melting Arctic ice will cause sea levels to rise and flood coastal areas.\nExtraordinary population growth in the 21st century has placed stress on the planet's ecosystems. For example, on Saint Lucia, harvesting mangrove for timber and clearing for fishing reduced the mangrove forests, resulting in a loss of habitat and spawning grounds for marine life that was unique to the area. These forests also helped to stabilize the coastline. Conservation efforts since the 1980s have partially restored the ecosystem.\n\nAccording to one principle of classification, an emergent coastline is a coastline which has experienced a fall in sea level, because of either a global sea level change, or local uplift. Emergent coastlines are identifiable by the coastal landforms, which are above the high tide mark, such as raised beaches. In contrast, a submergent coastline is one where the sea level has risen, due to a global sea level change, local subsidence, or isostatic rebound. Submergent coastlines are identifiable by their submerged, or \"drowned\" landforms, such as rias (drowned valleys) and fjords.\nAccording to a second principle of classification, a concordant coastline is a coastline where bands of different rock types run parallel to the shore. These rock types are usually of varying resistance, so the coastline forms distinctive landforms, such as coves. Discordant coastlines feature distinctive landforms because the rocks are eroded by ocean waves. The less resistant rocks erode faster, creating inlets or bay; the more resistant rocks erode more slowly, remaining as headlands or outcroppings.\nOther coastal categories:\n\nThe following articles describe some coastal landforms\n\n\nThe following articles describe the various geologic processes that affect a coastal zone:\n\nSome of the animals live along a typical coast. There are animals like puffins, sea turtles and rockhopper penguins. Sea snails and various kinds of barnacles live on the coast and scavenge on food deposited by the sea. Most coastal animals are used to humans in developed areas, such as dolphins and seagulls who eat food thrown for them by tourists. Since the coastal areas are all part of the littoral zone, there is a profusion of marine life found just off-coast.\n\nThere are many kinds of seabirds on the coast. Pelicans and cormorants join up with terns and oystercatchers to forage for fish and shellfish on the coast. There are sea lions on the coast of Wales and other countries.\n\nCoastal areas are famous for their kelp beds. Kelp is a fast-growing seaweed that grows up to a metre a day. Corals and sea anemones are true animals, but live a lifestyle similar to that of plants. Mangroves, seagrasses and salt marsh are important coastal vegetation types in tropical and temperate environments respectively.\n\nShortly before 1951, Lewis Fry Richardson, in researching the possible effect of border lengths on the probability of war, noticed that the Portuguese reported their measured border with Spain to be 987 km, but the Spanish reported it as 1214 km. This was the beginning of the coastline problem, which is a mathematical uncertainty inherent in the measurement of boundaries that are irregular.\n\nThe prevailing method of estimating the length of a border (or coastline) was to lay out \"n\" equal straight-line segments of length \"ℓ\" with dividers on a map or aerial photograph. Each end of the segment must be on the boundary. Investigating the discrepancies in border estimation, Richardson discovered what is now termed the Richardson Effect: the sum of the segments is inversely proportional to the common length of the segments. In effect, the shorter the ruler, the longer the measured border; the Spanish and Portuguese geographers were simply using different-length rulers.\n\nThe result most astounding to Richardson is that, under certain circumstances, as \"ℓ\" approaches zero, the length of the coastline approaches infinity. Richardson had believed, based on Euclidean geometry, that a coastline would approach a fixed length, as do similar estimations of regular geometric figures. For example, the perimeter of a regular polygon inscribed in a circle approaches the circumference with increasing numbers of sides (and decrease in the length of one side). In geometric measure theory such a smooth curve as the circle that can be approximated by small straight segments with a definite limit is termed a rectifiable curve.\n\nMore than a decade after Richardson completed his work, Benoit Mandelbrot developed a new branch of mathematics, fractal geometry, to describe just such non-rectifiable complexes in nature as the infinite coastline. His own definition of the new figure serving as the basis for his study is:\n\nA key property of the fractal is self-similarity; that is, at any scale the same general configuration appears. A coastline is perceived as bays alternating with promontories. In the hypothetical situation that a given coastline has this property of self-similarity, then no matter how greatly any one small section of coastline is magnified, a similar pattern of smaller bays and promontories superimposed on larger bays and promontories appears, right down to the grains of sand. At that scale the coastline appears as a momentarily shifting, potentially infinitely long thread with a stochastic arrangement of bays and promontories formed from the small objects at hand. In such an environment (as opposed to smooth curves) Mandelbrot asserts \"coastline length turns out to be an elusive notion that slips between the fingers of those who want to grasp it.\"\n\nThere are different kinds of fractals. A coastline with the stated property is in \"a first category of fractals, namely curves whose fractal dimension is greater than 1.\" That last statement represents an extension by Mandelbrot of Richardson's thought. Mandelbrot's statement of the Richardson Effect is:\n\nwhere L, coastline length, a function of the measurement unit, ε, is approximated by the expression. F is a constant and D is a parameter that Richardson found depended on the coastline approximated by L. He gave no theoretical explanation but Mandelbrot identified D with a non-integer form of the Hausdorff dimension, later the fractal dimension. Rearranging the right side of the expression obtains:\n\nwhere Fε must be the number of units ε required to obtain L. The fractal dimension is the number of the dimensions of the figure being used to approximate the fractal: 0 for a dot, 1 for a line, 2 for a square. D in the expression is between 1 and 2, for coastlines typically less than 1.5. The broken line measuring the coast does not extend in one direction nor does it represent an area, but is intermediate. It can be interpreted as a thick line or band of width 2ε. More broken coastlines have greater D and therefore L is longer for the same ε. Mandelbrot showed that D is independent of ε.\n\n\n"}

Combe was said to have been dubbed Chalcis because she made bronze weapons (χαλκόν \"chalcon\" being the Greek word for \"bronze\"); the mythological tradition also makes her the first woman to cohabit with a man, and mother of one hundred children.\n\nIn Nonnus' \"Dionysiaca\", Combe is the consort of the Euboean Socus and mother by him of the seven Corybantes. She and her sons get expelled from the island by Socus and move first to Cnossus and then to Athens. The Corybantes return to Euboea after King Cecrops, their host in Athens, kills Socus, but Combe's individual further destiny is not dealt with.

She is also the mother of the Daityas with the sage Kashyapa. She wanted to have a son who would be more powerful than Indra (who had killed her previous children, who tried to murder Indra and so she practiced black magic and kept herself pregnant for one year. Indra used a thunderbolt to splinter the fetus into many pieces, the Maruts. She is also Aditi's sister. Diti is the daughter of Daksha — one of the grandfathers of creation, a son of Brahma, the god of ritual skill and a king. Her mother was Panchajani. She is one of the sixty daughters of Daksha. She is one of the thirteen wives of Kashyapa, a \"prajapati\" and a great sage. Her two most famous sons were the rebirths of Vishnu's gatekeepers Jaya and Vijaya who failed to keep their dharma. They were Hiranyaksha who was slain by Vishnu's Varaha \"avatara\" and Hiranyakashipu who was slain by Vishnu's man-lion, Narasimha \"avatara\". She also had a daughter named Holika who was killed by her own powers. Diti is usually mean and cruel to Kashyapa and Aditi. She is always obsessed with trying to raise the power of demons to its peak. She also hates Aditi's sons who are the gods. She was instrumental to gain control and autonomy over the Gods (Aditi's children). Diti is assisted by her sister Uma.\n\nSeeing Kashyapa's co-wives being blessed with children, Diti too was eager to have a son, so she asked Kashyapa for company.\nThough Kashyapa had acceded to her request, He had asked her to wait for an hour as it was then the time when Shiva and his retinue of ghosts and spirits moved about, a time which was considered inauspicious and unsuited. However Diti, shaken by the passion of love and lust, couldn't wait and she seized Kashyapa by his garments, which was a sign of immodesty. Since Diti's mind was impure, tainted by lust, she would give birth to two unworthy sons who would violate all the ethics (Dharma) and follow the path of Adharma. When Diti felt sorry, Kashyapa consoled her by saying that they would be slain by Lord Vishnu himself and thus be blessed by the Lord's contact in the end. Also, one of her four grandsons by her first son, would be a great devotee of Vishnu and also the noblest man (He is Prahlada). In this way, Jaya and Vijaya were born on this earth to Diti as Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha. In Section 67, \"Adi Parava\" of Mahabharata, it is stated that king Shishupala, the powerful ruler of Chedis, was also an incarnation of Hiranyakasipu, the son of Diti.\n\nBesides great Asura Hiranyakashipu, some other more famous sons of Diti are also mentioned in Adiparava, Mahabharata, as follows:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "197964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197964", "title": "Electron affinity", "text": "Electron affinity\n\nIn chemistry and atomic physics, the electron affinity (\"E\") of an atom or molecule is defined as the amount of energy \"released\" or \"spent\" when an electron is added to a neutral atom or molecule in the gaseous state to form a negative ion.\nIn solid state physics, the electron affinity for a surface is defined somewhat differently (see below).\n\nThis property is measured for atoms and molecules in the gaseous state only, since in a solid or liquid state their energy levels would be changed by contact with other atoms or molecules. A list of the electron affinities was used by Robert S. Mulliken to develop an electronegativity scale for atoms, equal to the average of the electron affinity and ionization potential. Other theoretical concepts that use electron affinity include electronic chemical potential and chemical hardness. Another example, a molecule or atom that has a more positive value of electron affinity than another is often called an electron acceptor and the less positive an electron donor. Together they may undergo charge-transfer reactions.\n\nTo use electron affinities properly, it is essential to keep track of sign. For any reaction that \"releases\" energy, the \"change\" Δ\"E\" in total energy has a negative value and the reaction is called an exothermic process. Electron capture for almost all non-noble gas atoms involves the release of energy and thus are exothermic. The positive values that are listed in tables of \"E\" are amounts or magnitudes. It is the word, \"released\" within the definition \"energy released\" that supplies the negative sign to Δ\"E\". Confusion arises in mistaking \"E\" for a change in energy, Δ\"E\", in which case the positive values listed in tables would be for an endo- not exo-thermic process. The relation between the two is \"E\" = −Δ\"E\"(attach).\n\nHowever, if the value assigned to \"E\" is negative, the negative sign implies a reversal of direction, and energy is \"required\" to attach an electron. In this case, the electron capture is an endothermic process and the relationship, \"E\" = −Δ\"E\"(attach) is still valid. Negative values typically arise for the capture of a second electron, but also for the nitrogen atom.\n\nThe usual expression for calculating \"E\" when an electron is attached is\n\nThis expression does follow the convention Δ\"X\" = \"X\"(final) − \"X\"(initial) since −Δ\"E\" = −(\"E\"(final) − \"E\"(initial)) = \"E\"(initial) − \"E\"(final).\n\nEquivalently, electron affinity can also be defined as the amount of energy \"required\" to detach an electron from a singly charged negative ion, i.e. the energy change for the process\n\nIf the same table is employed for the forward and reverse reactions, \"without switching signs\", care must be taken to apply the correct definition to the corresponding direction, attachment (release) or detachment (require). Since almost all detachments \"(require +)\" an amount of energy listed on the table, those detachment reactions are endothermic, or Δ\"E\"(detach) > 0.\n\nAlthough \"E\" varies greatly across the periodic table, some patterns emerge. Generally, nonmetals have more positive \"E\" than metals. Atoms whose anions are more stable than neutral atoms have a greater \"E\". Chlorine most strongly attracts extra electrons; mercury most weakly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been conclusively measured, so they may or may not have slightly negative values.\n\n\"E\" generally increases across a period (row) in the periodic table prior to reaching group 18. This is caused by the filling of the valence shell of the atom; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell and therefore is more stable. In group 18, the valence shell is full, meaning that added electrons are unstable, tending to be ejected very quickly.\n\nCounterintuitively, \"E\" does \"not\" decrease when progressing down the rows of the periodic table, as can be clearly seen in the group 2 data. Thus, electron affinity follows the same \"left-right\" trend as electronegativity, but not the \"up-down\" trend.\n\nThe following data are quoted in kJ/mol.\n\nThe electron affinity of molecules is a complicated function of their electronic structure.\nFor instance the electron affinity for benzene is negative, as is that of naphthalene, while those of anthracene, phenanthrene and pyrene are positive. \"In silico\" experiments show that the electron affinity of hexacyanobenzene surpasses that of fullerene.\n\nIn the field of solid state physics, the electron affinity is defined differently than in chemistry and atomic physics. For a semiconductor-vacuum interface (that is, the surface of a semiconductor), electron affinity, typically denoted by \"E\" or \"χ\", is defined as the energy obtained by moving an electron from the vacuum just outside the semiconductor to the bottom of the conduction band just inside the semiconductor:\nIn an intrinsic semiconductor at absolute zero, this concept is functionally analogous to the chemistry definition of electron affinity, since an added electron will spontaneously go to the bottom of the conduction band. At nonzero temperature, and for other materials (metals, semimetals, heavily doped semiconductors), the analogy does not hold since an added electron will instead go to the Fermi level on average. In any case, the value of the electron affinity of a solid substance is very different from the chemistry and atomic physics electron affinity value for an atom of the same substance in gas phase. For example, a silicon crystal surface has electron affinity 4.05 eV, whereas an isolated silicon atom has electron affinity 1.39 eV.\n\nThe electron affinity of a surface is closely related to, but distinct from, its work function. The work function is the thermodynamic work that can be obtained by reversibly, isothermally moving an electron from the vacuum to the material; this thermodynamic electron goes to the \"Fermi level\" on average, not the conduction band edge: formula_2. While the work function of a semiconductor can be changed by doping, the electron affinity ideally does not change with doping and so it is closer to being a material constant. However, like work function the electron affinity does depend on the surface termination (crystal face, surface chemistry, etc.) and is strictly a surface property.\n\nIn semiconductor physics, the primary use of the electron affinity is not actually in the analysis of semiconductor–vacuum surfaces, but rather in heuristic electron affinity rules for estimating the band bending that occurs at the interface of two materials, in particular metal–semiconductor junctions and semiconductor heterojunctions.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the electron affinity may become negative. Often negative electron affinity is desired to obtain efficient cathodes that can supply electrons to the vacuum with little energy loss. The observed electron yield as a function of various parameters such as bias voltage or illumination conditions can be used to describe these structures with band diagrams in which the electron affinity is one parameter. For one illustration of the apparent effect of surface termination on electron emission, see Figure 3 in Marchywka Effect.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36974123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36974123", "title": "Fuel economy in aircraft", "text": "Fuel economy in aircraft\n\nFuel economy in aircraft is a measure of how much fuel an aircraft, or a fleet of aircraft of mixed types, needs to operate in relation to a service provided (i.e. number of passengers or ton of freight) and the distance between points of travel. It can be expressed in several ways, for example by the litres of fuel consumed per passenger per kilometer.\n\nA powered aircraft counters its weight through aerodynamic lift and counters its aerodynamic drag with thrust. The aircraft's maximum range is determined by the level of efficiency with which thrust can be applied to overcome the aerodynamic drag.\n\nA subfield of fluid dynamics, aerodynamics studies the physics of a body moving through the air. As lift and drag are functions of air speed, their relationships are major determinants of an aircraft's design efficiency.\n\nAircraft efficiency is augmented by maximizing lift-to-drag ratio, which is attained by minimizing parasitic drag and lift-generated induced drag, the two components of aerodynamic drag. As parasitic drag increases and induced drag decreases with speed, there is an optimum speed where the sum of both is minimal; this is the best glide ratio. For powered aircraft, the optimum glide ratio has to be balanced with thrust efficiency.\n\nParasitic drag is constituted by form drag and skin-friction drag, and grows with the square of the speed in the drag equation. The form drag is minimized by having the smallest frontal area and by streamlining the aircraft for a low drag coefficient, while skin friction is proportional to the body's surface area and can be reduced by maximizing laminar flow.\n\nInduced drag can be reduced by decreasing the size of the airframe, fuel and payload weight, and by increasing the wing aspect ratio or by using wingtip devices at the cost of increased structure weight.\n\nBy increasing efficiency, a lower cruise-speed augments the range and reduces the environmental impact of aviation; however, a higher cruise-speed allows more revenue passenger miles flown per day.\n\nJet engine efficiency increases with velocity because the speed difference between the flight and the exhaust is lower. However, above the drag divergence Mach number, the aerodynamic drag on the airframe overwhelms this effect because supersonic shockwaves begin to form, greatly increasing drag and needing supercritical airfoil designs for transonic flight.\n\nFor supersonic flight, drag increases at Mach 1.0 but decreases again after the transition. With a specifically designed aircraft, such as the (in development) Aerion AS2, the Mach 1.1 range at 3,700 nmi is 3700/5300*100round0% of the maximum range of 5,300 nmi at Mach 0.95, but increases to 4,750 nmi at Mach 1.4 for 4750/5300*100round0% before falling again.\n\nWingtip devices increase the effective wing-aspect ratio, lowering lift-induced drag caused by wingtip vortices and improving the lift-to-drag ratio without increasing the wingspan. (Wingspan is limited by the available width in the ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code.) Airbus installed wingtip fences on its planes since the A310-300 in 1985, and Sharklet blended-winglets for the A320 were launched during the November 2009 Dubai air show. Their installation adds but offers a 3.5% fuel burn reduction on flights over .\n\nAs the weight indirectly generates lift-induced drag, its minimization leads to better aircraft efficiency. For a given payload, a lighter airframe generates a lower drag. Minimizing weight can be achieved through the airframe's configuration, materials science and construction methods. To obtain a longer range, a larger fuel fraction of the maximum takeoff weight is needed, adversely affecting efficiency.\n\nThe deadweight of the airframe and fuel is non-payload that must be lifted to altitude and kept aloft, contributing to fuel consumption. A reduction in airframe weight enables the use of smaller, lighter engines. The weight savings in both allow for a lighter fuel load for a given range and payload. A rule-of-thumb is that a reduction in fuel consumption of about 0.75% results from each 1% reduction in weight.\n\nThe 84-ton maximum payload of a modern Airbus A380 represents 84/575*100round1% of its 575-ton maximum take-off weight. There remains considerable room for future improvements in weight reduction. The weight of an aircraft can be reduced by using light-weight materials such as titanium, carbon fiber and other composite plastics. Expensive materials may be used if the reduction of mass justifies the price of materials through improved fuel efficiency over the aircraft's lifetime. Any improvements in fuel efficiency reduce the amount of fuel an aircraft must carry, which reduces the take-off weight of the aircraft and provides further gains in fuel efficiency. For example, the Airbus A380 design includes multiple light-weight materials. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner was the first major commercial airplane to have a composite fuselage, composite wings, and use composites in most other airframe components.\n\nFor long-haul flights, the airplane needs to carry additional fuel, leading to higher fuel consumption. Above a certain distance it becomes more fuel-efficient to make a halfway stop to refuel despite the energy losses in descent and climb. For example, a Boeing 777-300 reaches the tipping point at . It is more fuel-efficient to make a non-stop flight below this distance and to make a stop when covering a longer total distance.\n\nVery long non-stop passenger flights suffer from the weight penalty of the extra fuel required, which means limiting the number of available seats to compensate. For such flights, the critical fiscal factor is the quantity of fuel burnt per seat-nautical mile. For these reasons the world's longest commercial flights were cancelled . An example is Singapore Airlines' former New York to Singapore flight, which could carry only 100 passengers (all business class) on the flight. According to an industry analyst, \"It [was] pretty much a fuel tanker in the air.\"\n\nIn the late 2000s/early 2010s, rising fuel prices coupled with the Great Recession caused the cancellation of many ultra-long haul, non-stop flights. This included the services provided by Singapore Airlines from Singapore to both Newark and Los Angeles that was ended in late 2013. But as fuel prices have since decreased and more fuel efficient aircraft have come into service, many ultra-long haul routes have been reinstated or newly scheduled (see Longest flights).\n\nTo get thrust, an aircraft engine is either a shaft engine – piston engine or turboprop, with its efficiency measured by its brake-specific fuel consumption – coupled with a propeller having its own propulsive efficiency; or a jet engine with its efficiency measured by its thrust-specific fuel consumption.\n\nTurboprops have an optimum speed below . This is less than jets used by major airlines today, but there is reduced drag at the lower speed.\n\nJet fuel cost and emissions reduction have renewed interest in the propfan concept for jetliners with an emphasis on engine/airframe efficiency that might come into service beyond the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350XWB. For instance, Airbus has patented aircraft designs with twin rear-mounted counter-rotating propfans. Propfans are a more fuel-efficient technology than jet engines or turboprops. NASA has conducted an Advanced Turboprop Project (ATP), where they researched a variable-pitch propfan that produced less noise and achieved high speeds.\n\nAt constant propulsive efficiency, the maximum range speed is when the ratio between velocity and drag is minimal, while maximum endurance is attained at the best lift-to-drag ratio.\n\nAir density decreases with altitude, thus lowering drag, assuming the aircraft maintains a constant equivalent airspeed. This means an aircraft may be more efficient at higher altitude. With increasing altitude, air pressure and temperature both decrease, causing the maximum power or thrust of aircraft engines to reduce. In a piston engine, this trend towards decline in maximum power can be mitigated by installation of a turbocharger. Decreasing air temperature with altitude increases thermal efficiency.\n\nFuel economy in air transport comes from aircraft fuel efficiency combined with airline efficiency: seating configuration, passenger load factor and air cargo. For instance, over the transatlantic route, the most-active intercontinental market, the average fuel consumption in 2017 was 34 pax-km per L ( per passenger). The most fuel-efficient airline was Norwegian Air Shuttle with 44 pax-km/L ( per passenger), thanks to its fuel-efficient Boeing 787-8, a high 85% passenger load factor and a high density of 1.36 seat/m due to a low 9% premium seating. On the other side, the least efficient was British Airways at 27 pax-km/L ( per passenger), using fuel-inefficient Boeing 747-400s with a low density of 0.75 seat/m due to a high 25% premium seating, in spite of a high 82% load factor.\n\nIn 2016, over the transpacific routes, the average fuel consumption was 31 pax-km per L ( per passenger). The most fuel-efficient were Hainan Airlines and ANA with 36 pax-km/L ( per passenger) while Qantas was the least efficient at 22 pax-km/L ( per passenger).\nKey drivers for efficiency were the air freight share for 48%, seating density for 24%, aircraft fuel burn for 16% and passenger load factor for 12%.\n\nMSCI ranked Ryanair as the lowest-emissions-intensity airline in its ACWI index with 75 g -e/revenue passenger kilometre in 2014 – below Easyjet at 82 g, the average at 123 g and Lufthansa at 132 g – by using high-density 189-seat Boeing 737-800s. In 2015 Ryanair emitted 8.64 Bn t of for 545,034 sectors flown: 8638838/545034round2 t per average sector (or 8638838/545034*14/44round2 t of fuel: 8638838/545034*14/44/1.249round2 kg/km) representing 8638838/90555.521round0 kg per 90.6 million passengers (8638838/90555.521*14/44round1 kg of fuel: 8638838/90555.521*14/44/12.49/0.8round2 L/100 km or 8638838/90555.521/1.249round0 g /km).\n\nThe Aeroflot Group fuel consumption is 22.9g/ASK, or per seat, per passenger at its 81.5% load factor.\nIn 2016, Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon consumed 4,571,000 tonnes of fuel to transport 123,478 million revenue passenger kilometers, or 37 g/RPK, 25% better than in 1998: .\nFrom 2010 to 2012, the most fuel-efficient US domestic airline was Alaska Airlines, due partly to its regional affiliate Horizon Air flying turboprops – it would otherwise be second to Spirit Airlines.\n\nAirbus presented the following measures to save fuel, in its example of an A330 flying on a route like Bangkok–Tokyo: direct routing saves fuel by flying less; more fuel is consumed if flying below optimum altitude without vertical flight profile optimization; cruising 0.01 mach above optimum consumes more fuel; more fuel on board consumes more fuel while of unused potable water consumes more fuel.\n\nOperational procedures can save fuel for every 10-minute reduction in use of the Auxiliary power unit (APU), with a reduced flap approach and with reduced thrust reversal on landing. Maintenance can also save fuel: more fuel is consumed without an engine wash schedule; with a slat rigging gap, with a spoiler rigging gap, and with a damaged door seal.\n\nModern jet aircraft have twice the fuel efficiency of the earliest jet airliners. Late 1950s piston airliners like the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation and DC-7 were 1% to 28% more energy-intensive than 1990s jet airliners which cruise 40 to 80% faster. The early jet airliners were designed at a time when air crew labor costs were higher relative to fuel costs. Despite the high fuel consumption, because fuel was inexpensive in that era the higher speed resulted in favorable economical returns since crew costs and amortization of capital investment in the aircraft could be spread over more seat-miles flown per day.\nProductivity including speed went from around 150 ASK/MJ*km/h for the 1930s DC-3 to 550 for the L-1049 in the 1950s, and from 200 for the DH-106 Comet 3 to 900 for the 1990s B737-800.\n\nToday's turboprop airliners have better fuel-efficiency than current jet airliners, in part because of their lower cruising speed and propellers that are more efficient than those of the 1950s-era piston-powered airlines.\n\nJet aircraft efficiency is improving: between 1960 and 2000 there was a 55% overall fuel-efficiency gain (as compared to the Boeing 707). Most of the improvements in efficiency were gained in the first decade when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use. Between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4%. Nonetheless, from the 1960s to the present, total fleet emissions of the greenhouse gas have outpaced efficiency gains, due to growth in the air-travel market.\n\nConcorde, a supersonic transport, managed about 17 passenger-miles to the Imperial gallon, which is 16.7 L/100 km per passenger; similar to a business jet, but much worse than a subsonic turbofan aircraft. Airbus states a fuel rate consumption of their A380 at less than 3 L/100 km per passenger (78 passenger-miles per US gallon); however this is for an unspecified number and configuration of seats. The maximum configuration is 850 economy passengers, but with a typical 525-seat multi-class configuration the fuel consumption is \"comparable to that of a B747-400ER and even about 15% worse than a B777-300ER on a passenger-mile basis.\"\n\nThe aviation fuel density used is 6.7 lb/USgal or 0.8 kg/l.\n\nFor flights of :\nFor flights of \nFor flights of :\nFor flights of . The larger end of this range includes transatlantic flights (e.g. New York JFK – London-Heathrow is 3,000 nmi).\n\nFor flights of . This includes transpacific flights (e.g. Hong Kong international – San Francisco International is 6,000 nmi).\n\nFor comparison, a Volvo bus 9700 averages per seat for 63 seats. In highway travel an average auto has the potential for per seat (assuming 4 seats) and for a 5-seat 2014 Toyota Prius, . While this shows the capabilities of the vehicles, the load factors (percentage of seats occupied) may differ between personal use (commonly just the driver in the car) and societal averages for long-distance auto use, and among those of particular airlines.\n\nFor private aircraft in general aviation, the current official record (FAI \"Efficiency Aircraft\") is 37 km/kg fuel or 3.7 L/100 km in a Monnett Sonerai.\n\nNASA and Boeing flight-tested a blended wing body (BWB) X-48B demonstrator from August 2012 to April 2013. This design provides greater fuel efficiency, since the whole craft produces lift, not just the wings. The BWB concept offers advantages in structural, aerodynamic and operating efficiencies over today's more-conventional fuselage-and-wing designs. These features translate into greater range, fuel economy, reliability and life-cycle savings, as well as lower manufacturing costs. NASA has created a cruise efficient STOL (CESTOL) concept.\n\nFraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Applied Materials Research (IFAM) have researched a sharkskin-imitating paint that would reduce drag through a riblet effect. Aviation is a major potential application for new technologies such as aluminium metal foam and nanotechnology.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) technology roadmap envisions improvements in aircraft configuration and aerodynamics. It projects the following reductions in fuel consumption:\n\nToday's tube-and-wing configuration could remain in use until the 2030s due to drag reductions from active flutter suppression for slender flexible-wings and natural and hybrid laminar flow.\nLarge, ultra high bypass engines will need upswept gull wings or overwing nacelles as Pratt & Whitney continue to develop its geared turbofan to save a projected 10–15% of fuel costs by the mid-2020s.\nNASA indicates this configuration could gain up to 45% with advanced aerodynamics, structures and geared turbofans, but longer term suggests savings of up to 50% by 2025 and 60% by 2030 with new ultra-efficient configurations and propulsion architectures: hybrid wing body, truss-braced wing, lifting body designs, embedded engines, and boundary-layer ingestion.\nBy 2030 hybrid-electric architectures may be ready for 100 seaters and distributed propulsion with tighter integration of airframe may enable further efficiency and emissions improvements.\n\nResearch projects such as Boeing's ecoDemonstrator program have sought to identify ways of improving the fuel economy of commercial aircraft operations. The U.S. government has encouraged such research through grant programs, including the FAA's Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) program, and NASA's Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project.\n\nMultiple concepts are projected to reduce fuel consumption:\n\nThe growth of air travel outpaces its fuel-economy improvements and corresponding emissions, compromising climate sustainability. Although low-cost carriers' higher seat-density increases fuel economy and lowers greenhouse gas emissions per-passenger-kilometer, the lower airfares cause a rebound effect of more flights and larger overall emissions. The tourism industry could shift emphasis to emissions eco-efficiency in per unit of revenue or profit instead of fuel economy, favoring shorter trips and ground transportation over flying long journeys to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n"}

After failing to pay the Texas state franchise tax, IHST lost its charter in 1989, and was later rebranded as the Institute for Energy Research, or IER, under the presidency of Robert L. Bradley Jr., the former director of public policy analysis for Enron. IER began by distributing quarterly reports to a small but growing list of donors in the early 1990s and eventually expanded its publishing capabilities to include highly publicized studies. It was not until 2001 when Bradley secured funding to make IER a full-time organization. In 2007, IER was moved to Washington, D.C. where it transformed itself into an energy think tank producing research and analysis on global energy markets.\n\nIn 2009, an article in \"Mother Jones\" magazine said IER was among the most prominent organizations questioning the existence and extent of anthropogenic climate change.\n\nThe Institute's CEO and founder, Robert L.

He was the son of lawyer John Schjelderup Giæver (1864–1914) and his wife Thyra Høegh (1879–1954). He was the great-great-great-grandson of Jens Holmboe.\n\nJohn Schjelderup Giæver married Oddbjørg Jacobsen in March 1940 and they had a son in April the same year. However, the marriage was dissolved. Giæver married Anna Margrethe Gløersen in 1948; this time they had a daughter, born 1954.\n\nHe took his secondary education in Trondheim in 1920, and then moved back to Tromsø. He started a newspaper career, as sub-editor of \"Tromsø Stiftstidende\" from 1921 to 1922. He was editor-in-chief in \"Vesteraalens Avis\" from 1922 to 1928 and \"Tromsø Stiftstidende\" from 1928 to 1929. He lived as a trapper in north-eastern Greenland from 1929 to 1934. In 1935 he was hired as secretary for \"Norges Svalbard- og Ishavsundersøkelser\", the Norwegian institution for exploration of Svalbard and the Arctic Sea, later renamed into the Norwegian Polar Institute.\n\nDuring World War II, he first fled to London where he worked as a secretary for the exiled government. From 1941 to 1944, he served with the Royal Norwegian Air Force-in-exile at Little Norway, Canada. In 1944, with the rank of Major, he was sent to Northern Norway to participate in the successful liberation from Nazi occupation. In 1947 he returned to the Norwegian Polar Institute as secretary, and from 1948 to 1960 he was office manager. However, he was still involved in the field as well, leading the wintering party of the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition from 1949 to 1952.\n\nGiæver published several books. His literary career began with \"Illgjerningsmand\" (\"A Misdeeder\") (1921), which was translated into German in 1923. His book \"Maudheim. To år i Antarktis\" (1952), describing the Antarctic Expedition was translated into English, French, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Finnish, German and Croatian. From 1955 on he renewed his literary authorship with numerous books of documentary and partly autobiographical topics, covering Arctic trapping, fishing and warfare.\n\nOther books include \"Ishavets glade borgere\" (1956); \"Langt der oppe mot nord\" (1958), \"Rabagaster under polarstjernen\" (1959), \"Fra min barndoms elv til fjerne veidemarker\" (1960), \"Fra Little Norway til Karasjok\" (1964), \"Med rev bak øret\" (1965), \"Dyretråkk og fugletrekk på 74° nord\" (1967), \"Lys og skygger i sjøgata\" (1969), \"Den gang jeg drog av sted\" (1970) and \"Soldøgn og mørketid\" (1971).\n\nGiæver was awarded the Maudheim medal in 1952 and the Royal Geographical Society's Founder's Gold Medal in 1956, both for his leadership in the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition.

{"id": "39696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39696", "title": "Oak", "text": "Oak\n\nAn oak is a tree or shrub in the genus Quercus (; Latin \"oak tree\") of the beech family, Fagaceae. There are approximately 600 extant species of oaks. The common name \"oak\" also appears in the names of species in related genera, notably \"Lithocarpus\" (stone oaks), as well as in those of unrelated species such as \"Grevillea robusta\" (silky oaks) and the Casuarinaceae (she-oaks). The genus \"Quercus\" is native to the Northern Hemisphere, and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa. North America contains the largest number of oak species, with approximately 90 occurring in the United States, while Mexico has 160 species of which 109 are endemic. The second greatest center of oak diversity is China, which contains approximately 100 species.\nOaks have spirally arranged leaves, with lobate margins in many species; some have serrated leaves or entire leaves with smooth margins. Many deciduous species are marcescent, not dropping dead leaves until spring. In spring, a single oak tree produces both male flowers (in the form of catkins) and small female flowers. The fruit is a nut called an acorn or oak nut borne in a cup-like structure known as a cupule; each acorn contains one seed (rarely two or three) and takes 6–18 months to mature, depending on their species. The acorns and leaves contain tannic acid, which helps to guard from fungi and insects. The live oaks are distinguished for being evergreen, but are not actually a distinct group and instead are dispersed across the genus.\n\nThe oak tree is a flowering plant. Oaks may be divided into two genera (sometimes referred to as subgenera) and a number of sections:\n\nThe genus \"Quercus\" is divided into the following sections:\n\n\nInterspecific hybridization is quite common among oaks but usually between species within the same section only and most common in the white oak group (subgenus \"Quercus\", section \"Quercus\"; see List of \"Quercus\" species). Inter-section hybrids, except between species of sections \"Quercus\" and \"Mesobalanus\", are unknown. Recent systematic studies appear to confirm a high tendency of \"Quercus\" species to hybridize because of a combination of factors. White oaks are unable to discriminate against pollination by other species in the same section. Because they are wind pollinated and they have weak internal barriers to hybridization, hybridization produces functional seeds and fertile hybrid offspring. Ecological stresses, especially near habitat margins, can also cause a breakdown of mate recognition as well as a reduction of male function (pollen quantity and quality) in one parent species.\n\nFrequent hybridization among oaks has consequences for oak populations around the world; most notably, hybridization has produced large populations of hybrids with copious amounts of introgression, and the evolution of new species. Frequent hybridization and high levels of introgression have caused different species in the same populations to share up to 50% of their genetic information. Having high rates of hybridization and introgression produces genetic data that often does not differentiate between two clearly morphologically distinct species, but instead differentiates populations. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain how oak species are able to remain morphologically and ecologically distinct with such high levels of gene flow, but the phenomenon is still largely a mystery to botanists.\n\nThe Fagaceae, or beech family, to which the oaks belong, is a very slow evolving clade compared to other angiosperms, and the patterns of hybridization and introgression in \"Quercus\" pose a great challenge to the concept of a species since a species is often defined as a group of “actually or potentially interbreeding populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups.” By this definition, many species of \"Quercus\" would be lumped together according to their geographic and ecological habitat, despite clear distinctions in morphology and, to a large extent, genetic data.\n\nOak wood has a density of about creating great strength and hardness. The wood is very resistant to insect and fungal attack because of its high tannin content. It also has very appealing grain markings, particularly when quartersawn. Oak planking was common on high status Viking longships in the 9th and 10th centuries. The wood was hewn from green logs, by axe and wedge, to produce radial planks, similar to quarter-sawn timber. Wide, quarter-sawn boards of oak have been prized since the Middle Ages for use in interior panelling of prestigious buildings such as the debating chamber of the House of Commons in London and in the construction of fine furniture. Oak wood, from \"Quercus robur\" and \"Quercus petraea\", was used in Europe for the construction of ships, especially naval men of war, until the 19th century, and was the principal timber used in the construction of European timber-framed buildings. Today oak wood is still commonly used for furniture making and flooring, timber frame buildings, and veneer production. \n\nBarrels in which wines, sherry, and spirits such as brandy, Irish whiskey, Scotch whisky and Bourbon whiskey are aged are made from European and American oak, with single barrel whiskey fetching a premium. The use of oak in wine can add many different dimensions to wine based on the type and style of the oak. Oak barrels, which may be charred before use, contribute to the colour, taste, and aroma of the contents, imparting a desirable oaky vanillin flavour to these drinks. The great dilemma for wine producers is to choose between French and American oakwoods. French oaks (\"Quercus robur\", \"Q. petraea\") give the wine greater refinement and are chosen for the best wines since they increase the price compared to those aged in American oak wood. American oak contributes greater texture and resistance to ageing, but produces more powerful wine bouquets. Oak wood chips are used for smoking fish, meat, cheeses, and other foods.\nJapanese oak is used in the making of professional drums from the manufacturer Yamaha Drums. The higher density of oak gives the drum a brighter and louder tone compared to traditional drum materials such as maple and birch. In hill states of India, besides fuelwood and timber, the local people use oak wood for making agricultural implements. The leaves are used as fodder during lean period and bedding for livestock.\nThe bark of the cork oak is used to produce wine stoppers (corks). This species grows in the Mediterranean Sea region, with Portugal, Spain, Algeria, and Morocco producing most of the world's supply.\n\nOf the North American oaks, the northern red oak is one of the most prized of the red oak group for lumber, much of which is marketed as red oak regardless of the species of origin. It is not good for outdoor use due to its open capillaries unless the wood is treated. If the wood is properly treated with preservatives, it will not rot as quickly as cured white oak heartwood. The closed cell structure of white oaks prevents them from absorbing preservatives. With northern red oak, one can blow air through an end grain piece 10 inches long to make bubbles come out in a glass of water. These openings give fungus easy access when the finish deteriorates. Shumard oak, a member of the red oak subgenus, provides timber which is described as \"mechanically superior\" to northern red oak. Cherrybark oak is another type of red oak which provides excellent timber.\n\nThe standard for the lumber of the white oak group – all of which is marketed as white oak – is the \"Quercus alba\". White oak is often used to make wine barrels. The wood of the deciduous pedunculate oak and sessile oak accounts for most of the European oak production, but evergreen species, such as Holm oak and cork oak also produce valuable timber.\n\nThe bark of the white oak is dried and used in medical preparations. Oak bark is also rich in tannin, and is used by tanners for tanning leather. Acorns are used for making flour or roasted for acorn coffee.\n\nOak galls were used for centuries as a main ingredient in iron gall ink, a kind of manuscript ink, harvested at a specific time of year. In Korea, oak bark is used to make shingles for traditional roof construction.\n\nOaks are keystone species in a wide range of habitats from Mediterranean semi-desert to subtropical rainforest. For example, oak trees are important components of hardwood forests, and certain species are particularly known to grow in associations with members of the Ericaceae in oak–heath forests. A number of kinds of truffles, including the two well known varieties, the black Périgord truffle and the white Piedmont truffle, have symbiotic relationships with oak trees. Similarly many other mushrooms such as \"Ramaria flavosaponaria\" also associate with oaks. The European pied flycatcher is an example of an animal species that often depends upon oak trees.\n\nMany species of oaks are under threat of extinction in the wild, largely due to land use changes, livestock grazing and unsustainable harvesting. For example, over the past 200 years, large areas of oak forest in the highlands of Mexico, Central America and the northern Andes have been cleared for coffee plantations and cattle ranching. There is a continuing threat to these forests from exploitation for timber, fuelwood and charcoal. In the USA, entire oak ecosystems have declined due to a combination of factors still imperfectly known, but thought to include fire suppression, increased consumption of acorns by growing mammal populations, herbivory of seedlings, and introduced pests. In a recent survey, 78 wild oak species have been identified as being in danger of extinction, from a global total of over 500 species. The proportion under threat may be much higher in reality, as there is insufficient information about over 300 species, making it near impossible to form any judgement of their status.\n\nIn the Himalayan region of India, oak forests are being invaded by pine forests due to the increase in temperature. The associated species of pine forest may cross frontiers and become new elements of the oak forests.\n\nIn eastern North America, rare species of oak trees include scarlet oak (\"Quercus coccinea\"), chinkapin oak (\"Quercus muehlenbergii\"), and post oak (\"Quercus stellata\").\n\nThe mature trees shed varying numbers of acorns annually. Scientists suggest that shedding excess numbers allows the oaks to satiate nut gathering species, improving the chances of germination. Every four to ten years, certain oak populations will synchronize to produce almost no acorns at all, only to rain them down excessively the following year, known as a \"mast\" year. The year preceding the mast year is thought to starve off the mammal populations feeding on the supply, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the overproduction in the mast year that follows. This is necessary to the survival of any given oak species, as only one in 10,000 acorns results in an eventual tree.\n\nBeginning November 1, 2011, a project began to sequence the entire oak genome. The goal of the project is to create a high resolution sequence of the Quercus robur genome, and to study genetic diversity by comparison of the genomes of different species. Current research has compiled genomic data from many different sources and techniques to create a genome map with 89% coverage of the genome. The project is still in the process of annotating this genome.\n\nSudden oak death (\"Phytophthora ramorum\") is a water mould that can kill oaks within just a few weeks. Oak wilt, caused by the fungus \"Ceratocystis fagacearum\" (a fungus closely related to Dutch elm disease), is also a lethal disease of some oaks, particularly the red oaks (the white oaks can be infected but generally live longer). Other dangers include wood-boring beetles, as well as root rot in older trees which may not be apparent on the outside, often being discovered only when the trees come down in a strong gale. Oak apples are galls on oaks made by the gall wasp. The female kermes scale causes galls to grow on kermes oak. Oaks are used as food plants by the larvae of Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species such as the gypsy moth, \"Lymantria dispar\", which can defoliate oak and other broadleaved tree species in North America.\n\nA considerable number of galls are found on oak leaves, buds, flowers, roots, etc. Examples are oak artichoke gall, oak marble gall, oak apple gall, knopper gall, and spangle gall.\n\nA number of species of fungus cause powdery mildew on oak species. In Europe the species \"Erysiphe alphitoides\" is the most common cause.\n\nA new and yet little understood disease of mature oaks, acute oak decline, has been reported in parts of the UK since 2009.\n\nOak processionary moth (\"Thaumetopoea processionea\") has become a serious threat in the UK since 2006. The caterpillars of this species defoliate the trees, and are hazardous to human health; their bodies are covered with poisonous hairs which can cause rashes and respiratory problems.\n\nIn California, oaks are affected by the fungal disease Foamy bark canker.\n\nThe leaves and acorns of the oak tree are poisonous to cattle, horses, sheep, and goats in large amounts due to the toxin tannic acid, and cause kidney damage and gastroenteritis. Symptoms of poisoning include lack of appetite, depression, constipation, diarrhea (which may contain blood), blood in urine, and colic. The exception to livestock and oak toxicity is the domestic pig, which may be fed entirely on acorns in the right conditions, and has traditionally been pastured in oak woodlands (such as the Spanish \"dehesa\" and the English system of pannage) for hundreds of years.\n\nAcorns are also edible to humans, after leaching of the tannins.\n\nThe oak is a common symbol of strength and endurance and has been chosen as the national tree of many countries. Already an ancient Germanic symbol (in the form of the Donar Oak, for instance), certainly since the early nineteenth century, it stands for the nation of Germany and oak branches are thus displayed on some German coins, both of the former Deutsche Mark and the current Euro currency. In 2004 the Arbor Day Foundation held a vote for the official National Tree of the United States of America. In November 2004, the United States Congress passed legislation designating the oak as America's National Tree.\n\nOther countries have also designated the oak as their national tree including Bulgaria, Cyprus (Golden Oak), England, Estonia, France, Germany, Moldova, Jordan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, and Wales.\n\nThe oak is the emblem of County Londonderry in Northern Ireland, as a vast amount of the county was covered in forests of the tree until relatively recently. The name of the county comes from the city of Derry, which originally in Irish was known as \"Doire\" meaning \"oak\".\n\nThe Irish County Kildare derives its name from the town of Kildare which originally in Irish was \"Cill Dara\" meaning the Church of the Oak or Oak Church.\n\nIowa designated the oak as its official state tree in 1961; and the White Oak is the state tree of Connecticut, Illinois and Maryland. The Northern Red Oak is the provincial tree of Prince Edward Island, as well as the state tree of New Jersey. The Live Oak is the state tree of Georgia, USA.\n\nThe oak is a national symbol from the Basque Country, specially in the province of Biscay. \n\nThe oak is a symbol of the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area; the coat-of-arms and flag of Oakland, California feature the oak and the logo of the East Bay Regional Park District is an oak leaf. \n\nThe coat-of-arms of Vest-Agder, Norway, and Blekinge, Sweden, features oak trees. \n\nThe coat-of-arms of the municipality Eigersund, Norway features an oak leaf. \n\nOak leaves are traditionally an important part of German Army regalia.\nThe Nazi party used the traditional German eagle, standing atop of a swastika inside a wreath of oak leaves. It is also known as the Iron Eagle.\nDuring the Third Reich of Nazi Germany, oak leaves were used for military valor decoration on the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross.\nThey also symbolize rank in the United States Armed Forces. A gold oak leaf indicates an O-4 (Major or Lt. Commander), whereas a silver oak leaf indicates an O-5 (Lt. Colonel or Commander). Arrangements of oak leaves, acorns and sprigs indicate different branches of the United States Navy Staff corps officers. Oak leaves are embroidered onto the covers (hats) worn by field grade officers and flag officers in the United States armed services.\n\nIf a member of the United States Army or Air Force earns multiple awards of the same medal, then instead of wearing a ribbon or medal for each award, he or she wears one metal representation of an \"oak leaf cluster\" attached to the appropriate ribbon for each subsequent award.\n\nThe oak tree is used as a symbol by a number of political parties. It is the symbol of Toryism (on account of the Royal Oak) and the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, and formerly of the Progressive Democrats in Ireland and the Democrats of the Left in Italy. In the cultural arena, the oakleaf is the symbol of the National Trust (UK), The Woodland Trust, and The Royal Oak Foundation.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the oak is the tree sacred to Zeus, king of the gods. In Zeus's oracle in Dodona, Epirus, the sacred oak was the centerpiece of the precinct, and the priests would divine the pronouncements of the god by interpreting the rustling of the oak's leaves.\n\nIn Baltic and Slavic mythology, the oak is the sacred tree of Latvian Pērkons, Lithuanian Perkūnas, Prussian Perkūns and Slavic Perun, the god of thunder and one of the most important deities in the Baltic and Slavic pantheons.\n\nIn Celtic polytheism, the name of the oak tree was part of the Proto-Celtic word for 'druid': \"*derwo-weyd-\" > \"*druwid-\" ; however, Proto-Celtic \"*derwo-\" (and \"*dru-\") can also be adjectives for 'strong' and 'firm', so Ranko Matasovic interprets that \"*druwid-\" may mean 'strong knowledge'. As in other Indo-European faiths, Taranis, being a thunder god, was associated with the oak tree. The Indo-Europeans worshiped the oak and connected it with a thunder or lightning god; \"tree\" and \"drus\" may also be cognate with \"Druid,\" the Celtic priest to whom the oak was sacred. There has even been a study that shows that oaks are more likely to be struck by lightning than any other tree of the same height.\n\nIn Norse mythology, the oak was sacred to the thunder god, Thor. Thor's Oak was a sacred tree of the Germanic Chatti tribe.\n\nIn the Bible, the oak tree at Shechem is the site where Jacob buries the foreign gods of his people (Gen. 35:4) . In addition, Joshua erects a stone under an oak tree as the first covenant of the Lord (Josh. 24.25–7). In Isaiah 61, the prophet refers to the Israelites as \"Oaks of Righteousness.\" Absalom's long hair (2 Samuel 18:9) gets caught in an oak tree, and allows Joab to kill him.\n\nThe badnjak is central tradition in Serbian Orthodox Church Christmas celebration where young and straight oak, is ceremonially felled early on the morning of Christmas Eve.\n\nIn some traditions of Wicca, the Oak King is one of the two faces of the Sun God. He is born on Yule and rules from Ostara to Mabon.\n\nSeveral singular oak trees, such as the Royal Oak in Britain and the Charter Oak in the United States, are of great historical or cultural importance; for a list of important oaks, see .\n\n\"The Proscribed Royalist, 1651\", a famous painting by John Everett Millais, depicted a Royalist fleeing from Cromwell's forces and hidden in an oak. Millais painted the picture in Hayes, Kent, from a local oak tree that became known as the Millais Oak.\n\nApproximately 50 km west of Toronto, Canada is the town of Oakville, ON, famous for its history as a shipbuilding port on Lake Ontario.\n\nThe city of Raleigh, N.C., is known as \"The City of Oaks.\"\n\nThe Jurupa Oak tree – a clonal colony of \"Quercus palmeria\" or Palmer’s oak found in Riverside County, California – is an estimated 13,000 years old.\n\nLarge groups of very old oak trees are rare. One of the oldest groups of oak trees, found in Poland, is about 480 years old, which was assessed by dendrochronological methods.\n\nIn the Roman Republic, a crown of oak leaves was given to those who had saved the life of a citizen in battle; it was called the \"civic oak crown\".\n\n\nLinnaeus described only five species of oak from eastern North America, based on general leaf form. These were white oak, \"Quercus alba\"; chestnut oak, \"Q. montana\"; red oak, \"Q. rubra\"; willow oak \"Q. phellos\"; and water oak, \"Q. nigra\". Because he was dealing with confusing leaf forms, the \"Q. montana\" and \"Q. rubra\" specimens actually included mixed foliage of more than one species.\n\n\n"}

Then he became director of the Geological Survey of Berlin. In 1948 he became a professor at the University of Tübingen, where he retired as professor emeritus in 1964.\n\nHe was a saltationist who opposed the theory of gradual evolution, and in the 1930s suggested that major evolutionary transformations must have occurred in large leaps between species. This idea became known as the Hopeful Monster theory and was further taken and developed up by the geneticist Richard Goldschmidt in the 1940s. Schindewolf was also the first to suggest, in 1950, that mass extinctions might have been caused by extraterrestrial impacts or nearby supernova. From 1948 until his retirement in 1964, Schindewolf was professor of Geology and Paleontology at the University of Tübingen.\n\nAs a saltationist Schindewolf had supported macromutations as part of his evolutionary theory. He was known for presenting an alternative interpretation of the fossil record, combining orthogenesis, mutationism and extraterrestrial impacts, as opposed to Darwin's gradualism. Schindewolf's theory claimed that variation tended to move in a predetermined direction. His theory became known as typostrophism and stated that evolution occurs due to a periodic cyclic model of evolutionary processes which are predestined to go through a life cycle dictated by factors internal to the organism.\n\nPart of his \"typostrophism\" (German: \"Typostrophe\") theory advocated sudden evolutionary change by macromutations but he later dropped this view. His theory of orthogenesis (guided, straight-line evolution) and eventual decay went through three stages (typogenesis [explosion of new types], typostasis [maintenance of types], and typolysis [splitting of types, degeneration]) claimed to be embedded within a cyclical view of the evolutionary process. His theory also proposed that mass extinctions, especially the ones at the end of the Permian period 225 million years ago, were the result of cosmic radiation caused by supernova explosions. Schindewolf speculated that a supernova star explosion could emit radiation lethal to organisms if close enough to earth. He proposed that the radiation from a supernova could have two effects, extinguishing many species of life and causing macromutations which in turn could cause new species to originate. Schindewolf was the only scientist to have speculated that the first bird may have hatched from a reptile's egg. It was only a speculation and he abandoned the view of macromutations in later publications.\n\nHis book \"Basic Questions in Paleontology\" was published in German in 1950 and was translated into English in 1993 with a foreword written by Stephen Jay Gould.\n\n\nHis \"Basic Questions in Paleontology\" was published in German in 1950, and was a landmark work in the field of paleontology and evolution.\n\n"}

PDP is a project of Ocean Recovery Alliance.\n\n\nPDP asks businesses to measure, manage, reduce and benefit from plastic waste to create a world where plastic benefits consumers and businesses without negatively impacting the environment. PDP is based on the principle that to effectively manage and improve efficiency in plastic use, reuse and recycling, businesses must first quantify their plastics. Annual disclosure requests are sent to companies that use plastic for goods and/or services on behalf of socially conscious investors and community stakeholders.\n\nPDP aims to connect solution providers with prospective companies to facilitate design and innovation. All types of organisation are invited to participate in PDP and commit to reducing their plastic footprint.\n\nLush (company) became the first PDP Discloser in 2011.

{"id": "4147579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4147579", "title": "Reaction wood", "text": "Reaction wood\n\nReaction wood in a woody plant is wood that forms in place of normal wood as a response to gravity, where the cambial cells are oriented other than vertically. It is typically found on branches and leaning stems. It is an example of self optimisation and the axiom of uniform stress in trees.\n\nProgressive bending and cracking would occur in parts of the tree undergoing predominantly tensile or compressive stresses were it not for the localised production of reaction wood, which differs from ordinary wood in its mechanical properties. Reaction wood may be laid down in wider than normal annual increments, so that the cross section is often asymmetric or elliptical. The structure of cells and vessels is also different, resulting in additional strength. The effect of reaction wood is to help maintain the angle of the bent or leaning part by resisting further downward bending or failure.\n\nThere are two different types of reaction wood, which represent two different approaches to the same problem by woody plants:\n\nThe controlling factor behind reaction wood appears to be the hormone auxin, although the exact mechanism is not clear. In a leaning stem, the normal flow of auxin down the tree is displaced by gravity and it accumulates on the lower side. The formation of reaction wood may act in conjunction with other corrective or adaptive mechanisms in woody plants, such as thigomorphism (adaptive response to flexure) and gravitropism (the correction of, rather than the support of, lean) and the auxin-controlled balance of growth rates and growth direction between stems and branches. The term ‘adaptive growth' therefore includes, but is not synonymous with, the formation of reaction wood.\n\nAs a rule, reaction wood is undesirable in any structural application, primarily as its mechanical properties are different from normal wood: it alters the uniform structural properties of timber. Reaction wood can twist, cup or warp dramatically during machining. This movement can occur during the milling process, making it occasionally dangerous to perform certain operations without appropriate safety controls in place. For instance, ripping a piece of reaction wood on a table saw without a splitter or riving knife installed can lead to kick back of the stock. Reaction wood also responds to moisture differently from normal wood.\n\n"}
{"id": "141974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=141974", "title": "Southern Alps", "text": "Southern Alps\n\nThe Southern Alps / Kā Tiritiri o te Moana is a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the range's western side. The name \"Southern Alps\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.\n\nThe range includes the South Island's Main Divide, which separates the water catchments of the more heavily populated eastern side of the island from those on the west coast. Politically, the Main Divide forms the boundary between the Marlborough, Canterbury and Otago regions to the southeast and the Tasman and West Coast regions to the northwest.\n\nThe Southern Alps run approximately 500 km northeast to southwest. Its tallest peak is Aoraki / Mount Cook, the highest point in New Zealand at . The Southern Alps include sixteen other points that exceed in height (see NZ Mountains by Height). The mountain ranges are bisected by glacial valleys, many of which are infilled with glacial lakes on the eastern side including Lake Coleridge in the north to Lake Wakatipu in Otago in the south. According to an inventory conducted in the late 1970s, the Southern Alps contained over 3,000 glaciers larger than one hectare, the longest of which – the Tasman Glacier – is in length which has retreated from a recent maximum of in the 1960s.\n\nSettlements include Maruia Springs, a spa near Lewis Pass, the town of Arthur's Pass, and Mount Cook Village.\n\nMajor crossings of the Southern Alps in the New Zealand road network include Lewis Pass (SH7), Arthur's Pass (SH73), Haast Pass (SH6), and the road to Milford Sound (SH94).\n\nThe Southern Alps were named by Captain Cook on 23 March 1770, who described their \"prodigious height\". They had previously been noted by Abel Tasman in 1642, whose description of the South Island's west coast is often translated as \"a land uplifted high\". Following the passage of the Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the name of the range was officially altered to Southern Alps / Kā Tiritiri o te Moana.\n\nNew Zealand has a humid maritime, temperate climate with the Southern Alps lying perpendicular to the prevalialing westerly flow of air. Annual precipitation varies greatly across the range, from at the West Coast, close to the Main Divide, to east of the Main Divide. This high precipitation aids the growth of glaciers above the Snow line. Large glaciers and snowfields can be found west of or on the Main Divide, with smaller glaciers further east (See Glaciers of New Zealand).\n\nBecause of its orientation perpendicular to the prevailing westerly winds, the range creates excellent wave soaring conditions for glider pilots. The town of Omarama, in the lee of the mountains, has gained an international reputation for its gliding conditions. The prevailing westerlies also create a weather pattern known as the \"Nor'west arch\", in which moist air is pushed up over the mountains, forming an arch of cloud in an otherwise blue sky. This weather pattern is frequently visible in summer across Canterbury and North Otago. The 'Nor'wester' is a foehn wind similar to the Chinook of Canada, where mountain ranges in the path of prevailing moisture laden winds force air upwards, thus cooling the air and condensing the moisture to rain, producing hot dry winds in the descending air lee of the mountains.\n\nThe Southern Alps lie along a geological plate boundary, part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, with the Pacific Plate to the southeast pushing westward and colliding with the northward-moving Indo-Australian Plate to the northwest. Over the last 45 million years, the collision has pushed up a 20 km thickness of rocks on the Pacific Plate to form the Alps, although much of this has been eroded away. Uplift has been most rapid during the last 5 million years, and the mountains continue to be raised today by tectonic pressure, causing earthquakes on the Alpine Fault and other nearby faults. Despite the substantial uplift, most of the relative motion along the Alpine Fault is transverse, not vertical. However, significant dip-slip occurs on the plate boundary to the north and east of the North Island, in the Hikurangi Trench and Kermadec Trench. The transfer of motion from strike-slip on the Alpine Fault to dip-slip motion at these subduction zones to the north creates the Marlborough Fault System, which has resulted in significant uplift in the region.\n\nIn 2017 a large international team of scientists reported they had discovered beneath Whataroa, a small township on the Alpine Fault, \"extreme\" hydrothermal activity which \"could be commercially very significant\".\n\nThe mountains are rich in flora with about 25% of the country's plant species being found above the treeline in alpine plant habitats and grassland with mountain beech forest at lower elevations (of the eastern side but not in Westland). The cold windswept slopes above the treeline are covered with areas of fellfield. To the east, the Alps descend to the high grasslands of Canterbury and Otago. Plants adapted to the alpine conditions include woody shrubs like \"Hebe\", \"Dracophyllum\", and \"Coprosma\", the conifer snow totara \"(Podocarpus nivalis)\" and \"Carex\" sedge grasses.\n\nWildlife of the mountains includes the endemic rock wren \"(Xenicus gilviventris)\" and the kea, a large parrot that was once hunted as a pest. There are also a number of endemic insects adapted to these high altitudes especially flies, moths, beetles, and bees. The beech forests of the lower elevations are important habitat for two birds; the great spotted kiwi \"(Apteryx haastii)\" and the South Island kaka \"(Nestor meridionalis meridionalis)\".\n\nThe mountains are inaccessible and retain their natural vegetation. A large proportion of the range is well protected as part of various national parks, notably the Westland Tai Poutini National Park, Mount Aspiring National Park, and Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park or protected areas such as Lake Sumner Forest Park. Indigenous plant life is affected by introduced animals such as red deer (\"Cervus elaphus\"), chamois (\"Rupicapra rupicapra\"), and Himalayan tahr (\"Hemitragus jemlahicus\") all of which have at times been targeted for culling, while the birds and reptiles are vulnerable to introduced predators.\n"}

Three hundred thousand items are insects. Eleven thousand are herbarium leaves and other zoological and geological materials. The museum is visited mainly by Uzbeks and visitors from formerly-Soviet Union countries. \n\nThe four areas in the museum are geological-geographic department, flora and fauna department, scientific department and funds department.\n\nThe museum organizes many social events in Tashkent, including assemblies in many of the Republic's schools, academic lyceums, colleges and higher education facilities.\n\nThe Museum is the oldest in Uzbekistan. It was established in Tashkent by Russian scientists on July 12, 1876, as the Tashkent Museum. The museum closed and re-opened several times. In 1919, it opened as Turkestan National Museum. Two years later, in 1921, it became The State Museum of Nature of Uzbekistan. In 1930, the museum joined with the agricultural museum and became the \"Central Asian Museum of Nature and Building Power\". Five years later the museum took its current name. In 1937, the museum opened a classroom for students to receive lectures on Uzbekistan nature.\nThe museum has received many government awards for its contribution to the development of the academic sphere in Uzbekistan. In 1967, the museum was awarded \"Uzbekistan's Best Museum\". In 2006, the museum celebrated its 130-year anniversary.\n\n"}

They form a subgroup under the quark star category.\n\nStrange stars might exist without regard of the Bodmer–Witten assumption of stability at near-zero temperatures and pressures, as strange quark matter might form and remain stable at the core of neutron stars, in the same way as ordinary quark matter could. Such strange stars will naturally have a crust layer of neutron star material. The depth of the crust layer will depend on the physical conditions and circumstances of the entire star and on the properties of strange quark matter in general. Stars partially made up of quark matter (including strange quark matter) are also referred to as hybrid stars.\n\nThis theoretical strange star crust is proposed to be a possible reason behind the ever mysterious fast radio bursts (FRBs). While this is of course still theoretical; there is good evidence the researchers from this paper provide that point to the collapse of these strange star crusts to be a possible FRB point of origin.\n\nFor said crust to collapse from a strange star it must accrete matter from its environment in some form. This release of even small amounts of its matter cause a cascading effect on the stars crust. Which is thought to result in a massive release of magnetic energy as well as electron and positron pairs; in the initial first stages of the collapsing stage. This release of high energy particles and magnetic energy in such a short period of time causes the newly released electron/positron pairs to be directed towards the poles of the strange star due to the increased magnetic energy created by the initial secretion of the strange stars matter. Once these electron/positron pairs are directed to the poles they are then ejected at relativistic velocities, which is then believed to be one of the causes to what astronomers in the past 11 years of observing this phenomenon known as FRBs could be.\n\nTheoretical investigations have revealed that quark stars might not only be produced from neutron stars and powerful supernovae, they could also be created in the early cosmic phase separations following the Big Bang. If these primordial quark stars transform into strange quark matter before the external temperature and pressure conditions of the early universe makes them unstable, they might turn out stable, if the Bodmer–Witten assumption holds true. Such primordial strange stars could survive to this day.\n\nRecent theoretical research has found mechanisms by which quark stars with \"strange quark nuggets\" may decrease the objects' electric fields and densities from previous theoretical expectations, causing such stars to appear very much like—nearly indistinguishable from—ordinary neutron stars. This suggests that many, or even all, known neutron stars might in fact be strange stars. However, the investigating team of Prashanth Jaikumar, Sanjay Reddy, and Andrew W. Steiner made some fundamental assumptions that led to uncertainties in their results large enough that the case is not finally settled. More research, both observational and theoretical, remains to be done on strange stars in the future.\n\nOther theoretical work contends that: \"A sharp interface between quark matter and the vacuum would have very different properties from the surface of a neutron star\"; and, addressing key parameters like surface tension and electrical forces that were neglected in the original study, the results show that as long as the surface tension is below a low critical value, the large strangelets are indeed unstable to fragmentation and strange stars naturally come with complex strangelet crusts, analogous to those of neutron stars.\n\n"}

In most temperate coniferous forests, evergreen conifers predominate, while some are a mix of conifers and broadleaf evergreen trees and/or broadleaf deciduous trees. Temperate evergreen forests are common in the United States of America, areas of regions that have mild winters and heavy rainfall, or inland in drier climates or mountain areas. Temperate coniferous forests are found mainly in the Northern Hemisphere in North America, Europe, and Asia, but some are found in the Southern Hemisphere.. A separate ecoregion, the tropical coniferous forests, occurs in more tropical climates.\n\nStructurally, these forests are rather simple, generally consisting of two layers: an overstory and understory. Some forests may support an intermediate layer of shrubs. Pine forests support a herbaceous understory that is generally dominated by grasses and herbaceous perennials, and are often subject to ecologically important wildfires. Many species of tree inhabit these forests including cedar, cypress, Douglas fir, fir, juniper, pine, podocarpus, spruce, redwood and yew. The understory also contains a wide variety of herbaceous and shrub species.\n\nTemperate coniferous forests around the world sustain the highest levels of biomass in any terrestrial biome and are notable for trees of massive proportions, including coast redwood (\"Sequoia sempervirens\"), giant sequoia (\"Sequoiadendron giganteum\"), Douglas fir (\"Pseudotsuga menziesii\"), Sitka spruce (\"Picea sitchensis\"), Alerce (\"Fitzroya cupressoides\") and kauri (\"Agathis australis\"). These forests are quite rare, occurring in small areas of North America, southwestern South America, some mountainous regions of Eurasia, and northern New Zealand. The Klamath-Siskiyou forests of northwestern California and southwestern Oregon are known for their rich variety of plant and animal species, including many endemic species.\n\n<br>\n\nIn Russia, a coniferous forest, specifically pine or spruce forest is known as bor (). Bors typically grow on well-drained sandy soils, sandy clay soils and mild loams. The names of several Russian historical buildings and localities refer to the word \"bor\" as the original place where they were built, such as Borovitskaya Tower or Church of the Savior on Bor.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1448364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1448364", "title": "USS Relief (1836)", "text": "USS Relief (1836)\n\nThe first USS \"Relief\" was a supply ship in the United States Navy.\n\n\"Relief\" was laid down in 1835 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and launched on 14 September 1836. Designed by Samuel Humphreys, she was built along merchant vessel lines and included trysail mast and gaffsail on all three masts to enable her to work to windward in strong winds. Her hull was pierced for 16 small guns, but she usually carried only four to six 18-pounder and two 12-pounders.\n\nIn early December 1836, \"Relief\", commanded by Lieutenant Thomas A. Dornin, left Philadelphia for Norfolk, Virginia to join the ships assigned to the United States South Sea Surveying and Exploring Expedition. However, that expedition, held up by lack of money, ships, equipment, and trained personnel—and by administrative feuding since its first authorization in 1828—continued to be delayed until the summer of 1838. During her 19-month wait, \"Relief\" remained at Norfolk or engaged in runs along the east coast.\n\nOn 19 August 1838, the squadron, commanded by Lt. Charles Wilkes, cleared Hampton Roads and set a course for Rio de Janeiro. Sailing with the prevailing winds—westerlies and northeast trades—their planned course took them across the Atlantic to Madeira; then straight to Brazil. However, \"Relief\", under Lt. A. K. Long, proved to be a slow sailer. She soon fell behind and was detached with orders to rejoin the other five vessels in the Cape Verde Islands. The rendezvous was accomplished in early October and the squadron sailed for Brazil. \"Relief\", the last to arrive, reached Rio on 26 November.\n\nOn 6 January 1839, the squadron sailed for the Río Negro and Cape Horn. \"Relief\", bypassing the former where surveys were conducted, rounded the Cape and reached Orange Harbor, on the Hardy Peninsula, Hoste Island, on the 30th. There for almost three weeks, her crew kept hourly registers of the tides, placed navigation lights, and cut wood. On 18 February, the others arrived and toward the end of the month they were dispersed on various missions. Two followed James Weddell's course to Antarctica; others traced James Cook's path. \"Relief\" was ordered north to the Straits of Magellan, via the Cockburn Channel, to survey harbors in the straits. Caught in storms, however, she was unable to penetrate the channel and, in mid-March, was almost wrecked off Noir Island. The loss of her anchor during her battle with the sea off Noir, prohibited further attempts to enter the channel and she headed for Valparaíso.\n\nOn 15 April she entered the anchorage to make repairs and await the remainder of the squadron which by mid-May was reunited. In June, they moved on to Callao, where the ships were refitted and replenished. When \"Relief\" was unloaded and smoked, her dead rats filled three barrels.\n\nBecause of her slowness, \"Relief\" was ordered to proceed from Callao to Sydney, then sail home—carrying the sick and malcontents with her. Sailing in mid-July, she spent two weeks in the Sandwich Islands (Hawaiian Islands) and three months after leaving Peru, put into Sydney. She discharged her remaining cargo, took on water, wood, and rock ballast and headed east. En route home, she again doubled Cape Horn and on 28 March 1840 she reached New York.\n\nAt the end of the year, \"Relief\", repaired and overhauled, sailed again for the Pacific, where she remained for five years operating primarily off the west coast of South America. She returned to New York in April 1846. In May, war with Mexico broke out; and, in July, \"Relief\" joined the Home Squadron. From then until June 1848, she cruised in the Gulf of Mexico, attempting to maintain a steady supply line to the ships engaged in the blockade of the Mexican coast despite the distance to supply bases and the scarcity of ships of her type.\n\nIn July 1848, \"Relief\" returned to New York and in the fall sailed from Norfolk for the Brazil Station. The following spring, she was back at Norfolk, but, with the autumn, she headed east. She operated in the Mediterranean Sea until she returned to the United States in July 1850, and engaged in resupply runs to Brazil until placed out of commission for overhaul 20 November 1855. She recommissioned 19 February 1856 and resumed her runs to the Brazil Station and continued them through 1857.\n\nIn late 1858 she rejoined the Home Squadron and cruised in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1861, she crossed the Atlantic again, resupplied the African Squadron and, with the outbreak of the American Civil War, returned to the United States to resupply the ships of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In July 1862, she returned to the Gulf of Mexico and, until the fall of 1863, served primarily as station store ship at Ship Island in Mississippi Sound.\n\nThen ordered to Boston, Massachusetts for overhaul, she was decommissioned 5 December 1863. Recommissioned 29 April 1864, she was ordered back to the Pacific. In July she delivered supplies at Rio de Janeiro, whence she continued on to China, arriving at the Portuguese colony of Macau in December. After service on the Asiatic Station, she returned to New York in late 1866 and was placed in ordinary. In 1871 she was ordered to Washington, D.C., where she served as receiving ship until 1877. The following year she was laid up, at Washington, and on 27 September 1883 she was sold to J. B. Agnew.\n\n"}

There are two main types: lava plateaus and pyroclastic plateaus.\n\nLava plateaus are formed by highly fluid (runny) basaltic lava during numerous successive eruptions through numerous vents without violent explosions (quiet eruptions). These eruptions are quiet because of low viscosity of lava, so that it is very fluid and contains a small amount of trapped gases. The resulting sheet lava flows may be extruded from linear fissures or rifts or gigantic volcanic eruptions through multiple vents characteristic of the prehistoric era which produced giant flood basalts. Multiple successive and extensive lava flows cover the original landscape to eventually form a plateau, which may contain lava fields, cinder cones, shield volcanoes and other . In some cases, a lava plateau may be part of a single volcano. An example is the massive Level Mountain shield volcano in northern British Columbia, Canada, which covers an area of and a volume of .\n\nPerhaps the most extensive of all the subaerial basaltic plateaus existed during the Paleogene and possibly extended over of the northern Atlantic Ocean region. This region, known as the Thulean Plateau, is generally believed to have been broken up by foundering of the Earth's crust to form the present ocean basin.\n\nThe Earth features numerous subaerial and submarine volcanic plateaus such as the Columbia River Plateau (subaerial) and the vast Ontong Java Plateau (submarine).\n\nPyroclastic plateaus are produced by massive pyroclastic flows and they are underlain by pyroclastic rocks: agglomerates, tephra, volcanic ashes cemented into tuffs, mafic or felsic.\n\nExamples include Shirasu-Daichi which covers almost all of Southern Kyūshū, Japan and the North Island Volcanic Plateau in New Zealand.\n"}
