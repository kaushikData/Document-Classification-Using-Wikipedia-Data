He also postulated that the earth originated from the atmosphere of a comet and that all major changes in earth's history could be attributed to the action of comets. It was published in 1696 and was well received by intellectuals of the day such as Isaac Newton and John Locke.\n\nThe book is organized as follows:\n\n\nIn the introduction, Whiston discusses the Mosaic account of creation. He argues for a literal interpretation of Genesis, writing:\n\nIn so doing, he challenges allegorical and mythological interpretations of Genesis, concluding that:\n\nHe interprets the Genesis account of creation as being only of the preparation of the Earth for mankind, and not as an account of creation from nothing (\"ex nihilo\"). He draws this from the text, as the account speaks of the waters that existed before God's first creative act on the first day, implying that the Earth predates Genesis chapter one.\n\nHe interprets the account of \"placing the heavenly bodies in the firmament\" as simply being a consequence of the terrestrial frame of reference, for the heavenly bodies do in fact revolve about the Earth from the perspective of a man standing on the Earth. \n\nHe describes his Arianism, or the view that Jesus is subordinate to God but first in creation, a view considered heretical within much of Christianity. He also asserts that it is very reasonable to believe that man may well be simply one of many intelligent beings, and certainly not the highest before God. He wrote that humanity was fallen, and currently in a miserable state akin to probation.\n\nHe concludes the introduction with his three \"Postulata\":\n\nWhiston begins by arguing for the existence of a human soul. He argues that the Newtonian laws of motion provide that matter may never move spontaneously, but only when acted upon by an outside force. He notes that humans, animals, and plants are able to move spontaneously, and concludes that they must be more than \"mere matter,\" which, especially in the case of humans, he argues to be evidence of an incorporeal soul.\n\nIn the next sections of his book, Whiston goes on to describe his theory of the creation of the Earth, and the flood. He asserted that the Earth was originally a comet, which God formed from its initial \"chaos and void\" into a habitable planet. He also argued that the flood itself was caused when the Earth passed through the tail of a comet, which, it was known by that time, are composed largely of water. His analysis was very detailed, and similar ideas were promoted in the 1960s by other creationists postulating causes for the global flood, along with similarity to the ideas of Immanuel Velikovsky. However, many of them are in direct conflict with contemporary scientific understandings; and comets are not mentioned in flood accounts.\n\n\n"}

The film focuses on Jewish teachings about caring for the earth, treatment of animals, and the environment, with a focus on vegetarianism. Interviews with rabbis, activists, and scholars are interspersed with footage and stills illustrating the points being discussed.\n\nThe film opens with footage of a NASA rocket launch, an animation of our solar system, and a quote from Deuteronomy 30:19 about choosing between life and death (illustrated with images of the planet Earth as seen from space, contrasted with an exploding atom bomb). This is followed by a statement that humanity has not been caring for the Earth properly according to Jewish teachings. Next comes a section about ancient Jewish texts and \"sacred words\" that provide \"specific instructions on how to be custodians of the world in which we live.\" Throughout the film, quotes from the Torah, illustrated with closeups of Hebrew scrolls, Jews praying, and nature scenes, will be contrasted with the various environmental threats facing humanity today.\n\nThe scene shifts once again to the Earth from space, as the camera moves in to focus on Israel. The narrator then uses that country as a microcosm of current global problems related to air and water pollution, over-population, climate change, health concerns, etc. The film moves on to look at problems globally, with scenes shot all over the world. The focus then shifts to the United States where all the relevant issues are discussed in detail.\n\nReference is made to the United Nations FAO 2006 report, Livestock's Long Shadow, which makes the claim that livestock agriculture produces more greenhouse gasses than all the world's vehicles combined. Next comes a brief presentation, illustrated with simple animated charts, on how meat production is an inefficient way to produce food for a hungry world. This moves into footage of animal abuses on feedlots and factory farms and the pollution produced by these facilities. The film then focuses on the advantages of vegetarianism for reducing pollution and solving world hunger. With a change of diet toward vegetarianism, the film asserts, many of these environmental and health problems can be solved. After some fast-moving images of people and nature accompanied by music, the film ends with the same statement from Deuteronomy about \"life and death,\" voiced over a sunrise.\n\nNarrated by Lionel Friedberg. Biblical quotations are read by Theodore Bikel.\n\nThe following people appear in the film:\n\nChief Rabbis\n\n\nOther Rabbis\n\n\nIsraeli Environmentalists\n\n\nActivists\n\n\nThe idea for the film was inspired by the writings of Richard H. Schwartz \"(Judaism and Vegetarianism, Judaism and Global Survival, etc.)\" who also served as associate producer. Schwartz had seen the Christian Vegetarian Association's 2006 film, \"Honoring God's Creation\", and felt that a similar film would be effective in the Jewish community. At the time, he envisioned the film to be about 30 minutes long.\n\nProduction began in 2005 with a basic proposal and outline in the JVNA's newsletter, along with a statement that Lionel Friedberg was willing to do it for \"a very low fee, basically to cover his costs.\" The film was underwritten by JVNA, through private contributions. Preliminary drafts of the script were circulated among members of the JVNA advisory committee and others for input and went through numerous revisions. Meanwhile, Schwartz and Friedberg set about interviewing possible participants and filming nature footage in both Israel and the United States. Some stock footage was also acquired.\n\nThe showing of slaughterhouse footage was controversial. Some members of a test audience in Staten Island, New York, branded it as propaganda. \"Richard and I were accused of making a propaganda film for the vegetarian movement. We were accused of showing 'horrors that are impossible to watch,'\" Friedberg recalls. But he felt the graphic footage was necessary. In contrasting his film with the more sanitized versions produced by the kosher meat industry, Friedberg stated: \"To celebrate Judaism by depicting the assembly-line process by which animals are miraculously and happily turned into food for the Shabbat table without depicting the brutal cruelty and suffering that goes along with that process makes a mockery of the real meaning of our faith.\" The film opens with a warning that it contains material that might be disturbing to some viewers.\n\n\"A Sacred Duty\" was released direct-to-video on DVD, with public showings in both Israel and the United States, during October–November 2007. Over 35,000 copies were distributed free of charge to synagogues, educational institutions, and individuals, with permission to show the film without royalties. In addition, permission was granted to the public to duplicate and distribute it free of charge. The full version was also posted on YouTube. Numerous short excerpts have also been edited and re-posted by various YouTube users.\n\n\n"}

The little edifice, built in 1867, got the same dedication as the shrine erected in this place in the fifth century which, until its destruction in 1434, was one of the most important sanctuaries of Greek Orthodoxy.\n\nThe church is located in Istanbul, in the district of Fatih, in the neighbourhood of Ayvansaray, along \"Mustafa Paşa Bostanı Sokak\". It lies a few hundred meters inside the walled city, at a short distance from the shore of the Golden Horn. The building is protected by a high wall, and preceded by a garden.\n\nIn 450, Empress Aelia Pulcheria started to build a church near a fountain of holy water () situated outside the walls of Theodosius II at the foot of the sixth hill of Constantinople. After her death in 453, the shrine was completed by her husband, Emperor Marcian.\n\nEmperor Leo I erected near the church two other buildings: a parekklesion, named \"Ayía Sorós\" (\"holy reliquary\"), since it hosted the holy mantle and robe of the Virgin brought from Palestine in 473, and the \"´Ayion Loúsma\" (\"sacred bath\") edifice, which enclosed the fountain.\n\nThe importance assumed by the whole complex encouraged the Emperors to lodge in the surroundings and to build there the nucleus of what would in later centuries become the imperial palace of Blachernae. During the first quarter of the 6th century, Emperors Justin I and Justinian I restored and enlarged the church. The name of Blachernae may come from old name of Romanians (Vlach, Blac, etc.) and from a small colony of vlachs\n\nSaint Mary hosted a famous icon of the Virgin, named after the church \"Vlachernítissa\". It was painted on wood and revetted with gold and silver. This icon and the relics of the Virgin kept in the parekklesion were considered by the Byzantines as most powerful, useful during a war or in case of natural disasters. The first proof of the power of these objects came in 626. During that year Constantinople was besieged by the combined armies of the Avars and the Persians, while Emperor Heraclius was away, fighting the Persians in Mesopotamia. The son of the Emperor, Constantine, together with Patriarch Sergius and Patrician Bonus carried in procession along the ramparts the icon of the Blachernitissa. Some time later the fleet of the Avars was destroyed. The Khan of the Avars afterwards said that he had been frightened by the vision of a young woman adorned with jewels scouring the walls.\n\nAfter the end of the siege, the Byzantines learned with joy that the building of the church, which at that time lay outside the Walls, was the only one not to have been plundered by the invaders. When the victorious Heraclius came back to Constantinople, bringing back the True Cross which had been captured by the Persians in Jerusalem, the Patriarch received him at Saint Mary. Sometime later, the Emperor built a single wall to protect the church, thus enclosing in the City the suburb of Blachernae.\n\nThe protection of the Virgin of the Blachernae was also credited with the Byzantine victories during the Arab siege of 717-718, and in 860, during the invasion of the Rus'. In this occasion, the Veil of the Virgin (\"mafórion\"), which by that time had joined the other relics in the church, was shortly plunged in the sea to invoke the protection of God on the fleet. Some days later the Rus' fleet was destroyed. In 926 too, during the war against Simeon of Bulgaria, the potency of the relics of the Virgin helped convince the Bulgarian Tsar to negotiate with the Byzantines instead of assaulting the City.\n\nOn August 15, 944, the church received other two important objects: the letter written by King Abgar V of Edessa to Jesus and the Mandylion. Both relics were then moved to the Church of the Virgin of the Pharos.\n\nSt. Mary, being a centre of the veneration of the Images, played also an important role in the religious fights of the Byzantines. During the Iconoclastic period, the final session of the Council of Hieria, where the cult of the images was condemned, took place in the church. As a consequence of that decision, Emperor Constantine V ordered the mosaics of the interior destroyed, and substituted them with others representing natural scenes with trees, birds and animals. On that occasion the Icon of the Blachernitissa was also hidden under a layer of silvery mortar. In 843, with the end of Iconoclasm, the Feast of Orthodoxy was celebrated for the first time in the church of Blachernae with an \"Agrypnía\" (\"holy Vigil\"), which occurred on the first Sunday of Lent.\n\nThe Blachernitissa was discovered again during restoration works executed during the reign of Romanos III Argyros, and became again one of the most venerated icons of Constantinople. The Church of Saint Mary was completely destroyed during a fire in 1070, and was rebuilt by Romanos IV Diogenes and Michael VII Doukas respecting the old plan.\n\nAccording to Anna Komnene, the so-called \"habitual miracle\" () occurred in the church before the Icon of the Virgin Blachernitissa. On Friday after sunset, when the church was empty, the veil which covered the icon moved up slowly, revealing the face of the Virgin, while 24 hours later it fell again slowly. Anyway, the miracle did not occur regularly, and ceased completely after the Latin conquest of the City.\n\nAfter the Latin invasion of 1204, the church was occupied by the Latin clergy and placed directly under the Holy See. Already before the end of the Latin Empire, John III Doukas Vatatzes redeemed the church and many monasteries for the Orthodox clergy in exchange for money.\n\nOn February 29, 1434, some noble children who were hunting pigeons on the roof of the church accidentally started a fire, which destroyed the whole complex and the surrounding quarter. The area was largely neglected during the Ottoman period. In 1867, the Guild of the Orthodox furriers bought the parcel around the holy fountain, and built there a small church.\n\nThe religious complex of Blachernae comprised three edifices: The Church of Saint Mary, the Chapel of the reliquary (\"Ayía Sorós\"), and the Sacred Bath (\"´Ayion Loúsma\").\n\nThe church proper, defined by all the sources as \"large\" (\"mégas naós\"), was of basilica type, with the space divided into three aisles by two colonnades. This plan is similar to that of other churches of the early type in Constantinople like St. John of Stoudios. It had a rectangular plan with sides of 96 m and 36 m. Justinian apparently built a dome on the church, since Procopius, in his work \"De Edificiis\", mentions that both colonnades bent in the middle of the nave describing a semicircle. Emperor Justin II added the two side arms, giving to the plan the appearance of a cross. The reconstruction of 1070 possibly respected this plan. The Spanish ambassador Ruy Gonzáles de Clavijo, who visited Constantinople in 1402, writes that the building was divided into three aisles, with the central higher than the flanking ones. The columns were made of green Jasper, while the capitals and the bases of the columns were gilded and carved in white marble. The church by that time had no dome anymore, but a multicoloured compartmented ceiling, decorated with golden garlands.\n\nThe walls at that time were covered with coloured marble panels, while originally a silvery mortar was used. Near the middle of the nave, there was a silver ambon, while at the end lied a rich iconostasis surrounded by sculptures. On the upper part of the walls, there were mosaics representing the miracles of Christ and several episodes of his life up to his Ascension. To the church belonged also tribunes and an oratory. The shrine communicated through a porticus and a stairway with the imperial Palace of Blachernae, which – lying on the slope of the hill – overlooked it.\n\nOn the right of the church lied the \"parekklísion\" of the \"Ayía Sorós\", which contained the dress and robe of the Virgin. The veil and a part of her belt (now at Vatopedi monastery on Mount Athos), were later also kept there. The building was round and had a narthex and tribunes. An icon of the Virgin donated by Emperor Leo I and his wife Verina was also worshipped there. On its right was kept the casket – adorned with gold and silver – which contained the relics. They were rescued from the Latin occupation, and after the restoration of the Empire were kept in the church, but were all destroyed during the fire of 1434.\n\nThe \"bath\" where the Emperor immersed himself comprised three parts: the robing room where he undressed, the \"kólymbos\" (pool for immersion) and the hall of Saint Photinos. It lay to the right of the parekklesion, and communicated with it through a door. The pool consisted of a large room surmounted by a dome with the basin in the middle. It was adorned with icons, and the water poured in the basin from the hands of a marble statue of the Virgin. An Image of Saint Photinos decorated the centre of the dome. Each year, on August 15 (the feast of Dormition), after the adoration of the \"Mafórion\" (holy veil) of the Virgin, the Emperor plunged three times in the sacred pool.\n\nThe small church which today encloses the Hagiasma has a trapezoidal plan with sloping roof, and is adorned with icons and frescoes. It is oriented in northwest-southeast direction. The holy fountain, which is believed to have healing powers, is always a favourite destination for Orthodox and Muslim pilgrims, who pour in the pool coins and hair pins. The pilgrim can also ritually wash his eyes at a line of faucets. Above them a modern palindrome inscription says: \"\"Nípson anomímata mi mónan ópsin\"\" (Greek: \"Wash the sins not only the eyes\"). The water falls into an underground gallery, which according to a tradition links the Hagiasma with that in Balıklı. The church is run by an episkopos and two papades. Each Friday morning the Akathist Hymn, composed by Patriarch Sergius during the Siege of 626, is sung there. Since the nearby area is not urbanized, it would be possible to explore it in order to understand more about the ancient complex.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "60605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60605", "title": "Dust storm", "text": "Dust storm\n\nA dust storm is a meteorological phenomenon common in arid and semi-arid regions. Dust storms arise when a gust front or other strong wind blows loose sand and dirt from a dry surface. Fine particles are transported by saltation and suspension, a process that moves soil from one place and deposits it in another.\n\nDrylands around North Africa and the Arabian peninsula are the main terrestrial sources of airborne dust. It has been argued that poor management of the Earth's drylands, such as neglecting the fallow system, are increasing dust storms size and frequency from desert margins and changing both the local and global climate, and also impacting local economies.\n\nThe term \"sandstorm\" is used most often in the context of desert sandstorms, especially in the Sahara Desert, or places where sand is a more prevalent soil type than dirt or rock, when, in addition to fine particles obscuring visibility, a considerable amount of larger sand particles are blown closer to the surface. The term \"dust storm\" is more likely to be used when finer particles are blown long distances, especially when the dust storm affects urban areas.\n\nAs the force of wind passing over loosely held particles increases, particles of sand first start to vibrate, then to saltate (\"leaps\"). As they repeatedly strike the ground, they loosen and break off smaller particles of dust which then begin to travel in suspension. At wind speeds above that which causes the smallest to suspend, there will be a population of dust grains moving by a range of mechanisms: suspension, saltation and creep.\n\nA study from 2008 finds that the initial saltation of sand particles induces a static electric field by friction. Saltating sand acquires a negative charge relative to the ground which in turn loosens more sand particles which then begin saltating. This process has been found to double the number of particles predicted by previous theories.\n\nParticles become loosely held mainly due to a prolonged drought or arid conditions, and high wind speeds. Gust fronts may be produced by the outflow of rain-cooled air from an intense thunderstorm. Or, the wind gusts may be produced by a dry cold front, that is, a cold front that is moving into a dry air mass and is producing no precipitation—the type of dust storm which was common during the Dust Bowl years in the U.S. Following the passage of a dry cold front, convective instability resulting from cooler air riding over heated ground can maintain the dust storm initiated at the front.\n\nIn desert areas, dust and sand storms are most commonly caused by either thunderstorm outflows, or by strong pressure gradients which cause an increase in wind velocity over a wide area. The vertical extent of the dust or sand that is raised is largely determined by the stability of the atmosphere above the ground as well as by the weight of the particulates. In some cases, dust and sand may be confined to a relatively shallow layer by a low-lying temperature inversion. In other instances, dust (but not sand) may be lifted as high as 20,000 feet (6,100 m) high.\n\nDrought and wind contribute to the emergence of dust storms, as do poor farming and grazing practices by exposing the dust and sand to the wind.\n\nOne poor farming practice which contributes to dust storms is dryland farming. Particularly poor dryland farming techniques are intensive tillage or not having established crops or cover crops when storms strike at particularly vulnerable times prior to revegetation. In a semi-arid climate, these practices increase susceptibility to dust storms. However, soil conservation practices may be implemented to control wind erosion.\n\nA sandstorm can transport and carry large volumes of sand unexpectedly. Dust storms can carry large amounts of dust, with the leading edge being composed of a wall of thick dust as much as high. Dust and sand storms which come off the Sahara Desert are locally known as a simoom or simoon (sîmūm, sîmūn). The \"haboob\" (həbūb) is a sandstorm prevalent in the region of Sudan around Khartoum, with occurrences being most common in the summer.\n\nThe Sahara desert is a key source of dust storms, particularly the Bodélé Depression and an area covering the confluence of Mauritania, Mali, and Algeria.\n\nSaharan dust storms have increased approximately 10-fold during the half-century since the 1950s, causing topsoil loss in Niger, Chad, northern Nigeria, and Burkina Faso. In Mauritania there were just two dust storms a year in the early 1960s, but there are about 80 a year today, according to Andrew Goudie, a professor of geography at Oxford University. Levels of Saharan dust coming off the east coast of Africa in June 2007 were five times those observed in June 2006, and were the highest observed since at least 1999, which may have cooled Atlantic waters enough to slightly reduce hurricane activity in late 2007.\n\nDust storms have also been shown to increase the spread of disease across the globe. Virus spores in the ground are blown into the atmosphere by the storms with the minute particles and interact with urban air pollution.\n\nShort-term effects of exposure to desert dust include immediate increased symptoms and worsening of the lung function in individuals with asthma, increased mortality and morbidity from long-transported dust from both Saharan and Asian dust storms suggesting that long-transported dust storm particles adversely affects the circulatory system. Dust pneumonia is the result of large amounts of dust being inhaled.\n\nProlonged and unprotected exposure of the respiratory system in a dust storm can also cause silicosis, which, if left untreated, will lead to asphyxiation; silicosis is an incurable condition that may also lead to lung cancer. There is also the danger of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (\"dry eyes\") which, in severe cases without immediate and proper treatment, can lead to blindness.\n\nDust storms cause soil loss from the dry lands, and worse, they preferentially remove organic matter and the nutrient-rich lightest particles, thereby reducing agricultural productivity. Also the abrasive effect of the storm damages young crop plants. Dust storms also reduced visibility affecting aircraft and road transportation. In addition dust storms also create problems due to complications of breathing in dust.\n\nDust can also have beneficial effects where it deposits: Central and South American rain forests get most of their mineral nutrients from the Sahara; iron-poor ocean regions get iron; and dust in Hawaii increases plantain growth. In northern China as well as the mid-western U.S., ancient dust storm deposits known as loess are highly fertile soils, but they are also a significant source of contemporary dust storms when soil-securing vegetation is disturbed.\n\nDust storms are not limited to Earth and have been known to form on other planets such as Mars. These dust storms can extend over larger areas than those on Earth, sometimes encircling the planet, with wind speeds as high as . However, given Mars' much lower atmospheric pressure (roughly 1% that of Earth's), the intensity of Mars storms could never reach the kind of hurricane-force winds that are experienced on Earth. Martian dust storms are formed when solar heating warms the Martian atmosphere and causes the air to move, lifting dust off the ground. The chance for storms is increased when there are great temperature variations like those seen at the equator during the Martian summer.\n\n\n\n"}

Charles Darwin formulated the theory of fecundity selection between 1871 and 1874 to explain the widespread evolution of female-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD), where females were larger than males. \n\nAlong with the theories of natural selection and sexual selection, fecundity selection is a fundamental component of the modern theory of Darwinian selection. Fecundity selection is distinct in that large female size relates to the ability to accommodate more offspring, and a higher capacity for energy storage to be invested in reproduction. Darwin’s theory of fecundity selection predicts the following: \n\n\nAlthough sexual selection and fecundity selection are distinct, it still may be difficult to interpret whether sexual dimorphism in nature is due to fecundity selection, or to sexual selection. Examples of fecundity selection in nature include self-incompatibility flowering plants, where pollen of some potential mates are not effective in forming seed, as well as bird, lizard, fly, and butterfly and moth species that are spread across an ecological gradient. \n\nMoreau (1944) suggested that in more seasonal environments or higher latitudes, fecundity depends on high mortality. Lack (1954) suggested differential food availability and management across latitudes play a role in offspring and parental fitness. Lack also highlighted that more opportunities for parents to collect food due to an increase in day-length towards the poles is an advantage. This means that moderately higher altitudes provide more successful conditions to produce more offspring. However, extreme day-lengths (i.e. at the poles) may work against parental survival as repetitive food searching would exhaust the parent.\n\nTogether, the Moreau-Lack rule hypothesizes that fecundity increases with increasing latitude. Evidence supporting and doubting this claim has led to the consolidation of other predictions, which may better explain Moreau-Lack's rule.\n\nAshmole (1963) suggested (bird) fecundity depends on seasonality patterns. Food differences in availability between seasons are greater towards higher latitudes, so birds are predicted to experience low survival during the winter due to limited resources. This decline in population may be advantageous for survivors, since there is more food available by the next breeding season. This leads to an enhancement of energy when invested in fitness as a result of higher fecundity. Therefore, Ashmole's hypothesis is dependent upon resource availability as a factor fecundity.\n\nAreas with severe nest predation tend to be those of large clutches/litters, especially in the tropics, as they are more noticeable to predators (frequent parental care, noisier offspring). This predation pressure may lead to the selection for multiple nests of smaller size, with shorter development time. \n\nA criticism of this hypothesis is that it indirectly assumes that these nest-predators are visually-oriented, however, they may be chemically-oriented, too, with heightened olfactory senses. \n\nPopulations at higher latitudes experience a increasing seasonality and shorter warm seasons. As a result, these populations have more chances of having multiple reproductive episodes. Intense fecundity selection depends on the length of breeding season (LBS). Factors that may delay LBS or the start of breeding season, are snow cover or delayed food growth, which, in turn, minimizes the chance for these populations to reproduce. \n\nLong breeding seasons towards the tropics favor smaller clutches since females are able to balance energy reserved for reproduction, and the risk of predation. Fecundity selection acts by favoring early reproduction and higher clutch size in species that reproduce frequently. The opposite trend is seen in populations that reproduce less frequently, where delayed reproduction is favored. \n\nThe total fecundity per year depends on the length of breeding season (LBS), which also determines the number of breeding episodes. In addition, the total fecundity also depends on nest predation, as it describes differential survival over a variety of populations. When food is limited, and the breeding season is long, and nest predation is intense, selection tends to favor a 'bet-hedging' strategy, where the risk of predation is spread over many smaller clutches. This means that the success of the number of offspring depends on whether they are large in size or not. The strategy suggests that fewer, but larger, clutches in higher latitudes are a result of food seasonality, nest predation, and LBS.\n\nThe findings below are based on individual research studies.\n\nIt has been assumed that parents of fewer offspring, with a high probability of adult survival, should permit less risk to themselves. Even though this compromises their young, the overall fitness of their offspring is reduced, which is a strategy to invest in producing more offspring in the future. It was found that within and between regions, there is a negative correlation between clutch size and adult survival. Southern-Hemisphere parents were inclined to reduce mortality risk to themselves, even at a cost to their offspring, whereas Northern parents experienced greater risk to themselves to reduce risk to their offspring.\n\n\"Liolaemus\" species span from the Atacama Desert to austral rain forests and Patagonia, and across a wide range of altitudes. Due to radiation, life history strategies have diversified within this genus. In turn, it was found that increased fecundity does not lead to female-biased SSD, which is also not effected by latitude-elevation.\nIn lines of \"D. melanogaster\" selected for increased fecundity (i.e. more eggs laid over an 18-hour period), females experienced an increase in thorax and abdomen width than males. In general, SSD increased with selection for increased fecundity. These results support the hypothesis that in response to fecundity selection, SSD can evolve rapidly. \n\nFemale-biased SSD in many Lepidopteran species are initiated during their developmental period. Since females of this species, as in many other species, reserve their larval resources for reproduction, fecundity depends on larger (female) size. In this way, larger females can enhance fecundity as well as their survival by having multiple partners.\n\nNatural selection is defined as the differential survival and/or reproduction or organisms as a function of their physical attributes, where their 'fitness' is the ability to adapt to the environment and produce more (fertile) offspring. The trait(s) that contribute to survival or reproduction of offspring has a higher chance of being expressed in the population. \n\nSexual selection acts to refine secondary sexual (i.e. non-genital) phenotypes, such as the morphological differences between males and females (sexual dimorphism), or even differences between species of the same sex. As a refinement to Darwin's theory of selection, Trivers (1974) observed that:\n\n\n"}

A religious festival called the Fontinalia was held on October 13 in his honor. Throughout the city, fountains and wellheads were adorned with garlands.\n\nFons was the son of Juturna and Janus. Numa Pompilius, second king of Rome, was supposed to have been buried near the altar of Fons \"(ara Fontis)\" on the Janiculum. William Warde Fowler observed that between 259 and 241 BC, cults were founded for Juturna, Fons, and the Tempestates, all having to do with sources of water. As a god of pure water, Fons can be placed in opposition to Liber as a god of wine identified with Bacchus.\n\nAn inscription includes Fons among a series of deities who received expiatory sacrifices by the Arval Brothers in 224 AD, when several trees in the sacred grove of Dea Dia, their chief deity, had been struck by lightning and burnt. Fons received two wethers. Fons was not among the deities depicted on coinage of the Roman Republic.\n\nIn the cosmological schema of Martianus Capella, Fons is located in the second of 16 celestial regions, with Jupiter, Quirinus, Mars, the Military Lar, Juno, Lympha, and the Novensiles.\n\nWater as a source of regeneration played a role in the Mithraic mysteries, and inscriptions to \"Fons Perennis\" (\"Eternal Spring\" or \"Never-Failing Stream\") have been found in mithraea. In one of the scenes of the Mithraic cycle, the god strikes a rock, which then gushes water. A Mithraic text explains that the stream was a source of life-giving water and immortal refreshment. Dedications to \"inanimate entities\" from Mithraic narrative ritual, such as \"Fons Perennis\" and \"Petra Genetrix\" (\"Generative Rock\"), treat them as divine and capable of hearing, like the nymphs and healing powers to whom these are more often made.\n"}
{"id": "625297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=625297", "title": "Forbidden fruit", "text": "Forbidden fruit\n\nForbidden fruit is a phrase that originates from the Book of Genesis concerning Adam and Eve in . In the narrative, Adam and Eve eat the fruit of knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden, which they had been commanded not to do by God.\n\nThe narrative of the Book of Genesis places the first man and woman (Adam and Eve) in a garden where they may eat the fruit of many trees but are forbidden by God to eat from the \"tree of knowledge of good and evil\".\n\nIn Genesis 3, a serpent tempts the woman:\n\nDesiring this wisdom, the woman eats the forbidden fruit and gives some to the man who also eats it. They become aware of their \"nakedness\" and make fig-leaf clothes, and hide themselves when God approaches. God curses The Serpent, The Woman then The Man, and expels the Man and Woman from the garden and thereby from eternal life.\n\nThe word \"fruit\" appears in Hebrew as פֶּ֫רִי (\"pərî\" ). As to which fruit may have been the forbidden fruit of the Garden of Eden, possibilities include apple, grape, pomegranate, fig, carob, etrog or citron, pear, and mushrooms. The pseudepigraphic Book of Enoch describes the tree of knowledge: \"It was like a species of the Tamarind tree, bearing fruit which resembled grapes extremely fine; and its fragrance extended to a considerable distance. I exclaimed, How beautiful is this tree, and how delightful is its appearance!\" (1 Enoch 31:4).\n\nAn alternative view is that the forbidden fruit is metaphorical, possibly the fruit of the womb, i.e. sex and procreation from the tree of life. In his \"Autobiography of a Yogi\", Hindu spiritual teacher Paramhansa Yogananda cites an interpretation by his master Swami Sri Yuktiswar that the Garden of Eden refers to man's body, with the fruit in the center being that of the sexual organs.\n\nIn Western Europe, the fruit was often depicted as an apple. This was possibly because of a misunderstanding of – or a pun on – \"mălum\", a native Latin noun which means evil (from the adjective \"malus\"), and \"mālum\", another Latin noun, borrowed from Greek μῆλον, which means apple. In the Vulgate, Genesis 2:17 describes the tree as \"de ligno autem scientiae boni et mali\" : \"but of the tree [literally \"wood\" ] of knowledge of good and evil\" (\"mali\" here is the genitive of \"malum\").\n\nThe larynx, specifically the laryngeal prominence that joins the thyroid cartilage, in the human throat is noticeably more prominent in males and was consequently called an Adam's apple, from a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit getting stuck in Adam's throat as he swallowed it.\n\nRabbi Meir says that the fruit was a grape, made into wine. The Zohar explains similarly that Noah attempted (but failed) to rectify the sin of Adam by using grape wine for holy purposes. The midrash of Bereishit Rabah states that the fruit was grape, or squeezed grapes (perhaps alluding to wine).\n\nThe Bible states in the book of Genesis that Adam and Eve had made their own fig leaf clothing: \"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves girdles\". Based on that reference, the forbidden fruit may have been the fig.\n\nRabbi Nechemia, based on the Talmud, supports the idea that the fruit was a fig, as it was from fig leaves that God made garments for Adam and Eve upon expelling them from the Garden. \"By that with which they were made low were they rectified.\"\n\nSince the fig is a long-standing symbol of female sexuality, it enjoyed a run as a favorite understudy to the apple as the forbidden fruit during the Italian Renaissance. The most famous depiction of the fig as the forbidden fruit was painted by Michelangelo Buonarroti in his masterpiece fresco on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.\n\nProponents of the theory that the Garden of Eden was located somewhere in what is now known as the Middle East suggest that the fruit was actually a pomegranate, a plant indigenous from Iran to the Himalayas and cultivated since ancient times. The association of the pomegranate with knowledge of the underworld as provided in the Ancient Greek legend of Persephone may also have given rise to an association with knowledge of the otherworld, tying-in with knowledge that is forbidden to mortals.\n\nRabbi Yehuda proposes that the fruit was wheat, because \"a baby does not know to call its mother and father until it tastes the taste of grain.\"\n\nIn Hebrew, wheat is \"khitah\", which has been considered to be a pun on \"khet\", meaning \"sin\".\n\nAlthough commonly confused with a seed, in the study of botany a wheat berry is technically a simple fruit known as a caryopsis, which has the same structure as an apple. Just as an apple is a fleshy fruit that contains seeds, a grain is a dry fruit that absorbs water and contains a seed. The confusion comes from the fact that the fruit of a grass happens to have a form similar to some seeds.\n\nA fresco in the 13th-century Plaincourault Abbey in France depicts Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, flanking a Tree of Knowledge that has the appearance of a gigantic \"Amanita muscaria\", a psychoactive mushroom.\nTerence McKenna proposed that the forbidden fruit was a reference to psychotropic plants and fungi, specifically psilocybin mushrooms, which played a central role, he theorized, in the evolution of the human brain. Earlier, in a well-documented and heavily criticized study, John M. Allegro proposed the mushroom as the forbidden fruit.\n\nThe similarities of the story to the story of Pandora's box were identified by early Christians such as Tertullian, Origen, and Gregory of Nazianzus.\n\nAccording to the , Surah Al-A'raf 7:19 describes and his wife in Paradise where they may eat what is provided, except that they may not eat from one particular tree, should they be considered \"Zalimun\" (wrongdoers). Surah Ibrahim 14:26 describes the forbidden tree as an evil tree that is forbidden for guidance.\n\nSurah Al-A'raf 7:22 describes the (Satan) who misled them with deception, and then it was who initiated eating from the forbidden tree. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame became manifest to them and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise. And their Lord called out to them: \"Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you; Verily, Shaitân is an open enemy unto you?\" (). The holds both Adam and his wife accountable for eating the forbidden fruit. As punishment, they were forced to leave the garden, banished from Heaven and sent to the Earth where they were forgiven after repenting.\n\n\n"}

It is named after the main production site of Fushun, Liaoning province in northeastern China.\n\nThe Fushun process was developed and utilized for the extraction of shale oil in China during the mid-1920s. The commercial-scale utilization of the process began in 1930 with the construction of \"Refinery No. 1\". After World War II, the shale oil production was ceased, but 100 Fushun-type oil shale retorts were restored in 1949. In 1950, total 266 retorts were in operation, each with the capacity of 100–200 tons of shale oil per day.\n\nWith the discovery of Daqing oil field in the 1960s, the shale oil production declined and Sinopec, an operator of shale oil production these times, shut down its oil shale operations in the beginning of the 1990s. At the same time, the Fushun Oil Shale Retorting Plant, using Fushun process technology, was established as a part of the Fushun Mining Group. It started production in 1992. In 2005, China became the largest shale oil producer in the world.\n\nIn 1985-1986, Sinopec used the Fushun process for a test processing of Jordan's oil shale from the El Lajjun deposit. Although the process was technically viable, the cooperation was halted due to high operation costs.\n\nThe Fushun process is classified as an internal combustion technology but also includes external gas heating. It uses a vertical cylindrical type shaft retort, with outside steel plate lined with inner fire bricks. The retort has height over and its inner diameter is about . Raw oil shale particles with the size of are fed from the top of the retort. At the upper section of the retort oil shale is dried and heated by the ascending hot gases, which pass upward through the descending oil shale causing decomposition of the rock. The pyrolysis takes place at about . The produced oil vapor and gases exit from the top of the retort; hot gases and oil vapors move from the bottom to the top directly, and not diagonally like in Kiviter process. During the pyrolysis process, oil shale is decomposed to shale coke (char), which together with the ascending air-steam is burnt in the lower part of the retort to heat gases necessary for pyrolysis. These gases are recirculated; after leaving retort, they are cooled in a condensation system, where shale oil is condensed, and re-heated in a heating furnace about to before reinserting into the retort. The shale ash exits from a rotating water dish that acts as a seal and cooler at the bottom of the retort.\n\nRetorts are operated in sets and have a heat carrier preparation unit and rotating water seals designed for the whole set instead of a single retort as in case of the Kiviter retort. Regenerative furnaces are located next to the retorts and they are operating in two cycles – the combustion cycle and the gas heating cycle. During the combustion cycle, a furnace is heated up to by combustion gases. After the combustion cycle, retort gases from the condensation system is inserted into a furnace for their heating. By alternating furnaces, one furnace is always available for heating retort gas. Twenty retorts typically share one condensation system and a set of heating furnaces.\n\nAdvantages of the Fushun process include small investment and stable operation. The process is characterized by the high thermal efficiency, but due to the addition of air into the retort, the nitrogen dilutes the pyrolysis gas. In addition, the excess oxygen in retort burns out a part of produced shale oil, which reduce the shale oil yield. The oil yield of the Fushun retort accounts for about 65% of Fischer Assay. Disadvantage of this process is a high water consumption amounting to 6–7 barrels of water per barrel of produced shale-oil, and great quantities of waste shale. It is not suitable of ores with small size and oil content lower than 5%.\n\nAs the capacity of single retort is limited, Fushun process is suitable for small-scale retorting plants, and for processing lean oil shale with low gas yield.\n\nFushun process is used only in China. The Fushun Mining Group operates the largest by capacity shale oil plant in the world (Fushun Shale Oil Plant) consisting of 180 Fushun retorts. Each retort processes about 4 tonnes of oil shale per hour.\n\n"}
{"id": "41210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41210", "title": "Geostationary orbit", "text": "Geostationary orbit\n\nA geostationary orbit, often referred to as a geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO), is a circular geosynchronous orbit above Earth's equator and following the direction of Earth's rotation. An object in such an orbit appears motionless, at a fixed position in the sky, to ground observers. Communications satellites and weather satellites are often placed in geostationary orbits, so that the satellite antennae (located on Earth) that communicate with them do not have to rotate to track them, but can be pointed permanently at the position in the sky where the satellites are located. Using this characteristic, ocean-color monitoring satellites with visible and near-infrared light sensors (e.g. GOCI) can also be operated in geostationary orbit in order to monitor sensitive changes of ocean environments.\n\nA geostationary orbit is a particular type of geosynchronous orbit, which has an orbital period equal to Earth's rotational period, or one sidereal day (23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds). Thus, the distinction is that, while an object in geosynchronous orbit returns to the same point in the sky at the same time each day, an object in geostationary orbit never leaves that position. Geosynchronous orbits move around relative to a point on Earth's surface because, while geostationary orbits have an inclination of 0° with respect to the Equator, geosynchronous orbits have varying inclinations and eccentricities.\n\nThe first appearance of a geostationary orbit in popular literature was in the first Venus Equilateral story by George O. Smith, but Smith did not go into details. British science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke disseminated the idea widely, with more details on how it would work, in a 1945 paper entitled \"Extra-Terrestrial Relays — Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?\", published in \"Wireless World\" magazine. Clarke acknowledged the connection in his introduction to \"The Complete Venus Equilateral\". The orbit, which Clarke first described as useful for broadcast and relay communications satellites, is sometimes called the Clarke Orbit. Similarly, the Clarke Belt is the part of space about above sea level, in the plane of the equator, where near-geostationary orbits may be implemented. The Clarke Orbit is about in circumference.\n\nMost commercial communications satellites, broadcast satellites and SBAS satellites operate in geostationary orbits. A geostationary transfer orbit is used to move a satellite from low Earth orbit (LEO) into a geostationary orbit. The first satellite placed into a geostationary orbit was the Syncom-3, launched by a Delta D rocket in 1964.\n\nA worldwide network of operational geostationary meteorological satellites is used to provide visible and infrared images of Earth's surface and atmosphere. These satellite systems include:\n\nA statite, a hypothetical satellite that uses a solar sail to modify its orbit, could theoretically hold itself in a geostationary \"orbit\" with different altitude and/or inclination from the \"traditional\" equatorial geostationary orbit.\n\nSatellites in geostationary orbits are far enough away from Earth that communication latency becomes significant — about a quarter of a second for a trip from one ground-based transmitter to the satellite and back to another ground-based transmitter; close to half a second for a round-trip communication from one Earth station to another and then back to the first.\n\nFor example, for ground stations at latitudes of \"φ\" = ±45° on the same meridian as the satellite, the time taken for a signal to pass from Earth to the satellite and back again can be computed using the cosine rule, given the geostationary orbital radius \"r\" (derived below), the Earth's radius \"R\" and the speed of light \"c\", as\n\nThis delay presents problems for latency-sensitive applications such as voice communication.\n\nGeostationary satellites are directly overhead at the equator and appear lower in the sky to an observer nearer the poles. As the observer's latitude increases, communication becomes more difficult due to factors such as atmospheric refraction, Earth's thermal emission, line-of-sight obstructions, and signal reflections from the ground or nearby structures. At latitudes above about 81°, geostationary satellites are below the horizon and cannot be seen at all. Because of this, some Russian communication satellites have used elliptical Molniya and Tundra orbits, which have excellent visibility at high latitudes.\n\nSatellites in geostationary orbit must all occupy a single ring above the equator. The requirement to space these satellites apart to avoid harmful radio-frequency interference during operations means that there are a limited number of orbital \"slots\" available, and thus only a limited number of satellites can be operated in geostationary orbit. This has led to conflict between different countries wishing access to the same orbital slots (countries near the same longitude but differing latitudes) and radio frequencies. These disputes are addressed through the International Telecommunication Union's allocation mechanism. In the 1976 Bogotá Declaration, eight countries located on the Earth's equator claimed sovereignty over the geostationary orbits above their territory, but the claims gained no international recognition.\n\nA geostationary orbit can be achieved only at an altitude very close to and directly above the equator. This equates to an orbital velocity of and an orbital period of 1,436 minutes, which equates to almost exactly one sidereal day (23.934461223 hours). This ensures that the satellite will match the Earth's rotational period and has a stationary footprint on the ground. All geostationary satellites have to be located on this ring.\n\nA combination of lunar gravity, solar gravity, and the flattening of the Earth at its poles causes a precession motion of the orbital plane of any geostationary object, with an orbital period of about 53 years and an initial inclination gradient of about 0.85° per year, achieving a maximal inclination of 15° after 26.5 years. To correct for this orbital perturbation, regular orbital stationkeeping manoeuvres are necessary, amounting to a delta-v of approximately 50 m/s per year.\n\nA second effect to be taken into account is the longitudinal drift, caused by the asymmetry of the Earth – the equator is slightly elliptical. There are two stable (at 75.3°E and 252°E) and two unstable (at 165.3°E and 14.7°W) equilibrium points. Any geostationary object placed between the equilibrium points would (without any action) be slowly accelerated towards the stable equilibrium position, causing a periodic longitude variation. The correction of this effect requires station-keeping maneuvers with a maximal delta-v of about 2 m/s per year, depending on the desired longitude.\n\nSolar wind and radiation pressure also exert small forces on satellites; over time, these cause them to slowly drift away from their prescribed orbits.\n\nIn the absence of servicing missions from the Earth or a renewable propulsion method, the consumption of thruster propellant for station keeping places a limitation on the lifetime of the satellite. Hall-effect thrusters, which are currently in use, have the potential to prolong the service life of a satellite by providing high-efficiency electric propulsion.\n\nWhen they run out of thruster fuel, the satellites are at the end of their service life, as they are no longer able to stay in their allocated orbital position. The transponders and other onboard systems generally outlive the thruster fuel and, by stopping N–S station keeping, some satellites can continue to be used in inclined orbits (where the orbital track appears to follow a figure-eight loop centred on the equator), or else be elevated to a \"graveyard\" disposal orbit.\n\nIn any circular orbit, the centripetal force required to maintain the orbit (F) is provided by the gravitational force on the satellite (F). To calculate the geostationary orbit altitude, one begins with this equivalence:\n\nBy Newton's second law of motion, we can replace the forces F with the mass \"m\" of the object multiplied by the acceleration felt by the object due to that force:\n\nWe note that the mass of the satellite \"m\" appears on both sides — geostationary orbit is independent of the mass of the satellite. Calculating the geostationary altitude, therefore, simplifies down to calculating the altitude where the magnitudes of the centripetal acceleration required for orbital motion and the gravitational acceleration provided by Earth's gravity are equal.\n\nThe centripetal acceleration's magnitude is:\n\nwhere \"ω\" is the angular speed, and \"r\" is the orbital radius as measured from the Earth's center of mass.\n\nThe magnitude of the gravitational acceleration is:\n\nwhere \"M\" is the mass of Earth, , and \"G\" is the gravitational constant,\n\nEquating the two accelerations gives:\n\nThe product \"GM\" is known with much greater precision than either factor alone; it is known as the geocentric gravitational constant \"μ\" = . Hence\n\nThe angular speed \"ω\" is found by dividing the angle travelled in one revolution (360° = 2π rad) by the orbital period (the time it takes to make one full revolution). In the case of a geostationary orbit, the orbital period is one sidereal day, or ). This gives\n\nThe resulting orbital radius is . Subtracting the Earth's equatorial radius, , gives the altitude of .\n\nOrbital speed is calculated by multiplying the angular speed by the orbital radius:\n\nBy the same formula, we can find the geostationary-type orbit of an object in relation to Mars (this type of orbit above is referred to as an areostationary orbit if it is above Mars). The geocentric gravitational constant \"GM\" (which is \"μ\") for Mars has the value of 42,828 kms, and the known rotational period (\"T\") of Mars is 88,642.66 seconds. Since \"ω\" = 2/\"T\", using the formula above, the value of \"ω\" is found to be approx 7.088218×10 s. Thus \"r\" = 8.5243×10 km, whose cube root is 20,427 km (the orbital radius); subtracting the equatorial radius of Mars (3396.2 km) gives the orbital altitude of 17,031 km.\n\nOrbital speed of a Mars geostationary orbit can be calculated as for Earth above:\n\nformula_10\n\n\n"}

The US was the world's largest helium producer, providing 40 percent of world supply. In addition, the US federal government sold 30 million cubic meters from storage. Other major helium producers were Algeria and Qatar. \n\nAll commercial helium is recovered from natural gas. Helium usually makes up a minuscule portion of natural gas, but can make up as much as 10 percent of natural gas in some fields. A helium content of 0.3 percent or more is considered necessary for commercial helium extraction. In 2012, helium was recovered at 16 extraction plants, from gas wells in Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming. One extraction plant in Utah was idle in 2012.\n\nIn 1903, an oil exploration well at Dexter, Kansas, produced a gas that would not burn. Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth took samples of the gas back to the University of Kansas at Lawrence where chemists Hamilton Cady and David McFarland discovered that gas contained 1.84 percent helium. This led to further discoveries of helium-bearing natural gas in Kansas.\n\nThe military was interested in helium for balloons and dirigibles. The US Army built the first helium extraction plant in 1915 at Petrolia, Texas, where a large natural gas field averaged nearly 1 percent helium. The United States Navy established three experimental helium plants during World War I, to recover enough helium to supply barrage balloons with the non-flammable, lighter-than-air gas. Two of the experimental plants were north of Fort Worth, Texas, and recovered helium from natural gas piped in from the Petrolia oil field in Clay County, Texas.\n\nThe Mineral Leasing Act, which provided for oil and gas leasing on federal land, reserved all helium contained in natural gas on federal land to the government.\n\nDuring World War II, military demand for helium rose, so the federal government built a number of new helium extraction plants. One such plant was at Shiprock, New Mexico, to recover helium from gas at the Rattlesnake Field. Gas from the Rattlesnake field, like that of a number of other fields in the Four Corners area, contained mostly nitrogen and very little hydrocarbons, and was produced exclusively for the helium.\n\nThe Helium Acts Amendments of 1960 (Public Law 86–777) empowered the U.S. Bureau of Mines to arrange for five private plants to recover helium from natural gas. The Bureau also built a pipeline from Bushton, Kansas, to connect those plants with the government's partially depleted Cliffside gas field, near Amarillo, Texas. The crude helium (50 percent to 80 percent helium) was injected and stored in the Cliffside gas field until needed, when it then was further purified.\n\nBy 1995, a billion cubic meters of the gas had been stored, but the reserve was US$1.4 billion in debt, prompting the Congress of the United States in 1996 to phase out the reserve. The resulting \"Helium Privatization Act of 1996\" (Public Law 104–273) directed the United States Department of the Interior to empty the reserve. Sales to government and government contractor began in 1998. Sales to the open market began in 2003. The sales program paid the indebtedness, and is still selling helium.\n\nAll commercial production of helium comes from natural gas. There are two basic types of commercial helium deposits: natural gas produced primarily for the hydrocarbon content, typically containing less than 3 percent helium; and gas with little or no hydrocarbons, produced solely for the helium, which typically makes up between 5 and 10 percent of the gas. Although natural gas in which helium is only a byproduct contains a much lower percentage of helium, historically it has supplied the most helium.\n\nMost geologists believe that the majority of helium in natural gas derives from radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, either from radioactive black shales, or granitoid basement rock. Granite and related rocks tend to contain more uranium and thorium than other rock types. However, some believe that the helium is largely primordial.\n\nUnusual geological conditions are considered necessary for commercial concentrations of helium in natural gas. Helium accumulations are commonly in structural closures overlying bedrock highs. Faults, fractures, and igneous intrusives are regarded by some geologists as important pathways for helium to migrate upward into the sedimentary section. The atomic radius of helium is so small that shale, which is effective in trapping methane, allows the helium to migrate upward through the shale pores. Nonporous caprock such as halite (rock salt) or anhydrite is more effective in trapping helium. Helium deposits occur mostly in Paleozoic rocks. \n\nHigh helium content of natural gas is accompanied by high contents of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The percentage of nitrogen is usually 10 to 20 times that of helium, so that natural gas with 5 percent or more helium may have little or no methane. A representative sample from the Pinta Dome in Apache County, Arizona, for instance, has 8.3 percent helium, 89.9 percent nitrogen, 1 percent carbon dioxide, and only 0.1 percent methane. In such cases, the gas is produced solely for its helium content.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the highest production and largest known reserves of helium were in the gases produced for their hydrocarbon content. The most important of these were the Hugoton, Panhandle, Greenwood, and Keyes fields, all located in western Kansas, and the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas. The Hugoton and Panhandle fields are particularly large, covering thousands of square miles. The helium content of the gas varies greatly within some fields. In the Panhandle field, helium content is highest, up to 1.3 percent or more, along the updip southwest edge, and lowest, 0.1 percent along the northeast edge. \n\nBy 2003, the natural gas fields of the Great Plains of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, still held important reserves, but out of 100 BCF of total measured helium reserves in the US, 61 BCF was contained in the Riley Ridge field of western Wyoming, a gas deposit produced for its carbon dioxide content. \n\nThe Four Corners area of the southwest US has a number of gas fields containing 5 to 10 percent helium and large percentages of nitrogen, with little or no hydrocarbons. The fields are associated with igneous intrusions. One field, Dineh-bi-Keyah in Arizona, produced oil from a fractured sill. The other fields have no associated oil. \n\nHelium-rich gas fields in the United States\n\nHelium is marketed in two specifications: crude helium, which typically contains 75 percent to 80 percent helium, and Grade A helium, which is 99.995 percent pure.\n\nA large volume of helium was stored underground in the Cliffside field in the decade following the Helium Act Amendments of 1960. In recent years, the reserve has been systematically selling its helium. As of 2012 the United States National Helium Reserve still accounted for 30 percent of the world's helium. The reserve was expected to run out of helium in 2018.\n\nThe United States is a major exporter of Helium.\n\nFor many years the United States produced more than 90% of the commercial helium in the world. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in Arzew, Algeria, began producing 17 million cubic meters (600 million cubic feet), enough to supply all of Europe's demand. In 2004–2006, two additional plants, one in Ras Laffan, Qatar, and the other in Skikda, Algeria, were built, and Algeria became the second leading producer of helium. \n\nIn August 2014, the Bureau of Land Management auctioned crude helium from the national reserve at an average price of $104 per MCF of helium content. Grade A helium sold for about US$200 per MCF, or $7.21 per cubic meter in 2014.\n"}
{"id": "360939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=360939", "title": "Hickory", "text": "Hickory\n\nHickory is a type of tree, comprising the genus Carya (, \"káryon\", meaning \"nut\"). The genus includes 17 to 19 species. Five or six species are native to China, Indochina, and India (Assam), as many as 12 are native to the United States, four are found in Mexico, and two to four are from Canada. A number of hickory species are used by man for products like edible nuts (pecans) or wood. \n\nHickories are deciduous trees with pinnately compound leaves and large nuts. Hickory flowers are small, yellow-green catkins produced in spring. They are wind-pollinated and self-incompatible. The fruit is a globose or oval nut, long and diameter, enclosed in a four-valved husk, which splits open at maturity. The nut shell is thick and bony in most species, and thin in a few, notably the pecan (\"C. illinoinensis\"); it is divided into two halves, which split apart when the seed germinates.\n\nBeaked hickory (\"Annamocarya sinensis\") is a species formerly classified as \"Carya sinensis\", but now adjudged in the monotypic genus \"Annamocarya\".\n\nIn the APG system, genus \"Carya\" (and the whole family Juglandaceae) has been recently moved to the order Fagales.\n\n\nHickory is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species. These include:\n\nThe hickory leaf stem gall phylloxera (\"Phylloxera caryaecaulis\") also uses the hickory tree as a food source. Phylloxeridae are related to aphids and have a similarly complex life cycle. Eggs hatch in early spring and the galls quickly form around the developing insects. \"Phylloxera\" galls may damage weakened or stressed hickories, but are generally harmless. \nDeformed leaves and twigs can rain down from the tree in the spring as squirrels break off infected tissue and eat the galls, possibly for the protein content or because the galls are fleshy and tasty to the squirrels. The pecan gall curculio (\"Conotrachelus elegans\") is a true weevil species also found feeding on galls of the hickory leaf stem gall phylloxera.\n\nThe banded hickory borer (\"Knulliana cincta\") is also found on hickories.\n\nSome fruits are borderline and difficult to categorize. Hickory nuts (\"Carya\") and walnuts (\"Juglans\") in the Juglandaceae family grow within an outer husk; these fruits are sometimes considered to be drupes or drupaceous nuts, rather than true botanical nuts. \"Tryma\" is a specialized term for such nut-like drupes.\n\nHickory wood is very hard, stiff, dense and shock resistant. There are woods that are stronger than hickory and woods that are harder, but the combination of strength, toughness, hardness, and stiffness found in hickory wood is not found in any other commercial wood. It is used for tool handles, bows, wheel spokes, carts, drumsticks, lacrosse stick handles, golf club shafts (sometimes still called \"hickory stick\", even though made of steel or graphite), the bottom of skis, walking sticks, and for punitive use as a switch (like hazel), and especially as a cane-like hickory stick in schools and use by parents. Paddles are often made from hickory. This property of hickory wood has left a trace in some Native American languages: in Ojibwe, hickory is called \"mitigwaabaak\", a compound of \"mitigwaab\" \"bow\" and the final \"-aakw\" \"hardwood tree\".\n\nBaseball bats were formerly made of hickory, but are now more commonly made of ash. Hickory is replacing ash as the wood of choice for Scottish shinty sticks (also known as camans). Hickory was extensively used for the construction of early aircraft.\n\nHickory is also highly prized for wood-burning stoves and chimineas because of its high energy content. Hickory wood is also a preferred type for smoking cured meats. In the Southern United States, hickory is popular for cooking barbecue, as hickory grows abundantly in the region and adds flavor to the meat.\n\nHickory is sometimes used for wood flooring due to its durability in resisting wear and character. Hickory wood is not noted for rot resistance.\n\nA bark extract from shagbark hickory is also used in an edible syrup similar to maple syrup, with a slightly bitter, smoky taste.\n\nThe nuts of some species are palatable, while others are bitter and only suitable for animal feed. Shagbark and shellbark hickory, along with pecan, are regarded by some as the finest nut trees.\n\nWhen cultivated for their nuts, clonal (grafted) trees of the same cultivar cannot pollinate each other because of their self-incompatibility. Two or more cultivars must be planted together for successful pollination. Seedlings (grown from hickory nuts) will usually have sufficient genetic variation.\n\n\n\n"}

It also contains interviews and statements from military historians and veterans, and looks into what mistakes Hitler made during the war and what he could have potentially done differently in order to win.\n\n\nCritical reception for \"How Hitler Lost the War\" was mostly positive. \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the movie a B- but commented that the film's thesis was \"dubious\". The \"Chicago Sun-Times\" praised the documentary and called it \"a fascinating re-examination of the misdirection of one of the greatest war machines the world has ever known\". In contrast, the \"New York Times\" stated that the film was \"sporadically interesting but far from persuasive\" and noted that it lacked a contrary analysis of the material.

{"id": "582423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=582423", "title": "Irminsul", "text": "Irminsul\n\nAn Irminsul (Old Saxon, probably \"great/mighty pillar\" or \"arising pillar\") was a sacral pillar-like object attested as playing an important role in the Germanic paganism of the Saxon people. The oldest chronicle describing an Irminsul refers to it as a tree trunk erected in the open air. The purpose of the Irminsuls and the implications thereof have been the subject of considerable scholarly discourse and speculation for hundreds of years.\n\nA Germanic god Irmin, inferred from the name Irminsul and the tribal name Irminones, is sometimes presumed to have been the national god or demi-god of the Saxons. It has been suggested that \"Irmin\" was more probably an aspect or epithet of some other deity – most likely Wodan (Odin). Irmin might also have been an epithet of the god Ziu (Tyr) in early Germanic times, only later transferred to Odin, as certain scholars subscribe to the idea that Odin replaced Tyr as the chief Germanic deity at the onset of the Migration Period. This was the favored view of early 20th century Nordicist writers, but it is not generally considered likely in modern times.\n\nThe Old Norse form of \"Irmin\" is \"Jörmunr\", which just like \"Yggr\" was one of the names of Odin. Yggdrasil (\"Yggr's horse\") was the yew or ash tree from which Odin sacrificed himself, and which connected the nine worlds. Jakob Grimm connects the name \"Irmin\" with Old Norse terms like \"iörmungrund\" (\"great ground\", i.e. the Earth) or \"iörmungandr\" (\"great snake\", i.e. the Midgard serpent).\n\nAccording to the Royal Frankish Annals (772 AD), during the Saxon wars, Charlemagne is repeatedly described as ordering the destruction of the chief seat of their religion, an Irminsul. The Irminsul is described as not being far from Heresburg (now Obermarsberg), Germany. Jacob Grimm states that \"strong reasons\" point to the actual location of the Irminsul as being approximately away, in the Teutoburg Forest and states that the original name for the region \"Osning\" may have meant \"Holy Wood.\"\n\nThe Benedictine monk Rudolf of Fulda (AD 865) provides a description of an Irminsul in chapter 3 of his Latin work \"De miraculis sancti Alexandri\". Rudolf's description states that the Irminsul was a great wooden pillar erected and worshipped beneath the open sky and that its name, Irminsul, signifies universal all-sustaining pillar.\n\nClive Tolley has argued that Widukind of Corvey in a passage of his \"Deeds of the Saxons\" (c. 970) is in fact describing an \"ad hoc\" Irminsul erected to celebrate the Saxon leader Hadugato's victory over the Thuringians in 531. Widukind says the Saxons set up an altar to their god of victory, whose body they depicted as a wooden column:\n\nWhen morning was come they set up an eagle at the eastern gate, and erecting an altar of victory they celebrated appropriate rites with all due solemnity, according to their ancestral superstition: to the one whom they venerate as their god of Victory they give the name of Mars, and the bodily characteristics of Hercules, imitating his physical proportion by means of wooden columns, and in the hierarchy of their gods he is the Sun, or as the Greeks call him, Apollo. From this fact the opinion of those men appears somewhat probable who hold that the Saxons were descended from the Greeks, because the Greeks call Mars Hirmin or Hermes, a word which we use even to this day, either for blame or praise, without knowing its meaning.\n\nWidukind is confused, however, about the name of the god, since the Roman Mars and the Greek Hermes do not correspond. Tolley supposes that the name Hirmin, of which Widukind does not know the meaning, is not to be related to Hermes, but to Irmin, the dedicatee of the Irminsul.\n\nUnder Louis the Pious in the 9th century, a stone column was dug up at Obermarsberg in Westphalia, Germany and relocated to the Hildesheim cathedral in Hildesheim, Lower Saxony, Germany. The column was reportedly then used as a candelabrum until at least the late 19th century. In the 13th century, the destruction of the Irminsul by Charlemagne was recorded as having still been commemorated at Hildesheim on the Saturday after Laetare Sunday.\n\nThe commemoration was reportedly done by planting two poles six feet high, each surmounted by a wooden object one foot in height shaped like a pyramid or a cone on the cathedral square. The youth then used sticks and stones in an attempt to knock over the object. This custom is described as existing elsewhere in Germany, particularly in Halberstadt where it was enacted on the day of Laetare Sunday by the Canons themselves.\n\nAwareness of the significance of the concept seems to have persisted well into Christian times. For example, in the twelfth-century \"Kaiserchronik\" an Irminsul is mentioned in three instances:\n\nConcerning the origin of the Wednesday:\n\nConcerning Julius Caesar:\n\nConcerning Nero:\n\nA number of theories surround the subject of the Irminsul.\n\nIn Tacitus' \"Germania\", the author mentions rumors of what he describes as \"Pillars of Hercules\" in land inhabited by the Frisii that had yet to be explored. Tacitus adds that these pillars exist either because Hercules actually did go there or because the Romans have agreed to ascribe all marvels anywhere to Hercules' credit. Tacitus states that while Drusus Germanicus was daring in his campaigns against the Germanic tribes, he was unable to reach this region, and that subsequently no one had yet made the attempt. Connections have been proposed between these \"Pillars of Hercules\" and later accounts of the Irminsuls. Hercules was probably frequently identified with Thor by the Romans due to the practice of \"interpretatio romana\".\n\nAccording to one particularly well-known suggestion, an Irminsul was situated at or near the Externsteine, a famous rock formation near Detmold, Germany. A Christian relief on the Externsteine (see photo above) depicts what has been described as a bent tree-like design at the feet of Nicodemus. This artwork, variously dated to the early ninth to early twelfth century AD, is popularly believed to represent the bent or fallen Irminsul beneath a triumphant Christianity.\n\nWhile both the artwork and the Irminsul were known to scholars for centuries - Goethe for example discussed the relief in detail -, they were not connected until the 1929 interpretation of lay archaeologist Wilhelm Teudt. In 1934 to 1935, the Ahnenerbe undertook extensive fieldwork in an attempt to uncover material evidence of the use of the Externsteine as a place of Germanic paganism worship, yet no such evidence was found.\n\nFew modern scholars consider it anything but an outright invention of Teudt, who did not provide evidence to back his claims.\n\nToday it is generally accepted by historians that there is no historic attestation connecting the Externsteine to the Irminsul. Certainly, the Eresburg was only about 45 kilometers (c.28 miles) from the Externsteine, and there indeed was an Irminsul \"near the Externsteine\", but extensive archaeological studies of the Externsteine have failed to yield any material evidence for their use as a sacred site between Mesolithic and pre-Christian times. Thermoluminescence dating of firesites suggests that the site was occasionally used as a rock shelter in Saxon times, but apparently not to the extent one would expect from a major place of worship.\n\nComparisons have been made between the Irminsul and the Jupiter Columns that were erected along the Rhine in Germania around the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE. Scholarly comparisons were once made between the Irminsul and the Jupiter Columns; however, Rudolf Simek states that the columns were of Gallo-Roman religious monuments, and that the reported location of the Irminsul in Eresburg does not fall within the area of the Jupiter Column archaeological finds.\n\nA depiction of an Irminsul based on the Externsteine relief (shaped back into a vertical position) is used in some currents of Germanic Neopaganism.\n\n\n"}

Isopycnals are often displayed graphically to help visualize \"layers\" of water in the ocean or gases in the atmosphere in a similar manner to how contour lines are used in topographic maps to help visualize topography.\n\nIn oceanography, isopycnals are used to display the vertical distribution of water density. In a body of water, as the depth increases, so does the density. Varying degrees of salinity, temperature, and pressure act to modify the density of water, and the denser water always lies below the less dense water. This creates distinguishable layers of water with differing physical properties. This phenomenon is called stratification. The strata are held in place by the large differences in physical and chemical properties between layers that prevent mixing. Turbulence can disturb boundaries between the layers, causing them to bend, which causes the isopycnals to appear uneven. The ways in which the isopycnals are transformed can be used by oceanographers to identify the force that caused the underwater disturbance.\n\nIn meteorology, isopycnals are used to display different layers of gases in the atmosphere. In the atmosphere, varying degrees of humidity, temperature, and pressure change the density of air. Isopycnals are not used in meteorology as frequently as they are in oceanography, since the density gradients observed in the atmosphere are typically gradual, unlike in stratified bodies of water. In these cases, isopycnals are less relevant, as they do not display any substantial features.\n\n"}

They are typically depicted as green, human-like beings with webbed hands and feet, with a turtle-like carapace on their backs. A depression on its head called its \"dish\" (\"sara\") retains water, and if this is damaged or its liquid is spilled the kappa is severely weakened.\n\nThe kappa are known to favor cucumbers and love to engage in sumo wrestling. They are often accused of assaulting humans in water and removing a mythical organ called the \"shirikodama\" from their victim's anus.\n\nThere are more than eighty other names associated with the \"kappa\" in different regions, including \"kawappa\", \"gawappa\", \"kawako\", \"gatarō\", \"mizuchi\".\n\nThe name \"kappa\" is a combination of the words \"kawa\" (river) and \"wappa\", a variant form of 童 \"warawa\" (also \"warabe\") \"child\". The \"kappa\" are also known regionally by at least eighty other names such as \"kawappa\", \"kawako\", \"kawatarō\", \"gawappa\", \"kōgo\", \"mizushi\", \"mizuchi\", \"suitengu\".\n\nIts names \"kawaso\" meaning \"otter\", \"dangame\" \"soft-shelled turtle\", and \"enkō\" \"monkey\" suggest its outward resemblance to these animals. The name \"komahiki\" or \"steed-puller\" alludes to its reputed penchant to drag away horses.\n\nThe kappa has been known as \"kawako\" in Izumo (Shimane Prefecture) where Lafcadio Hearn was based, and \"gatarō\" was the familiar name of it to folklorist Kunio Yanagita from Hyogo Prefecture.\n\nThe \"kappa\" is said to be roughly humanoid in form and about the size of a child, inhabiting the ponds and rivers of Japan. It is typically greenish in color (or yellow-blue), and either scaly or slimy skinned, with webbed hands and feet, with a turtle-like carapace on its back.\n\nOne peculiar trait is that it has a cavity on its head called a \"sara\" (\"dish\", \"bowl\", or \"plate (dishware)\") that retains water or some sort of liquid, which is regarded as the source of the \"kappa\"'s power or life force. This cavity must be full whenever a \"kappa\" is away from the water; if it ever dries out, or if its water is spilled, \"kappa\" loses its power and may even die. The \"kappa\" are sometimes said to smell like fish and they can swim like them.\n\nAccording to some accounts, its arms are connected to each other through the torso and can slide from one side to the other. While they are primarily water creatures, they do on occasion venture onto land. When they do, the \"dish\" on their head can be covered with a metal cap for protection.\n\nA hairy \"kappa\" is called a .\n\n\"Kappa\" are usually seen as mischievous troublemakers or trickster figures. Their pranks range from the relatively innocent, such as looking up women's kimonos, to the malevolent, such as drowning people and animals, kidnapping children, raping women and at times eating human flesh. Though sometimes menacing, it may also behave amicably towards humans.\n\nFolk beliefs claim the cucumber as their traditional favorite meal. At festivals, offerings of cucumber are frequently made to the kappa. Sometimes the kappa is said to have other favorite foods, such as the Japanese eggplant, \"soba\" (buckwheat noodles), \"nattō\" (fermented soybeans), or \"kabocha\".\n\nIn Edo (old Tokyo), there used to be a tradition where people would write the names of their family members on cucumbers and send them afloat into the streams to mollify the \"kappa\", to prevent the family from coming to harm in the streams. In some regions, it was customary to eat cucumbers before swimming as protection, but in others it was believed that this act would guarantee an attack.\n\nA cucumber-filled sushi roll is known as \"kappamaki\".\n\nAs water monsters, \"kappa\" have been blamed for drownings, and are often said to try to lure people into water and pull them in with their great skill at wrestling. They are sometimes said to take their victims for the purpose of drinking their blood, eating their livers, or gaining power by taking their , a mythical ball said to contain the soul, which is located inside the anus.\n\n\"Kappa\" have been used to warn children of the dangers lurking in rivers and lakes, as \"kappa\" have been often said to try to lure people to water and pull them in. Even today, signs warning about \"kappa\" appear by bodies of water in some Japanese towns and villages.\n\n\"Kappa\" are also said to victimize animals, especially horses and cows. The motif of the \"kappa\" trying to drown a horse is found all over Japan.\n\nLafcadio Hearn wrote of a story in Kawachimura near Matsue where a horse-stealing kappa was captured and made to write a sworn statement vowing never to harm people again.\n\nIn many versions the \"kappa\" is dragged by the horse to the stable where it is most vulnerable, and it is there it is forced to submit a writ of promise not to misbehave.\n\nIt was believed that there were a few means of escape if one was confronted with a \"kappa\". \"Kappa\" are obsessed with politeness, so if a person makes a deep bow, it will return the gesture. This results in the kappa spilling the water held in the \"dish\" (\"sara\") on its head, rendering it unable to leave the bowing position until the plate is refilled with water from the river in which it lives. If a person refills it, the \"kappa\" will serve that person for all eternity. A similar weakness of the \"kappa\" involves its arms, which can easily be pulled from its body. If an arm is detached, the \"kappa\" will perform favors or share knowledge in exchange for its return.\n\nAnother method of defeat involves \"shogi\" or \"sumo\" wrestling: a \"kappa\" sometimes challenges a human being to wrestle or engage in other tests of skill. This tendency is easily used to encourage the \"kappa\" to spill the water from its \"sara\". One notable example of this method is the folktale of a farmer who promises his daughter's hand in marriage to a \"kappa\" in return for the creature irrigating his land. The farmer's daughter challenges the \"kappa\" to submerge several gourds in water. When the \"kappa\" fails in its task, it retreats, saving the farmer's daughter from the marriage. \"Kappa\" have also been driven away by their aversion to iron, sesame, or ginger.\n\n\"Kappa\" are not entirely antagonistic to human beings.\n\nOnce befriended, \"kappa\" may perform any number of tasks for human beings, such as helping farmers irrigate their land. Sometimes, they bring fresh fish, which is regarded as a mark of good fortune for the family that receives it. They are also highly knowledgeable about medicine, and legend states that they taught the art of bone setting to human beings.\n\nAlong with the \"oni\" and the \"tengu\", the \"kappa\" is among the best-known \"yōkai\" in Japan.\n\nThe kappa is known by various names of the creature vary by region and local folklore. In Shintō, they are often considered to be an avatar (\"keshin\") of the Water Deity or \"suijin\".\n\nShrines are dedicated to the worship of \"kappa\" as water deity in such places as Aomori Prefecture or Miyagi Prefecture. There were also festivals meant to placate the \"kappa\" in order to obtain a good harvest, some of which still take place today. These festivals generally took place during the two equinoxes of the year, when the \"kappa\" are said to travel from the rivers to the mountains and vice versa.\n\nThe best known place where it has been claimed Kappa reside is in the waters of \"Tōno \" in the Iwate Prefecture. The nearby In Tōno, there is a Buddhist temple that has komainu dog statues with depressions on their heads reminiscent of the water-retaining dish on the kappa's heads, said to be dedicated to the \"kappa\" which according to legend helped extinguish a fire at the temple. The Kappa is also venerated at the \"Sogenji\" Buddhist temple in the Asakusa district of Tokyo where according to tradition, a mummified arm of a Kappa is enshrined within the chapel hall since 1818.\n\nIn his \"Tōno Monogatari\", Kunio Yanagita records a number of beliefs from the Tōno area about women being accosted and even impregnated by \"kappa\". Their offspring were said to be repulsive to behold, and were generally buried.\n\nSimilar folklore can be found in Asia and Europe. The Japanese folklore creature \"Kappa\" is known in Chinese folklore as 水鬼 \"Shui Gui\", Water Ghost, or water monkey and may also be related to the Kelpie of Scotland and the Neck of Scandinavia. Like the Japanese description of the beast, in Chinese and in Scandinavian lore this beast is infamous for kidnapping and drowning people as well as horses. The Siyokoy of the Philippine islands is also known for kidnapping children by the water's edge. A frog-face vodyanoy is known in Russian mythology. Green human-like being named \"vodnik\" is widely known in western Slavic folklore and tales, especially in Czech republic or Slovakia.\n\nMizuki Shigeru wrote about kappa in his work \"Kappa no Sanpei\" and a bronze statue of a kappa has been installed on the road named after him in Tottori.\n\nIn Japan, the character Sagojō (Sha Wujing) is conventionally depicted as a \"kappa\": he being a comrade of the magic monkey Gokū in the Chinese story \"Journey to the West\".\n\nHellboy fights a kappa in the animated \"\". The kappa tries to steal the Sword of Storms from Hellboy but loses after a local Japanese man (who was carving the names of the local villages into cucumbers so that the villages wouldn’t get eaten by the Kappa) advises Hellboy to \"spill his water\" - having done so the kappa becomes weak and eventually shrivels up.\n\nKappas are a recurring image in David Peace's novel \"Patient X\", about the life and work of Ryūnosuke Akutagawa.\n\nIn the Cartoon Network series \"OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes\", KO's friend Dendy is revealed to be a kappa. \n\nKappas appear in some of the Story of Seasons video games, often providing gifts if the player throws fish or cucumbers into their ponds. It is also possible for the protagonist in More Friends of Mineral Town to marry a Kappa. \nIn , a Kappa is seen as a circus attraction.\n\n\n"}

Edosians have an orange complexion, two yellow eyes, three arms and three dog-like legs. Navigator Lieutenant Arex was introduced in \"\", but his planet of origin, Edos, was mentioned only in background material. Passing references to Edosian flora and fauna have been made in episodes of \"\" and \"\". In some tie-in novels and short stories, Arex is mentioned as actually being a Triexian, with the Edosians being a near-identical race.\n\nEl-Aurians (referred to as a Race of Listeners by Dr. Tolian Soran, the El-Aurian antagonist in \"Star Trek Generations\") are a humanoid race first introduced in the second season of \"\" with the character Guinan. The species was named in the \"\" episode \"\".\n\nEl-Aurians appear outwardly identical to humans, and have a variety of ethnic types, with both dark- and light-skinned members of the race being shown on various \"Star Trek\" movies and television episodes. They can live well over 700 years. They are considered a race of listeners and often appear patient and wise.\n\nEl-Auria, the El-Aurian homeworld, was located in the Delta Quadrant and was destroyed by the Borg in the mid-23rd century. Few survived, and those who did were scattered throughout the galaxy. Some of the refugees came to the United Federation of Planets.\n\nAt the start of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", the Ferengi are a considered mysterious race who care only about profit. They feature as major characters in \"Deep Space Nine\".\n\nThe Jem'Hadar are characters in the TV series \"\", first introduced in the episode \"The Jem'Hadar\". They are the shock troops of the powerful Dominion located in the Gamma Quadrant. Genetically engineered for strength and resolve, they are also short-lived and believe that \"victory is life.\" They are bred to perceive the Founders, enigmatic shape-shifters who rule the massive Dominion, as gods and are incapable of harming them. The Jem'Hadar's numbers are unknown, but they are produced by the thousands as needed.\n\nConceived as \"more than just another fearsome alien\", the \"Deep Space Nine\" makeup department searched for concepts depicting \"toughness and resiliency\" in the design of the Jem'Hadar. The final design was based on a rhinoceros, with some added ceratopian traits. Originally designed on the premise that they were all clones, the first Jem'Hadar seen onscreen were all made to look identical to one another, though as they became more deeply woven into the storylines, each Jem'Hadar was given a distinctive look.\n\nThe Kazon aliens were introduced on \"\"\n\nThe Klingons are a warrior race.\n\nA cat-like race introduced in \"Star Trek: The Animated Series\". Kzinti society is a male dominate race of warriors (they prefer to use the term \"Heroes\") led by the Patriarch. Kzinti Heros have much in common with Klingon warriors, in that they highly value courage, fighting prowess, and consider personal honor of highest priority. The one racial \"flaw\" that Kzinti have is overconfidence, which manifests itself in a tendency to attack before they are truly ready. This is because they believe that combat, with the removal of all challenge and risk (i.e. certain success), lessens the honor gained in battle. Kzinti Heros place great pride in the scars they receive in battle, they also respect valiant and fierce opponents of other races, ensuring the bodies of these impressive alien warriors are stuffed and placed on honorable memorial display on Kzin, (the Kzinti home world).\n\nKzinti male are larger than their more docile females and humans They somewhat resemble a bipedal, barrel-chested, tiger-furred \"tabby\". Their tails are naked (rat like) and their ears have spines (resembling a section of a parasol.)\n\nA race native to the Delta Quadrant with a lifespan of only nine years.\n\nFurther characteristic:\nBone ears and various psychic mind abilities.\n\nThe Organians are incorporeal energy creatures (\"pure energy, pure thought\") with no precise physical location in the universe. After the climax of the episode \"Errand of Mercy\", Spock comments that they are \"as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the amoeba.\" They assumed humanoid form to \"interact\" with the Federation representatives and the Klingons. They render all weapons belonging to the hostile parties inoperable through extreme heat, and then vanish.\n\nThe Organians were a race of beings who had evolved to a point of being pure conceptual beings, essence of thought with no corporeal bodies. In some ways they were similar to Q for power levels and abilities. In the novel \"Q Strike\", the Organians appear to observe a battle between members of the Q Continuum and other seemingly omnipotent beings from the \"Star Trek\" universe. The original Q identifies them after being asked by Captain Jean-Luc Picard who they are, and is rather dismissive, remarking that \"compared to their code of noninvolvement, your Prime Directive is practically an incitement to riot.\"\n\nThe Organians also appeared on \"\" in the episode \",\" where they observed members of the crew infected with a silicon-based virus to decide whether or not they should make first contact with humans. They did not technically appear onscreen; they only manifested themselves by possessing the bodies of several members of the \"Enterprise\" crew.\n\nOrions are a green-skinned, humanoid alien species in the \"Star Trek\" universe. An Orion was first portrayed as an illusion in the original \"Star Trek\" pilot, but wasn't seen in the broadcast series until this original pilot was incorporated into a two-part episode (episodes 11 and 12) in the first season. Orions have also been portrayed in \"\", \"\", \"\" and \"\". Rachel Nichols played Orion Starfleet cadet Gaila in the 2009 \"Star Trek\" film.\n\nThe Pakled are a species of space-faring humanoids who obtain technology from other races (rather than developing it themselves), often through trickery. They first appeared in the \"TNG\" episode \"Samaritan Snare\", where the Pakled ship \"Mondor\" feigned being in need of repairs. After Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge transported to the \"Mondor\" and completed repairs, the Pakled captured him and demanded weapons technologies. The Pakled do not appear again, but are mentioned in the \"TNG\" episode \"\" as the Pakleds inadvertently having rescued Data's brother Lore, who was beamed into open space at the end of \"Datalore\".\n\nQ is the name of a continuum and members of the continuum.\n\nRomulans are humanoid extraterrestrials that appear in every \"Star Trek\" television series, where members of their race often serve as antagonists. \nThey prominently feature in the film \"Star Trek Nemesis\".\n\nSpecies 8472 appeared in four episodes of \"Star Trek: Voyager\". While passing through Borg space, \"Voyager\" encounters Species 8472, a race that surpasses the Borg in combat prowess.\n\nOn \"\", Neelix is a Talaxian.\n\nThe Tellarites first appeared in \"Journey to Babel\". (They have an odd facial appearance, represented by the actors wearing converted pig masks.) Culturally, they are known for their love of arguing and blunt, forceful speech, what most other cultures would consider rude; if Tellarite speech is answered in kind, they will typically consider it an honor.\n\nThe Thasians are a psionically powerful, non-corporeal species, native to the planet Thasus. Until the 23rd century, the Federation had never encountered the Thasians and thus believed them to be a myth. They appeared in \"Charlie X\" on the Original Series.\n\nThe Tholians are an extremely xenophobic, non-humanoid hermaphroditic species with a propensity for precision. In Star Trek episode \"The Tholian Web\",Spock make the remark when fired upon by the Tholians: \"The renowned Tholian punctuality\". They first appear in the original series episode, \"The Tholian Web\". Tholian biology required high temperatures around 480 Kelvin (207 °C, 404 °F). They could tolerate lower temperatures for a brief period of time; if they were exposed to temperatures around 380 Kelvin or less, their carapace would crack. This was painful or distressing; a Tholian subjected to such a temperature regime could be coerced to cooperate. In temperatures even lower, a Tholian would freeze solid and shatter. (ENT: \"Future Tense\", \"In a Mirror, Darkly\")\n\nTribbles are a petlike species who hate Klingons. Two Star Trek TV shows featuring them are \"The Trouble With Tribbles\" (1967) and \"Trials and Tribble-ations\" (1996).\n\nHumanoid species that are distinct in that they are a symbiotic species. The outward appearance is the host. The symbiont is revered and passes from host to host carrying all the memories, skills, and experiences of each prior host.\n\nThe Trill made their debut on television in the \"\" episode \"\" (May 11, 1991), and were further developed as the species of successive main-cast characters of the television show \"\" which made its debut on television with the two-part opener \"\" (broadcast January 3, 1993). This species was also briefly represented as a holonovel character corresponding to Ensign Harry Kim on Voyager in \"\" (April 18, 2001).\n\nTrill have been studied in analysis of the biology of \"Star Trek\", especially in regards to the symbionts.\n\nThere are two contrasting concepts for Trill. One is that the symbiont is essentially an alien person, however, the joined Trill still mixes the original person with the memories and some of the personality of the symbiont. Only a small percentage of trill use symbionts. For joined trill the symbionts' memories and to some extent personalities are a synthesis with existing Trill's personality. Joined trill have been studied in the philosophies of Star Trek, in particular whether a person is essentially the sum of their memories (the philosopher Locke's \"memory theory\"). This concept was explored in the \"Star Trek:Deep Space Nine\" television episode \"\". (see Personal_identity#Locke's_conception)\n\nThe contrasting philosophy of the symbiont is called the \"functionalism\" according to \"Star Trek and Philosophy: The Wrath of Kant\", in which people are defined by their actions as opposed to memories. The symbionts have been dismissed as a \"just memories\" rather than a true person, although in other cases they are described as a \"sentient symbiotic organism\".\n\nVorta are a member race of the Dominion. A small subspecies made primarily of genetically cloned humanoids. Vorta were created by the Dominion to execute military operations and the warrior class called the Jem Hadar.\n\nVulcans are a warp-capable humanoid species from the planet Vulcan, widely known for their logical minds and stoic culture.\n\n"}
{"id": "26093341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26093341", "title": "List of invasive species in the Everglades", "text": "List of invasive species in the Everglades\n\nInvasive species in the Everglades are exotic plants and animals that are not native to the area and have aggressively adapted to conditions in wilderness areas in southern Florida. The Everglades are a massive watershed in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Florida that drains overflow from the vast shallow Lake Okeechobee that is in turn fed by the Kissimmee River. The overflow forms a very shallow river about wide and long that travels about half a mile per day. The network of ecosystems created by the Everglades are surrounded by urban areas to the east in the South Florida metropolitan area, to the west by Naples and Fort Myers, and to the south by Florida Bay, a marine environment that receives fresh water from and is maintained by the Everglades. As it is surrounded on three sides and close to a major transportation and shipping center, it is particularly vulnerable to the importation of exotic species.\n\nIn the 20th century, Florida experienced a population surge unparalleled in the U.S., accompanied by rapid urban expansion made possible by draining portions of the Everglades. Flood control became a priority and the Central & South Florida Flood Control Project, from 1947 to 1971, constructed over of canals and flood control structures in South Florida. The widespread building created new habitats and disturbed established plant and animal communities. Many of the new residents or tourists in Florida were responsible for introducing plant species to the area by accident, or deliberately to improve landscaping. Many animals have been introduced similarly, and have either escaped or been released to proliferate on their own. Several terms are used to identify non-native species: exotic, invader, immigrant, colonist, introduced, nonindigenous, and naturalized. \"Naturalized\" usually refers to species that have adapted to a region over a long period of time, while \"invasive\" refers to particularly destructive or aggressive species.\n\nApproximately 26%. of all fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the United States—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Many of the biological controls like weather, disease, and consumers that naturally limit plants in their native environments do not exist in the Everglades, causing many to grow larger and multiply far beyond their average numbers in their native habitats. Similarly, animals often do not find the predators or natural barriers to reproduction in the Everglades as they do where they originated, thus they often reproduce more quickly and efficiently. Concerns over the quality of the Everglades were raised in the beginning of the 20th century, and by 2000 a federally funded initiative was enacted that gave Everglades restoration the distinction of being the largest planned environmental rehabilitation in history. Exotic species control falls under the management of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which has been compiling and disseminating information about invasive species since 1994. Control of invasive species costs $500 million a year, but of land in South Florida remains infested.\n\nAs the fields of ecology and environmental studies develop, exotic species attract more attention and their effects become more apparent. Mid-20th century biology texts about invading species reflected more complacency than alarm, as contemporary wisdom about them assumed the host environment would be largely immune. Everglades biologist Thomas Lodge writes that in the 1960s, evidence of non-native plant and animal life in South Florida was present but not particularly worthy of notice. Over the past decades, however, the number of exotic species and their spread has increased dramatically.\n\nThe Everglades hosts 1,301 species of native flora that are tropical or subtropical in nature, which arrived on the Florida peninsula about 5,000 years ago. Winds, water, and birds carried most of the tropical flora. The subtropical species spread from more northern locations. As of 2010 1,392 additional non-native plant species have been identified and established themselves in South Florida. A variety of avenues are available for species to be brought by humans deliberately or by accident: agricultural experiments, in shipping containers, or attached to vehicles. South Florida is a transportation hub for shipping and traffic between the U.S. and the Caribbean and Central and South America. In 1990, 333 million plants were brought into Miami International Airport. Both the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agriculture Sciences (IFAS) experiment with plants in laboratories throughout Florida.\n\nState, local, and federal government agencies spend millions of dollars to rid South Florida of invasive species and prevent more from entering the region. Plants that are imported to Florida are subject to classification as \"Restricted\" or \"Prohibited\", but a new designation is being considered \"Not Authorized Pending Plant Risk Analysis\", to allow scientists to assess what damage exotic plants may cause to the South Florida environment. A nonproft organization named The Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council lists exotic species as belonging in Category I: \"altering native plant communities by displacing native species, changing community structures or ecological functions, or hybridizing with natives\"; and Category II: \"increased in abundance or frequency but have not yet altered Florida plant communities to the extent shown by Category I\". More than 100 species have been placed in Category I, but a few have been singled out for the potential to cause the most destruction based on how rapidly they reproduce, their displacement of native flora by crowding, shading, or fire, excellent adaptations to conditions in the Everglades, and the potential to spread (or evidence that they have spread) into remote areas of the Everglades.\n\nAlthough the general effects of invasive animals is not as profound as plants, they are more noticeable in many instances and a constant reminder of the many exotic species in the region. A wildlife biologist and several construction workers near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed a scene where several iguanas sunning themselves in a canal were attacked by a spectacled caiman, to the surprise of all.\n\nAbout 12,500 species of insects are native to Florida, most of which naturally flew into the region from the Caribbean or Southeastern United States. An additional 1,000 have been identified as exotic. Insects create about $1 billion of damage to structures and agriculture in Florida each year. The tide of arriving insects is nearly impossible to control with the volume of goods and shipments coming into South Florida. Imported citrus is a major avenue for damaging insects. Twenty-one species have been imported and released to act as biological control agents: to impede the growth of invasive plants or counter the effects of other insects. Others, such as the Madagascan hissing cockroach (\"Gromphadorhina portentosa\") and European cricket (\"Acheta domesticus\") are sold as pets or fishing bait, and are then released into backyards. Similarly, aquatic invertebrates such as mussels, clams, snails, and melania find their ways into local waters from the bottoms of ships or in bilge holds. The aquarium trade also supplies enthusiasts with exotic species which are dumped or escape into waterways.\n\nExcluding insects and other arthropods, 192 exotic animal species have established themselves in Florida as of 2009. More than 50 species of fish have been introduced. Early recorded species were the pike killifish (\"Belonesox belizanus\") and oscar (\"Astronotus ocellatus\"). The extensive network of canals throughout South Florida allows many species to disperse more readily than they would under natural conditions as many regions in the Everglades go dry each year or experience extended drought periods. The overall impact of exotic fishes on the native populations and habitats is largely unknown.\n\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) initiated a task force to concentrate on identifying the most invasive animals. The agency created a list of \"Reptiles of Concern\" for the Burmese python, African rock python (\"Python sebae\"), amethystine python (\"Morelia amethystinus\"), reticulated python (\"Python reticulatus\"), green anaconda (\"Eunectes murinus\"), and the Nile monitor. Florida also began requiring owners to pay a permit fee of $100 a year and place microchips on the animals. These predators are included on the list for their formidable size and aggressive natures; animals that were in the Everglades before the list was created, however, are breeding in the wild. To combat the number of exotic snakes in the U.S., and specifically in South Florida, the U.S. Department of the Interior added four species of snakes—Burmese pythons, two subspecies of African rock pythons (northern and southern), and the yellow anaconda (\"Eunectes notaeus\")—to Lacey Act provisions, making their import into the U.S. illegal, in 2012. Exotic birds do not attract the same amount of attention. They too have been brought to Florida as part of the pet trade and escape, get released by dealers attempting to avoid quarantine restrictions, or escape from damaged cages and artificial habitats during tropical storms. Typically, however, most nonindigenous birds live closer to populated areas; some populations of birds establish themselves but decline for unapparent reasons.\n\nMore than 50 species of exotic mammals have been recorded in South Florida, at least 19 of which are self-sustaining. Colonies of feral mammals are established in or around the Everglades, including dogs, pigs, and cats. Wild animals native to other parts of the U.S. have also been established including nine-banded armadillos (\"Dasypus novemcinctus Linnaeus\"), coyotes (\"Canis latrans\"), and jaguarundi (\"Herpailurus yaguarondi\").\n\nFlorida has enacted laws to prohibit the release of exotic animals into the wild. To dissuade people from dumping animals, local authorities have begun holding \"Nonnative Amnesty Days\" in several Florida locations where pet owners who are no longer willing or able to take care of non-traditional pets such as snakes, lizards, amphibians, birds, and mammals—excluding dogs, cats, and ferrets—can deposit animals without being prosecuted for illegal dumping of exotic species. The FWC has furthermore allowed hunters permits to capture Reptiles of Concern in a specific hunting season in wildlife management areas, euthanize the animals immediately and sell the meat and hides.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7813004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7813004", "title": "List of off-season Atlantic hurricanes", "text": "List of off-season Atlantic hurricanes\n\nAn off-season Atlantic hurricane is a recorded tropical or subtropical cyclone that existed in the Atlantic basin outside of the official Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration currently defines the season as occurring between June 1 and November 30 each calendar year, which is when 97% of all Atlantic tropical cyclones occur. Peak activity is known to be between August and October. In the off-season, storms are most likely to occur in May, with approximately 60% of such storms occurring during that month. Occasionally, however, storms develop in or persist until December. As of 2018, there have been 89 off-season cyclones in the Atlantic hurricane database, which began in 1851. In addition, there were six storms before 1851, and one hurricane in 1863 that is not part of the official database.\n\nOff-season cyclones are most likely to occur in the central to western Atlantic Ocean, and most do not make landfall. Of the storms that did strike land, most affected areas surrounding the Caribbean Sea. Cumulatively, at least 441 deaths occurred due to the storms, primarily on the islands of Hispaniola and Cuba; a tropical storm in May 1948 struck the Dominican Republic to become the deadliest off-season storm. However, an unofficial hurricane in 1863 killed 110 people, in a shipwreck off Florida and on land. The same storm was estimated to have reached winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), making it the strongest hurricane between December to May; the strongest currently in the official database was a March hurricane in 1908 that reached winds of 100 mph (160 km/h). In addition, the strongest off-season cyclone to make landfall in the United States was Tropical Storm Beryl in 2012, which made landfall near Jacksonville Beach, Florida with 65 mph (100 km/h) winds. The most recent off-season storm is Tropical Storm Alberto in May 2018.\n\nIn 1938, the United States Weather Bureau began issuing tropical cyclone warnings as a collaborative observation network for cities along the U.S. coastline, and the season was defined between June 15 and November 15. In 1964, the season was extended to begin on June 1 and end on November 30, which remains the official length of the season. About 97% of all tropical cyclones form within this time span, and activity usually peaks between August and October. After Tropical Storm Ana formed in May 2015, former American Meteorological Society president Marshall Shepherd used Twitter to question whether the season should begin earlier. James Franklin of the National Hurricane Center believed there was little advantage to changing it because of the rarity of off-season storms, noting that May storms only formed on average once every six years since the advent of satellite imagery. Franklin opined that the season could begin on May 15 with little difficulty, coinciding with the beginning of the Pacific hurricane season, but an earlier start would be costlier and interfere with off-season work.\n\nTropical cyclones have been named in the Atlantic since the 1947 Atlantic hurricane season, and subtropical cyclones have been recognized in HURDAT since 1968. The National Hurricane Center issues names for tropical and subtropical cyclones once their winds reach 39 mph (63 km/h). Before 1950, storms are numbered based on their appearance in the Atlantic hurricane database, although tropical depressions are unnumbered. Storms before 1851 are unofficial and are not part of the official Atlantic hurricane best track. In addition, a hurricane from May 1863, labeled \"Amanda\", is included after being rediscovered in 2013.\n\nThe wind speeds listed are maximum one-minute average sustained winds, and the pressure is the minimum barometric pressure; tropical cyclones listed with N/A under pressure indicates there is no known estimated pressure. For deaths, \"None\" indicates that there were no reports of fatalities; death tolls listed as \"several\" mean there were fatalities reported, but an exact total is unavailable. For both deaths and damage, N/A refers to no known total, although such storms may have impacted land. The damage totals are the United States dollar of the year of the storm.\n\nIn the official Atlantic hurricane database, which dates back to 1851, the first storm to occur outside of the current season was in 1865 in the Caribbean Sea. In the database, 83 tropical or subtropical cyclones have existed between December and May, most recently Subtropical Storm Alberto in 2018. In addition, there were at least five storms in May and another in December before the start of the official database.\n\nStorms were most likely to occur in May, followed by December. Out of all recorded storms in the database, only one cyclone was reported in the month of March; the 1908 March hurricane, as well as one tropical storm in February, which was the 1952 Groundhog Day Storm. In addition, only three tropical or subtropical cyclones formed in April – a subtropical storm in 1992, Tropical Storm Ana of 2003, and Tropical Storm Arlene of 2017. A hurricane in 1938, a tropical storm in 1951, a subtropical storm in 1978, and Hurricane Alex of 2016 occurred in January. Of all cyclones during the off-season, Hurricane Lili in 1984 lasted the longest, for a total of 12 days. Hurricane Epsilon, which formed in November, maintained hurricane status for five days in December 2005, longer than any other storm in December; the previous record was two and a half days, set by Hurricane Lili in 1984. Additionally, Hurricane Alice in 1954–1955 and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005–2006 were the only recorded cyclones to have spanned two calendar years.\n\nOf the off-season storms that struck land, portions of the Caribbean were affected most. Hurricane Alice was the only of the cyclones to strike land as a hurricane, doing so to islands in the northern Lesser Antilles; it caused locally heavy rainfall and moderate damage. No hurricanes have ever made landfall in the United States during December, although at one point a storm in 1925 was believed to have done this. One century earlier, a hurricane formed in the western Caribbean and struck Florida on or before June 3, which was the earliest date for a United States hurricane landfall. However, there is an unofficial hurricane in 1863 that struck the Florida panhandle, killing 110 people. The deadliest official off-season storm was a tropical storm in May 1948, which killed 80 people in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe year with the most off-season storms was 1887, with a total of five existing in the off-season. The 1951 season had four, one of which a depression. Several others had three tropical cyclones, of which only 2003 had three tropical storms. The 1908 and 1951 seasons were the only ones with two hurricanes forming in the off-season. In seven seasons, there were storms both prior to the start of the season as well as after the season ended, those being 1887, 1911, 1951, 1953, 1954, 2003, and 2007; all but 1911 had tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm status before and after the season.\n\n\n"}

Most of the Llanos de Moxos lies within the departments of El Beni, Cochabamba, La Paz, Pando, and Santa Cruz. The Llanos de Moxos occupies the southwestern corner of the Amazon basin, and the region is crossed by numerous rivers that drain the eastern slope of the Andes Mountains. The low relief of the savannas, coupled with wet season rains and snowmelt from the Andes, cause up to half the land to flood seasonally.\n\nThe Llanos de Moxos is surrounded by tropical moist forests; the Southwestern Amazonian moist forests to the north, west, and south, and the Madeira-Tapajós moist forests to the east.\n\nThe climate of the Llanos de Moxos is tropical, with pronounced wet and dry seasons. The wet season generally extends from December to May, and annual rainfall ranges from 1300 in the east to 2000 mm in the west.\n\nThe ecoregion comprises a mosaic of savannas and wetlands, with islands of forest and gallery forests along rivers. Flooding and fire are important ecological factors.\n\nThe Llanos de Moxos is home to the blue-throated macaw (\"Ara glaucogularis\"), which is critically endangered.\n\nThe Llanos de Moxos was the setting for many complex pre-Columbian societies, many of which constructed agricultural earthworks such as raised fields, causeways, canals and mounds. These earthworks were built and used from about 1100 BC until about AD 1450, so far as can be told from archeological remains which do not preserve well in the tropics. The earthworks exceed the Giza pyramids in size and arouse similar speculation as to the means by which they were constructed.

The mechanism was first proposed in the 1970s and was quickly identified as a means by which even gradual anthropogenic warming could lead to rapid sea level rise. In Antarctica, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the Aurora Subglacial Basin, and the Wilkes Basin are each grounded below sea level and are inherently subject to MISI.\n\nThe term \"marine ice sheet\" describes an ice sheet whose base rests on ground below sea level, and \"marine ice sheet instability\" describes the inherent precarious nature of marine ice sheets due to Archimedes' principle. Because seawater is denser than ice, marine ice sheets can only remain stable where the ice is thick enough for its mass to exceed the mass of the seawater displaced by the ice. In other words, wherever ice exists below sea level, it is held in place only by the weight of overlying ice. As a marine ice sheet melts, the weight of the overlying ice decreases. If melt causes thinning beyond a critical threshold, the subaerial ice may no longer be heavy enough to prevent the submarine ice below it from lifting off the ground and floating away.\n\nThe location of grounding line, the boundary between the ice sheet and the floating ice shelves, is unstable in this case. The amount of ice flowing though the grounding line initially matches the accumulation of ice upstream. When the grounding line is pushed backwards, due to for instance melt by warm water, the ice sheet is more thick at the new location of the grounding line and total ice flowing through increases. As this leads the ice sheet to lose mass, the grounding line is pushed back even further and this self-reinforcing mechanism is the cause of the instability. Ice sheets of this type have accelerated ice sheet retreat.\n\nStrictly speaking the MISI theory is only valid if the ice shelves are free floating and not constrained in an embayment.\n\nThe initial perturbation or push-back of the grounding line might be caused by high water temperatures at the base of ice shelves so that melt increases (basal melt). The thinned ice shelves which stabilize the ice sheet, exert less of an buttressing effect (back stress).\n\nA related process known as \"Marine Ice Cliff Instability\" (MICI) posits that due to the physical characteristics of ice, subaerial ice cliffs exceeding ~90 meters in height are likely to collapse under their own weight, and could lead to runaway ice sheet retreat in a fashion similar to MISI. For an ice sheet grounded below sea level with an inland-sloping bed, ice cliff failure removes peripheral ice, which then exposes taller, more unstable ice cliffs, further perpetuating the cycle of ice front failure and retreat. Surface melt can further enhance MICI through ponding and hydrofracture.\n\nAccording to a 2016 published study, cold meltwater provides cooling of the ocean's surface layer, acting like a lid, and also affecting deeper waters by increasing subsurface ocean warming and thus facilitating ice melt.\nAnother theory discussed in 2007 for increasing warm bottom water is that that changes in air circulation patterns have led to increased upwelling of warm, deep ocean water along the coast of Antarctica and that this warm water has increased melting of floating ice shelves. An ocean model has shown how changes in winds can help channel the water along deep troughs on the sea floor, toward the ice shelves of outlet glaciers.\n\nIn West Antarctica, the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers have been identified to be potentially prone to MISI, and both glaciers have been rapidly thinning and accelerating in recent decades. In East Antarctica, Totten Glacier is the largest glacier known to be subject to MISI and its sea level potential is comparable to that of the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Totten Glacier has been losing mass nearly monotonically in recent decades, suggesting rapid retreat is possible in the near future, although the dynamic behavior of Totten Ice Shelf is known to vary on seasonal to interannual timescales. The Wilkes Basin is the only major submarine basin in Antarctica that is not thought to be sensitive to warming.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53481999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53481999", "title": "Net metering in New Mexico", "text": "Net metering in New Mexico\n\nNet metering in New Mexico is a set of state public policies that govern the relationship between solar customers (and customers with other types of renewable energy systems) and electric utility companies.\n\nNet metering refers to the interconnection of a renewable energy system to the power grid. It allows consumers who have their own renewable generation power systems to connect to the power grid with an electric meter that spins both forwards and backwards, depending on whether the consumer is adding energy to the grid or using energy from the grid. At the end of the month, the customer’s bill is based on the net amount of power that is drawn from the grid, minus the credits for excess power put into the grid.\n\nIn New Mexico, customers who have systems that produce up to 80 MW of electricity are able to sign up for net metering. This is the highest power rating eligible for net metering in the United States.\n\nThe three main utilities in New Mexico are PNM, Xcel Energy and El Paso Electric.\n\nOne benefit of net metering is that power is never wasted. When someone uses an isolated system that uses batteries that become fully charged while the system is still generating power, that excess power is wasted.\n\nCustomer-generators, businesses and industrial operations can qualify for net metering. Customer-generators have the added benefit of selling renewable energy credits (REC) back to their utility. (A customer-generator is a small producer--that is not an electric utility--of electricity which is net metered and connected to the electric grid. An example would be a homeowner who puts solar panels on his rooftop.)\n\nA utility-scale solar facility is a large facility that generates solar power and moves that power into the electric grid. Almost every utility-scale solar facility has what is known as a power purchase agreement with the utility. The agreement guarantees a market for the utility-scale solar facility’s energy for a fixed term of time. (Residential solar systems are not considered utility-scale).\n\nThe size of a utility-scale facility can vary. For example, some utility-scale facilities provide only enough power per megawatt to power a few hundred average homes. Others offer a lot more energy. Factors that play into this are location, the type of technology used, and the availability of sunlight.\n\nFor example, although not located in New Mexico, Recurrent Energies’ “Sunset Reservoir” project in San Francisco produces 5 megawatts of solar energy. It is built on top of enclosed reservoir in the middle of San Francisco. It is considered a utility-scale solar facility.\n\nFor customers with solar systems that can generate 10 kilowatts or less, the utility company has a choice in how they compensate that customer for net excess generation. The utility can give the customer a credit on their next bill equal to the utility’s energy rate (the costs that the utility pays for its own electricity), or crediting the customer for the kilowatt hours of electricity that they have supplied back to utility through the grid.\n\nIn New Mexico, a few technical requirements exist in order for a net metering system to be connected to the grid. First, the net metering system should have a visible means of disconnection allowing the utility to disconnect to system from the grid. Second, a net meter is required and should cost no more than $20. Third, there needs to be an inverter that disconnects when the grid goes down.\n\nThe system capacity limit is 80 megawatts.\n\nIn New Mexico the types of renewable technologies eligible for net metering are the following:\n\nSectors that can use net metering include commercial, industrial, local government, nonprofits, residential homes, schools, state and federal government, agricultural, and institutional.\n\nThe types of utilities that can participate in net metering are investor-owned utilities and electric cooperatives.\n\nUtilities that can participate are investor-owned utilities and electric cooperatives. When a customer leaves the utility, the utility must pay the customer for any unused credits.\n\nAccording to DSIRE, “Net metering is available to all \"qualifying facilities\" (QFs), as defined by the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), which pertains to renewable energy systems and combined heat and power systems up to 80 megawatts (MW) in capacity. There is no statewide cap on the aggregate capacity of net-metered systems.”\n\nAdditionally, all utilities that are subject regulation under the Public Regulation Commission’s (PRC) jurisdiction must offer net metering. Municipal utilities, which are not regulated by the PRC, are exempt.\n\nIn New Mexico, the decrease in prices for solar systems is driving the market for it. Many homeowners and commercial companies are purchasing solar systems to help offset the increase in electric utility bills. More financing options are available today in New Mexico, more solar companies are competing, and this is leading to an increase in market penetration.\n\nThe growth is predicted at 20% per year. As of early 2016, the market in the United States for solar systems had reached 1 million solar installations. This is equivalent to generating enough electricity to power 5.4 million homes, according to the national Solar Energy Industry Association.\n\nAccording to the \"Albuquerque Journal\", “New Mexico ranks 8th in the nation today in terms of installed solar capacity per capita.” It is estimated that the solar market in New Mexico has only experienced approximately 10% of market penetration.\n\nAccording to the \"Albuquerque Journal\", “As of year-end 2015, New Mexico had about 400 megawatts of installed capacity. That includes 85 MW of residential and commercial systems, and 316 MW of utility-scale generation scattered throughout the service territories of New Mexico’s public utilities and electric cooperatives.”\n\nFor all the installed solar capacity in the New Mexico, the Public Service Company of New Mexico accounts for around 41% of that. Their facilities include 15 different projects with a total of 107 MW of capacity, which according to the company, provides enough power 140,000 average homes.\n\nNew Mexico requires public utilities to get 15% of their electric generation from renewable sources. That number will increase to 20% by the year 2020.\n\nWithin the state, 60 different contracting and installation companies operate. These firms include national companies like SolarCity and ZingSolar.\n\nUp until the end of 2016, New Mexico offered a 10% state tax credit for solar installations. The tax credit began in 2008.\n\nSolar companies operating in New Mexico say they are okay to absorb the loss of the state tax credit, meaning that they don't believe it will affect their business. However, in addition to the loss of the tax credit, renewable energy payments from utilities to customers is also declining.\n\nIn addition to the state tax credit, which is over, the U.S. government gives a 30 percent tax credit for solar installations. In December 2015, Congress extended the program through the end of 2019.\n\nPNM and El Paso Electric Co. in southern New Mexico paid customers for each kilowatt hour of electricity they produced from their solar systems. These payments help customers and businesses offset the costs of installing their solar systems.\n\nIn addition to the payments, those companies offer net metering. Under net metering, people with solar systems can sell their excess electricity back to the utility company at a price equal to what the utility pays for its own electricity. Note that net metering is a separate system of payments from the renewable payments that utilities offer back to customers.\n\nFor example, 7,100 customers have signed up for the renewable payments from the utility PNM. In 2014, that number was only 4,400 customers.\n\nPayments from utilities back to customers decreased from $.13 per kilowatt hour in 2009 to $.025 by the end of 2015. As of the middle of 2016, PNM stopped accepting new applications because the number of people seeking the credits was more than the money available in the program.\n\nAccording to DSIRE, a program operated by the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, “If a customer has NEG [net energy generation] totaling less than $50 during a monthly billing period, the excess is carried over to the customer’s next monthly bill. If NEG exceeds $50 during a monthly billing period, the utility will pay the customer the following month for the excess.\n\n“The energy rate to be paid for the energy supplied by the QF [qualifying facility] in any month shall be the respective month's rate from the utility's current schedule on file with the PRC. Each utility shall file with the PRC its schedule containing monthly energy rates that will be applicable to the next twelve-month period.”\n\nAccording to a study by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, prices for the installation of residential and utility-scale solar generation plants went down by more than 50 percent between 2008 and 2014. In 2015, prices fell another 17 percent.\n\nAs of 2017, an average New Mexico residential system producing 4.4 kilowatts costs approximately $17,000 before tax credits and other incentives. After credits and incentives, the system would cost approximately $11,900. In 2009, that same system had cost $30,000. If a consumer chose to finance the system, they could pay around $99 a month.\n\nIn New Mexico there are two primary rules that govern the interconnection of a solar system to the utility grid:\nAccording to the New Mexico Solar Energy Association, “These rules apply wherever electricity service is regulated by the PRC. This includes the areas serviced by New Mexico's four investor owned utilities (IOUs) (which encompasses Santa Fe and Albuquerque for example), and the areas services by electric coops. It does not include municipal utilities (such as Los Alamos and Farmington), which are self-regulated.”\n\nAdditionally, “If the net-metered facility uses more power than it produces over a billing period, the utility may bill the customer for the net power used according to the rate structure that would apply to the customer if they had not connected as a net-metering facility.”\n\nThe solar industry in New Mexico is facing hurdles. Most utilities want to reduce incentives like net metering and charge customers more who have solar systems. The reason they want to do this is because the utilities maintain that their role in generating plants, transmitting and distributing electricity through distribution lines, and other fixed costs remain unchanged. They argue that solar customers are not financially contributing to those fixed costs.\n\nUtility-specific information on net metering can be found at the following websites:\nRegulations:\nIncentives:\nPrograms:\n"}

{"id": "24479046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24479046", "title": "Planetary mass", "text": "Planetary mass\n\nPlanetary mass is a measure of the mass of a planet-like object. Within the Solar System, planets are usually measured in the astronomical system of units, where the unit of mass is the solar mass (), the mass of the Sun. In the study of extrasolar planets, the unit of measure is typically the mass of Jupiter () for large gas giant planets, and the mass of Earth () for smaller rocky terrestrial planets.\n\nThe mass of a planet within the Solar System is an adjusted parameter in the preparation of ephemerides. There are three variations of how planetary mass can be calculated:\n\nThe choice of solar mass, , as the basic unit for planetary mass comes directly from the calculations used to determine planetary mass. In the most precise case, that of the Earth itself, the mass is known in terms of solar masses to twelve significant figures: the same mass, in terms of kilograms or other Earth-based units, is only known to five significant figures, which is less than a millionth as precise.\n\nThe difference comes from the way in which planetary masses are calculated. It is impossible to \"weigh\" a planet, and much less the Sun, against the sort of mass standards which are used in the laboratory. On the other hand, the orbits of the planets give a great range of observational data as to the relative positions of each body, and these positions can be compared to their relative masses using Newton's law of universal gravitation (with small corrections for General Relativity where necessary). To convert these relative masses to Earth-based units such as the kilogram, it is necessary to know the value of the Newtonian gravitational constant, \"G\". This constant is remarkably difficult to measure in practice, and its value is only known to a precision of one part in ten-thousand.\n\nThe solar mass is quite a large unit on the scale of the Solar System: 1.9884(2) kg. The largest planet, Jupiter, is 0.09% the mass of the Sun, while the Earth is about three millionths (0.0003%) of the mass of the Sun. Various different conventions are used in the literature to overcome this problem: for example, inverting the ratio so that one quotes the planetary mass in the 'number of planets' it would take to make up one Sun. Here, we have chosen to list all planetary masses in 'microSuns' – that is the mass of the Earth is just over three 'microSuns', or three millionths of the mass of the Sun – unless they are specifically quoted in kilograms.\n\nWhen comparing the planets among themselves, it is often convenient to use the mass of the Earth (\"M\" or ) as a standard, particularly for the terrestrial planets. For the mass of gas giants, and also for most extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs, the mass of Jupiter () is a convenient comparison.\n\nThe mass of a planet has consequences for its structure by having a large mass, especially while it is in the hand of process of formation. A body which is more than about one ten-thousandth of the mass of the Earth can overcome its compressive strength and achieve hydrostatic equilibrium: it will be roughly spherical, and since 2006 has been classified as a dwarf planet if it orbits around the Sun (that is, if it is not the satellite of another planet). Smaller bodies like asteroids are classified as \"small Solar System bodies\".\n\nA dwarf planet, by definition, is not massive enough to have gravitationally cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals: it is not known quite how large a planet must be before it can effectively clear its neighbourhood, but one tenth of the Earth's mass is certainly sufficient.\n\nThe smaller planets retain only silicates, and are terrestrial planets like Earth or Mars, though multiple-\"M\" super-Earths have been discovered. The interior structure of rocky planets is mass-dependent: for example, plate tectonics may require a minimum mass to generate sufficient temperatures and pressures for it to occur.\n\nIf the protoplanet grows by accretion to more than about , its gravity become large enough to retain hydrogen in its atmosphere. In this case, it will grow into a gas giant. If the planet then begins migration, it may move well within its system's frost line, and become a hot Jupiter orbiting very close to its star, then gradually losing small amounts of mass as the star's radiation strips its atmosphere.\n\nThe theoretical minimum mass a star can have, and still undergo hydrogen fusion at the core, is estimated to be about , though fusion of deuterium can occur at masses as low as 13 Jupiters.\n\nThe DE405/LE405 ephemeris from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a widely used ephemeris dating from 1998 and covering the whole Solar System. As such, the planetary masses form a self-consistent set, which is not always the case for more recent data (see below).\n\nWhere a planet has natural satellites, its mass is usually quoted for the whole system (planet + satellites), as it is the mass of the whole system which acts as a perturbation on the orbits of other planets. The distinction is very slight, as natural satellites are much smaller than their parent planets (as can be seen in the table above, where only the largest satellites are even listed).\n\nThe Earth and the Moon form a case in point, partly because the Moon is unusually large (just over 1% of the mass of the Earth) in relation to its parent planet compared with other natural satellites. There are also very precise data available for the Earth–Moon system, particularly from the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment (LLR).\n\nThe geocentric gravitational constant – the product of the mass of the Earth times the Newtonian gravitational constant – can be measured to high precision from the orbits of the Moon and of artificial satellites. The ratio of the two masses can be determined from the slight wobble in the Earth's orbit caused by the gravitational attraction of the Moon.\n\nThe construction of a full, high-precision Solar System ephemeris is an onerous task. It is possible (and somewhat simpler) to construct partial ephemerides which only concern the planets (or dwarf planets, satellites, asteroids) of interest by \"fixing\" the motion of the other planets in the model. The two methods are not strictly equivalent, especially when it comes to assigning uncertainties to the results: however, the \"best\" estimates – at least in terms of quoted uncertainties in the result – for the masses of minor planets and asteroids usually come from partial ephemerides.\n\nNevertheless, new complete ephemerides continue to be prepared, most notably the EPM2004 ephemeris from the Institute of Applied Astronomy of the Russian Academy of Sciences. EPM2004 is based on separate observations between 1913 and 2003, more than seven times as many as DE405, and gave more precise masses for Ceres and five asteroids.\n\nA new set of \"current best estimates\" for various astronomical constants was approved the 27th General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in August 2009. It includes masses for all the planets except the Earth–Moon system, as well as Eris, Pluto, Ceres, Vesta and Pallas: values for the masses of Eris, Pluto, Ceres, Vesta and Pallas are as given in the table above. Except for those of Mercury and Uranus, all the planetary masses have been revised since the DE405 ephemeris (1998).\n\nThe ratio of the mass of the Moon to the mass of the Earth is given as 1.(4), while the ratio of the mass of the Sun to the mass of the Earth can be calculated as the ratio of the heliocentric and geocentric gravitational constants: 332.(7), giving the mass of the Earth as 3.(6)  or 5.9722(6) kg.\n\n"}

Another setting for the eruption of very large amounts of volcanic material is in large igneous provinces, which can cover huge areas with lava and volcanic ash, causing long-lasting climate change (such as the triggering of a small ice age), which can threaten species with extinction. The Oruanui eruption of New Zealand's Taupo Volcano (about 26,500 years ago) was the world's most recent super eruption at a VEI-8 eruption.\n\nThe origin of the term \"supervolcano\" is linked to an early 20th-century scientific debate about the geological history and features of the Three Sisters volcanic region of Oregon in the United States. In 1925, Edwin T. Hodge suggested that a very large volcano, which he named Mount Multnomah, had existed in that region. He believed that several peaks in the Three Sisters area are the remnants of Mount Multnomah after it had been largely destroyed by violent volcanic explosions, similar to Mount Mazama. In 1948, the possible existence of Mount Multnomah was ignored by volcanologist Howel Williams in his book \"The Ancient Volcanoes of Oregon\". The book was reviewed in 1949 by another volcanologist, F. M. Byers Jr. In the review, Byers refers to Mount Multnomah as a supervolcano. It has since been proven that each peak of the Three Sisters was formed independently, and that Mount Multnomah did not exist. \n\nOver fifty years after Williams' book was published, the term \"supervolcano\" was popularised by the BBC popular science television program \"Horizon\" in 2000, to refer to eruptions that produce extremely large amounts of ejecta.\n\nThe term \"megacaldera\" is sometimes used for caldera supervolcanoes, such as the Blake River Megacaldera Complex in the Abitibi greenstone belt of Ontario and Quebec, Canada. Eruptions that rate VEI 8 are termed \"super eruptions\". Though there is no well-defined minimum explosive size for a \"supervolcano\", there are at least two types of volcanic eruptions that have been identified as supervolcanoes: large igneous provinces and massive eruptions.\n\nLarge igneous provinces, such as Iceland, the Siberian Traps, Deccan Traps, and the Ontong Java Plateau, are extensive regions of basalts on a continental scale resulting from flood basalt eruptions. When created, these regions often occupy several thousand square kilometres and have volumes on the order of millions of cubic kilometers. In most cases, the lavas are normally laid down over several million years. They release large amounts of gases.\n\nThe Réunion hotspot produced the Deccan Traps about 66 million years ago, coincident with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The scientific consensus is that a meteor impact was the cause of the extinction event, but the volcanic activity may have caused environmental stresses on extant species up to the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Additionally, the largest flood basalt event (the Siberian Traps) occurred around 250 million years ago and was coincident with the largest mass extinction in history, the Permian–Triassic extinction event, although it is unknown whether it was solely responsible for the extinction event.\n\nSuch outpourings are not explosive, though lava fountains may occur. Many volcanologists consider that Iceland may be a large igneous province that is currently being formed. The last major outpouring occurred in 1783–84 from the Laki fissure which is approximately long. An estimated of basaltic lava was poured out during the eruption.\n\nThe Ontong Java Plateau has an area of about , and the province was at least 50% larger before the Manihiki and Hikurangi Plateaus broke away.\n\nVolcanic eruptions are classified using the Volcanic Explosivity Index, or VEI. It is a logarithmic scale, which means that an increase of one in VEI number is equivalent to a tenfold increase in volume of erupted material. VEI 7 or VEI 8 eruptions are so powerful that they often form circular calderas rather than cones because the downward withdrawal of magma causes the overlying rock mass to collapse into the empty magma chamber beneath it.\n\nBased on incomplete statistics, at least 60 VEI 8 eruptions have been identified.\n\nVEI 7 eruptions, less colossal but still massive, have occurred in historical times. The only ones in the past 2,000 years are Taupo Volcano's Hatepe eruption c. 232, Baekdu Mountain in 946–947, the eruption of Mount Samalas in 1257, and Tambora in 1815. \n<nowiki>*</nowiki> means DRE (dense rock equivalent).\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6101870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6101870", "title": "Vaalbara", "text": "Vaalbara\n\nVaalbara was an Archean supercontinent consisting of the Kaapvaal Craton (now located in eastern South Africa) and the Pilbara Craton (now found in north-western Western Australia). E.S. Cheney derived the name from the last four letters of each craton's name. The two cratons consist of crust dating from 2.7 to 3.6 Gya, which would make Vaalbara Earth's earliest supercontinent.\n\nThere has been some debate as to when and if Vaalbara even existed.\n\nAn Archaean-Palaeoproterozoic (2.82.1 Ga) link between South Africa and Western Australia was first proposed by . He found a wide range of similarities between the Transvaal Basin in South Africa and the Hamersley Basin in Australia. Button, however, placed Madagascar between Africa and Australia and concluded that Gondwana must have had a long stable tectonic history. Similarly, in the reconstruction of Rogers 1993, 1996 the oldest continent is Ur. In Rogers' reconstructions, however, Kaapvaal and Pilbara are placed far apart already in their Gondwana configuration, a reconstruction contradicted by later orogenic events and incompatible with the Vaalbara hypothesis.\n\n, nevertheless, found a three-fold stratigraphic similarity and proposed that the two cratons once formed a continent which he named Vaalbara. This model is supported by the palaeomagnetic data of .\nReconstructions of the palaeolatitudes of the two cratons at 2.78–2.77 Ga are ambiguous however. In the reconstruction of they fail to overlap, but they do in more recent reconstructions, for example .\n\nOther scientists dispute the existence of Vaalbara and explain similarities between the two cratons as the product of global processes. They point to, for example, thick volcanic deposits on other cratons such as Amazonia, São Francisco, and Karnataka.\n\nZimgarn, another proposed supercraton composed of the Zimbabwe and Yilgarn cratons at 2.41 Ga, is distinct from Vaalbara. Zimgarn should have disintegrated around 2.1–2.0 Ga to reassemble as the Kalahari and West Australian (Yilgarn and Pilbara) cratons around 1.95–1.8 Ga.\n\nThe Archaean-Palaeoproterozoic Grunehogna Craton in Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica, formed the eastern part of the Kalahari Craton for at least a billion years. Grunehogna collided with the rest of East Antarctica during the Mesoproterozoic assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia and the Grenville orogeny. The Neoproterozoic Pan-African orogeny and the assembly of Gondwana/Pannotia produced large shear zones between Grunehogna and Kalahari. During the Jurassic break-up of Gondwana these shear zones finally separated Grunehogna and the rest of Antarctica from Africa.\nIn the Annandags Peaks, the only exposed parts of Grunehogna, detrital zircons from several crustal sources have been dated to 3.9–3.0 Ga suggesting intracrustal recycling was an important part in the formation of the first cratons.\n\nThe Kaapvaal craton is marked by dramatic events such as the intrusion of the Bushveld Complex (2.045 Ga) and the Vredefort impact event (2.025 Ga), and no traces of these events have been found in the Pilbara craton, clearly indicating that the two cratons were separated before 2.05 Ga. Furthermore, geochronological and palaeomagnetic evidence show that the two cratons had a rotational 30° latitudinal separation in the time period of 2.78–2.77 Ga, which indicates they were no longer joined after c. 2.8 billion years ago.\n\nVaalbara thus remained stable for 1–0.4 Ga and hence had a life span similar to that of later supercontinents such as Gondwana and Rodinia.\nSome palaeomagnetic reconstructions suggest a Palaeoarchaean Proto-Vaalbara is possible, although the existence of this 3.6–3.2 Ga continent can't be unequivocally proven.\n\nSouth Africa's Kaapvaal craton and Western Australia's Pilbara craton have similar early Precambrian cover sequences. Kaapvaal's Barberton granite-greenstone terrane and Pilbara's eastern block show evidence of four large meteorite impacts between 3.2 and 3.5 billion years ago. (Similar greenstone belts are now found at the margins of the Superior craton of Canada.)\n\nThe high temperatures created by the impact’s force fused sediments into small glassy spherules. Spherules of 3.5 billion years old exist in South Africa and spherules of a similar age have been found in Western Australia, they are the oldest-known terrestrial impact products. The spherules resemble the glassy chondrules (rounded granules) in carbonaceous chondrites, which are found in carbon-rich meteorites and lunar soils.\n\nRemarkably similar lithostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic structural sequences between these two cratons have been noted for the period between 3.5 and 2.7 billion years ago. Paleomagnetic data from two ultramafic complexes in the cratons showed that at the two cratons could have been part of the same supercontinent. Both the Pilbara and Kaapvaal cratons show extensional faults which were active about during felsic volcanism and coeval with the impact layers.\n\nThe Pilbara and Kaapvaal cratons are some of the oldest rocks in the world and they contain well-preserved Archaean microfossils. A series of international drilling projects has revealed traces of microbial life and photosynthesis from the Archaean in both Africa and Australia.\nThe oldest widely accepted evidence of photosynthesis by early life forms is molecular fossils found in 2.7 Ga-old shales in the Pilbara Craton. These fossils have been interpreted as traces of eukaryotes and cyanobacteria, though some scientists argue that these biomarkers must have entered these rocks later and date the fossils to 2.15–1.68 Ga.\nThis later time span agrees with estimates based on molecular clocks which dates the eukaryote last common ancestor at 1866–1679 Ma. If the Pilbara fossils are traces of early eukaryotes, they could represent groups that went extinct before modern groups emerged.\n\n\n"}
