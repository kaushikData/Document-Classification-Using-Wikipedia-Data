Panchami is the fifth day of \"Shukla Paksha\", the fortnight of the waxing moon in the Hindu month of Magh, (January - February). Vasanta Panchami, which marks the end of the winter and heralds in spring, is dedicated to goddess Saraswati. She is a goddess of water and of a river bearing her name. Her water originates in the Himalayas, flows southeast and meets the Ganges at Prayag near its confluence with the Yamuna (Triveni). Saraswati is also a goddess of speech and learning who blesses the world with \"vach\" (words), hymns, Sanskrit and the wealth of knowledge. It is auspicious for children to begin school and learn their first word on this day. In the ancient Indian texts, the \"Vedas\", the prayer for Sarasvati depicts her as a pristine lady in a white dress embellished with white flowers and white pearls. She sits on a white lotus blooming in a wide stretch of water (\"neluhini\"). She holds a \"veena\", a string instrument similar to a sitar. No animal is sacrifices and Indians have a vegetarian meal. Saraswati's prayer concludes,\n\nIn India, Vasanta is not a national holiday. However, it is celebrated in North and Eastern India. Students participate in the decoration and preparation of their place of worship. A few weeks before the celebration, schools become active in organizing various annual competitions of music, debate, sports and other activities. Prizes are distributed on the day of Vasanta Panchami. Many schools organize cultural activities in the evening of the Saraswati Puja day when parents and other community members attend the functions to encourage the children.\n\nOn Vasanta Pachami day, everyone rises early to bathe, dress in yellow clothes, adorn their forehead with the yellow of turmeric (\"tilak\"), and worship the sun goddess, Mother Ganga, and the earth. Books, articles, musical instruments, tools for art such as earthen inkpots and bamboo quills, are placed in front of the goddess to receive her blessings. The ink is made from unboiled milk water, red colour powder and silver glitter called \"avro\". Although it is auspicious for children to learn their first word on this day of celebration, everyone abstains from their usual reading and writing in deference to the goddess.\n\nThe colour yellow represents good fortune, spirituality, the ripening of the spring crops and the recent harvest. Food is coloured with saffron. The goddess Saraswati is dressed in yellow. In some traditional homes, sweetmeats of yellowish hues, such as kesar halva are offered to relatives and friends. Yellow flowers are used in abundance to decorate the places of worship. The yellow flowers of the mustard crop covers the field in such a way that it seems as if gold is spread over the land, glittering in the rays of the sun.\n\nThe Sufis introduced the festival to the Muslim community in India. By the Mughal period, Basant was a popular festival at major Sufi shrines. There are, for example, historical records of Nizam Auliya ki Basant, Khwaja Bakhtiar Kaki ki Basant, Khusrau ki Basant; festivals arranged around the shrines of these various Sufi saints. Amir Khusro (1253-1325) and Nizamuddin Auliya celebrated the festival with songs that used the word \"basant\" (festival). Khusrau, a Sufi-poet of the thirteenth century, composed verses about Vasanta:\n\nAaj basant manaalay, suhaagan,\nAaj basant manaalay\nAnjan manjan kar piya mori, lambay neher lagaalay\nTu kya sovay neend ki maasi,\nSo jaagay teray bhaag, suhaagun,\nAaj basant manaalay.\nOonchi naar kay oonchay chitvan,\nAyso diyo hai banaaye\nShah Amir tuhay dekhan ko,\nnainon say naina milaaye,\nSuhaagun, aaj basant manaalay.\n\nCelebrate basant today,\nO bride, Celebrate Basant today\nApply kajal to your eyes, and decorate your long hair\nOh why are you the servant of sleep?\nEven your fate is wide awake,\nCelebrate Basant today,\nO high lady with high looks,\nThat is how you were made,\nWhen the king looks at you, your eyes meet his eyes,\nO Bride, Celebrate Basant today.\"\nThe first day of Spring of Bengali month Falgun, of the Bengali calendar, celebrated in Bangladesh and West Bengal with processions, fairs and family time. In Bengali, Pahela stands for 'first' and 'Falgun' is eleventh month of the Bengali calendar. This day is marked with colourful celebration and traditionally, women wear yellow saris to celebrate this day. This celebration is also as \"Basanta Utsab\" (; \"Spring Festival\").\n\nBasant celebrations in Pakistan are limited. Instead, the \"Jashn-e-baharaan\" (Urdu) spring festival is celebrated for one month. However, Basant does continue in Lahore, Punjab.\n\nVarious fairs are held throughout the region. One such fair was started by Kalu Ram dedicated to the memory of Haqiqat Rai. Maharaja Ranjit Singh held many fairs and introduced kite flying to such fairs which he also held at Sufi shrines.\n\nControversy about the celebration of Basant in Pakistan is due to its Hindu origin in a now Islamic republic, and due to concerns about its safety. Safety concerns include the use of metal or glass coated kite strings (a slurry of fine glass shards which allowed one flyer to cut another's kite loose), power breakdowns due to damage from kites, overcrowding and the use of firearms. In small villages, disadvantaged children were trying to pull down kites. In 2005, kite flying was banned in Pakistan. In 2009, nine people in Pakistan died in kite flying related incidents.\n\nIn the Punjab region, the Vasanta Pachami is known as the \"Basant Panchami\". In the towns and villages of North India, Vasanta Pachami is celebrated as the secular Basant Festival of kites by all communities as a seasonal festival. Fields of mustard present a colourful sight all over rural Punjab. The phrase \"Ayi Basant Pala Udant\", meaning, \"with the onset of spring, winter bids adieu\" is used.\n\nMoving\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6532888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6532888", "title": "Bog butter", "text": "Bog butter\n\n\"Bog butter\" refers to an ancient waxy substance found buried in peat bogs, particularly in Ireland and Great Britain. Likely an old method of making and preserving butter, some tested lumps of bog butter were made of dairy products while others were meat-based.\n\nBog butter is found buried inside some sort of wooden container, such as buckets, kegs, barrels, dishes and butter churns. It is of animal origin, and is also known as butyrellite. Until 2003 scientists and archaeologists were not quite sure of the origin of bog butter. Scientists working at the University of Bristol discovered that some samples of the \"butter\" were of adipose/tallow origin while others were of dairy origin.\n\nIn Ireland, the practice of burying bog butter dates back to the first century AD, with bog butter found in Co Meath. On 28 April 2011, there were press reports of a find of approximately of bog butter in Tullamore, County Offaly. Found in a carved wooden vessel in diameter and in height, it was buried at a depth of , and still bore a faint smell of dairy.In Scotland, the practice of burying bog butter only dates back to the 2nd or 3rd century AD.\n\nBog butter was produced by interring butter or other fats within a peat bog after encasement within a wooden container, although augmentation of the latter with a deerskin bladder or layers of plant fibres was not unusual. The containers tend to be well-sealed with a convex surface, perhaps to prevent water from pooling and stagnating in direct contact with the packaging and/or contents.\n\nThe original motivations behind the creation of bog butter are unclear. One widespread theory is that food products were buried in bogs to hinder spoilage. Peat bogs, being low temperature, low oxygen, highly acidic environments, have excellent preservative properties. Experiments conducted by researcher Daniel C. Fisher demonstrated that pathogen and bacterial counts of meat buried in peat bogs for up to two years were comparable to levels found in control samples stored in a modern freezer, suggesting that this could be an effective preservation method.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis is \"primitive food processing\": it is possible that \"chemical reactions in the soil helped to transform the foods to more palatable products than could be made fresh\"—especially given the absence of salt in bog butters—or increase available nutrient content. In traditional cuisines, burial is a fairly common step in the preparation of highly perishable foods such as meat and dairy products; examples include century eggs (China), gravad lax (Scandinavia), hákarl (Iceland), the Inuit dishes igunaq and kiviaq, and Moroccan smen. Modern experiments in creating bog butter yield a product that seems to be an acquired taste, with \"flavor notes which were described primarily as ‘animal’ or ‘gamey’, ‘moss’, ‘funky’, ‘pungent’, and ‘salami’. These characteristics are certainly a far cry from the creamy acidity of a freshly made cultured butter, but has been found useful in the kitchen especially with strong and pungent dishes, in a similar manner to aged ghee\"\nThe practice of burying butter and other fats could also have arisen as a strategy for protecting vital provisions from thieves and/or invaders. For instance, in early medieval Ireland, there is no doubt that butter was a luxury food, with legal texts carefully delineating the quantity of butter which members of each socio-economic class were entitled to consume. Yet butter also had numerous, widespread non-culinary uses such as the payment of taxes, rents, and fines; facilitation of hospitality; care of the sick and infirm; and strengthening of social bonds. On occasion, butter might also have less prestigious applications, including waterproofing, and making candles or even cement. The frequency with which famines and animal epidemics struck would have necessitated development of storage techniques to protect this important product. It is possible many stashes were never retrieved due to enemy occupation or simple forgetfulness.\n\nA version of bog butter, Smen is still produced in North Africa – it is butter processed with thyme to start an enzyme process, then wrapped in herbs, encased in wood and stored in bogs. It is considered a gourmet food comparable to fine cheese. \n\n\n"}

They are sometimes also referred to as constrained or inaccessible RNA molecules. BNA monomers can contain a five-membered, six-membered or even a seven-membered bridged structure with a “fixed” C’-endo sugar puckering. The bridge is synthetically incorporated at the 2’, 4’-position of the ribose to afford a 2’, 4’-BNA monomer. The monomers can be incorporated into oligonucleotide polymeric structures using standard phosphoamidite chemistry. BNAs are structurally rigid oligo-nucleotides with increased binding affinities and stability.\n\nChemical structures of BNA monomers containing a bridge at the 2’, 4’-position of the ribose to afford a 2’, 4’-BNA monomer as synthesized by Takeshi Imanishi’s group. The nature of the bridge can vary for different types of monomers. The 3D structures for A-RNA and B-DNA were used as a template for the design of the BNA monomers. The goal for the design was to find derivatives that possess high binding affinities with complementary RNA and/or DNA strands.\n\nThe presence of 2’-hydroxyls in the RNA backbone favors a structure that resembles the A-form structure of DNA. The flexible five-membered furanose ring in nucleotides exists in equilibrium of two preferred conformations of the N- (C’-endo, A-form) and the S-type (C’-endo, B-form) as illustrated in the next figure.\n\nAn increased conformational inflexibility of the sugar moiety in nucleosides (oligonucleotides) results in a gain of high binding affinity with complementary single-stranded RNA and/or double-stranded DNA. The first 2’,4’-BNA (LNA) monomers were first synthesized by Takeshi Imanishi’s group in 1997 followed independently by Jesper Wengel’s group in 1998.\nChemical structures of other BNAs that were synthesized in the past years as indicated below the structures.\n\nBNA nucleotides can be incorporated into DNA or RNA oligonucleotides at any desired position. Such oligomers are synthesized chemically and are now commercially available. The bridged ribose conformation enhances base stacking and pre-organizes the backbone of the oligonucleotide significantly increasing their hybridization properties. \nThe incorporation of BNAs into oligonucleotides allows the production of modified synthetic oligonucleotides with:\n\n\nChemical structures of BNAs were introduced in 2007 by Imanishi’s group. These new generation of BNAs analogues are called 2’,4’-BNA[NH], 2’,4’-BNA[NMe], and 2’,4’-BNA[NBn].\n\nNew BNA analogs introduced by Imanishi’s group were designed by taking the length of the bridged moiety into account. A six-membered bridged structure with a unique structural feature (N-O bond) in the sugar moiety was designed to have a nitrogen atom. This atom improves the formation of duplexes and triplexes by lowering the repulsion between the negatively charged backbone phosphates. These modifications allow to control the affinity towards complementary strands, regulate resistance against nuclease degradation and the synthesis of functional molecules designed for specific applications in genomics. The properties of these analogs were investigated and compared to those of previous 2’,4’-BNA (LNA) modified oligonucleotides by Imanishi’s group. Imanishi’s results show that “2’,4’-BNA-modified oligonucleotides with these profiles show great promise for applications in antisense and antigene technologies.”\n\nMakoto Koizumi in 2004 reviewed the properties of BNAs with focus on ENAs as antisense and antigen oligonucleotides (AONs) and proposed an action mechanism for these compounds that may involve translation arrest, mRNA degradation mediated by RNase H and splicing arrest. This is illustrated in the following figure.\n\nYamamoto et al. in 2012 demonstrated that BNA-based antisense therapeutics inhibited hepatic PCSK9 expression, resulting in a strong reduction of the serum LDL-C levels of mice. The findings supported the hypothesis that PCSK9 is a potential therapeutic target for hypercholesterolemia and the researchers were able to show that BNA-based antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) induced cholesterol-lowering action in hypercholesterolemic mice. A moderate increase of aspartate aminotransferase, ALT, and blood urea nitrogen levels was observed whereas the histopathological analysis revealed no severe hepatic toxicities. The same group, also in 2012, reported that the 2’,4’-BNA[NMe] analog when used in antisense oligonucleotides showed significantly stronger inhibitory activities which is more pronounced in shorter (13- to 16mer) oligonucleotides. Their data led the researchers to conclude that the 2’,4’-BNA[NMe] analog may be a better alternative to conventional LNAs.\n\nSome of the benefits of BNAs include:\n\nApplication of BNAs include:\n\n"}

It is referred to in the Philippines as Coconut Lumber, or Coco Lumber, and elsewhere additionally as Cocowood. It is a new timber resource that comes from plantation crops and offers an alternative to rainforest timber.\n\nCoconut timber comes from farmed plantations of old coconut palms. The coconut palm was planted as a crop in large plantations throughout the tropics in the early half of the 20th century in order to harvest the coconut fruit. The tree bears fruit until approximately 70 years of age, at which point it is considered to have reached the end of its economic life and is felled to make way for future crops. Each year, several million palms are felled throughout the tropics. Traditionally, the trunks have been wasted by-products from this process.\n\nOnly in very recent years have people begun to explore the potential commercial uses for this vast, alternative supply of timber. This led to the commercial launch of coconut timber in a range of different products, from flooring to posts to furniture. With these products performing at equal to or even better than conventional hardwoods, coconut timber represents a viable substitute for endangered hardwoods from an ecologically-sound source.\n\nIts wood is reminiscent in appearance to mahogany; however, coconut timber has a much more fibrous grain than mahogany and lacks mahogany's iridescence. Colour tones and hues range from golden to near ebony, with dark brown flecks. There are three basic colour divisions relating to the timber's density: dark brown tones (high density); medium brown tones (medium density); and light golden tones (low density).\n\nCoconut trees have no annual growth rings, rays, heartwood or branches, meaning that coconut timber is free from knots and other such imperfections.\n\nThe coconut palm is a monocotyledon. It has a smooth, slender stem that grows to a height of about 25 metres and with an average diameter of 300 mm. The hardest, densest part of the wood is found on the outer perimeter of the trunk, which gives the tree its strength, while the wood’s high silica content gives the tree elasticity. Towards the centre of the trunk, the wood gets less hard. The wood has a Janka ball hardness of 112,5 - 154,7 kgf/cm (1600 – 2200 psi), which is greater than that of oak (70,3 - 84,4 kgf/cm) and Douglas-fir (35,9 kgf/cm).\n\nCoconut timber is classified according to three degrees of density:\n\nCoconut timber has many applications as both a structural and interior design material. The harder, high-density timber is suitable for general structural purposes such as pillars, trusses, rafting, furniture, window and door frames, floors, decking and floor joists. Medium density coconut timber can be used for walls, ceiling joists and horizontal studs. Low density coconut timber is used in non-load bearing applications like wood panelling, internal trim and ceilings, as well as homewares.\nCoconut timber supplied by Pacific Green is to be used in exterior applications throughout Abu Dhabi's Masdar City development, including the entrance gates, screens and doors.\n\nCoconut timber is a source of income for less developed South Pacific island communities. The previously low value senile coconut trunks have been promoted as a source of veneer and other wood products.\n\n\n"}

It is the only known member of the genus \"Mesonychoteuthis\". It is known from only a few specimens, and current estimates put its maximum size at long and weighing possibly up to , based on analysis of smaller and immature specimens, making it the largest-known invertebrate.\n\nUnlike the giant squid, whose arms and tentacles have only suckers lined with small teeth, the colossal squid's limbs are also equipped with sharp hooks: some swivelling, others three-pointed. Its body is wider and stouter, and therefore heavier, than that of the giant squid. Colossal squid are believed to have longer mantles than the giant squid, but shorter tentacles.\n\nThe squid exhibits abyssal gigantism. The beak of \"M. hamiltoni\" is the largest known of any squid, and more robust than that of the giant squid. The colossal squid also has the largest eyes documented in the animal kingdom; a partly collapsed specimen measured in diameter, with a pupil. The eye was estimated to be when the squid was alive.\n\nThe squid's known range extends thousands of kilometres north of Antarctica to southern South America, southern South Africa, and the southern tip of New Zealand, making it primarily an inhabitant of the entire circumantarctic Southern Ocean.\n\nLittle is known about the life of this creature, but it is believed to feed on prey such as chaetognatha, large fish such as the Patagonian toothfish, and smaller squid in the deep ocean using bioluminescence. A recent study by Remeslo, Yakushev and Laptikhovsky revealed that Antarctic toothfish make up a significant part of the colossal squid's diet; of the 8,000 toothfish brought aboard trawlers between 2011 and 2014, seventy-one showed clear signs of attack by colossal squid. The colossal squid is thought to have a very slow metabolic rate, needing only around of prey daily for an adult with a mass of . Estimates of its energy requirements suggest it is a slow-moving ambush predator, using its large eyes primarily for prey-detection rather than engaging in active hunting.\n\nBased on capture depths of a few specimens, and beaks found in sperm whale stomachs, the adult colossal squid ranges at least to a depth of , and juveniles can go as deep as . It is believed to be sexually dimorphic, with mature females generally being much larger than mature males, as is common in many species of invertebrates.\n\nThe squid's method of reproduction has not been observed, although some data on their reproduction can be inferred from anatomy. Since males lack an organ called a hectocotylus (an arm used in other cephalopods to transfer a spermatophore to the female), they probably use a penis instead, which would be used to directly implant sperm into females.\n\nMany sperm whales have scars on their backs, believed to be caused by the hooks of colossal squid. Colossal squid are a major prey item for sperm whales in the Antarctic; 14% of the squid beaks found in the stomachs of these sperm whales are those of the colossal squid, which indicates that colossal squid make up 77% of the biomass consumed by these whales. Many other animals also feed on colossal squid, including beaked whales (such as the southern bottlenose whale), pilot whales, southern elephant seals, Patagonian toothfish, sleeper sharks (\"Somniosus antarcticus\"), and albatrosses (e.g., the wandering and sooty albatrosses). However, beaks from mature adults have only been recovered from large predators (i.e. sperm whales and sleeper sharks), while the other predators only eat juveniles or young adults.\n\nThe species was first discovered in the form of two tentacles found in the stomach of a sperm whale in 1925. In 1981, a Russian trawler in the Ross Sea, off the coast of Antarctica, caught a large squid with a total length of over , which was later identified as an immature female of \"M. hamiltoni\". In 2003 a complete specimen of a subadult female was found near the surface with a total length of and a mantle length of . This specimen shows that colossal squids may grow larger than , possibly up to .\n\nIn 2005 a specimen was captured at a depth of while taking a toothfish from a longline off South Georgia Island. Although the mantle was not brought aboard, the mantle length was estimated at over , and the tentacles measured . The animal is thought to have weighed between .\n\nThe largest recorded specimen was captured in 2007 by a New Zealand fishing boat off Antarctica. It was initially estimated to measure in length and weigh . The squid was taken back to New Zealand for scientific study. A study on the specimen later showed its actual weight was , but it only measured in total length as a result of the tentacles' shrinking \"post mortem\".\n\nOn February 22, 2007, authorities in New Zealand announced the largest known colossal squid had been captured. The specimen weighed and was initially estimated to measure in total length. Fishermen on the vessel \"San Aspiring\", owned by the Sanford Seafood Company, caught the animal in the freezing Antarctic waters of the Ross Sea. It was brought to the surface as it fed on an Antarctic toothfish that had been caught off a long line. It would not let go of its prey and could not be removed from the line by the fishermen, so they decided to catch it instead. They managed to envelop it in a net, haul it aboard, and freeze it. The specimen eclipsed the previous largest find in 2003 by about , although it is still considerably smaller than some estimates for this species have predicted. The specimen was frozen in a cubic metre of water and transported to the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, New Zealand's national museum. Media reports suggested scientists at the museum were considering using a giant microwave to defrost the squid because thawing it at room temperature would take several days and it would likely begin to decompose on the outside while the core remained frozen. However, they later opted for the more conventional approach of thawing the specimen in a bath of salt water. After thawing, the squid measured only in total length, with the tentacles having shrunk significantly. Although initially thought to be a male, closer inspection of the specimen showed it to be a female.\n\nThawing and dissection of the specimen took place at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa under the direction of senior biologist Chris Paulin, with technician Mark Fenwick, Dutch marine biologist and toxicologist Olaf Blaauw, AUT biologist Steve O'Shea, Tsunemi Kubodera, and AUT biologist Kat Bolstad.\n\nParts of the specimen have been examined:\n\nThe Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa began displaying this specimen in an exhibition that opened on December 13, 2008; however the exhibition was closed in 2018 and slated to return in 2019.\n\nIn August 2014, Te Papa received a second colossal squid, captured in early 2014. The specimen was also female, was long and weighed approximately .\n\n\n\n"}

This name has been given to several factors before it was clear if they were the same or different effectors. More recently DIFs have garnered interest with their potential tumor inhibiting properties. DIFs have also been used to help regulate plant growth.\n\n\"Dictyostelium discoideum\" has been used since the 1940s to study cellular and developmental biology. It is well-suited for this research because it only develops two types of cells (stalk and spore) during morphogenesis. Each cell type has a distinct physical origin within the organism; pre-stalk cells coming from the anterior side and pre-spore cells from the posterior. Early evidence showed the differentiation of dense patches of pre-stalk cells were induced by cyclic AMP (cAMP) along with \"a factor\" that was likely low in molecular weight and able to diffuse across membranes. The structures for DIF-1, DIF-2, and DIF-3 were identified as these factors for stalk differentiation and subsequently synthesized to further research into implications for developmental biology. DIFs 1-3 are chlorinated hexaphenones (phenylalkan-1-ones, with chloro, hydroxy and methoxy substitution on the benzene ring), and have been isolated from \"Dictyostelium discoideum\" slime mold.\n\nSome research has shown that they have a role in controlling chemotaxis of \"Dictyostelium discoideum\", too. DIF-1 and DIF-3 are related in structure and function. DIF-3 is formed from the first step in the breakdown of DIF-1. In this state DIF-3 only performs about 3.5% as much of the activity of its predecessor. DIF-2 is unrelated to DIFs -1 and -3, but it works 40% as well as DIF-1 does to induce differentiation in stalk cells. Despite this similarity in function during differentiation, DIFs -1 and -2 act very differently in chemotactic movement of the cells toward cAMP. DIF-1 has a slight inhibitory effect on movement of starved cells toward cAMP, while DIF-2 has a strong positive effect of movement of these cells toward cAMP. These effects are thought to be carried out through phosphodiesterase activations that impact cGMP production to impact chemotaxis. An increase in chemotaxis can be related to malignant migration of cancer cells.\n\nInvestigation into the anti-tumor properties of DIFs have followed one main line; the disruption of a pathway necessary for the cancer's uncontrolled growth reducing its proliferative ability. As mentioned above, the ability of DIF-1 to decrease movement of proliferating cells toward sources of energy could serve as an anti-tumor property. In another example, DIF-1 has been shown to reduce the proliferation of gastric cancer cells via upregulation of the MEK-ERK-dependent pathway. Other studies have shown how complicated the anti-tumor interactions of DIFs may be, especially when considering the indirect impacts DIFs have on target molecules. For instance, DIF-like molecules have been shown to inhibit cell growth and bring about cell death through uncoupling in mitochondria.\n\nMore recent focus has been on the potential therapeutic effects DIF-like molecules. Derivatives of DIF-1 and DIF-3 have already been investigated with promising initial results. One group of derivatives yielded two DIF-1-like compounds that were effective in suppression of IL-2 production which could be helpful in controlling septic responses and other infections.\n\n"}

{"id": "29249120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29249120", "title": "Johnson thermoelectric energy converter", "text": "Johnson thermoelectric energy converter\n\nA Johnson thermoelectric energy converter or JTEC is a type of solid-state heat engine that uses the electrochemical oxidation and reduction of hydrogen in a two-cell, thermal cycle that approximates the Ericsson cycle. It is under investigation as a viable alternative to conventional photovoltaic cells. Lonnie Johnson invented it and claims the converter exhibits an energy conversion efficiency of as much as 60% compared to the 30% efficiency typical of the best photovoltaic cells; however, this claim is at a theoretical level based on comparison with a Carnot cycle and assumes a temperature gradient of 600C. It was originally proposed for funding to the Office of Naval Research but was refused. Johnson obtained later funding by framing the engine as a hydrogen fuel cell. Johnson is collaborating with PARC on development of the engine.\n\nThe JTEC converts heat into electrical energy by compressing and expanding hydrogen gas. It operates as a closed system with no moving classical mechanical parts, requires no input of fuel, and creates no exhaust. The engine consists of two stages: A low-temperature compression stage and a high-temperature power stage. Each stage consists of a working fluid chamber that a copper lined membrane electrode assembly (MEA) bisects. A MEA is a proprietary ceramic proton exchange membrane (PEM) that is sandwiched between two electrodes.\n\nIn the high-temperature power stage, expanding high pressure hydrogen from the compression stage converts the heat energy into electrical energy via the MEA. As the high-temperature, high pressure hydrogen is forced through the PEM it is ionized, producing protons and electrons. The protons pass through the membrane while the electrodes expel the electrons through a load. After passing through the PEM, the protons recombine with the electrons to produce low pressure hydrogen gas that flows out to the compression stage. From the perspective of the high-temperature stage, the load consists of the external load on the engine and the low-temperature compression stage. In the compression stage, electrical potential is applied across the MEA and forces protons to flow through the PEM to produce high pressure hydrogen. As the hydrogen travels between the stages, it passes through a heat exchanger that increases efficiency by helping to keep the high-temperature stage hot and the low-temperature stage cool.\n\nThe amount of energy available to the external load is the difference in electrical potential between that needed to compress hydrogen at low-temperature and that which expanding it at high-temperature generates. Unlike other heat pump devices, the JTEC requires an initial input of electrical energy to start the compression stage and initiate the cycle. The engine can also be operated in reverse to convert electrical energy into a temperature differential, for example in HVAC applications. In the proposed application, solar irradiance would heat the power stage and the compression stage connect to an ambient temperature heat sink.\n\nThe scalability of the engine leads its developers to claim that its potential applications range from providing power for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to functioning as large-scale power plants.\n\nThe converter can use many diverse forms of fuel without the need for fuel-specific customization as seen in internal combustion engines and generate power from fuel combustion, solar irradiance, low grade waste heat from industry, or such other power generation systems as fuel cells, internal combustion engines, or turbines because it functions as an external combustion engine.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1821971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1821971", "title": "Mid-ocean ridge", "text": "Mid-ocean ridge\n\nA mid-ocean ridge (MOR) is an underwater mountain system formed by plate tectonics. It consists of various mountains linked in chains, typically having a valley known as a rift running along its spine. This type of oceanic mountain ridge is characteristic of what is known as an 'oceanic spreading center', which is responsible for seafloor spreading. The production of new seafloor results from mantle upwelling in response to plate spreading; this isentropic upwelling solid mantle material eventually exceeds the solidus and melts. The buoyant melt rises as magma at a linear weakness in the oceanic crust, and emerges as lava, creating new crust upon cooling. A mid-ocean ridge demarcates the boundary between two tectonic plates, and consequently is termed a divergent plate boundary.\n\nMid-ocean ridges are geologically active, with continuing volcanism and seismicity. New magma steadily emerges onto the ocean floor and intrudes into the ocean crust at and near rifts along the ridge axes. The crystallized magma forms new crust of basalt (known as MORB for mid-ocean ridge basalt) and below it (in the lower oceanic crust), gabbro. MORs are formed by two oceanic plates moving away from each other. Hydrothermal vents are a common feature at oceanic spreading centers.\n\nMid-ocean ridge basalt is a tholeiitic basalt and is characteristically low in incompatible elements.\n\nThe rocks making up the crust below the seafloor are youngest along the axis of the ridge and age with increasing distance from that axis. New magma of basalt composition emerges at and near the axis because of decompression melting in the underlying Earth's mantle.\n\nThe oceanic crust is made up of rocks much younger than the Earth itself. Most oceanic crust in the ocean basins is less than 200 million years old. The crust is in a constant state of \"renewal\" at the ocean ridges. Moving away from the mid-ocean ridge, ocean depth progressively increases; the greatest depths are in ocean trenches. As the oceanic crust moves away from the ridge axis, the peridotite in the underlying mantle cools and becomes more rigid. The crust and the relatively rigid peridotite below it make up the oceanic lithosphere.\n\nThe bathymetry, or profile of a MOR is largely determined by the seafloor spreading rate at the ridge. Slow spreading ridges (< 5 cm/yr) like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) generally have large, wide rift valleys, sometimes as wide as , and very rugged terrain at the ridge crest that can have relief of up to a . By contrast, fast spreading ridges (>8 cm/yr) like the East Pacific Rise (EPR) are narrow, sharp incisions surrounded by generally flat topography that slopes away from the ridge over many hundreds of miles. Ultra-slow spreading ridges (< 2 cm/yr), like the Southwest India and the Arctic Ridges form both magmatic and amagmatic ridge segments without transform faults.\n\nThe spreading center or axis, commonly connects to a transform fault oriented at right angles to the axis. The flanks of mid-ocean ridges are in many places marked by the inactive scars of transform faults called fracture zones. At faster spreading rates the axes often display Overlapping Spreading Centers that lack connecting transform faults.\n\nThe depth of the seafloor (or the height of a location on a mid-ocean ridge above a baselevel) is closely correlated with its age (age of the lithosphere where depth is measured). The age-depth relation can be modeled by the cooling of a lithosphere plate or mantle half-space in areas without significant subduction. The overall shape of ridges results from Pratt isostacy: close to the ridge axis there is hot, low-density mantle supporting the oceanic crust. As the oceanic plates cool, away from the ridge axes, the oceanic mantle lithosphere (the colder, denser part of the mantle that, together with the crust, comprises the oceanic plates) thickens and the density increases. Thus older seafloor is underlain by denser material and is deeper. The width of the ridge is hence a function of spreading rate – slow ridges like the MAR have spread much less far (showing a narrower profile) than faster ridges like the EPR (wider profile) for the same amount of cooling and consequent bathymetric deepening.\n\nTwo processes, ridge-push and slab pull, are thought to be responsible for the spreading seen at mid-ocean ridges, and there is some uncertainty as to which is dominant. Ridge-push occurs when the growing bulk of the ridge pushes the rest of the tectonic plate away from the ridge, often towards a subduction zone. At the subduction zone, \"slab-pull\" comes into effect. This is simply the weight of the tectonic plate being subducted (pulled) below the overlying plate dragging the rest of the plate along behind it. The slab pull mechanism is considered to be contributing more than the ridge push.\n\nThe other process proposed to contribute to the formation of new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges is the \"mantle conveyor\" (see image). However, there have been some studies which have shown that the upper mantle (asthenosphere) is too plastic (flexible) to generate enough friction to pull the tectonic plate along. Moreover, unlike in the image above, mantle upwelling that causes magma to form beneath the ocean ridges appears to involve only its upper , as deduced from seismic tomography and from studies of the seismic discontinuity at about . The relatively shallow depths from which the upwelling mantle rises below ridges are more consistent with the \"slab-pull\" process. On the other hand, some of the world's largest tectonic plates such as the North American Plate are in motion, yet are nowhere being subducted.\n\nThe rate at which the mid-ocean ridge creates new material is known as the spreading rate, and is typically measured in mm/yr. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 90 mm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 50–90 mm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 50 mm/year. The spreading rate of the North Atlantic Ocean is ~ 25 mm/yr, while in the Pacific region, it is 80–120 mm/yr. Ridges that spread at rates <20 mm/yr are referred to as ultraslow spreading ridges (e.g., the Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean and the Southwest Indian Ridge) and they provide a much different perspective on crustal formation than their faster spreading brethren.\n\nThe mid-ocean ridge systems form new oceanic crust. As crystallized basalt extruded at a ridge axis cools below Curie points of appropriate iron-titanium oxides, magnetic field directions parallel to the Earth's magnetic field are recorded in those oxides. The orientations of the field in the oceanic crust preserve a record of directions of the Earth's magnetic field with time. Because the field has reversed directions at irregular intervals throughout its history, the pattern of geomagnetic reversals in the ocean crust can be used as an indicator of age. Likewise, the pattern of reversals together with age measurements of the crust is used to help establish the history of the Earth's magnetic field.\n\nThe mid-ocean ridges of the world are connected and form \"the\" Ocean Ridge, a single global mid-oceanic ridge system that is part of every ocean, making it the longest mountain range in the world. The continuous mountain range is long (several times longer than the Andes, the longest continental mountain range), and the total length of the oceanic ridge system is long.\n\nIncreased rates of sea-floor spreading (i.e. the expansion of the mid-ocean ridge) has caused global (eustatic) sea-level to rise over very long timescales (millions of years).\n\nThe high sea levels that occurred during the Cretaceous period (144–65 Ma) can only be attributed to plate tectonics since thermal expansion and the absence of ice sheets by themselves cannot account for the fact that sea levels were 100–170 meters higher than today.\n\nIncreased sea-floor spreading means that the hot young crust at the mid-ocean ridge will form at a faster rate than it can be destroyed at subduction zones. The mid-ocean ridge will then expand and form a broader ridge, taking up more space in the ocean basin and causing sea levels to rise.\n\nSea-level change can be attributed to other factors (thermal expansion, ice melting). Over very long timescales, however, it is the result of changes in the volume of the ocean basins which are, in turn, affected by rates of sea-floor spreading along the mid-ocean ridges.\n\nMid-ocean ridges are global scale ion-exchange systems.\n\nRapid spreading rates will expand the mid-ocean ridge causing basalt reactions with seawater to happen faster. The magnesium/calcium ratio will be lower because more magnesium ions are being removed from seawater and consumed by the rock, and more calcium ions are being removed from the rock and released to seawater. A lower Mg/Ca ratio favors the precipitation of low-Mg calcite polymorphs of calcium carbonate (calcite seas).\n\nSlow spreading at mid-ocean ridges has the opposite effect and will result in a higher Mg/Ca ratio favoring the precipitation of aragonite and high-Mg calcite polymorphs of calcium carbonate (aragonite seas).\n\nExperiments show that most modern high-Mg calcite organisms would have been low-Mg calcite in past calcite seas, meaning that the Mg/Ca ratio in an organism's skeleton varies with the Mg/Ca ratio of the seawater in which it was grown.\n\nThe mineralogy of reef-building and sediment-producing organisms is thus regulated by chemical reactions occurring along the mid-ocean ridge, the rate of which is controlled by sea-floor spreading.\n\nMid-ocean ridges are generally submerged deep in the ocean. It was not until the 1950s, when the ocean floor was surveyed in detail, that their full extent became known.\n\nThe \"Vema\", a ship of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, traversed the Atlantic Ocean, recording data about the ocean floor from the ocean surface. A team led by Marie Tharp and Bruce Heezen analyzed the data and concluded that there was an enormous mountain chain running up the middle. Scientists named it the \"Mid-Atlantic Ridge\".\n\nAt first, the ridge was thought to be a phenomenon specific to the Atlantic Ocean. However, as surveys of the ocean floor continued around the world, it was discovered that every ocean contains parts of the mid-ocean ridge system. Although the ridge system runs down the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, the ridge is located away from the center of other oceans.\n\nAlfred Wegener proposed the theory of continental drift in 1912. He stated: \"the Mid-Atlantic Ridge ... zone in which the floor of the Atlantic, as it keeps spreading, is continuously tearing open and making space for fresh, relatively fluid and hot sima [rising] from depth\". However, Wegener did not pursue this observation in his later works and his theory was dismissed by geologists because there was no mechanism to explain how continents could plow through ocean crust, and the theory became largely forgotten.\n\nFollowing the discovery of the worldwide extent of the mid-ocean ridge in the 1950s, geologists faced a new task: explaining how such an enormous geological structure could have formed. In the 1960s, geologists discovered and began to propose mechanisms for seafloor spreading. The discovery of mid-ocean ridges and the process of seafloor spreading allowed for Wegner's theory to be expanded so that it included the movement of oceanic crust as well as the continents. Plate tectonics was a suitable explanation for seafloor spreading, and the acceptance of plate tectonics by the majority of geologists resulted in a major paradigm shift in geological thinking.\n\nIt is estimated that 20 volcanic eruptions occur each year along earth's mid-ocean ridges and that every year of new seafloor is formed by this process. With a crustal thickness of , this amounts to about of new ocean crust formed every year.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The majority of natural dyes are vegetable dyes from plant sources—roots, berries, bark, leaves, and wood—and other biological sources such as fungi and lichens.\n\nArchaeologists have found evidence of textile dyeing dating back to the Neolithic period. In India, dyeing with plants, barks and insects has been traced back more than 5,000 years. The essential process of dyeing changed little over time. Typically, the dye material is put in a pot of water and then the textiles to be dyed are added to the pot, which is heated and stirred until the color is transferred. Textile fibre may be dyed before spinning (\"dyed in the wool\"), but most textiles are \"yarn-dyed\" or \"piece-dyed\" after weaving. Many natural dyes require the use of chemicals called mordants to bind the dye to the textile fibres; tannin from oak galls, salt, natural alum, vinegar, and ammonia from stale urine were used by early dyers. Many mordants, and some dyes themselves, produce strong odors, and large-scale dyeworks were often isolated in their own districts.\n\nThroughout history, people have dyed their textiles using common, locally available materials, but scarce dyestuffs that produced brilliant and permanent colors such as the natural invertebrate dyes, Tyrian purple and crimson kermes, became highly prized luxury items in the ancient and medieval world. Plant-based dyes such as woad (\"Isatis tinctoria\"), indigo, saffron, and madder were raised commercially and were important trade goods in the economies of Asia and Europe. Across Asia and Africa, patterned fabrics were produced using resist dyeing techniques to control the absorption of color in piece-dyed cloth. Dyes such as cochineal and logwood (\"Haematoxylum campechianum\") were brought to Europe by the Spanish treasure fleets, and the dyestuffs of Europe were carried by colonists to America.\n\nThe discovery of man-made synthetic dyes in the mid-19th century triggered a long decline in the large-scale market for natural dyes. Synthetic dyes, which could be produced in large quantities, quickly superseded natural dyes for the commercial textile production enabled by the industrial revolution, and unlike natural dyes, were suitable for the synthetic fibres that followed. Artists of the \"Arts and Crafts Movement\" preferred the pure shades and subtle variability of natural dyes, which mellow with age but preserve their true colors, unlike early synthetic dyes, and helped ensure that the old European techniques for dyeing and printing with natural dyestuffs were preserved for use by home and craft dyers. Natural dyeing techniques are also preserved by artisans in traditional cultures around the world.\n\nIn the early 21st century, the market for natural dyes in the fashion industry is experiencing a resurgence. Western consumers have become more concerned about the health and environmental impact of synthetic dyes in manufacturing and there is a growing demand for products that use natural dyes. The European Union, for example, has encouraged Indonesian batik cloth producers to switch to natural dyes to improve their export market in Europe.\n\nFibre content determines the type of dye required for a fabric:\nCellulose fibres require fibre-reactive, direct/substantive, and vat dyes, which are colourless, soluble dyes fixed by light and/or oxygen. Protein fibres require vat, acid, or indirect/mordant dyes, that require a bonding agent. Each synthetic fibre requires its own dyeing method, for example, nylon requires acid, disperse and pigment dyes, rayon acetate requires disperse dyes, and so on. The types of natural dyes currently in use by the global fashion industry include:\n\n\n\nColors in the \"ruddy\" range of reds, browns, and oranges are the first attested colors in a number of ancient textile sites ranging from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age across the Levant, Egypt, Mesopotamia and Europe, followed by evidence of blues and then yellows, with green appearing somewhat later. The earliest surviving evidence of textile dyeing was found at the large Neolithic settlement at Çatalhöyük in southern Anatolia, where traces of red dyes, possible from ochre (iron oxide pigments from clay), were found. Polychrome or multicolored fabrics seem to have been developed in the 3rd or 2nd millennium BCE. Textiles with a \"red-brown warp and an ochre-yellow weft\" were discovered in Egyptian pyramids of the Sixth Dynasty (2345–2180 BCE).\n\nThe chemical analysis that would definitively identify the dyes used in ancient textiles has rarely been conducted, and even when a dye such as indigo blue is detected it is impossible to determine which of several indigo-bearing plants was used. Nevertheless, based on the colors of surviving textile fragments and the evidence of actual dyestuffs found in archaeological sites, reds, blues, and yellows from plant sources were in common use by the late Bronze Age and Iron Age.\n\nIn the 18th century Jeremias Friedrich Gülich made substantial contributions to refining the dyeing process, making particular progress on setting standards on dyeing sheep wool and many other textiles. His contributions to refining the dying process and his theories on colour brought much praise by the well known poet and artist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\n\nThe essential process of dyeing requires soaking the material containing the dye (the \"dyestuff\") in water, adding the textile to be dyed to the resulting solution (the \"dyebath\"), and bringing the solution to a simmer for an extended period, often measured in days or even weeks, stirring occasionally until the color has evenly transferred to the textiles.\n\nSome dyestuffs, such as indigo and lichens, will give good color when used alone; these dyes are called \"direct dyes\" or \"substantive dyes\". The majority of plant dyes, however, also require the use of a mordant, a chemical used to \"fix\" the color in the textile fibres. These dyes are called \"adjective dyes\". By using different mordants, dyers can often obtain a variety of colors and shades from the same dye. Fibres or cloth may be pretreated with mordants, or the mordant may be incorporated in the dyebath. In traditional dyeing, the common mordants are vinegar, tannin from oak bark, sumac or oak galls, ammonia from stale urine, and wood-ash liquor or potash (potassium carbonate) made by leaching wood ashes and evaporating the solution.\n\nSalt helps to \"fix\" or increase \"fastness\" of colors, vinegar improves reds and purples, and the ammonia in stale urine assists in the fermentation of indigo dyes.\nNatural alum (aluminum sulfate) is the most common metallic salt mordant, but tin (stannous chloride), copper (cupric sulfate), iron (ferrous sulfate, called \"copperas\") and chrome (potassium dichromate) are also used. Iron mordants \"sadden\" colors, while tin and chrome mordants brighten colors. The iron mordants contribute to fabric deterioration, referred to as \"dye rot\". Additional chemicals or \"alterants\" may be applied after dying to further alter or reinforce the colors.\n\nTextiles may be dyed as raw fibre (\"dyed in the fleece\" or \"dyed in the wool\"), as spun yarn (\"dyed in the hank\" or \"yarn-dyed\"), or after weaving (\"piece-dyed\"). Mordants often leave residue in wool fibre that makes it difficult to spin, so wool was generally dyed after spinning, as yarn or woven cloth. Indigo, however, requires no mordant, and cloth manufacturers in medieval England often dyed wool in the fleece with the indigo-bearing plant woad and then dyed the cloth again after weaving to produce deep blues, browns, reds, purples, blacks, and tawnies.\n\nIn China, Japan, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Gambia, and other parts of West Africa and southeast Asia, patterned silk and cotton fabrics were produced using resist dyeing techniques in which the cloth is printed or stenciled with starch or wax, or tied in various ways to prevent even penetration of the dye when the cloth is piece-dyed. The Chinese \"ladao\" process is dated to the 10th century; other traditional techniques include tie-dye, batik, Rōketsuzome, katazome, bandhani and leheria.\n\nThe mordants used in dyeing and many dyestuffs themselves give off strong and unpleasant odors, and the actual process of dyeing requires a good supply of fresh water, storage areas for bulky plant materials, vats which can be kept heated (often for days or weeks) along with the necessary fuel, and airy spaces to dry the dyed textiles. Ancient large-scale dye-works tended to be located on the outskirts of populated areas, on windy promontories.\n\nA variety of plants produce red dyes, including avocado pits, a number of lichens, henna, alkanet or dyer's bugloss (\"Alkanna tinctoria\"), asafoetida and dyer's madder \"Rubia tinctorum\". Madder and related plants of the genus \"Rubia\" are native to many temperate zones around the world, and were already used as sources of good red dye, such as rose madder, in prehistory. Madder has been identified on linen in the tomb of Tutankhamun, and Pliny the Elder records madder growing near Rome. Madder was a dye of commercial importance in Europe, being cultivated in the Netherlands and France to dye the red coats of military uniforms until the market collapsed following the development of synthetic alizarin dye in 1869. Madder was also used to dye the \"hunting pinks\" of Great Britain.\n\nTurkey red was a strong, very fast red dye for cotton obtained from madder root via a complicated multistep process involving \"sumac and oak galls, calf's blood, sheep's dung, oil, soda, alum, and a solution of tin\". Turkey red was developed in India and spread to Turkey. Greek workers familiar with the methods of its production were brought to France in 1747, and Dutch and English spies soon discovered the secret. A sanitized version of Turkey red was being produced in Manchester by 1784, and roller-printed dress cottons with a Turkey red ground were fashionable in England by the 1820s.\n\nMunjeet or Indian madder (\"Rubia cordifolia\") is native to the Himalayas and other mountains of Asia and Japan. Munjeet was an important dye for the Asian cotton industry and is still used by craft dyers in Nepal.\n\nPuccoon or bloodroot (\"Sanguinaria canadensis\") is a popular red dye among Southeastern Native American basketweavers. Choctaw basketweavers additionally use sumac for red dye. Coushattas artists from Texas and Louisiana used the water oak (\"Quercus nigra\" L.) to produce red.\n\nA delicate rose color in Navajo rugs comes from fermented prickly pear cactus fruit, \"Opuntia polyacantha\". Navajo weavers also use rainwater and red dirt to create salmon-pink dyes.\n\nDyes that create reds and yellows can also yield oranges. Navajo dyers create orange dyes from one-seeded juniper, \"Juniperus monosperma\", Navajo tea, \"Thelesperma gracile\", or alder bark.\n\nYellow dyes are \"about as numerous as red ones\", and can be extracted from saffron, pomegranate rind, turmeric, safflower, onionskins, and a number of weedy flowering plants. Limited evidence suggests the use of weld (\"Reseda luteola\"), also called mignonette or dyer's rocket before the Iron Age, but it was an important dye of the ancient Mediterranean and Europe and is indigenous to England. Two brilliant yellow dyes of commercial importance in Europe from the 18th century are derived from trees of the Americas: quercitron from the inner bark of Eastern Black Oak (\"Quercus velutina\"), native to eastern North America and fustic from the dyer's mulberry tree (\"Maclura tinctoria\") of the West Indies and Mexico.\n\nIn rivercane basketweaving among Southeastern Woodlands tribes in the Americas, butternut (\"Juglans cinerea\") and yellow root (\"Xanthorhiza simplicissima\") provide a rich yellow color. Chitimacha basket weavers have a complex formula for yellow that employs a dock plant (most likely \"Rumex crispus\") for yellow. Navajo artists create yellow dyes from small snake-weed, brown onion skins, and rubber plant (\"Parthenium incanum\"). Rabbitbush (\"Chrysothamnus\") and rose hips produce pale, yellow-cream colored dyes.\n\nIf plants that yield yellow dyes are common, plants that yield green dyes are rare. Both woad and indigo have been used since ancient times in combination with yellow dyes to produce shades of green. Medieval and Early Modern England was especially known for its green dyes. The dyers of Lincoln, a great cloth town in the high Middle Ages, produced the Lincoln green cloth associated with Robin Hood by dyeing wool with woad and then overdyeing it yellow with weld or dyer's greenweed (\"Genista tinctoria\"), also known as dyer's broom. Woolen cloth mordanted with alum and dyed yellow with dyer's greenweed was overdyed with woad and, later, indigo, to produce the once-famous Kendal green. This in turn fell out of fashion in the 18th century in favor of the brighter Saxon green, dyed with indigo and fustic.\n\nSoft olive greens are also achieved when textiles dyed yellow are treated with an iron mordant. The dull green cloth common to the Iron Age Halstatt culture shows traces of iron, and was possibly colored by boiling yellow-dyed cloth in an iron pot. Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau in North America used lichen to dye corn husk bags a sea green.\n\nNavajo textile artist Nonabah Gorman Bryan developed a two-step process for creating green dye. First the Churro wool yarn is dyed yellow with sagebrush, \"Artemisia tridentata\", and then it is soaked in black dye afterbath. Red onion skins are also used by Navajo dyers to produce green.\n\nBlue colorants around the world were derived from indigo dye-bearing plants, primarily those in the genus \"Indigofera\", which are native to the tropics. The primary commercial indigo species in Asia was true indigo (\"Indigofera tinctoria\"). India is believed to be the oldest center of indigo dyeing in the Old World. It was a primary supplier of indigo dye to Europe as early as the Greco-Roman era. The association of India with indigo is reflected in the Greek word for the dye, which was \"indikon\" (ινδικόν). The Romans used the term \"indicum\", which passed into Italian dialect and eventually into English as the word \"indigo\".\n\nIn Central and South America, the important blue dyes were Añil (\"Indigofera suffruticosa\") and Natal indigo (\"Indigofera arrecta\").\n\nIn temperate climates including Europe, indigo was obtained primarily from woad (\"Isatis tinctoria\"), an indigenous plant of Assyria and the Levant which has been grown in Northern Europe over 2,000 years, although from the 18th century it was mostly replaced by superior Indian indigo imported by the British East India Company. Woad was carried to New England in the 17th century and used extensively in America until native stands of indigo were discovered in Florida and the Carolinas. In Sumatra, indigo dye is extracted from some species of \"Marsdenia\". Other indigo-bearing dye plants include dyer's knotweed (\"Polygonum tinctorum\") from Japan and the coasts of China, and the West African shrub \"Lonchocarpus cyanescens\".\n\nIn medieval Europe, purple, violet, murrey and similar colors were produced by dyeing wool with woad or indigo in the fleece and then piece-dyeing the woven cloth with red dyes, either the common madder or the luxury dyes kermes and cochineal. Madder could also produce purples when used with alum. Brazilwood also gave purple shades with vitriol (sulfuric acid) or potash.\n\nChoctaw artists traditionally used maple (\"Acer\" sp.) to create lavender and purple dyes. Purples can also be derived from lichens, and from the berries of White Bryony from the northern Rocky Mountain states and mulberry (\"morus nigra\") (with an acid mordant).\n\nCutch is an ancient brown dye from the wood of acacia trees, particularly \"Acacia catechu\", used in India for dyeing cotton. Cutch gives gray-browns with an iron mordant and olive-browns with copper.\n\nBlack walnut (\"Juglans nigra\") is used by Cherokee artists to produce a deep brown approaching black. Today black walnut is primarily used to dye baskets but has been used in the past for fabrics and deerhide. Juniper, \"Juniperus monosperma\", ashes provide brown and yellow dyes for Navajo people, as do the hulls of wild walnuts (\"Juglans major\"). Khaki, which translates a Hindustani word signifying \"soil-coloured\", was introduced into British uniforms in India, which were dyed locally with a dye prepared from the native mazari palm \"Nannorrhops\".\n\nChoctaw dyers use maple (\"Acer\" sp.) for a grey dye. Navajo weavers create black from mineral yellow ochre mixed with pitch from the piñon tree(\"Pinus edulis\") and the three-leaved sumac (\"Rhus trilobata\"). They also produce a cool grey dye with blue flower lupine and a warm grey from Juniper mistletoe (\"Phoradendron juniperinum\").\n\nDye-bearing lichen produce a wide range of greens, oranges, yellows, reds, browns, and bright pinks and purples. The lichen \"Rocella tinctoria\" was found along the Mediterranean Sea and was used by the ancient Phoenicians. In recent times, lichen dyes have been an important part of the dye traditions of Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and among native peoples of the southwest and Intermontane Plateaus of the United States. Scottish lichen dyes include cudbear (also called archil in England and litmus in the Netherlands), and crottle.\n\nThe American artist Miriam C. Rice pioneered research into using various mushrooms for natural dyes. Starting in the late 1960s, she discovered mushroom dyes for a complete rainbow palette. Swedish and American mycologists, building upon Rice's research, have discovered sources for true blues (\"Sarcodon squamosus\") and mossy greens (\"Hydnellum geogenium\"). \"Hypholoma fasciculare\" provides a yellow dye, and fungi such as \"Phaeolus schweinitzii\" and \"Pisolithus tinctorius\" are used in dyeing textiles and paper.\n\nFrom the second millennium BC to the 19th century, a succession of rare and expensive natural dyestuffs came in and out of fashion in the ancient world and then in Europe. In many cases the cost of these dyes far exceeded the cost of the wools and silks they colored, and often only the finest grades of fabrics were considered worthy of the best dyes.\n\nThe premier luxury dye of the ancient world was Tyrian purple or royal purple, a purple-red dye which is extracted from several genera of sea snails, primarily the spiny dye-murex \"Murex brandaris\" (currently known as \"Bolinus brandaris\"). Murex dye was greatly prized in antiquity because it did not fade, but instead became brighter and more intense with weathering and sunlight. Murex dyeing may have been developed first by the Minoans of East Crete or the West Semites along the Levantine coast, and heaps of crushed murex shells have been discovered at a number of locations along the eastern Mediterranean dated to the mid-2nd millennium BC. The classical dye known as Phoenician Red was also derived from murex snails.\n\nMurex dyes were fabulously expensive – one snail yields but a single drop of dye – and the Roman Empire imposed a strict monopoly on their use from the reign of Alexander Severus (AD 225–235) that was maintained by the succeeding Byzantine Empire until the Early Middle Ages. The dye was used for imperial manuscripts on purple parchment, often with text in silver or gold, and \"porphyrogenitos\" or \"born in the purple\" was a term for Byzantine offspring of a reigning Emperor. The color matched the increasingly rare purple rock porphyry, also associated with the imperial family.\n\nTyrian purple retained its place as the premium dye of Europe until it was replaced \"in status and desirability\" by the rich crimson reds and scarlets of the new silk-weaving centers of Italy, colored with kermes. Kermes is extracted from the dried unlaid eggs of the insect \"Kermes vermilio\" or \"Kermococcus vermilio\" found on species of oak (especially the Kermes oak of the Mediterranean region). The dye is of ancient origin; jars of kermes have been found in a Neolithic cave-burial at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rhône. Similar dyes are extracted from the related insects \"Porphyrophora hamelii\" (Armenian cochineal) of the Caucasus region, \"Porphyrophora polonica\" (Polish cochineal or Saint John's blood) of Eastern Europe, and the lac-producing insects of India, Southeast Asia, China, and Tibet.\n\nWhen kermes-dyed textiles achieved prominence around the mid-11th century, the dyestuff was called \"grain\" in all Western European languages because the desiccated eggs resemble fine grains of wheat or sand. Textiles dyed with kermes were described as \"dyed in the grain\". Woollens were frequently dyed in the fleece with woad and then piece-dyed in kermes, producing a wide range colors from blacks and grays through browns, murreys, purples, and sanguines. By the 14th and early 15th century, brilliant \"full grain\" kermes scarlet was \"by far the most esteemed, most regal\" color for luxury woollen textiles in the Low Countries, England, France, Spain and Italy.\n\nCochineal (\"Dactylopius coccus\") is a scale insect of Central and North America from which the crimson-coloured dye carmine is derived. It was used by the Aztec and Maya peoples. Moctezuma in the 15th century collected tribute in the form of bags of cochineal dye. Soon after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire cochineal began to be exported to Spain, and by the seventeenth century it was a commodity traded as far away as India. During the colonial period the production of cochineal (in Spanish, \"grana fina\") grew rapidly. Produced almost exclusively in Oaxaca by indigenous producers, cochineal became Mexico's second most valued export after silver. Cochineal produces purplish colors alone and brilliant scarlets when mordanted with tin; thus cochineal, which produced a stronger dye and could thus be used in smaller quantities, replaced kermes dyes in general use in Europe from the 17th century.\n\nDuring the course of the 15th century, the civic records show brilliant reds falling out of fashion for civic and high-status garments in the Duchy of Burgundy in favor of dark blues, greens, and most important of all, black. The origins of the trend for somber colors are elusive, but are generally attributed to the growing influence of Spain and possibly the importation of Spanish merino wools. The trend spread in the next century: the Low Countries, German states, Scandinavia, England, France, and Italy all absorbed the sobering and formal influence of Spanish dress after the mid-1520s.\n\nProducing fast black in the Middle Ages was a complicated process involving multiple dyeings with woad or indigo followed by mordanting, but at the dawn of Early Modern period, a new and superior method of dyeing black dye reached Europe via Spanish conquests in the New World. The new method used logwood (\"Haematoxylum campechianum\"), a dyewood native to Mexico and Central America. Although logwood was poorly received at first, producing a blue inferior to that of woad and indigo, it was discovered to produce a fast black in combination with a ferrous sulfate (copperas) mordant. Despite changing fashions in color, logwood was the most widely used dye by the 19th century, providing the sober blacks of formal and mourning clothes.\n\nThe first synthetic dyes were discovered in the mid-19th century, starting with William Henry Perkin's mauveine in 1856, an aniline dye derived from coal tar. Alizarin, the red dye present in madder, was the first natural pigment to be duplicated synthetically, in 1869, leading to the collapse of the market for naturally grown madder. The development of new, strongly colored aniline dyes followed quickly: a range of reddish-purples, blues, violets, greens and reds became available by 1880. These dyes had great affinity for animal fibres such as wool and silk. The new colors tended to fade and wash out, but they were inexpensive and could be produced in the vast quantities required by textile production in the industrial revolution. By the 1870s commercial dyeing with natural dyestuffs was fast disappearing.\n\nAt the same time the Pre-Raphaelite artist and founding figure of the Arts and Crafts movement William Morris took up the art of dyeing as an adjunct to his manufacturing business, the design firm of Morris & Co. Always a medievalist at heart, Morris loathed the colors produced by the fashionable aniline dyes. He spent much of his time at his Staffordshire dye works mastering the processes of dyeing with plant materials and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo dyeing as a practical industry and generally to renew the use of natural dyes like madder which had been driven almost out of use by the commercial success of the anilines. Morris saw dyeing of wools, silks, and cottons as the necessary preliminary to the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and his period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–76) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877–78), and more especially in the revival of carpet- and tapestry-weaving as fine arts. Morris & Co. also provided naturally dyed silks for the embroidery style called art needlework.\n\nScientists continued to search for new synthetic dyes that would be effective on cellulose fibres like cotton and linen, and that would be more colorfast on wool and silk than the early anilines. Chrome or mordant dyes produced a muted but very fast color range for woollens. These were followed by acid dyes for animal fibres (from 1875) and the synthesis of indigo in Germany in 1880. The work on indigo led to the development of a new class of dyes called vat dyes in 1901 that produced a wide range of fast colors for cellulosic fibers such as cotton. Disperse dyes were introduced in 1923 to color the new textiles of cellulose acetate, which could not be colored with any existing dyes. Today disperse dyes are the only effective means of coloring many synthetics. Reactive dyes for cotton were introduced in the mid-1950s. These petroleum based, synthetic dyes are used both in commercial textile production and in craft dyeing and have widely replaced natural dyes.\n\nIn America, synthetic dyes became popular among a wide range of Native American textile artists; however, natural dyes remained in use, as many textile collectors prefer natural dyes over synthetics. Today, dyeing with natural materials is often practiced as an adjunct to handspinning, knitting and weaving. It remains a living craft in many traditional cultures of North America, Africa, Asia, and the Scottish Highlands.\n\n\"The section on William Morris incorporates text from the\" Dictionary of National Biography,\" supplemental volume 3 (1901), a publication now in the public domain.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Hunt, 1979). Petroleum is generally considered oil and natural gases having various compounds composed of primarily hydrogen and carbon. They are usually generated from the decomposition and/or thermal maturation of organic matter. The organic matter originated from plants and algae. The organic matter is deposited after the death of the plant in sediments, where after considerable time, heat, and pressure the compounds in the plants and algae are altered to oil, gas, and kerogen. Kerogen can be thought of as the remaining solid material of the plant. The sediment - usually clay and/or calcareous (lime) ooze, hardens during this alteration process into rock i.e. shale and/or limestone. The shale or limestone rock containing the organic matter is called the source rock because it is the source, having generated the petroleum.\n\nIn our quest to find more oil and gas, we use numerous petroleum geochemical techniques to (1) identify source rocks and determine the amount, type, and maturation level of the organic matter; (2) evaluate the potential timing of petroleum migration from the source rock; (3) assess the potential migration pathways; and (4) correlate petroleum compounds found in reservoirs, leaks, and surface seeps to find new pools of petroleum. Some of the petroleum geochemical techniques used are: stable isotopes; hydrocarbon analysis (fingerprinting) of specific organic compounds (biological organic markers) with gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS); maturity indicators like vitrinite reflectance; laboratory pyrolysis and analysis; kerogen typing; and other more exotic techniques.\n"}

On 18 August 1948, the then 24-year-old left behind her aeronautical engineer husband Norman and their 18-month-old daughter Anna, and took off from Croydon, England, in a single-engine Percival Proctor IV \"G-AJMU\", with 25-year-old Cambridge University graduate student Michael Townsend as navigator. She named the aircraft \"Thursday's Child\" (who \"has far to go\" in the nursery rhyme \"Monday's Child\").\n\nThey traveled east. There were rough landings in Marseille (causing minor damage) and Cyprus. They also had to wait nearly seven weeks in Calcutta, India, to replace the engine. In Japan, extra fuel tanks were installed in the fuselage for the long flight across the Pacific Ocean. Even so, they reached Shemya Air Force Base in the Aleutians perilously low on fuel. On 21 November 1948, they took off from Anchorage, Alaska. However, the engine developed trouble and they were forced to land on the snow-covered Alaska Highway near Tok, Alaska. The situation looked bleak. They were nearly out of funds, and the aircraft was unrepairable.\n\nTownsend returned to England to resume his studies, while Morrow-Tait set about trying to raise money to continue her journey. Impressed by her resolve, some Americans started a fundraising drive and collected enough to buy her a 1942 Vultee Valiant (NX54084), which she christened \"Next Thursday's Child\".

The term \"speleology\" is also sometimes applied to the recreational activity of exploring caves, but this is more properly known as \"caving\" or \"potholing\", or (not usually by participants) by the uncommon American term \"spelunking\". Speleology and caving are often connected, as the physical skills required for \"in situ\" study are the same.\n\nSpeleology is a cross-disciplinary field that combines the knowledge of chemistry, biology, geology, physics, meteorology and cartography to develop portraits of caves as complex, evolving systems.\n\nPrior to the mid-nineteenth century the scientific value of caves was considered only in its contribution to other branches of science, and cave studies were considered part of the larger disciplines of geography, geology or archaeology. Very little cave-specific study was undertaken prior to the work of Édouard-Alfred Martel (1859–1938), the 'father of modern speleology', who through his extensive and well-publicised cave explorations introduced in France the concept of speleology as a distinct area of study. In 1895 Martel founded the Société de Spéléologie, the first organization devoted to cave science in the world.\n\nThe growth of speleology is directly linked with that of the sport of caving, both because of the stimulation of public interest and awareness, and the fact that most speleological field-work has been conducted by sport cavers.\n\nThe creation of an accurate, detailed map is one of the most common technical activities undertaken within a cave. Cave maps, called \"surveys\", can be used to compare caves to each other by length, depth and volume, may reveal clues on speleogenesis, provide a spatial reference for further scientific study, and assist visitors with route-finding.\n\nCaves provide a home for many unique biota. Cave ecologies are very diverse, and not sharply distinct from surface habitats. Generally however, the deeper the cave becomes, the more rarefied the ecology.\n\nCave environments fall into three general categories:\n\nCave organisms fall into three basic classes:\n\nThere are also so-called \"accidental trogloxenes\" which are surface organisms that enter caves for no survival reason. Some may even be \"troglophobes\" (“cave haters”), which cannot survive in caves for any extended period. Examples include deer which fell through a sinkhole, frogs swept into a cave by a flash flood, etc.\n\nThe two factors that limit cave ecologies are generally energy and nutrients. To some degree moisture is always available in actively forming Karst caves. Cut off from the sunlight and steady deposition of plant detritus, caves are poor habitats in comparison with wet areas on the surface. The majority of energy in cave environments comes from the surplus of the ecosystems outside. One major source of energy and nutrients in caves is dung from trogloxenes, the majority of which is deposited by bats. Other sources are mentioned above.\n\nCave ecosystems are very fragile. Because of their rarity and position in the ecosystem they are threatened by a large number of human activities. Dam construction, limestone quarrying, water pollution and logging are just some of the disasters that can devastate or destroy underground biological communities.\n\nSpeleologists also work with archaeologists in studying underground ruins, tunnels, sewers and aqueducts, such as the various inlets and outlets of the Cloaca Maxima in Rome.\n\n"}

{"id": "1175180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1175180", "title": "Three-phase", "text": "Three-phase\n\nIn electrical engineering, three-phase electric power systems have at least three conductors carrying alternating current voltages that are offset in time by one-third of the period. A three-phase system may be arranged in delta (∆) or star (Y) (also denoted as wye in some areas). A wye system allows the use of two different voltages from all three phases, such as a 230/400 V system which provides 230 V between the neutral (centre hub) and any one of the phases, and 400 V across any two phases. A delta system arrangement only provides one voltage magnitude, however it has a greater redundancy as it may continue to operate normally with one of the three supply windings offline, albeit at 57.7% of total capacity. Harmonic current in the neutral may become very large if non-linear loads are connected.\n\nIn a star (wye) connected topology, with rotation sequence L1 - L2 - L3, the time-varying instantaneous voltages can be calculated for each phase A,C,B respectively by:\n\nwhere:\n\nGenerally, in electric power systems, the loads are distributed as evenly as is practical between the phases. It is usual practice to discuss a balanced system first and then describe the effects of unbalanced systems as deviations from the elementary case.\n\nAn important property of three-phase power is that the instantaneous power available to a resistive load, formula_8, is constant at all times. Indeed, let \n\nTo simplify the mathematics, we define a nondimensionalized power for intermediate calculations, formula_10\n\nHence (substituting back):\n\nSince we have eliminated formula_13 we can see that the total power does not vary with time. This is essential for keeping large generators and motors running smoothly.\n\nNotice also that using the root mean square voltage formula_14, the expression for formula_15 above takes the following more classic form:\n\nThe load need not be resistive for achieving a constant instantaneous power since, as long as it is balanced or the same for all phases, it may be written as\n\nso that the peak current is\n\nfor all phases and the instantaneous currents are\n\nNow the instantaneous powers in the phases are\n\nUsing angle subtraction formulae:\n\nwhich add up for a total instantaneous power\n\nSince the three terms enclosed in square brackets are a three-phase system, they add up to zero and the total power becomes\n\nor\nshowing the above contention.\n\nAgain, using the root mean square voltage formula_14, formula_15 can be written in the usual form\n\nFor the case of equal loads on each of three phases, no net current flows in the neutral. The neutral current is the inverted vector sum of the line currents. See Kirchhoff's circuit laws.\n\nWe define a non-dimensionalized current, formula_35:\n\nSince we have shown that the neutral current is zero we can see that removing the neutral core will have no effect on the circuit, provided the system is balanced. Such connections are generally used only when the load on the three phases is part of the same piece of equipment (for example a three-phase motor), as otherwise switching loads and slight imbalances would cause large voltage fluctuations.\n\nIn practice, systems rarely have perfectly balanced loads, currents, voltages and impedances in all three phases. The analysis of unbalanced cases is greatly simplified by the use of the techniques of symmetrical components. An unbalanced system is analysed as the superposition of three balanced systems, each with the positive, negative or zero sequence of balanced voltages.\n\nWhen specifying wiring sizes in a three-phase system, we only need to know the magnitude of the phase and neutral currents. The neutral current can be determined by adding the three phase currents together as complex numbers and then converting from rectangular to polar co-ordinates. If the three-phase root mean square (RMS) currents are formula_37, formula_38, and formula_39, the neutral RMS current is:\n\nwhich resolves to\n\nThe polar magnitude of this is the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts, which reduces to\n\nWith linear loads, the neutral only carries the current due to imbalance between the phases. Devices that utilize rectifier-capacitor front ends (such as switch-mode power supplies for computers, office equipment and the like) introduce third order harmonics. Third harmonic currents are in-phase on each of the supply phases and therefore will add together in the neutral which can cause the neutral current in a wye system to exceed the phase currents.\n\nAny polyphase system, by virtue of the time displacement of the currents in the phases, makes it possible to easily generate a magnetic field that revolves at the line frequency. Such a revolving magnetic field makes polyphase induction motors possible. Indeed, where induction motors must run on single-phase power (such as is usually distributed in homes), the motor must contain some mechanism to produce a revolving field, otherwise the motor cannot generate any stand-still torque and will not start. The field produced by a single-phase winding can provide energy to a motor already rotating, but without auxiliary mechanisms the motor will not accelerate from a stop when energized.\n\nA rotating magnetic field of steady amplitude requires that all three phase currents be equal in magnitude, and accurately displaced one-third of a cycle in phase. Unbalanced operation results in undesirable effects on motors and generators.\n\nProvided two voltage waveforms have at least some relative displacement on the time axis, other than a multiple of a half-cycle, any other polyphase set of voltages can be obtained by an array of passive transformers. Such arrays will evenly balance the polyphase load between the phases of the source system. For example, balanced two-phase power can be obtained from a three-phase network by using two specially constructed transformers, with taps at 50% and 86.6% of the primary voltage. This \"Scott T\" connection produces a true two-phase system with 90° time difference between the phases. Another example is the generation of higher-phase-order systems for large rectifier systems, to produce a smoother DC output and to reduce the harmonic currents in the supply.\n\nWhen three-phase is needed but only single-phase is readily available from the electricity supplier, a phase converter can be used to generate three-phase power from the single phase supply.\n\nIt is possible to measure the power in a three-phase system using two transducers when there is no neutral, or three transducers when there is neutral. Blondel's theorem states that the number of measurement elements required is one less than the number of current-carrying conductors.\n\n"}

The TCCON ( ) began in 2004 with the installation of the first instrument in Park Falls, Wisconsin, USA, and has since grown to 23 operational instruments worldwide, with 7 former sites. The TCCON is designed to investigate several things, including the flow (or flux) of carbon between the atmosphere, land, and ocean (the so-called carbon budget or carbon cycle). This is achieved by measuring the atmospheric mass of carbon (the airborne fraction). The TCCON measurements have improved the scientific community's understanding of the carbon cycle, and urban greenhouse gas emissions. The TCCON supports several satellite instruments by providing an independent measurement to compare (or validate) the satellite measurements of the atmosphere over the TCCON site locations. The TCCON provides the primary measurement validation dataset for the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) mission, and has been used to validate other space-based measurements of carbon dioxide.\n\nPart of the reason the TCCON was established was because of modeling errors between mixing efficiency between the PBL and the free troposphere. Because TCCON measurements are of the entire column of atmosphere above a site (PBL and free troposphere are simultaneously measured) the measurements are an improvement over the traditional in situ near surface measurements in this regard. TCCON has improved the CO mass gradient measurements between the northern and southern hemispheres.\n\nThe first annual TCCON meeting was in San Francisco, California in 2005. Every year a meeting is held in a location that rotates between North America, the Western Pacific, and Europe hosted by a participating institution. In 2015 the meeting was held at the University of Toronto.\n\nThe main instrument at each TCCON site is a Bruker IFS 125HR (HR for high resolution, ~0.02 cm) or occasionally 120HR Fourier transform spectrometer. Sunlight is directed into the spectrometer by solar tracking mirrors and other optics. The spectrometers measure the absorption of direct sunlight by atmospheric trace gases primarily in the near infrared region. This remote sensing technique produces a precise and accurate measurement of the total column abundance of the trace gas. The main limitation to this technique is that measurements can not be recorded when it is not sunny (i.e. there are no measurements available at nighttime or when there is heavy cloud cover).\n\nCurrent TCCON sites are located in the United States, Canada, Germany, Poland, France, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Réunion, and Ascension Island. A former site was in Brazil. Sites can change when an instrument needs to be moved to a new location.\n\nTCCON members collaborate from a variety of different institutions. In North America some of these include Caltech, JPL, Los Alamos National Laboratory, NASA Ames, and the University of Toronto. In Europe some of these include Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, University of Bremen, Agencia Estatal de Meteorología, Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy, Finnish Meteorological Institute, and Pierre and Marie Curie University. In the western Pacific some of these include University of Wollongong, National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, National Institute for Environmental Studies, JAXA, and National Institute of Meteorological Research of the Republic of Korea.\n\nNew sites are admitted into the network when site investigators demonstrate required hardware, and data processing ability. Uniformity is maintained across the network by using the same FTS model and the same retrieval software. GGG is the software of the TCCON. It includes the I2S (interferogram to spectrum) FFT, and GFIT spectral fitting subroutines. GFIT is also the fitting algorithm that was used for ATMOS which flew on the Space Shuttle, and is used for spectral fitting of spectra obtained by a balloon borne spectrometer.\n\nData from each site is processed by the investigators that head that particular site. Atmospheric abundances of gases are uploaded and saved in uniform formats and data are hosted at Caltech with the Caltech Library and are available from http://tccondata.org. Data are made publicly available provided the data license is followed.\n\nData have been used for a variety of analyses. Some of these include\n\nThe satellite missions supported by the TCCON include the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), SCIAMACHY, and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2).\n\n"}

The first of the yachts' journeys after it was acquired was its voyage from Gosport to Mumbai, India. Subsequently the yacht embarked on its most notable voyage, the circumnavigation of the globe from 1985 to 1987. This was the first such achievement by an Indian crew. In subsequent years, the yacht has been used for international cruises primarily in the Indian Ocean region and is currently still operational.\n\nThe Sapper Adventure Foundation had sponsored a sailing expedition from Bombay to Bandar Abbas, Iran in 1977 in an 18-foot 1921-vintage wooden Seabird Class sailboat \"Albatross\".

The ulvöspinel component tends to oxidize to magnetite plus ilmenite during subsolidus cooling of the host rocks, and the ilmenite so produced may form apparent exsolution (trellis type) laminae in magnetite.

In its early stages, the Vaiśeṣika was an independent philosophy with its own metaphysics, epistemology, logic, ethics, and soteriology. Over time, the Vaiśeṣika system became similar in its philosophical procedures, ethical conclusions and soteriology to the Nyāya school of Hinduism, but retained its difference in epistemology and metaphysics.\n\nThe epistemology of Vaiśeṣika school of Hinduism, like Buddhism, accepted only two reliable means to knowledge: perception and inference. Vaiśeṣika school and Buddhism both consider their respective scriptures as indisputable and valid means to knowledge, the difference being that the scriptures held to be a valid and reliable source by Vaiśeṣikas were the Vedas.\n\nVaisheshika school is known for its insights in naturalism. It is a form of atomism in natural philosophy. It postulated that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to \"paramāṇu\" (atoms), and one's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), quality, activity, commonness, particularity and inherence. According to Vaiśeṣika school, knowledge and liberation were achievable by a complete understanding of the world of experience.\n\nVaiśeṣika darshana was founded by Kaṇāda Kashyapa around the 6th to 2nd century BC.\n\nAlthough the Vaisheshika system developed independently from the Nyaya school of Hinduism, the two became similar and are often studied together. In its classical form, however, the Vaishesika school differed from the Nyaya in one crucial respect: where Nyaya accepted four sources of valid knowledge, the Vaishesika accepted only two.\n\nThe epistemology of Vaiśeṣika school of Hinduism accepted only two reliable means to knowledge - perception and inference.\n\nVaisheshika espouses a form of atomism, that the reality is composed of five substances (examples are earth, water, air, fire, and space). Each of these five are of two types, explains Ganeri, (paramāṇu) and composite. An Parmanu (Para means beyond and Anu means Atom or very small but divisible particle while parmanu is indivisible) is that which is indestructible , indivisible, and has a special kind of dimension, called “small” (aṇu). A composite is that which is divisible into parmanu. Whatever human beings perceive is composite, and even the smallest perceptible thing, namely, a fleck of dust, has parts, which are therefore invisible. The Vaiśeṣikas visualized the smallest composite thing as a “triad” (tryaṇuka) with three parts, each part with a “dyad” (dyaṇuka). Vaiśeṣikas believed that a dyad has two parts, each of which is an atom. Size, form, truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of parmanus, their number and their spatial arrangements.\n\nVaisheshika postulated that what one experiences is derived from \"dravya\" (substance: a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), \"guna\" (quality), \"karma\" (activity), \"samanya\" (commonness), \"vishesha\" (particularity) and \"samavaya\" (inherence, inseparable connectedness of everything).\n\nHinduism identifies six \"Pramāṇas\" as epistemically reliable means to accurate knowledge and to truths: \"Pratyakṣa\" (perception), \"Anumāna\" (inference), \"Upamāna\" (comparison and analogy), \"Arthāpatti\" (postulation, derivation from circumstances), \"Anupalabdhi\" (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and \"Śabda\" (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts). Of these epistemology considered only \"pratyakṣa\" (perception) and (inference) as reliable means of valid knowledge. Nyaya school, related to Vaiśeṣika, accepts four out of these six.\n\nThe syllogism of the school was similar to that of the Nyāya school of Hinduism, but the names given by to the 5 members of syllogism are different.\n\nThe earliest systematic exposition of the Vaisheshika is found in the of (or ). This treatise is divided into ten books. The two commentaries on the , and are no more extant. ’s (c. 4th century) is the next important work of this school. Though commonly known as of , this treatise is basically an independent work on the subject. The next Vaisheshika treatise, Candra’s (648) based on ’s treatise is available only in Chinese translation. The earliest commentary available on ’s treatise is ’s (8th century). The other three commentaries are ’s (991), Udayana’s (10th century) and ’s (11th century). ’s which also belongs to the same period, presents the and the principles as a part of one whole. ’s on is also an important work.\n\nAccording to the Vaisheshika school, all things that exist, that can be cognized and named are s (literal meaning: the meaning of a word), the objects of experience. All objects of experience can be classified into six categories, \"dravya\" (substance), (quality), \"karma\" (activity), (generality), (particularity) and (inherence). Later s ( and Udayana and ) added one more category \"abhava\" (non-existence). The first three categories are defined as \"artha\" (which can perceived) and they have real objective existence. The last three categories are defined as (product of intellectual discrimination) and they are logical categories.\n\n\nAccording to the school, the are the smallest \"mahat\" (perceivable) particles and defined as s (triads). These are made of three parts, each of which are defined as (dyad). The s are conceived as made of two parts, each of which are defined as (atom). The s (atoms) are indivisible and eternal, they can neither be created nor destroyed. Each (atom) possesses its own distinct (individuality).\n\nThe measure of the partless atoms is known as \"parimaṇḍala parimāṇa\". It is eternal and it cannot generate the measure of any other substance. Its measure is its own absolutely.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The effort includes 64 collaborating centres that have been designated as such by the WHO director-general. The centres in the network meet triennially to develop work plans for advancing occupational health in key areas. The 2009-2012 work plan includes 220 projects, which relate to 5 objectives and 14 priorities as outlined by a global plan of action for workers' health. \n\nAs director of the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, John Howard is the chairman of the WHO Global Network of Collaborating Centres in Occupational Health. Within the network, activity area managers plan day-to-day activities within projects adopted by the network. Deputy managers monitor activities and evaluate progress of the involved centres.\n\nThe global plan of action sets forth five major objectives:\nUsing these key goals, the activity area managers have set priorities for specific areas of occupational health.\n\nCentres in the network are designated by the WHO director-general. Seven organizations constitute the network's advisory committee:\n\nOther participants working with the centres include the International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Commission on Occupational Health (ICOH), the International Occupational Hygiene Association (IOHA), and the International Ergonomics Association (IEA).\n\nThe collaborating centres have participated in a number of conferences, provided research on occupational safety and health topics, and engaged in varied campaigns and activities such as an inititiative promoting global road safety for workers.\n"}
