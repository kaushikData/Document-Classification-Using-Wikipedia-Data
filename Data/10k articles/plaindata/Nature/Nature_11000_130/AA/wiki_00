The syncarp of \"Ficus\" species supplies shelter and food for fig wasps and, in turn, the trees are totally dependent on the fig wasps for pollination.\n\nFrugivore birds disperse the seeds of banyans. The seeds are small, and because most banyans grow in woodlands, a seedling that germinates on the ground is unlikely to survive. However, many seeds fall on the branches and stems of other trees or on human edifices, and when they germinate they grow roots down toward the ground and consequently may envelop part of the host tree or edifice. For this reason banyans bear the colloquial name \"strangler fig\". A number of tropical banyan species that compete for sunlight, especially of the genus \"Ficus\", exhibit this strangling habit.\n\nThe leaves of the banyan tree are large, leathery, glossy, green, and elliptical. Like most figs, the leaf bud is covered by two large scales. As the leaf develops the scales abscise. Young leaves have an attractive reddish tinge.\n\nOlder banyan trees are characterized by aerial prop roots that mature into thick, woody trunks, which can become indistinguishable from the primary trunk with age. Old trees can spread laterally by using these prop roots to grow over a wide area. In some species, the prop roots develop over a considerable area that resembles a grove of trees, with every trunk connected directly or indirectly to the primary trunk. The topology of this massive root system inspired the name of the hierarchical computer network operating system \"Banyan VINES\".\nIn a banyan that envelops its host tree, the mesh of roots growing around the latter eventually applies considerable pressure to and commonly kills it. Such an enveloped, dead tree eventually decomposes, so that the banyan becomes a \"columnar tree\" with a hollow, central core. In jungles, such hollows are very desirable shelters to many animals.\n\nDifferent parts of the tree are known to be helpful in treating diseases like dysentery, diarrhea, diabetes, leucorrhoea, menorrhagia and nervous disorders. Banyan trees have many different health benefits due to the many endophytes that they host in their aerial roots. These endophytes have a symbiotic relationship with the tree by providing the tree with protection from microbes, and the tree in return hosts the endophytes. These endophytes also help the tree by protecting them against pathogens and by helping their fitness by nitrogen fixation.\n\nIn an experiment, these endophytes from the aerial roots of a banyan tree were examined to see how well they would be able to fight off certain bacteria strains that highly affect different plants. An ICMS approach was used to test the virulence of the endophytes against the bacteria. The results indicate that there is a broad spectrum of anti-fungal activity present in the tree's aerial roots that can be used as anti-fungal agents in other plants as well, after further development. The banyan tree is a versatile organism that is highly adapted to its environment. Its aerial roots help it survive in a warm and moist environment as well as provide the large tree with structural support. It also has adapted to having symbiotic relationships with many organisms spanning from endophytes to humans. For example, the tree hosts the endophytes and the endophytes provide it protection from pathogens and nutrients. The tree can provide humans shelter as well as many different health-related benefits like antioxidants from its bark.\n\nThe name was originally given to \"F. benghalensis\" and comes from India, where early travellers observed that the shade of the tree was frequented by \"Banyans\" (a corruption of Baniyas, a community of Indian traders).\n\nIn the Gujarati language, \"banya\" means \"grocer or merchant\", not \"tree\". The Portuguese picked up the word to refer specifically to Hindu merchants, and passed it along to the English as early as 1599 with the same meaning. By 1634, English writers began to tell of the banyan tree, a tree under which Hindu merchants conducted their business. The tree provided a shaded place for a village meeting or for merchants to sell their goods. Eventually, \"banyan\" became the name of the tree itself.\n\nThe original banyan, \"F. benghalensis\", can grow into a giant tree covering several hectares. Over time, the name became generalized to all strangler figs of the \"Urostigma\" subgenus. The many banyan species include:\n\nDue to the complex structure of the roots and extensive branching, the banyan is used as a subject specimen in penjing and bonsai. The oldest, living bonsai in Taiwan is a 240-year-old banyan tree housed in Tainan.\n\nBanyan trees figure prominently in several Asian and Pacific religions and myths, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term \"biocontainment\" was coined in 1985, but the concept stretches back at least to the 1940s.\n\nPrimary containment is the first container in direct contact with biohazardous material as well as protection of personnel and the immediate laboratory environment from exposure to infectious agents. Primary containment requires using proper storage containers, good microbiological technique, and the use of appropriate safety equipment such as biological safety cabinets.\n\nSecondary containment is the protection of the environment external to the laboratory from exposure to infectious materials and is provided by a combination of facility design and operational practices.\n\nBiological safety cabinets (BSC), first commercially available in 1950, are fairly common devices designed to provide effective primary biocontainment in laboratories working with highly infectious agents. Three general levels and types have been devised (Class I, Class II, and Class III).\n\nBiosafety suites are suites of laboratory rooms which are essentially equivalent to large Class III cabinets in which positive pressure personnel suits (\"space suits\") serve as the \"outside\" environment for workers. Examples include the biosafety suites at USAMRIID at Fort Detrick, Maryland, USA and the Maximum Containment Facility (MCF) of the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.\n\nAgricultural containment: The term “biocontainment” is used differently in facilities for the study of human pathogens versus those used for the study of agricultural pathogens. In agricultural facilities, the definition for “biocontainment” resembles that for “biosafety,” i.e., the safety practices and procedures used to prevent unintended infection of plants or animals or the release of high-consequence pathogenic agents into the environment (air, soil, or water). In the agricultural setting, worker protection and public health are always considerations; however, emphasis is placed on reducing the risk that agents under study could escape into the environment.\n\nA \"biosafety level\" (BSL) is the level of the biocontainment precautions required to isolate dangerous biological agents in an enclosed laboratory facility. The levels of containment range from the lowest biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) to the highest at level 4 (BSL-4). In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have specified these levels. In the European Union, the same biosafety levels are defined in a directive.\n\nToday, guiding publications for biosafety and containment in the US are set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Since 1984, the CDC and the NIH have jointly authored the \"Biosafety in Microbiological and Medical Laboratories\" (\"BMBL\") and the separately-published section of the \"BMBL\", Appendix A: \"Primary Containment for Biohazards: Selection, Installation, and Use of Biosafety Cabinets\". The \"BMBL\" sets national regulations for Biosafety Levels, Containment, Decontamination and Disinfection, Transportation, and Disposal of biohazardous agents.\n\n\nCitations\nAlso:\n"}

He was the founding hero of their civilization, who according to legend brought morals and laws to the people and taught them agriculture and other crafts.\n\nSimilarly to the Incan god Viracocha, the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl and several other deities from Central and South American pantheons, Bochica is described in legends as being bearded. The beard, once mistaken as a mark of a prehistoric European influence and quickly fueled and embellished by spirits of the colonial era, had its single significance in the continentally insular culture of Mesoamerica. The \"Anales de Cuauhtitlan\" is a very important early source which is particularly valuable for having been originally written in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec. The \"Anales de Cuauhtitlan\" describes the attire of Quetzalcoatl at Tula:\n\nImmediately he made him his green mask; he took red color with which he made the lips russet; he took yellow to make the facade; and he made the fangs; continuing, he made his beard of feathers...\" (\"Anales de Cuauhtitlan\", 1975, 9.)\n\nIn this quote the beard is represented as a dressing of feathers, fitting comfortably with academic impressions of Mesoamerican art. The connotation of the word 'beard' by Spanish colonizers was grossly abused as foundation for embellishment and fabrication of an original European influence in Mesoamerica.\n\nNot one cultural representation of either of these gods, painted, sculpted, et cetera, show them bearded in any sense the Spanish colonizers believed they would have been. There is no evidence in the abundance of Mesoamerican art of European influence, most stridently ruled out by the likenesses they gave themselves and their gods.\n\nThere have been questions on the authenticity of the preserved stories, and to what level they have been corrupted by the beliefs and imagery incorporated by Spanish Christian missionaries and monks who first chronicled the native legends.\n\nAccording to Chibcha legends, Bochica was a bearded man who came from the east. He taught the primitive Chibcha people ethical and moral norms and gave them a model by which to organize their states, with one spiritual and one secular leader. Bochica also taught the people agriculture, metalworking and other crafts before leaving for the west to live as an ascetic. When the Muisca later forsook the teachings of Bochica and turned to a life of excess, a flood engulfed the Savannah of Bogotá, where they lived. Upon appealing for aid from their hero, Bochica returned on a rainbow and with a strike from his staff, created the Tequendama Falls, through which the floodwaters could drain away.\n\nBochica appeared in Pasca in Cundinamarca and later in Gámeza, Boyacá where the people showed him hospitability. He retreated in the Toya cave where many \"caciques\" visited him for wisdom. \"Caciques\" from Tópaga, Tota, Pesca, Firavitoba and others consulted Bochica. After the supreme being of the Muisca, Chiminigagua sent them to Sugamuxi the city became a sacred place where the Temple of the Sun would be erected and religious festivities organised around the arrival of Bochica.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1095055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1095055", "title": "Catechumen", "text": "Catechumen\n\nIn ecclesiology, a catechumen (; via Latin \"catechumenus\" from Greek κατηχούμενος \"katēkhoumenos\", \"one being instructed\", from κατά \"kata\", \"down\" and ἦχος \"ēkhos\", \"sound\") is a person receiving instruction from a catechist in the principles of the Christian religion with a view to baptism. The title and practice is most often used by Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, Orthodox, Reformed/Presbyterian, and Roman Catholic Christians. Ecumenical organisations such as the North American Association for the Catechumenate are helping to, across several denominations, \"shape ministries with adult seekers involving an extended time of faith formation and a meaningful experience of adult baptism at Easter.\"\n\nThe word catechumen comes from the passive form of the Greek word κατηχέω (katēcheō), which is used seven times in the New Testamen. In the passive, it means \"to be instructed, informed.\"\n\nThe catechumenate slowly developed from the development of doctrine and the need to test converts against the dangers of falling away. The Bible records (Acts 19) that the Apostle Paul while visiting some people who were described as \"disciples\", established they had received the baptism of John for the repentance of sins but had not yet heard of or received the Holy Spirit. Further, from the second century it appears that baptisms were held only at certain times of year, indicating that periods of instruction were the rule rather than the exception. The Catholic Encyclopedia notes: \"As the acceptance of Christianity involved belief in a body of doctrine and the observance of the Divine law (\"teach, make disciples, scholars of them\"; \"teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you\", Matthew 28:20 [see Great Commission]), it is clear that some sort of preliminary instruction must have been given to the converts.\" See also Council of Jerusalem. Justin Martyr, in his \"First Apology\", cites instruction as occurring prior to baptism:\n\nThe \"persuasion\" would be carried out by the preaching of an evangelist; but since belief must precede baptism, the person concerned should be prepared spiritually to receive the indwelling of the Holy Spirit through baptism. That person would receive the sign of the Cross and possibly aspersion with holy water from a minister, indicating their entry to the state of catechumen.\n\nCatechumens were limited as to their attendance in formal services. As unbaptized, they could not actively take part in any service, for that was reserved for those baptized. One practice permitted them to remain in the first part of the mass, but even in the earliest centuries dismissed them before the Eucharist. Others had them entering through a side door, or observing from the side, from a gallery, or near the font; while it was not unknown to bar them from all services until baptized.\n\nTheir desire for baptism was held to be sufficient guarantee of their salvation, if they died before the reception. In event of their martyrdom prior to baptism by water, this was held to be a \"baptism by blood\" (Baptism of desire), and they were honored as martyrs.\n\nIn the fourth century, a widespread practice arose of enrolling as a catechumen and deferring baptism for years, often until shortly before death, and when so ill that the normal practice of immersion was impossible, so that aspersion or affusion—the baptism of the sick—was necessary. Constantine was the most prominent of these catechumens. See also Deathbed conversion.\n\nCyril of Jerusalem wrote a series of sermons aimed at catechumens, outlining via passages of scripture the main points of the faith, yet dividing between those merely interested and those intending baptism then continuing with certain sermons aimed at those who had been baptized.\n\nSt. Augustine was among those enrolled as a catechumen as an infant, and did not receive baptism until he was in his thirties. He, and other Fathers, fulminated against the practice.\n\n(Stub to include the development of the Roman/Greek catechisms, relationship to forced conversion, and conversion from one part of Christianity to another).\n\nIn no case is a catechumen absolutely bound to be baptized, preserving the principle that the recipient of a sacrament must not be forced against his will : the person concerned must be drawn spiritually to the faith in addition to being intellectually persuaded.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church revived the catechumenate with its Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults (RCIA) wherein being a catechumen is one of a number of stages leading to receiving the sacraments of initiation (baptism, confirmation, and the Eucharist). This was a result of the Second Vatican Council, explicitly stated in point 64 of the Constitution of the Sacred Liturgy, \"Sacrosanctum Concilium\":\n\nThe Neocatechumenal Way and the Light-Life Movement of the Roman Catholic Church take as their inspiration the old catechumenate of early Christianity (the \"primitive church\") as the basis for their goal of adult faith formation for Roman Catholics.\n\nIn many Protestant churches, particularly those preferring not to baptise infants, the catechumenate status may be considered the norm amongst the young. This is especially true amongst young Christadelphians, although they never use the specific term catechumenate, more normally referring to those in this state as \"being instructed\" or \"being taken through\".\n\nThe Protestant churches who baptize infants, for instance Anglican/Episcopalian and Lutheran, tend to follow a catechumenate which can be likened to a course in the fundamentals of the religion, lasting typically six months and ending with baptism at Easter. However, this is at the discretion of the local minister, and times may be varied. The 9th meeting of the Anglican Consultative Council in Cape Town, January 1993, stated among other points in Resolution 44:\n\nJehovah's Witnesses require a catechumenate of adherents prior to baptism by means of a study program led by a baptized minister, using a Watch Tower Society textbook that teaches basic Witness doctrines. Students initially progress to become an \"unbaptized publisher\" of the faith, preaching while continuing further biblical instruction—akin to a catechumen, although the term is not specifically used. After demonstrating sufficient comprehension and application of Jehovah's Witnesses' interpretations of the Bible, the student qualifies to be baptized as a Jehovah's Witness.\n\nA catechumen has not been baptized, and is undergoing training in the principles of the faith; one who was baptized as a child has an equal need of education, but this does not start from the same foundation, since baptism has already occurred. The theological basis is common to all sects and taken from the Gospel:\n\nfrom which the working of God on the catechumen is presupposed. Once baptized, the relationship with God is of a different order.\n\nSince the schisms between the parts of the Church, conversion between the denominations is also possible. Education in the specific doctrines of the sect is therefore seen as necessary, as well as a thorough grounding in the first principles of the faith. This latter may already have occurred when the convert is mature, and the status of catechumen is then usually not implied.\n\nThe three cases - baptized as an infant, come to the faith in maturer years, and conversion from one denomination to another - seem outwardly similar. This has led to discussions on their differentiation, notably the International Anglican Liturgical Consultation which, at its meeting in Toronto in 1991, stated that the catechumenate for those about to be baptized as infants was to be absolved by their parents and sponsors, thus defining the catechumenate as necessary for all, whether directly or by proxy. The status of the \"converted\" was dealt with at the same time, but in a way that cannot be considered typical of general Christian thinking, when it was declared that rebaptism was not to be thought of; as a consequence the previously baptized cannot become catechumens.\n\nThe remark in the foregoing section on \"stages of growth\" is important to understand this confusion, and happily this can also be seen as typical of the thinking outside the Anglican church. While all parts of the Church promote the growth from catechumen to novice to full member of the communion, the Protestant churches align it with the education of the young who are already baptized, whereas the Orthodox and Roman parts of the church keep this separate. Various terms are used to describe this process: \"alpha courses\", \"nursery courses\", \"starter groups\", among others. The main difference between denominations is whether these courses include or exclude those who are baptized, and an overlap with youth ministries and even to an extent with evangelism is observable. For further discussion not directly related to the state of catechumen, see other Wiki articles.\n\nThe form of education varied, though the earliest recorded methods were lists of questions and answers (Catechism). Sermons were also used (Cyril of Jerusalem). Most catechisms were divided into parts, aiming to follow the spiritual growth of the catechumen. There were certain differences between catechisms for the young baptized and for the unbaptized catechumen.\n\nThe divergence between Christian practice as regards catechumens (a formalised, gradual approach) and the idea of conversion (a sudden, overwhelming event) as the entry into the Church, is one of appearance rather than substance. It is recorded in the Bible that Paul the Apostle, who started out as a Jewish persecutor of the Church, underwent sudden conversion on the way to Damascus when Jesus Christ appeared to him in a vision. Regarded as the type of sudden conversion, this event was followed by baptism, with, however, a period of study and learning following, lasting a number of years. While there are examples of people being immediately baptised after having declared their faith, it seems that this was the exception rather than the rule (see above).\n\nQuoting Shaye J. D. Cohen: \"From the Maccabees to the Mishnah\" (1987)\n\"The Sadducees were the aristocratic opponents of the Pharisees. The Essenes were a group of religious and philosophic virtuosi, living a utopian life of the sort that would provoke the admiration of Jews and non-Jews alike. Josephus mentions their three-year catechumenate, their oath of loyalty to the group, their separation from their fellow Jews, their emphasis on purity and ablutions, but he regards them not as a \"sect\" but as a pietistic elite.\" See also Proselyte.\n\n\n"}

(September 21, 1901 – December 23, 1994) was an American physician who was known as a leader in the field of undersea and hyperbaric medicine, research, and education. Shilling was widely recognized as an expert on deep sea diving, naval medicine, radiation biology, and submarine capabilities. In 1939, he was Senior Medical Officer in the rescue of the submarine U.S.S. \"Squalus\".\n\nCharles Wesley Shilling was born September 21, 1901 in Indiana on the campus of Taylor University where his father was President. Shilling later went on to receive a Bachelor of Science from Taylor University along with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Michigan in 1923.\n\nAfter completion of his medical training at the University of Michigan, Shilling completed an internship at the Chelsea Naval Hospital.\n\nIn 1932, the Navy sent Shilling to the Harvard School of Public Health where he was joined by Albert R. Behnke.\n\nIn 1954, Shilling received an honorary Doctorate of Science from Taylor University.\n\nAfter joining the Navy in 1927, Shilling was sent to the Naval Submarine Base in New London, Connecticut where he was involved in the selection and training of submarine crew. Other work included research and development of Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment aboard the USS \"S-4\". Shilling was transferred to the submarine base in the Panama Canal Zone where he spent two years serving as medical officer aboard submarines as they traversed the canal. This work also included treating the medical problems associated with salvage diving operations.\n\nFrom Panama, Shilling was transferred to the Navy Diving School in Washington, DC where he learned to dive and began diving research at the Navy Experimental Diving Unit. Shilling researched the topics of nitrogen narcosis, oxygen toxicity, and decompression table development including important research on surface decompression.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Shilling was transferred back to the New London Submarine Base where he focused on hearing and vision for submariners. His work involved the development of the methods and tools needed for selection of sound listening and lookout duty. In 1939, a failed request for a $78.00 audiometer resulted in receiving $3,000.00. This small amount was spent to begin the first medical research laboratory dedicated to submarine research. This laboratory grew to become the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL).\nIn 1939, Shilling was the Senior Medical Officer in the rescue of personnel from the submarine USS \"Squalus\". Divers from the submarine rescue ship , under the direction of the salvage and rescue expert Charles Momsen, employed the new Rescue Chamber he had invented years earlier but which the US Navy command had repeatedly blocked. Earlier in development of the bell, they demonstrated that a bell could attach to a submarine torpedo room hatch but the submarine crew had not decided who should transfer to the surface in the bell. One of the crew stated, within Shilling's hearing, \"Take the Doc. He's the most useless piece of furniture we've got\". Shilling then became the first person to go from a submarine to the surface in a bell. Utilizing these techniques, they were able to rescue all 33 surviving crew members from the sunken submarine including future Rear Admiral Oliver F. Naquin. Shilling later recalled that the untested submarine rescue procedures utilized with the \"Squalus\" incident \"worked like a charm\". Later, the salvage divers used recently developed heliox diving schedules and successfully avoided the cognitive impairment symptoms associated with such deep dives, thereby confirming Behnke's theory of nitrogen narcosis.\n\nIn 1947, Shilling left NSMRL for a position in the Office of Naval Research (ONR). Four years of this post were spent directing medical, biological, and psychological studies and ended with two years as the director of the Research Division, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery as well as the special assistant for the BioSciences. During his time at ONR, he established the Committee on Hearing and the Committee on Vision for the Armed Services National Research Council.\n\nShilling's naval career ended with a post at the United States Naval Academy where he served as the Senior Medical Officer, Command Medical Officer for the Severn River Naval Command, and the head of the Department of Hygiene at ONR.\n\nUpon retirement from the Navy, Shilling served as deputy director, Division of Biology and Medicine at the United States Atomic Energy Commission from 1955 to 1960. Here he managed multimillion-dollar research programs.\n\nIn October 1961, Shilling was appointed to head the Biology Science Communications Project that was located at the American Institute of Biological Sciences and later moved to George Washington University. This project was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation to study \"all phases of the communications problems as they relate to the biological sciences and scientists\". A major focus of this project was indexing and abstracting the world serial publications and ensuring their availability in the United States. One important achievement was the organization of the Council of Biological Editors whose style guide provides guidelines for publications in the biological sciences.\n\nBy 1973, the Undersea Medical Society (UMS), now the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, had grown to the point of needing an office and hired Shilling as the first Executive secretary. Here, Shilling applied his knowledge in diving medicine and biological communications to establish the UMS scientific journal, \"Undersea Biomedical Research\". The journal continued under the name \"Undersea Biomedical Research\" until 1993 when it was changed to \"Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine Journal\".\n\nShilling's experience with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) in the treatment of decompression sickness allowed him to connect the diving community with the growing clinical HBO community. In 1975, Shilling gathered 50 experts in HBO therapy for a workshop conceived by Dr. Behnke. The workshop was chaired by Dr. Jefferson Davis and the group eventually published the definitive text \"Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy\". The UMS also created a committee to periodically review the scientific evidence supporting the use of HBO and the first \"Hyperbaric Oxygen Committee Report\" was published in 1977. Shilling served as Executive secretary until his retirement in 1987.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the UHMS, Shilling took a two-year post as Distinguished scientist at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.\n\nThe Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society's library was started by the efforts of Dr. Shilling. The UHMS Charles W. Shilling Library is the largest repository of diving and hyperbaric research and clinical information –current and historical–in the world. The library is located at the Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) Library in Durham, North Carolina. The collection consists of books, journals, reports, workshops, symposia, conference proceedings, and annotated bibliographies spanning the fields of diving, hyperbaric, and marine medicine. There is a small journal and newsletter collection dealing with diving safety and diving medicine. The library has extensive reprint files of articles, cataloged by author, related to diving and hyperbaric medicine and dating back to the 1930s.\n\nMany of the UHMS publications have been scanned and are available online at the Rubicon Research Repository. Other articles can be found in the DUMC Archive finding aids.\n\nShilling's portrait, painted by Daniel Thompson of the Corcoran Gallery and School of Art, was dedicated October 23, 1994.

Color superconducting phases are to be contrasted with the normal phase of quark matter, which is just a weakly interacting Fermi liquid of quarks.\n\nIn theoretical terms, a color superconducting phase is a state in which the quarks near the Fermi surface become correlated in Cooper pairs, which condense. In phenomenological terms, a color superconducting phase breaks some of the symmetries of the underlying theory, and has a very different spectrum of excitations and very different transport properties from the normal phase.\n\nIt is well known that at low temperature many metals become superconductors. A metal can be viewed as a Fermi liquid of electrons, and below a critical temperature, an attractive phonon-mediated interaction between the electrons near the Fermi surface causes them to pair up and form a condensate of Cooper pairs, which via the Anderson-Higgs mechanism makes the photon massive, leading to the characteristic behaviors of a superconductor; infinite conductivity and the exclusion of magnetic fields (Meissner effect). The crucial ingredients for this to occur are:\nThese ingredients are also present in sufficiently dense quark matter, leading physicists to expect that something similar will happen in that context:\n\nThe fact that a Cooper pair of quarks carries a net color charge, as well as a net electric charge, means that some of the gluons (which mediate the strong interaction just as photons mediate electromagnetism) become massive in a phase with a condensate of quark Cooper pairs, so such a phase is called a \"color superconductor\". Actually, in many color superconducting phases the photon itself does not become massive, but mixes with one of the gluons to yield a new massless \"rotated photon\". This is an MeV-scale echo of the mixing of the hypercharge and W bosons that originally yielded the photon at the TeV scale of electroweak symmetry breaking.\n\nUnlike an electrical superconductor, color-superconducting quark matter comes in many varieties, each of which is a separate phase of matter. This is because quarks, unlike electrons, come in many species. There are three different colors (red, green, blue) and in the core of a compact star we expect three different flavors (up, down, strange), making nine species in all. Thus in forming the Cooper pairs there is a 9×9 color-flavor matrix of possible pairing patterns. The differences between these patterns are very physically significant: different patterns break different symmetries of the underlying theory, leading to different excitation spectra and different transport properties.\n\nIt is very hard to predict which pairing patterns will be favored in nature. In principle this question could be decided by a QCD calculation, since QCD is the theory that fully describes the strong interaction. In the limit of infinite density, where the strong interaction becomes weak because of asymptotic freedom, controlled calculations can be performed, and it is known that the favored phase in three-flavor quark matter is the \"color-flavor-locked\" phase. But at the densities that exist in nature these calculations are unreliable, and the only known alternative is the brute-force computational approach of lattice QCD, which unfortunately has a technical difficulty (the \"sign problem\") that renders it useless for calculations at high quark density and low temperature.\n\nPhysicists are currently pursuing the following lines of research on color superconductivity:\n\nThe only known place in the universe where the baryon density might possibly be high enough to produce quark matter, and the temperature is low enough for color superconductivity to occur, is the core of a compact star (often called a \"neutron star\", a term which prejudges the question of its actual makeup). There are many open questions here:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32021039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32021039", "title": "Energy in Ukraine", "text": "Energy in Ukraine\n\nEnergy in Ukraine describes energy and electricity production, consumption and import in Ukraine. As an industry it is part of the Fuel and Energy Complex that combines smaller industries such as power generation and distribution, coal, oil and gas mining industries as well as transportation of resources. Ukraine's geographic position and proximity to Russia explain its importance as a natural gas and petroleum liquids transit country.\n\nApproximately 3.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas flowed through Ukraine in 2013 to Austria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Turkey.\n\nUkraine depends on Russia for its supplies of natural gas and oil (which are also produced domestically) while being a net-exporter of electricity and coal. Ukraine tries to diversify energy sources.\n\nUkraine was the 6th highest importer of natural gas in 2009.\n\nNaftogaz is the state owned gas company. Ukraine stopped buying gas from Russia in 2015 due to the Russian presence in eastern Ukraine. In disputes Russia has stopped gas delivery in 2006 and 2008. In 2009 80% of the European Union gas from Russia was delivered via Ukraine.\n\nIn 2014 total electricity production was 183 TWh, of which 8 TWh was exported to Europe; 88 TWh from nuclear, 71 TWh from coal, 13 TWh from natural gas, and 9 TWh from hydroelectricity. Electricity consumption was 134 TWh after transmission losses of 20 TWh, with peak demand at about 28 GWe. In 2015 electricity production fell to about 146 TWh largely due to a fall in anthracite coal supplies caused by the War in Donbass.\n\nElectricity production fell from 296 TWh in 1991 to 171 TWh in 1999, then increased slowly to 195 TWh in 2007, before falling again.\n\nIn 2017 Climate News Network reported that Chinese companies plan to spend $1bn in a solar power park in the nuclear disaster area in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine was 8th top nuclear electricity producer in 2009. 46.7% of domestic electricity generation was nuclear. This was the 2nd largest share, only France was higher. The largest nuclear power plant in Europe is in Ukraine.\n\nEnergoatom (National Nuclear Energy Generating Company of Ukraine) is the state nuclear company founded in 1996. It has about 38,000 employees.\n\nThe 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Northern Ukraine was the world's most severe nuclear accident.\n\nLack of coal for Ukraine's coal-fired power stations due to the War in Donbass and a shut down one of the six reactors of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant lead to rolling blackouts throughout Ukraine from early till late December 2014.\n\nIn 2018 Energoatom stated that electricity prices were too low to cover the cost of new nuclear fuel, and called for a price increase.\n\nUkraine signed a loan agreement in-principle for $3.65 billion with the China Development Bank in 2012, during President Viktor Yanukovich's term of office, contingent on the development of agreed development projects in the coal and gas sectors. However, by April 2017 Ukraine had not agreed any suitable projects due to a \"lack of convergence in the positions of [Uglesintezgaz] and the energy ministry\".\n\nCorruption is one of the top problems in Ukraine, characterised as a systemic phenomenon, which exists in all sections and levels of the public administration. Ukraine gets gas from Gazprom via third parties. Gazprom did not publish any reporting on anti-corruption programmes.\n\nIn 2015 corruption allegations were made against Energoatom, Ukraine's nuclear power operator, with concerns raised by Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. In March 2016, Energoatom's assets and bank accounts were frozen by Ukrainian courts over allegedly unpaid debts, against which Energoatom is appealing.\n"}
{"id": "46969864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46969864", "title": "Energy in the State of Palestine", "text": "Energy in the State of Palestine\n\nEnergy in the State of Palestine refers to energy and electricity consumption and production in the State of Palestine. The multi-source amount of electricity available in Palestine was 5,370 GW/hour in 2012 (3,700 in the West Bank and 1,670 in Gaza), while the annual per capita consumption of electricity (after deducting transmission loss) is 950 kilowatt/hour. National sources only produce 445 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, which meets less than 10 percent of demand. Palestinians do not produce oil or natural gas and are almost entirely dependent on the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) for electricity. The only domestic source of energy is the Gaza Marine gas field, which has not yet been developed. Palestinian energy demand had grown rapidly, increasing by 6.4% annually from 1999 to 2005. Future consumption of electricity in Palestine is expected to reach 8,400 gigawatts by 2020 as the consumption rate grows 6% annually.\n\nStructurally, Palestine does not have sufficient distribution companies or systems - a problem which leads to constraints on electricity efficiency. The West Bank and Gaza receive and consume energy in different ways.\n\nThe supply of petroleum is centrally located at two different terminals in the West Bank. These terminals have no capacity to keep petroleum and are therefore used daily. Electricity wise, the West Bank relies almost entirely on the IEC, with around 5% of the territory's electricity provided by Jordan to the Jericho governorate. As of 10 July 2017 there is a power substation operated by the Palestinian Electric Company located outside of Jenin capable of providing up to 135 MW purchased by the IEC to the northern West Bank area.\n\nAfter the 1967 occupation of the West Bank, agreements to distribute electricity to the West Bank from Jordan were terminated by the Israeli Military Governorate. Order 389 was issued in 1970 vesting the governance of the natural resources sector in an authority appointed by the military commander. Authority over the supply of electricity to the illegal settlement of Kiryat Arba was issued to the Israeli Civil Administration, which authorised the IEC to supply and sell electricity to the Hebron municipality. By 1980, a concession for all of the power supply in the West Bank was granted to the IEC.\n\nOn 23 February 2015 the IEC intentionally cut off the West Bank power for about 45 minutes due to uncollected debts. Two days later they again cut off power, stating it was a warning to the Palestinian Authority to begin paying down the debt, which at that time was NIS 1.9 billion. The majority of the debt is held by the PA and Jerusalem District Electricity Company (JDECO) which is a Palestinian electricity firm which buys its power from IEC and serves east Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Ramallah and Jericho areas. The IEC stated that they are losing NIS 85 million per month on power being supplied to Nablus and Jenin that they are not being paid for, causing the majority of their quarterly loss. The Palestinians accused IEC of collective punishment, however the IEC stated that they must operate independently and are treating this as they would any customer who does not pay their debts.\n\nOn 31 March 2016 the IEC once again cut power to parts of the West Bank, in the Jericho area, over a NIS 1.7 billion in debts. On 4 April the IEC cut power, in the Bethlehem area, and the following day the IEC cut power in the Hebron area. On 6 April, the IEC restored full power to the West Bank after they received a NIS 20 million payment, and an agreement to receive a full debt repayment schedule within seven days.\n\nThe supply of petroleum is centrally located at one terminal on the border of the Gaza strip. This terminal has no capacity to keep petroleum, which is therefore used daily. The Gaza Strip receives their electricity from the Israel Electric Corporation, a diesel power plant located in the Gaza strip and Egypt.\n\nFollowing the Hamas takeover of Gaza, development of the energy sector in Gaza largely stagnated, while facing increasing demand from population growth. During past military offensives, Israel has targeted vital energy infrastructure located in the occupied Gaza Strip.\n\nas of 2017, Gaza's normal energy needs are estimated to be approximately 400-600 megawatts for full 24-hour supply to all residents, which are normally \nsupplied by a diesel power plant in Gaza with has a nominal rating of 60-140 MW (figures vary due to degree of operation and damage to the plant) which is reliant on fuel imports, an additional 125 MW imported from Israel via 10 power lines, and 27 MW of power imported from Egypt. Even in normal conditions, the current rated supply of Gaza is inadequate to meet growing needs.\n\nThe Gaza electricity crisis is a result of the tensions between Hamas, who rules the Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian Authority/Fatah, who rules the West Bank over custom tax revenue, funding of the Gaza Strip, and political authority. Residents receive electricity for a few hours a day on a rolling blackout schedule. As a result of the crises the Gaza power plant has reduced and then ceased operations due to a lack of fuel, and the amount of imported electricity from Israel and Egypt has been reduced.\n"}

{"id": "37484118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37484118", "title": "ISO 20121", "text": "ISO 20121\n\nISO 20121 (full name: ISO 20121:2012, \"Event sustainability management systems –- Requirements with guidance for use\") is a voluntary international standard for sustainable event management, created by the International Organization for Standardization. The standard aims to help organizations improve sustainability throughout the entire event management cycle.\n\nEvery event – from a village barbecue to a major sporting event like the Olympics – will have economic, social and environmental impacts. Water and energy resources are put under pressure, significant amounts of waste and carbon emissions can be generated. Sometimes events can put a strain on local communities. By 2005, practitioners within the events industry were becoming aware of the need for more sustainable practices.\n\nSpecifically, the Head of Sustainability at the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, David Stubbs, was looking for a way to make good on the sustainability promises made in the London Games bid.\n\nHe raised the issue with the British Standards Institution (BSI) in the UK. This led to the creation of BS 8901:2007 \"Specification for a sustainable event management system with guidance for use\". After a period of review, the second version of BS 8901 was published in 2009.\n\nBS 8901 was received very positively by the international event industry, and was soon being widely used. For example, COP15, the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, was certified as compliant with BS 8901 in December 2009. The Microsoft Corporation achieved certification to BS 8901 at its Microsoft Convergence® 2009 event in New Orleans, Louisiana, in March 2009.\n\nResponding to this international enthusiasm for BS 8901, in May 2009 a proposal for an international sustainable event management standard was jointly submitted to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) by BSI Group and ABNT, the Brazilian national standards body.\n\nDelegations of experts of the national standards institutions of 25 countries developed the standard, with another 10 countries as observers. Eight stakeholder organizations from the event industry, or with a strong interest in sustainability, also participated. Members of the sustainability team of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games were among the stakeholders who provided input into the development of the standard.\nSubsequently, ISO 20121:2012 \"Event sustainability management systems –- Requirements with guidance for use\" was published in June 2012.\n\nISO 20121 is relevant to all members of the event industry supply chain including organizers, event managers, stand builders, caterers and logistics suppliers.\n\nThe standard takes a management systems approach to running more sustainable events. It provides a framework to help identify the potentially negative social, economic and environmental impacts of events. Organizers can then remove or reduce negative impacts through improved planning and processes.\n\nThis should lead to improvements in key sustainability issues such as venue selection, transport, recycling or reusing demolition waste, creating a sustainable food strategy, promoting healthy living and creating skills, employment and business legacies.\n\nThe standard can reduce costs, carbon emissions and waste; better manage the biodiversity of venues; and achieve a diverse and inclusive workforce.\n\nISO 20121 also includes practical guidance on communications, operational planning and control, stakeholder identification and engagement, supply chain management and procurement, and issue evaluation.\n\nISO 20121 is suitable for all sizes and types of events.\n\nOrganizations can demonstrate voluntary conformity with ISO 20121 by either: first party self-declaration; second party confirmation of conformance by parties having an interest in the organization, such as clients; or by certification by an independent third party, e.g. a certification body.\n\nHaving been highly influential in the creation of the standard, The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) and the Olympic Delivery Authority both successfully implemented ISO 20121 in June 2012.\nThe Head of Sustainability, David Stubbs, commented: \"London 2012 is proud to have been the catalyst for ISO 20121. This is a piece of legacy with the potential to transform how events around the world consider their economic, environmental and social impacts.\"\n\nSebastian Coe, Chair of LOCOG commented: “London 2012’s relentless pursuit of sustainability has been part of every bold and challenging decision we have made, in the development of the Olympic Park and the staging of the Games.”\n\nAnother early adopter of ISO 20121 was the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy (WPNSA) in the UK, which was the venue for the London 2012 sailing events.\n\nWPNSA reported that as a result of using the standard they achieved cost savings of around 15 per cent through better waste management and electricity optimization. They also enhanced their international reputation as a sports and corporate event venue, and reduced the risks of legislative breaches. Finally, they are demonstrably operating in accordance with the ‘One Planet Living’ principles of sustainable development, which as an organization they aspire to do.\n\nFollowing an extensive systems assessment, Plaza Athénée Bangkok A Royal Meridien Hotel became the first “ISO 20121 Event Sustainability Management System” hotel in the world. Since the implementation of the system in 2012, the hotel has reduced electricity consumption by 9.4%, water by 5.03%, and paper by 4.9% year-on-year. Carbon footprint profiling revealed a 47.05% reduction in printer ink consumption and a 25.0% l in plastic bottle use.\n\n\n"}

The Kraków Ghetto Jewish Police were a local force of the \"Jüdischer Ordnungsdienst,\" often abbreviated as OD. The OD were overseen by the Judenrat of each ghetto. The Kraków OD, unlike many other Jewish Police forces, served as willing enforcers of Nazi policies and the Gestapo. Among other duties, they oversaw the liquidation of the Kraków Ghetto and helped transport Jews to Bełżec extermination camp.\n\nSymcha Spira (also: Symche Spira, Symche Spiro, or Symche Shapiro) was the Chief of the Kraków OD. Unlike the Kraków Judenrat, the Kraków OD were extremely unpopular under Spira's leadership. In part because of Spira's sycophantic qualities, the Kraków OD collaborated with Nazi officials and local police to a greater degree than other ghettos. The Civil Division of the OD in particular worked closely with the Gestapo.\n\nSpira infamously spoke German and Polish poorly. Before the war, he worked as a glazier, making very little money. He was chosen for the position for his extreme loyalty to the Germans, as well as for his derision of his fellow Jews. Spira was known to wear outlandish, tailored uniforms while patrolling the ghetto. He beat and extorted the ghetto's inhabitants, becoming very wealthy under Nazi occupation.\n\nThe Kraków Ghetto OD was created in July 1940, with a force of around 40 men. This number quickly grew, and in December 1940, the force had expanded to an estimated 130 men. Members joined in the hope of being spared punishment from Nazi officials, as well as to leverage additional favors. Jews who had joined in the hopes of protecting their community, like some on the Judenrat, quickly resigned when faced with rampant corruption and violence within the force.\n\nThe creation of the OD was initially suggested as originating from the Judenrat, in the hope of presenting treatment of the ghetto inhabitants as a Jewish issue. Spira refused to follow the direction of the Judenrat, instead deferring to SS and Gestapo orders. Members of the Judenrat expressed frustration at the actions of the OD, claiming they did not have the interests of fellow Jews in mind.\n\nIn general, the duties of most Jewish Police forces revolved around the implementation of German orders. This involved keeping streets clear and addressing crime within the ghetto. Later, many Jewish Police forces would shift to assisting German authorities in rounding up Jews for labor, deportation, and extermination. The Kraków OD often went above and beyond German orders, defying the Judenrat, and arrested Jews who smuggled in food. Extortion, bribery, and physical violence were used by Jewish Police, who recovered food and smuggled items for their own families.\n\nThe Kraków OD were unsympathetic to resistance movements within the ghetto, and would arrest suspected members of the Polish Underground without hesitation. The Jewish Police also helped to track, arrest and kill partisans alongside the Gestapo. Underground movements constantly targeted OD members, who feared being accused of collaborating with resisters. The OD patrolled the ghetto carefully, searching for resistance hideouts, which they would then report to the German authorities. This participation made OD members the targets of retaliatory actions from both the Underground and German authorities.\n\nSymcha Spira took advantage of the German authorities' poor view of the Kraków Judenrat, and sought to convince Gestapo agents of his superior power and influence over fellow Jews. This included carrying out orders the Judenrat would not. He and other OD men passed bribes to the Gestapo, winning favors and privileges in return. The Gestapo promised OD members safety after the war's end, forging foreign papers for many of the men. Some of the OD men were also given visas for travel to other countries, which they attempted to use as conditions in the ghetto worsened.\n\nThe OD were also in charge of recording and preparing lists of Jews in the ghetto for deportation. They also assisted German and Polish police in rounding up Jews. The OD would enter houses and apartments at night, taking those selected for removal under cover of darkness. If Jews could not present a work permit or proof of employment, they were held in the courtyard of the OD building, which had formerly been a Catholic orphanage. The gathered Jews were transported the next morning by railroad car to Bełżec extermination camp.\n\nOne of the largest deportations of residents began on May 30, 1942 and lasted until June 8th. This was part of the larger Operation Reinhardt occurring across occupied Poland. Approximately 5,000 Jews without work permits or proper identification were taken via train to Belżec. During this \"aktion,\" members of the OD worked alongside German and Polish Blue Police, throwing away luggage, inspecting papers, and beating those who did not comply with orders.\n\nDuring subsequent deportations, the OD would occasionally intervene, bribing officials when family members or friends were selected for removal. Sometimes this was successful, but other times, even Spira's interventions could not spare everyone. In March 1943, the ghetto was completely liquidated. Those who remained were sent to Plaszów or Auschwitz, or were murdered on site.\n\nThe Kraków OD were initially exempted from deportation. After the liquidation of the ghetto, the Jewish Police assisted in cleanup and the processing of items left behind by those deported. They also assisted in moving bodies of those murdered in the ghetto. Many, including Spira, believed Nazi promises that they would be given their freedom and would be allowed to travel to America or another country after the war. Not long after the liquidation of the ghetto, the OD and all remaining Jews were deported to Płaszów and murdered.\n\n"}

Four ancient sources give lists of names of Oceanids. The oldest, and longest such list, given by the late 8th–early 7th century BC Greek poet Hesiod, names 41 Oceanids. Hesiod goes on to say that these \"are the eldest ... but there are many besides\" and that there were \"three thousand\" Oceanids, a number interpreted as meaning \"innumerable\". While some of these names, such as Peitho, Metis and Tyche, certainly reflected existing traditions, many were probably mere poetic inventions. The probably nearly as old \"Homeric Hymn to Demeter\" lists 21 names, 16 of which match those given by Hesiod, and were probably taken directly from there.\n\nThe roughly contemporary (? c. 1st century AD) Greek mythographer Apollodorus and the Latin mythographer Hyginus also give lists of Oceanids. Apollodorus gives a list containing 7 names, as well as mentioning 5 other Oceanids elsewhere. Of these 12 names, 8 match Hesiod. Hyginus, at the beginning of his \"Fabulae\", lists 16 names, while elsewhere he gives the names of 10 others. Of these 26 names, only 9 are found in Hesiod, the \"Homeric Hymn\", or Apollodorus. Many other names are given in other ancient sources.\n\nThe names of the Oceanids are of different types.\nThe Oceanids were the nymphs of springs, and some of the names apparently reflect this aquatic connection, with some perhaps being the names of actual springs. Other names have no apparent connection with water. Some, consistent with the Oceanids' function, as specified by Hesiod, of having \"youths in their keeping\" (i.e. being \"kourotrophoi\"), represent things which parents might hope to be bestowed upon their children: Plouto (\"Wealth\"), Tyche (\"Good Fortune\"), Idyia (\"Knowing\"), and Metis (\"Wisdom\"). Others appear to be geographical eponyms, such as Europa, Asia, Ephyra (Corinth), and Rhodos (Rhodes).\n\nSeveral of the names given for Ocheanids, are also names given for Nereids, the fifty sea nymphs who were the daughters of the sea god Nereus and the Oceanid Doris.\n\n"}

{"id": "7682366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7682366", "title": "Lunar soil", "text": "Lunar soil\n\nLunar soil is the fine fraction of the regolith found on the surface of the Moon. Its properties can differ significantly from those of terrestrial soil. The physical properties of lunar soil are primarily the result of mechanical disintegration of basaltic and anorthositic rock, caused by continuous meteoric impacts and bombardment by interstellar charged atomic particles over years. The process is largely one of mechanical weathering in which the particles are ground to finer and finer size over time. This situation contrasts fundamentally to terrestrial soil formation, mediated by the presence of molecular oxygen (O), humidity, atmospheric wind, and a robust array of contributing biological processes. Some have argued that the term \"soil\" is not correct in reference to the Moon because on Earth, soil is defined as having organic content, whereas the Moon has none. However, standard usage among lunar scientists is to ignore that distinction.\n\nThe term \"lunar soil\" is often used interchangeably with lunar regolith, but typically refers to only the finer fraction of regolith, that which is composed of grains 1 cm in diameter or less. Lunar dust generally connotes even finer materials than lunar soil. There is no official definition of what size fraction constitutes \"dust\"; some place the cutoff at less than 50 μm in diameter, while others at less than 10 μm.\n\nThe major processes involved in the formation of lunar soil are:\n\nThese processes not only form lunar soil, they also continue to change the physical and optical properties of the soil over time; this process is known as space weathering.\nIn addition, fire fountaining, whereby volcanic lava is lofted and cools into small glass beads before falling back to the surface, can create small but important deposits in some locations, such as the orange soil found at Shorty Crater in the Taurus-Littrow valley by Apollo 17, and the green glass found at Hadley-Apennine by Apollo 15. Deposits of volcanic beads are also thought to be the origin of Dark Mantle Deposits (DMD) in other locations around the Moon.\n\nLunar soil is composed of various types of particles including rock fragments, mono-mineralic fragments, and various kinds of glasses including agglutinate particles and volcanic and impact spherules. The agglutinates form at the lunar surface by micrometeorite impacts that cause small-scale melting which fuses adjacent materials together with tiny specks of metallic iron (Fe) embedded in each dust particle’s glassy shell.\n\nOver time, material is mixed both vertically and horizontally (a process known as \"gardening\") by impact processes. However, the contribution of material from great distances is relatively minor, such that the soil composition at any given location largely reflects the local bedrock composition.\n\nThere are two profound differences in the chemistry of lunar regolith and soil from terrestrial materials. The first is that the Moon is very dry. As a result, those minerals with water as part of their structure such as clay, mica, and amphiboles are totally absent from the Moon. The second difference is that lunar regolith and crust are chemically reduced, rather than being significantly oxidized like the Earth's crust. In the case of the regolith, this is due in part to the constant bombardment of the lunar surface with protons (i.e. hydrogen (H) nuclei) from the solar wind. One consequence is that iron on the Moon is found in the metallic 0 and +2 oxidation states, whereas on Earth iron is found primarily in the +2 and +3 oxidation states.\n\nThe significance of acquiring appropriate knowledge of lunar soil properties is great. The potential for construction of structures, ground transportation networks, and waste disposal systems, to name a few examples, will depend on real-world experimental data obtained from testing lunar soil samples. The load-carrying capability of the soil is an important parameter in the design of such structures on Earth.\n\nDue to myriad meteorite impacts (with velocities in the range of 20 km/s), the lunar surface is covered with a thin layer of dust. The dust is electrically charged and sticks to any surface it comes in contact with. The density of lunar regolith is about 1.5 g/cm. The soil becomes very dense beneath the top layer of regolith. \nOther factors which may affect the properties of lunar soil include large temperature differentials, the presence of a hard vacuum, and the absence of a significant lunar magnetic field (thereby allowing charged solar wind particles to continuously hit the surface of the Moon).\n\nThere is some evidence that the Moon may have a tenuous atmosphere of moving dust particles constantly leaping up from and falling back to the Moon's surface, giving rise to a \"dust atmosphere\" that looks static but is composed of dust particles in constant motion. The term \"Moon fountain\" has been used to describe this effect by analogy with the stream of molecules of water in a fountain following a ballistic trajectory while appearing static due to the constancy of the stream. According to a model proposed in 2005 by the Laboratory for Extraterrestrial Physics at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, this is caused by electrostatic levitation. On the daylit side of the Moon, solar ultraviolet and X-ray radiation is energetic enough to knock electrons out of atoms and molecules in the lunar soil. Positive charges build up until the tiniest particles of lunar dust (measuring 1 micrometre and smaller) are repelled from the surface and lofted anywhere from metres to kilometres high, with the smallest particles reaching the highest altitudes. Eventually they fall back toward the surface where the process is repeated. On the night side, the dust is negatively charged by electrons in the solar wind. Indeed, the fountain model suggests that the night side would achieve greater voltage differences than the day side, possibly launching dust particles to higher velocities and altitudes. This effect could be further enhanced during the portion of the Moon's orbit where it passes through Earth's magnetotail; see Magnetic field of the Moon for more detail. On the terminator there could be significant horizontal electric fields forming between the day and night areas, resulting in horizontal dust transport - a form of \"moon storm\".\n\nThis effect was anticipated in 1956 by science fiction author Hal Clement in his short story \"Dust Rag\", published in \"Astounding Science Fiction\".\n\nThere is some evidence for this effect. In the early 1960s, Surveyor 7 and several prior Surveyor spacecraft that soft-landed on the Moon returned photographs showing an unmistakable twilight glow low over the lunar horizon persisting after the Sun had set. Moreover, the distant horizon between land and sky did not look razor-sharp, as would have been expected in a vacuum where there was no atmospheric haze. Apollo 17 astronauts orbiting the Moon in 1972 repeatedly saw and sketched what they variously called \"bands,\" \"streamers\" or \"twilight rays\" for about 10 seconds before lunar sunrise or lunar sunset. Such rays were also reported by astronauts aboard Apollo 8, 10, and 15. These may have been similar to crepuscular rays on Earth.\n\nApollo 17 also placed an experiment on the Moon's surface called LEAM, short for Lunar Ejecta and Meteorites. It was designed to look for dust kicked up by small meteoroids hitting the Moon's surface. It had three sensors that could record the speed, energy, and direction of tiny particles: one each pointing up, east, and west. LEAM saw a large number of particles every morning, mostly coming from the east or west—rather than above or below—and mostly slower than speeds expected for lunar ejecta. In addition, the experiment's temperature increased to near 100 degrees Celsius a few hours after each lunar sunrise, so the unit had to be turned off temporarily because it was overheating. It is speculated that this could have been a result of electrically-charged moondust sticking to LEAM, darkening its surface so the experiment package absorbed rather than reflected sunlight. However, scientists were unable to make a definite determination of the source of the problem, as LEAM operated only briefly before the Apollo program ended.\n\nIt is possible that these storms have been spotted from Earth: For centuries, there have been reports of strange glowing lights on the Moon, known as \"Transient lunar phenomena\" or TLPs. Some TLPs have been observed as momentary flashes—now generally accepted to be visible evidence of meteoroids impacting the lunar surface. But others have appeared as amorphous reddish or whitish glows or even as dusky hazy regions that change shape or disappear over seconds or minutes. These may have been a result of sunlight reflecting from suspended lunar dust.\n\nA 2005 NASA study listed 20 risks that required further study before humans should commit to a human Mars expedition, and ranked \"dust\" as the #1 challenge. The report urged study of its mechanical properties, corrosiveness, grittiness, and effect on electrical systems. Most scientists think the only way to answer the questions definitively is by returning samples of Martian soil and rock to Earth well before launching any astronauts.\n\nAlthough that report addressed Martian dust, the concerns are equally valid concerning lunar dust. The dust found on the lunar surface could cause harmful effects on any manned outpost technology and crew members:\n\nThe principles of astronautical hygiene should be used to assess the risks of exposure to lunar dust during exploration on the Moon's surface and thereby determine the most appropriate measures to control exposure. These may include removing the spacesuit in a three-stage airlock, \"vacuuming\" the suit with a magnet before removal, and using local exhaust ventilation with a high–efficiency particulate filter to remove dust from the spacecraft's atmosphere.\n\nThe harmful properties of lunar dust are not well known. However, based on studies of dust found on Earth, it is expected that exposure to lunar dust will result in greater risks to health both from direct exposure (acute) and if exposure is over time (chronic). This is because lunar dust is more chemically reactive and has larger surface areas composed of sharper jagged edges than Earth dust. If the chemical reactive particles are deposited in the lungs, they may cause respiratory disease. Long-term exposure to the dust may cause a more serious respiratory disease similar to silicosis. During lunar exploration, the astronauts' spacesuits will become contaminated with lunar dust. The dust will be released into the atmosphere when the suits are removed. The methods used to mitigate exposure will include providing high air recirculation rates in the airlock, the use of a \"Double Shell Spacesuit\", the use of dust shields, the use of high–grade magnetic separation, and the use of solar flux to sinter and melt the regolith.\n\nThe Apollo astronauts brought back some 360 kilograms (800 pounds) of lunar rocks from six landing sites. Although this material has been isolated in vacuum-packed bottles, it is now unusable for detailed chemical or mechanical analysis—the gritty particles deteriorated the knife-edge indium seals of the vacuum bottles; air has slowly leaked in. Every sample brought back from the moon has been contaminated by Earth’s air and humidity. The dust has acquired a patina of rust, and, as a result of bonding with terrestrial water and oxygen molecules, its chemical reactivity is long gone. The chemical and electrostatic properties of the soil no longer match what future astronauts will encounter on the moon.\n\nMoon dust-contaminated items finally became available to the public in 2014, when the US government approved the sale of private material owned, and collected, by astronauts. Since then only one item has been produced for sale with genuine moon dust collected after the item spent over 32 hours on the Moon. A luggage strap, exposed to the elements of the Moon for 32 hours, a piece of Charles \"Pete\" Conrad's spacesuit on the Apollo 12 mission, was sold by his estate to a private purchaser at auction. In 2017 lunar soil collected by Neil Armstrong in 1969 was put up for auction. While many jewelry- and watch-makers claim their product contains \"moon dust\", the products only contain pieces of, or dust from, meteorites believed to have originated from the Moon.\n\n\n"}

The lake covers an area of , and has a depth of at its deepest point. It is both an important bird sanctuary and a popular bathing spot.\n\nMadum Lake most likely developed out of a glacial kettle hole – a hollow formed by the melting of glacial ice left by the Quaternary ice age. The lake formerly lay in heathland, but it is now located in Rebild Municipality, and is surrounded by the Rold Skov forest. To the north of the lake is a narrow forested belt, with birch as the dominant tree species. In the forest, common passerine birds dominate, along with buzzards, goshawks, sparrowhawks, long-eared owls, tawny owls, black woodpeckers, green woodpeckers and ravens. In winter months, whooper swans and merganser ducks can be seen around the lake.\n\nMadum Lake and the surrounding forest are partly owned by three private interests – Lindenborg Gods, Nørlund and Willestrup Estate – with 25% of the forest falling under state ownership. There is public access, and it is possible to walk around the lake on a marked route. Public fishing and boating on the lake is prohibited. At the lake's eastern shore is a visitor parking space, from which extends a marked route to and around the Long Marsh – a large, well-preserved bog in the forest to the east.\n\nMadum Lake is part of a Natura 2000 protected area (no. 18) that also includes the forest of Rold Skov and the river valley of Lindenborg Ådal. The protected area covers a total of , and is also protected under the EU Habitats Directive as a bird sanctuary.\n\nMadum Lake is a bird sanctuary of international importance, and is designated as area F3 under the EU Habitats Directive. It serves as a stopover for goldeneye and tufted ducks, and to a lesser extent, mallards. In the spring and autumn, ospreys forage on the lake's population of pike and perch. Madum Lake furthermore serves as an important breeding site for birds, hosting the nests of great crested grebes, mute swans and coots.\n\nMadum Lake has been declared a \"Lobelia-lake\", after the plant \"Lobelia dortmanna\", indicating very high water quality. However, there is evidence that, in recent years, the ecosystem of the lake has been stressed by outside pollution, including airborne nitrogen from agricultural activities and the more direct influence of hundreds of bathers in summer. A clear sign of this stress is seen in late summer in the form of algal blooms, and the lake's reed-covered headlands have widened in recent years. The lake's waters reportedly remain very clear, but are increasingly acidic and nutrient-poor.\n\n"}

MSM was formed through the collaborative efforts of the London Homeopathic Hospital and the British Homeopathic Association in 1903. \nWhile class size was always relatively small, the 1990s showed particularly small class size. This spurred the Missionary School of Medicine to be renamed Medical Service Ministries in 1992. The implications behind the word “missionary” were thought to be driving students away. However, the increasing cost of running the school coupled with the demands brought on by qualifications required by many developing countries at this time caused MSM to close the school portion of the organization (1996) in order to become strictly a trust fund for funding applicants supported by Christian communities/organizations.\n\nDuring the 19th century, many missionaries sought to expand trade and spread the Christian gospel in the developing British colonies. However, many found that they were ill-equipped in the tropical climate; many missionaries and their families became ill. Due to this lack of medical knowledge, many missionaries returned to England to receive first aid training at the end of the 19th century.\nAs a supporter of the newly formed British Homeopathic Association, the London Homeopathic Hospital was one such place that offered to train missionaries in first aid. The British Homeopathic Association’s Educational Committee ran these trainings in partnership with the London Homeopathic Hospital. Lectures were offered in both basic medicine and surgery.\nFinding increased interest from returning missionaries, in the autumn of 1903, the Missionary School of Medicine was opened at the London Homeopathic Hospital to accommodate the training. Upon its opening, Dr. Edwin A. Neatby became the first Dean of the Missionary School of Medicine, presiding over the 24 students enrolled in the school’s first class.\n\nThe Missionary School of Medicine was organized with a President, and a general council. There were additionally a treasurer and a warden, responsible for both running the school day-to-day and teaching nursing procedures,\n\nPresidents of the school include Edwin A. Neatby (beginning in 1903), H. Dodd (beginning in 1952), and Kathleen Priestman (serving from 1981-1991).\n\nJohn Weir was a notable treasurer for the Missionary School of Medicine due to his contributions to the formation of the school’s endowment fund. Wardens that served at the school include:\n\nThe teaching staff included homeopathic physicians experienced in tropical medicine and other specialties. M Some of the teaching staff and their subjects include:\n\nThe teaching program was delivered over the course of three terms. Early course offerings included lectures in basic medicine and surgery, and later expanded to the other medical areas, as well as to Homeopathic pharmacy\nThe goal of the curriculum was to enable missionaries to care for themselves, their families, and others when abroad and when there was no additional medical aid available.\n\nLectures were held at The Wellcome Museum as well as at the London Homeopathic Hospital. The London Homeopathic Hospital also allowed students at their clinics and to study there. Further, St. John’s Ambulance Association taught first aid at the school.\n\nUpon graduation from the school, graduates received both homeopathic remedies and certificates. The remedies were donated by homeopathic pharmacies that were involved in teaching at the school, and were given to the graduates to take with them on their missions.\n\nIn the early 1900s, the “Scholarship Fund” was formed by Reverend Omri Jenkins. It was hoped that an endowment fund could be created from this to cover costs of running the school. The treasurer was responsible for overseeing this fund. Treasurer John Weir was particularly successful in gathering donations for the fund, attracting funds through private connections.\n\nIn addition to these funds, student fees were used to help cover the cost of running the school. Since student fees were kept low, they never could fully cover the cost of running the school. Here is a progression of the student fees at the school:\n\nMost students were sponsored by the Missionary Societies that sent them abroad. MSM students were supported by 115 different Societies.\n\nMany different countries were represented in MSM. From the 1960s to the 1970s, students came from England, Japan, Norway, Germany, and Korea. In the 1980s, students also came from Angola, the Netherlands, Indonesia, South America, Finland, India, Kenya, Spain, Sri Lanka, and Switzerland.\n\nIn the first 50 years of the school, class sizes ranged from 20-30 students. In later years, class sizes were much less, averaging to about 10 students or less per class.\n\nUpon graduating from the school, many graduates went abroad to serve in places including Africa, Japan, South America, India, and Iceland. Supported by home churches and mission organizations, many graduates set up clinics in the places where they served. Often, the clinics and Mission hospitals in which MSM graduates worked formed the basic network for the development of healthcare in many countries.\n\n\"Main articles: Homeopathy\n\nHomeopathy and natural medicine were the focus of the studies of the students at MSM.\n\nTwo main principles guide the use of medicine in homeopathy: the Similia Principle and the Dose. The Similia Principle states that a substance that can cause a symptom complex in a healthy person can be used to treat similar symptoms in a sick person. The Dose states that the quantity of medicine used should be the smallest possible to affect a cure and should not be repeated as long as improvement lasts. \nIn addition, MSM focused on the use of natural medicine. Natural medicine seeks to combine the advantages of both traditional and modern medicine. Traditional medicine refers to the use of knowledge of the use of locally grown plants coupled with an understanding of the language and culture of local villages. Modern medicine refers to the use of drugs that are regulated and produced to a high standard. Through combining these two types of medicine, natural medicine seeks to develop a new culturally appropriate and cost effective health service.\n\nIn 1925, the London Homeopathic Hospital found that it needed the study room it lent to MSM as a place for it to train its own nurses. As a result, the school moved from London Homeopathic Hospital to 2 Powis Place, where it remained until it closed in 1996.\n\nIn 1936, John Weir (treasurer), stated the aims of the Missionary School of Medicine:\n\nWhile class size was always relatively small, the 1990s showed particularly small class size. Leaders in the school assumed that lack of interest could be attributed to the implications of the word “missionary” in modern day culture. As a result, the Missionary School of Medicine was renamed Medical Service Ministries in 1992. One goal of the renaming was to attract more students to take their 10-week summer courses. However, as class size did not show a significant improvement, the school closed in 1996.\n\nThe 1990s showed a major development in the health ministries of emerging nations, like Africa. As a result, these developing nations requested that those offering medical treatment have required registered qualifications. In order to provide academically recognized qualifications, Medical Service Ministries found that it would have to merge with a university. However, since class sizes were so small and the cost to run the school was only increasing, Medical Service Ministries decided to discontinue training in 1996.\n\nWhen the school closed, investment income was transferred to the Scholarship Fund, reducing administration costs. As a result, with the work of the Administrator of Trust, Mrs. Glennis Powling, Medical Service Ministries was able to make its financial resources available to fund applicants traveling elsewhere.\n\nAs a grant-making trust, Medical Service Ministries provides grants to candidates undertaking specialist training in these areas:\n\nIn addition, MSM generally considers funding applicants who are primary healthcare trainers or workers in impoverished areas of underdeveloped countries. Further, applicants must show evidence of sponsorship or support of a Christian mission or local community.\n\nOne example of a trust fund applicant success story can be found in Tamara Filmer, a missionary working in rural, undeveloped Nepal. Filmer writes:\n\n\"“With MSM’s assistance I was able to attend training in logistics and management regarding pharmaceuticals. In December 2012, I travelled from the mid-west of Nepal to India’s capital, Delhi, to attend a two-week course entitled “International Procurement and Supply Chain Management”. I walked away with a suitcase of information and resources! ... I want to thank Medical Service Ministries and their supporters for the funding that enabled me to attend this course. On our missionary living allowance, it just wouldn’t have been possible to afford the course, so I am grateful for this opportunity.”\"\n\nThe current mission statement of Medical Service Ministries is as follows:\n\n\"“To encourage full-time Christian workers in the UK and elsewhere to prepare for Personal and Community Healthcare work in the developing world, in association with Christian organizations, and to witness to their faith in obedience to Christ’s command to preach and heal.

However, some succeeded at lying about their age. The youngest member of the United States military was 12-year-old Calvin Graham. He lied about his age when he enlisted in the US Navy, and his real age was not known until after he was wounded. The United States military was not the sole recruiter, albeit unintentionally or intentionally, of underage child soldiers during World War II.\n\nThe legality relating to the use of children in armed conflicts, as soldiers or in other capacities, has changed significantly in the last century. During both world wars, the legal framework was under-developed. Following World War I, in 1924 the League of Nations adopted the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child. Despite this attempt to protect children's rights, stating they must be \"protected against every form of exploitation,\" the rise of fascism that led to the start of World War II left millions of children again unprotected – gassed, killed or orphaned.\n\nThe lack of legal protection for children in times of war, which allows for their exploitation, can be linked to the lack of a universally recognised definition of a child during World War II.\n\nPrior to the creation of the United Nations during World War II, protection of child welfare was predominantly embodied in the laws of war, jus in bello. These laws sought to outlaw war.\n\nIn relation to protecting the rights of children involved in conflict, however, this concept failed to address the concept of a child-soldier at the time of World War II.\n\nFurthermore, there was essentially no criminal culpability placed on the child where a breach of jus in bello occurred. No legal limits excluded children being involved in armed conflicts, nor was there any definition of what a child was in relation to their ability to be involved in conflicts.\n\nHitler Youth (\"Hitlerjugend\") was established as an organization in Nazi Germany that physically trained youth and indoctrinated them with Nazi ideology to the point of fanaticism. Even at the onset of war, Hitler Youth totalled 8.8 million members. Numbers decreased significantly (to just over one million) once the war began as many local and district leaders were drafted for the national army. Previous average age for local and district leaders was 24, but following the onset of war, this had to change to those who were 16 and 17 years of age. These youths were in command of up to 500 boys.\n\nOne Hitler Youth soldier, Heinz Shuetze aged 15 from Leipzig, was only given a half-day of training with a primitive form of tank-killing rocket. He was immediately given an SS uniform and directed to the front lines to fight.\n\nHuge numbers of youths were removed from school in early 1945, and sent on, essentially, suicide missions. Hitler Youth activities often included learning to throw grenades, dig trenches, bayonet drills and escaping under barbed wire under pistol fire and, while doing so boys were encouraged to find these activities exhilarating and exciting. Hitler Youth was essentially an army of fit, young Germans that Hitler had created, trained to fight for their country. They had the choice to either follow Nazi party orders or face trial with the possibility of execution.\n\nThe boys of Hitler Youth first saw action following the British Air Raids in Berlin in 1940. Later, in 1942, the Wehrertüchtigungslager or WELS (Defense Strengthening Camps) were created in Germany, which were designed to train Hitler Youth boys aged 16–18. They learnt how to handle German infantry weaponry, including hand grenades, machine guns and hand pistols. By 1943, Hitler Youth boys were facing the forces of Britain, the United States and Soviet Russia.\n\nEven younger boys from the ages of 10–14 years could be involved in the Hitler Youth movement, under the Deutsches Jungvolk.\n\nGirls were also involved in Hitler Youth Operations, although in a limited capacity, through the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM, the League of German Girls). Avoiding direct armed conflict, their primary role was to produce healthy, racially pure baby boys. They were also required to run 60 metres in 14 seconds, throw a ball at least 12 metres, march for 2 hours and swim 100 metres.\n\nTowards the end of the War, the Germans established an entire SS Panzer Tank Division with the majority of its recruits being 16 and 17-year-old boys from the Hitler Youth brigades. In the 1st Battalion over 65% were under 18 years old, and only 3% were over 25. There were more than 10,000 boys in this division.\n\nThe 12th SS Panzer Division of the Hitlerjugend, was established later in World War II as Germany suffered more casualties, and more young people volunteered, initially as reserves, but soon joined front line troops. These children saw extensive action and were among the fiercest and most effective German defenders in the Battle of Berlin. In the battle of the Normandy beaches, the division had suffered 60% casualties, most of whom were teenagers.\n\nThese fearsome young boy soldiers acquired a formidable reputation for their violent and unforgiving practice, shooting prisoners, and were responsible for 64 deaths of British and Canadian soldiers between 7–16 June 1944.\n\nIn late 1944, the People's Army was formed (\"Volkssturm\") in anticipation of an Allied invasion. Men of all ages, from 16–60 were conscripted into this army.\n\nChildren as young as 8 were reported as having been captured by American troops, with boys aged 12 and under manning artillery units. Even girls were being placed in armed combat, operating anti-aircraft, or \"flak\", guns alongside boys. Children commonly served in auxiliary roles in the \"Luftwaffe\" and were known as \"flakhelfer\", from \"luftwaffenhelfer\". \n\nDuring the Holocaust, Jews of all ages participated in the Jewish resistance simply to survive. Most Jewish Resistance took place after 1942 when the Nazi atrocities became clear. Many Polish political leaders fled Warsaw at the onset of war, and those who remained were generally executed, jailed or forced to serve on the Jewish Council (\"Judenrat\").\n\nLeaders of the Zionist Youth Movement who fled returned to Warsaw through a sense of responsibility as local leaders, for both youth in general and the wider Jewish community. More than 100,000 young Jews participated in resistance youth movements, despite the Germans outlawing such activity.\n\nThe Zionist groups' focus changed with the onset of war. Before the war, they focused on social and ideological development. Feeling a higher sense of responsibility to their people during the war, they set out to educate their people by setting up underground schools in ghettos.\n\nThese leaders led a ghetto resistance, determining political and social action underground. Youth of the Zionist resistance were part of the Armee Juive (\"Jewish Army\") in France, created in 1942, an armed Jewish resistance in Western Europe. They took part in the 1944 uprisings against the Germans in Paris.\n\nMany members of the youth movement Hashomer Hatzair fought in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943. The participation of children in this armed resistance is usually regarded as nothing short of heroic.\n\nA number of child soldiers served in the Soviet Union's armed forces during World War II. In some cases, orphans also unofficially joined the Soviet Red Army. Such children were affectionately known as \"son of the regiment\" (Russian: сын полка) and sometimes willingly performed military missions such as reconnaissance. Officially, the age of military conscription was lowered to 18 for those without secondary education and 19 for those who had been educated beyond that.\nIn 1943 and 1944 16-17 years old teenagers (born 1926-7), many of Middle Asia, were drafted. These soldiers served in secondary units, not combat. Many were sent to the Far East, to replace units sent to the German front. After training and coming of age, the youth were sent too.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, boys of 17 were accepted into the Home Guard when it was formed in 1940 in preparation for a German invasion and as a \"last line of defence\". On 27 September 1942, the minimum age was lowered to 16 provided there was parental consent. They were nicknamed \"Dad's Army\". The Secretary of State for War, Anthony Eden, called for men between the ages of 17 and 65 for Home Guard duty, so it was voluntarily undertaken by those of the younger age. Initially a rag-tag militia, the Home Guard and its young volunteers became well-equipped and well-trained. More than 1,200 Home Guard men died from German bombings.\n\nIn anticipation of the possible Allied invasion of Japan, Japanese military authorities also trained young teenagers to fight the enemy with bamboo spears and other (often poorly) improvised weapons. Some Japanese children aged 17 years volunteered to be Kamikaze suicide pilots.\n\nPrior to that, Japanese school children experienced increased military training introduced through their physical education classes, with military drills becoming a staple part of their curriculum.\n\nThe Japanese Imperial Army mobilized students aged 14–17 years in Okinawa island for the Battle of Okinawa. This mobilization was conducted by the ordinance of the Ministry of Army, not by law. The ordinances mobilized the student for a volunteer soldier for form's sake. However, in reality, the military authorities ordered schools to force almost all students to \"volunteer\" for soldiers. Sometimes they counterfeited the necessary documents of students. And student soldiers \"Tekketsu Kinnotai\" were killed such as in suicide attacks against a tank with bombs and in guerrilla operations.\n\nAfter losing in the Battle of Okinawa in June 1945, the Japanese government enacted new laws in preparation for the decisive battles in the main islands. They were the laws that made it possible boys aged 15 or older and girls aged 17 or older to be drafted into the army for actual battles. Those who escape the draft were punished by imprisonment.\n\nThe Japanese surrender, however, had forestalled the Allied invasion of the Japanese main islands, and therefore rendered these child soldiers unnecessary.\n\nThe introduction of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of a Child in 1989 was the first time that any formal commitment was entered into that specified, protected and realised the human rights of a child. This Convention sets out the civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children.\n\nLack of definition of 'child' and lack of protecting a child from exploitation in times of war allowed for children to be used as soldiers and in other war related activities in World War II. \nCurrently, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) defines a child soldier as \"any child – boy or girl – under eighteen years of age, who is part of any kind of regular or irregular armed force or armed group in any capacity\". This age limit of 18 is relatively new, only introduced in 2002 under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Prior to 2002, the 1949 Geneva Convention and the 1977 Additional Protocols, set 15 as the minimum age to participate in armed conflict.\n\nIt is a contentious issue whether children should be able to be prosecuted for committing war crimes.\n\nFollowing the creation of the United Nations in 1945, and subsequent international conventions, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, child rights have been notably asserted and protected. Immediately following World War II, children involved in armed conflict were not able to be prosecuted, as the legislative instruments did not exist to do so. Currently, international law does not prohibit children in being prosecuted for war crimes they committed, although article 37 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of a Child does limit the punishment a child can receive. This includes \"neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age\".\n\nUnder Article 8(2)(b)(xxvi) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which was adopted in 1998, and came into force in 2002, \"Conscripting or enlisting children under the age of fifteen years into the national armed forces or using them to participate actively in hostilities\" is a war crime.\n\nUnder the Paris Principles and Guidelines on Children Associated with Armed Forces or armed groups, those children accused of war crimes, should primarily be treated as victims and treated in accordance with international law under restorative justice, rehabilitation that is consistent child protection treaties and principles.\n\nThere were some cases from World War II, where children were prosecuted of war crimes for actions undertaken during the war. Two 15-year-old ex-Hitler Youth were convicted of violating laws of war, by being party to a shooting of a prisoner of war. The youths' age was a mitigating factor in their sentencing.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2885328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2885328", "title": "Oligotroph", "text": "Oligotroph\n\nAn oligotroph is an organism that can live in an environment that offers very low levels of nutrients. They may be contrasted with copiotrophs, which prefer nutritionally rich environments. Oligotrophs are characterized by slow growth, low rates of metabolism, and generally low population density.\n\nThe adjective \"oligotrophic\" may be used to refer to environments that offer little to sustain life, organisms that survive in such environments, or the adaptations that support survival. Etymologically, the word \"oligotroph\" is a combination of the Greek adjective \"oligos\" (ὀλίγος) meaning \"few\" and the adjective \"trophikos\" (τροφικός)) meaning \"feeding\".\n\nOligotrophic environments include deep oceanic sediments, caves, glacial and polar ice, deep subsurface soil, aquifers, ocean waters, and leached soils.\n\nExamples of oligotrophic organisms are the cave-dwelling olm; the bacterium, \"Pelagibacter ubique\", which is the most abundant organism in the oceans with an estimated 2 × 10 individuals in total; and the lichens with their extremely low metabolic rate.\n\nPlant adaptations to oligotrophic soils provide for greater and more efficient nutrient uptake, reduced nutrient consumption, and efficient nutrient storage. Improvements in nutrient uptake are facilitated by root adaptations such as nitrogen-fixing root nodules, mycorrhizae and cluster roots. Consumption is reduced by very slow growth rates, and by efficient use of low-availability nutrients; for example, the use of highly available ions to maintain turgor pressure, with low-availability nutrients reserved for the building of tissues. Despite these adaptations, nutrient requirement typically exceed uptake during the growing season, so many oligotrophic plants have the ability to store nutrients, for example, in trunk tissues, when demand is low, and remobilise them when demand increases.\n\nOligotrophs occupy environments where the available nutrients offer little to sustain life. The term “oligotrophic” is commonly used to describe terrestrial and aquatic environments with very low concentrations of nitrates, iron, phosphates, and carbon sources.\n\nOligotrophs have acquired survival mechanisms that involve the expression of genes during periods of low nutrient conditions, which has allowed them to find success in various environments. Despite the capability to live in low nutrient concentrations, oligotrophs may find difficulty surviving in nutrient-rich environments.\n\nAntarctic life offers very little to sustain life as most organisms are not well adapted to live under nutrient-limiting conditions and cold temperatures (lower than 5 °C). As such, these environments display a large abundance of psychrophiles that are well adapted to living in an Antarctic biome. Most oligotrophs live in lakes where water helps support biochemical processes for growth and survival. Below are some documented examples of oligotrophic environments in Antarctica:\n\nLake Vostok, a freshwater lake which has been isolated from the world beneath 4 km (2.5 mi) of Antarctic ice is frequently held to be a primary example of an oligotrophic environment. Analysis of ice samples showed ecologically separated microenvironments. Isolation of microorganisms from each microenvironment led to the discovery of a wide range of different microorganisms present within the ice sheet. Traces of fungi have also been observed which suggests potential for unique symbiotic interactions. The lake’s extensive oligotrophy has led some to believe parts of lake are completely sterile. This lake is a helpful tool for simulating studies regarding extraterrestrial life on frozen planets and other celestial bodies.\n\nCrooked Lake is an ultra-oligotrophic glacial lake with a thin distribution of heterotrophic and autotrophic microorganisms. The microbial loop plays a big role in cycling nutrients and energy within this lake, despite particularly low bacterial abundance and productivity in these environments. The little ecological diversity can be attributed to the lake's low annual temperatures. Species discovered in this lake include \"Ochromonas, Chlamydomonas, Scourfeldia, Cryptomonas, Akistrodesmus falcatus,\" and \"Daphniopsis studeri\" (a microcrustacean). It is proposed that low competitive selection against \"Daphniopsis studeri\" has allowed the species to survive long enough to reproduce in nutrient limiting environments.\n\nThe sandplains and lateritic soils of southern Western Australia, where an extremely thick craton has precluded any geological activity since the Cambrian and there has been no glaciation to renew soils since the Carboniferous. Thus, soils are extremely nutrient-poor and most vegetation must use strategies such as cluster roots to gain even the smallest quantities of such nutrients as phosphorus and sulfur.\n\nThe vegetation in these regions, however, is remarkable for its biodiversity, which in places is as great as that of a tropical rainforest and produces some of the most spectacular wildflowers in the world. It is however, severely threatened by climate change which has moved the winter rain belt south, and also by clearing for agriculture and through use of fertilizers, which is primarily driven by low land costs which make farming economic even with yields a fraction of those in Europe or North America.\n\nAn example of oligotrophic soils are those on white-sands, with soil pH lower than 5.0, on the Rio Negro basin on northern Amazonia that house very low-diversity, extremely fragile forests and savannahs drained by blackwater rivers; dark water colour due to high concentration of tannins, humic acids and other organic compounds derived from the very slow decomposition of plant matter. Similar forests are found in the oligotrophic waters of the Patía River delta on the Pacific side of the Andes.\n\nIn the ocean, the subtropical gyres north and south of the equator are regions in which the nutrients required for phytoplankton growth (for instance, nitrate, phosphate and silicic acid) are strongly depleted all year round. These areas are described as oligotrophic and exhibit low surface chlorophyll. They are occasionally described as \"ocean deserts\".\n\nThe oligotrophic soil environments include agricultural soil, frozen soil etc. Various factors, such as decomposition, soil structure, fertilization and temperature, can affect the nutrient-availability in the soil environments.\n\nGenerally, the nutrient becomes less available along the depth of the soil environment, because on the surface, the organic compounds decomposed from the plant and animal debris are consumed quickly by other microbes, resulting in the lack of nutrient in the deeper level of soil. In addition, the metabolic waste produced by the microorganisms on the surface also causes the accumulation of toxic chemicals in the deeper area. Furthermore, oxygen and water are important for some metabolic pathways, but it is difficult for water and oxygen to diffuse as the depth increases. Some factors, such as soil aggregates, pores and extracellular enzymes, may help water, oxygen and other nutrients diffuse into the soil. Moreover, the presence of mineral under the soil provides the alternative sources for the species living in the oligotrophic soil. In terms of the agricultural lands, the application of fertilizer has a complicated impact on the source of carbon, either increasing or decreasing the organic carbon in the soil.\n\n\"Collimonas\" is one of the species that are capable of living in the oligotrophic soil. One common feature of the environments where \"Collimonas\" lives is the presence of fungi, because \"Collimonas\" have the ability of not only hydrolyzing the chitin produced by fungi for nutrients, but also producing materials (e.g., \"P. fluorescens\" 2-79) to protect themselves from fungal infection. The mutual relationship is common in the oligotrophic environments. Additionally, \"Collimonas\" can also obtain electron sources from rocks and minerals by weathering. \n\nIn terms of polar areas, such as Antarctic and Arctic region, the soil environment is considered as oligotrophic because the soil is frozen with low biological activities. The most abundant species in the frozen soil are Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Cyanobacteria, together with a small amount of archaea and fungi. Actinobacteria can maintain the activity of their metabolic enzymes and continue their biochemical reactions under a wide range of low temperature. In addition, the DNA repairing machinery in Actinobacteria protects them from lethal DNA mutation at low temperature.\n\n\n"}

It was developed by the Brazilian engineer Otto Pfafstetter in 1989. It is designed such that topological information is embedded in the code, which makes it easy to determine whether an event in one river basin will affect another by direct examination of their codes.\n\nIn the 1950s, Pfafstetter suggested the use of a hierarchical system of coding river basins, later described in a 1989 paper. The method was applied to Brazilian water networks, and has been used in a number of other applications.\n\nThe Pfafstetter system relies on the properties of the base-10 numbering system. In a water system to be coded, the main stem is defined as the path which drains the greatest area. The four major tributaries, in terms of water drainage, of the main stem are determined, and the water basin of each defined. This results in four tributary basins, as well as five inter-basin regions which are drained by the main stem.\n\nEach region is then numbered from 1-9, with the downstream-most inter-basin region denoted 1; therefore, the inter-basin regions and tributary basins are numbered 1,3,5,7,9 and 2,4,6,8 respectively. The number 0 is reserved for closed drainage systems.\n\nEach tributary basin is then coded in an identical manner, and the resulting number appended to the end of the tributary basin number. In this manner, the entire waterway may be coded in a recursive manner to an arbitrary precision.\n\nThe primary advantage of the Pfafstetter system is that the water drainage topology is directly described by the code:\n\n\nTherefore, given a point with code \"A\" on the water system, a point with code \"B\" is downstream if:\n\nFor example, segment 8835 is upstream of segments 8833 and 8811, but not segments 8832, 8821 or 9135.\n\nThe Pfaffstetter system is a particularly efficient system; \"n\"-digit codes can be used in a water system with 10 segments. It compares favourably in this respect to the USGS HUC method.\n\n"}
{"id": "22657974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22657974", "title": "Power usage effectiveness", "text": "Power usage effectiveness\n\nPower usage effectiveness (PUE) is a ratio that describes how efficiently a computer data center uses energy; specifically, how much energy is used by the computing equipment (in contrast to cooling and other overhead).\n\nPUE is the ratio of total amount of energy used by a computer data center facility to the energy delivered to computing equipment. PUE is the inverse of data center infrastructure efficiency (DCIE). \n\nPUE was originally developed by a consortium called The Green Grid. \nPUE was published in 2016 as a global standard under ISO/IEC 30134-2:2016 \n\nAn ideal PUE is 1.0. Anything that isn't considered a computing device in a data center (i.e. lighting, cooling, etc.) falls into the category of facility energy consumption.\n\nThe PUE metric is the most popular method of calculating energy efficiency. Although it is the most effective in comparison to other metrics, the Power Usage Effectiveness comes with its share of flaws. This is the most frequently used metric for operators, facility technicians, and building architects to determine how energy efficient their data center buildings are. Some professionals even brag about their Power Usage Effectiveness being lower than others. Naturally, it is not a surprise that in some cases an operator may “accidentally” not count the energy used for lighting, resulting in lower Power Usage Effectiveness. This problem is more linked to a human mistake, rather than an issue with the Power Usage Effectiveness metric system itself.\n\nOne real problem is PUE does not account for the climate within the cities the data centers are built. In particular, it does not account for different normal temperatures outside the data center. For example, a data center located in Alaska cannot be effectively compared to a data center in Miami. A colder climate results in a lesser need for a massive cooling system. Cooling systems account for roughly 30 percent of consumed energy in a facility, while the data center equipment accounts for nearly 50 percent. Due to this, the Miami data center may have a final Power Usage Effectiveness of 1.8 and the data center in Alaska may have a ratio of 1.7, but the Miami data center may be running overall more efficiently. In particular, if it happened to be in Alaska, it may get a better result.\n\nAdditionally, according to a case study on Science Direct, \"an estimated PUE is practically meaningless unless the IT is working at full capacity\".\n\nAll in all, finding simple, yet recurring issues such as the problems associated with the effect of varying temperatures in cities and learning how to properly calculate all the facility energy consumption is very essential. By doing so, continuing to reduce these problems ensures that further progress and higher standards are always being pushed to improve the success of the Power Usage Effectiveness for future data center facilities.\n\nPUE was introduced in 2006 and promoted by the Green Grid (a non-profit organization of IT professionals) in 2007, and has become the most commonly used metric for reporting the energy efficiency of data centres. Although it is named 'power usage effectiveness', it actually measures the energy use of the data centre.\n\nThe PUE metric has several important benefits. First, the calculation can be repeated over time, allowing a company to view their efficiency changes historically, or during time-limited events like seasonal changes. Second, companies can gauge how more efficient practices (such as powering down idle hardware) affect their overall usage. Finally, the PUE metric creates competition, “driving efficiencies up as advertised PUE values become lower\". Companies can then use PUE as a marketing tool.\n\nHowever, there are some issues with the PUE metric. Rather than the issues mentioned in last paragraph, some other issues are the efficiency of the power supply network and calculating the accurate IT load. According to the sensitivity analysis by Gemma, \"Total energy consumption is equal to the total amount of energy used by the equipment and infrastructure in the facility (WT) plus the energy losses due to inefficiencies in the power delivery network (WL), hence: PUE=(WT+WL)/WIT.\" Based on the equation, the inefficiencies of the power delivery network (WL) will increase the total energy consumption of the data center. The PUE value goes up as the data center becomes less efficient. IT load is another important issue of the PUE metric. \"It is crucial that an accurate IT load is used for the PUE, and that it is not based upon the rated power use of the equipment. Accuracy in the IT load is one of the major factors affecting the measurement of the PUE metric, as utilization of the servers has an important effect on IT energy consumption and hence the overall PUE value\". For example, a data center with high PUE value and high server utilization could be more efficient than a data center with low PUE value and low server utilization. There is also some concern within the industry of PUE as a marketing tool leading some to use the term 'PUE Abuse'.\n\nIn October 2008, Google's Data center was noted to have a ratio of 1.21 PUE across all 6 of its centers, which at the time was considered as close to perfect as possible. Right behind Google, was Microsoft, which had another notable PUE ratio of 1.22 \n\nSince 2015, Switch, the developer of SUPERNAP data centers, has had a third-party audited colocation PUE of 1.18 for its SUPERNAP 7 Las Vegas Nevada facility, with an average cold aisle temp of 20.6C (69F) and average humidity of 40.3%. This is attributed to Switch’s patented hot aisle containment and HVAC technologies.\n\nAs of the end of Q2 2015, Facebook's Prineville data center had a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1.078 and its Forest City data center had a PUE of 1.082.\n\nIn October 2015, Allied Control has a claimed PUE ratio of 1.02 through the use of 3M Novec 7100 fluid.\n\nIn January 2016, the \"Green IT Cube\" in Darmstadt was dedicated with a 1.07 PUE. It uses cold water cooling through the rack doors.\n\nIn February 2017, Supermicro has announced deployment of its disaggregated MicroBlade systems. An unnamed Fortune 100 company has deployed over 30,000 Supermicro MicroBlade servers at its Silicon Valley data center with a Power Use Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.06.\n\nThrough proprietary innovations in liquid cooling systems, French hosting company OVH has managed to attain a PUE ratio of 1.09 in its data centers in Europe and North America.\n\nPUE was published in 2016 as a global standard under ISO/IEC 30134-2:2016 as well as a European standard under EN 50600-4-2:2016.\n\n"}

The park is one of two original national parks in Denmark, the other one being 'National Park Dybbøl Skanser' from 1924, now called 'Historiecenter Dybbøl Banke' (English: Dybbøl Banke Museum and History Centre).\n\nRebild Bakker houses a number of museums.\n\nThe heaths of Rebild Hills (Danish: 'Rebild Bakker') was previously owned and used by the local peasants as pastures for their cattle, but it was bought up in the year 1911 and presented as a gift to the state of Denmark, to be administered on certain conditions (stipulations).\n\nThe founder of the Rebild National Park, was Dr. Max Henius, a Danish-American who emigrated to the United States in 1881 and settled in Chicago. In 1911, almost of the hilly countryside were bought with funds raised by Danish Americans. In 1912, Max Henius presented the deed to the land to his Majesty King Christian X as a permanent memorial to Danish Americans. Later the Danish government added to the land, that now features a beautiful natural park.\n\nThe first Rebild Festival took place in 1912, when King Christian X spoke to a crowd of 10,000. The day has been celebrated every single year since then, with the exception of the periods during World War I and World War II. American sculptor Georg J. Lober created an emblem for the Danish National Park in Rebild in 1912 and also made a bronze relief of Abraham Lincoln located in Rebild Park.\n\nIn 1925 Mindeparken was inaugurated in the city of Aarhus by King Christian X and it was planned to celebrate the Danish-American gatherings as well as visiting Danish citizens living abroad there. As the Rebild Festival gained momentum, Mindeparken was dropped and used for other purposes.\n\nThe park was given to the Danish state, as a present with three conditions:\n\nRebild National Park is the site of what is commonly believed to be the largest annual 4th of July celebration held outside the United States. Since 1912, The Rebild National Park Society Inc., a Danish-American friendship organization, has held a July 4 weekend festival that serves as a homecoming for Danish-Americans. This has helped make Rebild Park one of Denmark's major tourist attractions.\n\nThe Rebild Festival traditionally features the hoisting of the U.S. and Danish flags while the two countries' national anthems echo in the surrounding hills. The annual 4 July celebration was the subject of the television documentary \"Rebildfest 1990\", which featured actor Richard Chamberlain.\n\nRebild National Park also houses an annual Christmas market on Advent Sunday with around 5,000 visitors.\n\n\n"}

The overall goal of AToL is to resolve evolutionary relationships for large groups of organisms throughout the history of life, with the research often involving large teams working across institutions and disciplines. Investigators are typically supported for projects in data acquisition, analysis, algorithm development and dissemination in computational phylogenetics and phyloinformatics.\n\nThe Phylogenetic and Genomic Approaches to Reconstructing the Red Algal Tree of Life focus on the Rhodophyta (red algae), one of the most ancient eukaryotic phyla with fossil evidence for Bangiales stretching back 1.2 billion years. Red algae are not only key members of marine and freshwater aquatic environments but they are sources for important human foods such as dulse and sushi wrap, and have a multitude of pharmaceutical and industrial uses (e.g., agarose and carrageenans). Perhaps most important is the role red algae played in symbiogenesis. A red alga was the ancient (>1 billion years ago) donor of the plastid in chlorophyll c-containing algae (heterokonta or stramenophiles) that rose to prominence in marine ecosystems after the end of Permian with groups such as diatoms currently providing ca. 20% of global fixed carbon.\n\nThe aims of RedToL are: 1) reconstruct a robust phylogeny of 471 red algal species using a concatenated dataset of 2 nuclear, 4 plastid, and 2 mitochondrial encoded gene markers; 2) sequence plastid genomes and generate transcriptome databases for 16 key taxa that represent the phylogenetic (e.g., class- and order-level) breadth of the red algae, 3) make freely available red algal multi-gene and genome data via release to GenBank and a project-specific web site. The outreach and student mentoring program is an important component of the RedToL initiative.\n\nThe 471 chosen species from 294 genera represent the diversity of ca. 6,000 red algal species (i.e., ca. 35% of all red algal genera will be included, which represent all extant orders). The robust phylogenetic framework resulting from this study is the basis for a comprehensive taxonomic revision of the red algae and provides the basis for interpreting key innovations during red algal evolution. Because the chosen marker genes are shared across different Assembling the Tree of Life (AToL) projects, it will provide a common framework for a future comprehensive eukaryotic tree. Complete plastid genome and transcriptome data from 16 major red algal taxa will provide a genome inventory to facilitate understanding of red algal evolution, as well as provide the basis for phylogenetic analyses using a rich set (i.e., 100s) of vertically inherited genes. The genome data will specifically test the relationships among the major classes and orders of red algae. The RedToL team members come from eight institutions including two foreign collaborators and fifteen advisory board members and represent the most prominent active national and international red algal specialists from different generations who use different methods (from taxonomy to phylogenomics) to enhance understanding of red algal biology.\n\n"}

He made numerous contributions in high altitude research of the Earth's atmosphere. He was a pioneer of scientific aeronautics and considered a co-founder of aerology. \n\nIn 1868 he received his medical doctorate in Berlin, and from 1870 to 1879 was a general practitioner in Bad Freienwalde. In 1879 he returned to Magdeburg to practice medicine. In 1885 he earned a doctorate in secondary studies at the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Halle, and subsequently became a scientific officer at the Royal Meteorological Institute at Berlin-Grünau. From 1905 to 1914 Assmann was director of the Prussian Royal Aeronautical Observatory at , and afterwards was an honorary professor at the University of Giessen.\n\nFrom 1887 to 1892, with airship designer Rudolf Hans Bartsch von Sigsfeld (1861–1902), he developed a psychrometer for accurate measurement of atmospheric humidity and temperature. This was the first instrument that was able to provide reliable temperature readings with high altitude balloons, as it was capable of shielding its thermometric elements from solar radiation. The technical implementation and production of this device took place in the factory of Rudolf Fuess (1838–1917).\n\nFrom 1888 to 1899, he was a member of the \"Verein zur Förderung der Luftschifffahrt\", from which he organized scientific balloon ascents in order to study the atmosphere. From these studies, valuable insights in regards to atmospheric stratification of the troposphere were made. He is also credited for popularizing the field of meteorology, and played a significant role in several scientific newspapers and magazines during his career. From 1884 until his death, Assmann published the popular monthly magazine \"Das Wetter\" (The Weather). \n\nWith Léon Teisserenc de Bort (1855–1913), he is credited as co-discoverer of the stratosphere, as both men announced their discovery during the same time period in 1902. \n\nIn 1903, with meteorologist Arthur Berson (1859–1942), he was awarded the Buys Ballot Medal by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54957", "title": "Younger Dryas", "text": "Younger Dryas\n\nThe Younger Dryas (c. 12,900 to c. 11,700 years BP) was a return to glacial conditions which temporarily reversed the gradual climatic warming after the Last Glacial Maximum started receding around 20,000 BP. It is named after an indicator genus, the alpine-tundra wildflower \"Dryas octopetala\", as its leaves are occasionally abundant in the Late Glacial, often minerogenic-rich, like the lake sediments of Scandinavian lakes.\n\nPhysical evidence of a sharp decline in temperature over most of the Northern Hemisphere, discovered by geological research, has been the key physical evidence found for the Younger Dryas. This temperature change occurred at the end of what the earth sciences refer to as the Pleistocene epoch and immediately before the current, warmer Holocene epoch. In the social sciences, this time frame coincides with the final stages of the Upper Paleolithic.\n\nThe Younger Dryas was the most recent and longest of several interruptions to the gradual warming of the Earth's climate since the severe Last Glacial Maximum, c. 27,000 to 24,000 years BP. The change was relatively sudden, taking place in decades, and it resulted in a decline of 2 to 6 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 10.8 degrees Fahrenheit) and advances of glaciers and drier conditions, over much of the temperate northern hemisphere. It is thought to have been caused by a decline in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which transports warm water from the Equator towards the North Pole, in turn thought to have been caused by an influx of fresh cold water from North America to the Atlantic.\n\nThe Younger Dryas was a period of climatic change, but the effects were complex and variable. In the Southern Hemisphere and some areas of the Northern Hemisphere, such as southeastern North America, there was a slight warming.\n\nThe presence of a distinct cold period at the end of the Late Glacial interval has been known for a long time. Paleobotanical and lithostratigraphic studies of Swedish and Danish bog and lake sites, like in the Allerød clay pit in Denmark, first recognized and described the Younger Dryas.\n\nThe Younger Dryas is the youngest and longest of three stadials, which resulted from typically abrupt climatic changes that took place over the last 16,000 calendar years. Within the Blytt–Sernander classification of north European climatic phases, the prefix \"Younger\" refers to the recognition that this original \"Dryas\" period was preceded by a warmer stage, the Allerød oscillation, which, in turn, was preceded by the Older Dryas, around 14,000 calendar years BP. That is not securely dated, and estimates vary by 400 years, but it is generally accepted that it lasted around 200 years. In northern Scotland, the glaciers were thicker and more extensive than during the Younger Dryas. The Older Dryas, in turn, was preceded by another warmer stage, the Bølling oscillation, that separated it from a third and even older stadial, often known as the Oldest Dryas. The Oldest Dryas occurred approximately 1,770 calendar years before the Younger Dryas and lasted about 400 calendar years. According to the GISP2 ice core from Greenland, the Oldest Dryas occurred between about 15,070 and 14,670 calendar years BP.\n\nIn Ireland, the Younger Dryas has also been known as the Nahanagan Stadial, and in Great Britain, it has been called the Loch Lomond Stadial. In the Greenland Summit ice core chronology, the Younger Dryas corresponds to \"Greenland Stadial 1 (GS-1). \" The preceding Allerød warm period (interstadial) is subdivided into three events: \"Greenland Interstadial-1c to 1a (GI-1c to GI-1a)\".\n\nSince 1916 and the onset and then the refinement of pollen analytical techniques and a steadily-growing number of pollen diagrams, palynologists have concluded that the Younger Dryas was a distinct period of vegetational change in large parts of Europe during which vegetation of a warmer climate was replaced by that of a generally-cold climate, a glacial plant succession that often contained \"Dryas octopetala\". The drastic change in vegetation is typically interpreted to be an effect of a sudden decrease in (annual) temperature, unfavorable for the forest vegetation that had been spreading northward rapidly. The cooling not only favored the expansion of cold-tolerant, light-demanding plants and associated steppe fauna but also led to regional glacial advances in Scandinavia and a lowering of the regional snow line.\n\nThe change to glacial conditions at the onset of the Younger Dryas in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, between 12,900–11,500 calendar years BP, has been argued to have been quite abrupt. It is in sharp contrast to the warming of the preceding Older Dryas interstadial. It has been inferred that its end occurred over a period of a decade or so, but the onset may have even been faster. Thermally-fractionated nitrogen and argon isotope data from Greenland ice core GISP2 indicate that its summit was approximately colder during the Younger Dryas than today.\n\nIn Great Britain, beetle fossil evidence suggests that mean annual temperature dropped to , and periglacial conditions prevailed in lowland areas, and icefields and glaciers formed in upland areas. Nothing of the period's size, extent, or rapidity of abrupt climate change has been experienced since its end.\n\nIn addition to the Younger, Older, and Oldest Dryases, a century-long period of colder climate, similar to the Younger Dryas in abruptness, has occurred within both the Bølling oscillation and the Allerød oscillation interstadials. The cold period which occurred within the Bølling oscillation is known as the intra-Bølling cold period (IBCP), and the cold period which occurred within the Allerød oscillation is known as the intra-Allerød cold period (IACP). Both cold periods are comparable in duration and intensity with the Older Dryas and began and ended quite abruptly. The cold periods have been recognized in sequence and relative magnitude in paleoclimatic records from Greenland ice cores, European lacustrine sediments, Atlantic Ocean sediments, and the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela.\n\nExamples of older Younger Dryas-like events have been reported from the ends (called \"terminations\") of older glacial periods. Temperature-sensitive lipids, long chain alkenones, found in lake and marine sediments, are well-regarded as a powerful paleothermometer for the quantitative reconstruction of past continental climates. The application of alkenone paleothermometers to high-resolution paleotemperature reconstructions of older glacial terminations have found that very similar, Younger Dryas-like paleoclimatic oscillations occurred during Terminations II and IV. If so, the Younger Dryas is not the unique paleoclimatic event, in terms of size, extent, and rapidity, as it is often regarded to be. Furthermore, paleoclimatologists and Quaternary geologists reported finding what they characterized as well-expressed Younger Dryas events in the Chinese δ records of Termination III in stalagmites from high-altitude caves in Shennongjia area, Hubei Province, China. Various paleoclimatic records from ice cores, deep-sea sediments, speleothems, continental paleobotanical data, and loesses show similar abrupt climate events, which are consistent with Younger Dryas events, during the terminations of the last four glacial periods. They argue that Younger Dryas events might be an intrinsic feature of deglaciations that occur at the end of glacial periods.\n\nAnalyses of stable isotopes from Greenland ice cores provide estimates for the start and end of the Younger Dryas. The analysis of Greenland Summit ice cores, as part of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project-2 (GISP-2) and Greenland Icecore Project (GRIP), estimated that the Younger Dryas started about 12,800 ice (calendar) years BP. Depending on the specific ice core analysis consulted, the Younger Dryas is estimated to have lasted 1,150–1,300 years. Measurements of oxygen isotopes from the GISP2 ice core suggest the ending of the Younger Dryas took place over just 40 to 50 years in three discrete steps, each lasting five years. Other proxy data, such as dust concentration and snow accumulation, suggest an even more rapid transition, which would require about of warming in just a few years. Total warming in Greenland was .\n\nThe end of the Younger Dryas has been dated to around 11,550 years ago, occurring at 10,000 BP (uncalibrated radiocarbon year), a \"radiocarbon plateau\" by a variety of methods, mostly with consistent results:\n\nThe International Commission on Stratigraphy put the start of the Greenlandian stage, and implicitly the end of the Younger Dryas, at 11,700 years before 2000.\n\nAlthough the start of the Younger Dryas is regarded to be synchronous across the North Atlantic region, recent research concluded that the start of the Younger Dryas might be time-trangressive even within there. After an examination of laminated varve sequences, Muschitiello and Wohlfarth found that the environmental changes that define the beginning of the Younger Dryas are diachronous in their time of occurrence according to latitude. According to the changes, the Younger Dryas occurred as early as c. 12,900–13,100 calendar years ago along latitude 56–54°N. Further north, they found that the changes occurred at c. 12,600–12,750 calendar years ago.\n\nAccording to the analyses of varved sediments from Lake Suigetsu, Japan, and other paleoenvironmental records from Asia, a substantial delay occurred in the onset and the end of the Younger Dryas between Asia and the North Atlantic. For example, paleoenvironmental analysis of sediment cores from Lake Suigetsu in Japan found the Younger Dryas temperature decline of 2–4 °C between 12,300 and 11,250 varve (calendar) years BP, instead of about 12,900 calendar years BP in the North Atlantic region.\n\nIn contrast, the abrupt shift in the radiocarbon signal from apparent radiocarbon dates of 11,000 radiocarbon years to radiocarbon dates of 10,700–10,600 radiocarbon years BP in terrestrial macrofossils and tree rings in Europe over a 50-year period occurred at the same time in the varved sediments of Lake Suigetsu. However, this same shift in the radiocarbon signal predates the start of Younger Dryas at Lake Suigetsu by a few hundred years. Interpretations of data from Chinese also confirm that the Younger Dryas East Asia lags the North Atlantic Younger Dryas cooling by at least 200 to 300 years. Although\nthe interpretation of the data is more murky and ambiguous, it is likely that end of the Younger Dryas and the start of Holocene warming were similarly delayed in Japan and in other parts of East Asia.\n\nSimilarly, an analysis of a stalagmite growing from a cave in Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, Palawan, Philippines, found that the onset of the Younger Dryas was also delayed there. Proxy data recorded in the stalagmite indicated that it took more than 550 calendar years for Younger Dryas drought conditions to reach their full extent in the region and about 450 calendar years to return to pre-Younger Dryas levels after it ended.\n\nIn Western Europe and Greenland, the Younger Dryas is a well-defined synchronous cool period. Cooling in the tropical North Atlantic may, however, have preceded it by a few hundred years; South America shows a less well-defined initiation but a sharp termination. The Antarctic Cold Reversal appears to have started a thousand years before the Younger Dryas and has no clearly defined ; Peter Huybers has argued that there is a fair confidence in the absence of the Younger Dryas in Antarctica, New Zealand and parts of Oceania. Timing of the tropical counterpart to the Younger Dryas, the Deglaciation Climate Reversal (DCR), is difficult to establish as low latitude ice core records generally lack independent dating over the interval. An example of this is the Sajama ice core (Bolivia), for which the timing of the DCR has been pinned to that of the GISP2 ice core record (central Greenland). Climatic change in the central Andes during the DCR, however, was significant and was characterized by a shift to much wetter and likely colder conditions. The magnitude and abruptness of the changes would suggest that low latitude climate did not respond passively during the YD/DCR.\n\nEffects of the Younger Dryas were of varying intensity throughout North America. In western North America, its effects were less intense than in Europe or northeast North America; however, evidence of a glacial re-advance indicates that Younger Dryas cooling occurred in the Pacific Northwest. Speleothems from the Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve in southern Oregon's Klamath Mountains yield evidence of climatic cooling contemporaneous to the Younger Dryas.\n\nOther features include the following:\n\n\nThe Younger Dryas is a period significant to the study of the response of biota to abrupt climate change and to the study of how humans coped with such rapid changes. The effects of sudden cooling in the North Atlantic had strongly regional effects in North America, with some areas experiencing more abrupt changes than others.\n\nThe effects of the Younger Dryas cooling impacted New England and parts of maritime Canada more rapidly than the rest of the United States at the beginning and the end of the Younger Dryas chronozone. Proxy indicators show that summer temperature conditions in Maine decreased by up to 7.5C. Cool summers, combined with cold winters and low precipitation, resulted in a treeless tundra up to the onset of the Holocene, when the boreal forests shifted north.\n\nVegetation in the central Appalachian Mountains east towards the Atlantic Ocean was dominated by spruce (\"Picea\" spp.) and tamarack (\"Larix laricina)\" boreal forests that later changed rapidly to temperate, more broad-leaf tree forest conditions at the end of the Younger Dryas period. Conversely, pollen and macrofossil evidence from near Lake Ontario indicates that cool, boreal forests persisted into the early Holocene. West of the Appalachians, in the Ohio River Valley and south to Florida rapid, no-analog vegetation responses seem to have been the result of rapid climate changes, but the area remained generally cool, with hardwood forest dominating. During the Younger Dryas, the Southeastern United States was warmer and wetter than the region had been during the Pleistocene because of trapped heat from the Caribbean within the North Atlantic Gyre caused by a weakened Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC).\n\nThere was also a gradient of changing effects from the Great Lakes region south to Texas and Louisiana. Climatic forcing moved cold air into the northern portion of the American interior, much as it did the Northeast. Although there was not as abrupt a delineation as seen on the Eastern Seaboard, the Midwest was significantly colder in the northern interior than it was south, towards the warmer climatic influence of the Gulf of Mexico. In the north, the Laurentide Ice Sheet re-advanced during the Younger Dryas, depositing a moraine from west Lake Superior to southeast Quebec. Along the southern margins of the Great Lakes, spruce dropped rapidly while pine increased, and herbaceous prairie vegetation decreased in abundance but increased west of the region.\n\nEffects in the Rocky Mountain region were varied. In the northern Rockies, a significant increase in pines and firs suggests warmer conditions than before and a shift to subalpine parkland in places. That is hypothesized to be the result of a northward shift in the jet stream, combined with an increase in summer insolation as well as a winter snow pack that was higher than today, with prolonged and wetter spring seasons. There were minor re-advancements of glaciers in place, particularly in the northern ranges, but several sites in the Rocky Mountain ranges show little to no changes in vegetation during the Younger Dryas. Evidence also indicates an increase in precipitation in New Mexico because of the same Gulf conditions that were influencing Texas.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest region experienced 2 to 3C of cooling and an increase in precipitation. Glacial re-advancement has been recorded in British Columbia as well as in the Cascade Range. An increase of pine pollen indicates cooler winters within the central Cascades. Speleothem records indicate an increase in precipitation in southern Oregon, the timing of which coincides with increased sizes of pluvial lakes in the northern Great Basin. A pollen record from the Siskiyou Mountains suggests a lag in timing of the Younger Dryas, indicating a greater influence of warmer Pacific conditions on that range, but the pollen record is less chronologically constrained than the aforementioned speleothem record. The Southwest appears to have seen an increase in precipitation as well, also with an average 2 of cooling.\n\nThe Younger Dryas is often linked to the Neolithic Revolution, the adoption of agriculture in the Levant. It is argued that the cold and dry Younger Dryas lowered the carrying capacity of the area and forced the sedentary Early Natufian population into a more mobile subsistence pattern. Further climatic deterioration is thought to have brought about cereal cultivation. While there is relative consensus regarding the role of the Younger Dryas in the changing subsistence patterns during the Natufian, its connection to the beginning of agriculture at the end of the period is still being debated.\n\nBased upon solid geological evidence, consisting largely of the analysis of numerous deep cores from coral reefs, variations in the rates of sea level rise have been reconstructed for the postglacial period. For the early part of the sea level rise that is associated with deglaciation, three major periods of accelerated sea level rise, called \"meltwater pulses\", occurred. They are commonly called \"meltwater pulse 1A0\" for the one between 19,000 and 19,500 calendar years ago; \"meltwater pulse 1A\" for the one between 14,600 and 14,300 calendar years ago and \"meltwater pulse 1B\" for the one 11,400 and 11,100 calendar years ago. The Younger Dryas occurred after meltwater pulse 1A, a 13.5 m rise over about 290 years, centered at about 14,200 calendar years ago, and before meltwater pulse 1B, a 7.5 m rise over about 160 years, centered at about 11,000 calendar years ago. Finally, not only did the Younger Dryas postdate both all of meltwater pulse 1A and predate all of meltwater pulse 1B, it was a period of significantly-reduced rate of sea level rise relative to the periods of time immediately before and after it.\n\nPossible evidence of short-term sea level changes has been reported for the beginning of the Younger Dryas. First, the plotting of data by Bard and others suggests a small step, less than 6 m, in sea level near the onset of the Younger Dryas. There is a possible corresponding change in the rate of change of sea level rise seen in the data from both Barbados and Tahiti. Given that this change is \"within the overall uncertainty of the approach,\" it was concluded that a relatively smooth sea-level rise, with no significant accelerations, occurred then. Finally, research by Lohe and others in western Norway has reported a sea-level low-stand at 13,640 calendar years ago and a subsequent Younger Dryas transgression starting at 13,080 calendar years ago. They concluded that the timing of the Allerød low-stand and the subsequent transgression were the result of increased regional loading of the crust, and geoid changes were caused by an expanding ice sheet, which started growing and advancing in the early Allerød about 13,600 calendar years ago, well before the start of the Younger Dryas.\n\nThe current theory is that the Younger Dryas was caused by significant reduction or shutdown of the North Atlantic \"Conveyor\", which circulates warm tropical waters northward, in response to a sudden influx of fresh water from Lake Agassiz and deglaciation in North America. Geological evidence for such an event is so far lacking. The global climate would then have become locked into the new state until freezing removed the fresh water \"lid\" from the North Atlantic. An alternative theory suggests instead that the jet stream shifted northward in response to the changing topographic forcing of the melting North American ice sheet, which brought more rain to the North Atlantic, which freshened the ocean surface enough to slow the thermohaline circulation.\n\nThere is also some evidence that a solar flare may have been responsible for the megafaunal extinction, but that cannot explain the apparent variability in the extinction across all continents.\n\nA hypothesized Younger Dryas impact event, presumed to have occurred in North America about 12,900 calendar years ago, has been proposed as the mechanism that initiated the Younger Dryas cooling.\n\nAmong other things, findings of melt-glass material in sediments in Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Syria have been reported. The researchers argue that the material, which dates back nearly 13,000 years, was formed at temperatures of as the result of a bolide impact. They argue that these findings support the controversial Younger Dryas Boundary (YDB) hypothesis: that the bolide impact occurred at the onset of the Younger Dryas. The hypothesis has been questioned in research that concluded that most of the results cannot be confirmed by other scientists and that the authors misinterpreted the data.\n\nAfter a review of the sediments found at the sites, new research has found that the sediments claimed by hypothesis proponents to be deposits resulting from a bolide impact date from much later or much earlier times than the proposed date of the cosmic impact. The researchers examined 29 sites commonly referenced to support the impact theory to determine if they can be geologically dated to around 13,000 years ago. Crucially, only three of those sites actually date from then.\n\nIn a study published in the \"Journal of Geology\" issue of September 2014, Charles R. Kinzie (et al.) looked at the distribution of nanodiamonds produced during extraterrestrial collisions: 50 million square kilometers of the Northern Hemisphere at the YDB were found to have the nanodiamonds. Only two layers exist showing these nanodiamonds: the YDB 12,800 calendar years ago and the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, 65 million years ago, which, in addition, is marked by mass extinctions.\n\nNew support for the cosmic-impact hypothesis of the origin of the YDB was published in 2018. It postulates Earth's collision with one or more fragments from a larger (over 100-km diameter) disintegrating comet (some remnants of which have persisted within the inner solar system to the present day). Evidence is presented consistent with large-scale biomass burning (wildfires) following the putative collision. The evidence is derived from analyses of ice cores, glaciers, lake- and marine-sediment cores, and terrestrial sequences. Also in 2018, evidence of a 31km diameter impact crater was found below the Greenland ice cap, along with evidence of impact shock quartz which — it was speculated — might have been connected with the Younger Dryas period.\n\nThe Laacher See volcano erupted at approximately the same time as the beginning of the Younger Dryas, and has historically been suggested as a possible cause. Laacher See is a maar lake, a lake within a broad low-relief volcanic crater about 2 km (1.2 mi) diameter. It is in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, about 24 km (15 mi) northwest of Koblenz and 37 km (23 mi) south of Bonn. The maar lake is within the Eifel mountain range, and is part of the East Eifel volcanic field within the larger \"Vulkaneifel\". This eruption was of sufficient size, VEI 6, with over 20 km (2.4 cu mi) tephra ejected, to have caused significant temperature change in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nCurrently available evidence suggests that the hypothesis that the Laacher See eruption triggered the Younger Dryas has considerable merit. Earlier, the hypothesis was dismissed based on the timing of the Laacher See Tephra relative to the clearest signs of climate change associate with the Younger Dryas Event within various Central European varved lake deposits. This set the scene for the development of the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis and the meltwater pulse hypothesis. However, more recent research places the very large eruption of the Laacher See volcano at 12,880 years BP, coinciding with the initiation of North Atlantic cooling into the Younger Dryas. Although the eruption was about twice size as the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, it contained considerably more sulfur, potentially rivalling the climatologically very significant 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in terms of amount of sulfur introduced into the atmosphere. Evidence exists that an eruption of this magnitude and sulfur content occurring during deglaciation could trigger a long-term positive feedback involving sea ice and oceanic circulation, resulting in a cascade of climate shifts across the North Atlantic and the globe. Further support for this hypothesis appears as a large volcanogenic sulfur spike within Greenland ice, coincident with both the date of the Laacher See eruption and the beginning of cooling into the Younger Dryas as recorded in Greenland. The mid-latitude westerly winds may have tracked sea ice growth southward across the North Atlantic as the cooling became more pronounced, resulting in time transgressive climate shifts across northern Europe and explaining the lag between the Laacher See Tephra and the clearest (wind-derived) evidence for the Younger Dryas in central European lake sediments.\n\nAlthough the timing of the eruption appears to coincide with the beginning of the Younger Dryas, and the amount of sulfur contained would have been enough to result in substantial Northern Hemisphere cooling, the hypothesis has not yet been tested thoroughly, and no climate model simulations are currently available. The exact nature of the positive feedback is also unknown, and questions remain regarding the sensitivity to the deglacial climate to a volcanic forcing of the size and sulfur content of the Laacher See eruption. However, evidence exists that a similar feedback following other volcanic eruptions could also have triggered similar long-term cooling events during the last glacial period, the Little Ice Age, and the Holocene in general, suggesting that the proposed feedback is poorly constrained but potentially common.\n\nIt is possible that the Laacher See eruption was triggered by lithospheric unloading related to the removal of ice during the last deglaciation, a concept that is supported by the observation that three of the largest eruptions within the East Eifel Volcanic Field occurred during deglaciation. Because of this potential relationship to lithospheric unloading, the Laacher See eruption hypothesis suggests that eruptions such as the 12,880 year BP Laacher See eruption are not isolated in time and space, but instead are a fundamental part of deglaciation, thereby also explaining the presence of Younger Dryas-type events during other glacial terminations.\n\nStudies by Senior Research Scientist Robert Brakenridge and others suggest correlations between the Younger Dryas and a supernova that exploded within the constellation of Vela approximately around the same time, leaving behind what is now known as the Vela Supernova Remnant. Brakenridge notes other researchers that have studied effects of close-by supernovae on earth and uncovered suggestive correlating evidence during the Younger Dryas, including depletion of the ozone layer, increased UV exposure, nitrogen changes on the Earth’s surface and troposphere, evidence of global cooling, changes in C and Be in ice cores, a thin layer (approximately 30 centimeters) of “black mats”, and many extinctions that may have been caused by the explosion of the Vela Supernova.\n\nWhile no cause is determined for the extinction of many species, it is suggested that a combination of some climatic change or being hunted by humans may have been a cause. Most of the species that became extinct were cold blooded species and Rancholabrean megafauna, including \"Mammathus Columbis\", \"Canis Diris\", and \"Camelops\". Survivors of the Younger Dryas included that of nocturnal low-birth rate species residing in the mountainous or forest-like terrains of the Americas, Eurasia, Australia, and in Madagascar. The largest, slow breeding, diurnal species that lived in more open spaces survived in the lower parts of Africa. There were also species that went extinct that were not expected to by humans in the America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\nAcross faunal and Paleoindian hunting sites, there has been evidence of carbon rich “black mats” that were approximately 30 centimeters thin, suggesting an abrupt change that occurred in a small time window and a rise in aquatic conditions. Brakenridge also discusses pollen core research that suggests global cooling conditions not to have just occurred in the Northern latitudes, but also latitudes as far as 41°south. Tree ring evidence shows a rise in C cosmogenic isotope. The increase may have also occurred around the same time of the increase of another cosmogenic isotope, Be.  Brakenridge discusses possibilities behind these rises, including climatic changes and carbon cycles or a more secular cause.\n\nAnother hypothesis that Brakenridge discusses is that effects of a supernova could have been a factor in the Younger Dryas. Effects of a supernova have been suggested before, but without confirming evidence. Brakenridge explains how with the following evidence that these effects could have been caused by a celestial event, a supernova;  observations of Gamma-ray bursts and X-ray flashes have been compared to nebular records to test this as well as supernovae flash models, comparable to the records of in-galaxy supernovae, to study the effects of such an event on Earth. These effects include depletion in the ozone later, increased UV exposure, global cooling, and nitrogen changes in the Earth’s surface and troposphere. As Brakenridge states, the only supernova possible at that time was the Vela Supernova, or classified as the Vela Supernova Remnant.\n\nThe failure of North Atlantic thermohaline circulation is used to explain rapid climate change in some science fiction writings as early as Stanley G. Weinbaum's 1937 short story \"Shifting Seas\" in which the author describes the freezing of Europe after the Gulf Stream is disrupted. It was used more recently in Kim Stanley Robinson's novels, particularly \"Fifty Degrees Below\". It also underpinned the 1999 book, \"The Coming Global Superstorm\".\n\nLikewise, the idea of rapid climate change caused by disruption of North Atlantic Ocean currents creates the setting for the 2004 apocalyptic science-fiction film \"The Day After Tomorrow\". Similar sudden cooling events have featured in other novels, such as John Christopher's \"The World in Winter\" but not always with the same explicit links to the Younger Dryas event as in the case of Robinson's work.\n\n\n"}
