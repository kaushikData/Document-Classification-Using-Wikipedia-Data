In 1977, the grove at the Mediterranean Sea side was declared a recreation area. On November 7, 2011, the area was declared a nature park by the Ministry of Environment and Forest. However the ministry decided to end its status as a nature park and there is a heated discussion on its future status \n\nIt has a long sandy beach. \"Gümüşkum\" means literally \"Silver sand\". The nature park offers outdoor recreational activities for visitors on daily basis such as hiking, swimming and picnicing. Camping and renting of cottages or bungalows are also available.\n\nThe trees in the park are Turkish pine (\"Pinus brutia\") and eucalyptus. The endemic plant sea daffodil (\"Pancratium maritimum\") is endangered. A section of the sandy beach in the nature park is used by green sea turtles (\"Chelonia mydas\") and loggerhead sea turtles (\"Caretta caretta\") for ovulation. A treatment and rehabilitation center for the sea turtles is situated inside the nature park.\n\nThe status of the protected area as \"nature park\" was revoked on July 14, 2015. It was decided to decrease its status to \"recreation area of grade A\". Upon protests of the residents of Mezitli and Mersin to protect and conserve the sea turtles, the Ministry cancelled its decision within about one month, and the status of the protected area remained unchanged.\n"}

In 1997, Farmer won the Newbery Honor for the novel, which was also a finalist for the National Book Award for Young People's Literature. The book explores the qualities needed to survive in a hostile environment (particularly by a woman), coming-of-age and the availability of spiritual guidance.\n\nNhamo is an 11-year-old girl living in a traditional Shona village located in Mozambique around 1981. She was raised with the knowledge and customs of her tribe. Nhamo means \"disaster\" in the Shona language. Nhamo was given this name because of the scandal and wrongful things continued to follow her and her mother. After experiencing trouble with a cholera epidemic, a leopard, and a prescribed marriage proposed by a false witch doctor, she flees with her dying grandmother's blessings, some gold nuggets, and her meager survival skills. Nhamo steals a boat and supplies under her grandmother's instructions and uses the river as her road to Zimbabwe, where she faces the threat of hippos, crocodiles, and other animals trying to kill her, while dealing with the pressures of becoming a woman.\n\nWhat should have been a two-day boat trip across the border to her father's family in Zimbabwe spans a year in which Nhamo faces starvation and the threat of hungry or aggressive animals. The girl finds her way to a lush, haunted island and lives alongside a troop of baboons. Daily conversations with spirits combat Nhamo's loneliness and provide her with sage and practical advice. She makes mistakes, loses heart, and nearly dies of starvation. Even after she arrives in Zimbabwe where she lives with scientists before meeting her father's family, Nhamo must learn how to live in a modern society (clothing, behavior, literacy), and is urged to let go of the \"evil\" spirits that \"possess\" her as prescribed by a Muvuki or witch finder.\n\n\n"}

Part of his School series, it was released by Simon & Schuster in 2002.\n\nMr. Maxwell, a fifth grade science teacher, is in charge of the school‟s \"Week in the Woods\" program. He is an Eagle Scout and an avid outdoorsman. He has organized and carried out this program for sixteen years. He is totally organized and prepared, months in advance, for the upcoming week in the woods, but there is something that he doesn't know, something that he cannot prepare for, which is trouble.\n\nMark Chelmsley IV, a rich child living in New York, is unhappy about moving to a small town in New Hampshire. His parents work constantly and are extremely wealthy, but often spend very little with him. Mark is closer to Anya and Leon, a Russian couple employed as his family's maid and butler. Mark is assigned to Mr. Maxwell's class, where his know-it-all attitude, wealthy background, and lack of effort quickly turn Mr. Maxwell against him.\n\nAt school, Mark chooses not to make friends, not to complete his work, not to even become involved, deciding that his time at school will be temporary and that he has nothing to gain. However, he gradually starts to become friends with other students in his class and develops a genuine interest in attending the \"Week in the Woods\", despite rudely rejecting Mr. Maxwell's initial offer. Mr. Maxwell reluctantly allows him to attend and Mark enjoys spending time in the woods with his new friends.\n\nAs Mr. Maxwell and Mark's impressions of one another begin to improve, it is quickly derailed when a knife belonging to Mark's friend is found in their tent. Mark decides to take the blame, believing that Mr. Maxwell is looking for an excuse to send him away. When Mark's prediction proves to be true and he is told to go home early, Mark tries to prove that he can survive in the woods on his own. Mr. Maxwell soon realizes that he has been treating Mark unfairly when he discovers Mark did not bring the knife and is distressed to learn that Mark has disappeared into the woods. Though Mr. Maxwell finds Mark, he is injured and needs to rely on Mark for them to return safely to the campgrounds. They come to an understanding with one another during their return and promise to be more open to one another in the future.\n\nThe book was critically acclaimed, and nominated for a number of awards, including California Young Reader Medal, Golden Sower Masterlist (NE), Kentucky Bluegrass Award, and the Land of Enchantment Children's Master List (NM). The book won the Iowa Children's Choice Awards (2004–2005). and the Keystone to Reading Book Award of Pennsylvania (2005).\n\n"}

Dirac.\nOne of the triumphs of the Dirac equation is\nits prediction of the existence of antimatter particles.\nAntiprotons, positrons, and antineutrons\nare now well understood,\nand can be created and studied in experiments.\n\nHigh-precision experiments have been unable to\ndetect any difference between the masses\nof particles and\nthose of the corresponding antiparticles.\nThey also have been unable to detect any difference between the magnitudes of\nthe charges,\nor between the lifetimes,\nof particles and antiparticles.\nThese mass, charge, and lifetime symmetries\nare required in a Lorentz and CPT symmetric universe,\nbut are only a small number of the properties that need to match\nif the universe is Lorentz and CPT symmetric.\n\nThe Standard-Model Extension (SME),\na comprehensive theoretical framework for Lorentz and CPT violation,\nmakes specific predictions\nabout how particles and antiparticles\nwould behave differently in a universe\nthat is very close to,\nbut not exactly,\nLorentz symmetric.\nIn loose terms,\nthe SME can be visualized\nas being constructed from\nfixed background fields\nthat interact weakly, but differently,\nwith particles and antiparticles.\n\nThe behavioral differences between\nmatter and antimatter\nare specific to each individual experiment.\nFactors that determine the behavior include\nthe particle species involved,\nthe electromagnetic, gravitational, and nuclear fields controlling the system.\nFurthermore,\nfor any Earth-bound experiment,\nthe rotational and orbital motion of the Earth is important,\nleading to sidereal and seasonal signals.\nFor experiments conducted in space, the orbital motion of the craft\nis an important factor in determining the signals\nof Lorentz violation that might arise.\nTo harness the predictive power of the SME in any specific system,\na calculation has to be performed\nso that all these factors can be accounted for.\nThese calculations are facilitated by the reasonable assumption that Lorentz\nviolations, if they exist,\nare small. This makes it possible to use perturbation theory to obtain results\nthat would otherwise be extremely difficult to find.\n\nThe SME generates a modified Dirac equation\nthat breaks Lorentz symmetry\nfor some types of particle motions, but not others.\nIt therefore holds important information\nabout how Lorentz violations might have been hidden\nin past experiments,\nor might be revealed in future ones.\n\nA Penning trap\nis a research apparatus\ncapable of trapping individual charged particles\nand their antimatter counterparts.\nThe trapping mechanism is\na strong magnetic field that keeps the particles near a central axis,\nand an electric field that turns the particles around\nwhen they stray too far along the axis.\nThe motional frequencies of the trapped particle\ncan be monitored and measured with astonishing precision.\nOne of these frequencies is the anomaly frequency,\nwhich has played an important role in the measurement\nof the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron (see ).\n\nThe first calculations of SME effects\nin Penning traps\nwere published in 1997\nand 1998.\nThey showed that,\nin identical Penning traps,\nif the\nanomaly frequency of an electron was increased,\nthen the anomaly frequency of a positron\nwould be decreased.\nThe size of the increase or decrease\nin the frequency\nwould be a measure of\nthe strength of one of the SME background fields.\nMore specifically,\nit is a measure\nof the component of the background field\nalong the direction of the axial magnetic field.\n\nIn tests of Lorentz symmetry,\nthe noninertial nature of the laboratory\ndue to the rotational and orbital motion of the Earth\nhas to be taken into account.\nEach Penning-trap measurement\nis the projection of the background SME fields\nalong the axis of the experimental magnetic field\nat the time of the experiment.\nThis is further complicated if the experiment takes\nhours, days, or longer to perform.\n\nOne approach is to seek instantaneous differences,\nby comparing anomaly frequencies\nfor a particle and an antiparticle\nmeasured at the same time on different days.\nAnother approach is to seek\nsidereal variations,\nby continuously monitoring\nthe anomaly frequency for just one species of particle\nover an extended time.\nEach offers different challenges.\nFor example,\ninstantaneous comparisons\nrequire the electric field in the trap to be\nprecisely reversed,\nwhile sidereal tests are limited\nby the stability of the magnetic field.\n\nAn experiment conducted by the physicist Gerald Gabrielse of Harvard University involved two particles confined in a Penning trap. The idea was to compare a proton and an antiproton, but to overcome the technicalities of having opposite charges,\na negatively charged hydrogen ion was used in place of the proton. The ion, two electrons bound electrostatically with a proton, and the antiproton have the same charge and can therefore be simultaneously trapped. This design allows for quick interchange of the proton and the antiproton and so an instantaneous-type Lorentz test can be performed. The cyclotron frequencies of the two trapped particles\nwere about 90 MHz, and the apparatus was capable of resolving differences\nin these of about 1.0 Hz. The absence of Lorentz violating effects of this type\nplaced a limit on combinations of formula_1-type SME coefficients that had not been accessed in other experiments. The results\nappeared in Physical Review Letters in 1999.\n\nThe Penning-trap group at the University of Washington, headed by the Nobel Laureate Hans Dehmelt, conducted a search for sidereal variations in the anomaly frequency of a trapped electron. The results were extracted from an experiment that ran for several weeks, and the analysis required splitting the data into \"bins\" according to the orientation of the apparatus in the inertial reference frame of the Sun. At a resolution of 0.20 Hz, they were unable to discern any sidereal variations in the anomaly frequency, which runs around 185,000,000 Hz. Translating this into an upper bound on the relevant\nSME background field, places a bound of about\n10 GeV on a formula_2-type electron coefficient.\nThis work\nwas published in Physical Review Letters in 1999.\n\nAnother experimental result from the Dehmelt group involved a comparison of the instantaneous type. Using data from a single trapped electron\nand a single trapped positron, they again found no difference\nbetween the two anomaly frequencies at a resolution of about 0.2 Hz.\nThis result placed a bound on a simpler combination of\nformula_2-type coefficients at a level of about 10 GeV.\nIn addition to being a limit on Lorentz violation,\nthis also limits the CPT violation.\nThis result\nappeared in Physical Review Letters in 1999.\n\nThe antihydrogen atom is\nthe antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom.\nIt has a negatively charged antiproton\nat the nucleus\nthat attracts a positively charged positron\norbiting around it.\n\nThe spectral lines of hydrogen have frequencies\ndetermined by the energy differences\nbetween the quantum-mechanical orbital states\nof the electron.\nThese lines\nhave been studied in thousands of spectroscopic experiments\nand are understood in great detail.\nThe quantum mechanics of the positron orbiting an antiproton\nin the antihydrogen atom is expected to be very similar\nto that of the hydrogen atom.\nIn fact,\nconventional physics predicts that the spectrum of antihydrogen\nis identical to that of regular hydrogen.\n\nIn the presence of the background fields of the SME,\nthe spectra of hydrogen and antihydrogen\nare expected to show tiny differences\nin some lines,\nand no differences in others.\nCalculations of these SME effects\nin antihydrogen and hydrogen\nwere published\nin Physical Review Letters\nin 1999.\nOne of the main results found\nis that hyperfine transitions\nare sensitive to Lorentz breaking effects.\n\nSeveral experimental groups at CERN\nare working on producing antihydrogen.\nThey are:\n\n\nCreating trapped antihydrogen\nin sufficient quantities\nto do spectroscopy\nis an enormous experimental challenge.\nSignatures of Lorentz violation\nare similar to those expected in Penning traps.\nThere would be sidereal effects\ncausing variations in the spectral frequencies\nas the experimental laboratory turns with the Earth.\nThere would also be the possibility of finding instantaneous\nLorentz breaking signals\nwhen antihydrogen spectra are compared directly with conventional hydrogen spectra\n\nIn October 2017, the BASE experiment at CERN reported a measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment to a precision of 1.5 parts per billion. It is consistent with the most precise measurement of the proton magnetic moment (also made by BASE in 2014), which supports the hypothesis of CPT symmetry. It should be noted that this measurement represents the first time that a property of antimatter is known more precisely than the equivalent property in matter.\n\nThe muon and its positively charged antiparticle\nhave been used to perform tests of Lorentz symmetry.\nSince the lifetime of the muon is only a few microseconds,\nthe experiments are quite different\nfrom ones with electrons and positrons.\nCalculations for muon experiments\naimed at probing Lorentz violation\nin the SME\nwere first published in the year 2000.\n\nIn the year 2001,\nHughes and collaborators published their results\nfrom a search for sidereal signals in the spectrum\nof muonium,\nan \"atom\" consisting of an electron bound to a negatively charged muon.\nTheir data,\ntaken over a two-year period,\nshowed no evidence for Lorentz violation.\nThis placed a stringent constraint on\na combination of formula_2-type coefficients in the SME,\npublished in Physical Review Letters.\n\nIn 2008,\nthe Muon formula_5 Collaboration at the Brookhaven National Laboratory published results after searching for signals of Lorentz violation with muons and antimuons.\nIn one type of analysis, they compared the anomaly frequencies\nfor the muon and its antiparticle. In another, they looked for sidereal variations by allocating their data into one-hour \"bins\" according to the orientation of the Earth relative to the Sun-centered inertial reference frame.\nTheir results, published in Physical Review Letters in 2008,\nshow no signatures of Lorentz violation at the resolution of the Brookhaven experiment.\n\nExperimental results in all sectors of the\nSME are summarized in the Data Tables for Lorentz and CPT violation.\n\n"}

Air bubbles are squeezed out and ice crystals enlarge, making the ice appear blue.\n\nSmall amounts of regular ice appear to be white because of air bubbles inside them and also because small quantities of water appear to be colourless. In glaciers, the pressure causes the air bubbles to be squeezed out, increasing the density of the created ice. Large quantities of water appear to be blue, as it absorbs other colours more efficiently than blue. A large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, similarly appears blue.\n\nThe blue color is sometimes wrongly attributed to Rayleigh scattering, which is responsible for the color of the sky. Rather, water ice is blue for the same reason that large quantities of liquid water are blue: it is a result of an overtone of an oxygen–hydrogen (O−H) bond stretch in water, which absorbs light at the red end of the visible spectrum. In the case of oceans or lakes, some of the light hitting the surface of water is reflected back directly, but most of it penetrates the surface, interacting with its molecules. The water molecule can vibrate in different modes when light hits it. The red, orange, yellow, and green wavelengths of light are absorbed so that the remaining light is composed of the shorter wavelengths of blue and violet. This is the main reason why the ocean is blue. So, water owes its intrinsic blueness to selective absorption in the red part of its visible spectrum. The absorbed photons promote transitions to high overtone and combination states of the nuclear motions of the molecule, i.e. to highly excited vibrations. \n\nAn example of blue ice was observed in Tasman Glacier, New Zealand in January 2011.\n\nBlue ice is exposed in areas of the Antarctic where there is no net addition or subtraction of snow. That is, any snow that falls in that area is counteracted by sublimation or other losses. These areas have been used as runways (e.g. Wilkins Runway, Novolazarevskaya, Patriot Hills Base Camp) due to their hard surface, which is suitable for aircraft fitted with wheels rather than skis.\n\n"}

He does this by taking the form of a family member or a loved one long not seen, or disguising himself as a prey animal. His uncanny ability to replicate others makes him impossible to tell apart, except for his mismatched feet.\n\nOthers say that he appears in the shape of a very short man dressed in rags waving his closed fists in the air looking for a fight. In this case, the indigenous peoples believe a man must accept his challenge and beat him until he uncovers all the richness he has hidden in the jungle.

Chullachaqui is a kind of a forest spirit who guards the lands and the animals and punishes a man if he breaks a taboo or otherwise acts unwisely in the forest. According to a local legend, Chullachaqui is a member of an older species, a species that lived there long before humans. Most of the time they remain quite uninterested in humans. They inhabit forest spots far from human inhabitance where they supposedly have their own gardens and fields to tend. If a human being dwells too close to those gardens, they might attack and put a spell on the unlucky human. Sometimes a Chullachaqui might also steal a human child and raise it as its own, or lure humans into its trap for mating purposes. A human thus stolen by the Chullachaqui becomes one of them.\n\n"}

The ecoregion extends from the Cross River in southeastern Nigeria to the Sanaga River in southeastern Cameroon, and up to 300 km inland from the Atlantic coast. In Nigeria the region more or less covers Cross River State.\n\nThe highlands of Mount Cameroon and of Bioko island, above 900 meters elevation, are a distinct ecoregion, the Mount Cameroon and Bioko montane forests, as are the Cameroonian Highlands forests further inland.

According to the Ministry of Energy, the country's primary energy consumption was 75.2 Mtoe (million tonnes of oil equivalent) in 2013, an increase of 2.6 percent over the previous year. According to British Petroleum, energy consumption was 115.6 Mtoe in 2013.\n\nThailand produces roughly one-third of the oil it consumes. It is the second largest importer of oil in SE Asia. Thailand is a large producer of natural gas, with reserves of at least 10 trillion cubic feet. After Indonesia, it is the largest coal producer in Southeast Asia, but must import additional coal to meet domestic demand.\n\nNinety percent of Thai electrical generating capacity is conventional thermal. Oil-fired plants have been replaced by natural gas, which as of 2016 powers 60 percent of electrical generation. Coal-fired plants produce an additional 20 percent, with the remainder from biomass, hydro, and biogas. the \nElectricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) produces 37 percent of Thailand's electricity; independent power producers, 35 percent; small power producers, 19 percent; and electricity imports, 9 percent.\n\nEnergy experts working for the World Wildlife Fund have calculated that Thailand and four Mekong Region neighbours could achieve 100 percent renewable energy electricity generation by 2050. Their study showed that these countries can produce and use electricity from solar power, wind power, biogas, and small run-of-the-river hydroelectricity. The findings conflict with government plans that discount renewables.\n\nRising temperatures increase electricity demand. It is estimated that cities the size of Bangkok may require as much as 2 gigawatts of additional electricity for each increase of 1 degree Celsius in temperature due to increased demand for air conditioning.\n\n\nNatural gas fuels approximately 60 percent of Thailand's electrical power generation.\n\nThe Erawan gas field in the Gulf of Thailand supplies about 20 percent of Thailand's gas production. The field is estimated to have a capacity of 885 million cf per day.\n\nIn 2013 Thailand produced approximately 18 million tonnes of lignite and imported roughly 19 million tonnes of bituminous coal. All of the lignite and six million tonnes of the bituminous coal was used to produce electricity, the remainder being used by industry.\n\nIn March 2016, the Thai government gave approval for homes and commercial buildings to install solar panels. Each house will be permitted to generate 10 kW and each factory 40 kW. The private sector, despite Thailand's ample solar resources, previously had no right to install power-generation equipment. The government's plan is to devise regulations in March, hold public hearings in April, and roll out the program in the summer of 2016. Power generation is expected to start at the end of 2016 or early-2017.\nThe government is promoting the production of biodiesel from palm oil to be blended with conventional diesel with the aim of reducing petroleum imports. The production goal is 5.97 million liters per day in 2021.\n\nThailand has no nuclear power plants. Earlier plans to produce five gigawatts of electricity by 2025 using nuclear technology were scaled back to 2 GW in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster.\n\nAs memories of Fukushima recede, interest in nuclear power has revived. Seven ASEAN nations, including Thailand, have signed cooperation agreements with Rosatom, Russia's state nuclear energy agency. EGAT is working with China, Japan, and South Korea on nuclear power generation technology and has sent 100 specialists to train for nuclear power plant projects. EGAT plans for up to five percent of the country's power generation to be generated from nuclear by 2036.\n\nAccording to Thailand's \"Power Development Plan for 2015-2036\", the country intends to build 20 additional gas-powered electrical generating stations (17,728 MWe), nine \"clean coal\" power stations (7,390 MWe), and 14,206 MW of renewable energy, including hydro, a large proportion of which will be imported from Laos or Myanmar. Up to two nuclear plants are also in the plans.\n\nCritics charge that power needs are overstated. Thailand plans for a reserve margin—the amount of energy available over that used at peak demand—of 15 percent. However, the plan identifies reserve margins as high as 39 percent in some years. The root cause is that Thailand regularly overestimates its economic growth, assuming it to be over four percent when it is historically around three percent.\n\nThe role of imported hydro is also at issue. In 2015, hydro accounted for approximately seven percent of Thailand's power output. Under the plan, it will rise to 15-20 percent by 2036, and additional hydro will be imported from the Xayaburi Dam on the Mekong River and from the Hat Gyi and Mong Ton dams in Myanmar. While these sources may look clean on Thailand's balance sheets, the devastating environmental impacts to locals are simply outsourced.\n\nMany have asked why Thailand pursues a few very large coal power plants when it could be adopting safer, possibly cheaper routes, such as biomass reactors, like the 40 MWe plant operated by Double A in Prachinburi using wood and offcuts. The answer may lie in the fact that large, centralised mega-projects benefit the centralised system of project approval. With a public sector corruption rate of 25 percent, according to the Thai Chamber of Commerce, they can be very beneficial for unscrupulous officials.\n\nThe government of Anand Panyarachun (1991-1992) began the process of energy industry liberalization. Its reforms included:\n\nThe subsequent government of Chuan Leekpai (1992-1995, 1997-2001) continued Anand's policies, with Sawit Bhodivihok taking a leading role in industry reform. The reforms were fiercely attacked by members of the EGAT, Metropolitan Energy Authority (MEA), and Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) unions. As a result, no significant changes in industry structure or ownership occurred during Chuan's term.\n\nIn September 2001, the National Energy Policy Office approved the partial listing of PTT, the state-owned oil and gas company.\n\nPTT swiftly became the largest company by market capitalization upon listing in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). PTT greatly profited from the global increase in worldwide oil prices following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the rise in its stock price helped propel the SET to a boom. However, anti-Thaksin critics have claimed that PTT's bull run was due to manipulation by Thaksin.\n\nLike Chuan, Thaksin repeatedly attempted to privatize the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). One of the goals of the privatization was to raise 42 billion baht from the IPO and use the funds to invest in three new natural-gas powered power plants.\n\nIn early-2004, massive employee protests forced the EGAT governor to resign, thus delaying the planned privatization of the state enterprise. Governor Kraisri Karnasuta worked with employees to address their concerns about the privatization, and by December 2004, it was claimed that approximately 80 percent of employees supported privatization. Permanent protest stages and tents at the EGAT headquarters were taken down as the state enterprise returned to normal. After the Mahachon Party (the only party that was officially against privatization of state enterprises) won only two seats in the February 2005 parliamentary elections, the process of EGAT's privatization was restarted. The agency was corporatized in June 2005, transforming it from the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand to EGAT PLC. However, EGAT's privatization was abruptly delayed when some NGOs and some union members filed a petition with the Supreme Court a few days before the scheduled listing on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET).\n\nOn 23 March 2006, the Supreme Administrative Court ruled against the privatization of EGAT PLC, citing conflicts of interest, public hearing irregularities, and the continued right of expropriation. The court said that Olarn Chaipravat, a board member of PTT and Shin Corporation (both business partners of EGAT), was on a committee involved in the legal preparation of Egat's privatisation. The court questioned the neutrality of Parinya Nutalai, chair of the public hearing panel on the EGAT listing, because he was Vice Minister of Natural Resources and the Environment.\n\nIt also ruled that insufficient opportunities were given to EGAT employees to make themselves heard. There was only one public hearing for employees, which only 1,057 attended. Lastly, EGAT PLC continued to have the right to expropriate public land to build power plants and transmission lines, a right reserved for the state. Two decrees were nullified: one ordering the dissolution of the status of EGAT as a state enterprise, and the other serving as a new charter for EGAT PLC.\n\nUnion leaders and anti-Thaksin protesters cheered the ruling, and called for the renationalization of other privatized state enterprises, such as PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP) and Thai Airways International (both privatized in 1992), PTT PCL, TOT PCL, MCOT PCL, Thailand Post Co Ltd, and CAT Telecom PCL. Like EGAT, PTT also retained land expropriation rights after it was privatized. However, this was one of the grounds for the nullification of the EGAT privatization. Caretaker Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya has noted that the delisting and renationalization of PTT could force the government to borrow massively from foreign institutions.\n\nSome criticized that the listing of PTT on the SET on the grounds that it represented a massive transfer of public assets for the benefit of few people. Though the government initially accepted over 100,000 first-time investors, there were reports that the majority of the shares for sale to retail investors had been reserved for politicians, the banks' preferred clients, and journalists, leaving many retail investors, who stood in long lines to wait, to return home empty-handed. A nephew of Suriya Juengrungruangkit, the minister of Industry overseeing PTT and TRT Party secretary general, for example, was reported to have acquired 22 times the maximum number of PTT shares distributed to retail investors.\n\nFears of this being repeated were often cited as the reason why EGAT's privatization was delayed indefinitely. Another key argument for delaying privatization was that privatization preceded the establishment of an independent energy regulatory authority. In international experience, there are no examples of successful monopoly utility privatization without regulatory oversight. Under pressure, Thaksin's government formed an interim electricity regulatory body, but some charged that it lacked authority to force compliance, levy fines, or punish defaulters. EGAT employee concerns about employment security were also common. Some expressed concern that partial ownership of Thailand's largest electricity producer by foreign shareholders would impact national security and cause conflicts of interest.\n\nAnti-privatization petitioners (including the Confederation of Consumer Organisations, People Living with HIV/Aids, Alternative Energy Project for Sustainability, Free Trade Area Watch, and the Four Region Slum Network) were harshly criticized by both Thai and international investors, who accused them of using corrupt tactics in delaying the listing. They also pointed to the public mandate of the 2005 election, during which the only anti-privatization party suffered a near complete loss. International power sector governance experts from Harvard University, University of Delaware, and the World Resources Institute lauded the successful repeal of EGAT privatization as an important step towards increased accountability and transparency in the Thai energy industry.\n\n\nSecurity Assessment, 2016]\n"}

{"id": "3177830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3177830", "title": "Fireless locomotive", "text": "Fireless locomotive\n\nA fireless locomotive is a type of locomotive which uses reciprocating engines powered from a reservoir of compressed air or steam, which is filled at intervals from an external source. They offer advantages over conventional steam locomotives of lower cost per unit, cleanliness, and decreased risk from fire or boiler explosion; these are counterbalanced by the need for a source to refill the locomotive, and by the limited range afforded by the reservoir.\n\nTypical usage was in industrial switching where a conventional locomotive was too noxious or risky, such as in a mine or a food or chemical factory; they also saw use where the source of air or steam was readily available.\n\nThey were eventually displaced by diesel and battery electric locomotives fitted with protective appliances; these are described as flame-proof locomotives.\n\nAn early application of the fireless locomotive was to street tramways in the USA. Emile Lamm developed two types of fireless locomotive, one using ammonia and the other using stored steam. Lamm founded two companies, \"Ammonia & Thermo-Specific Propelling Company of America\" in 1872 and (with Sylvester L. Langdon) \"Lamm Fireless Engine Company\" in 1874. Lamm's fireless engines were briefly popular, both in the USA and in France, but were soon displaced by electric trams. The French locomotives were built in association with , under the name \"Lamm & Francq\".\n\nThe fireless system then gained a new lease of life for industrial shunting locomotives. Any factory which possessed a stationary boiler could use it to charge a fireless steam locomotive for internal shunting operations. Fireless shunting locomotives became especially popular in Germany and some remained in service into the 1960s. Fireless industrial shunters were usually of the 0-4-0 or 0-6-0 wheel arrangement but some 0-8-0s were built, by companies including Heisler. Pennsylvania Power and Light \"D\", in the gallery below, is an example of an 0-8-0 fireless Heisler locomotive.\n\nThe Swiss company, DLM, was recently (2012) trying to promote the fireless steam locomotive as an environmentally-friendly alternative to the diesel locomotive for shunting. DLM claims that diesel shunters typically spend 75% of their working time with the engine idling.\n\nA fireless steam locomotive is similar to a conventional steam locomotive, but has a reservoir, known as a steam accumulator, instead of a boiler. This reservoir is charged with superheated water under pressure from a stationary boiler. The engine works like a conventional steam engine using the high pressure steam above the water in the accumulator. As the steam is used and pressure drops, the superheated water boils, replacing the used steam. The locomotive can work like this until the pressure has dropped to a minimum useful level or the water runs out, after which it must be recharged.\n\nEuropean fireless steam locomotives usually have the cylinders at the back, while American ones often have the cylinders at the front, as in a conventional locomotive. Major builders of fireless steam locomotives in the UK included Andrew Barclay and W.G. Bagnall.\n\nThe first locomotive to run on compressed air was built in 1890, and by 1895, the basic principles of efficient compressed air engines had been developed. A particularly important engineering breakthrough was the development of the reducing and stop valve which maintains a uniform pressure of air to the engine, even as the pressure in the storage tank reduces with use. Compressed air locomotives have been used for many years, mainly in mines, but have also been used on tramways. (See Mekarski system)\n\nSeveral hybrid locomotives have been built that have either used a fire for part of the time, e.g., Fowler's Ghost of London's Metropolitan in 1861, or have used a fire to superheat stored steam, such as the Receiver Locomotives built by Sentinel Waggon Works. None has been a success.\n\nMost fireless locomotives have been of 0-4-0 or 0-6-0 wheel arrangement but there have been some 0-8-0 and even a few 0-10-0. Some gauge 0-10-0 fireless locomotives from the German company Henschel were used in the construction of the Baghdad Railway, probably to avoid the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning during the boring of tunnels.\n\nAnother German company, Hohenzollern, built some articulated fireless steam locomotives with a cab at each end. Only one of the bogies was powered, making the wheel arrangement B-2.\n\nSteam traction became obsolete in the 1940s and was largely replaced by diesel or electric traction. However, fireless steam has its merits, especially where there is an abundant cheap source of steam, such as in industrial sites, at thermal power stations or refuse incineration plants, where fireless steam locomotives are used for shunting at very low cost.\n\nAs they do not emit any exhaust except steam, they can shunt into buildings without endangering the workforce with noxious fumes.\n\nConsidering that shunting locomotives are typically working for only about 10% of the time, 90% waiting for work; a diesel locomotive, idling most of the time, burns too much fuel producing nothing. A well insulated modern steam accumulator can preserve pressure over many hours. Thus the operating cost of a fireless steam shunter can be far less than that of a comparable diesel.\n\nFireless locomotives are also safer to operate than conventional steam locomotives, aside from the elimination of ignition hazards. The primary cause of a locomotive boiler explosion is the depletion of boiler water, through inattention or excessive use, exposing the crown sheet directly to the flames of the firebox without the cooling effect of the water covering, weakening it to the point of failure. A fireless locomotive eliminates this danger—if it runs out of sufficient water, it simply ceases to move—although precautions must be taken as with any other pressure vessel. Furthermore, they did not require careful monitoring of water levels and boiler pressure, nor careful distribution of coal in the firebox for efficient combustion, and thus could be operated by less-skilled staff, not requiring a fully qualified locomotive engineer and fireman.\n\nSeveral locomotive builders produced fireless engines throughout the 20th century. Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works was still building them in the 1980s. Some fireless locomotives are in daily use even in 2016. One example is the large coal-fired power station in Mannheim where coal is delivered by rail in long trains of self-discharging hopper wagons. Three fireless engines are used to shunt the hoppers on the premises of the power station.\n\nEast Germany, preferring to use its abundant supply of lignite to imported fuel, used fireless engines extensively. A series of 200 fireless locomotives was built at Raw Meiningen as late as the 1980s.\n\nThere are two places in Indonesia where fireless locomotives can be found in working condition. \nThe first one is Semboro sugar mill in Jember , East Java. Their presence is needed due to risk of fire posed by flammable materials like sugarcane bagasse. Both locos were built by Orenstein & Koppel in Germany in 1928 and 1929 respectively. As in 2017, both locos are still used for shunting inside the mill's complex. \nThe second one is Pagottan sugar mill in Madiun, also in East Java. These Luttermöller axle locomotives, numbered 6, 7 and 8, were originally conventional steam locomotives who feature fireboxes. Due to closure of field lines, as well as money saving measure by mill's management, they were converted to fireless configuration in 2011.\n\nSwitzerland had used older fireless engines in industry, such as breweries. In 2010, the steam company Dampflokomotiv- und Maschinenfabrik DLM refurbished two locomotives of the German \"Meiningen\" type and modernised them for use on sidings.\nNumerous examples have been preserved across the world.\n\nThe German Wikipedia has a list of steam accumulator locomotives preserved in that country.\nIt includes over 100 preserved fireless engines, 8 of them operational.\n\nThe Mexico City railroad museum has a fireless steam locomotive Davenport no. 013 \"Sin Fuego\". It was a donated by Pemex and operated from 1940s – 1990s at the 18 de marzo refinery.\n\nThe Electricity Supply Commission of South Africa (ESKOM) has preserved two fireless steam locomotives. They are Bagnall 0-6-0F no. 2571 of 1937 and Hawthorne Leslie 0-4-0F no. 3858 of 1935.\n\nOne notable example is \"Lord Ashfield\" (Andrew Barclay works no. 1989 of 1930) at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester. It ran in limited service in the 1990s sharing a steam supply with the stationary exhibits.\n\nThe Ayrshire Railway Preservation Group has rebuilt its Andrew Barclay 0-4-0 fireless locomotive (Works Number 1952 of 1928). The engine returned to service in 2015, and operates as part of a demonstration freight train. \n\nThe North Carolina Transportation Museum in Spencer has a fireless steam locomotive, the North Carolina Power and Light #3 0-4-0.\n\nThree National Cash Register 0-4-0 fireless switchers have been preserved: one at Carillon Historical Park in Dayton, Ohio, one at the Southeastern Railway Museum in Duluth, Georgia, and one at the National Museum of Transportation in Kirkwood, Missouri.\n\nPennsylvania Power and Light \"D\", an 0-8-0 switcher, is preserved in the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.\n\nUnion Electric Company 4, a 0-4-0 is preserved in the Illinois Railway Museum of Union Illinois.\n\nCleveland Electric Illuminating Company, an 0-6-0 built by the H.K.

This rare fireless locomotive was built in 1936 for the North American Rayon Company(N.A.R.C.) of Elizabethton, Tennessee. Its steam was supplied from a large reservoir located inside of the N.A.R.C. plant. Fireless locomotives were used in industrial situations where there was an increased risk of fire. N.A.R.C. made Rayon, which is a highly flammable material. The locomotive retired from service in 1992 and it is possibly the last fireless locomotive to be retired from service in the USA.

It has played an important role in sculpting many landscapes. Most lakes in the world occupy basins scoured out by glaciers. Glacial motion can be fast (up to 30 m/day, observed on Jakobshavn Isbræ in Greenland) or slow (0.5 m/year on small glaciers or in the center of ice sheets), but is typically around 1 metre/day.\n\nGlacier motion occurs from four processes, all driven by gravity: basal sliding, glacial quakes generating fractional movements of large sections of ice, bed deformation, and internal deformation.\n\nIf a glacier's terminus moves forward faster than it melts, the net result is advance. Glacier retreat occurs when more material ablates from the terminus than is replenished by flow into that region.\n\nGlaciologists consider that trends in mass balance for glaciers are more fundamental than the advance or retreat of the termini of individual glaciers. In the years since 1960, there has been a striking decline in the overall volume of glaciers worldwide. This decline is correlated with global warming. As a glacier thins, due to the loss of mass it will slow down and crevassing will decrease.\n\nStudying glacial motion and the landforms that result requires tools from many different disciplines: physical geography, climatology, and geology are among the areas sometime grouped together and called earth science.\n\nDuring the Pleistocene (the last ice age), huge sheets of ice called continental glaciers advanced over much of the earth. The movement of these continental glaciers created many now-familiar glacial landforms. As the glaciers were expanded, due to their accumulating weight of snow and ice, they crushed and redistributed surface rocks, creating erosional landforms such as s, cirques, and hanging valleys. Later, when the glaciers retreated leaving behind their freight of crushed rock and sand, depositional landforms were created, such as moraines, eskers, drumlins, and kames. The stone walls found in New England (northeastern United States) contain many glacial erratics, rocks that were dragged by a glacier many miles from their bedrock origin.\n\nAt some point, if an Alpine glacier becomes too thin it will stop moving. This will result in the end of any basal erosion. The stream issuing from the glacier will then become clearer as glacial flour diminishes. Lakes and ponds can also be caused by glacial movement. Kettle lakes form when a retreating glacier leaves behind an underground chunk of ice. Moraine-dammed lakes occur when a stream (or snow runoff) is dammed by glacial till.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40628008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40628008", "title": "Guevarism", "text": "Guevarism\n\nGuevarism is a theory of communist revolution and a military strategy of guerilla warfare associated with Marxist revolutionary Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, a leading figure of the Cuban Revolution who believed in the idea of Marxism–Leninism and embraced its principles.\n\nAfter the 1959 triumph of the Cuban insurrection led by a militant foco under Fidel Castro, his Argentine-born, cosmopolitan and Marxist colleague, Guevara parlayed his ideology and experiences into a model for emulation (and at times, direct military intervention) around the globe. While exporting one such \"focalist\" revolution to Bolivia, leading an armed vanguard party there in October 1967, Guevara was captured and executed, becoming a martyr to both the world communist movement and socialism in general.\n\nHis ideology promotes exporting revolution to any country whose leader is supported by the empire (United States) and has fallen out of favor with its citizens. Guevara talks about how constant guerrilla warfare taking place in non-urban areas can overcome leaders. He introduces three points that are representative of his ideology as a whole, namely that the people can win with proper organization against a nation's army; that the conditions that make a revolution possible can be put in place by the popular forces; and that the popular forces always have an advantage in a non urban setting.\n\nGuevara had a particularly keen interest in guerrilla warfare, with a dedication to foco techniques, also known as focalism (or \"foquismo\" in Spanish), which is vanguardism by small armed units, frequently in place of established Communist Parties, initially launching attacks from rural areas to mobilize unrest into a popular front against a sitting regime. Despite differences in approach—emphasizing guerrilla leadership and audacious raids that engender general uprising, rather than consolidating political power in military strongholds before expanding to new ones—Guevara took great inspiration from the Maoist notion of \"protracted people's war\" and sympathized with Mao Zedong's People's Republic of China in the Sino-Soviet split. This controversy may partly explain his departure from Castro's pro-Soviet Cuba in the mid-1960s. Guevara also drew direct parallels with his contemporary Communist comrades in the Viet Cong, exhorting a multi-front guerrilla strategy to create \"two, three, many Vietnams\".\n\nIn Guevara's final years, after leaving Cuba he advised Communist paramilitary movements in Africa and Latin America, including a young Laurent-Désiré Kabila, future ruler of Zaire/Democratic Republic of the Congo. Finally, while leading a small focalist band of guerrilla cadres in Bolivia, Guevara was captured and killed. His death and the short-term failure of his Guevarist tactics may have interrupted the component guerrilla wars within the larger Cold War for a time and even temporarily discouraged Soviet and Cuban sponsorship for focalism.\n\nThe emerging Communist movements and other fellow traveler radicalism of the time either switched to urban guerrilla warfare before the end of the 1960s and/or soon revived the rural-based strategies of both Maoism and Guevarism, tendencies that escalated worldwide throughout the 1970s, by and large with the support from the Communist states and the Soviet Union in general as well as Castro's Cuba in particular.\n\nAnother proponent of Guevarism was the French intellectual Régis Debray, who could be seen as attempting to establish a coherent, unitary theoretical framework on these grounds. Debray has since broken with this.\n\nGuevarism has been criticized from a revolutionary anarchist perspective by Abraham Guillén, one of the leading tacticians of urban guerrilla warfare in Uruguay and Brazil. Guillen claimed that cities are a better ground for the guerrilla than the countryside (Guillen was a veteran of the Spanish Civil War). He criticized Guevarist movements of national liberation (like the Uruguayan Tupamaros, one of the many groups that he helped as a military advisor) for trying to impose a dictatorship instead of self-management.\n\n"}
{"id": "8243937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8243937", "title": "Humboldtian science", "text": "Humboldtian science\n\nHumboldtian science refers to a movement in science in the 19th century closely connected to the work and writings of German scientist, naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt. It maintained a certain ethics of precision and observation, which combined scientific field work with the sensitivity and aesthetic ideals of the age of Romanticism. Like Romanticism in science, it was rather popular in the 19th century. The term was coined by Susan Faye Cannon in 1978.\nThe example of Humboldt's life and his writings allowed him to reach out beyond the academic community with his natural history and address a wider audience with popular science aspects. It has supplanted the older Baconian method, related as well to a single person, Francis Bacon.\n\nHumboldt was born in Berlin in 1769 and worked as a Prussian mining official in the 1790s until 1797 when he quit and began collecting scientific knowledge and equipment. His extensive wealth aided his infatuation with the spirit of Romanticism; he amassed an extensive collection of scientific instruments and tools as well as a sizeable library. In 1799 Humboldt, under the protection of King Charles IV of Spain, left for South America and New Spain, toting all of his tools and books. The purpose of the voyage was steeped in Romanticism; Humboldt intended to investigate how the forces of nature interact with one another and find out about the unity of nature. Humboldt returned to Europe in 1804 and was acclaimed as a public hero. The details and findings of Humboldt's journey were published in his \"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equatorial Regions of the New Continent\" (30 volumes). This \"Personal Narrative\" was taken by Charles Darwin on his famous voyage on H.M.S Beagle. Humboldt spent the rest of his life mainly in Europe, although he did embark on a short expedition to Siberia and the Russian steppes in 1829. Humboldt's last works were contained in his book, \"\" (\"Cosmos. Sketch for a Physical Description of the Universe\"). The book mainly described the development of a life-force from the cosmos, but also included the formation of stars from nebular clouds as well as the geography of planets. Alexander von Humboldt died in 1859, while working on the fifth volume of \"Kosmos\".\nThrough his travels to South America and his observational records in \"An Essay on the Geography of Plants\" as well as \"Kosmos\", an important trend emerged through his techniques of observation, scientific instruments used and unique perspective on nature. Humboldt's novel style has been defined as Humboldtian Science. Humboldt had the ability to combine the study of empirical data with a holistic view of nature and its aesthetically pleasing characteristics, which is now held to be the true definition of the study of vegetation and plant geography. Humboldtian science is one of the first techniques for studying both organic and inorganic branches of science. Examining the interconnectedness of vegetation and its respective environment is one of the new and important aspects of Humboldt's work, an idea labeled as \"terrestrial physics,\" something that scientists who preceded him, such as Linnaeus, failed to do. Humboldtian science is founded on a principle of \"general equilibrium of forces.\" General equilibrium was the idea that there are infinite forces in nature that are in constant conflict, yet all forces balance each other out.\nHumboldt laid the groundwork for future scientific endeavors by establishing the importance of studying organisms and their environment in conjunction .\n\nHumboldtian science includes both the extensive work of Alexander von Humboldt, as well as many of the works of 19th century scientists. Susan Cannon is attributed with coining the term \"Humboldtian science\". According to Cannon, Humboldtian science is, \"the accurate, measured study of widespread but interconnected real phenomena in order to find a definite law and a dynamical cause.\" Humboldtian science is used now in place of the traditional, \"Baconianism,\" as a more appropriate and less vague term for the themes of 19th century science.\n\nNatural history in the eighteenth century was the \"nomination of the visible\". Carl Linnaeus was preoccupied with fitting all nature into taxonomy, fixated on only what was visible. Towards the turn of the nineteenth century, Immanuel Kant became interested in understanding where species derived from, and was less concerned with an organism's physical attributes. Next, Johann Reinhold Forster, one of Humboldt's future partners, became interested in the study of vegetation as an essential way of understanding nature and its relationship with human society. Proceeding Forster, Karl Willdenow examined floristic plant geography, the distribution of plants and regionality as a whole. All of these pieces in the history before Humboldt help to shape what is defined as Humboldtian science. Humboldt took into account both the outward appearance and inward meaning of plant species. His attention to natural aesthetics and empirical data and evidence is what set his scientific work apart from ecologists before him. Malcolm so aptly puts it as; \"Humboldt effortlessly combined a commitment to empiricism and the experimental elucidation of the laws of nature with an equally strong commitment to holism and to a view of nature which was intended to be aesthetically and spiritually satisfactory\". It was through this holistic approach to science and the study of nature that Humboldt was able to find a web of interconnectedness despite a multitude of extensive differences between different species of organisms.\n\nAccording to Malcolm Nicholson, \"Susan Cannon characterized Humboldtian science as synthetic, empirical, quantitative and impossible to fit into any one of our twentieth century disciplinary boundaries.\" A central element of Humboldtian science was its use of the latest advances in scientific instrumentation to observe and measure physical variables, while attending to all possible sources of error. Humboldtian science revolved around understanding the relationship between accurate measurement, sources of error and mathematical laws. Cannon identifies four distinctive features that marked Humboldtian science out from previous versions of science:\n\nHumboldt was committed to what he called 'terrestrial physics.' Essentially Humboldt's new scientific approach required a new type of scientist: Humboldtian science demanded a transition from the naturalist to the physicist. Humboldt described how his idea of terrestrial physics differs from traditional \"descriptive\" natural history when he stated, \"[traveling naturalists] have neglected to track the great and constant laws of nature manifested in the rapid flux of phenomena…and to trace the reciprocal interaction of the divided physical forces.\" Humboldt did not consider himself an explorer, but rather a scientific traveler, who accurately measured what explorers had reported inaccurately. According to Humboldt, the goal of the terrestrial physicist was to investigate the confluence and interweaving of all physical forces. An incredibly extensive array of precise instrumentation had to be readily available for Humboldt's terrestrial physicist. The expansive amount of scientific resources that characterized the Humboldtian scientist is best described in the book \"Science in Culture\",\n\nThus the complete Humboldtian traveller, in order to make satisfactory observations, should be able to cope with everything from the revolution of the satellites of Jupiter to the carelessness of clumsy donkeys.\n\nJust some of such instruments included chronometers, telescopes, sextants, microscopes, magnetic compasses, thermometers, hygrometers, barometers, electrometers, and eudiometers. Furthermore, it was necessary to have multiple makes and models of each specific instrument to compare errors and constancy among each type.\n\nOne concept that is central to Humboldtian science is that of a general equilibrium of forces. Humboldt explains: \"The general equilibrium which reigns amongst disturbances and apparent turmoil, is the result of infinite number of mechanical forces and chemical attractions balancing each other out.\" Equilibrium is derived from an infinite number of forces acting simultaneously and varying globally. In other words, the lawfulness of nature, according to Humboldt, is a result of infinity and complexity. Humboldtian science promotes the idea that the more forces that are accurately measured over more of the earth's surface results in a greater understanding of the order of nature.\n\nThe voyage to the Americas produced many discoveries and developments that help to illustrate Humboldt's ideas about this equilibrium of forces. Humboldt produced the \"Tableau physique des Andes\" (\"Physical Profile of the Andes), which aimed at capturing his voyage to the America's in a single graphic table. Humboldt meant to capture all of the physical forces, from organisms to electricity, in this single table. Among many other complex empirical recordings of elevation-specific data, the table included a detailed biodistribution. This biodistribution mapped the specific distributions of flora and fauna at every elevation level on the mountain.\n\nHumboldt's study of plants provides an example of the movement of Humboldtian science away from traditional science. Humboldt's botany also further illustrates the concept of equilibrium and the Humboldtian ideas of the interrelationship of nature's elements. Although he was concerned with physical features of plants, he was largely focused on the investigation of underlying connections and relations among plant organisms. Humboldt worked for years on developing an understanding of plant distributions and geography. The link between the balancing equilibrium of natural forces and organism distribution is evident when Humboldt states:\n\nAs in all other phenomena of the physical universe, so in the distribution of organic beings: amidst the apparent disorder which seems to result from the influence of a multitude of local causes, the unchanging law of nature become evident as soon as one surveys an extensive territory, or uses a mass of facts in which the partial disturbances compensate one another.\n\nThe study of vegetation and plant geography arose out of new concerns that emerged with Humboldtian science. These new areas of concern in science included integrative processes, invisible connections, historical development, and natural wholes.\n\nHumboldtian science applied the idea of general equilibrium of forces to the continuities in the history of the generation of the planet. Humboldt saw the history of the earth as a continuous global distribution of such things as heat, vegetation, and rock formations. In order to graphically represent this continuity Humboldt developed isothermal lines. These isothermal lines functioned in the general balancing of forces in that isothermal lines preserved local peculiarities within a general regularity. According to Humboldtian science, nature's order and equilibrium emerged \"gradually and progressively from laborious observing, averaging, and mapping over increasingly extended areas.\"\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson once dubbed Humboldt to be \"one of those wonders of the world… who appear from time to time, as if to show us the possibilities of the human mind.\" \n\nWhen Humboldt first began his studies of organisms and the environment he claimed that he wanted to \"reorganize the general connections that link organic beings and to study the great harmonies of Nature\". He is often considered one of the world's first genuine ecologists. Humboldt succeeded in developing a comprehensive science that joined the separate branches of natural philosophy under a model of natural order founded on the concept of dynamic equilibrium. Humboldt's work reached far beyond his personal expeditions and discoveries. Figures from all across the globe participated on his work. Some such participants included French naval officers, East India Company physicians, Russian provincial administrators, Spanish military commanders, and German diplomats. Furthermore, as was aforementioned, Charles Darwin carried a copy of Humboldt's \"Personal Narrative\" aboard H.M.S. Beagle. Humboldt's projects, particularly those related to natural philosophy, played a significant role in the influx of European money and travelers to Spanish America in increasing numbers in the early 19th century. Sir Edward Sabine, a British scientist, worked on terrestrial magnetism in a manner that was certainly Humboldtian. Also, British scientist George Gabriel Stokes depended heavily on abstract mathematical measurement to deal with error in a precision instrument; certainly Humboldtian science. Maybe the most prominent figure whose work can be considered representative of Humboldtian science, is geologist Charles Lyell. Despite a lack of emphasis on precise measurement in geology at the time, Lyell insisted on precision in a Humboldtian manner.\n\nThe promotion and development of terrestrial physics under Humboldtian science produced not only useful maps and statistics, but offered both European and Creole societies tools for essentially 're-imaging' America. The lasting impact of Humboldtian science is described in \"Cultures of Natural History\", \"Humboldtian science illuminates the reorganization of knowledge and disciplines in the early nineteenth century that defined the emergence of natural history out of natural philosophy.\"\n\n\n"}

On a lake, pond, or other stationary body of water, ice forms undisturbed and generally does not move as long as the entire surface of the body of water is frozen. When a river freezes, water flow typically continues beneath the ice, exerting pressure on it. If the ice fractures, pieces of ice torn free by the river's current will collide with stationary or slower-moving pieces. After becoming stuck in place, the loosened pieces of ice refreeze irregularly, causing a rough, or \"jumbled\", surface.\n\nIn general, the faster a body of water flows beneath ice, the more likely it is to develop jumble ice. Temperatures near the freezing point also tend to cause jumble ice, as the higher temperatures weaken the ice structure, allowing for more pieces to be torn free before refreezing. The Yukon River in Alaska often exhibits jumble ice during the winter.\n\nJumble ice is a hazard for winter travelers, as the broken \"ground\" formed by the jumble ice can cause snowmachine accidents or injuries to sled dogs.\n\n\n\n"}

Its end is defined at the end of the Younger Dryas, some 11,700 years ago. The age represents the end of the Pleistocene epoch and is followed by the Holocene epoch.\n\nMuch of the Late Pleistocene age was dominated by glaciations, such as the Wisconsin glaciation in North America and the Weichselian glaciation and Würm glaciation in Eurasia). Many megafauna became extinct during this age, a trend that continued into the Holocene. The Late Pleistocene contains the Upper Paleolithic stage of human development, including the out-of-Africa migration and dispersal of anatomically modern humans and the extinction of the last remaining archaic human species.\n\nAccording to George Carr Frison, \"Bison occidentalis\" and \"Bison antiquus\", an extinct subspecies of the smaller present-day bison, survived the Late Pleistocene period, between about 12 and 11 ka ago. Plains and Rocky Mountain First Nations depended on these bison as their major food source. Earlier kills of camels, horses, and muskoxen found at Wally's beach were dated to 13.1–13.3 ka B.P.\n\n"}

While the episcopal seats from Byzantine times only remaining ruins, inhabited and used monasteries and churches are still present at this time at Olympus. Some of the monasteries are a stauropegion, ie they are directly subordinate to the Patriarch of Constantinople (Istanbul), others belong to a diocese. The number of churches and chapels around Mount Olympus is hard to overlook. That is why only the monasteries and most important churches are mentioned.\n\nOn his journey from Jerusalem to Corinth, in the first half of the 1st century, the apostle Paul also visited the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki. His 1st Letter to the Thessalonians is one of the oldest writings of Christendom. Paul founded Christian communities, among others in Macedonia and Greece. In the 4th century Dion became the first bishopric of the region.\n\nThe basilica of the bishop was built in two phases. It was started in the 4th century. After being destroyed by an earthquake, it was completed in the 5th century. It was a three-nave church with narthex. A smaller building, west of the church, served as a baptistery.\n\nThis fortress-like episcopal seat was built in the last quarter of the 5th century. It is probably the same place that was called Anamon in Roman records. In the middle of the 6th century, the buildings were destroyed by an earthquake. The bishop left the place and it was used in the subsequent period as a cemetery.\n\nRemains of two 4th-century and 6th-century basilicas were discovered at Pydna. The younger of the two basilicas was burned down by Bulgars after the conquest of Pydna. At the end of the 10th century, a 23 by 17 meters large basilica was built on their instead. In 1204, Frankish knights, probably after a siege, conquered the place and destroyed it. The remains of the basilica were turned into a fortress.\n\nIn 1055 the monks Joakim and Daniamos founded a monastery on the south side of Mount Olympus, located above the river Ziliana. The French archaeologist Heuzey dated the founding of the monastery to the year 955. After the monks abandoned the monastery at the beginning of the 20th century, it is now inhabited by nuns.\n\nIn the 11th century, the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin (Isodion tis Theotoko) was built in Petra. Today there is a sanatorium in this place.\n\nAt least since the year 1386 the existence of the monastery is documented. After being abandoned at the beginning of the 20th century, it has been inhabited by monks for several years now.\n\nThe exact date of the construction of this church is unknown. The kind of the construction and the decoration inside the church point to the 7th century. It is interesting that obviously building material from the nearby Dion was used.\n\nIn 1542 the monastery was founded by Saint Dionysius and dedicated to the Holy Trinity. During its history, the monastery was destroyed and rebuilt several times. In April 1943 it was blown up by the German Wehrmacht. The monks left the monastery and retreated to the Metochi founded in 1650, which gradually became the new monastery of Agios Dionysios.\n\nThe chapel was founded in the 16th century by Saint Dionysius, who probably lived there for a time. It stands on the top of Mount Profitis Elias, one of the peaks of Olympus, at an altitude of 2803 meters. It is thus the highest chapel of the Orthodox Church at all. The chapel was built over ancient ruins.\n\nAbout 7 kilometers north of the town of Karya in 1640 the monastery of Agia Triada (Holy Trinity) was built. It was located at an altitude of 1320 meters and was also known by the name monastery Klymendou or simply as an old monastery (Palaiomonastirio). In 1823 it was partially burned down by the Ottomans, in 1833 one of the monks caused a fire that completely destroyed the monastery. Since 1913, a chapel stands at that place.\n\nNortheast of the town of Ritini lies the monastery of St. George. The oldest paintings of the monastery were dated to the year 1494. One of these frescoes shows St. George riding a dragon, another shows Jesus Christ on the cross. The other frescoes of the Katholikon date back to 1619. During World War II the monastery was abandoned.\n\nAt the northern end of the village of Ano Skotina is the church of Agios Athanasios. The main part of the church and the narthex dates back to 1656, the other parts of the building were added later. The church is known for its frescoes.\n\nThe monastery is located on a hill, 1.5 kilometers north of Kontariotissa. The foundation was in 1983, the nuns inhabited monastery is under the diocese of Kitros-Katerini.\n\nThe convent to the Blessed Virgin located east of Rapsani was founded in 1997.\n"}

In the story of the drowning of Ys, a city in Brittany, the king's daughter Dahut is the cause, and she becomes a sea morgen.\n\nThe morgens are eternally young, and like sirens they sit in the water and comb their hair seductively. In Arthurian legend, particularly Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Vita Merlini\", the ruler of Avalon is referred to as \"Morgen\". As such, the origin of Morgan le Fay may be connected to these Breton myths.\n\nTales of morgens are preserved in the British countryside, even in some parts of South West England.

{"id": "57366105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57366105", "title": "Mount Cayley massif", "text": "Mount Cayley massif\n\nThe Mount Cayley massif is a group of mountains in the Pacific Ranges of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Located north of Squamish and west of Whistler, the massif resides on the edge of the Powder Mountain Icefield. It consists of an eroded but potentially active stratovolcano that towers over the Cheakamus and Squamish river valleys. All major summits have elevations greater than , Mount Cayley being the highest at . The surrounding area has been inhabited by indigenous peoples for more than 7,000 years while geothermal exploration has taken place there for the last four decades.\n\nPart of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, the Mount Cayley massif was formed by subduction zone volcanism along the western margin of North America. Eruptive activity began about 4,000,000 years ago and has since undergone three stages of growth, the first two of which built most of the massif. The latest eruptive period occurred sometime in the last 400,000 years with lesser activity continuing into the present day.\n\nFuture eruptions are likely to threaten neighbouring communities with pyroclastic flows, lahars (volcanically induced mudslides, landslides and debris flows) and floods. To monitor this threat, the volcano and its surroundings are monitored by the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC). Eruption impact would be largely a result of the concentration of vulnerable infrastructure in nearby valleys.\n\nThe massif resides in the middle of a north–south trending zone of volcanism called the Mount Cayley volcanic field. It consists predominantly of volcanoes that formed subglacially during the Late Pleistocene age, such as Pali Dome, Slag Hill, Ring Mountain and Ember Ridge, but activity continued at Pali Dome and Slag Hill into the Holocene epoch. The Mount Cayley volcanic field is part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, which in turn represents a northern extension of the Cascade Volcanic Arc. Volcanism of the Cascade Arc is largely a result of the Juan de Fuca Plate sliding under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone.\n\nThree main summits comprise the Mount Cayley massif. The highest and northernmost is Mount Cayley with an elevation of . Its northeastern flank abuts the southern end of the Powder Mountain Icefield. This is a long and wide irregularly-shaped glacier that trends slightly to the northwest. Just southwest of Mount Cayley lies Pyroclastic Peak, in elevation. It contains a jagged summit ridge of many slender rock pinnacles, the largest of which is known as the Vulcan's Thumb. Wizard Peak with an elevation of is east of Pyroclastic Peak and is the lowest of the three main summits.\n\nAs a stratovolcano, the Mount Cayley massif is built up of solidified lava and ash from successive volcanic eruptions. It is predominantly dacitic in composition, although rhyodacite is also common. Its original and current volumes remain uncertain. It may have had a volume as large as , but erosion has since reduced it to glacially eroded crags. The modern volcano has an estimated volume of and is only a modest fraction of its total output of silicic eruptive products. It has a proximal relief of and a draping relief of , with a nearly vertical cliff more than high immediately above the Turbid Creek valley. Turbid Creek, Dusty Creek, Avalanche Creek and Shovelnose Creek flow from the slopes of the Mount Cayley massif.\n\nDeep seismic profiling below the massif has identified a large bright spot, a reflector interpreted to be a mid-crustal magma chamber or body of very hot rock. Similar mid-crustal reflectors have been identified under subduction zone volcanoes in Japan.\n\nThe Mount Cayley massif has experienced volcanic eruptions sporadically for the last 4,000,000 years, making it one of the most persistent eruptive centres in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. Three primary eruptive stages in the history of the massif have been identified. The Mount Cayley and Vulcan's Thumb stages occurred between 4,000,000 and 600,000 years ago with the construction of the stratovolcano and plug domes. A 300,000-year-long period of quiescence followed, during which prolonged erosion destroyed much of the original volcanic structure. This was followed by the third and final Shovelnose stage about 300,000 to 200,000 years ago with the emplacement of parasitic lava domes and flows. Although one of the Shovelnose domes has been potassium-argon dated at 310,000 years old, this date may be in error from excess argon. The Shovelnose stage rocks could be much younger, perhaps less than 15,000 years old.\n\nEruptions during the three stages produced volcanic rocks of felsic and intermediate compositions, including andesite, dacite and rhyodacite. The lack of evidence for volcano-ice interactions at the Mount Cayley massif implies that all eruptive stages most likely took place prior to glacial periods. This contrasts with many neighbouring volcanoes, which contain abundant volcanic glass and fine-scale columnar jointing from contact with ice during eruptions.\n\nInitial volcanic activity of the Mount Cayley massif 4,000,000 years ago corresponded with changes to the regional plate tectonics. This involved the separation of the Explorer and Juan de Fuca plates off the British Columbia Coast, which had some significant ramifications for regional geologic evolution. After this reorganization ceased, volcanism shifted westward from the Pemberton Volcanic Belt to establish the younger and currently active Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. The westward shift in volcanism may have been related to steepening of the Juan de Fuca slab after the formation of the Explorer Plate.\n\nThe early Mount Cayley stage was characterized by the eruption of felsic lava flows and pyroclastic rocks onto a crystalline basement. Initial volcanism formed a southwesterly-dipping prism of dacite flows and tephra cut by several dikes and sills. These rocks have been hydrothermally altered to varying degrees and are light yellow or red in colour. They are well exposed in the prominent southwestern cliffs of the massif.\n\nSubsequent activity deposited a series of massive dacite flows up to thick, which form the summit and northern slope of Wizard Peak. The Mount Cayley stage culminated with the emplacement of a central plug dome that forms the narrow jagged summit ridge of Mount Cayley. This edifice consists of similar intrusive dacite.\n\nThe next eruptive period, the Vulcan's Thumb stage, built an edifice that grew upon the southwestern slope of the ancestral Mount Cayley stratovolcano. This began with the eruption of massive dacite flows and blocky agglutinated breccias onto basement and older volcanic rocks of the Mount Cayley stage. These rocks partially form a ridge south of Wizard Peak and comprise the prominent summit ridge pinnacles of Pyroclastic Peak, including the Vulcan's Thumb.\n\nLater activity produced an overlying wide and long southwest-trending lobe of unconsolidated or poorly consolidated tephra. The tephra consists of ash and lapilli-sized fragments that have been heavily eroded to form vertical cliffs and ridges. Volcanism also deposited a thick sequence of blocky dacitic tuff breccia between Wizard Peak and Mount Cayley.\n\nVolcanic activity of the final Shovelnose stage involved the eruption of two lava domes at the east and southeast margins of the Mount Cayley massif in the upper Shovelnose Creek valley. The southeast dacite dome forms high cliffs of small diameter columnar joints. It was the source of a long dacite flow that extends down the Shovelnose and Turbid creek valleys to near the Squamish River. The east lava dome was built upon blocky bedded tephra overlying basement rocks and consists of a steep-sided columnar jointed mass of dacite.\n\nAlthough the Mount Cayley massif is not known to have had historical volcanic eruptions, low-level activity has continued into recorded history. Shallow earthquakes have occurred in the vicinity since 1985 and the Shovelnose and Turbid creek valleys contain two and three hot springs, respectively. The GSC therefore considers the massif a potentially active volcano. Temperatures ranging from have been measured from the hot springs. \n\nThe existence of hot springs indicate that magmatic heat is still present. Extensive tufa and sinter deposits inhabit the main hot springs while bright red ferruginous ochre precipitates from several cold seeps in the vicinity. The springs are confined around dacite cupolas and dikes that were emplaced during the Vulcan's Thumb stage.\n\nBecause the Mount Cayley massif is rich in coarse proximal pyroclastic deposits, some of them hydrothermally altered, it is especially prone to slope failure and debris avalanches. At least three major debris avalanches have occurred from the western slope in the last 10,000 years, all of which blocked the Squamish River and formed temporary lakes upstream. The first and largest event about 4,800 years ago produced a debris fan exposed along the Squamish River. A thick sequence of silts, sands and pebbles interbedded in the debris fan suggests that it may be the product of two major, closely spaced, debris avalanches rather than a single event. Another large debris avalanche about 1,100 years ago deposited material immediately upstream of the mouth of Turbid Creek. The third event followed about 500 years ago with the deposition of two diamicton units along Turbid Creek and was the smallest of the three major prehistoric debris avalanches. A lack of organic and paleosol horizons between the two units implies that they most likely represent separate surges within the same debris avalanche event.\n\nAt least three smaller scale debris avalanches have occurred in historic time. A landslide occurred in 1963 with the failure of a large volcanic block consisting of poorly consolidated tuff breccia and columnar-jointed dacite. The mass slid into Dusty Creek where it quickly fragmented into an aggregate then travelled roughly downstream where it entered the broader flatter valley of Turbid Creek for an additional . Both creeks were blocked by the event, resulting in the creation of lakes that eventually overtopped and breached the landslide dam to produce floods and possibly debris flows which in turn swept down Turbid Creek far beyond the landslide terminus. In June 1984, a major rockslide and debris flow resulted from a collapse at the head of Avalanche Creek. The debris flow reached the mouth of Turbid Creek where it destroyed a logging road bridge and blocked the Squamish River, introducing massive quantities of sediment. The third event took place along Turbid Creek in June 2014 and involved a debris flow that removed part of the Squamish River Forest Service Road.\n\nThe area has been inhabited by First Nations for thousands of years. Both the Mount Cayley massif and The Black Tusk on the opposite side of the Cheakamus River valley are called \"tak'takmu'yin tl'a in7in'axa7en\" by the Squamish people. In their language it means \"Landing Place of the Thunderbird\". The Thunderbird is a legendary creature in North American indigenous peoples' history and culture. When the bird flaps its wings, thunder is created, and lightning originates from its eyes. The Mount Cayley massif and The Black Tusk are considered sacred to the Squamish people as they have played an important part of their history. Mountain bilberries, Canadian blueberries and oval-leaved blueberries, being a favored food of the Squamish people, were gathered in large berry fields on and near the massif. Glassy rhyodacite collected from small outcrops on the slopes have been found in goat hunting sites and the Elaho rockshelter which have been collectively dated around 8,000 to 100 years old. Cayley rhyodacite has only been found in the northern parts of the Squamish Nation territory.\nThere had been no first ascent of the massif until July 1928 when an Alpine Club of Canada party, consisting of mountaineers R. E. Knight, W. G. Wheatley, E. C. Brooks, T. Fyles and B. Clegg, climbed Mount Cayley. Fyles submitted the mountain name to the Government of British Columbia in September 1928 for Beverley Cochrane Cayley, a mountaineer and friend of those in the climbing expedition who had died in June that year. The name became official on April 2, 1929, and photographs of the peak were published with Fyles' description of first ascent in the 1931 Canadian Alpine Journal Vol XX.\n\nThe Mount Cayley massif has been investigated as a potential geothermal energy resource since at least the late 1970s. Geothermal exploration by Energy, Mines and Resources Canada commenced in 1977 with the drilling of two shallow boreholes on the west side of the massif for temperature observation. High geothermal gradients of 51 and 65 millikelvin per metre were obtained from this work. Further drilling on the east and west sides of the massif in 1980–1982 by Nevin Sadlier-Brown Goodbrand Limited on behalf of the GSC showed geothermal gradients ranging from 45 to 95 millikelvin per metre. In 2002, BC Hydro published a report identifying 16 prospective geothermal sites throughout British Columbia. They named the Mount Cayley massif as one of the six sites with the highest potential for commercial development. There is \"promising\" potential for a 100 megawatt geothermal power station at the volcano but the severe terrain makes development difficult and expensive. The heat source has also yet to be confirmed through deep drilling.\n\nThough the Mount Cayley massif is currently quiet, it still poses potential hazards to nearby towns as well as logging and recreational areas. GSC seismic data suggest that the volcano still contains magma, indicating possible future eruptive activity and associated volcanic hazards such as landslides. An eruption scenario for the volcano was organized by GSC scientists in 2000 to show how Western Canada is vulnerable to such an event. They based the scenario on past activity in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and involved both explosive and effusive activity. The scenario was published in 2003 as an article for \"Natural Hazards\", a Springer journal devoting on all aspects of natural hazards including risk management and the forecasting of catastrophic events.\n\nIf eruptive activity were to resume, scientists would likely be able to detect increased seismicity as magma makes its way through the crust. The abundance of seismic activity and the sensitivity of the existing Canadian National Seismograph Network in this area would alert the GSC and possibly trigger an expanded monitoring effort. As the magma nears the surface, the volcano would likely swell and the surface fracture, causing greatly increased vigour in the hot springs and the creation of new springs or fumaroles. Minor and possibly large landslides could occur and might temporarily block the Squamish River, as has happened in the past without earthquake shaking and intrusion-related deformation. Eventually the near-surface magma may cause phreatic explosions and debris flows. By this time Highway 99 would be closed, Squamish would be evacuated and Whistler would be at least considered for evacuation.\nIn the event of an explosive eruption, an ash plume could reach in height and may be maintained for 12 hours. Air traffic would be diverted from the area and all airports covered by the plume would be closed, notably those in Vancouver, Victoria, Kamloops, Prince George and Seattle. Above the vent area, material from the eruption plume would collapse to form pyroclastic flows and would flow east and west into the Squamish and Cheakamus valleys. These would rapidly melt snow and ice in the summit area, generating debris flows that could reach Squamish and Daisy Lake, damaging much infrastructure. Heavy ash falls would occur in the Vancouver area, the Fraser Valley, Bellingham, Kamloops, Whistler and Pemberton. The ash would damage power and communication lines and satellite dishes, as well as computer and other electrical equipment. Telephone, radio, cell phone and satellite communications would be cut off. Weak structures could collapse under the weight of the ash. The eruption plume would then spread to envelop most of the west coast from Seattle to Anchorage, causing all enclosed airports to be closed and all relevant flights to be diverted or cancelled. Eastward migration of the plume would disrupt air traffic across Canada from Alberta to Newfoundland and Labrador. Ash from further, minor explosive activity could continue to fall lightly but persistently in the Whistler–Pemberton area, followed by weeks of viscous lava dome growth punctuated by small explosions. The explosions would generate short-lived high plumes, small pyroclastic flows to the Squamish and Cheakamus valleys and ash plumes to the north and east.\n\nExplosions might cease and be replaced by slow, continuous growth of a lava dome in the new crater. Rain and seasonal snow melt would regularly remobilize the tephra into lahars and these would continue to threaten the Squamish and Cheakamus valleys. The solidifying, spreading lava could then generate rockfalls and form a voluminous talus apron into the Squamish valley. As the lava dome spreads, it would periodically undergo gravitational collapse to generate dense pyroclastic flows into the Squamish and Cheakamus valleys. Ash elutriated from the pyroclastic flows would form plumes up to high, again dropping ash onto Pemberton and Whistler and causing disruptions to local air traffic. Infrequently, the lava dome might produce small explosions, ash plumes and pyroclastic flows. Squamish would remain evacuated, Highway 99 would remain closed and unrepairable and travel between Whistler/Pemberton and Vancouver would be forced to go via a much longer route to the east.\n\nEruptive activity itself could go on for years, followed by years of declining secondary activity. The cooling lava would intermittently spall sections to produce pyroclastic flows. The fragmental material on the slopes and in valleys would be periodically remobilized into debris flows. Significant structural mitigation would have to be built to reclaim use of the Highway 99 corridor and Squamish area.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "285241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=285241", "title": "Phonolite", "text": "Phonolite\n\nPhonolite is an uncommon volcanic rock, of intermediate chemical composition between felsic and mafic, with texture ranging from aphanitic (fine-grain) to porphyritic (mixed fine- and coarse-grain).\n\nThe name phonolite comes from the Ancient Greek meaning \"sounding stone\" because of the metallic sound it produces if an unfractured plate is hit; hence the English name \"clinkstone\".\n\nUnusually, phonolite forms from magma with a relatively low silica content, generated by low degrees of partial melting (less than 10%) of highly aluminous rocks of the lower crust such as tonalite, monzonite and metamorphic rocks. Melting of such rocks to a very low degree promotes the liberation of aluminium, potassium, sodium and calcium by melting of feldspar, with some involvement of mafic minerals. Because the rock is silica-undersaturated, it has no quartz or other silica crystals, and is dominated by low-silica feldspathoid minerals more than feldspar minerals.\n\nA few geological processes and tectonic events can melt the necessary precursor rocks to form phonolite. These include intracontinental hotspot volcanism, such as may form above mantle plumes covered by thick continental crust. A-type granites and alkaline igneous provinces usually occur alongside phonolites. Low-degree partial melting of underplates of granitic material in collisional orogenic belts may also produce phonolites.\n\nPhonolite is a fine-grained equivalent of nepheline syenite. They are products of partial melting, are silica-undersaturated, and have feldspathoids in their normative mineralogy.\n\nMineral assemblages in phonolite occurrences are usually abundant feldspathoids (nepheline, sodalite, hauyne, leucite and analcite) and alkali feldspar (sanidine, anorthoclase or orthoclase), and rare sodic plagioclase. Biotite, sodium-rich amphiboles and pyroxenes along with iron-rich olivine are common minor minerals. Accessory phases include titanite, apatite, corundum, zircon, magnetite and ilmenite.\n\nBlairmorite is an analcite-rich variety of phonolite.\n\nNepheline syenites and phonolites occur widely distributed throughout the world in Canada, Norway, Greenland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the Ural Mountains, the Pyrenees, Italy, Eifel and Kaiserstuhl in Germany, Brazil, the Transvaal region, the Magnet Cove igneous complex of Arkansas, the Beemerville Complex of New Jersey, as well as on oceanic islands such as the Canary Islands.\n\nNepheline-normative rocks occur in close association with the Bushveld Igneous Complex, possibly formed from partial melting of the wall rocks adjacent to that large ultramafic layered intrusion. Phonolite occurs in the related Pilanesberg Complex and Pienaars River Complex.\n\n\nPhonolites can be of interest as dimension stone or as aggregate for gravels.\n\nRarely, economically mineralised phonolite-nepheline syenite alkaline complexes can be associated with rare-earth mineralisation, uranium mineralisation and phosphates, such as at Phalaborwa, South Africa.\n\nPhonolite tuff was used as a source of flint for adze heads and such by prehistoric people from Hohentwiel and Hegau, Germany.\n\nPhonolites can be separated into slabs of appropriate dimensions to be used as roofing tiles in place of roofing slate. One such occurrence is in the French Massif Central region such as the Haute Loire département.\n\n"}

It is often used as a simple way to define Polynesia.\n\nOutside the triangle, there are traces of Polynesian settlement as far north as Necker Island (\"Mokumanamana\"), as far east as Salas y Gómez Island (\"Motu Motiro Hiva\"), and as far south as Enderby Island (\"Motu Maha\"). There was also once Polynesian settlement on Norfolk Island and Kermadec Island (\"Rangitahua\"). However, by the time the Europeans first arrived, these islands were all uninhabited.\n\nToday, the most numerous Polynesian peoples are the Māori, Hawaiians, Tongans, Samoans, and Tahitians. The native languages of this vast triangle are Polynesian languages, which are classified by linguists as part of the Oceanic subgroup of Malayo-Polynesian. They ultimately derive from the proto-Austronesian language spoken in Southeast Asia 5,000 years ago. There are also numerous Polynesian outlier islands outside the triangle in neighboring Melanesia and Micronesia.\n\nAnthropologists believe that all modern Polynesian cultures descend from a single protoculture established in the South Pacific by migrant Malayo-Polynesian people (\"see also\" Lapita). There is also some evidence that Polynesians ventured as far east as the Isla Salas y Gómez and as far south as the subantarctic islands to the south of New Zealand, however none of these islands are reckoned with Polynesia proper, as no viable settlements have survived.

In Polynesian oral tradition the octopus is known by various names such as Taumata-Fe'e-Fa'atupu-Hau (Grand Octopus of Prosperity), Tumu-Ra'i-Fenua (Beginning-of-Heaven-and-Earth) and Te Wheke-a-Muturangi (The Octopus of Muturangi).\n\n\n"}

Many of the trees are deciduous, losing their leaves during the dry season which normally lasts from December to July.\n\nDry forests exist in two areas on the island of Puerto Rico - along the south coast of the island (in the dry orographic rain shadow of the Cordillera Central) and in the northeastern corner of the island near Fajardo, where the combination of low elevation and strong winds off the ocean (Northeast Trade Winds) result in a dry environment. Dry forests also exist on the adjacent off-shore islands of Vieques, Culebra, Mona, Monito, Desecheo, Caja de Muertos and Cayo Santiago.\n\nThe vast majority of studies have focused on the south coast - almost nothing has been published about the northeastern dry forest. Studies of the offshore islands have been limited to species lists and qualitative descriptions of the vegetation.\n\nPuerto Rican dry forests (like Caribbean dry forests in general) consist of short-stature (usually < tall), multi-stemmed trees. The canopy is largely evergreen (dominated by \"Gymnanthes lucida\" (Euphorbiaceae) in areas of limestone soil), while the emergent layer is considerably more dry-season deciduous.\n\"Guaiacum officinale\", \"Coccoloba venosa\", \"Ceiba pentandra\", and \"Capparis cynophallophora\" are common trees in coastal dry forests. Dry limestone forest species include \"Pisonia albida\", \"Guaiacum sanctum\", and \"Plumeria alba\".\n\nAlthough most of the forest was destroyed for agriculture prior to the 1940s, some patches of forest which pre-date that period still exist. Areas that were used for charcoal production or for fence-posts have recovered rapidly - after 50 years forests that had been used for charcoal production recovered to the point where they were indistinguishable from much older forests.\n\nIn addition, large areas of secondary forest have grown back on abandoned agricultural land. Unlike areas which were only lightly used, these forests on abandoned farmland have far fewer species than do natural forests. Their path to recovery remains uncertain. \nPuerto Rican dry forests are dominated by plants in the families Rubiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Myrtaceae. In this regard they are similar to Jamaican dry forests, but differ sharply from dry forests on the mainland of South and Central America, which are dominated by Fabaceae and Bignoniaceae.\n\nThe best example of dry forests in Puerto Rico (and probably, in the Caribbean as a whole) are in the Guánica State Forest (\"Bosque Estatal de Guánica\") outside the town of Guánica.

{"id": "69310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69310", "title": "Sea of Galilee", "text": "Sea of Galilee\n\nThe Sea of Galilee (, Judeo-Aramaic: יַמּא דטבריא, גִּנֵּיסַר, ), Kinneret or Kinnereth, Lake of Gennesaret, or Lake Tiberias, is a freshwater lake in Israel. It is approximately in circumference, about long, and wide. Its area is at its fullest, and its maximum depth is approximately 43 m (141 feet). At levels between and below sea level, it is the lowest freshwater lake on Earth and the second-lowest lake in the world (after the Dead Sea, a saltwater lake). The lake is fed partly by underground springs although its main source is the Jordan River which flows through it from north to south.\n\nThe Sea of Galilee is situated in northeast Israel, between the Golan Heights and the Galilee region, in the Jordan Rift Valley, the valley caused by the separation of the African and Arabian Plates. Consequently, the area is subject to earthquakes, and in the past, volcanic activity. This is evident by the abundant basalt and other igneous rocks that define the geology of Galilee.\n\nThe lake has been called by different names throughout its history, usually depending on the dominant settlement on its shores. With the changing fate of the towns, the lake's name also changed.\nThe modern Hebrew name, \"Kinneret\", comes from the Hebrew Bible, the main source of the Christian Old Testament, where it appears as the \"sea of Kinneret\" in and , spelled כנרות \"Kinnerot\" in Hebrew in . This name was also found in the scripts of Ugarit, in the Aqhat Epic. \"Kinneret\" was listed among the \"fenced cities\" in . A persistent, though likely erroneous, popular etymology of the name presumes that the name \"Kinneret\" may originate from the Hebrew word \"kinnor\" (\"harp\" or \"lyre\") in view of the shape of the lake. The scholarly consensus, however, is that the origin of the name lies with the important Bronze and Iron Age city of Kinneret, excavated at Tell el-'Oreimeh. However, there is no evidence that the city of Kinneret itself was not named after the body of water rather than vice versa, or for the origin of the town's name.\n\nAll Old and New Testament writers use the term \"sea\" (Hebrew יָם \"yam\", Greek θάλασσα), with the exception of Luke who calls it \"the Lake of Gennesaret\" (), from the Greek λίμνη Γεννησαρέτ (\"limnē Gennēsaret\"), the \"Grecized form of Chinnereth\" according to Easton (1897).\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud, as well as Flavius Josephus mention the sea by the name \"Sea of Ginosar\" after the small fertile plain of Ginosar that lies on its western side. Ginosar is yet another name derived from \"Kinneret\".\n\nIn the New Testament the term \"sea of Galilee\" (, \"thalassan tēs Galilaias\") is used in the gospel of Matthew , the gospel of Mark , and in the gospel of John as \"the sea of Galilee, which is \"the sea\" of Tiberias\" (θαλάσσης τῆς Γαλιλαίας τῆς Τιβεριάδος, \"thalassēs tēs Galilaias tēs Tiberiados\"), the late 1st century CE name. Sea of Tiberias is also the name mentioned in Roman texts and in the Jerusalem Talmud, and was adopted into Arabic as (بحيرة طبريا), \"Lake Tiberias\".\n\nFrom the Umayyad through the Mamluk period the lake was known in Arabic as \"Bahr al-Minya\", the \"Sea of Minya\", after the Umayyad \"qasr\" complex whose ruins are still visible at Khirbat al-Minya. This is the name employed by the medieval Persian and Arab scholars Al-Baladhuri, Al-Tabari and Ibn Kathir.\n\nIn 1989, remains of a hunter-gatherer site were found under the water at the southern end. Remains of mud huts were found in Ohalo. Nahal Ein Gev, located about 3 km east of the lake, contains a village from the late Natufian period. The site is considered one of the first permanent human settlements in the world from a time predating the Neolithic revolution.\n\nThe Sea of Galilee lies on the ancient Via Maris, which linked Egypt with the northern empires. The Greeks, Hasmoneans, and Romans founded flourishing towns and settlements on the land-locked lake including Hippos and Tiberias. The first-century historian Flavius Josephus was so impressed by the area that he wrote, \"One may call this place the ambition of Nature\"; he also reported a thriving fishing industry at this time, with 230 boats regularly working in the lake. Archaeologists discovered one such boat, nicknamed the Jesus Boat, in 1986.\n\nIn the New Testament, much of the ministry of Jesus occurs on the shores of Lake Galilee. In those days, there was a continuous ribbon development of settlements and villages around the lake and plenty of trade and ferrying by boat. The Synoptic Gospels of Mark (1:14–20), Matthew (4:18–22), and Luke (5:1–11) describe how Jesus recruited four of his apostles from the shores of Lake Galilee: the fishermen Simon and his brother Andrew and the brothers John and James. One of Jesus' famous teaching episodes, the Sermon on the Mount, is supposed to have been given on a hill overlooking the lake. Many of his miracles are also said to have occurred here including his walking on water, calming the storm, the disciples and the miraculous catch of fish, and his feeding five thousand people (in Tabgha). In John's Gospel the sea provides the setting for Jesus' third post-resurrection appearance to his disciples (John 21).\n\nIn 135 CE, Bar Kokhba's revolt was put down. The Romans responded by banning all Jews from Jerusalem. The center of Jewish culture and learning shifted to the region of Galilee and the Kinneret, particularly the city of Tiberias. It was in this region that the Jerusalem Talmud was compiled.\n\nThe lake's importance declined when the Byzantines lost control and the area was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate and subsequent Islamic empires. Apart from Tiberias, the major towns and cities in the area were gradually abandoned. The palace Khirbat al-Minya was built by the lake during the reign of the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I (705–715 CE). In 1187, Saladin defeated the armies of the Crusades at the Battle of Hattin, largely because he was able to cut the Crusaders off from the valuable fresh water of the Sea of Galilee.\n\nThe lake had little importance within the early Ottoman Empire. Tiberias did see a significant revival of its Jewish community in the 16th century, but had gradually declined, until in 1660 the city was completely destroyed. In the early 18th century, Tiberias was rebuilt by Zahir al-Umar, becoming the center of his rule over Galilee, and seeing also a revival of its Jewish community.\n\nIn 1909, Jewish pioneers established the first cooperative farming village (kibbutz), Kvutzat Kinneret in the immediate vicinity of the lake. The settlement trained Jewish immigrants in farming and agriculture. Later, Kvutzat Kinneret pioneers established Kibbutz Degania Alef. The Kvutzat Kinneret is considered the cradle of the kibbutz culture of early Zionism and is the birthplace of Naomi Shemer and the burial site of Rachel—two of the most prominent Israeli poets.\n\nIn 1917, the British defeated Ottoman Turkish forces and took control of Palestine, while France took control of Syria. In the carve-up of the Ottoman territories between Britain and France, it was agreed that Britain would retain control of Palestine, while France would control Syria. However, the allies had to fix the border between the Mandatory Palestine and the French Mandate of Syria. The boundary was defined in broad terms by the Franco-British Boundary Agreement of December 1920, which drew it across the middle of the lake. However, the commission established by the 1920 treaty redrew the boundary. The Zionist movement pressured the French and British to assign as many water sources as possible to Mandatory Palestine during the demarcating negotiations. The High Commissioner of Palestine, Herbert Samuel, had sought full control of the Sea of Galilee. The negotiations led to the inclusion into the Palestine territory of the whole Sea of Galilee, both sides of the River Jordan, Lake Hula, Dan spring, and part of the Yarmouk. The final border approved in 1923 followed a 10-meter wide strip along the lake's northeastern shore, cutting the Mandatory Syria (State of Damascus) off from the lake.\n\nThe British and French Agreement provided that existing rights over the use of the waters of the Jordan by the inhabitants of Syria would be maintained; the Government of Syria would have the right to erect a new pier at Semakh on Lake Tiberias or jointly use the existing pier; persons or goods passing between the landing-stage on the Lake of Tiberias and Semakh would not be subject to customs regulations, and the Syrian government would have access to the said landing-stage; the inhabitants of Syria and Lebanon would have the same fishing and navigation rights on Lakes Huleh, Tiberias and River Jordan, while the Government of Palestine would be responsible for policing of lakes.\n\nOn May 15, 1948, Syria invaded the newborn State of Israel, capturing territory along the Sea of Galilee. Under the 1949 armistice agreement between Israel and Syria, Syria occupied the northeast shoreline of the Sea of Galilee. The agreement, though, stated that the armistice line was \"not to be interpreted as having any relation whatsoever to ultimate territorial arrangements.\" Syria remained in possession of the lake's northeast shoreline until the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.\n\nIn the 1950s, Israel formulated a plan to link the Kinneret with the rest of the country's water infrastructure via the National Water Carrier, in order to supply the water demand of the growing country. The carrier was completed in 1964. The Israeli plan, to which the Arab League opposed its own plan to divert the headwaters of the Jordan River, sparked political and sometimes even armed confrontations over the Jordan River basin.\n\nAfter 5 years of drought , Sea of Galilee is expected to get to the black line. The black elevation line is the lowest depth from which irreversible damage begin and no water can be pumped out anymore. Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research describe it as \"The black line marks -214.87 m, the lowest-ever level reached since 1926 when the water level record began. According to the water authority, the Kinneret water level must not decline below this level.\"\n\nIn February 2018, The city of Tiberias requested a desalination plant to treat the water coming from the Sea of Galilee and demanded a new water source for the city. March 2018 was the lowest point in water income to the lake since 1927.\n\nIn September 2018 the Israeli energy and water office announced a project to purr desalinated water from the Mediterranean sea into the sea of Galilee using an underground tunnel, the tunnel is expected to be largest of its kind done in Israel and will transfer half of the Mediterranean desalted water and will push 300 to 500 Million cubic litters of water per year. The plan said to cost five billion shekels. Giora Eiland lead the meetings with the German counterparts to find a suitable contractor to build the project.\n\nIn 1986 the Ancient Galilee Boat, also known as the Jesus Boat, was discovered on the north-west shore of the Sea of Galilee during a drought when water levels receded. It is an ancient fishing boat from the 1st century AD, and although there is no evidence directly linking the boat to Jesus and his disciples it nevertheless is an example of the kind of boat Jesus and his disciples, some of whom were fishermen, would have used.\n\nDuring a routine sonar scan in 2003 (finding published in 2013), archaeologists discovered an enormous conical stone structure. The structure, which has a diameter of around , is made of boulders and stones. The ruins are estimated to be between 2,000 and 12,000 years old, and are about underwater. The estimated weight of the monument is over 60,000 tons. Researchers explain that the site resembles early burial sites in Europe and was likely built in the early Bronze Age.\n\nIn February 2018, archaeologists discovered seven intact mosaic with Greek inscriptions. One inscription, one of the longest found to date in western Galilee, gives the names of donors and the names and positions of church officials, including Irenaeus. Another mosaic mentions a woman as a donor to the church’s construction. This inscription is the first in the region to mention a female donor.\n\nIsrael's National Water Carrier, completed in 1964, transports water from the lake to the population centers of Israel, and in the past supplied most of the country's drinking water. Nowadays the lake supplies approximately 10% of Israel's drinking water needs.\n\nIn 1964, Syria attempted construction of a Headwater Diversion Plan that would have blocked the flow of water into the Sea of Galilee, sharply reducing the water flow into the lake. This project and Israel's attempt to block these efforts in 1965 were factors which played into regional tensions culminating in the 1967 Six-Day War. During the war, Israel captured the Golan Heights, which contain some of the sources of water for the Sea of Galilee.\n\nThe Israeli government monitors water levels and publishes the results daily at this web page. The level over the past eight years can be retrieved from that site. Increasing water demand in Israel, Lebanon and Jordan, as well as dry winters, have resulted in stress on the lake and a decreasing water line to dangerously low levels at times. The Sea of Galilee is at risk of becoming irreversibly salinized by the salt water springs under the lake, which are held in check by the weight of the freshwater on top of them.\n\nUp until the mid-2010s, about of water was pumped through the National Water Carrier each year. Under the terms of the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, Israel also supplies of water annually from the lake to Jordan. In recent years the Israeli government has made extensive investments in water conservation, reclamation and desalination infrastructure in the country. This has allowed it to significantly reduce the amount of water pumped from the lake annually in an effort to restore and improve its ecological environment, as well as respond to some of the most extreme drought conditions in hundreds of years affecting the lake's intake basin since 1998. Therefore, it is expected that in 2016 only about of water will be drawn from the lake for Israeli domestic consumption, a small fraction of the amount typically drawn from the lake over the previous decades.\n\nWith extreme drought conditions continuing to intensify, the government of Israel approved a plan in 2018 to pump desalinated water into the lake in an effort to stop the water level from plunging below a point where irreversible ecological damage to the lake might take place.\n\nTourism around the Sea of Galilee is an important economic branch. Historical and religious sites in the region draw both local and foreign tourists. The Sea of Galilee is an attraction for Christian pilgrims who visit Israel to see the places where Jesus performed miracles according to the New Testament, such as his walking on water, calming the storm and feeding the multitude. Alonzo Ketcham Parker, a nineteenth-century American traveler, called visiting the Sea of Galilee \"a 'fifth gospel' which one read devoutly, his heart overflowing with quiet joy\".\n\nIn April 2011, Israel unveiled a hiking trail in Galilee for Christian pilgrims, called the \"Jesus Trail\". It includes a network of footpaths, roads and bicycle paths linking sites central to the lives of Jesus and his disciples. It ends at Capernaum on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus espoused his teachings.\n\nAnother key attraction is the site where the Sea of Galilee's water flows into the Jordan River, to which thousands of pilgrims from all over the world come to be baptized every year.\n\nIsrael's most well-known open water swim race, the Kinneret Crossing, is held every year in September, drawing thousands of open water swimmers to participate in competitive and noncompetitive events.\n\nTourists also partake in the building of rafts on \"Lavnun Beach\", called Rafsodia. Here many different age groups work together to build a raft with their bare hands and then sail that raft across the sea.\n\nOther economic activities include fishing in the lake and agriculture, particularly bananas, dates, mangoes, grapes and olives in the fertile belt of land surrounding it.\n\nThe warm waters of the Sea of Galilee support various flora and fauna, which have supported a significant commercial fishery for more than two millennia. Local flora include various reeds along most of the shoreline as well as phytoplankton. Fauna include zooplankton, benthos and a number of fish species such as \"Acanthobrama terraesanctae\". Fish caught commercially include \"Tristramella simonis\" and \"Sarotherodon galilaeus\", locally called \"St. Peter’s Fish\". In 2005, of tilapia were caught by local fishermen. This dropped to in 2009 due to overfishing.\n\nHowever, low water levels in drought years have stressed the lake's ecology. This may have been aggravated by over-extraction of water for either the National Water Carrier to supply other parts of Israel or, since 1994, for the supply of water to Jordan (see \"Water use\" section above). Droughts of the early and mid-1990s dried out the marshy northern margin of the lake. A fish species that is unique to the lake, \"Tristramella sacra\", used to spawn in the marsh and has not been seen since the 1990s droughts. Conservationists fear this species may have become extinct. It is hoped that drastic reductions in the amount of water pumped through the National Water Carrier will help restore the lake's ecology over the span of several years. As such, the amount planned to be drawn in 2016 for Israeli domestic water use is expected to be less than 10% of the amount commonly drawn on an annual basis in the decades before the mid-2010s.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20837958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20837958", "title": "Stratospheric sulfur aerosols", "text": "Stratospheric sulfur aerosols\n\nStratospheric sulfur aerosols are sulfur-rich particles which exist in the stratosphere region of the Earth's atmosphere. The layer of the atmosphere in which they exist is known as the Junge layer, or simply the stratospheric aerosol layer. These particles consist of a mixture of sulfuric acid and water. They are created naturally, such as by photochemical decomposition of sulfur-containing gases, e.g. carbonyl sulfide. When present in high levels, e.g. after a strong volcanic eruption such as Mount Pinatubo, they produce a cooling effect, by reflecting sunlight, and by modifying clouds as they fall out of the stratosphere. This cooling may persist for a few years before the particles fall out.\n\nAn aerosol is a suspension of fine solid particles or liquid droplets in a gas. \nThe sulfate particles or sulfuric acid droplets in the atmosphere are about 0.1 to 1.0 micrometer (a millionth of a meter) in diameter.\n\nSulfur aerosols are common in the troposphere as a result of pollution with sulfur dioxide from burning coal, and from natural processes. Volcanos are a major source of particles in the stratosphere as the force of the volcanic eruption propels sulfur-containing gases into the stratosphere. The relative influence of volcanoes on the Junge layer varies considerably according to the number and size of eruptions in any given time period, and also of quantities of sulfur compounds released. Only stratovolcanoes containing primarily granitic rocks are responsible for these fluxes, as basaltic rock erupted in shield volcanoes doesn't result in plumes which reach the stratosphere.\n\nCreating stratospheric sulfur aerosols deliberately is a proposed geoengineering technique which offers a possible solution to some of the problems caused by global warming. However, this will not be without side effects and it has been suggested that the cure may be worse than the disease.\n\nNatural sulfur aerosols are formed in vast quantities from the SO ejected by volcanoes, which may be injected directly into the stratosphere during very large (Volcanic Explosivity Index, VEI, of 4 or greater) eruptions. A comprehensive analysis, dealing largely with tropospheric sulfur compounds in the atmosphere, is provided by Bates et al.\n\nThe IPCC AR4 says \"explosive volcanic events are episodic, but the stratospheric aerosols resulting from them yield substantial transitory perturbations to the radiative energy balance of the planet, with both shortwave and longwave effects sensitive to the microphysical characteristics of the aerosols\".\n\nDuring periods lacking volcanic activity (and thus direct injection of SO into the stratosphere), oxidation of COS (carbonyl sulfide) dominates the production of stratospheric sulfur aerosol.\n\nThe chemistry of stratospheric sulfur aerosols varies significantly according to their source. Volcanic emissions vary significantly in composition, and have complex chemistry due to the presence of ash particulates and a wide variety of other elements in the plume.\n\nThe chemical reactions affecting both the formation and elimination of sulfur aerosols are not fully understood. It is difficult to estimate accurately, for example, whether the presence of ash and water vapour is important for aerosol formation from volcanic products, and whether high or low atmospheric concentrations of precursor chemicals (such as SO and HS) are optimal for aerosol formation. This uncertainty makes it difficult to determine a viable approach for geoengineering uses of sulfur aerosol formation.\n\nUnderstanding of these aerosols comes in large part from the study of volcanic eruptions, notably Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, which erupted in 1991 when scientific techniques were sufficiently far advanced to study the effects carefully.\n\nThe formation of the aerosols and their effects on the atmosphere can also be studied in the lab. Samples of actual particles can be recovered from the stratosphere using balloons or aircraft.\n\nComputer models can be used to understand the behaviour of aerosol particles, and are particularly useful in modelling their effect on global climate.\n\nBiological experiments in the lab, and field/ocean measurements can establish the formation mechanisms of biologically derived volatile sulfurous gases.\n\nIt has been established that emission of precursor gases for sulfur aerosols is the principal mechanism by which volcanoes cause episodic global cooling. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR4 regards stratospheric sulfate aerosols as having a low level of scientific understanding. The aerosol particles form a whitish haze in the sky. This creates a global dimming effect, where less of the sun's radiation is able to reach the surface of the Earth. This leads to a global cooling effect. In essence, they act as the reverse of a greenhouse gas, which tends to allow visible light from the sun through, whilst blocking infrared light emitted from the Earth's surface and its atmosphere. The particles also radiate infrared energy directly, as they lose heat into space.\n\nAll aerosols both absorb and scatter solar and terrestrial radiation. This is quantified in the \"Single Scattering Albedo\" (SSA), the ratio of scattering alone to scattering plus absorption (\"extinction\") of radiation by a particle. The SSA tends to unity if scattering dominates, with relatively little absorption, and decreases as absorption increases, becoming zero for infinite absorption. For example, sea-salt aerosol has an SSA of 1, as a sea-salt particle only scatters, whereas soot has an SSA of 0.23, showing that it is a major atmospheric aerosol absorber.\n\nAerosols, natural and anthropogenic, can affect the climate by changing the way radiation is transmitted through the atmosphere. Direct observations of the effects of aerosols are quite limited so any attempt to estimate their global effect necessarily involves the use of computer models. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, says: \"While the radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases may be determined to a reasonably high degree of accuracy... the uncertainties relating to aerosol radiative forcings remain large, and rely to a large extent on the estimates from global modelling studies that are difficult to verify at the present time\". However, they are mostly talking about tropospheric aerosol.\n\nThe aerosols have a role in the destruction of ozone due to surface chemistry effects. Destruction of ozone has in recent years created large holes in the ozone layer, initially over the Antarctic and then the Arctic. These holes in the ozone layer have the potential to expand to cover inhabited and vegetative regions of the planet, leading to catastrophic environmental damage.\n\nOzone destruction occurs principally in polar regions, but the formation of ozone occurs principally in the tropics. Ozone is distributed around the planet by the Brewer-Dobson circulation. Therefore, the source and dispersal pattern of aerosols is critical in understanding their effect on the ozone layer.\n\nAerosols scatter light, which affects the appearance of the sky and of sunsets. Changing the concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere can dramatically affect the appearance of sunsets. A change in sky appearance during 1816, \"The Year Without A Summer\" (attributed to the eruption of Mount Tambora), was the inspiration for the paintings of J. M. W. Turner. Further volcanic eruptions and geoengineering projects involving sulfur aerosols are likely to affect the appearance of sunsets significantly, and to create a haze in the sky.\n\nAerosol particles are eventually deposited from the stratosphere onto land and ocean. Depending on the volume of particles descending, the effects may be significant to ecosystems, or may not be. Modelling of the quantities of aerosols used in likely geoengineering scenarios suggest that effects on terrestrial ecosystems from deposition is not likely to be significantly harmful.\n\nThe ability of stratospheric sulfur aerosols to create this global dimming effect has made them a possible candidate for use in climate engineering projects to limit the effect and impact of climate change due to rising levels of greenhouse gases. Delivery of precursor gases such as HS and SO by artillery, aircraft and balloons has been proposed.\n\nUnderstanding of this proposed technique is partly based on the fact that it is the adaptation of an existing atmospheric process. The technique is therefore potentially better understood than are comparable (but purely speculative) climate engineering proposals. It is also partly based on the speed of action of any such solution deployed, in contrast to carbon sequestration projects such as carbon dioxide air capture which would take longer to work. However, gaps in understanding of these processes exist, for example the effect on stratospheric climate and on rainfall patterns, and further research is needed.\n\n"}

{"id": "164547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164547", "title": "Sudden stratospheric warming", "text": "Sudden stratospheric warming\n\nA sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) is an event in which the observed stratospheric temperature rises by several tens of kelvins (up to about 50 °C (90 °F)), over the course of a few days. The change is preceded by a situation in which the Polar jet stream of westerly winds in the winter hemisphere is disturbed by natural weather patterns or disturbances in the lower atmosphere.\n\nThe first continuous measurements of the stratosphere were taken by Richard Scherhag in 1951. He used radiosondes to take reliable temperature readings in the upper stratosphere (~40 km). It was his persistence which led him to witness the first ever observed stratospheric warming on 27 January 1952. After his discovery, Scherhag assembled a team of meteorologists specifically to study the stratosphere at the Free University of Berlin. This group continued to map the northern-hemisphere stratospheric temperature and geopotential height for many years using radiosondes and rocketsondes. In 1979 when the satellite era began, meteorological measurements became far more frequent. Although satellites were primarily used for the troposphere they also recorded data for the stratosphere. Today both satellites and stratospheric radiosondes are used to take measurements of the stratosphere.\n\nTypically stratospheric meteorologists classify the vortex breakdown into three categories: major, minor, and final. No unambiguous\nstandard definition for major, minor, and final warmings has so far been adopted. \"Major SSWs occur when the winter polar stratospheric westerlies reverse to easterlies. In minor warmings, the polar temperature\ngradient reverses but the circulation does not, and in final warmings, the vortex breaks down and remains easterly until the following boreal autumn\".(Butler et al 2017)\n\nSometimes a fourth category, the Canadian warming, is included because of its unique and distinguishing structure and evolution.\n\n\"There are two main types of SSW: displacement events in which the stratospheric polar vortex is displaced from the pole and split events in which the vortex splits into two or more vortices. Some SSWs are a combination of both types\". (Butler et al 2017).\n\nThese occur when the westerly winds at 60N and 10hPa (geopotential height) reverse, i.e. become easterly. A complete disruption of the polar vortex is observed and the vortex will either be split into daughter vortices, or displaced from its normal location over the pole.\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization's Commission for Atmospheric Sciences (Mclnturff, 1978): \"a stratospheric warming can be said to be major if at 10 mb or below the latitudinal mean temperature increases poleward from 60 degree latitude and an associated circulation reversal is observed (that is, the prevailing mean westerly winds poleward of 60 latitude are succeeded by mean easterlies in the same area).\"\n\nMinor warmings are similar to major warmings however they are less dramatic, the westerly winds are slowed, however do not reverse. Therefore a breakdown of the vortex is never observed.\n\nMclnturff states: \"a stratospheric warming is called minor if a significant temperature increase is observed (that is, at least 25 degrees in a period of week or less) at any stratospheric level in any area of winter time hemisphere. The polar vortex is not broken down and the wind reversal from westerly to easterly is less extensive.\"\n\nThe radiative cycle in the stratosphere means that during winter the mean flow is westerly and during summer it is easterly (westward). A final warming occurs on this transition, so that the polar vortex winds change direction for the warming, however do not change back until the following winter. This is because the stratosphere has entered the summer easterly phase. It is final because another warming cannot occur over the summer, so it is the final warming of the current winter.\n\nCanadian warmings occur in early winter in the stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere, typically from mid November to early December. They have no counterpart in the southern hemisphere.\n\nIn a usual northern-hemisphere winter, several minor warming events occur, with a major event occurring roughly every two years. One reason for major stratospheric warmings to occur in the Northern hemisphere is because orography and land-sea temperature contrasts are responsible for the generation of long (wavenumber 1 or 2) Rossby waves in the troposphere. These waves travel upward to the stratosphere and are dissipated there, decelerating the winds and warming the Arctic. This is the reason that major warmings are only observed in the northern-hemisphere, with one exception. In 2002 a southern-hemisphere major warming was observed. This event to date is not fully understood.\n\nAt an initial time a blocking-type circulation pattern establishes in the troposphere. This blocking pattern causes Rossby waves with zonal wavenumber 1 and/or 2 to grow to unusually large amplitudes. The growing wave propagates into the stratosphere and decelerates the mean zonal winds. Thus the polar night jet weakens and simultaneously becomes distorted by the growing planetary waves. Because the wave amplitude increases with decreasing density this easterly acceleration process is not effective at fairly high levels. If the waves are sufficiently strong the mean zonal flow may decelerate sufficiently so that the winter westerlies turn easterly. At this point planetary waves may no longer penetrate into the stratosphere ). Hence further upward transfer of energy is completely blocked and a very rapid easterly deceleration and the polar warming occur at this critical level, which must then move downward until eventually the warming and zonal wind reversal affect the entire polar stratosphere.\n\nThere exists a link between sudden stratospheric warmings and the quasi-biennial oscillation: If the QBO is in its easterly phase, the atmospheric waveguide is modified in such a way that upward-propagating Rossby waves are focused on the polar vortex, intensifying their interaction with the mean flow. Thus, there exists a statistically significant imbalance between the frequency of sudden stratospheric warmings if these events are grouped according to the QBO phase (easterly or westerly).\n\nAlthough sudden stratospheric warmings are mainly forced by planetary scale waves which propagate up from the lower atmosphere, there is also a subsequent return effect of sudden stratospheric warmings on surface weather. Following a sudden stratospheric warming, the high altitude winds reverse to flow eastward instead of their usual westward. The eastward winds progress down through the atmosphere and weaken the jet stream, often giving easterly winds near the surface and resulting in dramatic reductions in temperature in Europe. This process can take a few days to a few weeks to occur.\n\n\n\n"}

Tolkien's novel \"The Lord of the Rings\", translates to \"The Power of the Sun\".\n\nOn 27 September 2010, \"Tûranor PlanetSolar\" set off from Monaco to circumnavigate the globe solely with the aid of solar power. One aim of the project was to focus public awareness on the importance of renewable energies for environmental protection.\n\nThe boat had a crew of four. The expedition leader and founder of the PlanetSolar project Raphaël Domjan. The captain of the boat was Patrick Marchesseau, but at the midpoint of the circumnavigation (in New Caledonia in mid-May 2011) the French Canadian Erwann Le Rouzic took over as captain.\n\nA significant stopover was Cancún, Mexico, during the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference held there from 29 November to 10 December 2010. During the expedition, \"Tûranor PlanetSolar\" broke two records: the fastest crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by solar boat and the longest distance ever covered by a solar electric vehicle. \"Tûranor PlanetSolar\" returned to Monaco on 4 May 2012 after 584 days sailing around the globe.\n\nAfter an engine refit, \"Tûranor PlanetSolar\" broke its own record, crossing the Atlantic Ocean from Las Palmas to Saint Martin in the Caribbean in only 22 days, four days faster than on the circumnavigation trip. The boat left Las Palmas on 25 April and arrived in Marigot on Saint Martin on 18 May The trip led to Miami, Florida, and then continued as a scientific expedition along the Gulf Stream. On the return trip the boat reached St John's, Newfoundland, on 1 August 2013 before heading back across the Atlantic.\nThe story of \"Tûranor PlanetSolar\" can be found in Kevin Desmond's 280-page \"Electric Boats and Ships: a History\" published by McFarland Books in September 2017.\n\n\n"}
