The Protocol seeks \"to control, reduce or eliminate discharge, emissions and losses of persistent organic pollutants\" in Europe, some former Soviet Union countries, and the United States, in order to reduce their transboundary fluxes so as to protect human health and the environment from adverse effects.\n\nAuthors and promoters of the Protocol were the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), which at the time housed 53 different country members and alliance. The protocol was amended on 18 December 2009, but the amended version has not yet come into force.\n\nAs of May 2013, the protocol has been ratified by 31 states and the European Union.\n\nIn the United States, the protocol is an executive agreement that does not require Senate approval. However, legislation is needed to resolve inconsistencies between provisions of the protocol and existing U.S. laws (specifically the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act).\n\nThe following substances are contained in the CLRTAP POPs Protocol. The document focuses on a list of 16 substances that have been singled out according to agreed risk criteria (comprising eleven pesticides, two industrial chemicals and three by-products/contaminants). The Protocol assigned the arrangements for proper disposal of waste products deemed banned and limited, including medical supplies.\n\n\n\n"}

As a navigator he achieved in 1536 the \"second\" world circumnavigation (after the first one led by Ferdinand Magellan and Juan Sebastián Elcano and their crew in 1522). Urdaneta discovered and plotted a path across the Pacific from the Philippines to Acapulco in the Viceroyalty of New Spain (present day Mexico) used by the Manila galleons, which came to be known as \"Urdaneta's route.\" He was considered as \"protector of the Indians\" for his treatment of the Filipino natives; also Cebu and the Philippines' first prelate.\n\nUrdaneta was born in the town of Ordizia, Spain.\n\nUrdaneta was one of the few survivors of the Loaísa Expedition to reach the Spice Islands late in the year 1526, only to be taken prisoner by the Portuguese. Urdaneta spent the next eight and a half years in and around the Spice Islands, but eventually he managed to return to Europe in the Portuguese India Armada and under Portuguese guard. Upon his arrival in Lisbon on June 26, 1536, he achieved the second world circumnavigation. Urdaneta accomplished his trip around the world through a journey which lasted just shy of eleven years.\n\nIn Lisbon the Portuguese authorities confiscated his charts and letters. Urdaneta then escaped to Spain, where he recreated much of the confiscated material, and presented it to the Spanish Court. King Charles I of Spain did not give him a very favourable reception either, and, wearied by his many adventures, he returned to New Spain and there entered the Order of Hermits of St. Augustine.\n\nAt the death of the viceroy, Don Luís de Velasco, in 1564, New Spain had passed under the government of the Audiencia, one of whose first cares was to equip an expedition for the conquest and colonization of the Philippines. This had been ordered by Philip II in 1559. Friar Andrés de Urdaneta having been designated as the Commander, the Viceroy had the matter under consideration at the time of his death. Urdaneta was considered a great navigator and especially fitted for cruising in Indian waters. Philip II wrote urging him to join the expedition and offering him the command. Urdaneta agreed to accompany the expedition but refused to take command; the \"adelantado\", Don Miguel López de Legazpi, was appointed as Commander. The expedition, composed of the \"Capitana\", which carried on board Legazpi and Urdaneta, the galleons \"San Pablo\" and \"San Pedro\", and the tenders \"San Juan\" and \"San Lucas\", set sail on November 21, 1564.\n\nUrdaneta founded the first churches in the Philippines, the St. Vitales Church and the Basilica del Santo Niño; he served as the first prelate of the Church in Cebu. After spending some time in the islands, Legazpi determined to remain and sent Urdaneta back for the purpose of finding a better return route and to obtain help from New Spain for the Philippine colony. (For the problem of sailing east across the Pacific, which Urdaneta solved, see Manila Galleon and Volta do Mar.) Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel (the island of Cebu), on June 1, 1565 and was obliged to sail as far as 38 degrees North latitude to obtain favourable winds. With the voyage in trouble, Urdaneta had to assume command himself. The ship reached the port of Acapulco, on October 8, 1565, having traveled 12,000 miles (20,000 km) in 130 days. Fourteen of the crew had died; only Urdaneta and Felipe de Salcedo, nephew of López de Legazpi, had strength enough to cast the anchors.\n\nUpon arriving, Urdaneta discovered that a member of the crew of his expedition, Alonso de Arellano—who had abandoned them just after leaving the port—had actually beaten them across the ocean, arriving at Barra de Navidad in Jalisco in August of the same year. However, Arellano was in disgrace for his rebellion against the authority of Legazpi, and his notes were far less precise and professional than Urdaneta's, and so the latter's route became the famous and trusted one.\n\nFrom Mexico, Urdaneta went to Europe to make a report on the expedition and then returned to New Spain, intending to continue on to the Philippines, but he was dissuaded by his friends. He wrote two accounts of his voyages: one giving the account of the Loaiza expedition was published; the other, which gives the account of his return voyage, is preserved in manuscript in the archives of the Council of the Indies.\n\nFor the remainder of the 16th and 17th centuries, Spanish ships, particularly the annual Manila-Acapulco trading Galleon, used \"Urdaneta's route.\"\n\nIn the Philippines, the City of Urdaneta in Pangasinan was named after him. The same city is the seat of one of the biggest dioceses on the country.\n\nUrdaneta died in Mexico City in 1568.\n\n"}

Towards western Swiss Plateau, the Bise is pressed between the Jura mountains and Pre-Alps whereby it strengthens and mostly climaxes on the western shore of Lake Geneva. In summer, the Bise wind causes rather dry and sunny weather whereas in winter, it frequently forms low stratus clouds over the Swiss Plateau by strengthening the inversion layer.\n\nThe Bise can sometimes lead to severe icing during winter months in Geneva and nearby communities. Many foreign travellers to this Swiss city have commented upon the Bise.\n\nThe strength of the Bise wind can be determined by the analysis of the air pressure difference (in hectopascal [hPa]) between Geneva and Güttingen in canton of Thurgau. The Bise arises as soon as the air pressure in Güttingen (TG) is higher than in Geneva. The greater this air pressure difference, the stronger the Bise blows through the Swiss Plateau. In case of an inverted air pressure difference (low air pressure in Güttingen (TG) and high air pressure in Geneva), the opposite of Bise occurs: The wind blows from southwest through the Swiss Plateau.\n\nAn alternative form in English is Biz.

It flows through Bangkok and then into the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nOn many old European maps, the river is named \"Menam\" or \"Mae Nam\" (Thai: แม่น้ำ), Thai for \"river\". James McCarthy, F.R.G.S., who served as Director-General of the Siamese Government Surveys prior to establishment of the Royal Survey Department, wrote in his account, \"\"Me Nam\" is a generic term, \"me\" signifying \"mother\" and \"Nam\" \"water,\" and the epithet Chao P'ia signifies that it is the chief river in the kingdom of Siam.\"\n\nH. Warington Smyth, who served as Director of the Department of Mines in Siam from 1891 to 1896, refers to it in his book first published in 1898 as \"the Me Nam Chao Phraya\".\n\nIn the English-language media in Thailand, the name Chao Phraya River is often translated as \"river of kings\".\n\nThe Chao Phraya begins at the confluence of the Ping and Nan rivers at Nakhon Sawan (also called Pak Nam Pho) in Nakhon Sawan Province. After this it flows south for from the central plains to Bangkok and the Gulf of Thailand. In Chai Nat, the river then splits into the main course and the Tha Chin River, which then flows parallel to the main river and exits in the Gulf of Thailand about west of Bangkok in Samut Sakhon. In the low alluvial plain which begins below the Chainat Dam, there are many small canals (\"khlong\") which split off from the main river. The \"khlongs\" are used for the irrigation of the region's rice paddies.\n\nThe rough coordinates of the river are 13 N, 100 E. This area has a wet monsoon climate, with over of rainfall per year. Temperatures range from in Bangkok.\n\nThe lower Chao Phraya underwent several man-made modifications during the Ayutthaya period. Several shortcut canals were constructed to bypass large loops in the river, shortening the trip from the capital city to the sea. The course of the river has since changed to follow many of these canals.\n\n\nCities along the Chao Phraya include, from north to south, Nakhon Sawan Province, Uthai Thani Province, Chai Nat Province, Sing Buri Province, Ang Thong Province, Ayutthaya Province, Pathum Thani Province, Nonthaburi Province, Bangkok, and Samut Prakan Province. These cities are among the most historically significant and densely populated settlements of Thailand due to their access to the waterway.\n\nMajor bridges cross the Chao Phraya in Bangkok: the Rama VI railroad bridge; Phra Pin-klao near the Grand Palace; Rama VIII, a single tower asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge; Rama IX, a semi-symmetric cable-stayed bridge; and Mega Bridge, on the Industrial Ring Road.\n\nIn Bangkok, the Chao Phraya is a major transportation artery for a network of river buses, cross-river ferries, and water taxis (\"longtails\"). More than 15 boat lines operate on the rivers and canals of the city, including commuter lines.\n\nThe principal tributaries of the Chao Phraya River are the Pa Sak River, the Sakae Krang River, the Nan River (along with its principal confluent the Yom River), the Ping River (with its principal confluent, the Wang River), and the Tha Chin River. Each of these tributaries (and the Chao Phraya itself) is augmented by minor tributaries referred to as \"khwae\". All of the tributaries, including the lesser khwae, form an extensive tree-like pattern, with branches flowing through nearly every province in central and northern Thailand. None of the tributaries of the Chao Phraya extend beyond the nation's borders. The Nan and the Yom River flow nearly parallel from Phitsanulok to Chumsaeng in the north of Nakhon Sawan Province. The Wang River enters the Ping River near Sam Ngao district in Tak Province.\n\nThe expanse of the Chao Phraya River and its tributaries, i.e., the Chao Phraya river system, together with the land upon which falling rain drains into these bodies of water, form the Chao Phraya watershed.\n\nThe Chao Phraya watershed is the largest watershed in Thailand, covering approximately 35 percent of the nation's land, and draining an area of .\n\nThe watershed is divided into the following basins:\n\nTo the west, the central plain of Thailand is drained by the Mae Klong and the east by the Bang Pakong River. They are not part of the Chao Praya system.\n\nThe landscape of the river basins is a very wide, flat, well-watered plain continuously refreshed with soil and sediment brought down by the rivers. The lower central plain from the delta north to Ang Thong Province is a flat, low area with an average of two metres above sea level. Further north and into the plains of the Ping and the Nan the elevation is over 20 m. Then the mountains that are the natural boundary of the Chao Praya watershed form a divide, which has, to some degree, historically isolated Thailand from other Southeast Asian civilisations. In northern Thailand the divide roughly corresponds to a long section of the political border of the country today. Southern portions of the divide's boundary correspond less to the nation's political border, because isolation in this area was prevented by the ease of transportation along the lowlands surrounding the Gulf of Thailand, allowing a unified Thai civilisation to extend beyond the watershed without issue. The slightly higher northern plains have been farmed for centuries and saw a major change from the 13th century during the Sukhothai Kingdom in the 13th and 14th centuries and the Ayutthaya Kingdom that succeeded it when rice growing intensified with the introduction of floating rice, a much faster-growing strain of rice from Bengal. The southern swamps meanwhile changed radically from the 18th century when King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke moved the capital of Siam to Bangkok, and a process of canalisation and cultivation began, especially as Thailand began to export rice from 1855.\n\nThe Tha Chin River is the major distributary of the Chao Phraya River. The expanse of the Chao Phraya and Tha Chin Rivers and their distributaries, starting at the point at which the distributaries diverge, together with the land amid the triangle formed by the outermost and innermost distributary, form the Chao Phraya delta. The many distributaries of the Chao Phraya delta are interconnected by canals that serve both for irrigation and for transportation.\n\nThe lowland areas of the Chao Phraya watershed in central Thailand have been designated as the Chao Phraya freshwater swamp forests, a tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests ecoregion, an area about north to south and wide.\n\nThe original swamp forests have almost entirely been removed as the plain has been converted to rice paddies, other agriculture, and urban areas like Bangkok. Much of the wildlife that once inhabited these plains has disappeared, including a large number of fish in the river systems, birds such as vultures, the Oriental darter (\"Anhinga melanogaster\"), white-eyed river martin (\"Pseudochelidon sirintarae\"), the sarus crane (\"Grus antigone\") and animals such as tigers, Asian elephants, Javan rhinoceroses, and the much-hunted Schomburgk's deer. Today we can only guess at the original habitat and wildlife by comparing it with neighbouring countries. It is believed that the area would have consisted of freshwater swamps inland and salty mangroves on the coast and the river estuaries. The swamp would have been covered in \"Phragmites\" marsh grasses. Today there is a small area of this remaining in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, a relic of the original landscape.\n\nAs so much has been cleared or altered the potential for creating large protected areas to preserve original habitat no longer exists. However much wildlife does remain in the rice fields and steps may be taken to preserve these as urban and industrial development on the plains is ongoing and the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand has very little control or planning over this. Particular threats come from the conversion of rice paddies to large-scale production of prawns by pumping in seawater, and the use of pesticides to eliminate the introduced snail,\"Pomacea canaliculata\", which damages rice plants.\n\nThere are populations of threatened birds, including colonies of breeding water birds such as the world's largest populations of the near-threatened Asian openbill (\"Anastomus oscitans\"), and other birds such as the wintering black kite (\"Milvus migrans\"). Endemic mammals that remain are the limestone rat (\"Niviventer hinpoon\"), Neill's long-tailed giant rat (\"Leopoldamys neilli\"), and the near-endemic Thailand roundleaf bat (\"Hipposideros halophyllus\").\n\nThe Chao Phraya basin is home to about half a dozen endemic dragonflies and damselflies. The conservation status of most of these in unclear (they are rated as data deficient by the IUCN), but \"Cryptophaea saukra\" is critically endangered and \"Caliphaea angka\" is endangered.\n\nThere are few areas of wetland protected as national parks, but these are mostly very small.\n\nThe Chao Phraya basin is home to around 280 species of fish, including about 30 endemics. By far the most diverse family is Cyprinidae with 108 species. The mainstream of the Chao Phraya River has about 190 native fish species. In general, the aquatic fauna of Chao Phraya and Mae Klong show clear similarities, and they are sometimes combined in a single ecoregion with 328 fish species. Despite their similarities, there are also differences between the aquatic fauna of Chao Phraya and Mae Klong; the latter (but not the former) is home to a few taxa otherwise only known in major Burmese rivers: the Irrawaddy, Salween, and Tenasserim. The aquatic fauna in Chao Phraya–Mae Klong also show clear similarities with that of the middle Mekong (the lower Mekong fauna more closely resembles that of the eastern Malay Peninsula). It is believed that the upper Mekong was connected to Chao Phraya (rather than present-day lower Mekong) until the Quaternary, which explains the similarities in their river faunas. This included the Nan River basin, a tributary of the Chao Phraya, which is home to a number of taxa (for example, \"Ambastaia nigrolineata\" and \"Sectoria\") otherwise only known from Mekong. Of the fish species known from the Chao Phraya–Mae Klong, only about 50 are absent from the Mekong.\n\nThere has been extensive habitat destruction (pollution, dams, and drainage for irrigation) in the Chao Phraya basin and overfishing also presents a problem. Within mainland Southeast Asia, the only freshwater region with similar high levels of threat is the lower Mekong. It has been estimated that only around 30 native fish species still are able to reproduce in the mainstream of the Chao Phraya River.\n\nThe catfish \"Platytropius siamensis\" is endemic to Chao Phraya and Bang Pakong, but has not been recorded since the 1970s and is considered extinct. Recent records of the near-endemic cyprinid \"Balantiocheilos ambusticauda\" are also lacking and it is possibly extinct. Three of the largest freshwater fish in the world are native to the river, but these are all seriously threatened: the critically endangered giant barb (wild populations have been extirpated from Chao Phraya, but remain elsewhere), critically endangered giant pangasius, and endangered giant freshwater stingray. The critically endangered red-tailed black shark, a small colourful cyprinid that is endemic to Chao Phraya, is commonly seen in the aquarium trade where it is bred in large numbers, but the only remaining wild population is at a single location that covers less than . The endangered dwarf loach, another species bred in large numbers for the aquarium trade, has been extirpated from most of its range in Chao Phraya. The critically endangered Siamese tigerfish has been entirely exirpated from Chao Phraya and Mae Klong, but small populations remain in the Mekong basin.\n\nMany other species that either are prominent in the aquarium trade or important food fish are native to the Chao Phraya basin, such as the climbing perch, blue panchax, Asian bumblebee catfish, giant snakehead, striped snakehead, walking catfish, banded loach, several \"Yasuhikotakia\" loaches, tinfoil barb, Siamese algae eater, silver barb, pearl danio, rainbow shark, Hampala barb, black sharkminnow, \"Leptobarbus rubripinna\", long pectoral-fin minnow, bonylip barb, Jullien's golden carp, blackline rasbora, scissortail rasbora, \"Tor tambroides\", finescale tigerfish, marble goby, Chinese algae eater, giant featherback, clown featherback, giant gourami, several \"Trichopodus\" gouramis, iridescent shark, several \"Pangasius\", \"Belodontichthys truncatus\", several \"Phalacronotus\" sheatfish, several \"Wallago\" catfish, largescale archerfish, smallscale archerfish, and wrestling halfbeak.\n\nThe Thai Pollution Control Department (PCD) reports that the water quality of major rivers flowing into the upper Gulf of Thailand has seriously deteriorated in the past decade. The department found the lower Chao Phraya contains bacteria and nutrient pollution from phosphates, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Nutrient pollution causes algae to grow faster than ecosystems can handle, harming water quality, food resources for aquatic animals, and marine habitats. It also decreases the oxygen that fish need to survive. PCD rated water quality at the mouth of Chao Phraya at Bangkok's Bang Khun Thian District as \"very poor\", worse than in 2014. PCD findings indicated large amounts of wastewater were discharged into the river from households, industry, and agriculture.\n\n\n\n"}

Smart, a high church Anglican, was widely known throughout London.\n\nSmart was infamous as the pseudonymous midwife \"Mrs. Mary Midnight\" and widespread accounts of his father-in-law, John Newbery, locking him away in a mental asylum for many years over Smart's supposed religious \"mania\". Even after Smart's eventual release, a negative reputation continued to pursue him as he was known for incurring more debt than he could repay; this ultimately led to his confinement in debtors' prison until his death.\n\nSmart's two most widely known works are \"A Song to David\" and \"Jubilate Agno\", both at least partly written during his confinement in asylum. However, \"Jubilate Agno\" was not published until 1939 and \"A Song to David\" received mixed reviews until the 19th century. To his contemporaries, Smart was known mainly for his many contributions in the journals \"The Midwife\" and \"The Student\", along with his famous \"Seaton Prize poems\" and his mock epic \"The Hilliad\". Although he is primarily recognised as a religious poet, his poetry includes various other themes, such as his theories on nature and his promotion of English nationalism.\n\nChristopher Smart was born in Shipbourne in Kent, England on the Fairlawn estate of William, Viscount Vane, younger son of Lord Barnard of Barnard Castle. He was, according to his nephew, \"of a delicate constitution having been born earlier than the natural period\". He was baptised in Wrotham parish on 11 May 1722. Smart's father was Peter Smart, steward or bailiff of Fairlawne. His mother was Winifred Smart of the Griffiths family of Radnorshire, Wales.\n\nWinifred was born c 1691, given that when she died in 1766 she was 75 years of age: \"15 May 1766 Forename: Winefred, Widow Surname: Smart Age: 75 Place: St John in Thanet (Margate), St John the Baptist County: Kent Archive Reference: U3/140/1/3\" This was near Margate where she had been living \"Dr. John Hawkesworth visited him (Christopher Smart) in October 1764, and found him silently hostile towards his mother, Winifred Smart, and his sister, Margaret Hunter, at Margate\" (The Poetry of Christopher Smart by Moira Dearnley).\n\nWinifred's parentage \"Of the Griffiths family of Radnorshire\" has not been unequivocally established before. However, she now appears to have been the daughter of a Resse Griffiths and the sister of Jeremiah Griffith c1692-c1759; qv Inner Temple admission records; \"First Name: Jeremiah Last Name: Griffith Occupation Given: gentleman Admission Date: 12/02/1713 Call Date: 18/06/1716 Father's Details Name: Resse Griffith Occupation: gentleman Father/Son Relationship: son and heir apparent Address: Diserth Radnorshire Notes: Referred to as Jeremy Griffith in the Bar Book. Father's address described as in \"Parish of Dissearth Wales\".\n\nShe was also of the Inner Temple at her marriage, where she presumably had lodged with her brother before he was called to the Bar.\"Winifred Griffith of The Inner Temple, London, Spinster, Spouse: Peter Smart of Fair Lawne, Kent, Batchelor; source Parish Register St Benet Paul´s Wharf City of London Marriage Date: 7 Apr 1716\"\n\nBefore giving birth to Christopher, Winifred had two daughters, Margaret and Mary Anne.\n\nDuring Smart's younger years, Fairlawne was the residence of Christopher Vane, 1st Baron Barnard and Lady Barnard, who bequeathed £200 to Smart. He is supposed to have received so much money due to his father's closeness to the Vane family, his being named after Christopher Vane, and the young boy was considered \"the pride of Fairlawn\". However, there is some controversy over the exact nature of this inheritance; while some cynically disagree with the reasons for his inheritance, no other explanation has been specified. In 1726, three years after Christopher Vane died, Peter Smart purchased Hall-Place in East Barming, which included a mansion house, fields, orchards, gardens, and woodland, a property that was influential throughout Smart's later life. From the age of four until eleven, he spent much time around the farms, but did not participate, leading to speculations that he suffered from asthma attacks. However, not all scholars agree that he was a \"sickly youth\". The only written record of events during his childhood comes from his writing of a short poem, at the age of four, in which he challenges a rival to the affections of a twelve-year-old girl.\n\nWhile at Hall-Place, Smart was sent to the local Maidstone Grammar School where he was taught by Charles Walwyn, a scholar from Eton College who had received an MA from King's College, Cambridge in 1696. It was here that Smart received an intensive education in Latin and Greek. He did not complete his education at Maidstone however, as his father died on 3 February 1733, and his mother took Smart and his siblings to live near relatives in Durham after selling off a large portion of the estate to pay off Peter Smart's debts.\n\nSmart then attended Durham School, where the Reverend Mr. Richard Dongworth was headmaster; it is not known whether he lived with his uncle, John Smart, or with a school master. He spent vacations at Raby Castle, which was owned by Henry Vane, 1st Earl of Darlington, the grandson of Christopher Vane. Henry Vane and his wife Grace, sister to William and Henrietta Fitzroy the Duke and Duchess of Cleveland, had four children, Henry, Frederick, Anne, and Mary. They were only a few years younger than Smart and became playmates, with Anne and Henry \"pairing off\" with Christopher and his sister Margaret respectively. Although nothing resulted from the match, Anne has been traditionally described as being his \"first love\". During his time with the Vane family, Smart dedicated many poems to Henrietta, the Duchess of Cleveland. It was his closeness with the Vane family along with his skill for learning that encouraged Henrietta to allow him a pension of 40 pounds yearly, continued by her husband after her death in 1742. This allowed Smart to attend Pembroke College, Cambridge.\n\nSmart was admitted to Pembroke College on 20 October 1739 as a sizar under Leonard Addison. Although it is unclear why he chose Pembroke College, Addison was named in Peter Smart's trust deed (1729). As a sizar, he occasionally had to wait on the \"Fellows' table\" and perform other menial tasks. On 12 July 1740, he was awarded the \"Dr. Watt's Foundation scholarship\", which granted him six pounds a year until he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree. In addition to this income, he was also granted four pounds a year for scholarship. Although he was successful academically, he began to run up debt in order to pay for his extravagant lifestyle while at the college.\n\nDuring his time at Pembroke, Smart borrowed numerous books spanning the fields of literature, religion, and science. These works helped when he wrote the three \"Tripos Verse\" at the end of each year. These poems were written in Latin and they, along with his other Latin poems like his translation of Alexander Pope's \"Ode on St. Cecilia's Day\", led to him being awarded the \"Craven scholarship for classics\" on 10 June 1742, which paid ₤25 a year for 14 years. These scholarships, combined with his becoming a fellow in 1743, justified Smart calling himself \"Scholar of the University\".\n\nIn 1743, Smart pushed his translation of Pope's \"Ode on St. Cecilia's Day\" as \"Carmen Cl. Alexandri Pope in S. Caeciliam Latine Redditum\" and paid for the publication himself. With this translation, he wanted to win Pope's favour and translate Pope's \"Essay on Man\", but Pope rejected the idea and, after a lettered response and a possible meeting between the two, Smart translated Pope's \"An Essay on Criticism\" (\"De Arte Critica\") instead. The initial letter sent from Pope recommending the future translation was prized by Smart. In response to this letter and his budding relationship with Pope, the Pembroke Fellows honoured him with a portrait showing him holding the letter from Pope and allowed him to write a poem in celebration of Jubilee of Pembroke's 400th year in 1744.\n\nIn October 1745, Smart was elected Praelector of Philosophy, which paid one pound a year, and made one of three Keepers of the Common Chest. The next year, on 11 February 1746, he became a Master of Arts and was later elected on 10 October 1746, to Praelector of Philosophy, Praelector of Rhetoric, and Keeper of the Common Chest. However, he had run up more debt of over twice his annual income, and he was not re-elected in 1747 to the Praelectorship and was denied his control over the Common Chest accounts. However, he was made a \"Preacher before the Mayor of Cambridge\" at the college under the title \"Concionatori Coram Praetore oppidano\", and his modest living during this year allowed him to regain Praelectorship in Philosophy along with being made a catechist, which suggests that he was ordained in the Anglican church.\n\nIn 1746, Smart became tutor to John Hussey Delaval, but this was abruptly cancelled because Delaval was removed from Pembroke after a variation of broken rules and mischief. After recovering from this, Smart returned to studying. In April 1747, a comedy he wrote just months before, \"A Trip to Cambridge\", or \"The Grateful Fair\", was performed in Pembroke College Hall, with many parts, including female roles, played by Smart himself. The prologue was printed in \"The Cambridge Journal Weekly Flying-Post\", which claimed that the play received \"Universal Applause\".\n\nDuring his final years at Pembroke, Smart was writing and publishing many poems. On 9 January 1748, there were three proposals for \"A Collection of Original Poems, By Christopher Smart, M.A., Fellow of Pembroke Hall, in the University of Cambridge\" that would include \"The Hop Garden\", \"The Judgment of Midas, a Masque\", his odes, his translations into Latin, and some original Latin poems. Thomas Gray, on 17 March 1747, referred to this work as Smart's \"Collection of Odes\". This collection was not printed in 1748 but was delayed until 1752, and was re-titled \"Poems on Several Occasions\".\n\nBetween 1740 and 1746, he was introduced to Harriot Pratt, and he began to write poetry about her. By 1749, he was in love with her and wrote to his friend Charles Burney (father of Fanny Burney), \"I am situated within a mile of my Harriote & Love has robd Friendship of her just dues ... There was a great musical crash at Cambridge, which was greatly admired, but I was not there, being much better pleased with hearing my Harriote on her spinnet & organ at her ancient mansion\", suggesting that he was living permanently in Market Downham, London. Although he wrote many poems dedicated to Harriot, his poem \"The Lass with the Golden Locks\" (1752) claims that he was done with both Harriot, Polly, and other women. The \"lass with the golden locks\" who replaced Smart's previous fancies was Anna Maria Carnan. Anna would be Smart's future wife and she was the stepdaughter of John Newbery, Smart's future publisher.\n\nAlthough Smart seemed to turn his life around at Pembroke, he slowly abandoned the college for London. During 1749, Smart listed himself on Pembroke's \"Liber Absentiae\" and would occasionally return to Pembroke throughout 1749 and 1750. Because of his relationship with those at Pembroke, he was allowed to keep his name in the college's records, which allowed him to participate and be charged as a member of the college. By 1750 he was living near St. James's Park and was busy familiarising himself with Grub Street. It was this year that Smart developed a business relationship with John Newbery. It is unknown how Smart and Newbery met, but Smart's daughter claimed Charles Burney introduced the two. Newbery was looking for a contributory to his \"The Midwife\" and \"The Student\" magazines, and it is possible that Smart's winning of Cambridge's \"Seatonian Prize\" on 25 March 1750 brought his poetic abilities to Newbery's attention.\n\nThe \"Seatonian Prize\" was a contest for one English poem each year on the topic of \"the Perfections or Attributes of the Supreme Being\" and the prize would be the \"Rent of the [Kislingbury, Northamptonshire] estate\" It was established by the will of Thomas Seaton, an \"Anglican divine and hymn writer\". Smart wrote in the \"poetical essay\" tradition using Miltonic blank verse. In 1750, the poem he won the prize with was \"On the Eternity of the Supreme Being\". The prize was only worth 17 pounds each year before 7 pounds were deducted for the publication of the poem. However, after the publication of the poem, Smart became a regular contributor in \"The Student\".\n\n\"The Student\", before Smart's work, was a serious magazine that included a few poems and critical essays. However, once he joined and began writing under many pseudonyms, the magazine became filled with satire, parody, and humorous essays and poems. Along with him composing 15 of the essays and the majority of the poems published in the two volumes of the magazine, he decided to append three of \"The Inspector\", a \"humorous news report\", to the second of the volumes. These reports included many \"puff pieces\" promoting Smart's works along with various stories written by his friends and associates, including the famous writers/poets Henry Fielding, Samuel Johnson, William Collins, and Tobias Smollett. However, this was not the only important publication produced by him during this time.\n\n\"The Midwife\", first published on 16 October 1751 and lasting until April 1753, was produced primarily by Smart while he worked on \"The Student\". This magazine was popular enough to be published in four editions. To hide his identity for practical and humorous reasons, he adopted the persona of a midwife, also known as a \"Mrs. Midwife\" in slang, and called this persona \"Mrs. Mary Midnight\".\n\nWhen his poem \"Night Piece\" was attacked by William Kenrick in \"Kapelion, or Poetical Ordinary\", possibly out of a prearranged publicity stunt, Smart used \"The Midwife\" in December, 1750, to attack back at Kenrick and promised an \"Old Woman's Dunciad\" to be written against the other poet. However, Kenrick beat Smart to the use of the title and printed his own in January, 1751. This feud lasted as attacks published in a few issues of \"The Midwife\", but it soon died out when Smart focused his attention to writing a prologue and epilogue for a production of \"Othello\" and using the magazine to promote it.\n\nHis attention slowly shifted away from \"The Midwife\" when he wrote for, and won, the \"Seatonian Prize\" for his \"On the Immensity of the Supreme Being\" and when he began working with Newbery's children's magazine, \"The Lilliputian Magazine\". However, Smart returned to this character full force when he established \"The Old Woman's Oratory; or Henley in Petticoats\" in December 1751. The \"Oratory\" included Smart playing as Mrs. Midnight, various songs and dances, animal acts, and \"miscellany\" acts. The \"Oratory\" was successful, and was completely redone on 21 January 1752. However, not everyone enjoyed the show, and Horace Walpole described the performance as \"the lowest buffoonery in the world even to me who am used to my uncle Horace.\" Late in 1752, Smart finished and published a collection of his works as \"Poems on Several Occasions\", which resulted in the end of the \"Oratory\" and \"The Midwife\".\n\nIn 1752, Christopher Smart was slowly dragged into a large \"paper war\" that involved many of London's writers. After the publication of \"Poems on Several Occasions\", including \"The Hop-Garden\", in June 1752, John Hill launched a major attack upon Smart's poetry. Smart responded with his mock-epic, \"The Hilliad\". Before the release of Smart's poem, Hill was engaged in a large literary battle between various members of Grub Street's and London's writing community, especially Henry Fielding. This battle may have been for publicity only and lasted over many months before Smart involved himself. However, even with such a late entry, his \"Hilliad\" was the \"loudest broadside\" of the war.\n\nSmart was incurring many debts, and started publishing as much as possible during this time to support his family; he was married to Anna Maria Carnan around mid-1752, and in 1754 already had two daughters, Marianne (3 May 1753) and Elizabeth Anne (27 October 1754). As a married man, he could no longer stay enrolled at Pembroke and collect his scholarship money when his marriage and children were made apparent to the heads of the college. Newbery allowed Smart, along with his wife and their children, to live at Canonbury House, Islington. Although Newbery had a strong reputation for charity, he was determined to have complete control over his writers. It is likely that such an attitude combined with monetary problems led to a rift forming between the two in 1753.\n\nBetween 1753 and 1755, Smart published or republished at least 79 works. However, even if he received money from each of these publications, these publications were unable to provide enough of an income to support a family, especially to his standard of living. While he was producing a poem each year for the \"Seatonian Prize\", this amounted to very little of his writing; he was forced into a life of \"hack work\", which was described by his contemporary, Arthur Murphy, as \"a bookseller is his only friend, but for that bookseller, however liberal, he must toil and drudge.\" In December 1755, he finished \"The Works of Horace, Translated Literally into English Prose\", a translation of Horace, which was widely used but brought him little profit.\n\nHe signed a 99-year contract in November 1755 to produce a weekly paper entitled \"The Universal Visitor or Monthly Memorialist\" for Thomas Gardner and Edmund Allen. However, the strain of publishing caused Smart to suffer from a fit, and he was unable to keep up with the publishing of the paper. Allen was a friend of Samuel Johnson, and it was Samuel Johnson, along with many other friends of Smart, who contributed to the magazine in order to help Smart keep up with his contract. In March 1756, Newbery published without Smart's authority Smart's final \"Seatonian Prize\" poem, \"On the Goodness of the Supreme Being\", and later, on 5 June, Newbery published without Smart's authority Smart's \"Hymn to the Supreme Being\", a poem which thanked God for recovery over an illness of some kind, possibly a \"disturbed mental state\". The \"Hymn to the Supreme Being\" marks the time in Smart's life after the mysterious \"fit\" was resolved and the beginning of Smart's obsession with religion and his praying \"without ceasing\".\n\nA \"Commission of Lunacy\" was taken out against Smart, and he was admitted to St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics on 6 May 1757 as a \"Curable Patient\". It is possible that Smart was confined by Newbery over old debts and a poor relationship between the two; Newbery had previously mocked Smart and his immorality in his \"A Collection of Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High.\" Regardless of the exact reasons, there is evidence suggesting that Newbery's admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on \"madness\". However, there is also evidence that an incident of some kind took place in St. James's Park in which Smart started to pray loudly in public until he had \"routed all the company\" (\"Jubilate Agno\" B89).\n\nIt is not known what exactly happened during his confinement, but Smart did work on two of his most famous poems, \"Jubilate Agno\" and \"A Song to David\". What is known is that he may have been in a private madhouse before St Luke's and that he was later moved from St Luke's to Mr. Potter's asylum until his release. At St Luke's, he transitioned from being \"curable\" to \"incurable\", and was moved to Mr. Potter's asylum for monetary reasons. During this time, Anna left and took the children with her to Ireland. His isolation led him into writing religious poetry, although he abandoned the traditional genres of the 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote \"Jubilate Agno\". Although it is debated as to whether his turning inward to examine himself in his poetry represents an evangelical type of Christianity, his poetry during his isolation does show a desire for \"unmediated revelation\". There is an \"inner light\" that serves as a focal point for Smart and his poems written during this time, and that inner light connects him to the Christian God.\n\nSmart was left alone, except for his cat Jeoffrey and the occasional gawker. It is very possible that he felt \"homeless\" during this time and surely felt that he was in a \"limbo ... between public and private space\". In London, only a few of his works were still being published. However, not everyone viewed Smart's \"madness\" as problematic, and Johnson defended him, sometimes seriously and sometimes comically, many times. A century later, Robert Browning later remarked that \"A Song to David\" was great because Smart was mad, and that the poem allowed him to rank alongside of Milton and Keats. It is no wonder that a few of his loyal friends did come to Mr. Potter's and freed him.\n\nLittle is known as to how and why Smart was released from asylum, but Elizabeth, his daughter, claimed: \"He grew better, and some misjudging friends who misconstrued Mr Newbery's great kindness in placing him under necessary & salutary restriction which might possibly have eventually wrought a cure, invited him to dinner and he returned to his confinement no more.\" Although this may be a misstatement of the events, Smart did leave the asylum on 30 January 1763.\n\n\"A Song to David\" was printed on 6 April 1763 along with a proposal for a new translation of the \"Psalms\". It is said that Smart composed the poem during his second period of confinement to an asylum during an episode of religious mania The poem was received harshly, which was possibly just thinly veiled personal attacks over Smart being freed from the asylum just weeks before. However, Kenrick, Smart's former rival, praised the poem in one of his own printed on 25 May 1763. Also, John Lockman followed on 21 June 1763, with his own poem in praise of Smart's and Samuel Boyce followed this on 15 July 1763 with another. Along with this support, Smart responded to his critics at the \"Critical Review\"; in regards to Smart's response, the \"Critical Review\" claimed that they would \"say no more of Mr. Smart\".\n\nAfter \"A Song to David\", he tried to publish a collection of his \"Psalms\" translations, and Newbery sought to ruin him by hiring James Merrick to produce his own translations. Newbery then hired Smart's new publisher, James Fletcher, which in turn forced Smart to find a new publisher, delaying the printing of his \"Psalms\". Finally, on 12 August 1765, he printed \"A Translation of the Psalms of David\", which included \"Hymns and Spiritual Songs\" and a second edition of \"A Song to David\". This work was criticised by Tobias Smollett who was working with Newbery at the time, and Newbery's edition by Merrick was constantly compared with Smart's. However, modern criticism has received Smart's version in a more favourable light. While working on this project, he was also working on a translation of the \"Phaedrus\" and a verse translation of \"Horace\". His verse \"Horace\" was published in July 1767 including a preface in which he attacked Newbery, but the attack was in vain because Newbery died soon after.\n\nOn 20 April 1770, Smart was arrested for debt. On 11 January 1771, he was tried by Lord Mansfield, the gentleman who originally introduced Smart to Alexander Pope, and he was soon recommended to the King's Bench Prison. Although he was in prison, Charles Burney purchased the \"Rules\" (allowing him some freedom), and Smart's final weeks may have been peaceful although pathetic. In his final letter, Smart begged for money from Rev. Mr. Jackson, saying: \"Being upon recovery from a fit of illness, and having nothing to eat, I beg you to send me two or three shillings which (God willing) I will return, with many thanks, in two or three days.\" On 20 May 1771, Smart died from either liver failure or pneumonia shortly after completing his final work, \"Hymns, for the Amusement of Children\".\n\nIn response to his uncle's death, Christopher Hunter wrote, \"I trust he is now at peace; it was not his portion here.\" Fanny Burney, in her journal, wrote:\n\nOn 22 May 1771, a jury of twelve fellow inmates of the King's Bench Prison declared that Smart \"upon the Twentieth day of May Instant died a Natural Death within the Rules of the Prison.\" He was buried on 26 May in St Paul's Covent Garden.\n\nChristopher Smart received occasional mentions by critics and scholars after his death, especially by Robert Browning, but analysis and commentary on his works increased dramatically with the \"discovery\" of \"Jubilate Agno\" in 1939. Many recent critics approach Smart from a religious perspective (Neil Curry, Harriet Guest, Clement Hawes, Chris Mounsey). However, some also favour a psychology/sexual analysis of his works (Lance Bertelsen, Clemet Hawes, Alan Liu).\n\nAlthough Smart wrote the \"Seatonian Prize\" poems early on, there is a contrast between the mimicked Miltonic blank verse and the intense exploration of religion found in his later works. His first \"Seatonian Prize\" poem, \"On the Eternity of the Supreme Being\" is part of two traditional types of religious writing: \"authoritative discourse of religious poetry\" and \"tentative and self-critical discourse of an apparently more personal devotion\" In connecting the two, he redefines \"the role of the religious poet.\" By establishing a debate between these two forms, Harriet Guest claims that Smart creates \"a poetic space which allows the poet to make provisional, even questionable statements\", which are important to his later works. To Guest, Smart, in his religious poems, \"is not concerned to offer instruction in Christian conduct.\" Besides the greater theological debate, the poems also are the origins of Smart's belief that all of creation is constantly praising God, and that a poet must \"give voice to mute nature's praise of God.\"\n\n\"Jubilate Agno\" reflects an abandonment of traditional poetic structures in order to explore complex religious thought. His \"Let\" verses join creation together as he seemingly writes his own version of Biblical poetry. Smart, in \"Jubilate Agno\", plays on words and the meaning behind words in order to participate with the divine that exists within language. Although the original manuscript divided the \"Let\" and \"For\" verses onto opposing sides of the manuscript, Karina Williams claims that \"Dr W. H. Bond then discovered that some of the LET and FOR folios were numbered and dated concurrently, and that these chronologically parallel texts were further connected by verbal links.\" This justified her combining the two sides to follow each other. Using this as a model, Guest claims that the \"For\" verses explore religion with a \"personal tone\" and the \"Let\" are \"unambiguous\" and deal with public matters. Jeanne Walker goes further than Guest and claims that the \"Let \" and \"For\" sections are united with the Hebrew tradition and \"iterate both present and future simultaneously, that is, they redeem time.\"\n\nWords and language connect the poet to divine revelation, and God is the \"great poet\" who used language in order to create the universe. Through words and language, Smart attempted to capture the creative power of those words. By relying on the power of words, Smart is, according to Clement Hawes, subverting \"Anglican control over religious functions and services.\" In essence, Smart's approach to religion in \"Jubilate Agno\" is comparable to John Wesley's theological dictum and to the writings of John Perro and William Bowling. He also creates his own natural philosophy and criticises science, like that established by Isaac Newton, for their ignoring \"the glory of Almighty God.\"\n\nTo Smart, each piece of matter is alive because it is connected to God, and matter cannot be described in a cold manner that disconnects it from this reality. However, Smart accomplished his new science by relying on Newtonian empiricism. As part of his desire to bring back the divine language to poetry and science, he creates an \"Ark of Salvation\" in order to describe a prophetic and apocalyptic future which emphasises the importance of Christ and England. Along with being prophetic, the poem itself is modelled after the canticles and follows the form of the Benedicite. The Benedicite is not the only model however, and there is a strong link between \"Jubilate Agno\" and the psalm tradition.\n\nSmart's \"A Song to David\" is an attempt to bridge poetry written by humans and Biblical poetry. The Biblical David plays an important role in this poem just as he played an important role in \"Jubilate Agno\" However, David in \"Jubilate Agno\" is an image of the creative power of poetry whereas he becomes a fully realised model of the religious poet. By focusing on David, Smart is able to tap into the \"heavenly language.\" Many critics have focused on the role of David as planner of Solomon's Temple and his possible role with the Freemasons. However, the true life of the poem comes later when Christ is introduced as the major subject. After Christ is introduced, Smart attempts to \"reach to heaven\" and the final passages, to Neil Curry, represent a \"final rush for glory.\"\n\nAccording to Mounsey, \"A Song to David\" and Smart's \"Psalms\" is an attempt to \"Christianize\" the Old Testament through writing an 18th-century psalter. However, the \"Psalms\" perform a secondary function: they allow Smart to relate to the suffering of David and to reinforce his own religious convictions by following his Biblical model. As part of Smart's \"Christianizing\" of the \"Psalms\", Jesus becomes a divine form of suffering, and Smart becomes further juxtaposed with his Biblical model as both praise God for Jesus's ultimate sacrifice and for the beauty of all creation. The \"Hymns\" and \"Psalms\" form their own sort of liturgy and attempt to reform Anglican liturgy by emphasising God's place in nature.\n\nSmart's \"Hymns\" are modelled after a tradition exemplified by Robert Nelson. They are steeped in Anglican tradition and also emphasise English patriotism and England's divine favour. The \"Hymns\", according to Guest, \"[express] a delight in creation that is largely absent from the work of other hymn-writers of the century, unless they are paraphrasing the words of David.\" To Hawes, the \"Hymns\" exemplify an evangelical spirit that separates Smart from the traditional Anglican church. Although he wrote his second set of hymns, \"Hymns for the Amusement of Children\", for a younger audience, Smart cares more about emphasising the need for children to be moral instead of \"innocent\". These works have been seem as possibly too complicated for \"amusement\" because they employee ambiguities and complicated theological concepts. In essence, the \"Hymns for the Amusement of Children\" is intended to teach children the specific virtues that make up the subject matter of the work. Like the \"Hymns for the Amusement of Children\", Smart's \"The Parables of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ\" were designed to teach morals. However, these \"Parables\" alter the original Biblical parables in order to simplify them and help them \"make sense\" As such, Todd Parker claims that the \"Parables\", and the other religious works of Smart, are part of his final push for the \"evangelization of London's reading public.\"\n\nThe language and commentary on language is of particular emphasis in \"Jubilate Agno\". To Alan Jacobs, Smart's use of language represents his attempt to connect to the \"Ur language\", allowing Smart to connect to \"the Word calling forth the world.\" This is similar to David and Orpheus's ability as poets to create through their song. In his constant emphasis on the force of poetry, \"Jubilate Agno\" takes on the qualities of the \"Ars Poetica\" tradition. As such, Smart is attempting to develop a poetic language that will connect him to the \"one true, eternal poem.\" The poetic language that he creates is related to Adam's \"onomathetic\" tradition, or the idea that names hold significant weight in the universe and that Adam was able to join in with creation by naming objects.\n\nIn \"Jubilate Agno\", he describes his writing as creating \"impressions\". To accomplish this task, he incorporated puns and onomonpoeia in order to emphasise theological significance of his poetic language. In addition to these techniques, he relied on repeated language and allusions to traditional works and to scripture for a source of authority in various works, especially in his \"Hymns\". Along with scriptural authority, he relies on prophetic rhetoric to gain his audience's sympathy.\n\nDuring the 18th century, there was a debate over poetic language and the translations of Smart, especially of Horace, positioned him as one who sought to redeem traditional forms and understanding of language. However, some critics, like Alan Liu, believe that translations are effectively forced to compete against the original works, and that Smart's language, at least in his translations, must constantly seek to undermine the original authors, like Horace. Not all critics agree with Liu, and those like Donald Davie believe that the Smart's translations cannot be compared to the original works, but are part of a system of Smart competing against the language of his contemporaries. Thomas Keymer further verified this point about Smart's translations by revealing that the poet claims, in William Toldervy's \"The History of Two Orphans\", \"But what heaven-exciting harmony might we not expect from that exalted genius, who can produce such lines as these following!\" in anticipation of replacing the previous flawed translations of the \"Psalms\".\n\nRegardless of where he stood on the specific issue of translation Smart believed that there was an importance to language, which carried over to his constant revising of his poems to slowly correct them. Many of Smart's poems served a dual purpose, and when put to music were altered to meet various standards. By constantly revising, he ensured that his poems were always the \"authentic\" version.\n\nSmart's role as Mrs. Midnight along with his gendered comments in \"Jubilate Agno\" form the focal point for analysing his understanding of sexuality and gender. With Mrs. Midnight, Smart challenges the traditional social order found in 18th-century England. However, some, like Lance Bertelsen, claim that the Mrs. Midnight persona reveals Smart's schizophrenia in which he is torn between masculine and feminine roles. Fraser Easton claims that the existence of Mrs. Midnight proves that Smart identified a female connection to poetry and her character was used to defy popular 18th-century notions of who is able to attain knowledge. This role allowed Smart to focus on \"social and sexual dimensions\" in his satire. However, there is a potentially darker side to Mrs. Midnight, and she could represent his feelings that he was \"emasculated by economic pressures.\"\n\nThe image of \"horns\" in \"Jubilate Agno\" is commonly viewed as a sexual image. Easton puts particular emphasis on the image of horns as a phallic image and contends that there are masculine and feminine horns throughout Smart's poem. Hawes picks up this theme and goes on to claims that the poem shows \"that [Smart] had been 'feminized' as a cuckold.\" In response to this possible cuckolding, \"Jubilate Agno\" predicts a misogynistic future while simultaneously undermining this effort with his constant associations to female creation.\n\nSmart had a reputation for being a \"dedicated gardener\". His poem the \"Hop-Garden\" helped to further this reputation, and even during his stay in a mental asylum he convinced others of his bond with nature. Johnson witnessed Smart's time in asylum and stated, \"he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden.\" Gardening, to Smart, was a way in which humans could interact with nature and actually \"improve\" on the natural landscape.\n\nHowever, Smart did not only write about gardens and vegetation, and his focus on his cat \"Jeoffry\" is widely known and his focus on nature connects him to those mistreated and neglected by 18th-century society. The first fragment of \"Jubilate Agno\" is a poetic \"Ark\" that pairs humans with animals in order to purify all of creation. The whole work relies on his extensive background in botany and his knowledge of taxonomy. Smart actively participated in the 18th-century taxonomy systems established by Carl Linnaeus; however, Smart is mythologising his view of nature and creation when he adds information from Pliny the Elder into his work.\n\nBy using this knowledge, Smart was able to give a \"voice\" to nature; he believed that nature, like his cat Jeoffry, is always praising God but needs a poet in order to bring out that voice. As such, themes of animals and language are merged in \"Jubilate Agno\", and Jeoffry is transformed into a manifestation of the \"Ars Poetica\" tradition.\n\nMany critics have focused on the role of David as planner of Solomon's Temple and his possible role with the Freemasons. Although it is not known for sure whether Christopher was a Freemason or not, there is evidence suggesting that he was either part of the organisation or had a strong knowledge of its belief system. Based on personal admittance to contributing to \"A Defence of Freemasonry\", contemporary verification of his participation in the volume and with Masonic meetings, there is enough to confirm \"his participation in Masonic affairs.\" Furthermore, there are accounts of Smart attending meetings at the Bell Tavern in Westminster. The information available has led Marie Roberts to declare in her 1986 book \"British Poets and Secret Societies\", \"It has been universally accepted by scholars that Christopher Smart ... was a Freemason yet no record of his membership has been traced.\" However, in the notes to Chris Mounsey's 2001 book \"Christopher Smart: Clown of God\", Marie Roberts' 1986 book is referred to as \"an account of Smart's work which accepts his association with the Freemasons,\" but in Mounsey's view, \"Since neither Smart's name nor his pseudonyms appear in the records of the Freemasons, it is highly unlikely he was ever one of their number.\"\n\nSmart's involvement with Masonry can be traced through his poems, including \"Jubilate Agno\" and \"A Song to David\", with his constant references to Masonic ideas and his praise of Free Masonry in general. In \"Jubilate Agno\", Smart declares \"I am the Lord's builder and free and accepted MASON in CHRIST JESUS\" (B 109). This declaration of being a \"free and accepted MASON\" has been interpreted to define his connection to speculative Masonry. The \"in Christ Jesus\" declaration places Smart within a Christian version of Masonry. He also declares himself as \"the Lord's builder\" and this connects his life with the building of King Solomon's Temple, an important Masonic idea. In \"A Song to David\", Smart returns to the building of Solomon's Temple and incorporates many of the Masonic images that he uses in \"Jubilate Agno\".\n\nIt was this detail that encouraged many critics to try and decode the \"seven pillar\" section of \"A Song of David\" along the lines of Masonic imagery. The poem follows two traditional sets of motions common to Freemason writing that mimic the image of Jacob's Ladder: movement from earth to heaven and movement from heaven to earth. This image further connects Freemason belief surrounding the relationship of David to Solomon's Temple. While these images, and further images in \"A Song to David\" are related also to depictions of the Temple in Isaac Newton's \"Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended\" (1728), the John Bunyan's \"Solomon's Temple Spiritualiz'd\" (1688), and to the Geneva Bible, these works were relied on by the Freemasons.\n\nBased on this theory, the first pillar, the Greek alpha, represents the mason's compass and \"God as the Architect of the Universe.\" The second, the Greek gamma, represents the mason's square. In addition, the square represents the \"vault of heaven.\" The third, the Greek eta, represents Jacob's ladder itself and is connected to the complete idea of seven pillars. The fourth, the Greek theta, is either \"the all-seeing eye or the point within a circle.\" The fifth letter, the Greek iota, represents a pillar and the temple. The sixth letter, the Greek sigma, is an incomplete hexagram, otherwise known as \"the blazing star or hexalpha\" to the Freemasons. The last, the Greek omega, represents a lyre and David as a poet.\n\nSmart, throughout his career, published many known works. Although his works are far too many to list, a few of his most famous and important publications during his life include:\n\n\nOne of his most famous poems, \"Jubilate Agno\", was not published until 1939, by William Force Stead. In 1943, lines from this poem were set to music by Benjamin Britten with the translated title \"Rejoice in the Lamb\".\n\nHe is also credited with the writing of \"A Defence of Freemasonry\" (1765), also known as \"A Defence of Freemasonry as practised in the regular lodges, both foreign and domestic, under the Constitution of the English Grand Master, in which is contained a refutation of Mr. Dermott's absurd and ridiculous account of Freemasonry, in his book entitled 'Ahiman Rezon' and the several quries therein reflecting on the regular Masons, briefly considered and answered\", that response to Laurence Dermott's \"Ahiman Rezon\". Although there is no direct attribution on the text's titlepage, it was established as his work since its publication, and it includes a poem directly attributed to him.\n\nA two-volume edition of the \" Complete Poems of Christopher Smart \" was published in 1949 by Norman Callan, Professor of English at Queen Mary College, London (now University).

{"id": "797486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=797486", "title": "Climatic Research Unit", "text": "Climatic Research Unit\n\nThe Climatic Research Unit (CRU) is a component of the University of East Anglia and is one of the leading institutions concerned with the study of natural and anthropogenic climate change.\n\nWith a staff of some thirty research scientists and students, the CRU has contributed to the development of a number of the data sets widely used in climate research, including one of the global temperature records used to monitor the state of the climate system, as well as statistical software packages and climate models.\n\nThe CRU was founded in 1971 as part of the university's School of Environmental sciences. The establishment of the Unit owed much to the support of Sir Graham Sutton, a former Director-General of the Meteorological Office, Lord Solly Zuckerman, an adviser to the University, and Professors Keith Clayton and Brian Funnel, Deans of the School of Environmental Sciences in 1971 and 1972. Initial sponsors included British Petroleum, the Nuffield Foundation and Royal Dutch Shell. The Rockefeller Foundation was another early benefactor, and the Wolfson Foundation gave the Unit its current building in 1986. Since the second half of the 1970s the Unit has also received funding through a series of contracts with the United States Department of Energy to support the work of those involved in climate reconstruction and analysis of the effects on climate of greenhouse gas emissions. The UK Government (Margaret Thatcher) became a strong supporter of climate research in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe first director of the unit was Professor Hubert Lamb, who had previously led research into climatic variation at the Met Office. He was then known as the \"ice man\" for his prediction of global cooling and a coming ice age but, following the UK's exceptionally hot summer of 1976, he switched to predicting a more imminent global warming. The possibility of major weather changes and flooding attracted attention to the unit and sponsorship by major insurance companies wanting to mitigate their potential losses. Prior to the Unit's establishment, it had widely been believed by the meteorological establishment that the climate was essentially constant and unvarying. Lamb and others in the climatological community had for years argued that the climate system was in fact highly variable on timescales of decades to centuries and longer. The establishment of the CRU enabled Lamb and his colleagues to focus on this issue and eventually to win the argument decisively.\n\nHubert Lamb retired in 1978. His successors were Tom Wigley (1978–1993), Trevor Davies (1993–1998), Jean Palutikof and Phil Jones (jointly 1998–2004), Phil Jones (2004–2016), and Tim Osborn (from January 2017); Peter Liss was acting director during investigations between December 2009 and July 2010. In 1984, the unit moved to a new cylindrical building designed by Rick Mather. In 2006, this was named the \"Hubert Lamb Building\" in honour of the first director.\n\nAt the time of its establishment the CRU set out four key aims, which still remain valid:\n\n\nCRU produces a range of climate datasets, covering temperature, precipitation, pressure and circulation, both global and regional. One of the CRU's most significant products is the CRUTEM global dataset of land near-surface temperature anomalies on a 5° by 5° grid-box basis, which is compiled in conjunction with the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research and its sea-surface temperature dataset to produce the HadCRUT temperature record. First compiled in the early 1980s, the record documents global temperature fluctuations since the 1850s. The CRU compiles the land component of the record and the Hadley Centre provides the marine component. The merged record is used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in all its publications. Other products include the CRU TS high resolution gridded land surface dataset of multiple factors including precipitation, vapour pressure and cloud cover as well as temperatures.\n\nCRU is also involved in a study of Eurasian climate over the last 10,000 years based upon tree ring data and a study of European climate in the last 200 years based upon temperature records. It is a participant in MEDALUS – the Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use project. The custodians of the raw data are the that originated the data; CRU retains most but not all of the raw data, which continues to be held by the originating services.\n\nIt published a quarterly journal, \"Climate Monitor\". This ceased publication in 1998, being replaced by an online version, \"Climate Monitor Online\".\n\nThe CRU collates data from many sources around the world. In August 2009 its director, Phil Jones, told the science journal \"Nature\" that he was working to make the data publicly available with the agreement of its owners but this was expected to take some months, and objections were anticipated from National Meteorological Organisations that made money from selling the data. It was not free to share that data without the permission of its owners because of confidentiality agreements, including with institutions in Spain, Germany, Bahrain and Norway, that restricted the data to academic use. In some cases the agreements were made orally, and some of the written agreements had been lost during a move. Despite this, the CRU was the focus of numerous requests under the Freedom of Information Act for data used by the unit's scientists. \"Nature\" reported that in the course of five days in July 2009 the CRU had been \"inundated\" with 58 FOI requests from Stephen McIntyre and people affiliated with his Climate Audit blog requesting access to raw climate data or information about their use.\n\nIn early 2011 a large amount of raw weather station data had been released by the Met Office and the US Global Historical Climatology Network, but around two-thirds of the data owners did not respond to the CRU requests for agreement, and both Poland and Trinidad and Tobago declined. Two FOIA requests for data shared with another researcher were refused by the university, and the requestors appealed this to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). In its decision released on 23 June 2011, the ICO required CRU to release the remaining raw data irrespective of the wishes of the meteorological organisations which owned the data. This decision included data from Trinidad and Tobago but did not cover Poland. The raw data release was completed by 27 July 2011.\n\nIn November 2009, hackers gained access to a server used by the CRU and stole a large quantity of data, anonymously posting online more than 1,000 emails and more than 2,000 other documents. Some climate change sceptics including bloggers asserted that a number of the leaked e-mails contain evidence supporting their global warming conspiracy theory that scientists had allegedly conspired to manipulate data and to keep scientists who have contrary views out of peer-review literature. This controversy was dubbed \"Climategate\".\n\nA series of independent public investigations of the allegations found no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct. The Muir Russell report exonerated the scientists, but found \"a consistent pattern of failing to display the proper degree of openness, both on the part of CRU scientists and on the part of the UEA\". The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged.\n\nIn 2011, a new analysis of temperature data by the independent Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature group, many of whom had stated publicly that they thought it was possible that the CRU had manipulated data, concluded that \"these studies were done carefully and that potential biases identified by climate change sceptics did not seriously affect their conclusions\".\n\n\n"}

They have also found that if the radiation is \"fractionated\" into smaller doses, with one or more rest periods in between, fewer cells die. This is because of self-repair mechanisms which repair the damage to DNA and other biomolecules such as proteins. These mechanisms can be over expressed in cancer cells, so caution should be used in using results for a cancer cell line to make predictions for healthy cells if the cancer cell line is known to be resistant to cytotoxic drugs such as cisplatin. The DNA self repair processes in some organisms is exceptionally good; for instance, the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans can tolerate a 15 000 Gy (1.5 MRad) dose.\n\nIn the graph to the right, called a cell survival curve, the dose vs. surviving fraction have been drawn for a hypothetical group of cells with and without a rest time for the cells to recover. Other than the recovery time partway through the irradiation, the cells would have been treated identically.\n\nThe human body contains many types of cells, and the human can be killed by the loss of a single type of cells in a vital organ. For many short-term radiation deaths due to what is commonly known as radiation sickness (3 to 30 days after exposure), it is the loss of bone marrow cells (which produce blood cells), and the loss of other cells in the wall of the intestines, that is fatal.\n\nFractionation effects are utilised in the treatment of cancer with radiation therapy. When the total dose of radiation is divided into several, smaller doses over a period of several days, there are fewer toxic effects on healthy cells. This maximizes the effect of radiation on cancer and minimizes the negative side effects. A typical fractionation scheme divides the dose into 30 units delivered every weekday over six weeks.\n\nHypofractionation is a treatment regimen that delivers higher doses of radiation in fewer visits. The logic behind this treatment is that applying greater amounts of radiation works to lower the effects of accelerated tumor growth that typically occurs during the later stages of radiotherapy.\n\nHyperfractionation is dividing the same total dose into more deliveries. Treatments are given more than once a day. Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is given over the same period of time (days or weeks) as standard radiation therapy.\n\nAccelerated fractionation (two deliveries per day and/or deliveries on weekends as well) has also been investigated.\n"}

The film begins in the Arctic in January of one year and moves southward, concluding in Antarctica in the December of the same year. Along the way, it features the journeys made by three particular species—the polar bear, African bush elephant and humpback whale—to highlight the threats to their survival in the face of rapid environmental change. A companion piece to the 2006 BBC/Discovery television series \"Planet Earth\", the film uses many of the same sequences, though most are edited differently, and features previously unseen footage.\n\n\"Earth\" was co-directed by Alastair Fothergill, the executive producer of the television series, and Mark Linfield, the producer of \"Planet Earth\"s \"From Pole to Pole\" and \"Seasonal Forests\" episodes. It was co-produced by BBC Natural History Unit and Greenlight Media, with Discovery providing some of the funding. In North America, the film was released by Disneynature, the first film under Disney's recently formed nature film label. The same organisations collaborated on Fothergill's previous film, \"Deep Blue\" (2003), itself a companion to his 2001 television series on the natural history of the world's oceans, \"The Blue Planet\". The British version of \"Earth\" was narrated by Patrick Stewart and the US version was narrated by James Earl Jones.\n\n\"Earth\" was released in cinemas internationally during the final quarter of 2007 and throughout 2008. With total worldwide box office revenue exceeding $100 million, \"Earth\" is the second-highest-grossing nature documentary of all time.\n\nA sequel, titled \"Earth: One Amazing Day\", was released in the United States on 6 October 2017. It made its world premiere in Beijing.\n\nOver the course of a calendar year, \"Earth\" takes the viewer on a journey from the North Pole in January to the South in December, revealing how plants and animals respond to the power of the sun and the changing seasons. The film focuses on three particular species, the polar bear, African bush elephant and humpback whale.\n\nStarting in the high Arctic in January, as the darkness of winter gives way to the sun, a mother polar bear is shown emerging from her den with two new cubs. She needs food and must lead her cubs to her hunting ground on the sea ice before it begins to break up. By April, the sun never sets, and by August all the sea ice has melted. The mother and cubs have retreated to dry land, but a male polar bear is trapped at sea and must seek out land by swimming. He reaches an island with a walrus colony but is too exhausted to make a successful kill. He dies from injuries sustained in a walrus attack.\n\nAfrican bush elephants are filmed from the air as they negotiate a dust storm in the Kalahari Desert. June is the dry season and they must follow ancient paths passed down through generations to reach watering holes. A mother and calf are separated from the herd in the storm but manage to reach shelter. The matriarch leads the herd to a temporary watering hole, but they must share it with hungry lions and scavenger white-backed vultures. The lions are shown attacking a solitary elephant at night, when their superior vision gives them the upper hand. The herd times its arrival at the Okavango Delta to coincide with seasonal floodwaters which transform the desert into a lush water world.\n\nA humpback whale mother and calf are filmed from the air and underwater at their breeding grounds in the shallow seas of the tropics. There is nothing here for the mother to eat, so she must guide her calf on a journey south to the rich feeding grounds near Antarctica, the longest migration of any marine mammal. En route, they navigate dangerous seas where great white sharks are filmed breaching as they hunt. Sea lions, and sailfish and dolphins combine to bait a shoal of small fish. By October they enter polar waters, and by December the Antarctic sun has melted the sea ice to form sheltered bays. Here, the whales are shown feeding on krill by trapping them in bubble nets.\n\nThe stories of these individual creatures are woven into the film alongside a great many additional scenes. The supporting cast of animals include mandarin ducklings filmed jumping from their tree hole nest, Arctic wolves hunting caribou, cheetah hunting Thomson's gazelle, elephants charging at white-backed vulture, birds of paradise displaying in the New Guinea rainforest, Adelie penguins in the Antarctic and demoiselle cranes on their autumn migration across the Himalayas.\n\nTime-lapse photography is used to show the blossoming of spring flowers, seasonal changes to deciduous forests, clouds sweeping up Himalayan valleys, and the growth of jungle spores and fungi.\n\nThe narration is woven around the theme of anthropogenic environmental change. The three species it features are used to illustrate particular threats to the planet's wildlife. In the Arctic, rising temperatures are causing a greater area of sea ice to melt and threatening the polar bear with extinction as early as 2030. Global warming is also disrupting the planet's weather systems and making seasonal rainfall patterns less predictable. This poses a threat to creatures like elephants, which must travel greater distances to reach water. Rising ocean temperatures have started to kill the plankton on which humpback whales and most other sea life depend. The film ends with the message that \"it's not too late to make a difference.\"\n\n\"Earth\" was produced by Alix Tidmarsh of BBC Worldwide and Sophokles Tasioulis of Greenlight Media. Following \"Deep Blue\", it is the second film of a five-picture deal between the two companies. The process of bringing \"Planet Earth\" and \"Earth\" to the screen took over five years. With a budget of $47 million, the film was the most expensive production in the history of documentary filmmaking at the time, later to be surpassed by \"Oceans\". Principal photography began in 2004 and was completed in 2006.\n\n\"Earth\" received its world premiere at Spain's San Sebastián International Film Festival in September 2007. It was released across Europe in the fourth quarter of 2007 and early 2008 to much success. In April 2008, it was announced that \"Earth\" would be the first feature released by Disneynature, a newly-formed film unit of the Walt Disney Studios, specialising in natural history documentaries since \"True-Life Adventures\". The film was released in the US on April 22, 2009, with James Earl Jones narrating in place of Patrick Stewart. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures also handled distribution in Canada and Latin American countries. Outside of those territories, the film's distribution rights were sold to various independent distributors including; Lionsgate in the UK and Australia, Gaumont in France, and Universum Film AG in Germany.\n\nIn addition to replacing Patrick Stewart with James Earl Jones as a narrator, the U.S. version uses a more dramatic soundtrack and runs only 90 minutes, compared to the original cut's 99 minutes.\n\nRotten Tomatoes reported that 87% of critics gave the film positive reviews based on 91 reviews, the second-highest score of all the Disneynature films (behind \"Monkey Kingdom\", which has a score of 93%), with an average score of 7.2 out of 10. Its consensus stated: \"With its spectacular and extensive footage, \"Earth\" is both informative and entertaining.\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, gave an average score of 72, being a generally favourable review, based on 26 reviews.\n\nOn its first day of release in the US, \"Earth\" opened at #1, grossing $4,023,788 from 1,810 theaters. For its first weekend, it opened at #5, grossing $8,825,760, as well as $14,472,792 over the five-day period. Despite dropping to #7 the next weekend, taking in $4,340,235, it took in $12,017,017 over the previous week (including Sunday), and ending up with a two-week total of $22,004,284. It closed on July 30, 2009 after 100 days of release, ending up with a final gross of $32,011,576, making it a modest success in the US.\n\n\"Earth\" picked up an additional $76,931,115 at the international box office. It took over $30 million in Germany alone, became one of the three highest-grossing films of the year in France and had the best opening of any natural history documentary in Spain. By contrast, in the UK \"Earth\" debuted on just 14 screens and amassed less than £75,000 in ticket sales.\n\nIn January 2008, the Japanese version of \"Earth\", narrated by actor Ken Watanabe, knocked Hollywood blockbuster \"I Am Legend\" off the top of the box office despite opening on half the number of screens. It went on to gross more than 2 billion yen ($18.5 million), making it the most successful documentary there of the last 10 years.\n\nIts worldwide total of $108,942,691 made \"Earth\" a commercial success and placed it second on the all-time list of highest-grossing nature documentaries, behind \"March of the Penguins\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6733355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6733355", "title": "Fieldstone", "text": "Fieldstone\n\nFieldstone is a naturally occurring type of stone, which lay at or near the surface of the Earth. Fieldstones were a nuisance for farmers seeking to expand their farms, but at some point these stones started being used as a construction material. Strictly speaking, it is stone collected from the surface of fields where it occurs naturally. Collections of fieldstones which have been removed from arable land or pasture to allow for more effective agriculture are called clearance cairns.\n\nIn practice, fieldstone is any architectural stone used in its natural shape and can be applied to stones recovered from the topsoil or subsoil. Although fieldstone is generally used to describe such material when used for exterior walls, it has come to include its use in other ways including garden features and interiors. It is sometimes cut or split for use in architecture.\n\nFieldstone is common in soils throughout temperate latitudes due to glacial deposition. The type of field stones left through glaciation, are known as glacial erratics. In Canada and the northern United States, the advance of the Laurentide ice sheet pulverized bedrock, and its retreat deposited several dozen meters of unsorted till in previously glaciated areas as far south as New England and the Upper Midwest. \n\nAlthough a coarse layer of glacial ablation would settle on top of the deeper lodgment till, it was these more deeply set stones that would prove a persistent challenge for settled human agriculture because they would be frost-churned into surface soils during harsh winters.\n\nLarge collections of fieldstone can be found at the edge of the last glacial period also known as the Wisconsin Glaciation. These edges are known as terminal moraines. Large deposits are found at the end of these glacial advances. In The northeastern United States there are some of the largest deposits caused by terminal moraines which are known to exist from the last glacial period. As such, field stone buildings and rock walls envelope the landscape.\n\nSettled agriculture requires relatively fine and uniform soils for intensive use, and large rocks pose additional risks for agricultural machinery, which they can damage if not removed. Because the stones are widely disseminated, removing fieldstone is a widespread and costly activity in early agricultural settlement. To prepare fields for cultivation, farmers would need to remove these stones, which requires significant manual labor. Until the 19th century, fieldstone was removed exclusively by hand, often with whole families participating in this task. Depending on the harshess of winters, this task would need to be repeated whenever frost levels would churn new stones into soil surfaces. Thus, land with many fieldstones was and is considered marginal and is assessed for tax purposes well below land that is considered stone-free.\n\nIn mechanized agriculture, fieldstone is usually removed by a tractor attachment called a rock picker. A chain-driven wheel rotates a graded scoop picking surface rocks from the soil and shakes off excess soil. A hydraulic lift then tilts and empties the rock bucket, usually along the perimeter of the farm. Washed and split, field rock is considered an attractive landscape and building material, and can be expensive at building supply stores.\n\nFieldstone became abundant throughout New England and Eastern Canada as European settlers began to clearcut forests for timber, wood fuel, and agricultural expansion. Although settled agriculture and timber extraction began as early as 1620 in coastal areas, large-scale clear-cutting began in the late 18th century with increased immigration and inland settlement. Fuel and material demands led to the near-complete deforestation of the region. Cleared soils were subject to deeper freezing, which caused frost-churned stones to rise to the soil surfaces. When the virgin land was tilled, the fields were littered with rocks. Abundant and not as portable or versatile as other fencing materials, these stones were moved to the edge of the fields and stacked into stone walls, for which New England is now well-known. \n\nEach spring, the stone walls were added to when the fields were plowed, as more stones were brought to the surface following the winter freeze and the spring thaw. The greatest number of these walls were stacked between 1775 and 1825, but efforts to repair and extend these walls continued throughout the 19th century. According to an 1871 agricultural census, over were constructed throughout the region, representing 40 million days of human labor. As agricultural production moved westward, areas of New England have since reforested.\n\nFieldstone occurs extensively on the High Plains. On or near the surface, fieldstones come in many colors, and are limited in size to about 4 feet in diameter, although larger rocks are sometimes recovered. Pretty and colorful, fieldstones are used occasionally as building materials; some of the more stately homes on the Prairies are constructed of fieldstone and are over a century old. However, fieldstone as a building material is very much underused.\n\n"}
{"id": "20533339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20533339", "title": "Fugitive emission", "text": "Fugitive emission\n\nFugitive emissions are emissions of gases or vapors from pressurized equipment due to leaks and other unintended or irregular releases of gases, mostly from industrial activities. As well as the economic cost of lost commodities, fugitive emissions contribute to air pollution and climate change. A detailed inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from upstream oil and gas activities in Canada for the year 2000 estimated that fugitive equipment leaks had a global warming potential equivalent to the release of 17 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or 12 per cent of all greenhouse gases emitted by the sector. Venting of natural gas, flaring, accidental releases and storage losses accounted for an additional 38 per cent.\n\nFugitive emissions present other risks and hazards. Emissions of volatile organic compounds such as benzene from oil refineries and chemical plants pose a long term health risk to workers and local communities. In situations where large amounts of flammable liquids and gases are contained under pressure, leaks also increase the risk of fire and explosion.\n\nLeaks from pressurized process equipment generally occur through valves, pipe connections, mechanical seals, or related equipment. Fugitive emissions also occur at evaporative sources such as waste water treatment ponds and storage tanks. Because of the huge number of potential leak sources at large industrial facilities and the difficulties in detecting and repairing some leaks, fugitive emissions can be a significant proportion of total emissions. Though the quantities of leaked gases may be small, gases that have serious health or environmental impacts can cause a significant problem.\n\nTo minimize and control leaks at process facilities operators carry out regular leak detection and repair activities. Routine inspections of process equipment with gas detectors can be used to identify leaks and estimate the leak rate in order to decide on appropriate corrective action. Proper routine maintenance of equipment reduces the likelihood of leaks.\n\nBecause of the technical difficulties and costs of detecting and quantifying actual fugitive emissions at a site or facility, and the variability and intermittent nature of emission flow rates, bottom-up estimates based on standard emission factors are generally used for annual reporting purposes.\n\nNew technologies are under development that could revolutionize the detection and monitoring of fugitive emissions. One technology, known as differential absorption lidar (DIAL), can be used to remotely measure concentration profiles of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere up to several hundred meters from a facility. DIAL has been used for refinery surveys in Europe for over 15 years. A pilot study carried out in 2005 using DIAL found that actual emissions at a refinery were fifteen times higher than those previously reported using the emission factor approach. The fugitive emissions were equivalent to 0.17% of the refinery throughput.\n\nPortable gas leak imaging cameras are also a new technology that can be used to improve leak detection and repair, leading to reduced fugitive emissions. The cameras use infrared imaging technology to produce video images in which invisible gases escaping from leak sources can be clearly identified.\n\n\n"}

It is vitreous, pale yellow to bright lemon yellow, brittle, and features a prismatic to acicular crystal habit along [001] and somewhat flattened crystal habit on {110}. It was first encountered in 1984 at the Pinch Mineralogical Museum. One specimen of dietzeite from Oficina Chacabuco, Chile had bright lemon-yellow micronodules on it. These crystals produced an X-ray powder diffraction pattern that did not match any XRD data listed for inorganic compounds. The X-ray diffraction pattern and powder mount were set aside until 1994. By then, the entire mineral collection from the Pinch Mineralogical Museum had been purchased by the Canadian Museum of Nature. The specimen was then retrieved and studied further. This study was successful and the new mineral george-ericksenite was discovered. The mineral was named for George E. Ericksen who was a research economic geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey for fifty years. The mineral and name have been approved by Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names (IMA). The specimen, polished thin section, and the actual crystal used for the structure determination are kept in the Display Series of the National Mineral Collection of Canada at the Canadian Museum of Nature, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nGeorge-ericksonite is commonly found as isolated bright lemon-yellow micronodules of crystals that are concentrated on the surface of one part of the mineral specimen. However, in some cases the micronodules occur as groupings instead of isolated occurrences. The average size of these micronodules is approximately 0.2 mm and each consists of numerous individual crystals in random orientation.\n\nThis examination was carried out by attaching two acicular crystals to the surface of a disk with epoxy and then examining them with a CAMECA SX-50 electron microprobe. One of the crystals had the (100) surface facing up, and the other crystal had a growth face of the form (110) facing up. The microprobe was operating in wavelength-dispersive mode at 15 kV and ran various currents from 20 nA to 0.5 nA. The CAMECA SX-50 has three spectrometers and the samples were examined in the sequence (Na, Cl, I), then (Mg, S, Ca). When the crystal was exposed to the electron beam for the first 200 seconds, the counts per second on each element varied greatly which indicates that the crystals are extremely unstable in the electron beam. The counts per second for each element were also dependent on the surface of the crystal [(100) or (110)] analyzed. Over shorter counting times (<10 s) at 15 kV and 5 nA, there is a gain in IO and a drop in NaO relative to ideal values. However, a significant orientation effect exists for SO and CaO values for the (100) and (110) surfaces on either side of the ideal values. With increasing exposure to the electron beam, NaO increases and all other oxides decrease. This behavior is also more rapid on the (100) surface than on the (110) crystal face. The (100) surface is overall more reactive to the electron beam than the (110) surface, but both surfaces seem to approach equilibrium with the beam and give similar oxides weight percentages after 200 seconds.\n\nEven at low currents and short counting times george-ericksenite is extremely unstable under the electron beam. After examination, the crystal faces are stained brown from the reaction with I and the decrease in analyzed IO with increasing time. The crystallographic orientation of the material analyzed has a large impact on the analytical values at any given time. The overall quantitative behavior of george-ericksenite in the electron beam is consistent with the chemical composition derived (ideally IO 59.13, CrO 9.92. SO 1.51, MgO 2.38, CaO 3.31, NaO 10.98, HO 12.77 weight %).\n\nA 0.046 X 0.059 X 0.060 mm crystal was mounted on a Siemans \"P\"4 four-circle diffractometer. The crystal was aligned using 42 reflections automatically centered following measurement from a rotation photograph. The orientation matrix and unit-cell dimensions were determined from the setting angles of least-squares refinement. 3872 reflections were recorded out to 60 2θ with a fixed scan speed of 1.33° 2θ/min. Corrections for absorption by Gaussian quadrature integration were applied. Corrections for Lorentz, polarization, and background effects were also applied as well as reduction of intensities to structure factors.\n\nThe SHELXTL PC Plus system of programs were used for the calculations. The \"R\" and \"Rw\" indices are of the conventional form. The structure was solved by direct methods. The structure is centrosymmetric as indicated by the E statistics. Systematic absences also indicate the presence of a \"c\" glide for the C-centered cell. The result was placing george-ericksenite in the C2/c space group. The structure was refined by a combination of least-squares refinement and difference-Fourier synthesis to an \"R\" index of 3.5% and \"Rw\" equal to 3.5%. Site occupancies were determined by the basis of site-scattering refinement and crystal-chemical criteria.\n\nThere is one chromium (Cr) site that is symmetrically distinct and is tetrahedrally coordinated by four oxygen (O) atoms. The average length of the bonds is 1.61 Å which indicates that the Cr cation is hexavalent. The average bond length at the Cr site is less than would be expected for complete occupancy by Cr. This difference can be accounted for by partial substitution of sulfur (S) atoms.\n\nThere are three iodine (I) sites that are coordinated by three oxygen (O) atoms arranged in a triangle to one side of the cation. The distances of the bonds between the I and O atoms is 1.81 Å. This results in the IO group forming a triangular pyramid with the I site at the top of the pyramid. At each I sites there are also three additional ligands that causes the iodine atoms to have a distorted octahedral coordination. This also causes the I atom to occupy off centered positions within each octahedron. The long bonds between the atoms at the I sites contributes significant bond valence to the bonded anions.\n\nThere are three sodium (Na) sites that are each unique. Each site has a different type of coordination. The Na1 site is encompassed by two O atoms and four HO groups in a distorted octahedral arrangement with a Na1-Φ distance (where Φ=unspecified ligand) of 2.41 Å. The Na2 site is surrounded by five O atoms and 2 HO groups in an augmented octahedral arrangement with a Na2-Φ distance of 2.54 Å. The Na3 site is surrounded by five O atoms and three HO atoms in a triangular dodecahedral arrangement with a Na3-Φ distance of 2.64 Å.\n\nThere is only one magnesium (Mg) site which is coordinated by six O atoms in an octahedral arrangement with a Mg-O distance of 2.09 Å. This bond length is in accord with this site being entirely occupied by Mg with not substitution.\n\nThe one calcium (Ca) site is coordinated by six O atoms and two HO groups in a square-antiprismatic arrangement with a Ca-Φ distance of 2.50 Å. This bond length is in accord with this site being entirely occupied by Ca with not substitution.\n\nGeorge-ericksenite features a structural arrangement that is composed of slabs of polyhedra orthogonal to [100]. These slabs feature the same composition as the mineral itself and are a half of a unit thick in the [100] direction. These are connected to adjacent slabs solely by hydrogen bonding. The edges of each slab are bounded by near-planar layers of anions. The slabs themselves are composed of three planar layers of cations. There are also three planar layers of cations parallel to the edges of the slabs. This indicates that each slab consists of three layers of polyhedra. The \"c\"-glide symmetry relates the top and bottom of the slab which means the slab may be broken into two unique sheets of polyhedra.\n\nThere is a prominent zigzag pattern of chains of Na polyhedra extending in the \"c\" direction on the outer layer of the slab. The Na1 octahedron shares an edge with the Na2 augmented octahedron which shares a face with the Na3 triangular dodecahedron. This forms a linear trimer that extends in the [011] direction. This trimer is then links by edge-sharing between the Na3 and a1 polyhedra to another trimer extending in the [0-11] direction. This motif continues to form a [NaΦ] zigzag chain extending in the \"c\" direction. In each embayment of this chain the polyhedra are accented by two (IO) groups. Identical chains run parallel to the \"c\" axis that are linked only by one weak I-O bond.\n\nThe inner layer of the slab is composed of one Mg octahedron that shares corners with two Cr tetrahedra. This forms a [MTΦ] cluster. The other two anions of the Mg octahedron link by corner-sharing to two (IO) groups. These [Mg(CrO)(IO)O] clusters link together two (CaΦ) polyhedra. This forms chains parallel to the \"b\" axis. Weak I-O bonds link these chains to form the central layer of the slab.\n\nThe only other chromate-iodate mineral is dietzeite, Ca(IO)(CrO)(HO). Dietzeite and george-ericksenite have no structural relationship. Fuenzalidaite and carlosruizite are sulphate-iodate minerals found in the Chilean nitrate fields and contain small amounts of Cr substituting for S. They are also sheet structures, but the sheets are vastly different in terms of connectivity than in george-ericksenite.\n"}

The limit is , or about 8 joules. The limit is set by slowing-interactions of the protons with the microwave background radiation over long distances (~160 million light-years). The limit is at the same order of magnitude as the upper limit for energy at which cosmic rays have experimentally been detected. For example, one extreme-energy cosmic ray has been detected which appeared to possess a record (50 joules) of energy (about the same as the kinetic energy of a 35 mph baseball).\n\nThe GZK limit is derived under the assumption that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are protons. Measurements by the largest cosmic-ray observatory, the Pierre Auger Observatory, suggest that most ultra-high energy cosmic rays are heavier elements. In this case, the argument behind the GZK limit does not apply in the originally simple form and there is no fundamental contradiction in observing cosmic rays with energies that violate the limit.\n\nIn the past, the apparent violation of the GZK limit has inspired cosmologists and theoretical physicists to suggest other ways that circumvent the limit. These theories propose that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are produced nearby our galaxy or that Lorentz covariance is violated in such a way that protons do not lose energy on their way to our galaxy.\n\nThe limit was independently computed in 1966 by Kenneth Greisen, Vadim Kuzmin, and Georgiy Zatsepin, based on interactions between cosmic rays and the photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). They predicted that cosmic rays with energies over the threshold energy of would interact with cosmic microwave background photons formula_1, relatively blueshifted by the speed of the cosmic rays, to produce pions via the formula_2 resonance,\n\nor\n\nPions produced in this manner proceed to decay in the standard pion channels—ultimately to photons for neutral pions, and photons, positrons, and various neutrinos for positive pions. Neutrons decay also to similar products, so that ultimately the energy of any cosmic ray proton is drained off by production of high energy photons plus (in some cases) high energy electron/positron pairs and neutrino pairs.\n\nThe pion production process begins at a higher energy than ordinary electron-positron pair production (lepton production) from protons impacting the CMB, which starts at cosmic ray proton energies of only about . However, pion production events drain 20% of the energy of a cosmic ray proton as compared with only 0.1% of its energy for electron positron pair production. This factor of 200 is from two sources: the pion has only about ~130 times the mass of the leptons, but the extra energy appears as different kinetic energies of the pion or leptons, and results in relatively more kinetic energy transferred to a heavier product pion, in order to conserve momentum. The much larger total energy losses from pion production result in the pion production process becoming the limiting one to high energy cosmic ray travel, rather than the lower-energy light-lepton production process.\n\nThe pion production process continues until the cosmic ray energy falls below the pion production threshold. Due to the mean path associated with this interaction, extragalactic cosmic rays traveling over distances larger than () and with energies greater than this threshold should never be observed on Earth. This distance is also known as GZK horizon.\n\nA number of observations have been made by the largest cosmic ray experiments Akeno Giant Air Shower Array, High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector, the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array Project that appeared to show cosmic rays with energies above this limit (called extreme-energy cosmic rays, or EECRs). The observation of these particles was the so-called GZK paradox or cosmic ray paradox.\n\nThese observations appear to contradict the predictions of special relativity and particle physics as they are presently understood. However, there are a number of possible explanations for these observations that may resolve this inconsistency.\n\nAnother suggestion involves ultra-high energy weakly interacting particles (for instance, neutrinos) which might be created at great distances and later react locally to give rise to the particles observed. In the proposed Z-burst model, an ultra-high energy cosmic neutrino collides with a relic anti-neutrino in our galaxy and annihilates to hadrons. This process proceeds via a (virtual) Z-boson:\n\nformula_8\n\nThe cross section for this process becomes large if the center of mass energy of the neutrino antineutrino pair is equal to the Z-boson mass (such a peak in the cross section is called \"resonance\"). Assuming that the relic anti-neutrino is at rest, the energy of the incident cosmic neutrino has to be:\n\nformula_9\n\nwhere formula_10 is the mass of the Z-boson and formula_11 the mass of the neutrino.\n\nA number of exotic theories have been advanced to explain the AGASA observations, including doubly special relativity. However, it is now established that standard doubly special relativity does not predict any GZK suppression (or GZK cutoff), contrary to models of Lorentz symmetry violation involving an absolute rest frame. Other possible theories involve a relation with dark matter, decays of exotic super-heavy particles beyond those known in the Standard Model.\n\nA suppression of the cosmic ray flux which can be explained with the GZK limit has been confirmed by the latest generation of cosmic ray observatories. A former claim by the AGASA experiment that there is no suppression was overruled. It remains controversial, whether the suppression is due to the GZK effect. The GZK limit only applies if ultra-high energy cosmic rays are mostly protons.\n\nIn July 2007, during the 30th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Mérida, Yucatán, México, the High Resolution Fly's Eye Experiment (HiRes) and the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) presented their results on ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. HiRes observed a suppression in the UHECR spectrum at just the right energy, observing only 13 events with an energy above the threshold, while expecting 43 with no suppression. This was interpreted as the first observation of the GZK limit. Auger confirmed the flux suppression, but did not claim it to be the GZK limit: instead of the 30 events necessary to confirm the AGASA results, Auger saw only two, which are believed to be heavy nuclei events. The flux suppression was previously brought into question when the AGASA experiment found no suppression in their spectrum. According to Alan Watson, spokesperson for the Auger Collaboration, AGASA results have been shown to be incorrect, possibly due to the systematic shift in energy assignment.\n\nIn 2010 and the following years, both the Pierre Auger Observatory and HiRes confirmed again a flux suppression, in case of the Pierre Auger Observatory the effect is statistically significant at the level of 20 standard deviations.\n\nAfter the flux suppression was established, a heated debate ensued whether cosmic rays that violate the GZK limit are protons. The Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest observatory, found with high statistical significance that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are not purely protons, but a mixture of elements which is getting heavier with increasing energy.\nThe Telescope Array Project, a joint effort from members of the HiRes and AGASA collaborations, agrees with the former HiRes result that these cosmic rays look like protons. The claim is based on data with lower statistical significance, however. The area covered by Telescope Array is about one third of the area covered by the Pierre Auger Observatory, and the latter has been running for a longer time.\n\nThe controversy was partially resolved in 2017, when a joint working group formed by members of both experiments presented a report at the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference. According to the report, the raw experimental results are not in contradiction with each other. The different interpretations are mainly based on the use of different theoretical models (Telescope Array uses an outdated model for its interpretation), and the fact that Telescope Array has not collected enough events yet to distinguish the pure proton hypothesis from the mixed-nuclei hypothesis.\n\nEUSO, which was scheduled to fly on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2009, was designed to use the atmospheric-fluorescence technique to monitor a huge area and boost the statistics of UHECRs considerably. EUSO is to make a deep survey of UHECR-induced extensive air showers (EASs) from space, extending the measured energy spectrum well beyond the GZK-cutoff. It is to search for the origin of UHECRs, determine the nature of the origin of UHECRs, make an all-sky survey of the arrival direction of UHECRs, and seek to open the astronomical window on the extreme-energy universe with neutrinos. The fate of the EUSO Observatory is still unclear since NASA is considering early retirement of the ISS.\n\nLaunched in June 2008, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly GLAST) will also provide data that will help resolve these inconsistencies.\n\nIn November 2007, researchers at the Pierre Auger Observatory announced that they had evidence that UHECRs appear to come from the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) of energetic galaxies powered by matter swirling onto a supermassive black hole. The cosmic rays were detected and traced back to the AGNs using the Véron-Cetty-Véron catalog. These results are reported in the journal \"Science\". Nevertheless, the strength of the correlation with AGNs from this particular catalog for the Auger data recorded after 2007 has been slowly diminishing.\n\n"}

{"id": "44085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44085", "title": "John Byron", "text": "John Byron\n\nVice-Admiral The Hon. John Byron (8 November 1723 – 10 April 1786) was a British Royal Navy officer and politician. He was known as Foul-weather Jack because of his frequent encounters with bad weather at sea. As a midshipman, he sailed in the squadron under George Anson on his voyage around the world, though Byron made it only to southern Chile, where his ship was wrecked. He returned to England with the captain of HMS \"Wager\". He was governor of Newfoundland following Hugh Palliser, who left in 1768. He circumnavigated the world as a commodore with his own squadron in 1764-1766. He fought in battles in The Seven Years' War and the American Revolution. He rose to Vice Admiral of the White before his death in 1786.\n\nHis grandsons include the poet George Gordon Byron and George Anson Byron, admiral and explorer, who were the 6th and 7th Baron Byron, respectively.\n\nByron was the son of William Byron, 4th Baron Byron and Frances Berkeley, the daughter of William, 4th Baron Berkeley. He joined the Royal Navy in 1731. In 1740, he accompanied George Anson on his voyage around the world as a midshipman aboard one of the several ships in the squadron. On 14 May 1741, HMS \"Wager\" under Captain Cheap (as Captain Dandy Kidd had died), was shipwrecked on the coast of Chile on what is now called Wager Island and Byron was one of the survivors. The survivors decided to split in two teams, one to make its way by boat to Rio de Janeiro on the Atlantic coast; the other, including John Byron and the Captain, to sail north along the Spanish colonial coast.\n\nCaptain Cheap at Wager Island had a party of 19 men after the deserters rejoined the camp. This included the surgeon Elliot and Lieutenant Hamilton who had been cast adrift with him plus midshipmen John Byron and Campbell who had been in the barge. They rowed up the coast but were punished by continuous rain, headwinds and waves that threatened the boats. One night while the men slept on shore, one of the boats was capsized while at anchor and was swept out to sea with its two boatkeepers. One of the men got ashore but the other drowned. As it was now impossible for them all to fit in the remaining boat, four marines were left ashore with muskets to fend for themselves. The winds prevented them from getting around the headland so they returned to pick up the marines only to find them gone. They returned to Wager Island in early February 1742. With one death on the journey, there were now 13 in the group.\n\nA local Indian guided the men up the coast to Chiloe Island so they set out again. Two men died and after burying the bodies, the six seaman rowed off in the boat never to be seen again while Cheap, Hamilton, Byron, Campbell and the dying Elliot were on shore looking for food. The Indian then agreed to take the remaining four on by canoe for their only remaining possession, a musket. Eventually they made it to be taken prisoner by the Spanish. The Spaniards treated them well and they were eventually taken to the inland capital of Santiago where they were released on parole. The Spaniards heard that Anson had been generous in the treatment of the prisoners he had taken and this kindness was returned.\n\nByron and the other three men stayed in Santiago till late 1744 and were offered passage on a French ship bound for Spain. Three accepted the passage. Campbell elected to take a mule across the Andes and joined the Spanish Admiral Pizarro in Montevideo on the \"Asia\" only to find Isaac Morris and the two seamen who had been abandoned in Freshwater Bay on the Atlantic coast. After time in prison in Spain, Campbell reached Britain in May 1746, followed by the other three two months later.\n\nIn England, the official court martial examined only the loss of the \"Wager\" in which Baynes, in nominal charge at the time, was acquitted of blame but reprimanded for omissions of duty. Disputes over what happened after the wreck were instead played out as Bulkeley and Cummins, Campbell, Morris, the cooper Young and later Byron published their own accounts, the last of which was the only one that in any way defended Cheap who had since died. Twenty nine crew members plus seven marines made it back to England.\n\nByron's account of his adventures and the Wager Mutiny are recounted in \"The Narrative of the Honourable John Byron\" (1768). His book sold well enough to be printed in several editions.\n\nByron was appointed captain of in December 1746.\n\nIn 1760 during the Seven Years' War, Byron commanded a squadron sent to destroy the fortifications at Louisbourg, Quebec, which had been captured by the British two years before. They wanted to ensure it could not be used by the French in Canada. In July of that year he defeated the French flotilla sent to relieve New France at the Battle of Restigouche.\n\nIn early 1764 the British Admiralty determined that it would require a permanent naval settlement off the South American coast, in order to resupply naval vessels seeking to enter the Pacific via Cape Horn. Captain Byron was selected to explore the South Atlantic for a suitable island upon which to establish such a settlement. The South American mainland was controlled by Spain, which was hostile to local expansion of British interests; to disguise Byron's mission it was announced that he had been appointed the new commander of the Navy's East Indies Station. Byron set sail in June 1764, ostensibly to take up the East Indies post. For the voyage he was granted command of the 24-gun frigate and the 16-gun sloop .\nByron's two-vessel flotilla crossed the Atlantic over the winter of 1764 and made its way slowly down the South American coast. The Admiralty had ordered Byron to first seek Pepys Island, reputedly discovered off the Patagonian coast by the corsair Ambrose Cowley in 1683. Byron reached the co-ordinates given by Cowley in January 1765, but there was no sign of the island and the search was swiftly abandoned. On 5 February Byron reached the Patagonian settlement of Port Desire where he resupplied his vessels from the storeship .\n\nBetween June 1764 and May 1766, Byron completed his own circumnavigation of the globe as captain of HMS \"Dolphin\". This was the first such circumnavigation that was accomplished in less than 2 years. His actions nearly caused a war between Great Britain and Spain, as both countries had armed fleets ready to contest the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. Later Byron encountered islands and extant residents of the Tuamotus and Tokelau Islands, and Nikunau in the southern Gilbert Islands; he also visited Tinian in the Northern Marianas Islands. A notable member of Byron's crew was Master's Mate Erasmus Gower whom Byron chose to 'take a significant part' in the ceremony when he took possession of the Falkland Islands. Byron had examined Gower for his lieutenant's examination in 1762 and was so impressed that he chose him to accompany him on his own circumnavigation (1764-65) and ensured that he was appointed as lieutenant to Commander Philip Carteret immediately afterwards in the next circumnavigation (1766-69). \n\nIn 1769 he was appointed governor of Newfoundland off the mainland of Canada, an office he held for the next three years.\n\nHe was promoted to rear admiral on 31 March 1775. In 1779, he served as Commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands Station during the American War of Independence. He unsuccessfully attacked a French fleet under the Comte d'Estaing at the Battle of Grenada in July 1779. Byron was briefly Commander-in-Chief, North American Station from 1 October 1779. He was made vice admiral of the white in September 1780.\n\nOn 8 September 1748 he married his first cousin Sophia Trevanion, daughter of John Trevanion of Caerhays in Cornwall and Barbara Berkeley, the sister of his mother. They had two sons and seven daughters, three of whom died in infancy (a daughter Juliana Bryon married her cousin Hon. William Byron, died 1776, son of William Byron, 5th Baron Byron). Their eldest son, John \"Mad Jack\" Byron, in turn fathered the poet George Gordon Byron, the future 6th Baron Byron. John Byron was also the grandfather of George Anson Byron, another admiral and explorer and later the 7th Baron Byron. He was the brother of Hon. George Byron, married to Frances Levett, daughter of Elton Levett of Nottingham, a descendant of Ambrose Elton, Esq., High Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1618 and a surgeon in Nottingham.\n\nJohn Byron died on 10 April 1786 at home in London. His remains were buried in the Berkeley family vault situated beneath the chancel of the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Twickenham.\n\nJohn Byron's experiences in the Anson voyage form the basis of the novel \"The Unknown Shore\" by Patrick O'Brian. It closely follows Byron's account in \"The Narrative of the Honourable John Byron\" (1768).\n\n\n\n \n"}

It has usually been described as appearing as a horse, but is able to adopt human form. Some accounts state that the kelpie retains its hooves when appearing as a human, leading to its association with the Christian idea of Satan as alluded to by Robert Burns in his 1786 poem \"Address to the Devil\".\n\nAlmost every sizeable body of water in Scotland has an associated kelpie story, but the most extensively reported is that of Loch Ness. Parallels to the general Germanic neck or nixie and the Scandinavian bäckahäst have been observed. More widely, the wihwin of Central America and the Australian bunyip have been seen as counterparts. The origin of the belief in malevolent water horses has been proposed as originating in human sacrifices once made to appease gods associated with water, but narratives about the kelpie also served a practical purpose in keeping children away from dangerous stretches of water, and warning young women to be wary of handsome strangers.\n\nKelpies have been portrayed in their various forms in art and literature, including recently as two high steel sculptures in Falkirk, \"The Kelpies\", completed in October 2013.\n\nThe etymology of the Scots word \"kelpie\" is uncertain, but it may be derived from the Gaelic \"calpa\" or \"cailpeach\", meaning \"heifer\" or \"colt\". The first recorded use of the term to describe a mythological creature, then spelled \"kaelpie\", appears in the manuscript of an ode by William Collins, composed some time before 1759 and reproduced in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh of 1788. The place names Kelpie hoall and Kelpie hooll are reported in \"A Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue\" as appearing in the 1674 burgh records for Kirkcudbright.\n\nDouglas Harper, historian and founder of the Online Etymology Dictionary, defines \"kelpie\" as \"the Lowland name of a demon in the shape of a horse\". It is the most common water spirit in Scottish folklore, but the name is attributed to several different forms in narratives recorded throughout the country. The late 19th century saw the onset of an interest in transcribing folklore, but the recorders were inconsistent in spelling and frequently anglicised words, which could result in differing names for the same spirit.\n\nCommentators have disagreed over the kelpie's aquatic habitat. Folklorists who define kelpies as spirits living beside rivers, as distinguished from the Celtic lakeside-dwelling water horse (\"each-uisge\"), include 19th-century minister of Tiree John Gregorson Campbell and 20th-century writers Lewis Spence and Katharine Briggs. This distinction is not universally applied however; Sir Walter Scott for instance claims that the kelpie's range may extend to lochs. Mackillop's dictionary reconciles the discrepancy, stating that the kelpie was \"initially thought to inhabit ... streams, and later any body of water.\" But the distinction should stand, argues one annotator, who suggests that people are led astray when an \"each uisge\" in a \"common practice of translating\" are referred to as kelpies in English accounts, and thus mistakenly attribute lake-dwelling habits to the latter.\n\nOthers associate the term \"kelpie\" with a wide variety of mythical creatures. Counterparts in some regions of Scotland include the shoopiltee and nuggle of Shetland and the tangie of Orkney; in other parts of the United Kingdom they include the Welsh ceffyl dŵr and the Manx cabbyl-ushtey. Parallels to the general Germanic neck and the Scandinavian bäckahäst have been observed; Nick Middleton observes that \"the kelpie of Scottish folklore is a direct parallel of the [sic] bäckahästen [of Scandinavian folklore]\". The wihwin of Central America and the Australian bunyip are seen as similar creatures in other parts of the world.\n\nThe mythological kelpie is usually described as a powerful and beautiful black horse inhabiting the deep pools of rivers and streams of Scotland, preying on any humans it encounters, One of the water-kelpie's common identifying characteristics is that its hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse, a trait also shared by the \"nykur\" of Iceland. An Aberdeenshire variation portrays the kelpie as a horse with a mane of serpents, whereas the resident equine spirit of the River Spey was white and could entice victims onto its back by singing.\n\nThe creature's nature was described by Walter Gregor, a folklorist and one of the first members of the Folklore Society, as \"useful\", \"hurtful\", or seeking \"human companionship\"; in some cases, kelpies take their victims into the water, devour them, and throw the entrails to the water's edge. In its equine form the kelpie is able to extend the length of its back to carry many riders together into the depths; a common theme in the tales is of several children clambering onto the creature's back while one remains on the shore. Usually a little boy, he then pets the horse but his hand sticks to its neck. In some variations the lad cuts off his fingers or hand to free himself; he survives but the other children are carried off and drowned, with only some of their entrails being found later. Such a creature said to inhabit Glen Keltney in Perthshire is considered to be a kelpie by 20th-century folklorist Katharine Mary Briggs, but a similar tale also set in Perthshire has an \"each uisge\" as the culprit and omits the embellishment of the young boy. The lad does cut his finger off when the event takes place in Thurso, where a water kelpie is identified as the culprit. The same tale set at Sunart in the Highlands gives a specific figure of nine children lost, of whom only the innards of one are recovered. The surviving boy is again saved by cutting off his finger, and the additional information is given that he had a Bible in his pocket. Gregorson Campbell considers the creature responsible to have been a water horse rather than a kelpie, and the tale \"obviously a pious fraud to keep children from wandering on Sundays\".\n\nKelpie myths usually describe a solitary creature, but a fairy story recorded by John F. Campbell in \"Popular Tales of the West Highlands\" (1860) has a different perspective. Entitled \"Of the Drocht na Vougha or Fuoah\", which is given the translation of \"the bridge of the fairies or kelpies\", it features a group of voughas. The spirits had set about constructing a bridge over the Dornoch Firth after becoming tired of travelling across the water in cockleshells. It was a magnificent piece of work resplendent with gold piers and posts, but sank into the water to become a treacherous area of quicksand after a grateful onlooker tried to bless the kelpies for their work. The same story is recorded by Folklore Society member and folklore collector Charlotte Dempster simply as \"The Kelpie's Bridge\" (1888) with no mention of Voughas or Fuoah. Quoting the same narrative Jennifer Westwood, author and folklorist, uses the descriptor \"water kelpies\", adding that in her opinion \"Kelpies, here and in a few other instances, is used in a loose sense to mean something like 'imps.\n\nProgeny resulting from a mating between a kelpie and a normal horse were impossible to drown, and could be recognised by their shorter than normal ears, a characteristic shared by the mythical water bull or \"tarbh uisge\" in Scottish Gaelic, similar to the Manx \"tarroo ushtey\".\n\nKelpies have the ability to transform themselves into non-equine forms, and can take on the outward appearance of human figures, in which guise they may betray themselves by the presence of water weeds in their hair. In their human form, kelpies are almost invariably male. One of the few stories describing the creature in female form is set at Conon House in Ross and Cromarty. It tells of a \"tall woman dressed in green\", with a \"withered, meagre countenance, ever distorted by a malignant scowl\", who overpowered and drowned a man and a boy after she jumped out of a stream. Gregor described a kelpie adopting the guise of a wizened old man continually muttering to himself while sitting on a bridge stitching a pair of trousers. Believing it to be a kelpie, a passing local struck it on the head, causing it to revert to its equine form and scamper back to its lair in a nearby pond. Other accounts describe the kelpie when appearing in human form as a \"rough, shaggy man who leaps behind a solitary rider, gripping and crushing him\", or as tearing apart and devouring humans.\n\nA folk tale from Barra tells of a lonely kelpie that transforms itself into a handsome young man to woo a pretty young girl it was determined to take for its wife. But the girl recognises the young man as a kelpie and removes his silver necklace (his bridle) while he sleeps. The kelpie immediately reverts to its equine form, and the girl takes it home to her father's farm, where it is put to work for a year. At the end of that time the girl rides the kelpie to consult a wise man, who tells her to return the silver necklace. The wise man then asks the kelpie, once again transformed into the handsome young man the girl had first met, whether if given the choice it would choose to be a kelpie or a mortal. The kelpie in turn asks the girl whether, if he were a man, she would agree to be his wife. She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become a mortal man, and the pair are married.\n\nThe arrival of Christianity in Scotland in the 6th century resulted in some folk stories and beliefs being recorded by scribes, usually Christian monks, instead of being perpetuated by word of mouth. Some accounts state that the kelpie retains its hooves even in human form, leading to its association with the Christian notion of Satan, just as with the Greek god Pan. Robert Burns refers to such a Satanic association in his \"Address to the Devil\" (1786):\nWhen a kelpie appeared in its equine persona without any tack, it could be captured using a halter stamped with the sign of a cross, and its strength could then be harnessed in tasks such as the transportation of heavy mill stones. One folk tale describes how the Laird of Morphie captured a kelpie and used it to carry stones to build his castle. Once the work was complete, the laird released the kelpie, which was evidently unhappy about its treatment. The curse it issued before leaving – \"Sair back and sair banes/ Drivin' the Laird o' Morphies's stanes,/ The Laird o' Morphie'll never thrive/ As lang's the kelpy is alive\" – was popularly believed to have resulted in the extinction of the laird's family. Some kelpies were said to be equipped with a bridle and sometimes a saddle, and appeared invitingly ready to ride, but if mounted they would run off and drown their riders. If the kelpie was already wearing a bridle, exorcism might be achieved by removing it. A bridle taken from a kelpie was endowed with magical properties, and if brandished towards someone, was able to transform that person into a horse or pony.\n\nJust as with cinematic werewolves, a kelpie can be killed by being shot with a silver bullet, after which it is seen to consist of nothing more than \"turf and a soft mass like jelly-fish\" according to an account published by Spence. When a blacksmith's family were being frightened by the repeated appearances of a water kelpie at their summer cottage, the blacksmith managed to render it into a \"heap of starch, or something like it\" by penetrating the spirit's flanks with two sharp iron spears that had been heated in a fire.\n\nAlmost every sizeable Scottish body of water has a kelpie story associated with it, but the most widely reported is the kelpie of Loch Ness. Several stories of mythical spirits and monsters are attached to the loch dating back to 6th-century reports of Saint Columba defeating a monster there. The early 19th-century kelpie that haunted the woods and shores of Loch Ness was tacked up with its own saddle and bridle. A fable attached to the notoriously nasty creature has the Highlander James MacGrigor taking it by surprise and cutting off its bridle, the source of its power and life, without which it would die within twenty-four hours. As the kelpie had the power of speech, it attempted unsuccessfully to bargain with MacGrigor for the return of its bridle. After following MacGrigor to his home, the kelpie asserted that MacGrigor would be unable to enter his house while in possession of the bridle, because of the presence of a cross above the entrance door. But MacGrigor outwitted the creature by tossing the bridle through a window, so the kelpie accepted its fate and left, cursing and swearing. The myth is perpetuated with further tales of the bridle as it is passed down through the family. Referred to as \"Willox's Ball and Bridle\", it had magical powers of healing; a spell was made by placing the items in water while chanting \"In the name of the Father, the Son and of the Holy Ghost\"; the water could then be used as a cure.\n\nA popular and more recent explanation for the Loch Ness monster among believers is that it belongs to a line of long-surviving plesiosaurs, but the kelpie myth still survives in children's books such as Mollie Hunter's \"The Kelpie's Pearls\" (1966) and Dick King-Smith's \"The Water Horse\" (1990).\n\nFolklorist Gary R. Varner has suggested that the origin of the belief in water horses that preyed on and devoured humans may be a reflection of the human sacrifices once made to appease the gods of water. The association with horses may have its roots in horse sacrifices performed in ancient Scandinavia. Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping children away from perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent women to be wary of attractive young strangers. The stories were also used to enforce moral standards, as they implied that the creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays. The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or turbulent water.\n\nHistorian and symbologist Charles Milton Smith has hypothesised that the kelpie myth might originate with the water spouts that can form over the surface of Scottish lochs, giving the impression of a living form as they move across the water. Sir Walter Scott alludes to a similar explanation in his epic poem \"The Lady of the Lake\" (1810), which contains the lines\n\nPictish stones dating from the 6th to 9th centuries featuring what has been dubbed the Pictish Beast may be the earliest representations of a kelpie or kelpie-like creature. Other depictions show kelpies as poolside maidens, as in Draper's 1913 oil on canvas. Thomas Millie Dow had also sketched the kelpie in 1895 as a melancholy dark-haired maiden balanced on a rock, a common depiction for artists of the period. Folklorist Nicola Bown has suggested that painters such as Millie Dow and Draper deliberately ignored earlier accounts of the kelpie and reinvented it by altering its sex and nature.\n\nTwo high steel sculptures in Falkirk on the Forth and Clyde Canal, named \"The Kelpies\", borrow the name of the mythical creature to associate with the strength and endurance of the horse; designed by sculptor Andy Scott, they were built as monuments to Scotland's horse-powered industrial heritage. Construction was completed in October 2013 and the sculptures were opened for public access from April 2014.\n\n\n"}

The list is continued down to 2500 m elevation on this page and down to 2000 m elevation on this page. All of these mountains are located in France, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany or Slovenia. The list includes all 44 ultra-prominent peaks of the Alps, with 19 ultras over 3000m on this page.\n\nThe Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme defines a summit in the Alps as independent, if the connecting ridge between it and a higher summit drops at least 30 m (a prominence/drop of 30 m, with the lowest point referred to as the \"key col\"). There are over 3300 such summits exceeding 2500 m in Switzerland alone. In order for a peak to qualify as an independent mountain, traditionally a prominence of at least 300 m, or 10 times the aforementioned criterion value, has been used. Inclusion based on prominence is expedient for its objectivity and verifiability, but has its drawbacks. For example, an impressive mountain peak dominating a valley may be connected via long high ridges to a barely higher hidden summit. Among the better-known peaks absent from this list are Aiguille du Dru (due to Aiguille Verte), Dent du Géant (Grandes Jorasses), Mont Blanc de Cheilon (Ruinette), Nadelhorn and Täschhorn (Dom), Piz d'Err (Piz Calderas), Piz Badile (Piz Cengalo), Piz Palü (Piz Zupo), Similaun (Hintere Schwarze), Crozzon di Brenta (Cima Tosa), and Cimon della Pala (Cima Vezzana).\n\nAll mountain heights and prominences on the list are from the largest-scale maps available.\nHowever, heights often conflict on different topographic maps, even when created by the same cartographic institution. For example, the Fletschhorn is indicated to be 3993, 3982, and 3984.5 m high on the 1:100,000, 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 Swisstopo map, respectively. The (rounded) elevation of the latter map is used in this table.\nAlso, the deepest points in connecting ridges are not always survey points with spot elevations, where heights have to be estimated from contour lines. For example, maps often provide heights for the place where a route passes over a ridge rather than for the lowest point of that pass.\n\nFinally, many height indications on these maps are from quite old measurements, while glacier and firn melt has decreased the height of both peaks and key cols, sometimes quite dramatically. For example, in 1930, glacier-capped Cima Tosa was the highest mountain of the Brenta Dolomites at 3,173 m, but now is around 3,140 m high and some 10 m lower than its rocky neighbor Cima Brenta (3,151 m). Most maps and guides still report Cima Tosa's old height. On the other hand, in the 1930s, when the current Italian 1:25.000 topographic map of the region was created, the \"Passo del Vannino\", northwest of the Ofenhorn, was covered by the \"Lebendun\" glacier and was measured to be 2,754 m, while the much more recent Swisstopo map shows it to be bare and 2,717 m high. This is the key col for Corno di Ban (3,028 m), which, thanks to the retreat of the glacier, now appears on the list with a prominence of 311 m.\n\nGiven the inaccuracies, the list includes (unranked) summits with estimated prominences down to 7 meter below the cut-off (293 m), many of which may very well have a real prominence exceeding 300 m.\n\nThe lists contain 1599 mountains higher than 2000 m. The summits are distributed over 7 countries as follows:\n\n175 of the summits are on international borders. A number of mountains (e.g. Rocciamelone (IT), Aiguille de Tré la Tête (IT), Monte Rosa (CH), Piz Bernina (CH), and Hochgall (IT)) straddle borders as well, but have their summit on one side. In the list, only the exact location of the culminating point of the mountain is considered.\n\nThe 1092 mountains over 2500 m are found in 44 different administrative regions (cantons, departments, provinces, states). The administrative regions with the most mountains over 2500 m are Tyrol (161), Graubünden (148), Valais (103), South Tyrol (91), Sondrio (73), Aosta Valley (69), Savoy (67), Hautes-Alpes (66), Salzburg (57), Belluno (56) and Trentino (50).\n\nThe table below shows the distribution of mountains by height and prominence. Totals do not include the 54 unranked summits with 293-299 m prominence. Cima Brenta is treated as having a prominence of 1500m for consistency with lists of ultras.\n\nThe table is continued here.\n\n\n"}

They are characterised by a distinct red colour, and a light curve that lingers with resurgent brightness in the infrared. Luminous red novae are not to be confused with standard novae, explosions that occur on the surface of white dwarf stars.\n\nA small number of objects exhibiting the characteristics of luminous red novae have been observed over the last 30 years or so. The red star M31 RV in the Andromeda Galaxy flared brightly during 1988 and may have been a luminous red nova. In 1994, V4332 Sgr, a star in the Milky Way galaxy, flared similarly, and in 2002, V838 Mon followed suit and was studied quite closely.\n\nThe first confirmed luminous red nova was the object M85 OT2006-1, in the galaxy Messier 85. It was first observed during the Lick Observatory Supernova Search, and subsequently investigated by a team of astronomers from both U.C. Berkeley and Caltech. They confirmed its difference from known explosions such as novae and thermal pulses, and announced luminous red novae as a new class of stellar explosion.\n\nV1309 Scorpii is a luminous red nova that followed the merger of a contact binary in 2008.\n\nIn January 2015, a luminous red nova was observed in the Andromeda Galaxy.\n\nOn February 10, 2015, a luminous red nova, known as M101 OT2015-1 was discovered in the Pinwheel Galaxy.\n\nThe luminosity of the explosion occurring in luminous red novae is between that of a supernova (which is brighter) and a nova (dimmer). The visible light lasts for weeks or months, and is distinctively red in colour, becoming dimmer and redder over time. As the visible light dims, the infrared light grows and also lasts for an extended period of time, usually dimming and brightening a number of times.\n\nInfrared observations of M85 OT2006-1 have shown that temperature of this star is slightly less than 1000 K, a rather low temperature. It is not clear if this characteristic is shared by other luminous red novae.\n\nThe team investigating M85 OT2006-1 believe it to have formed when two main sequence stars merged. (See the article on V838 Mon for further information on \"mergebursts\" and alternative possibilities.)\n\nAt the time the mergeburst occurs, the LRN appears to expand extremely rapidly, reaching thousands to tens of thousands of solar radii in only a few months. This would cause the object to cool, explaining the intriguing co-existence of a bright flash with a cool post-flash object.\n\nSome astronomers believe it to be premature to declare a new class of stellar explosions based on such a limited number of observations.\nFor instance, they may be due to a type II-p supernova; alternatively, supernovae undergoing a high level of extinction will naturally be both red and of low luminosity.\n\nIn early-2022 (2022.2 ± 0.6), KIC 9832227, a binary star system, was predicted to merge and produce a red nova. In September 2018, a typo was discovered in data used for the initial prediction, and it was determined that the merger would likely not take place at the predicted time.\n\n\n"}

To the northwest of the mare is the Montes Riphaeus mountain range, part of the rim of the buried crater or basin containing the mare. Previously unnamed, the mare received its name in 1964 in reference to its selection as the target for the successful impact probe Ranger 7, the first American spacecraft to return closeup images of the Moon's surface.\n\nThe basin material is of the Lower Imbrian epoch, while most of the basaltic mare material is of the Upper Imbrian epoch.\n\nThe Ranger 7 lunar probe impacted Mare Cognitum at the conclusion of its picture-taking mission. Surveyor 3 and Apollo 12 landed near its northern shore. The outcrop of the Fra Mauro formation, where Apollo 14 landed, is also located near Mare Cognitum.\n\nThe landing site of Apollo 12 within Mare Cognitum, near the Surveyor 3 landing site, is known as \"Statio Cognitum.\" This site was selected in an effort to demonstrate the capability for precision lunar landings to explore specific sites in future Apollo missions, so mission planners used Surveyor 3 as a landing target. This specific site was selected because of its relative smoothness (given its location on the mare surface) and proximity to the lunar equator (ensuring relative ease of access from the standpoint of fuel consumption). \n\nGeologically, the astronauts noted the amount of glass contained in the regolith and present at the bottoms of shallow craters at the site, as well as lighter-colored regolith material that geologists later determined to be ejecta from Copernicus crater. The Copernicus ejecta sampled suggested that the Copernicus impact occurred about 800 million years ago, but geologists believe the results of this analysis are inconclusive. The Apollo 12 astronauts also noted the existence of small, shallow elongated depressions (\"trenches\" or \"grooves\") similar to those the Apollo 11 astronauts observed at Tranquility Base in the Sea of Tranquility; Shoemaker et al. preliminarily concluded in 1970 that these features reflected the direction and location of fractures in the underlying bedrock, into which fine-grained material settled, thereby creating the grooves. \n\nOverall, Statio Cognitum and the surrounding area appears to have a slightly more red coloration from lunar orbit than Tranquility Base (which geologists later found to be the result of less titanium in the Apollo 12 rocks) and to have less craters overall than Tranquility Base; because of this, geologists suspected the site chosen for Apollo 12 contained younger rocks than those of the Apollo 11 site, and this was confirmed by the samples returned by Apollo 12. These samples consisted of more basalts and fewer breccias than the Apollo 11 samples and the basalts are about 500 million years younger than those from Tranquility base, the latter of which geologists estimate to be about 3.6 to 3.8 billion years old. The differing ages of the basalts collected on Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 demonstrate that the volcanic activity that formed the lunar mare did not occur all at once across the lunar surface, but rather took place at different times at different locations.\n"}
{"id": "2127046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127046", "title": "Marine pollution", "text": "Marine pollution\n\nMarine pollution occurs when harmful effects result from the entry into the ocean of chemicals, particles, industrial, agricultural, and residential waste, noise, or the spread of invasive organisms. Eighty percent of marine pollution comes from land. Air pollution is also a contributing factor by carrying off pesticides or dirt into the ocean. Land and air pollution have proven to be harmful to marine life and its habitats.\n\nThe pollution often comes from nonpoint sources such as agricultural runoff, wind-blown debris, and dust. Nutrient pollution, a form of water pollution, refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients. It is a primary cause of eutrophication of surface waters, in which excess nutrients, usually nitrates or phosphates, stimulate algae growth. Many potentially toxic chemicals adhere to tiny particles which are then taken up by plankton and benthic animals, most of which are either deposit feeders or filter feeders. In this way, the toxins are concentrated upward within ocean food chains. Many particles combine chemically in a manner highly depletive of oxygen, causing estuaries to become anoxic.\n\nWhen pesticides are incorporated into the marine ecosystem, they quickly become absorbed into marine food webs. Once in the food webs, these pesticides can cause mutations, as well as diseases, which can be harmful to humans as well as the entire food web. Toxic metals can also be introduced into marine food webs. These can cause a change to tissue matter, biochemistry, behaviour, reproduction, and suppress growth in marine life. Also, many animal feeds have a high fish meal or fish hydrolysate content. In this way, marine toxins can be transferred to land animals, and appear later in meat and dairy products.\n\nIn order to protect the ocean from marine pollution, policies have been developed internationally. There are different ways for the ocean to get polluted, therefore there have been multiple laws, policies, and treaties put into place throughout history.\n\nAlthough marine pollution has a long history, significant international laws to counter it were only enacted in the twentieth century. Marine pollution was a concern during several United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea beginning in the 1950s. Most scientists believed that the oceans were so vast that they had unlimited ability to dilute, and thus render pollution harmless.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, there were several controversies about dumping radioactive waste off the coasts of the United States by companies licensed by the Atomic Energy Commission, into the Irish Sea from the British reprocessing facility at Windscale, and into the Mediterranean Sea by the French Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique. After the Mediterranean Sea controversy, for example, Jacques Cousteau became a worldwide figure in the campaign to stop marine pollution. Marine pollution made further international headlines after the 1967 crash of the oil tanker Torrey Canyon, and after the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill off the coast of California.\n\nMarine pollution was a major area of discussion during the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm. That year also saw the signing of the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, sometimes called the London Convention. The London Convention did not ban marine pollution, but it established black and gray lists for substances to be banned (black) or regulated by national authorities (gray). Cyanide and high-level radioactive waste, for example, were put on the black list. The London Convention applied only to waste dumped from ships, and thus did nothing to regulate waste discharged as liquids from pipelines.\n\nThere are many ways to categorize and examine the inputs of pollution into our marine ecosystems. Patin (n.d.) notes that generally there are three main types of inputs of pollution into the ocean: direct discharge of waste into the oceans, runoff into the waters due to rain, and pollutants released from the atmosphere.\n\nOne common path of entry by contaminants to the sea are rivers. The evaporation of water from oceans exceeds precipitation. The balance is restored by rain over the continents entering rivers and then being returned to the sea. The Hudson in New York State and the Raritan in New Jersey, which empty at the northern and southern ends of Staten Island, are a source of mercury contamination of zooplankton (copepods) in the open ocean. The highest concentration in the filter-feeding copepods is not at the mouths of these rivers but south, nearer Atlantic City, because water flows close to the coast. It takes a few days before toxins are taken up by the plankton.\n\nPollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution. Point source pollution occurs when there is a single, identifiable, localized source of the pollution. An example is directly discharging sewage and industrial waste into the ocean. Pollution such as this occurs particularly in developing nations. Nonpoint source pollution occurs when the pollution comes from ill-defined and diffuse sources. These can be difficult to regulate. Agricultural runoff and wind blown debris are prime examples.\n\nPollutants enter rivers and the sea directly from urban sewerage and industrial waste discharges, sometimes in the form of hazardous and toxic wastes.\n\nInland mining for copper, gold, etc., is another source of marine pollution. Most of the pollution is simply soil, which ends up in rivers flowing to the sea. However, some minerals discharged in the course of the mining can cause problems, such as copper, a common industrial pollutant, which can interfere with the life history and development of coral polyps. Mining has a poor environmental track record. For example, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, mining has contaminated portions of the headwaters of over 40% of watersheds in the western continental US. Much of this pollution finishes up in the sea.\n\nSurface runoff from farming, as well as urban runoff and runoff from the construction of roads, buildings, ports, channels, and harbours, can carry soil and particles laden with carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and minerals. This nutrient-rich water can cause fleshy algae and phytoplankton to thrive in coastal areas; known as algal blooms, which have the potential to create hypoxic conditions by using all available oxygen. In the coast of southwest Florida, harmful algal blooms have existed for over 100 years. These algal blooms have been a cause of species of fish, turtles, dolphins, and shrimp to die and cause harmful effects on humans who swim in the water.\n\nPolluted runoff from roads and highways can be a significant source of water pollution in coastal areas. About 75% of the toxic chemicals that flow into Puget Sound are carried by stormwater that runs off paved roads and driveways, rooftops, yards and other developed land. In California, there are many rainstorms that runoff into the ocean. These rainstorms occur from October to March, and these runoff waters contain petroleum, heavy metals, pollutants from emissions, etc.\n\nIn China, there is a large coastal population that pollutes the ocean through land runoff. This includes sewage discharge and pollution from urbanization and land use. In 2001, more than 66,795 mi² of the Chinese coastal ocean waters were rated less than Class I of the Sea Water Quality Standard of China. Much of this pollution came from Ag, Cu, Cd, Pb, As, DDT, PCBs, etc., which occurred from contamination through land runoff.\n\nShips can pollute waterways and oceans in many ways. Oil spills can have devastating effects. While being toxic to marine life, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), found in crude oil, are very difficult to clean up, and last for years in the sediment and marine environment.\n\nOil spills are probably the most emotive of marine pollution events. However, while a tanker wreck may result in extensive newspaper headlines, much of the oil in the world's seas comes from other smaller sources, such as tankers discharging ballast water from oil tanks used on return ships, leaking pipelines or engine oil disposed of down sewers.\n\nDischarge of cargo residues from bulk carriers can pollute ports, waterways, and oceans. In many instances vessels intentionally discharge illegal wastes despite foreign and domestic regulation prohibiting such actions. An absence of national standards provides an incentive for some cruise liners to dump waste in places where the penalties are inadequate. It has been estimated that container ships lose over 10,000 containers at sea each year (usually during storms). Ships also create noise pollution that disturbs natural wildlife, and water from ballast tanks can spread harmful algae and other invasive species.\n\nBallast water taken up at sea and released in port is a major source of unwanted exotic marine life. The invasive freshwater zebra mussels, native to the Black, Caspian, and Azov seas, were probably transported to the Great Lakes via ballast water from a transoceanic vessel. Meinesz believes that one of the worst cases of a single invasive species causing harm to an ecosystem can be attributed to a seemingly harmless jellyfish. \"Mnemiopsis leidyi\", a species of comb jellyfish that spread so it now inhabits estuaries in many parts of the world. It was first introduced in 1982, and thought to have been transported to the Black Sea in a ship's ballast water. The population of the jellyfish grew exponentially and, by 1988, it was wreaking havoc upon the local fishing industry. \"The anchovy catch fell from 204,000 tons in 1984 to 200 tons in 1993; sprat from 24,600 tons in 1984 to 12,000 tons in 1993; horse mackerel from 4,000 tons in 1984 to zero in 1993.\" Now that the jellyfish have exhausted the zooplankton, including fish larvae, their numbers have fallen dramatically, yet they continue to maintain a stranglehold on the ecosystem.\n\nInvasive species can take over once occupied areas, facilitate the spread of new diseases, introduce new genetic material, alter underwater seascapes, and jeopardize the ability of native species to obtain food. Invasive species are responsible for about $138 billion annually in lost revenue and management costs in the US alone.\n\nAnother pathway of pollution occurs through the atmosphere. Wind-blown dust and debris, including plastic bags, are blown seaward from landfills and other areas. Dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the subtropical ridge moves into the Caribbean and Florida during the warm season as the ridge builds and moves northward through the subtropical Atlantic. Dust can also be attributed to a global transport from the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts across Korea, Japan, and the Northern Pacific to the Hawaiian Islands. \n\nSince 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened due to periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year; however, the flux is greater during positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation. The USGS links dust events to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s.\n\nClimate change is raising ocean temperatures and raising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These rising levels of carbon dioxide are acidifying the oceans. This, in turn, is altering aquatic ecosystems and modifying fish distributions, with impacts on the sustainability of fisheries and the livelihoods of the communities that depend on them. Healthy ocean ecosystems are also important for the mitigation of climate change.\n\nDeep sea mining is a relatively new mineral retrieval process that takes place on the ocean floor. Ocean mining sites are usually around large areas of polymetallic nodules or active and extinct hydrothermal vents at about 1,400 – 3,700 meters below the ocean's surface. The vents create sulfide deposits, which contain precious metals such as silver, gold, copper, manganese, cobalt, and zinc. The deposits are mined using either hydraulic pumps or bucket systems that take ore to the surface to be processed. As with all mining operations, deep sea mining raises questions about environmental damages to the surrounding areas\n\nBecause deep sea mining is a relatively new field, the complete consequences of full-scale mining operations are unknown. However, experts are certain that removal of parts of the sea floor will result in disturbances to the benthic layer, increased toxicity of the water column, and sediment plumes from tailings. Removing parts of the sea floor disturbs the habitat of benthic organisms, possibly, depending on the type of mining and location, causing permanent disturbances. Aside from direct impact of mining the area, leakage, spills, and corrosion would alter the mining area's chemical makeup.\n\nAmong the impacts of deep sea mining, sediment plumes could have the greatest impact. Plumes are caused when the tailings from mining (usually fine particles) are dumped back into the ocean, creating a cloud of particles floating in the water. Two types of plumes occur: near-bottom plumes and surface plumes. Near-bottom plumes occur when the tailings are pumped back down to the mining site. The floating particles increase the turbidity, or cloudiness, of the water, clogging filter-feeding apparatuses used by benthic organisms. Surface plumes cause a more serious problem. Depending on the size of the particles and water currents the plumes could spread over vast areas. The plumes could impact zooplankton and light penetration, in turn affecting the food web of the area.\n\nThe oceans are normally a natural carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Because the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are increasing, the oceans are becoming more acidic.\nThe potential consequences of ocean acidification are not fully understood, but there are concerns that structures made of calcium carbonate may become vulnerable to dissolution, affecting corals and the ability of shellfish to form shells.\n\nOceans and coastal ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon cycle and have removed about 25% of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activities between 2000 and 2007 and about half the anthropogenic CO released since the start of the industrial revolution. Rising ocean temperatures and ocean acidification means that the capacity of the ocean carbon sink will gradually get weaker, giving rise to global concerns expressed in the Monaco and Manado Declarations.\n\nA report from NOAA scientists published in the journal Science in May 2008 found that large amounts of relatively acidified water are upwelling to within four miles of the Pacific continental shelf area of North America. This area is a critical zone where most local marine life lives or is born. While the paper dealt only with areas from Vancouver to northern California, other continental shelf areas may be experiencing similar effects.\n\nA related issue is the methane clathrate reservoirs found under sediments on the ocean floors. These trap large amounts of the greenhouse gas methane, which ocean warming has the potential to release. In 2004 the global inventory of ocean methane clathrates was estimated to occupy between one and five million cubic kilometres. If all these clathrates were to be spread uniformly across the ocean floor, this would translate to a thickness between three and fourteen metres. This estimate corresponds to 500–2500 gigatonnes carbon (Gt C), and can be compared with the 5000 Gt C estimated for all other fossil fuel reserves.\n\nEutrophication is an increase in chemical nutrients, typically compounds containing nitrogen or phosphorus, in an ecosystem. It can result in an increase in the ecosystem's primary productivity (excessive plant growth and decay), and further effects including lack of oxygen and severe reductions in water quality, fish, and other animal populations.\n\nThe biggest culprit are rivers that empty into the ocean, and with it the many chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture as well as waste from livestock and humans. An excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water can lead to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.\n\nEstuaries tend to be naturally eutrophic because land-derived nutrients are concentrated where runoff enters the marine environment in a confined channel. The World Resources Institute has identified 375 hypoxic coastal zones around the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly in Japan. In the ocean, there are frequent red tide algae blooms that kill fish and marine mammals and cause respiratory problems in humans and some domestic animals when the blooms reach close to shore.\n\nIn addition to land runoff, atmospheric anthropogenic fixed nitrogen can enter the open ocean. A study in 2008 found that this could account for around one third of the ocean's external (non-recycled) nitrogen supply and up to three per cent of the annual new marine biological production. It has been suggested that accumulating reactive nitrogen in the environment may have consequences as serious as putting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\nOne proposed solution to eutrophication in estuaries is to restore shellfish populations, such as oysters. Oyster reefs remove nitrogen from the water column and filter out suspended solids, subsequently reducing the likelihood or extent of harmful algal blooms or anoxic conditions. Filter feeding activity is considered beneficial to water quality by controlling phytoplankton density and sequestering nutrients, which can be removed from the system through shellfish harvest, buried in the sediments, or lost through denitrification. Foundational work toward the idea of improving marine water quality through shellfish cultivation to was conducted by Odd Lindahl et al., using mussels in Sweden.\n\nMarine debris is mainly discarded human rubbish which floats on, or is suspended in the ocean. Eighty percent of marine debris is plastic – a component that has been rapidly accumulating since the end of World War II. The mass of plastic in the oceans may be as high as .\n\nDiscarded plastic bags, six pack rings, cigarette butts and other forms of plastic waste which finish up in the ocean present dangers to wildlife and fisheries. Aquatic life can be threatened through entanglement, suffocation, and ingestion.\nFishing nets, usually made of plastic, can be left or lost in the ocean by fishermen. Known as ghost nets, these entangle fish, dolphins, sea turtles, sharks, dugongs, crocodiles, seabirds, crabs, and other creatures, restricting movement, causing starvation, laceration, infection, and, in those that need to return to the surface to breathe, suffocation.\nMany animals that live on or in the sea consume flotsam by mistake, as it often looks similar to their natural prey. Plastic debris, when bulky or tangled, is difficult to pass, and may become permanently lodged in the digestive tracts of these animals. Especially when evolutionary adaptions make it impossible for the likes of turtles to reject plastic bags, which resemble jellyfish when immersed in water, as they have a system in their throat to stop slippery foods from otherwise escaping. Thereby blocking the passage of food and causing death through starvation or infection. \n\nPlastics accumulate because they don't biodegrade in the way many other substances do. They will photodegrade on exposure to the sun, but they do so properly only under dry conditions, and water inhibits this process. In marine environments, photodegraded plastic disintegrates into ever-smaller pieces while remaining polymers, even down to the molecular level. When floating plastic particles photodegrade down to zooplankton sizes, jellyfish attempt to consume them, and in this way the plastic enters the ocean food chain. \n\nMany of these long-lasting pieces end up in the stomachs of marine birds and animals, including sea turtles, and black-footed albatross. In a 2008 Pacific Gyre voyage, Algalita Marine Research Foundation researchers began finding that fish are ingesting plastic fragments and debris. Of the 672 fish caught during that voyage, 35% had ingested plastic pieces. \n\nPlastic debris tends to accumulate at the centre of ocean gyres. The North Pacific Gyre, for example, has collected the so-called \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\", which is now estimated to be one to twenty times the size of Texas (approximately from 700,000 to 15,000,000 square kilometers). It has a very high level of plastic particulate suspended in the upper water column. In samples taken in 1999, the mass of plastic exceeded that of zooplankton (the dominant animal life in the area) by a factor of six. \n\nMidway Atoll, in common with all the Hawaiian Islands, receives substantial amounts of debris from the garbage patch. Ninety percent plastic, this debris accumulates on the beaches of Midway where it becomes a hazard to the bird population of the island. Midway Atoll is home to two-thirds (1.5 million) of the global population of Laysan albatross. Nearly all of these albatross have plastic in their digestive system and one-third of their chicks die.\n\nToxic additives used in the manufacture of plastic materials can leach out into their surroundings when exposed to water. Waterborne hydrophobic pollutants collect and magnify on the surface of plastic debris, thus making plastic far more deadly in the ocean than it would be on land. Hydrophobic contaminants are also known to bioaccumulate in fatty tissues, biomagnifying up the food chain and putting pressure on apex predators. Some plastic additives are known to disrupt the endocrine system when consumed, others can suppress the immune system or decrease reproductive rates. \n\nFloating debris can also absorb persistent organic pollutants from seawater, including PCBs, DDT, and PAHs. Aside from toxic effects, when ingested some of these affect animal brain cells similarly to estradiol, causing hormone disruption in the affected wildlife.\nSaido, a chemist with the College of Pharmacy, conducted a study in Nihon University, Chiba, Japan, that discovered, when plastics eventually decompose, they produce potentially toxic bisphenol A (BPA) and PS oligomer into the water. These toxins are believed to bring harm to the marine life living in the area.\n\nA growing concern regarding plastic pollution in the marine ecosystem is the use of microplastics. Microplastics are little beads of plastic less than 5 millimeters wide, and they are commonly found in hand soaps, face cleansers, and other exfoliators. When these products are used, the microplastics go through the water filtration system and into the ocean, but because of their small size they are likely to escape capture by the preliminary treatment screens on wastewater plants. These beads are harmful to the organisms in the ocean, especially filter feeders, because they can easily ingest the plastic and become sick. The microplastics are such a concern because it is difficult to clean them up due to their size, so humans can try to avoid using these harmful plastics by purchasing products that use natural, environmentally safe exfoliates.\n\nApart from plastics, there are particular problems with other toxins that do not disintegrate rapidly in the marine environment. Examples of persistent toxins are PCBs, DDT, TBT, pesticides, furans, dioxins, phenols, and radioactive waste. Heavy metals are metallic chemical elements that have a relatively high density and are toxic or poisonous at low concentrations. Examples are mercury, lead, nickel, arsenic, and cadmium. Such toxins can accumulate in the tissues of many species of aquatic life in a process called bioaccumulation. They are also known to accumulate in benthic environments, such as estuaries and bay muds: a geological record of human activities of the last century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarine life can be susceptible to noise or the sound pollution from sources such as passing ships, oil exploration seismic surveys, and naval low-frequency active sonar. Sound travels more rapidly and over larger distances in the sea than in the atmosphere. Marine animals, such as cetaceans, often have weak eyesight, and live in a world largely defined by acoustic information. This applies also to many deeper sea fish, who live in a world of darkness. Between 1950 and 1975, ambient noise at one location in the Pacific Ocean increased by about ten decibels (that is a tenfold increase in intensity).\n\nNoise also makes species communicate louder, which is called the Lombard vocal response. Whale songs are longer when submarine-detectors are on. If creatures don't \"speak\" loud enough, their voice can be masked by anthropogenic sounds. These unheard voices might be warnings, finding of prey, or preparations of net-bubbling. When one species begins speaking louder, it will mask other species voices, causing the whole ecosystem to eventually speak louder.\n\nAccording to the oceanographer Sylvia Earle, \"Undersea noise pollution is like the death of a thousand cuts. Each sound in itself may not be a matter of critical concern, but taken all together, the noise from shipping, seismic surveys, and military activity is creating a totally different environment than existed even 50 years ago. That high level of noise is bound to have a hard, sweeping impact on life in the sea.\"\n\nNoise from ships and human activity can damage Cnidarians and Ctenophora, which are very important organisms in the marine ecosystem. They promote high diversity and they are used as models for ecology and biology because of their simple structures. When there is underwater noise, the vibrations in the water damage the cilia hairs in the Coelenterates. In a study, the organisms were exposed to sound waves for different numbers of times and the results showed that damaged hair cells were extruded or missing or presented bent, flaccid or missed kinocilia and stereocilia.\n\nMuch anthropogenic pollution ends up in the ocean. The 2011 edition of the United Nations Environment Programme Year Book identifies as the main emerging environmental issues the loss to the oceans of massive amounts of phosphorus, \"a valuable fertilizer needed to feed a growing global population\", and the impact billions of pieces of plastic waste are having globally on the health of marine environments. \n\nBjorn Jennssen (2003) notes in his article, \"Anthropogenic pollution may reduce biodiversity and productivity of marine ecosystems, resulting in reduction and depletion of human marine food resources\". There are two ways the overall level of this pollution can be mitigated: either the human population is reduced, or a way is found to reduce the ecological footprint left behind by the average human. If the second way is not adopted, then the first way may be imposed as the world ecosystems falter.\n\nThe second way is for humans, individually, to pollute less. That requires social and political will, together with a shift in awareness so more people respect the environment and are less disposed to abuse it. At an operational level, regulations, and international government participation is needed. It is often very difficult to regulate marine pollution because pollution spreads over international barriers, thus making regulations hard to create as well as enforce.\n\nWithout appropriate awareness of marine pollution, the necessary global will to effectively address the issues may prove inadequate. Balanced information on the sources and harmful effects of marine pollution need to become part of general public awareness, and ongoing research is required to fully establish, and keep current, the scope of the issues. As expressed in Daoji and Dag's research, one of the reasons why environmental concern is lacking among the Chinese is because the public awareness is low and therefore should be targeted.\n\nThe amount of awareness on marine pollution is vital to the support of keeping the prevention of trash from entering waterways and ending up in our oceans. The EPA reports that in 2014 Americans generated about 258 million tons of waste, and only a third was recycled or composted. In 2015, there was over 8 million tons of plastic that made it into the ocean. Through more sustainable packing this could lead to; eliminating toxic constituents, using fewer materials, making more readily available recyclable plastic. However, awareness can only take these initiatives so far. The most abundant plastic is PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) and is the most resistant to biodegradables. Researchers have been making great strides in combating this problem. In one way has been by adding a special polymer called a tetrablock copolymer. The tetrablock copolymer acts as a laminate between the PE and iPP which enables for an easier breakdown but still be tough. Through more awareness, individuals will become more cognizant of their carbon footprints. Also, from research and technology, more strides can be made to aid in the plastic pollution problem. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1116600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1116600", "title": "Pantanal", "text": "Pantanal\n\nThe Pantanal () is a natural region encompassing the world's largest tropical wetland area. It is located mostly within the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, but it extends into Mato Grosso and portions of Bolivia and Paraguay. It sprawls over an area estimated at between . Various subregional ecosystems exist, each with distinct hydrological, geological and ecological characteristics; up to 12 of them have been defined (RADAMBRASIL 1982).\n\nRoughly 80% of the Pantanal floodplains are submerged during the rainy seasons, nurturing an astonishing biologically diverse collection of aquatic plants and helping to support a dense array of animal species.\n\nThe name \"Pantanal\" comes from the Portuguese word \"pântano\", meaning wetland, bog, swamp, quagmire or marsh. By comparison, the Brazilian highlands are locally referred to as the \"planalto\", plateau or, literally, high plain.\n\nThe Pantanal is a huge, gently-sloped basin that receives runoff from the upland areas (the Planalto highlands) and slowly releases the water through the Paraguay River and tributaries. The formation is a result of the large, concave pre-Andean depression of the earth's crust, related to the Andean orogeny of the Tertiary. It constitutes an enormous internal river delta, in which several rivers flowing from the surrounding plateau merge, depositing their sediments and erosion residues, which have been filling, throughout the years, the large depression area of the Pantanal. This area is also one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the larger Parana-Paraguay Plain area. \n\nThe Pantanal is bounded by the Chiquitano dry forests to the west and northwest, by the Arid Chaco dry forests to the southwest, and the Humid Chaco to the south. The Cerrado savannas lie to the north, east and southeast.\nThe Pantanal has an average yearly rainfall of , but is fed by the upper Paraguay River. Its average temperature is , but temperatures can fluctuate from .\n\nFloodplain ecosystems such as the Pantanal are defined by their seasonal inundation and desiccation. They shift between phases of standing water and phases of dry soil, when the water table can be well below the root region. Soils range from high levels of sand in higher areas to higher amounts of clay and silt in riverine areas.\n\nElevation of the Pantanal ranges from above sea level. Annual rainfall over the flood basin is between , with most rainfall occurring between November and March. In the Paraguay River portion of the Pantanal, water levels rise between two meters to five meters seasonally; water fluctuations in other parts of the Pantanal are less than this. Flood waters tend to flow slowly ( per second) due to the low gradients and high resistance offered by the dense vegetation.\n\nWhen rising river waters first contact previously dry soil, the waters become oxygen-depleted, rendering the water environs anoxic. Many natural fish kills can occur if there are no oxygenated water refuges available (the reason for this remains speculative: it may be due to the growth of toxin-producing bacteria in the deoxygenated water rather than as a direct result of lack of oxygen (McClain 2002)).\n\nThe vegetation of the Pantanal, often referred to as the \"Pantanal complex\", is a mixture of plant communities typical of a variety of surrounding biome regions: these include moist tropical Amazonian rainforest plants, semiarid woodland plants typical of northeast Brazil, Brazilian \"cerrado\" savanna plants and plants of the \"Chaco\" savannas of Bolivia and Paraguay. Forests usually occur at higher altitudes of the region, while grasslands cover the seasonally inundated areas. The key limiting factors for growth are inundation and, even more importantly, water-stress during the dry season. The Pantanal ecosystem is home to 3500 known plant species.\n\nThe Pantanal ecosystem is also thought to be home to 1000 bird species, 400 fish species, 300 mammalian species, 480 reptile species and over 9000 subspecies of invertebrates.\n\nThe apple snail is a keystone species in Pantanal's ecosystem. When the wetlands are flooded once a year, the grass and other plants will eventually die and start to decay. During this process, decomposing microbes deplete the shallow water of all oxygen, suffocating larger decomposers. Unlike other decomposing animals, the apple snail have both gills and lungs, making it possible for them to thrive in anoxic waters where they recycle the nutrients. To get oxygen, they extend a long snorkel to the water surface, pumping air into their lungs. This ability allows them to consume all the dead plant matter and turn it into nutritious fertilizer available for the plants in the area. The snails themselves are also food for a variety of animals.\n\nAmong the rarest animals to inhabit the wetland of the Pantanal are the marsh deer (\"Blastocerus dichotomus\") and the giant river otter (\"Pteroneura brasiliensis\"). Parts of the Pantanal are also home to the following endangered or threatened species: the hyacinth macaw (\"Anodorhyncus hyacinthinus\") (a bird endangered due to smuggling), the crowned solitary eagle, the maned wolf (\"Chrysocyon brachyurus\"), the bush dog (\"Speothos venaticus\"), the South American tapir (\"Tapirus terrestris\") and the giant anteater (\"Myrmecophaga tridactyla\"). Common species in the Pantanal include the capybara (\"Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris\") and the yacare caiman (\"Caiman yacare\"). According to 1996 data, there were 10 million caimans in the Pantanal, making it the highest concentration of crocodilians in the World. The Pantanal is home to one of the largest and healthiest jaguar (\"Panthera onca\") populations on Earth.\n\nMost fish are detritivores, primarily ingesting fine particles from sediments and plant surfaces. This is characteristic of fish living in South American flood-plains in general. Fish migration between river channels and flood-plain regions occurs seasonally. These fish have many adaptations that allow them to survive in the oxygen-depleted flood-plain waters.\n\nIn addition to the caiman, some of the reptiles that inhabit the Pantanal are the yellow anaconda (\"Eunectes notaeus\"), the gold tegu (\"Tupinambis teguixin\"), the red-footed tortoise (\"Geochelone carbonaria\") and the green iguana (\"Iguana iguana\").\n\nThe Pantanal region includes essential sanctuaries for migratory birds, critical nursery grounds for aquatic life, and refuges for such creatures as the yacare caiman, deer, and Pantanal jaguar.\n\nThe main human activities which threaten the Pantanal ecosystems are:\n\nA portion of the Pantanal in Brazil has been protected as the Pantanal Matogrossense National Park. This park, established in September 1981, is located in the municipality of Poconé in the State of Mato Grosso, between the mouths of the Baía de São Marcos and the Gurupi Rivers. The park was designated a Ramsar Site of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention on May 24, 1993.\n\nThe SESC Pantanal Private Natural Heritage Reserve (\"Reserva Particular do Patrimonio Natural SESC Pantanal\") is a privately owned reserve in Brazil, established in 1998 and in size. It is located in the north-eastern portion, known as \"Poconé\" Pantanal, not far from the Pantanal National Park. It is a mix of permanent rivers, seasonal streams, permanent and seasonal floodplain freshwater lakes, shrub-dominated wetlands and seasonally flooded forests, all dedicated to nature preservation, and was designated a Ramsar Site of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention.\n\nOtuquis National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area is a national park of Bolivia in the Pantanal. The entrance to Otuquis National park is through the town of Puerto Suarez. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "176813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176813", "title": "Physical geodesy", "text": "Physical geodesy\n\nPhysical geodesy is the study of the physical properties of the gravity field of the Earth, the geopotential, with a view to their application in geodesy.\n\nTraditional geodetic instruments such as theodolites rely on the gravity field for orienting their vertical axis along the local plumb line or local vertical direction with the aid of a spirit level. After that, vertical angles (zenith angles or, alternatively, elevation angles) are obtained with respect to this local vertical, and horizontal angles in the plane of the local horizon, perpendicular to the vertical.\n\nLevelling instruments again are used to obtain geopotential differences between points on the Earth's surface. These can then be expressed as \"height\" differences by conversion to metric units.\n\nThe Earth's gravity field can be described by a potential as follows: \n\nwhich expresses the gravity acceleration vector as the gradient of formula_2, the potential of gravity. The vector triad formula_3 is the orthonormal set of base vectors in space, pointing along the formula_4 coordinate axes.\n\nNote that both gravity and its potential contain a contribution from the centrifugal pseudo-force due to the Earth's rotation. We can write\n\nwhere formula_6 is the potential of the \"gravitational\" field, formula_2 that of the \"gravity\" field, and formula_8 that of the centrifugal force field.\n\nThe centrifugal force -- per unit of mass, i.e., acceleration -- is given by\n\nwhere \n\nis the vector pointing to the point considered straight from the Earth's rotational axis. \nIt can be shown that this pseudo-force field, in a reference frame co-rotating with the Earth, has a potential associated with it that looks like this:\n\nThis can be verified by taking the gradient (formula_12) operator of this expression. \n\nHere, formula_13, formula_14 and formula_15 are geocentric coordinates.\n\nGravity is commonly measured in units of m·s (metres per second squared). This also can be expressed (multiplying by the gravitational constant G in order to change units) as newtons per kilogram of attracted mass. \n\nPotential is expressed as gravity times distance, m·s. Travelling one metre in the direction of a gravity vector of strength 1 m·s will increase your potential by 1 m·s. Again employing G as a multipier, the units can be changed to joules per kilogram of attracted mass.\n\nA more convenient unit is the GPU, or geopotential unit: it equals 10 m·s. This means that travelling one metre in the vertical direction, i.e., the direction of the 9.8 m·s ambient gravity, will \"approximately\" change your potential by 1 GPU. Which again means that the difference in geopotential, in GPU, of a point with that of sea level can be used as a rough measure of height \"above sea level\" in metres.\n\nTo a rough approximation, the Earth is a sphere, or to a much better approximation, an ellipsoid. We can similarly approximate the gravity field of the Earth by a spherically symmetric field:\n\nof which the \"equipotential surfaces\"—the surfaces of constant potential value—are concentric spheres.\n\nIt is more accurate to approximate the geopotential by a field that has \"the Earth reference ellipsoid\" as one of its equipotential surfaces, however. The most recent Earth reference ellipsoid is GRS80, or Geodetic Reference System 1980, which the Global Positioning system uses as its reference. Its geometric parameters are: semi-major axis \"a\" = 6378137.0 m, and flattening \"f\" = 1/298.257222101.\n\nA geopotential field formula_17 is constructed, being the sum of a gravitational potential formula_18 and the known centrifugal potential formula_8, that \"has the GRS80 reference ellipsoid as one of its equipotential surfaces\". If we also require that the enclosed mass is equal to the known mass of the Earth (including atmosphere) \"GM\" = 3986005 × 10 m·s, we obtain for the \"potential at the reference ellipsoid:\"\n\nObviously, this value depends on the assumption that the potential goes asymptotically to zero at infinity (formula_21), as is common in physics. For practical purposes it makes more sense to choose the zero point of normal gravity to be that of the reference ellipsoid, and refer the potentials of other points to this.\n\nOnce a clean, smooth geopotential field formula_17 has been constructed matching the known GRS80 reference ellipsoid with an equipotential surface (we call such a field a \"normal potential\") we can subtract it from the true (measured) potential formula_2 of the real Earth. The result is defined as T, the \"disturbing potential\":\n\nThe disturbing potential T is numerically a great deal smaller than U or W, and captures the detailed, complex variations of the true gravity field of the actually existing Earth from point-to-point, as distinguished from the overall global trend captured by the smooth mathematical ellipsoid of the normal potential.\n\nDue to the irregularity of the Earth's true gravity field, the equilibrium figure of sea water, or the geoid, will also be of irregular form. In some places, like west of Ireland, the geoid—mathematical mean sea level—sticks out as much as 100 m above the regular, rotationally symmetric reference ellipsoid of GRS80; in other places, like close to Ceylon, it dives under the ellipsoid by nearly the same amount. The separation between these two surfaces is called the undulation of the geoid, symbol formula_25, and is closely related to the disturbing potential.\n\nAccording to the famous Bruns formula, we have\n\nwhere formula_27 is the force of gravity computed from the normal field potential formula_17.\n\nIn 1849, the mathematician George Gabriel Stokes published the following formula named after him:\n\nIn this formula, formula_30 stands for \"gravity anomalies\", differences between true and normal (reference) gravity, and \"S\" is the \"Stokes function\", a kernel function derived by Stokes in closed analytical form.\n\nNote that determining formula_25 anywhere on Earth by this formula requires formula_30 to be known \"everywhere on Earth\", including oceans, polar areas, and deserts. For terrestrial gravimetric measurements this is a near-impossibility, in spite of close international co-operation within the International Association of Geodesy (IAG), e.g., through the International Gravity Bureau (BGI, Bureau Gravimétrique International). \n\nAnother approach is to \"combine\" multiple information sources: not just terrestrial gravimetry, but also satellite geodetic data on the figure of the Earth, from analysis of satellite orbital perturbations, and lately from satellite gravity missions such as GOCE and GRACE. In such combination solutions, the low-resolution part of the geoid solution is provided by the satellite data, while a 'tuned' version of the above Stokes equation is used to calculate the high-resolution part, from terrestrial gravimetric data from a neighbourhood of the evaluation point only.\n\nThe geoid, or mathematical mean sea surface, is defined not only on the seas, but also under land; it is the equilibrium water surface that would result, would sea water be allowed to move freely (e.g., through tunnels) under the land. Technically, an \"equipotential surface\" of the true geopotential, chosen to coincide (on average) with mean sea level.\n\nAs mean sea level is physically realized by tide gauge bench marks on the coasts of different countries and continents, a number of slightly incompatible \"near-geoids\" will result, with differences of several decimetres to over one metre between them, due to the dynamic sea surface topography. These are referred to as \"vertical\" or \"height datums\".\n\nFor every point on Earth, the local direction of gravity or vertical direction, materialized with the plumb line, is \"perpendicular\" to the geoid. On this is based a method, \"astrogeodetic levelling\", for deriving the local figure of the geoid by measuring \"deflections of the vertical\" by astronomical means over an area.\n\nAbove we already made use of \"gravity anomalies\" formula_30. These are computed as the differences between true (observed) gravity formula_34, and calculated (normal) gravity formula_35. (This is an oversimplification; in practice the location in space at which γ is evaluated will differ slightly from that where \"g\" has been measured.) We thus get \n\nThese anomalies are called free-air anomalies, and are the ones to be used in the above Stokes equation.\n\nIn geophysics, these anomalies are often further reduced by removing from them the \"attraction of the topography\", which for a flat, horizontal plate (Bouguer plate) of thickness \"H\" is given by\n\nThe Bouguer reduction to be applied as follows:\n\nso-called Bouguer anomalies. Here, formula_39 is our earlier formula_30, the free-air anomaly.\n\nIn case the terrain is not a flat plate (the usual case!) we use for \"H\" the local terrain height value but apply a further correction called the terrain correction (\"TC\").\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39674", "title": "Planetary nebula", "text": "Planetary nebula\n\nA planetary nebula, abbreviated as PN or plural PNe, is a type of emission nebula consisting of an expanding, glowing shell of ionized gas ejected from red giant stars late in their lives. \n\nThe term \"planetary nebula\" is arguably a misnomer, since this phenomenon is not associated with observations of actual planets, and perhaps was derived from the planet-like round shape of these nebulae as observed by astronomers through early telescopes. The term may have originated in the 1780s with the English astronomer William Herschel who described these nebulae as resembling planets; however, as early as January 1779, the French astronomer Antoine Darquier de Pellepoix described in his observations of the Ring Nebula, \"...a very dim but perfectly outlined; it is as large as Jupiter and resembles a fading planet\". Whatever the true origin of the term, the label \"planetary nebula\" became ingrained in the terminology used by astronomers to categorize these types of nebulae, and is still used by astronomers today. \n\nMost planetary nebulae form at the end of the star's life, and are a relatively short-lived phenomenon, lasting perhaps a few tens of thousands of years, compared to a typical stellar lifetime spanning several billion years. Once most of the red giant's atmosphere is dissipated, ultraviolet radiation from the hot luminous core, called a planetary nebula nucleus (PNN), ionizes the ejected material. Absorbed ultraviolet light then energises the shell of nebulous gas around the central star, causing it to appear as a brightly coloured planetary nebula.\n\nPlanetary nebulae likely play a crucial role in the chemical evolution of the Milky Way by expelling elements to the interstellar medium from stars where those elements were created. Planetary nebulae are observed in more distant galaxies, yielding useful information about their chemical abundances.\n\nStarting from the 1990s, Hubble Space Telescope images revealed that many planetary nebulae have extremely complex and varied morphologies. About one-fifth are roughly spherical, but the majority are not spherically symmetric. The mechanisms that produce such a wide variety of shapes and features are not yet well understood, but binary central stars, stellar winds and magnetic fields may play a role.\n\nThe first planetary nebula discovered (though not yet termed as such) was the Dumbbell Nebula in the constellation of Vulpecula. It was observed by Charles Messier in 1764 and listed as M27 in his catalogue of nebulous objects. To early observers with low-resolution telescopes, M27 and subsequently discovered planetary nebulae resembled the giant planets like Uranus. William Herschel, discoverer of Uranus, perhaps coined the term \"planetary nebula\". However, in as early as January 1779, the French astronomer Antoine Darquier de Pellepoix described in his observations of the Ring Nebula, \"a very dull nebula, but perfectly outlined; as large as Jupiter and looks like a fading planet.\"\" Whatever the true origin of the term, the label \"planetary nebula\" became ingrained in the terminology used by astronomers to categorize these types of nebulae, and is still in-use by astronomers today.\n\nThe true nature of these objects was uncertain, and Herschel first thought the objects were stars surrounded by material that was condensing into planets rather than what is now known to be evidence of dead stars that have incinerated any orbiting planets. In , William Herschel had discovered the object now known as NGC 7009 (the \"Saturn Nebula\"), upon which he used the term \"planetary nebula\".\n\nIn 1785, Herschel wrote to Jerome Lalande: \"These are celestial bodies of which as yet we have no clear idea and which are perhaps of a type quite different from those that we are familiar with in the heavens. I have already found four that have a visible diameter of between 15 and 30 seconds. These bodies appear to have a disk that is rather like a planet, that is to say, of equal brightness all over, round or somewhat oval, and about as well defined in outline as the disk of the planets, of a light strong enough to be visible with an ordinary telescope of only one foot, yet they have only the appearance of a star of about ninth magnitude.\"\n\nHerschel assigned these to Class IV of his catalogue of \"nebulae\", eventually listing 78 \"planetary nebulae\", most of which are in fact galaxies.\n\nThe nature of planetary nebulae remained unknown until the first spectroscopic observations were made in the mid-19th century. Using a prism to disperse their light, William Huggins was one of the earliest astronomers to study the optical spectra of astronomical objects.\n\nOn August 29, 1864, Huggins was the first to analyze the spectrum of a planetary nebula when he observed Cat's Eye Nebula. His observations of stars had shown that their spectra consisted of a continuum of radiation with many dark lines superimposed. He found that many nebulous objects such as the Andromeda Nebula (as it was then known) had spectra that were quite similar. However, when Huggins looked at the Cat's Eye Nebula, he found a very different spectrum. Rather than a strong continuum with absorption lines superimposed, the Cat's Eye Nebula and other similar objects showed a number of emission lines. Brightest of these was at a wavelength of 500.7 nanometres, which did not correspond with a line of any known element.\n\nAt first, it was hypothesized that the line might be due to an unknown element, which was named nebulium. A similar idea had led to the discovery of helium through analysis of the Sun's spectrum in 1868. While helium was isolated on Earth soon after its discovery in the spectrum of the Sun, \"nebulium\" was not. In the early 20th century, Henry Norris Russell proposed that, rather than being a new element, the line at 500.7 nm was due to a familiar element in unfamiliar conditions.\n\nPhysicists showed in the 1920s that in gas at extremely low densities, electrons can occupy excited metastable energy levels in atoms and ions that would otherwise be de-excited by collisions that would occur at higher densities. Electron transitions from these levels in nitrogen and oxygen ions (, (a.k.a. O ), and ) give rise to the 500.7 nm emission line and others. These spectral lines, which can only be seen in very low density gases, are called \"forbidden lines\". Spectroscopic observations thus showed that nebulae were made of extremely rarefied gas.\n\nThe central stars of planetary nebulae are very hot. Only when a star has exhausted most of its nuclear fuel can it collapse to a small size. Planetary nebulae came to be understood as a final stage of stellar evolution. Spectroscopic observations show that all planetary nebulae are expanding. This led to the idea that planetary nebulae were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space at the end of its life.\n\nTowards the end of the 20th century, technological improvements helped to further the study of planetary nebulae. Space telescopes allowed astronomers to study light wavelengths outside those that the Earth's atmosphere transmits. Infrared and ultraviolet studies of planetary nebulae allowed much more accurate determinations of nebular temperatures, densities and elemental abundances. Charge-coupled device technology allowed much fainter spectral lines to be measured accurately than had previously been possible. The Hubble Space Telescope also showed that while many nebulae appear to have simple and regular structures when observed from the ground, the very high optical resolution achievable by telescopes above the Earth's atmosphere reveals extremely complex structures.\n\nUnder the Morgan-Keenan spectral classification scheme, planetary nebulae are classified as \"Type-P\", although this notation is seldom used in practice.\n\nStars greater than 8 solar masses (M) will likely end their lives in dramatic supernovae explosions, while planetary nebulae seemingly only occur at the end of the lives of intermediate and low mass stars between 0.8 M to 8.0 M. Progenitor stars that form planetary nebulae will spend most of their lifetimes converting their hydrogen into helium in the star's core by nuclear fusion at about 15 million K. This generated energy creates outward pressure from fusion reactions in the core, balancing the crushing inward pressures of the star's gravity. This state of equilibrium is known as the main sequence, which can last for tens of millions to billions of years, depending on the mass.\n\nWhen the hydrogen source in the core starts to diminish, gravity starts compressing the core, causing a rise in temperature to about 100 million K. Such higher core temperatures then make the star's cooler outer layers expand to create much larger red giant stars. This end phase causes a dramatic rise in stellar luminosity, where the released energy is distributed over a much larger surface area, even though the average surface temperature is lower. In stellar evolution terms, stars undergoing such increases in luminosity are known as asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB). During this phase, the star can lose 50 to 70% of its total mass from its stellar wind.\n\nFor the more massive asymptotic giant branch stars that form planetary nebulae, whose progenitors exceed about 3M, their cores will continue to contract. When temperatures reach about 100 million K, the available helium nuclei fuse into carbon and oxygen, so that the star again resumes radiating energy, temporarily stopping the core's contraction. This new helium burning phase (fusion of helium nuclei) forms a growing inner core of inert carbon and oxygen. Above it is a thin helium-burning shell, surrounded in turn by a hydrogen-burning shell. However, this new phase lasts only 20,000 years or so, a short period compared to the entire lifetime of the star.\n\nIn either scenario, the venting of atmosphere continues unabated into interstellar space, but when the outer surface of the exposed core reaches temperatures exceeding about 30,000 K, there are enough emitted ultraviolet photons to ionize the ejected atmosphere, causing the gas to shine as a planetary nebula.\n\nAfter a star passes through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, the short planetary nebula phase of stellar evolution begins as gases blow away from the central star at speeds of a few kilometers per second. The central star is the remnant of its AGB progenitor, an electron-degenerate carbon-oxygen core that has lost most of its hydrogen envelope due to mass loss on the AGB. As the gases expand, the central star undergoes a two-stage evolution, first growing hotter as it continues to contract and hydrogen fusion reactions occur in the shell around the core and then slowly cooling when the hydrogen shell is exhausted through fusion and mass loss. In the second phase, it radiates away its energy and fusion reactions cease, as the central star is not heavy enough to generate the core temperatures required for carbon and oxygen to fuse. During the first phase, the central star maintains constant luminosity, while at the same time it grows ever hotter, eventually reaching temperatures around 100,000 K. In the second phase, it cools so much that it does not give off enough ultraviolet radiation to ionize the increasingly distant gas cloud. The star becomes a white dwarf, and the expanding gas cloud becomes invisible to us, ending the planetary nebula phase of evolution. For a typical planetary nebula, about 10,000 years passes between its formation and recombination of the resulting plasma.\n\nPlanetary nebulae may play a very important role in galactic evolution. Newly born stars consist almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, but as stars evolve through the asymptotic giant branch phase, they create heavier elements via nuclear fusion which are eventually expelled by strong stellar winds. Planetary nebulae usually contain larger proportions of elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, and these are recycled into the interstellar medium via these powerful winds. In turn, planetary nebulae greatly enrich the Milky Way and their nebulae with these heavier elements – collectively known by astronomers as \"metals\" and specifically referred to by the metallicity parameter \"Z\".\n\nSubsequent generations of stars formed from such nebulae also tend to have higher metallicities. Although these metals are present in stars in relatively tiny amounts, they have marked effects on stellar evolution and fusion reactions. When stars formed earlier in the universe they theoretically contained smaller quantities of heavier elements. Known examples are the metal poor Population II stars. (See Stellar population).\nIdentification of stellar metallicity content is found by spectroscopy.\n\nA typical planetary nebula is roughly one light year across, and consists of extremely rarefied gas, with a density generally from 100 to 10,000 particles . (The Earth's atmosphere, by comparison, contains 2.5 particles .) Young planetary nebulae have the highest densities, sometimes as high as 10 particles . As nebulae age, their expansion causes their density to decrease. The masses of planetary nebulae range from 0.1 to 1 solar masses.\n\nRadiation from the central star heats the gases to temperatures of about 10,000 K. The gas temperature in central regions is usually much higher than at the periphery reaching 16,000–25,000 K. The volume in the vicinity of the central star is often filled with a very hot (coronal) gas having the temperature of about 1,000,000 K. This gas originates from the surface of the central star in the form of the fast stellar wind.\n\nNebulae may be described as \"matter bounded\" or \"radiation bounded\". In the former case, there is not enough matter in the nebula to absorb all the UV photons emitted by the star, and the visible nebula is fully ionized. In the latter case, there are not enough UV photons being emitted by the central star to ionize all the surrounding gas, and an ionization front propagates outward into the circumstellar envelope of neutral atoms.\n\nAbout 3000 planetary nebulae are now known to exist in our galaxy, out of 200 billion stars. Their very short lifetime compared to total stellar lifetime accounts for their rarity. They are found mostly near the plane of the Milky Way, with the greatest concentration near the galactic center.\n\nOnly about 20% of planetary nebulae are spherically symmetric (for example, see Abell 39). A wide variety of shapes exist with some very complex forms seen. Planetary nebulae are classified by different authors into: stellar, disk, ring, irregular, helical, bipolar, quadrupolar, and other types, although the majority of them belong to just three types: spherical, elliptical and bipolar. Bipolar nebulae are concentrated in the galactic plane, likely produced by relatively young massive progenitor stars; and bipolars in the galactic bulge appear to prefer orienting their orbital axes parallel to the galactic plane. On the other hand, spherical nebulae are likely produced by the old stars similar to the Sun.\n\nThe huge variety of the shapes is partially the projection effect—the same nebula when viewed under different angles will appear different. Nevertheless, the reason for the huge variety of physical shapes is not fully understood. Gravitational interactions with companion stars if the central stars are binary stars may be one cause. Another possibility is that planets disrupt the flow of material away from the star as the nebula forms. It has been determined that the more massive stars produce more irregularly shaped nebulae. In January 2005, astronomers announced the first detection of magnetic fields around the central stars of two planetary nebulae, and hypothesized that the fields might be partly or wholly responsible for their remarkable shapes.\n\nPlanetary nebulae have been detected as members in four Galactic globular clusters: Messier 15, Messier 22, NGC 6441 and Palomar 6. Evidence also points to the potential discovery of planetary nebulae in globular clusters in the galaxy M31. However, there is currently only one case of a planetary nebula discovered in an open cluster that is agreed upon by independent researchers. That case pertains to the planetary nebula PHR 1315-6555 and the open cluster Andrews-Lindsay 1. Indeed, through cluster membership PHR 1315-6555 possesses among the most precise distances established for a planetary nebula (i.e., a 4% distance solution). The cases of NGC 2818 and NGC 2348 in Messier 46, exhibit mismatched velocities between the planetary nebulae and the clusters, which indicates they are line-of-sight coincidences. A subsample of \"tentative\" cases that may potentially be cluster/PN pairs includes Abell 8 and Bica 6, and He 2-86 and NGC 4463.\n\nTheoretical models predict that planetary nebulae can form from main-sequence stars of between one and eight solar masses, which puts the progenitor star's age at greater than 40 million years. Although there are a few hundred known open clusters within that age range, a variety of reasons limit the chances of finding a planetary nebula within. For one reason, the planetary nebula phase for more massive stars is on the order of thousands of years, which is a blink of the eye in cosmic terms. Also, partly because of their small total mass, open clusters have relatively poor gravitational cohesion and tend to disperse after a relatively short time, typically from 100 to 600 million years.\n\nThe distances to planetary nebulae are generally poorly determined. It is possible to determine distances to the nearest planetary nebula by measuring their expansion rates. High resolution observations taken several years apart will show the expansion of the nebula perpendicular to the line of sight, while spectroscopic observations of the Doppler shift will reveal the velocity of expansion in the line of sight. Comparing the angular expansion with the derived velocity of expansion will reveal the distance to the nebula.\n\nThe issue of how such a diverse range of nebular shapes can be produced is a debatable topic. It is theorised that interactions between material moving away from the star at different speeds gives rise to most observed shapes. However, some astronomers postulate that close binary central stars might be responsible for the more complex and extreme planetary nebulae. Several have been shown to exhibit strong magnetic fields, and their interactions with ionized gas could explain some planetary nebulae shapes.\n\nThere are two main methods of determining metal abundances in nebulae. These rely on recombination lines and collisionally excited lines. Large discrepancies are sometimes seen between the results derived from the two methods. This may be explained by the presence of small temperature fluctuations within planetary nebulae. The discrepancies may be too large to be caused by temperature effects, and some hypothesize the existence of cold knots containing very little hydrogen to explain the observations. However, such knots have yet to be observed.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In April 2012, a motion of no confidence written by the Social-Democrats led to the fall of the Ungureanu government. The motion of no confidence blamed the government for approving shale gas extraction without an appropriate legislative framework and without any geological studies.\n\nWhen the Social-Democratic Party took power, its May 2012 party programme proposed the \"immediate establishment of a moratorium on shale gas until the studies that are ongoing at European level on the environmental impacts of hydraulic fractionation process\".\n\nIn June 2012, a proposal by several Vaslui County deputies to ban shale gas extraction through fracking was rejected by the Victor Ponta government, being also rejected by the Senate. Soon after, Ponta announced that the government would re-analyze its position on shale gas. In July 2012, PM Ponta announced that retired general Wesley Clark (who was working for shale gas company BNK Petroleum) would become an adviser of the Romanian government, fueling speculations of a change of policy regarding shale gas and fracking.\n\nFollowing negotiations with petroleum corporation Chevron in December 2012, Ponta announced in January 2013 a reversal of the policies, saying that shale gas extraction \"should be considered as something positive\". The first permissions for the exploration of shale gas were given a few days later in January 2013.\n\nAmerican corporation Chevron has the rights to extract shale gas from a combined area of 870,000 hectares around Bârlad, as well as from several areas in Dobruja (Adamclisi, Vama Veche and Costinești), under 30-year contracts that can be extended for another 15 years.\n\nThe gas extraction rights for the Bârlad area were sold by Frank Timiș's Regal Petroleum to Chevron in 2010 for $25 million. Chevron was given in January 2013 the permission for exploration of shale gas in Bârlad and a few months later, in May 2013, it was also given permission for the exploration of the gas fields along the southern Romanian Black Sea coast. The royalties given to the Romanian state are between 3.5% and 13%, depending on the sizes of the deposits.\n\nThe exploratory drillings were supposed to start in October 2013 in Pungești, Vaslui County, however, following protests both in the village and in Bucharest, Chevron decided to suspend its activities. The Pungești local council announced the organization of a non-binding local referendum on the issue.\n\nProtests against shale gas were held in several major cities including Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Constanța, as well as in the areas where the exploitations will be done, including in the city of Vaslui and the village of Pungești. A small village in Vaslui County became a center of resistance against exploitation of shale gas.\n"}

Positive ions are considered in most cases below. \nThe stopping power depends on the type and energy of the radiation and on the properties of the material it passes. Since the production of an ion pair (usually a positive ion and a (negative) electron) requires a fixed amount of energy (for example, 33.97 eV in dry air), the number of ionizations per path length is proportional to the stopping power. The \"stopping power\" of the material is numerically equal to the loss of energy \"E\" per unit path length, \"x\":\n\nThe minus sign makes S positive.\n\nThe equation above defines the linear stopping power which in the international system is expressed in N but is usually indicated in other units like MeV/mm or similar.

One therefore often divides the force by the density of the material to obtain the mass stopping power which in the international system is expressed in m/s but is usually found in units like MeV/(mg/cm) or similar. The mass stopping power then depends only very little on the density of the material.\n\nThe picture shows how the stopping power of 5.49 MeV alpha particles increases while the particle traverses air, until it reaches the maximum. This particular energy corresponds to that of the alpha particle radiation from naturally radioactive gas radon (Rn) which is present in the air in minute amounts.\n\nThe mean range can be calculated by integrating the reciprocal stopping power over energy:\n\nwhere:\n\nThe deposited energy can be obtained by integrating the stopping power over the entire path length of the ion while it moves in the material.\n\nElectronic stopping refers to the slowing down of a projectile ion due to the inelastic collisions between bound electrons in the medium and the ion moving through it. The term inelastic is used to signify that energy is lost during the process (the collisions may result both in excitations of bound electrons of the medium, and in excitations of the electron cloud of the ion as well). Linear electronic stopping power is identical to unrestricted linear energy transfer.\n\nInstead of energy transfer, some models consider the electronic stopping power as momentum transfer between electron gas and energetic ion. This is consistent with the result of Bethe in the high energy range.\n\nSince the number of collisions an ion experiences with electrons is large, and since the charge state of the ion while traversing the medium may change frequently, it is very difficult to describe all possible interactions for all possible ion charge states. Instead, the electronic stopping power is often given as a simple function of energy formula_3 which is an average taken over all energy loss processes for different charge states. It can be theoretically determined to an accuracy of a few % in the energy range above several hundred keV per nucleon from theoretical treatments, the best known being the Bethe formula. At energies lower than about 100 keV per nucleon, it becomes more difficult to determine the electronic stopping theoretically.\n\nGraphical presentations of experimental values of the electronic stopping power for many ions in many substances have been given by Paul. The accuracy of various stopping tables has been determined using statistical comparisons.\n\nNuclear stopping power refers to the elastic collisions between the projectile ion and atoms in the sample (the established designation \"nuclear\" may be confusing since nuclear stopping is not due to nuclear forces, but it is meant to note that this type of stopping involves the interaction of the ion with the \"nuclei\" in the target). If one knows the form of the repulsive potential energy formula_4 between two atoms (see below), it is possible to calculate the nuclear stopping power formula_5. In the stopping power figure shown above for aluminium ions in aluminum, nuclear stopping is negligible except at the lowest energy. Nuclear stopping increases when the mass of the ion increases. In the figure shown on the right, nuclear stopping is larger than electronic stopping at low energy. For very light ions slowing down in heavy materials, the nuclear stopping is weaker than the electronic at all energies.\n\nEspecially in the field of radiation damage in detectors, the term \"non-ionizing energy loss\" (NIEL) is used as a term opposite to the linear energy transfer (LET), see e.g. Refs. Since per definition nuclear stopping power does not involve electronic excitations, NIEL and nuclear stopping can be considered to be the same quantity in the absence of nuclear reactions.\n\nThe total non-relativistic stopping power is therefore the sum of two terms: formula_6. Several semi-empirical stopping power formulas have been devised. The model given by Ziegler, Biersack and Littmark (the so-called \"ZBL\" stopping, see next chapter), implemented in different versions of the TRIM/SRIM codes, is used most often today.\n\nAt extremely high ion energies, one also has to consider radiative stopping power which is due to the emission of bremsstrahlung in the electric fields of the particles in the material traversed. For electron projectiles, radiative stopping is always important. At high ion energies, there may also be energy losses due to nuclear reactions, but such processes are not normally described by stopping power.\n\nClose to the surface of a solid target material, both nuclear and electronic stopping may lead to sputtering.\n\nIn the beginning of the slowing-down process at high energies, the ion is slowed down mainly by electronic stopping, and it moves almost in a straight path. When the ion has slowed down sufficiently, the collisions with nuclei (the nuclear stopping) become more and more probable, finally dominating the slowing down. When atoms of the solid receive significant recoil energies when struck by the ion, they will be removed from their lattice positions, and produce a cascade of further collisions in the material. These \ncollision cascades are the main cause of damage production during ion implantation in metals and semiconductors.\n\nWhen the energies of all atoms in the system have fallen below the threshold displacement energy, the production of new damage ceases, and the concept of nuclear stopping is no longer meaningful.\nThe total amount of energy deposited by the nuclear collisions to atoms in the materials is called the nuclear deposited energy.\n\nThe inset in the figure shows a typical range distribution of ions deposited in the solid. The case shown here might, for instance, be the slowing down of a 1 MeV silicon ion in silicon. The mean range for a 1 MeV ion is typically in the micrometer range.\n\nAt very small distances between the nuclei the repulsive interaction can be regarded as essentially Coulombic. At greater distances, the electron clouds screen the nuclei from each other. Thus the repulsive potential can be described by multiplying the Coulombic repulsion between nuclei with a screening function φ(r/a),\n\nwhere φ(r/a) → 1 when r → 0. Here formula_8 and formula_9 are the charges of the interacting nuclei, and \"r\" the distance between them; \"a\" is the so-called screening parameter.\n\nA large number of different repulsive potentials and screening functions have been proposed over the years, some determined semi-empirically, others from theoretical calculations. A much used repulsive potential is the one given by Ziegler, Biersack and Littmark, the so-called ZBL repulsive potential. It has been constructed by fitting a universal screening function to theoretically obtained potentials calculated for a large variety of atom pairs. The ZBL screening parameter and function have the forms\n\nand\n\nwhere \"x = r/a\", and \"a\" is the Bohr atomic radius = 0.529 Å.\n\nThe standard deviation of the fit of the universal ZBL repulsive potential to the theoretically calculated pair-specific potentials it is fit to is 18% above 2 eV. \nEven more accurate repulsive potentials can be obtained from self-consistent total energy calculations using density-functional theory and the local-density approximation \n(LDA) for electronic exchange and correlation.\n\nIn crystalline materials the ion may in some instances get \"channeled\", i.e., get focused into a channel between crystal planes where it experiences almost no collisions with nuclei. Also, the electronic stopping power may be weaker in the channel. Thus the nuclear and electronic stopping do not only depend on material type and density but also on its microscopic structure and cross-section.\n\nComputer simulation methods to calculate the motion of ions in a medium have been developed since the 1960s, and are now the dominant way of treating stopping power theoretically. The basic idea in them is to follow the movement of the ion in the medium by simulating the collisions with nuclei in the medium. The electronic stopping power is usually taken into account as a frictional force slowing down the ion.\n\nConventional methods used to calculate ion ranges are based on the binary collision approximation (BCA). In these methods the movement of ions in the implanted sample is treated as a succession of individual collisions between the recoil ion and atoms in the sample. For each individual collision the classical scattering integral is solved by numerical integration.\n\nThe impact parameter \"p\" in the scattering integral is determined either from a stochastic distribution or in a way that takes into account the crystal structure of the sample. The former method is suitable only in simulations of implantation into amorphous materials, as it does not account for channeling.\n\nThe best known BCA simulation program is TRIM/SRIM (acronym for TRansport of Ions in Matter, in more recent versions called Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter), which is based on the ZBL electronic stopping and interatomic potential. It has a very easy-to-use user interface, and has default parameters for all ions in all materials up to an ion energy of 1 GeV, which has made it immensely popular. However, it doesn't take account of the crystal structure, which severely limits its usefulness in many cases. Several BCA programs overcome this difficulty; some fairly well known are MARLOWE, BCCRYS and crystal-TRIM.\n\nAlthough the BCA methods have been successfully used in describing many physical processes, they have some obstacles for describing the slowing down process of energetic ions realistically. Basic assumption that collisions are binary results in severe problems when trying to take multiple interactions into account. Also, in simulating crystalline materials the selection process of the next colliding lattice atom and the impact parameter \"p\" always involve several parameters which may not have perfectly well defined values, which may affect the results 10–20% even for quite reasonable-seeming choices of the parameter values. The best reliability in BCA is obtained by including multiple collisions in the calculations, which is not easy to do correctly. However, at least MARLOWE does this.\n\nA fundamentally more straightforward way to model multiple atomic collisions is provided by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in which the time evolution of a system of atoms is calculated by solving the equations of motion numerically. Special MD methods have been devised in which the number of interactions and atoms involved in MD simulations have been reduced in order to make them efficient enough for calculating ion ranges. The MD simulations this automatically describe the nuclear stopping power. The electronic stopping power can be readily included in molecular dynamics simulations, either as a frictional force \n\nBeyond the maximum, stopping power decreases approximately like \"1/v\" with increasing particle velocity \"v\", but after a minimum, it increases again. A minimum ionizing particle (or mip) is a particle whose mean energy loss rate through matter is close to the minimum. In many practical cases, relativistic particles (e.g., cosmic-ray muons) are minimum ionizing particles.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "174365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174365", "title": "Tree of the knowledge of good and evil", "text": "Tree of the knowledge of good and evil\n\nThe tree of the knowledge of good and evil (; ) is one of two specific trees in the story of the Garden of Eden in Genesis 2–3, along with the tree of life.\n\nGenesis 2 narrates that God places the first man and woman in a garden with trees of whose fruits they may eat, but forbids them to eat from \"the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\". When, in Genesis 3, a serpent seduces the woman to eat from its forbidden fruit and she also lets the man taste it, God expels them from the garden and thereby from eternal life.\n\nThe phrase in , literally translates as \"good and evil\". This may be an example of the type of figure of speech known as merism, a literary device that pairs opposite terms together in order to create a general meaning, so that the phrase \"good and evil\" would simply imply \"everything\". This is seen in the Egyptian expression \"evil-good\", which is normally employed to mean \"everything\". In Greek literature, Homer also uses the device when he lets Telemachus say, \"I know all things, the good and the evil\" (Od.20:309-10).\n\nIf \"tree of the knowledge of good and evil\" is to be understood to mean a tree whose fruit imparts knowledge of \"everything\", this phrase does not necessarily denote a moral concept. This view is held by several scholars.\n\nHowever, given the context of disobedience to God, other interpretations of the implications of this phrase also demand consideration. Robert Alter emphasizes the point that when God forbids the man to eat from that particular tree, he says that if he does so, he is \"doomed to die\". The Hebrew behind this is in a form regularly used in the Hebrew Bible for issuing death sentences.\n\nIn Jewish tradition, the Tree of Knowledge and the eating of its fruit represents the beginning of the mixture of good and evil together. Before that time, the two were separate, and evil had only a nebulous existence in potential. While free choice did exist before eating the fruit, evil existed as an entity separate from the human psyche, and it was not in human nature to desire it. Eating and internalizing the forbidden fruit changed this and thus was born the \"yeitzer hara\", the Evil Inclination. In Rashi's notes on Genesis 3:3, the first sin came about because Eve added an additional clause to the Divine command: \"Neither shall you touch it.\" By saying this, Eve added to YHWH's command and thereby came to detract from it, as it is written: \"Do not add to His Words\" (Proverbs 30:6). However, In \"Legends of the Jews\", it was Adam who had devoutly forbidden Eve to touch the tree even though God had only mentioned the eating of the fruit.\n\nIn Kabbalah, the sin of the Tree of Knowledge (called \"Cheit Eitz HaDa'at\") brought about the great task of \"beirurim\", sifting through the mixture of good and evil in the world to extract and liberate the sparks of holiness trapped therein. Since evil has no independent existence, it depends on holiness to draw down the Divine life-force, on whose \"leftovers\" it then feeds and derives existence. Once evil is separated from holiness through \"beirurim\", its source of life is cut off, causing the evil to disappear. This is accomplished through observance of the 613 commandments in the Torah, which deal primarily with physical objects wherein good and evil are mixed together. Thus, the task of \"beirurim\" rectifies the sin of the Tree and draws the Shechinah back down to earth, where the sin of the Tree had caused Her to depart.\n\nIn Christian theology, consuming the fruit of the \"tree of knowledge of good and evil\" was the sin committed by Adam and Eve that led to the fall of man in Genesis 2-3.\n\nIn Catholicism, Augustine of Hippo taught that the \"tree\" should be understood both symbolically and as a real tree - similarly to Jerusalem being both a real city and a figure of Heavenly Jerusalem. Augustine underlined that the fruits of that tree were not evil by themselves, because everything that God created \"was good\" (Gen 1:12). It was disobedience of Adam and Eve, who had been told by God not to eat of the tree (Gen 2:17), that caused disorder in the creation, thus humanity inherited sin and guilt from Adam and Eve's sin.\n\nIn Western Christian art, the fruit of the tree is commonly depicted as the apple, which originated in central Asia. This depiction may have originated as a Latin pun: by eating the \"mālum\" (apple), Eve contracted \"malum\" (evil). It is also possible that this depiction originated simply because of the religious painters' artistic licence.\n\nThe Quran never refers to the tree as the \"Tree of the knowledge of good and evil\" but rather typically refers to it as \"the tree\" or (in the words of Iblis) as the \"tree of immortality\". Muslims believe that when God created Adam and Eve, he told them that they could enjoy everything in the Garden except this tree, and so, Satan appeared to them and told them that the only reason God forbade them to eat from that tree is that they would become Angels or become immortals.\n\nWhen they ate from this tree their nakedness appeared to them and they began to sew together, for their covering, leaves from the Garden. The Quran mentions the sin as being a 'slip', and after this 'slip' they were sent to the destination they were intended to be on - Earth. Consequently, they repented to God and asked for his forgiveness and were forgiven. It was decided that those who obey God and follow his path shall be rewarded with everlasting life in \"Jannah\", and those who disobey God and stray away from his path shall be punished in \"Jahannam\".\n\nGod in Quran (Al-A'raf 27) states:\n\"[O] Children of Adam! Let not Satan tempt you as he brought your parents out of the Garden, stripping them of their garments to show them their shameful parts. Surely he [Satan] sees you, he and his tribe, from where you see them not. We have made the Satans the friends of those who do not believe.\"\n\nA cylinder seal, known as the Adam and Eve cylinder seal, from post-Akkadian periods in Mesopotamia (c. 23rd-22nd century BCE), has been linked to the Adam and Eve story. Assyriologist George Smith (1840-1876) describes the seal as having two facing figures (male and female) seated on each side of a tree, holding out their hands to the fruit, while between their backs is a serpent, giving evidence that the fall of man account was known in early times of Babylonia.\nThe British Museum disputes this interpretation and holds that it is a common image from the period depicting a male deity being worshipped by a woman, with no reason to connect the scene with the Book of Genesis.\n\nThe Tamil poem \"Tala Vilasam\" recounts a legend of the tree that parallels the Biblical account. In it, the Creator Brahma finally allows the people access to the tree- which, in this case, is the palmyra palmtree Borassus flabellifer.\n\nAmerican ethnomycologist, ethnobotanist, and philosopher Terence McKenna proposed that the Forbidden Fruit was entheogenic, identifying it as the \"Psilocybe cubensis\" mushroom, consistent with his \"Stoned Ape\" model of human evolution.\n\n"}

Sturgis (February 25, 1782 – October 21, 1863) was a Boston merchant in the China trade, the California hide trade and the Maritime fur trade.\n\nSturgis was born in Barnstable, Massachusetts, to Hannah Mills and William E. Sturgis, a ship master and lineal descendant from Edward Sturgis of Yarmouth, Massachusetts, the first Sturgis in America (arrived 1630).\n\nIn 1796, he joined the counting house of his uncle Russell Sturgis (1750–1826), and less than two years later became connected with James and Thomas Handasyd Perkins's maritime fur trade between the Pacific Northwest coast and China.\n\nUpon his father's death in 1797, he went to sea to support the family as assistant trader on the \"Eliza\", then as chief mate of the \"Ulysses\". He then served under Captain Charles Derby on the \"Caroline\" until Derby died and Sturgis took command. In 1804 the \"Caroline\" sailed from the Columbia River to Kaigahnee, just south of Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, acquiring some 2,500 sea otter skins that netted $73,034.\n\nIn 1809, his ship the \"Atahualpa\", owned by Theodore Lyman, was attacked by Chinese pirates while moored at Macau Roads. Sturgis managed to get the ship underway and fought off the pirates using four small cannons he had brought on board against the wishes of the ship's owner. Using these, they managed to fight long enough to sail within range of the protective guns of the harbor, and the pirates were captured, their commander Apootsae later being tortured to death by the Mandarin authorities. Sturgis had been prepared to blow up the ship if the pirates caught them in order to save the crew and passengers from being tortured. Lyman reportedly chastised Sturgis for having violated his instructions by bringing the cannon on the voyage.\n\nIn 1810, he returned to Boston formed a trading partnership with John Bryant as Bryant & Sturgis. \n\nFrom 1810 to 1850 more than half of the trade carried on between the Pacific Northwest coast and China was under their direction, including substantial parts of the California hide trade.\n\nOn his return to Boston in 1810 he married Elizabeth M. Davis, with whom he had one son and five daughters. One daughter, Ellen Sturgis Hooper, was a Transcendentalist poet and was the mother of Marian Hooper Adams. \nSturgis was a longtime member of the Massachusetts House and Senate, a member and sometime president of the Boston Marine Society, and a member of the Massachusetts Historical Society.\n\nSturgis donated his childhood home to be the Barnstable public library, now called the Sturgis Library, and his papers are collected there. Bryant & Sturgis business records are preserved at the Bryant Library of the Harvard Business School.\n\nA Sturgis descendant donated the Tanglewood estate to the Boston Symphony Orchestra. There is a Sturgis Charter Public School, an IB For all 9-12 school in Hyannis, MA.\nThe \"William Sturgis\" of Boston was an 1849 ship of 649½ tons, built by James O. Curtis in Medford, MA for William F. Weld & Co. She sailed from Cardiff to Iloilo with a cargo of coal. On Sept. 19, 1863, she was off the coast of Guimaras.

{"id": "2844695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2844695", "title": "YIMBY", "text": "YIMBY\n\nYIMBY is an acronym for \"Yes In My Back Yard,\" a pro-development movement in contrast and opposition to the NIMBY phenomenon. Typically the YIMBY movement supports development of new housing in cities where rental costs have escalated to unaffordable levels, though it may also support public-interest projects such as the installation of clean energy sources like wind turbines.\n\nPeople who identify as YIMBY come from all over the political spectrum, from far left-wingers who believe in social justice, to free-market libertarians who feel that the supply of housing should not be regulated by the government (see Market urbanist); together they agree on the principle that cities should be affordable and accessible for everyone, and the way to accomplish that is by building more housing.\n\nIn Toronto, Canada, a self-styled YIMBY movement was established in 2006 by community members in response to significant development proposals in the area, and a YIMBY festival, launched the same year, has been held annually since. The festival's organizer, Christina Zeidler, states that YIMBYism is a community mindset that’s open to change and development.\n\nYimby is an independent political party network founded in Stockholm in 2007, which advocates physical development, densification and promotion of urban environment. There are chapters in Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Uppsala. The group believes that the PBL (Plans and Constructions Act, from 1987) is a major impediment to any new construction, and should eliminated or dramatically reformed.\n\nSince 2014, in response to California's housing affordability crisis, several YIMBY groups have sprung up in the San Francisco Bay Area, including the San Francisco Bay Area Renters' Federation, headed by Sonja Trauss, as well as YIMBY Action, East Bay for Everyone, Palo Alto Forward, Catalyze SV, and CaRLA. These groups lobby both locally and at the state level for increased housing production at all price levels, as well as using California's Housing Accountability Act (\"the anti-NIMBY law\") to sue cities when they attempt to block, restrict, or down-size housing development. As \"The New York Times\" explains about Trauss' organization: \"Its platform is simple: Members want San Francisco and its suburbs to build more of every kind of housing. More subsidized affordable housing, more market-rate rentals, more high-end condominiums.\"\nIn 2018, a newly-formed group named California YIMBY, which received $100,000 from Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman, as well as $1 million from San Francisco tech company Stripe, lobbied for and joined over 100 Bay Area tech executives in supporting state senator Scott Wiener's California Senate Bill 827, which would have required cities to permit higher density housing near public transit stops, as well as eliminated minimum parking requirements for those developments. \n\nSince 2012, several YIMBY groups have sprouted in the greater Boston area, including A Better Cambridge, started by Jesse Kanson-Benanav, as well as Walk Up Roslindale and Villages Newton. Kanson-Benanav's group argues that:...more smart housing development is the only way to retain a middle class in pricey cities like Boston and Cambridge.\n\nNikolai Fedak is one of the early leaders in New York, (since 2011) and the first YIMBY news website focuses on construction trends in New York City. In an interview with \"Politico\", he stated that: “Zoning is the problem, not development in this city. I think people don’t really understand that,” he said.\n\nIn September 2018, the third annual Yes In My Backyard conference, named \"YIMBYTown\" will occur in Boston, hosted by that area's YIMBY community. The first YIMBY conference was held in 2016 in Boulder, Colorado and hosted by a group that included Boulder's former mayor, Will Toor, who commented that: It is clearer than ever that if we really care about solving big national issues like inequality and climate change, tackling the lack of housing in thriving urban areas, caused largely by local zoning restrictions, is key. The second annual conference was held in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Oakland, California. These conferences have attracted attendees from the United States, as well as some from Canada, England, Australia, and other countries.\n\n\n\n"}
