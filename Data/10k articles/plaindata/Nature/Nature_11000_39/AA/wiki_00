The reflected wave interferes with incident wave and produces a standing wave along the TL, this changes the amplitude of wave along the TL.

{"id": "20494183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20494183", "title": "Avulsion (river)", "text": "Avulsion (river)\n\nIn sedimentary geology and fluvial geomorphology, avulsion is the rapid abandonment of a river channel and the formation of a new river channel. Avulsions occur as a result of channel slopes that are much less steep than the slope that the river could travel if it took a new course.\n\nAvulsions are common in river deltas, where sediment deposits as the river enters the ocean and channel gradients are typically very small. This process is also known as delta switching.\n\nDeposition from the river results in the formation of an individual deltaic lobe that pushes out into the sea. An example of a deltaic lobe is the bird's-foot delta of the Mississippi River, pictured at right with its sediment plumes. As the deltaic lobe advances, the slope of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope or gradient). As the slope of the river channel decreases, it becomes unstable for two reasons. First, water under the force of gravity will tend to flow in the most direct course downslope. If the river could breach its natural levees (i.e., during a flood), it would spill out onto a new course with a shorter route to the ocean, thereby obtaining a more stable steeper slope. Second, as its slope is reduced, the amount of shear stress on the bed will decrease, resulting in deposition of more sediment within the channel and thus raising of the channel bed relative to the floodplain. This will make it easier for the river to breach its levees and cut a new channel that enters the ocean at a steeper slope.\n\nWhen this avulsion occurs, the new channel carries sediment out to the ocean, building a new deltaic lobe. The abandoned delta eventually subsides.\n\nThis process is also related to the distributary network of river channels that can be observed within a river delta. When the channel does this, some of its flow can remain in the abandoned channel. When these channel switching events happen repeatedly over time, a mature delta will gain a distributary network.\n\nSubsidence of the delta and/or sea-level rise can further cause backwater and deposition in the delta. This deposition fills the channels and leaves a geologic record of channel avulsion in sedimentary basins. On average, an avulsion will occur every time the bed of a river channel aggrades enough that the river channel is superelevated above the floodplain by one channel-depth. In this situation, enough hydraulic head is available that any breach of the natural levees will result in an avulsion.\n\nRivers can also avulse due to the erosion of a new channel that creates a straighter path through the landscape. This can happen during large floods in situations in which the slope of the new channel is significantly greater than that of the old channel. Where the new channel's slope is about the same as the old channel's slope, a \"partial avulsion\" will occur in which both channels are occupied by flow. An example of an erosional avulsion is the 2006 avulsion of the Suncook River in New Hampshire, in which heavy rains caused flow levels to rise. The river level backed up behind an old mill dam, which produced a shallowly-sloping pool that overtopped a sand and gravel quarry, connected with a downstream section of channel, and cut a new shorter channel at 25–50 meters per hour. Sediment mobilised by this erosional avulsion produced a depositionally-forced meander cutoff further downstream by superelevating the bed around the meander bend to nearly the level of the floodplain.\n\nAn example of a minor avulsion is known as a meander cutoff, where the high-sinuosity meander bend is abandoned in favour of the high-slope (i.e Large bending meander has river cut through a straighter course, and the meander has water drain away) This occurs when the ratio between the channel slope and the potential slope after an avulsion is less than about 1/5.\n\nAvulsion typically occurs during large floods which carry the power necessary to rapidly change the landscape. Dam removal could also lead to avulsion.\n\nAvulsions usually occur as a downstream to upstream process via head cutting erosion. If a bank of a current stream is breached a new trench will be cut into the existing floodplain. It either cuts through floodplain deposits or reoccupies an old channel.\n\nAvulsions have been investigated in the deltas or coastal plain channels as a result of obstructions such as log-jams and possible tectonic influences.\n\n"}

{"id": "26127259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26127259", "title": "Boring Billion", "text": "Boring Billion\n\nThe Boring Billion is a term coined by palaeontologist Martin Brasier to refer to the approximately one billion-year period between 1.8 and 0.8 Ga in Earth's history that is characterized by environmental, evolutionary, and lithospheric stability. It has also been termed the \"Barren Billion\", \"Dullest Time on Earth\" and \"Earth’s Middle Ages\".\n\nIn the time leading up to the Boring Billion, Earth experienced multiple widespread glaciations, the origin of prokaryotic life, the introduction of oxygen into the atmosphere with the evolution of cyanobacteria, addition of UV-blocking ozone to the atmosphere, and the oxidizing of iron in the oceans. After the Boring Billion, the atmosphere again underwent rapid changes as atmospheric oxygen rose to approximately modern levels, most major animal phyla evolved during the Cambrian explosion, and large animals appeared in the oceans.\n\nBy contrast, the period of the Boring Billion was characterized by climatic stability, low levels of atmospheric oxygen, lack of biological events, and the absence of extreme changes in the atmospheric and oceanic composition. Stability during the Boring Billion may be attributed to a relatively stable supercontinent that was initiated by 1.7 Ga and persisted until its breakup around 0.75 Ga. The exact timing and duration of the Boring Billion is not agreed upon by scientists and estimates for the beginning and end of the Boring Billion range between 1.8 and 2.4 Ga for initiation and between 0.5 and 0.8 Ga for termination. The Boring Billion occurred during the Proterozoic Eon.\n\nDuring the Boring Billion, green and purple photosynthetic bacteria appear to have thrived in an anoxic and sulfidic ocean. This ocean was much less productive than modern oceans, released sulfurous gasses including toxic hydrogen sulfide, and was very limited in nutrients (especially Mo, Fe, N, and P). As the Boring Billion progressed, eukaryotic life evolved from an Archean ancestor within this ocean. By the end of the Boring Billion, the first life had appeared on land. Eukaryotes, specifically a proto-lichen, helped end the Boring Billion by causing Earth’s second oxygenation event and the Snowball Earth glaciation that accompanied it.\n\nDespite the \"boring\" label, when plate tectonics, environmental conditions, and the evolution of eukaryotic life are considered, much was happening during this period.\n\nRecent scientific studies on the Boring Billion have found little evidence of significant climatic variability during this time period. Different theories have been developed by individual scientists to explain the inferred climatic stability, while others attribute the lack of evidence to an absence of suitable records. There is currently no generally accepted theory in the scientific community on the cause(s) of the climatic stability during the Boring Billion.\n\nThe evolution of Earth’s biosphere, atmosphere and hydrosphere has long been linked to the supercontinent cycle, through which the Earth’s continental crust undergoes a periodic cycle of aggregation and dispersal. The period of the Boring Billion is characterized by the evolution of two different supercontinents: Columbia and Rodinia. The supercontinent Columbia amalgamated between 2.0 and 1.7 Ga and remained as a quasi-integral continental lid until at least 1.3 Ga. Several breakup attempts were unsuccessful. Geological and paleomagnetic evidence suggest that Columbia underwent only minor changes to form the supercontinent Rodinia during the period from 1.1 to 0.9 Ga. Paleogeographic reconstructions suggest that the supercontinent assemblage was located in equatorial and temperate climate zones throughout the intervening time frame; there is little or no evidence for continental fragments in polar latitudes. A consequence of the limited breakup history is the lack of passive margins during the time period from 1.8 to 0.8 Ga. This stable configuration provides the primary constraint on the environmental stasis that characterizes the oceans, atmosphere, and biosphere. The breakup of Rodinia at approximately 0.75 Ga is considered the end of Earth’s Boring Billion. It should be noted that numerous reconstructions of Columbia’s paleogeography exist and consensus has yet to be reached. Evaluating the evidence of paleo poles and continent location becomes increasingly more difficult as deposits get older and relevant rock units show increasing levels of deformation and fragmentation.\n\nThe relative scarcity of passive margins during the Boring Billion, which are created during times of continental breakup, is proposed to support the presence of a stable continental configuration enabling environmental and climate stability during this time period. However, it is also stated in the literature that in spite of the amalgamation of the supercontinents Columbia and Rodinia, relatively stable climatological conditions during the Boring Billion are consistent with a balance between weathering intensity, mantle temperatures and solar insolation throughout much of this time period.\n\nA mechanism put forward to explain low tectonic variability is related to the temperature of the asthenosphere, which may have been too hot to sustain modern plate tectonics in the early stages of the Earth’s evolution. Instead of vigorous plate recycling at subduction zones, plates were linked together for billions of years until the mantle cooled off enough to further sustain plate motions and the subsequent formation of subduction zones. The onset of this component of plate tectonics may have been aided by the thickening of the crust that, once initiated, caused plate subduction to be anomalously strong. This process occurred around 750 Ma ago, when the crust reached a temperature low enough to initiate and sustain plate tectonics in general and subduction processes in particular.\n\nThe absence of glaciation could be linked to the intensity of cosmic ray flux, and it is believed that periods of glaciation may be linked to periods with low cosmic ray flux due fluctuations in solar wind variations. Another possible cause is the rate of star formation in the Milky Way. The reduced rate in star formation may be linked to diminished glaciations from 1 to 2 Ga.\n\nThe Boring Billion as a time period is unique in a sense that it seems to lack any significant periods of prolonged glaciations that can be observed in regular periodicity in other parts of Earth's geologic history.\n\nSome researchers believe, however, that the proposed lack of an ozone layer, as expected during periods of low concentrations of atmospheric oxygen, in combination with lower solar intensity during that time period should have precluded the absence of glaciation without an intense greenhouse effect.\n\nInstead, the absence of a glacial record may be a function of data infidelity rather than a real feature of geologic time. Evidence for this are old glacially cut channels, which were found in the Kimberley district of Western Australia that have been dated to 1.8 Ga.\n\nEarth's geologic record indicates two events associated with significant increases in oxygen levels on Earth, with one occurring between 2.4 and 2.1 Ga, known as the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE), and the second occurring an approximate 0.8 Ga.\n\nThe period of time between these two oxygenations is thought to have been characterized by low levels of atmospheric oxygen (O). Researchers postulate this widespread anoxia was far greater than the anoxic deep oceans seen today (less than 1% of deep ocean). The cause and extent of the oxidation events and the subsequent billion years in between are subject to active debate. Although it was previously believed that atmospheric oxygen levels increased gradually through this period, new research has suggested that after the GOE – in which O levels spiked over 1,000 fold – oxygen levels dropped significantly and remained low (with minor fluctuations) until the second oxygenation event around 0.8 Ga.\nThe Lomagundi Excursion Event is considered to be the most prominent carbon isotope event in Earth’s history and can provide evidence for this large increase and subsequent decline in O. For this event, a release of 10 to 20 times the current atmospheric oxygen is predicted based on levels found in the carbonate δ13C record around the time of the GOE. Suggestions in the literature point to a ‘precipitous’ drop after the Lomagundi Excursion. The extent to which the GOE served as a ‘Great’ oxygenation event, particularly in regards to marine environments, became a topic of discussion in the scientific community, leading Donald Canfield to develop the idea of a two billion year lag in oxygenation of the oceans. He also proposed that the ocean was characterized high levels of hydrogen sulfide during this time, creating a euxinic environment. His explanation has become known as the Canfield Ocean hypothesis. It is believed that the low and fluctuating oxygen levels that characterized the Boring Billion effectively stalled evolution of complex life for the extent of the Boring Billion. The hypothesis of a predominantly globally euxinic ocean, with low to no oxygen, supports the theory of stalled evolution of complex animals throughout the Boring Billion. Complexity is believed to have evolved at the onset of a second oxygenation event and subsequent oxygenation of the ocean between 600-800 Ba.\n\nDonald Canfield proposed a hypothesis to explain how life persisted in the ocean despite low levels of oxygen. It is believed that during the Boring Billion, the ocean’s surface contained low levels of oxygen as a byproduct of oxygenic photosynthesis from cyanobacteria. Due to increased oxygen levels in the atmosphere, chemical weathering of the continents oxidized the mineral pyrite and transported sulfate (SO) to the oceans. Through this process, the ocean became rich in sulfur, and the ocean became a two layer system, consisting of a surface layer, high in oxygen, and a bottom layer, high in sulfur and low in oxygen. Canfield proposed that at the boundary between the two layers, green sulfur bacteria and purple bacteria served to convert the sulfur to hydrogen sulfide (HS). This process of deep sea sulfide creation led to high amounts of pyrite formation during the Boring Billion, and allowed for the chemical events that enabled the evolution of animals.\n\nLike the Canfield Ocean model, the Johnston hypothesis serves as a potential explanation of causal factors for tempered oxygenic production. The model ultimately claims that sulfide driven anoxic photosynthesis via sulfidic prokaryotes helped sustain a long period of deep ocean anoxia, and more specifically, euxinia. This period ended with the exhaustion of sulfide resources, leading to the coupling of oxygenic production and carbon burial that is characteristic of today’s oceans.\n\nAt the first order, Johnson’s take on the Canfield model is to recognize that maintaining the anoxygenic conditions requisite for a billion years would be difficult: as organic matter sinks, it decays and consumes oxygen, a process which is exacerbated by anoxygenic photosynthesis. It has been hypothesized that an explanation for this discrepancy could be anoxygenic photosynthesis, a primary production pathway that does not involve oxygen production as a byproduct. In this case, the consumption of oxygen by respiration is not balanced by oxygen generation through primary production. A modern example of such a system is best exemplified in parts of the Black Sea.\nGaps in the evidence from ancient rocks have failed to explain the discrepancy between Earth’s atmospheric and oceanic oxygen levels. By tracing the movement of chromium isotopes from land to ocean, a process that is sensitive to atmospheric oxygen levels, the earliest signs of significant chromium oxidation have been found. This suggests levels of atmospheric oxygen to have significantly increased around 800 million years ago. Small amounts of oxygen can convert insoluble chromium, a constituent of the continental crust to a soluble form which is then transported to the ocean and deposited in ironstone. By studying the chromium isotope composition in ancient ironstones, measuring the ratio of heavier Cr (which is more sensitive to oxidation) to the lighter Cr, researchers can determine ancient oxygen levels. This research revealed very low oxygen levels during the Boring Billion, which are below 0.1% of present atmospheric levels.\n\nRather than iron oxidation involving iron (III), pyrite formation (FeS) involves the uptake of iron (II) during euxinic conditions. A research team from the University of Tasmania, under the geologist Ross Large, measured levels of pyrite in ancient seafloor rocks to show that after the initial burst of oxygen 2.4–2.1 Ga there was a decline in oxygen levels until the second oxidation event around 800–600 Ma.\n\nIn comparison to the great increase in diversity during the Cambrian explosion, the evolution of life during the Boring Billion was relatively slow. However, this period did see the occurrence of several major events in the history of evolution, specifically the development of eukaryotic cells, the evolution of multicellularity and the evolution of sexual reproduction. Several steps were required in the evolution of eukaryotes from a prokaryotic ancestor including a reorganization of DNA within cells and the acquisition of organelles.\n\nThe first eukaryotes originated sometime between 2.3 and 1.1 billion years ago, around the beginning of the Boring Billion. The precise onset of eukaryotic evolution is hard to determine, but evidence for the presence of eukaryotic cells during this period can be found in the fossil record and molecular fossils. After eukaryotic cells evolved, multicellularity appeared. By 1.8 Ga the first living things on planet Earth that were big enough to see with the naked eye had appeared. By the end of the Boring Billion, multicellular algae, fungi, and animals inhabited Earth. Almost all of this life was restricted to Earth's oceans, but near the end of the Boring Billion the first terrestrial life, a proto-lichen, colonized land.\n\nThere is no agreed upon theory for the evolutionary steps that led to the appearance of the first eukaryotes, including the origin of the nucleus, cytoskeleton, and organelles that distinguish eukaryotes from prokaryotes (See \"Hypotheses for the origin of eukaryotes\" within the Eukaryote page). There are several changes that must have occurred as eukaryotic life evolved: an increase in genetic complexity, the development of an advanced cytoskeleton, a loss of the rigid bacterial outer wall, and the acquisition of membrane-bound organelles within cells.\n\nEukaryotic cells are generally much more complex than prokaryotic cells. When eukaryotic life evolved, an increase in genetic material was necessary to enable this complexity. With an increase in the amount of genetic material inside cells as eukaryotes were evolving, the evolution of entirely new structures and mechanisms of gene copying was required, leading to the development of the eukaryotic cell cycle.\n\nHistones likely appeared during the Boring Billion to help organize the increasing amount of DNA in ancestral eukaryotic cells. DNA was packed by histones into the first chromosomes. A system of more rapid eukaryotic DNA replication in which DNA was replicated from multiple replication origins was developed so that cells containing much more genetic material would still be able to reproduce quickly.\n\nThe development of an advanced cytoskeleton was necessary to organize the chromosomes during asexual cell replication. After the loss of the rigid bacterial outer wall, the advanced cytoskeleton allowed the cells to flow and move. The loss of the rigid bacterial cell wall, which helped prevent water from entering the cell and diluting the cytoplasm, required ancestral eukaryotes to develop pumping mechanisms to counteract osmosis. Once the advanced cytoskeleton was in place and cell wall removed, ancestral eukaryotic cells had the ability to flow around and engulf other cells using the process of phagocytosis, which is a more efficient way of obtaining nutrients than the system of external absorption used by prokaryotes.\n\nThe ability to ingest other cells enabled ancestral eukaryotes to build a much more complex cell. Once the capacity for consuming other cells was in place, early eukaryotes began to acquire internal membrane-bound organelles that included organelles that were once free-living prokaryotes. Based on phylogenetic and structural evidence, it is generally accepted that mitochondria were originally derived from a free-living a-proteobacterium. The bacterium was engulfed by an ancient cell, likely an Archaea, and entered into the first endosymbiotic relationship with its new host.\n\nMost models have explained the origin of the endosymbiosis in terms of the advantage gained by the host cell due to the greater energy production available through aerobic respiration (32 net ATP vs. 2 net for glycolysis). However, this hypothesis has several limitations. No known organism exports ATP to its environment, making it unlikely that a bacterium would begin doing so to its host. In addition, some eukaryotes possess mitochondria-derived organelles called hydrogenosomes which perform a type of anaerobic respiration, suggesting an adaptation to an anoxic environment. An alternative explanation known as the Hydrogen Hypothesis suggests that the unique conditions of the Canfield Ocean may have exerted a positive selective pressure on mitochondria for reasons unrelated to aerobic respiration. According to the Hydrogen Hypothesis, the original endosymbiotic event was between a hydrogen-producing bacterium and a hydrogen-consuming archaeon. This symbiosis would have been advantageous in the anoxic conditions in the deeper reaches of the oceans at that time and would explain the widespread phylogenetic distribution of anaerobic respiration genes among eukaryotes. One other hypothesis is that a sulfur-metabolizing archaea and the ancestor of mitochondria lived in proximity, each feeding on the other's waste products and deriving energy through the recycling of sulfur. When environmental conditions became harsh for one partner, the energy generation and recycling system became internalized and the archaeon and ancestral mitochondria fused to form one organism.\n\nChloroplasts are also considered endosymbionts and were likely acquired during the Boring Billion in the same manner as mitochondria. It is generally accepted that chloroplasts are descendants of a free-living oxygen-producing cyanobacteria.\n\nWhile it is unknown how the first eukaryotes evolved, they first appear in the fossil record by 1.85 Ga.\n\nAcritarchs, whose name means ‘uncertain origin’, are tiny, roughly spherical fossils present from before 2 billion years ago and throughout the Boring Billion that cannot be convincingly assigned to any particular part of the tree of life. One interpretation of acritarchs is that they represent the resting stage, or cysts, of eukaryotic algae. However, since bacteria are also known to cysts and spores, a prokaryote origin can’t be ruled out. It is generally agreed by experts on fossil life that acritarchs from about 1.85 Ga and later represent eukaryotes.\n\nLarger two centimeter, 2.1 billion year old spiral fossils found in a mine in Michigan are grouped into the Grypania, a grouping of spiral fossils previously thought to have arisen 1.4–1.6 billion years ago. Traces of internal detail confirm that the younger Grypania fossils are eukaryotes, but the older spirals lack fine detail and may have been made by filaments of prokaryote cells. The older fossils were possibly also incorrectly dated and have a more accurate age of 1.8–1.9 billion years.\n\nSteranes, the traces of sterols used in construction of the membranes of eukaryotes, have been found in 2.7 billion year old shales, and are evidence that eukaryotes, or at least their metabolic ancestors, were present at that time. While the sterols found in these shales are not made by any known modern bacteria, some bacteria are capable of producing sterols. Therefore, sterane presence is not definite evidence of eukaryotic cells.\n\nAfter the first eukaryotes appeared, the diversification and evolution of eukaryotes proceeded slowly. Environmental conditions, especially the presence of toxic sulfide, lack of oxygen in ocean water, lack of key nutrients and trace metals in ocean water, and/or little tectonic activity, contributed to slow eukaryotic evolution. Low oxygen levels in ocean water during the Boring Billion may have kept eukaryotes in low numbers and prevented the evolution of large energy hungry, fast moving animals that evolved at the end of the Boring Billion, though it has been argued that even with very little oxygen, animals could have emerged and persevered. It is also known that diversification of eukaryotes began well before the onset of global oxygenation of the oceans, leading to the conclusion that anoxic conditions could not be the only cause of slow eukaryotic evolution.\n\nThe anoxic and euxinic conditions of the period would also have affected the abundance of certain nutrients and trace metals in the environment. Both anoxic and sulfidic conditions lead to decreased solubility of iron, while sulfidic conditions lead to increased precipitation of the trace metal molybdenum. Both of these metals are essential for the utilization of nitrogen, as they are necessary for the enzymes nitrate reductase, which reduced nitrate and nitrite to ammonia, and nitrogenase, which reduces atmospheric nitrogen to nitrate. As such, life in the Proterozoic would have suffered from a lack of nitrogen, a situation which would have competitively favored prokaryotes over eukaryotes and likely negatively affected eukaryotic evolution.\n\nDespite these environmental constraints, eukaryotes developed multicellularity during the Boring Billion and a major diversification of eukaryotes occurred at the supergroup level between 1.9 and 0.75 Ga. Key biological innovations such as cell differentiation, sexual reproduction, and eukaryotic photosynthesis separated eukaryotes into animals, algae, and fungi.\n\nThe evolution of cell polarity, which allows cells to send a molecular message to one side of the cell but not the other and to interact with nearby cells, allowed the development of organized multicellularity during the Boring Billion. Qingshania, a small spiral coil that appears in the fossil record 1.7 Ga, is the oldest known fossil multicellular eukaryote.\n\nThe much larger eukaryotic genome with its rapid copying gave eukaryotes the capacity to create many different types of cells and assemble them together into large, complex, multicellular life. By 1.2 Ga, meiosis and sexual reproduction are present in single-celled eukaryotes. \"Bangiomorpha pubescens,\" a fossil multicellular red algae from the 1.2 Ga Hunting Formation, is the first known sexually reproducing organism. Fossils show differential spore/gamete formation, which is also evidence of cellular differentiation.\n\nThe first algae split from ancestral eukaryotes about 1.4 Ga. Molecular clock evidence suggests that red and green algae had separated by 1.2-0.9 Ga.\n\nFrom molecular clock dating of DNA and fossil evidence, the divergence of animals and fungi occurred between 1.2 and 1.9 billion years ago. 1.43 Ga fossils named \"Tappania\" may represent the first fungi. These 0.1 mm fossils of branching irregular cells have an obvious cytoskeleton and bulbous protrusions that suggest vegetative reproduction by budding. \"Tappania\" fossils dated near the end of the Boring Billion 0.9-0.8 billion years ago show definite multi-cellularity and differentiation. Some branches that extend from cells appear to re-fuse together, forming net-like patterns. This is a characteristic of fungi, whose hair-like hyphae extending from their cells sometimes fuse in this manner.\n\nPlants do not appear on land until 0.47 Ga, but around the end of the Boring Billion (0.7–0.9 Ga) land was beginning to be colonized by cyanobacteria and proto-lichens.\n\nProto-lichens were symbionts between fungi and algae and left evidence of biological weathering of continental rock in the Doushantuo phosphorite formation (0.6 Ga) and in laterites, Earth's first soils. Additional evidence for life on land is the characteristic carbon isotope signature of photosynthesis that is recorded in rock crusts and ancient soils from the end of the Boring Billion. Terrestrial microfossils and microbial mats of cyanobacteria have also been preserved. Some microbial communities lived under rock surfaces, others bound sand together, and some sat atop soils.\n\n"}

Moreover, let the surface \"S\" enclosing the volume formula_8 consist of a part formula_31 covered by \"n\" electrodes and an uncovered part formula_32.\n\nAccording to the above definitions and boundary conditions, and to the superposition theorem, the second equation can be split into the contributions\n\nrelative to the carriers and to the electrode voltages, respectively, formula_35 being the total number of carriers in the space, inside and outside formula_8, at time \"t\", formula_37 and formula_38. \nThe integrals of the above equations account for the displacement current, in particular across formula_32.\n\nOne of the more meaningful application of the above equations is to compute the current\n\nthrough an \"h\"th electrode of interest corresponding to the surface formula_41, formula_42 and formula_43 being the current due to the carriers and to the electrode voltages, to be computed through third and fourth equations, respectively.\n\nLet us consider as a first example, the case of a surface \"S\" that is not completely covered by electrodes, i.e., formula_44, and let us choose Dirichlet boundary conditions formula_45 on the \"h\"th electrode of interest and of formula_46 on the other electrodes so that, from the above equations we have\n\nwhere formula_49 is relative to the above-mentioned boundary conditions and formula_50 is a capacitive coefficient of the \"h\"th electrode given by\n\nformula_52 is the voltage difference between the \"h\"th electrode and an electrode held to a constant voltage (DC), for instance, directly connected to ground or through a DC voltage source. The above equations hold true for the above Dirichlet conditions for formula_53 and for any other choice of boundary conditions on formula_32.\n\nA second case can be that in which formula_46 also on formula_32 so that such equations reduce to\n\nAs a third case, exploiting also to the arbitrariness of formula_32 , we can choose a Neumann boundary condition of formula_60 tangent to formula_32 in any point. Then the equations become\n\nIn particular, this case is useful when the device is a right parallelepiped, being formula_32 and formula_65 the lateral surface and the bases, respectively.\n\nAs a fourth application let us assume formula_66 in the whole the volume formula_8, i.e., formula_68 in it, so that from the first equation of Section 1 we have\n\nwhich recover the Kirchhoff law with the inclusion the displacement current across the surface formula_32 that is not covered by electrodes.\n\nA fifth case, historically significant, is that of electrodes that completely enclose the volume formula_8 of the device, i.e. formula_72 . Indeed, choosing again the Dirichlet boundary conditions of formula_73 on formula_74 and formula_46 on the other electrodes, from the equations for the open device we get the relationships\n\nwith\n\nthus obtaining the Ramo-Shockly theorem as a particular application of the electrokinematics theorem, extended from the vacuum devices to any electrical component and material.\n\nAs the above relationships hold true also when formula_78 depends on time, we can have a sixty application if we select as formula_79 the electric field generated by the electrode voltages when there is no charge in formula_8. Indeed, as the first equation can be written in the form\n\nfrom which we have\n\nwhere formula_83 corresponds to the power entering the device formula_8 across the electrodes (enclosing it). On the other side\n\ngives the increment of the internal energy formula_86 in formula_8 in a unit of time, formula_88 being the total electric field of which formula_89 is due the electrodes and formula_90 is due to the whole charge density in formula_8 with formula_92 over \"S\". Then it is formula_93, so that, according to such equations, we also verify the energy balance formula_94 by means of the electrokinematics theorem. With the above relationships the balance can be extended also to the open devices by taking into account the displacement current across formula_32.\n\nA meaningful application of the above results is also the computation of the fluctuations of the current formula_96 when the electrode voltages is constant, because this is useful for the evaluation of the device noise. To this end, we can exploit the first equation of section Open devices, because it concerns the more general case of an open device and it can be reduced to a more simply relationship. This happens for frequencies formula_97, (formula_98 being the transit time of the \"j\"th carrier across the device) because the in time integral of the above equation of the Fourier transform to be performed to compute the power spectral density (PSD) of the noise, the time derivatives provides no contribution. Indeed, according to the Fourier transform, this result derives from integrals such as formula_99 , in which formula_100. Therefore, for the PSD computation we can exploit the relationships\n\nMoreover, as it can be shown, this happens also for formula_102, for instance when the \"j\"th carrier is stored for a long time formula_103 in a trap if the screening length due to the other carriers is small in comparison to \"formula_8\" size. All the above considerations hold true for any size of \"formula_8\", including nanodevices.\nIn particular we have a meaningful case when the device is a right parallelepiped or cylinder with formula_32 as lateral surface and \"u\" as the unit vector along its axis, with the bases formula_107 and formula_108 located at a distance \"L\" as electrodes, and with formula_109. Indeed, choosing formula_110, from the above equation we finally obtain the current formula_111,\n\nwhere formula_113 and formula_114 are the components of formula_115 and formula_4 along formula_117. The above equations in their corpuscular form are particularly suitable for the investigation of transport and noise phenomena from the microscopic point of view, with the application of both the analytical approaches and numerical statistical methods, such as the Monte Carlo techniques. On the other side, in their collective form of the last terms, they are useful to connect, with a general and new method, the local variations of continuous quantities to the current fluctuation at the device terminals. This will be shown in the next sections.\n\nLet us first evaluate the PSD formula_118 of the shot noise of the current formula_119 for short circuited device terminals, i.e. when the formula_52's are constant, by applying the third member of the first equation of the above Section. To this end, let us exploit the Fourier coefficient\n\nand the relationship\n\nwhere formula_123, formula_124 in the second term and formula_125 in the third. If we define with formula_126 and formula_127 the beginning and the end of the jth carrier motion inside formula_8, we have either formula_129 and formula_130 or vice versa (the case of formula_131 give no contribution), so that from the first equations of the above and of this Section, we get\n\nwhere formula_133 is the number of the carriers (with equal charge \"q\") that start from (arrive on) the electrode of interest during the time interval formula_134. Finally for formula_135, formula_136 being the correlation time, and for carriers with a motion that is statistically independent and a Poisson process we have formula_137, formula_138 and formula_139 so that we obtain\n\nwhere formula_141 is the average current due to the carriers leaving (reaching) the electrode. Therefore, we recover and extend the Schottky's theorem on shot noise. For instance for an ideal pn junction, or Schottky barrier diode, it is formula_142, formula_143, where formula_144 is the Boltzmann constant, \"T\" the absolute temperature, \"v\" the voltage and formula_145 the total current. In particular, for formula_146 the conductance becomes formula_147 and the above equation gives\n\nthat is the thermal noise at thermal equilibrium given by the Nyquist theorem.\nIf the carrier motions are correlated, the above equation has to be changed to the form (for formula_149)\n\nwhere formula_151 is the so-called Fano factor that can be both less than 1 (for instance in the case of carrier generation-recombination in nonideal \"pn\" junctions), and greater than 1 (as in the negative resistance region of resonant-tunneling diode, as a result of the electron-electron interaction being enhanced by the particular shape of the density of states in the well.)\n\nOnce again from the corpuscular point of view, let us evaluate the thermal noise with the autocorrelation function formula_152 of formula_153 by means of the second term of the second equation of section Fluctuations, that for the short circuit condition formula_154 (i.e., at thermal equilibrium) which implies formula_155, becomes\n\nwhere \"m\" is the carrier effective mass and formula_157. As formula_158 and formula_159 are the carrier mobility and the conductance of the device, from the above equation and the Wiener-Khintchine theorem we recover the result\n\nobtained by Nyquist from the second principle of the thermodynamics, i.e. by means of a macroscopic approach.\n\nA significant example of application of the macroscopic point of view expressed by the third term of the second equation of section Fluctuations is represented by the g-r noise generated by the carrier trapping-detrapping processes in device defects. In the case of constant voltages and drift current density formula_161, that is by neglecting the above velocity fluctuations of thermal origin, from the mentioned equation we get\n\nin which formula_163 is the carrier density, and its steady state value is formula_164, formula_165 being the device cross-section surface; furthermore, we use the same symbols for both the time averaged and the instantaneous quantities. Let us first evaluate the fluctuations of the current \"i\", that from the above equation are\n\nwhere only the fluctuation terms are time dependent. The mobility fluctuations can be due to the motion or to the change of status of defects that we neglect here. Therefore, we ascribe the origin of g-r noise to the trapping-detrapping processes that contribute to formula_167 through the other two terms via the fluctuation of the electron number formula_168 in the energy level formula_169 of a single trap in the channel or in its neighborhood. Indeed, the charge fluctuation formula_170 in the trap generates variations of formula_163 and of formula_172. However, the variation formula_173 does not contribute to formula_167 because it is odd in the \"u\" direction, so that we get\n\nfrom which we obtain\n\nwhere the reduction of the integration volume from formula_8 to the much smaller one formula_178 around the defect is justified by the fact that the effects of formula_179 and formula_173 fade within a few multiples of a screening length, which can be small (of the order of nanometers in graphene); from Gauss's theorem, we obtain also formula_181 and the r.h.s. of the equation. In it the variation formula_182 occurs around the average value formula_183 given by the Fermi-Dirac factor formula_184, formula_185 being the Fermi level. The PSD formula_186 of the fluctuation formula_167 due to a single trap then becomes formula_188, where formula_189 is the Lorentzian PSD of the random telegraph signal formula_190 and formula_191 is the trap relaxation time. Therefore, for a density formula_192 of equal and uncorrelated defects we have a total PSD formula_193 of the g-r noise given by\n\nWhen the defects are not equal, for any distribution of formula_191 (except a sharply peaked one, as in the above case of g-r noise), and even for a very small number of traps with large formula_191, the total PSD formula_197 of \"i\", corresponding to the sum of the PSD formula_186 of all the formula_199 (statistically independent) traps of the device, becomes\n\nwhere formula_201 down to the frequency formula_202, formula_203 being the largest formula_191 and formula_205 a proper coefficient. In particular, for unipolar conducting materials (e.g., for electrons as carriers) it can be formula_206 and, for trap energy levels formula_207, from formula_208 we also have formula_209, so that from the above equation we obtain,\n\nwhere formula_211 is the total number of the carriers and formula_212 is a parameters that depends on the material, structure and technology of the device.\n\nThe shown electrokinetics theorem holds true in the 'quasi electrostatic' condition, that is when the vector potential can be neglected or, in other terms, when the squared maximum size of formula_213 is much smaller than the squared minimum wavelength of the electromagnetic field in the device. However it can be extended to the electromagnetic field in a general form. In this general case, by means of the displacement current across the surface formula_32 it is possible, for instance, to evaluate the electromagnetic field radiation from an antenna. It holds true also when the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability depend on the frequency. Moreover, the field formula_215 other than the electric field in 'quasi electrostatic' conditions, can be any other physical irrotational field.\n\nFinally, the electrokinetics theorem holds true in the classical mechanics limit, because it requires the simultaneous knowledge of the position and velocity of the carrier, that is, as a result of the uncertainty principle, when its wave function is essentially non null in a volume smaller than that of device. Such a limit can however be overcome computing the current density according to the quantum mechanical expression.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27070898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27070898", "title": "Energy policy of Pakistan", "text": "Energy policy of Pakistan\n\nThe energy policy of Pakistan is formulated and determined by the federal, provincial, and local institutional entities in Pakistan, which address the issues of energy production, distribution, and consumption of energy, such as gas mileage and petroleum standards. Energy policy requires the proper legislation, international treaties, subsidies and incentives to investment, guidelines for energy conservation, taxation and other public policy techniques.\n\nSeveral mandates and proposals have been called over the years to overlook the energy conservation, such as \"Neon signs were banned and the official weekend was extended from one to two days in an attempt to conserve electricity\" (Gillani, 2010) and \"reducing the electricity load used by industrial units by 25% during peak hours\" (Aziz, 2007), but no comprehensive long-term energy strategies were implemented. Since 1999, many legislative provisions were adopted for energy conservation including the seeking energy from various renewable energy sources. There is also an intense criticism about the unequal distribution of energy, the irresponsible usage of energy sources, and the country's new plan which is aimed to raise country's dependence on imported oil for power generation to 50% by 2030. After much public criticism, the long-term energy security policy was announced in 2013 through the introduction of equal cutting edge energy transmission network, minimising financial losses across the energy system and aligning the ministries involved in the energy sector as well as improving the governance of energy sources.\n\nStudies and policy implementation recommended by AEDB, Water ministry (as policy enforcer), the NEPRA regulates the energy sources network as well as determining the financial prices of the usage of energy. Government-specific energy-efficiency incentive programs also play a significant role in the overall energy policy of Pakistan. As of 2013 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has announced a determined and aggressive energy policy to meet the energy challenges and energy management.\n\n\nIn the 1960s, a large civilian energy input and infrastructure was built by the Pakistan military, with the financial funds provided by various countries and international monetary sources. In the 1960s, much of the energy was produced by the hydroelectric dams and thermal power stations. In the 1970s, Pakistan's energy consumption expanded to nuclear power sources with the establishment and commissioning of first nuclear power station in Karachi. In the 1980s, the dependence on nuclear sources further grew and the military continued engineering and building the nuclear power infrastructure.\n\nIn 1994, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) launched the country's first ever and largest energy conservation program to produce 13,000MW and issues 70 Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) and Letters of Intent (LOIs) to Independent Power Producers (IPPs). This 1994 energy policy brought a decisive shift in Pakistan's diverse energy sources. In 1994, out of the total installed capacity of 11000MW, ~60% of energy was produced from the hydroelectric power sources while nearly ~40% was produced from the thermal and nuclear sources. According to the economic statistics provided by economist, Sartaj Aziz, this mix was reversed from 60:40 to 30:70 in favour of thermal capacity based on imported fuel. Every year, this ratio went down further to 20:80 in winter months as hydropower generation was reduced due to lower water flows in the rivers.\n\nControversially, the energy policy depended less on renewable energy sources and dependence on imported oil increased that created a permanent fault in country's energy conservation system. By 1995, only 27 IPPs were able to generate ~6,335MW of electricity. By 1998, the ratio was stabilised by the policies enforced by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. In 2001, the military government led by President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, while contributing to the growth of domestic demand for electricity through large-scale provision of bank loans for the purchase of air-conditioners and home appliances (share of domestic energy consumption had jumped to 46% of the total by 2008), did not add any new capacity to the energy system. In 2012 Pakistan's first wind power installation came online at the FFCEL Wind Energy Project in Jhimpir.\n\nIn 2005, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz announced the long-term energy security program which was aimed to the development of the power infrastructure from all energy sources. This policy relied on privatising the energy sector by international mega energy corporations. Controversially, this program was aimed to raise dependence on imported oil from the Arab countries for power generation to be increased by 50.1% by 2013.\n\nIn 2006, Prime Minister Aziz held conversation with the officials of the Saudi Ministry of Petroleum and invited Ali Al-Naimi to invest in country's energy sector. In 2007, Prime Minister Aziz allocated ₨. 12.5 billion for power production-related projects which remained unused. In his last policy statement, Prime Minister Aziz further called for banning the Neon lights, Neon signs, and to close the market places by 9 pm; such policy enforcement was harshly resisted by the left-wing parties, such as Pakistan Peoples Party, Communist Party and the labour unions.\n\nAfter the general elections held in 2008, the mismanagement and weak policies led to an intense repetitive cycle of loadshedding in the country. Responding to a massive demonstration against the loadshedding and the growing power shortages in the country, Prime Minister, Yousaf Gilani announced the \"energy policy\" on 22 April 2010.\n\nThe policy was announced after the Prime Minister, Gilani had held a three-day national energy conference in Islamabad with energy experts that discussed the causes of the power crisis in Pakistan and possible steps to relieve it. On an immediate effects, the gaseous Neon lights and the signs were banned and the official weekend was extended from one to two days in an attempt to conserve electricity. Under this policy, several attempts were made by Gilani government to privatise the energy sector. Devised by the Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh, the programme failed to resolve electricity shortage, which private energy companies failed to maintain and upgrade despite being part of their contract. After much criticism and public demonstration in 2012, the PPP government decided to nationalised the energy sector and issued clear directives to regulate the energy corporations to produce the power generations.\n\nMusadik Masood Malik was appointed Federal Minister, Water and Power of the Pakistan Government in May, 2013. Within two months, he was replaced by Abid Sher Ali who served in the role until the ministry was abolished in September, 2017. In its place a Ministry of Energy was created. Awais Leghari served as the first energy minister of the country until the end of the government's tenure.\n\nThe 2010 amendment to Pakistan’s Constitution (para. 3), empowered each province to formulate the policy framework for the development of public and private sector power generation. This has led to the formation of dedicated provincial departments and empowered public sector companies specialized in renewables to foster and execute power projects through public, private and public–private partnership modes using indigenous power resources.\n\nThis tenure's energy policy was aimed at aggressively building power generation capacity through early-harvest projects in CPEC. A total of 10,973 MW of power was added by the government during its tenure, mostly via private sector investments. In terms of public sector projects conducted by provincial governments in view of the 2010 amendment, KPK government led with the addition of 1,670 MW to the national grid. It was followed by Sindh and Punjab governments which contributed 935 MW and 580 MW respectively. Balochistan government didn't inaugurate any public sector power project during its tenure.\n\nHowever, despite the massive addition of power to the national grid, glaring issues existed in the power sector. There was no viable overhaul done to the electricity transport infrastructure which lead to episodes of plant tripping and extended blackouts during the summer months. Furthermore, there was still a wide demand and supply gap during high temperature months which led to periodic, planned load-shedding. Finally, the issue of \"circular debt\" was still attached to the power sector and reached a record high of Rs. 922 billion in March, 2018.\n\nDue to rising demand and a failing power infrastructure severe electricity shortages have occurred in Pakistan. This has led to widespread rolling blackouts that have paralysed industry and led to protests and rioting. Power outages can last 6–8 hours a day in the cities and many more in the rural areas. According to Mahnaz Parach of Network for Consumer Protection \"Children can't do their homework. Housework doesn't get done, as washing machines and other appliances cannot work. When you go home from work, you have no idea whether there will be electricity at home. Your whole life is disturbed.\"\n\nExperts have warned of an impending energy crisis since 2006. Speaking at a Seminar 'Fueling the Future: Meeting Pakistan's Energy Needs in the 21st Century' held in Washington, D.C. in June 2006 then energy adviser to the prime minister of Pakistan Mukhtar Ahmed stated that the country was taking steps to address the energy shortage. Pakistan Electric Power Company estimates that there is a shortage of 6 gigawatts or about 60% of its total generation. One of the main reasons of the shortage is thought to be the failure of past governments to anticipate growth in need and the delay in implementation of projects to increase power production. In addition there is widespread power theft and lack of investment in the existing power grid.\n\nThe United States has made improving Pakistan's power infrastructure one of its top priorities. US special envoy Richard Holbrooke, while describing the power situation in Pakistan as \"unacceptable,\" has stated that the US would go to its \"absolute limits\" to help Pakistan overcome the crisis.\n\nMeasures are aimed at cutting consumption by 500 megawatts. The official weekend has been extended from one to two days. Neon signs and decorative lights have been banned. Power has been cut to government offices by 50% and air conditioners will only be allowed to be switched on after . Street markets have been asked to close early. Commercial centres except drug stores will be closed at and wedding celebrations will be limited to three hours. The government will pay off its debt to power producers allowing them to pay fuel suppliers. Power supply to Pakistan's commercial capital Karachi will be decreased by 300 megawatts to allow fairer distribution of power to the remaining parts of the country. Tube wells will not be allowed to operate from to . The measures will be reviewed on 30 July 2010.\n\nSince the early 1990s, the country has observed the highest growth rate in usage of computers that effect the supply of the electricity produced in the system. In a survey published by the \"Express Tribune\", around ~30 million citizens (out of 180 million), uses the internet on daily basis; the internet penetration in the country has reached 16% as of 2013.\n\nIn the days following the announcement, traders in Lahore rejected the government's decision and kept the markets open after in defiance of the ban. Shops were kept open in other cities also after . Kashif Shabbir, president of the Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce warned the situation would get worse if authorities used force to implement the decision. There was confusion over implementation of the two-day weekend, and many banks and educational institutions remained open. Commenting on the defiant mood of the traders, an editorial in \"Dawn\" urged everybody to find middle ground.\n\nReacting to the decision to curtail power supply to Karachi, the \"City of Lights\", leaders of various political parties in the Provincial Assembly of Sindh condemned the decision and some of them called it \"a conspiracy to create a law and order situation.\" Former Nazim of Karachi, Naimatullah Khan warned that curtailing the power supply of the city could lead to street battles between protesters and law enforcement.\n\nSome analysts have predicted that reduction in the banks' workweek to 5 days will result in revenue losses.\n\nThe prevailing energy crisis in Pakistan is taking away 2 percent (or Rs 380 billion) of the economy, despite the government has spent Rs 1.1 trillion as subsidies on the sector in the last four-year which accounts for 2.5 percent of the total volume of economy.\n\nDuring June 2012, President Asif Ali Zardari had said that the government realised the enormity of the challenge of energy shortage and was determined to overcome it in the shortest possible time.\n\nPakistan is already importing small quantity of electricity from Iran to supply power to Gwadar town. Pakistan is also actively considering to import electricity from India and Tajikistan. World Bank offered to finance for conducting the feasibility study to import 1200 MW power from India.\n\nPakistan is also exploring to import PNG via pipe line through Wagha border from India. India would import the required LNG and re-gasified LNG (RLNG) would be pumped through its pipelines up to the border point. Iran–Pakistan gas pipeline is pending for a long time to receive PNG from Iran for the needs of both Pakistan and India.\n\n\n"}

Carbon dioxide (CO) injected into a bituminous coal bed would occupy pore space and also adsorb onto the carbon in the coal at approximately twice\nthe rate of methane (CH), allowing for potential enhanced gas recovery. This technique may be used in conjunction with carbon capture and storage in mitigation of global warming where the carbon dioxide that is sequestered is captured from the output of fossil fuel power plants.\n\nA research project at ETH Zurich is studying the process of pumping carbon dioxide into unminable coal seams and recovering the methane that is subsequently displaced. \n\nAn extensive experimental investigation about the process of desorbing methane by adsorbing carbon dioxide in real coal samples was performed. The proof of principle and the technical feasibility of the method could be verified with these measurements. These research results indicate that CBM can become an alternative to conventional natural gas. ECBM provides additional to CBM the advantage of long-term CO2 storage in the underground coal seams.\n\nHowever, without other incentives, enhanced coal bed methane recovery is not economical as the commercial value of the released methane does not completely offset the cost of pumping.\n\nPenetration of CO into coal is simulated using a stress-enhanced diffusion model.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7484714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7484714", "title": "Forest management", "text": "Forest management\n\nForest management is a branch of forestry concerned with overall administrative, economic, legal, and social aspects, as well as scientific and technical aspects, such as silviculture, protection, and forest regulation. This includes management for aesthetics, fish, recreation, urban values, water, wilderness, wildlife, wood products, forest genetic resources, and other forest resource values. Management can be based on conservation, economics, or a mixture of the two. Techniques include timber extraction, planting and replanting of various species, cutting roads and pathways through forests, and preventing fire.\n\nThe forest is a natural system that can supply different products and services. The working of this system is influenced by the natural environment: climate, topography, soil, etc., and also by human activity. The actions of humans in forests constitute forest management. In developed societies, this management tends to be elaborate and planned in order to achieve the objectives that are considered desirable.\n\nSome forests have been and are managed to obtain traditional forest products such as firewood, fiber for paper, and timber, with little thinking for other products and services. Nevertheless, as a result of the progression of environmental awareness, management of forests for multiple use is becoming more common.\n\nThere has been increased public awareness of natural resource policy, including forest management. Public concern regarding forest management may have shifted from the extraction of timber for earning money for the economy, to the preservation of additional forest resources, including wildlife and old growth forest, protecting biodiversity, watershed management, and recreation. Increased environmental awareness may contribute to an increased public mistrust of forest management professionals. But it can also lead to greater understanding about what professionals do for forests for nature conservation and ecological services. The importance of taking care of the forests for ecological as well as economical sustainable reasons has been shown in the TV show Ax Men.\n\nMany tools like GIS and photogrammetry modelling have been developed to improve forest inventory and management planning. Since 1953, the volume of standing trees in the United States have increased by 90% due to sustainable forest management.\n\nThe abundance and diversity of birds, mammals, amphibians and other wildlife are affected by strategies and types of forest management.\n\nForest management varies in intensity from a leave alone, natural situation to a highly intensive regime with silvicultural interventions. Forest Management is generally increased in intensity to achieve either economic criteria (increased timber yields, non-timber forest products, ecosystem services) or ecological criteria (species recovery, fostering of rare species, carbon sequestration).\n\n"}

When these instruments are panned, the moving image appears to roll over a curved, convex surface. In 1949, Horst Koehler at Zeiss (Jena) suggested adding some pincushion distortion to the optical design to eliminate the globe effect. August Sonnefeld conducted experiments with volunteers, which supported the claim that a supplementary distortion could improve the imaging of visual optical instruments. Since that time, most binocular manufacturers have followed Zeiss's example and added pincushion distortion to their optical design.\n\nThe origin of the globe effect initially remained unclear after its discovery in the first half of the past century. Koehler speculated about an \"unnatural perspective generated by the binocular while panning over a three dimensional scenery\", thereby ignoring the fact that the globe effect was observable at the night sky as well, where perspective distortions were absent.\n\nRecently, the globe effect has been linked to the peculiar properties of human visual perception, which adds a certain amount of barrel distortion to the visual field. The amount of barrel distortion is subject to individual differences, which explains the fact that the perceived intensity of the globe effect varies significantly between different observers.\n\nAn alternative approach for explaining the globe effect comes from the technical journalist and optics specialist Walter E. Schön. He states that the observed effect is in fact not that of a rolling globe but that of a vertically rotating cylinder. The globe shape of the illusion seen by most observers is only because the field of view through the optical device is circular. This illusion of a rotating cylinder during panning is caused by the horizontal movement of the image being (due to the angular magnification of the device) faster and more uniform (with less parallax) compared to the naked eye and also not corresponding to the felt rotational speed of the observer's head. When the brain tries to integrate these conflicting signals, it creates the perception that the image is moving slower at the left and right edges than in the middle, giving the illusion of a rotating cylinder.\n\n"}

Nearly spherical dew droplets act as lenses to focus the light onto the surface behind them.

{"id": "15361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15361", "title": "Ice age", "text": "Ice age\n\nAn ice age is a long period of reduction in the temperature of the Earth's surface and atmosphere, resulting in the presence or expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers. Within a long-term ice age, individual pulses of cold climate are termed \"glacial periods\" (or, alternatively, \"glacials\" or \"glaciations\", or colloquially \"ice ages\"), and intermittent warm periods are called \"interglacials\". \n\nIn the terminology of glaciology, \"ice age\" implies the presence of extensive ice sheets in both northern and southern hemispheres. By this definition, we are in an interglacial period—the Holocene—of the current ice age. \n\nThe current ice age began 2.6 million years ago at the start of the Pleistocene epoch, and the Greenland, Arctic, and Antarctic ice sheets still exist.\n\nIn 1742, Pierre Martel (1706–1767), an engineer and geographer living in Geneva, visited the valley of Chamonix in the Alps of Savoy. Two years later he published an account of his journey. He reported that the inhabitants of that valley attributed the dispersal of erratic boulders to the glaciers, saying that they had once extended much farther. Later similar explanations were reported from other regions of the Alps. In 1815 the carpenter and chamois hunter Jean-Pierre Perraudin (1767–1858) explained erratic boulders in the Val de Bagnes in the Swiss canton of Valais as being due to glaciers previously extending further. An unknown woodcutter from Meiringen in the Bernese Oberland advocated a similar idea in a discussion with the Swiss-German geologist Jean de Charpentier (1786–1855) in 1834. Comparable explanations are also known from the Val de Ferret in the Valais and the Seeland in western Switzerland and in Goethe's scientific work. Such explanations could also be found in other parts of the world. When the Bavarian naturalist Ernst von Bibra (1806–1878) visited the Chilean Andes in 1849–1850, the natives attributed fossil moraines to the former action of glaciers.\n\nMeanwhile, European scholars had begun to wonder what had caused the dispersal of erratic material. From the middle of the 18th century, some discussed ice as a means of transport. The Swedish mining expert Daniel Tilas (1712–1772) was, in 1742, the first person to suggest drifting sea ice in order to explain the presence of erratic boulders in the Scandinavian and Baltic regions. In 1795, the Scottish philosopher and gentleman naturalist, James Hutton (1726–1797), explained erratic boulders in the Alps by the action of glaciers. Two decades later, in 1818, the Swedish botanist Göran Wahlenberg (1780–1851) published his theory of a glaciation of the Scandinavian peninsula. He regarded glaciation as a regional phenomenon.\nOnly a few years later, the Danish-Norwegian geologist Jens Esmark (1762–1839) argued a sequence of worldwide ice ages. In a paper published in 1824, Esmark proposed changes in climate as the cause of those glaciations. He attempted to show that they originated from changes in Earth's orbit. During the following years, Esmark's ideas were discussed and taken over in parts by Swedish, Scottish and German scientists. At the University of Edinburgh Robert Jameson (1774–1854) seemed to be relatively open to Esmark's ideas, as reviewed by Norwegian professor of glaciology Bjørn G. Andersen (1992). Jameson's remarks about ancient glaciers in Scotland were most probably prompted by Esmark. In Germany, Albrecht Reinhard Bernhardi (1797–1849), a geologist and professor of forestry at an academy in Dreissigacker, since incorporated in the southern Thuringian city of Meiningen, adopted Esmark's theory. In a paper published in 1832, Bernhardi speculated about former polar ice caps reaching as far as the temperate zones of the globe.\n\nIn 1829, independently of these debates, the Swiss civil engineer Ignaz Venetz (1788–1859) explained the dispersal of erratic boulders in the Alps, the nearby Jura Mountains, and the North German Plain as being due to huge glaciers. When he read his paper before the Schweizerische Naturforschende Gesellschaft, most scientists remained sceptical. Finally, Venetz convinced his friend Jean de Charpentier. De Charpentier transformed Venetz's idea into a theory with a glaciation limited to the Alps. His thoughts resembled Wahlenberg's theory. In fact, both men shared the same volcanistic, or in de Charpentier's case rather plutonistic assumptions, about the Earth's history. In 1834, de Charpentier presented his paper before the Schweizerische Naturforschende Gesellschaft. In the meantime, the German botanist Karl Friedrich Schimper (1803–1867) was studying mosses which were growing on erratic boulders in the alpine upland of Bavaria. He began to wonder where such masses of stone had come from. During the summer of 1835 he made some excursions to the Bavarian Alps. Schimper came to the conclusion that ice must have been the means of transport for the boulders in the alpine upland. In the winter of 1835 to 1836 he held some lectures in Munich. Schimper then assumed that there must have been global times of obliteration (\"Verödungszeiten\") with a cold climate and frozen water. Schimper spent the summer months of 1836 at Devens, near Bex, in the Swiss Alps with his former university friend Louis Agassiz (1801–1873) and Jean de Charpentier. Schimper, de Charpentier and possibly Venetz convinced Agassiz that there had been a time of glaciation. During the winter of 1836/37, Agassiz and Schimper developed the theory of a sequence of glaciations. They mainly drew upon the preceding works of Venetz, de Charpentier and on their own fieldwork. Agassiz appears to have been already familiar with Bernhardi's paper at that time. At the beginning of 1837, Schimper coined the term \"ice age\" (\"Eiszeit\") for the period of the glaciers. In July 1837 Agassiz presented their synthesis before the annual meeting of the Schweizerische Naturforschende Gesellschaft at Neuchâtel. The audience was very critical and some opposed to the new theory because it contradicted the established opinions on climatic history. Most contemporary scientists thought that the Earth had been gradually cooling down since its birth as a molten globe.\n\nIn order to overcome this rejection, Agassiz embarked on geological fieldwork. He published his book \"Study on Glaciers\" (\"Études sur les glaciers\") in 1840. De Charpentier was put out by this, as he had also been preparing a book about the glaciation of the Alps. De Charpentier felt that Agassiz should have given him precedence as it was he who had introduced Agassiz to in-depth glacial research. Besides that, Agassiz had, as a result of personal quarrels, omitted any mention of Schimper in his book.\n\nAll together, it took several decades until the ice age theory was fully accepted by scientists. This happened on an international scale in the second half of the 1870s following the work of James Croll, including the publication of \"Climate and Time, in Their Geological Relations\" in 1875, which provided a credible explanation for the causes of ice ages.\n\nThere are three main types of evidence for ice ages: geological, chemical, and paleontological.\n\nGeological evidence for ice ages comes in various forms, including rock scouring and scratching, glacial moraines, drumlins, valley cutting, and the deposition of till or tillites and glacial erratics. Successive glaciations tend to distort and erase the geological evidence, making it difficult to interpret. Furthermore, this evidence was difficult to date exactly; early theories assumed that the glacials were short compared to the long interglacials. The advent of sediment and ice cores revealed the true situation: glacials are long, interglacials short. It took some time for the current theory to be worked out.\n\nThe chemical evidence mainly consists of variations in the ratios of isotopes in fossils present in sediments and sedimentary rocks and ocean sediment cores. For the most recent glacial periods ice cores provide climate proxies from their ice, and atmospheric samples from included bubbles of air. Because water containing heavier isotopes has a higher heat of evaporation, its proportion decreases with colder conditions. This allows a temperature record to be constructed. This evidence can be confounded, however, by other factors recorded by isotope ratios.\n\nThe paleontological evidence consists of changes in the geographical distribution of fossils. During a glacial period cold-adapted organisms spread into lower latitudes, and organisms that prefer warmer conditions become extinct or are squeezed into lower latitudes. This evidence is also difficult to interpret because it requires (1) sequences of sediments covering a long period of time, over a wide range of latitudes and which are easily correlated; (2) ancient organisms which survive for several million years without change and whose temperature preferences are easily diagnosed; and (3) the finding of the relevant fossils.\n\nDespite the difficulties, analysis of ice core and ocean sediment cores has shown periods of glacials and interglacials over the past few million years. These also confirm the linkage between ice ages and continental crust phenomena such as glacial moraines, drumlins, and glacial erratics. Hence the continental crust phenomena are accepted as good evidence of earlier ice ages when they are found in layers created much earlier than the time range for which ice cores and ocean sediment cores are available.\n\nThere have been at least five major ice ages in the Earth's history (the Huronian, Cryogenian, Andean-Saharan, Karoo Ice Age, and the current Quaternary Ice Age). Outside these ages, the Earth seems to have been ice free even in high latitudes.\n\nRocks from the earliest well established ice age, called the Huronian, formed around 2.4 to 2.1 Ga (billion years) ago during the early Proterozoic Eon. Several hundreds of km of the Huronian Supergroup are exposed 10–100 km north of the north shore of Lake Huron extending from near Sault Ste. Marie to Sudbury, northeast of Lake Huron, with giant layers of now-lithified till beds, dropstones, varves, outwash, and scoured basement rocks. Correlative Huronian deposits have been found near Marquette, Michigan, and correlation has been made with Paleoproterozoic glacial deposits from Western Australia. The Huronian ice age was caused by the elimination of atmospheric methane, a greenhouse gas, during the Great Oxygenation Event.\n\nThe next well-documented ice age, and probably the most severe of the last billion years, occurred from 850 to 630 million years ago (the Cryogenian period) and may have produced a Snowball Earth in which glacial ice sheets reached the equator, possibly being ended by the accumulation of greenhouse gases such as produced by volcanoes. \"The presence of ice on the continents and pack ice on the oceans would inhibit both silicate weathering and photosynthesis, which are the two major sinks for at present.\" It has been suggested that the end of this ice age was responsible for the subsequent Ediacaran and Cambrian explosion, though this model is recent and controversial.\n\nThe Andean-Saharan occurred from 460 to 420 million years ago, during the Late Ordovician and the Silurian period.\n\nThe evolution of land plants at the onset of the Devonian period caused a long term increase in planetary oxygen levels and reduction of levels, which resulted in the Karoo Ice Age. It is named after the glacial tills found in the Karoo region of South Africa, where evidence for this ice age was first clearly identified. There were extensive polar ice caps at intervals from 360 to 260 million years ago in South Africa during the Carboniferous and early Permian Periods. Correlatives are known from Argentina, also in the center of the ancient supercontinent Gondwanaland.\n\nThe Quaternary Glaciation / Quaternary Ice Age started about 2.58 million years ago at the beginning of the Quaternary Period when the spread of ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere began. Since then, the world has seen cycles of glaciation with ice sheets advancing and retreating on 40,000- and 100,000-year time scales called glacial periods, glacials or glacial advances, and interglacial periods, interglacials or glacial retreats. The earth is currently in an interglacial, and the last glacial period ended about 10,000 years ago. All that remains of the continental ice sheets are the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and smaller glaciers such as on Baffin Island.\n\nThe definition of the Quaternary as beginning 2.58 Ma is based on the formation of the Arctic ice cap. The Antarctic ice sheet began to form earlier, at about 34 Ma, in the mid-Cenozoic (Eocene-Oligocene Boundary). The term Late Cenozoic Ice Age is used to include this early phase.\n\nIce ages can be further divided by location and time; for example, the names \"Riss\" (180,000–130,000 years bp) and \"Würm\" (70,000–10,000 years bp) refer specifically to glaciation in the Alpine region. The maximum extent of the ice is not maintained for the full interval. The scouring action of each glaciation tends to remove most of the evidence of prior ice sheets almost completely, except in regions where the later sheet does not achieve full coverage.\n\nWithin the ice ages (or at least within the current one), more temperate and more severe periods occur. The colder periods are called \"glacial periods\", the warmer periods \"interglacials\", such as the Eemian Stage.\n\nGlacials are characterized by cooler and drier climates over most of the earth and large land and sea ice masses extending outward from the poles. Mountain glaciers in otherwise unglaciated areas extend to lower elevations due to a lower snow line. Sea levels drop due to the removal of large volumes of water above sea level in the icecaps. There is evidence that ocean circulation patterns are disrupted by glaciations. Since the earth has significant continental glaciation in the Arctic and Antarctic, we are currently in a glacial minimum of a glaciation. Such a period between glacial maxima is known as an \"interglacial\". The glacials and interglacials also coincided with changes in Earth's orbit called Milankovitch cycles.\n\nThe earth has been in an interglacial period known as the Holocene for around 11,700 years, and an article in \"Nature\" in 2004 argues that it might be most analogous to a previous interglacial that lasted 28,000 years. Predicted changes in orbital forcing suggest that the next glacial period would begin at least 50,000 years from now, even in absence of human-made global warming (see Milankovitch cycles). Moreover, anthropogenic forcing from increased greenhouse gases might outweigh orbital forcing for as long as intensive use of fossil fuels continues.\n\nEach glacial period is subject to positive feedback which makes it more severe, and negative feedback which mitigates and (in all cases so far) eventually ends it.\n\nIce and snow increase Earth's albedo, i.e. they make it reflect more of the sun's energy and absorb less. Hence, when the air temperature decreases, ice and snow fields grow, and this continues until competition with a negative feedback mechanism forces the system to an equilibrium. Also, the reduction in forests caused by the ice's expansion increases albedo.\n\nAnother theory proposed by Ewing and Donn in 1956 hypothesized that an ice-free Arctic Ocean leads to increased snowfall at high latitudes. When low-temperature ice covers the Arctic Ocean there is little evaporation or sublimation and the polar regions are quite dry in terms of precipitation, comparable to the amount found in mid-latitude deserts. This low precipitation allows high-latitude snowfalls to melt during the summer. An ice-free Arctic Ocean absorbs solar radiation during the long summer days, and evaporates more water into the Arctic atmosphere. With higher precipitation, portions of this snow may not melt during the summer and so glacial ice can form at lower altitudes \"and\" more southerly latitudes, reducing the temperatures over land by increased albedo as noted above. Furthermore, under this hypothesis the lack of oceanic pack ice allows increased exchange of waters between the Arctic and the North Atlantic Oceans, warming the Arctic and cooling the North Atlantic. (Current projected consequences of global warming include a largely ice-free Arctic Ocean within 5–20 years, see Arctic shrinkage.) Additional fresh water flowing into the North Atlantic during a warming cycle may also reduce the global ocean water circulation. Such a reduction (by reducing the effects of the Gulf Stream) would have a cooling effect on northern Europe, which in turn would lead to increased low-latitude snow retention during the summer. It has also been suggested that during an extensive glacial, glaciers may move through the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, extending into the North Atlantic Ocean far enough to block the Gulf Stream.\n\nIce sheets that form during glaciations cause erosion of the land beneath them. After some time, this will reduce land above sea level and thus diminish the amount of space on which ice sheets can form. This mitigates the albedo feedback, as does the lowering in sea level that accompanies the formation of ice sheets.\n\nAnother factor is the increased aridity occurring with glacial maxima, which reduces the precipitation available to maintain glaciation. The glacial retreat induced by this or any other process can be amplified by similar inverse positive feedbacks as for glacial advances.\n\nAccording to research published in \"Nature Geoscience\", human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO) will defer the next ice age. Researchers used data on Earth's orbit to find the historical warm interglacial period that looks most like the current one and from this have predicted that the next ice age would usually begin within 1,500 years. They go on to say that emissions have been so high that it will not.\n\nThe causes of ice ages are not fully understood for either the large-scale ice age periods or the smaller ebb and flow of glacial–interglacial periods within an ice age. The consensus is that several factors are important: atmospheric composition, such as the concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane (the specific levels of the previously mentioned gases are now able to be seen with the new ice core samples from EPICA Dome C in Antarctica over the past 800,000 years); changes in the earth's orbit around the Sun known as Milankovitch cycles; the motion of tectonic plates resulting in changes in the relative location and amount of continental and oceanic crust on the earth's surface, which affect wind and ocean currents; variations in solar output; the orbital dynamics of the Earth–Moon system; the impact of relatively large meteorites and volcanism including eruptions of supervolcanoes.\n\nSome of these factors influence each other. For example, changes in Earth's atmospheric composition (especially the concentrations of greenhouse gases) may alter the climate, while climate change itself can change the atmospheric composition (for example by changing the rate at which weathering removes ).\n\nMaureen Raymo, William Ruddiman and others propose that the Tibetan and Colorado Plateaus are immense \"scrubbers\" with a capacity to remove enough from the global atmosphere to be a significant causal factor of the 40 million year Cenozoic Cooling trend. They further claim that approximately half of their uplift (and \"scrubbing\" capacity) occurred in the past 10 million years.\n\nThere is evidence that greenhouse gas levels fell at the start of ice ages and rose during the retreat of the ice sheets, but it is difficult to establish cause and effect (see the notes above on the role of weathering). Greenhouse gas levels may also have been affected by other factors which have been proposed as causes of ice ages, such as the movement of continents and volcanism.\n\nThe Snowball Earth hypothesis maintains that the severe freezing in the late Proterozoic was ended by an increase in levels in the atmosphere, mainly from volcanoes, and some supporters of Snowball Earth argue that it was caused in the first place by a reduction in atmospheric . The hypothesis also warns of future Snowball Earths.\n\nIn 2009, further evidence was provided that changes in solar insolation provide the initial trigger for the earth to warm after an Ice Age, with secondary factors like increases in greenhouse gases accounting for the magnitude of the change.\n\nThere is considerable evidence that over the very recent period of the last 100–1000 years, the sharp increases in human activity, especially the burning of fossil fuels, has caused the parallel sharp and accelerating increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases which trap the sun's heat. The consensus theory of the scientific community is that the resulting greenhouse effect is a principal cause of the increase in global warming which has occurred over the same period, and a chief contributor to the accelerated melting of the remaining glaciers and polar ice. A 2012 investigation finds that dinosaurs released methane through digestion in a similar amount to humanity's current methane release, which \"could have been a key factor\" to the very warm climate 150 million years ago.\n\nWilliam Ruddiman has proposed the early anthropocene hypothesis, according to which the anthropocene era, as some people call the most recent period in the earth's history when the activities of the human species first began to have a significant global impact on the earth's climate and ecosystems, did not begin in the 18th century with the advent of the Industrial Era, but dates back to 8,000 years ago, due to intense farming activities of our early agrarian ancestors. It was at that time that atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations stopped following the periodic pattern of the Milankovitch cycles. In his overdue-glaciation hypothesis Ruddiman states that an incipient glacial would probably have begun several thousand years ago, but the arrival of that scheduled glacial was forestalled by the activities of early farmers.\n\nAt a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (December 17, 2008), scientists detailed evidence in support of the controversial idea that the introduction of large-scale rice agriculture in Asia, coupled with extensive deforestation in Europe began to alter world climate by pumping significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere over the last 1,000 years. In turn, a warmer atmosphere heated the oceans making them much less efficient storehouses of carbon dioxide and reinforcing global warming, possibly forestalling the onset of a new glacial age.\n\nThe geological record appears to show that ice ages start when the continents are in positions which block or reduce the flow of warm water from the equator to the poles and thus allow ice sheets to form. The ice sheets increase Earth's reflectivity and thus reduce the absorption of solar radiation. With less radiation absorbed the atmosphere cools; the cooling allows the ice sheets to grow, which further increases reflectivity in a positive feedback loop. The ice age continues until the reduction in weathering causes an increase in the greenhouse effect.\n\nThere are three main contributors from the layout of the continents that obstruct the movement of warm water to the poles:\n\nSince today's Earth has a continent over the South Pole and an almost land-locked ocean over the North Pole, geologists believe that Earth will continue to experience glacial periods in the geologically near future.\n\nSome scientists believe that the Himalayas are a major factor in the current ice age, because these mountains have increased Earth's total rainfall and therefore the rate at which carbon dioxide is washed out of the atmosphere, decreasing the greenhouse effect. The Himalayas' formation started about 70 million years ago when the Indo-Australian Plate collided with the Eurasian Plate, and the Himalayas are still rising by about 5 mm per year because the Indo-Australian plate is still moving at 67 mm/year. The history of the Himalayas broadly fits the long-term decrease in Earth's average temperature since the mid-Eocene, 40 million years ago.\n\nAnother important contribution to ancient climate regimes is the variation of ocean currents, which are modified by continent position, sea levels and salinity, as well as other factors. They have the ability to cool (e.g. aiding the creation of Antarctic ice) and the ability to warm (e.g. giving the British Isles a temperate as opposed to a boreal climate). The closing of the Isthmus of Panama about 3 million years ago may have ushered in the present period of strong glaciation over North America by ending the exchange of water between the tropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n\nAnalyses suggest that ocean current fluctuations can adequately account for recent glacial oscillations. During the last glacial period the sea-level has fluctuated 20–30 m as water was sequestered, primarily in the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. When ice collected and the sea level dropped sufficiently, flow through the Bering Strait (the narrow strait between Siberia and Alaska is about 50 m deep today) was reduced, resulting in increased flow from the North Atlantic. This realigned the thermohaline circulation in the Atlantic, increasing heat transport into the Arctic, which melted the polar ice accumulation and reduced other continental ice sheets. The release of water raised sea levels again, restoring the ingress of colder water from the Pacific with an accompanying shift to northern hemisphere ice accumulation.\n\nMatthias Kuhle's geological theory of Ice Age development was suggested by the existence of an ice sheet covering the Tibetan Plateau during the Ice Ages (Last Glacial Maximum?). According to Kuhle, the plate-tectonic uplift of Tibet past the snow-line has led to a surface of c. 2,400,000 square kilometres (930,000 sq mi) changing from bare land to ice with a 70% greater albedo. The reflection of energy into space resulted in a global cooling, triggering the Pleistocene Ice Age. Because this highland is at a subtropical latitude, with 4 to 5 times the insolation of high-latitude areas, what would be Earth's strongest heating surface has turned into a cooling surface.\n\nKuhle explains the interglacial periods by the 100,000-year cycle of radiation changes due to variations in Earth's orbit. This comparatively insignificant warming, when combined with the lowering of the Nordic inland ice areas and Tibet due to the weight of the superimposed ice-load, has led to the repeated complete thawing of the inland ice areas.\n\nThe Milankovitch cycles are a set of cyclic variations in characteristics of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Each cycle has a different length, so at some times their effects reinforce each other and at other times they (partially) cancel each other.\n\nThere is strong evidence that the Milankovitch cycles affect the occurrence of glacial and interglacial periods within an ice age. The present ice age is the most studied and best understood, particularly the last 400,000 years, since this is the period covered by ice cores that record atmospheric composition and proxies for temperature and ice volume. Within this period, the match of glacial/interglacial frequencies to the Milanković orbital forcing periods is so close that orbital forcing is generally accepted. The combined effects of the changing distance to the Sun, the precession of the Earth's axis, and the changing tilt of the Earth's axis redistribute the sunlight received by the Earth. Of particular importance are changes in the tilt of the Earth's axis, which affect the intensity of seasons. For example, the amount of solar influx in July at 65 degrees north latitude varies by as much as 22% (from 450 W/m² to 550 W/m²). It is widely believed that ice sheets advance when summers become too cool to melt all of the accumulated snowfall from the previous winter. Some believe that the strength of the orbital forcing is too small to trigger glaciations, but feedback mechanisms like may explain this mismatch.\n\nWhile Milankovitch forcing predicts that cyclic changes in the Earth's orbital elements can be expressed in the glaciation record, additional explanations are necessary to explain which cycles are observed to be most important in the timing of glacial–interglacial periods. In particular, during the last 800,000 years, the dominant period of glacial–interglacial oscillation has been 100,000 years, which corresponds to changes in Earth's orbital eccentricity and orbital inclination. Yet this is by far the weakest of the three frequencies predicted by Milankovitch. During the period 3.0–0.8 million years ago, the dominant pattern of glaciation corresponded to the 41,000-year period of changes in Earth's obliquity (tilt of the axis). The reasons for dominance of one frequency versus another are poorly understood and an active area of current research, but the answer probably relates to some form of resonance in the Earth's climate system. Recent work suggests that the 100K year cycle dominates due to increased southern-pole sea-ice increasing total solar reflectivity.\n\nThe \"traditional\" Milankovitch explanation struggles to explain the dominance of the 100,000-year cycle over the last 8 cycles. Richard A. Muller, Gordon J. F. MacDonald, and others have pointed out that those calculations are for a two-dimensional orbit of Earth but the three-dimensional orbit also has a 100,000-year cycle of orbital inclination. They proposed that these variations in orbital inclination lead to variations in insolation, as the Earth moves in and out of known dust bands in the solar system. Although this is a different mechanism to the traditional view, the \"predicted\" periods over the last 400,000 years are nearly the same. The Muller and MacDonald theory, in turn, has been challenged by Jose Antonio Rial.\n\nAnother worker, William Ruddiman, has suggested a model that explains the 100,000-year cycle by the modulating effect of eccentricity (weak 100,000-year cycle) on precession (26,000-year cycle) combined with greenhouse gas feedbacks in the 41,000- and 26,000-year cycles. Yet another theory has been advanced by Peter Huybers who argued that the 41,000-year cycle has always been dominant, but that the Earth has entered a mode of climate behavior where only the second or third cycle triggers an ice age. This would imply that the 100,000-year periodicity is really an illusion created by averaging together cycles lasting 80,000 and 120,000 years. This theory is consistent with a simple empirical multi-state model proposed by Didier Paillard. Paillard suggests that the late Pleistocene glacial cycles\ncan be seen as jumps between three quasi-stable climate states. The jumps are induced by the orbital forcing, while in the early Pleistocene the 41,000-year glacial cycles resulted from jumps between only two climate states. A dynamical\nmodel explaining this behavior was proposed by Peter Ditlevsen. This is in support of the suggestion that the late Pleistocene glacial cycles are not due to the weak 100,000-year eccentricity cycle, but a non-linear response to mainly the 41,000-year obliquity cycle.\n\nThere are at least two types of variation in the Sun's energy output\n\nThe long-term increase in the Sun's output cannot be a cause of ice ages.\n\nVolcanic eruptions may have contributed to the inception and/or the end of ice age periods. At times during the paleoclimate, carbon dioxide levels were two or three times greater than today. Volcanoes and movements in continental plates contributed to high amounts of CO in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide from volcanoes probably contributed to periods with highest overall temperatures. One suggested explanation of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum is that undersea volcanoes released methane from clathrates and thus caused a large and rapid increase in the greenhouse effect. There appears to be no geological evidence for such eruptions at the right time, but this does not prove they did not happen.\n\nThe current ice age, called the Quaternary glaciation, which began 2.6 million years ago and extends into the present, has seen more or less extensive glaciation on 40,000 and later, 100,000 year cycles. The interglacials lasted about 10,000–20,000 years. The last glacial period ended about 11,500 years ago. Since then, Earth has been in an interglacial period called the Holocene.\n\nThe major glacial stages of the current ice age in North America are the Illinoian, Eemian and Wisconsin glaciation. The use of the Nebraskan, Afton, Kansan, and Yarmouthian stages to subdivide the ice age in North America has been discontinued by Quaternary geologists and geomorphologists. These stages have all been merged into the Pre-Illinoian in the 1980s.\n\nDuring the most recent North American glaciation, during the latter part of the Last Glacial Maximum (26,000 to 13,300 years ago), ice sheets extended to about 45th parallel north. These sheets were thick.\n\nThis Wisconsin glaciation left widespread impacts on the North American landscape. The Great Lakes and the Finger Lakes were carved by ice deepening old valleys. Most of the lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin were gouged out by glaciers and later filled with glacial meltwaters. The old Teays River drainage system was radically altered and largely reshaped into the Ohio River drainage system. Other rivers were dammed and diverted to new channels, such as Niagara Falls, which formed a dramatic waterfall and gorge, when the waterflow encountered a limestone escarpment. Another similar waterfall, at the present Clark Reservation State Park near Syracuse, New York, is now dry.\n\nThe area from Long Island to Nantucket, Massachusetts was formed from glacial till, and the plethora of lakes on the Canadian Shield in northern Canada can be almost entirely attributed to the action of the ice. As the ice retreated and the rock dust dried, winds carried the material hundreds of miles, forming beds of loess many dozens of feet thick in the Missouri Valley. Post-glacial rebound continues to reshape the Great Lakes and other areas formerly under the weight of the ice sheets.\n\nThe Driftless Area, a portion of western and southwestern Wisconsin along with parts of adjacent Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois, was not covered by glaciers.\nA specially interesting climatic change during glacial times has taken place in the semi-arid Andes. Beside the expected cooling down in comparison with the current climate, a significant precipitation change happened here. So, researches in the presently semiarid subtropic Aconcagua-massif (6,962 m) have shown an unexpectedly extensive glacial glaciation of the type \"ice stream network\". The connected valley glaciers exceeding 100 km in length, flowed down on the East-side of this section of the Andes at 32–34°S and 69–71°W as far as a height of 2,060 m and on the western luff-side still clearly deeper. Where current glaciers scarcely reach 10 km in length, the snowline (ELA) runs at a height of 4,600 m and at that time was lowered to 3,200 m asl, i.e. about 1,400 m. From this follows that—beside of an annual depression of temperature about c. 8.4 °C— here was an increase in precipitation. Accordingly, at glacial times the humid climatic belt that today is situated several latitude degrees further to the S, was shifted much further to the N.\n\nAlthough the last glacial period ended more than 8,000 years ago, its effects can still be felt today. For example, the moving ice carved out the landscape in Canada (See Canadian Arctic Archipelago), Greenland, northern Eurasia and Antarctica. The erratic boulders, till, drumlins, eskers, fjords, kettle lakes, moraines, cirques, horns, etc., are typical features left behind by the glaciers.\n\nThe weight of the ice sheets was so great that they deformed the Earth's crust and mantle. After the ice sheets melted, the ice-covered land rebounded. Due to the high viscosity of the Earth's mantle, the flow of mantle rocks which controls the rebound process is very slow—at a rate of about 1 cm/year near the center of rebound area today.\n\nDuring glaciation, water was taken from the oceans to form the ice at high latitudes, thus global sea level dropped by about 110 meters, exposing the continental shelves and forming land-bridges between land-masses for animals to migrate. During deglaciation, the melted ice-water returned to the oceans, causing sea level to rise. This process can cause sudden shifts in coastlines and hydration systems resulting in newly submerged lands, emerging lands, collapsed ice dams resulting in salination of lakes, new ice dams creating vast areas of freshwater, and a general alteration in regional weather patterns on a large but temporary scale. It can even cause temporary reglaciation. This type of chaotic pattern of rapidly changing land, ice, saltwater and freshwater has been proposed as the likely model for the Baltic and Scandinavian regions, as well as much of central North America at the end of the last glacial maximum, with the present-day coastlines only being achieved in the last few millennia of prehistory. Also, the effect of elevation on Scandinavia submerged a vast continental plain that had existed under much of what is now the North Sea, connecting the British Isles to Continental Europe.\n\nThe redistribution of ice-water on the surface of the Earth and the flow of mantle rocks causes changes in the gravitational field as well as changes to the distribution of the moment of inertia of the Earth. These changes to the moment of inertia result in a change in the angular velocity, axis, and wobble of the Earth's rotation.\n\nThe weight of the redistributed surface mass loaded the lithosphere, caused it to flex and also induced stress within the Earth. The presence of the glaciers generally suppressed the movement of faults below. During deglaciation, the faults experience accelerated slip triggering earthquakes. Earthquakes triggered near the ice margin may in turn accelerate ice calving and may account for the Heinrich events. As more ice is removed near the ice margin, more intraplate earthquakes are induced and this positive feedback may explain the fast collapse of ice sheets.\n\nIn Europe, glacial erosion and isostatic sinking from weight of ice made the Baltic Sea, which before the Ice Age was all land drained by the Eridanos River.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "77235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=77235", "title": "Maenad", "text": "Maenad\n\nIn Greek mythology, maenads (; ) were the female followers of Dionysus and the most significant members of the Thiasus, the god's retinue. Their name literally translates as \"raving ones\". Maenads were known as Bassarids, Bacchae or Bacchantes in Roman mythology after the penchant of the equivalent Roman god, Bacchus, to wear a bassaris or fox-skin.\n\nOften the maenads were portrayed as inspired by Dionysus into a state of ecstatic frenzy through a combination of dancing and intoxication. During these rites, the maenads would dress in fawn skins and carry a thyrsus, a long stick wrapped in ivy or vine leaves and tipped with a pine cone. They would weave ivy-wreaths around their heads or wear a bull helmet in honor of their god, and often handle or wear snakes. \n\nThese women were mythologized as the 'mad women' who were nurses of Dionysus in Nysa. Lycurgus \"chased the Nurses of the frenzied Dionysus through the holy hills of Nysa, and the sacred implements dropped to the ground from the hands of one and all, as the murderous Lycurgus struck them down with his ox-goad\". They went into the mountains at night and practiced strange rites.\n\nAccording to Plutarch's \"Life of Alexander\", maenads were called \"Mimallones\" and \"Klodones\" in Macedon, epithets derived from the feminine art of spinning wool. Nevertheless, these warlike \"parthenoi\" (\"virgins\") from the hills, associated with a \"Dionysios pseudanor\" \"fake male Dionysus\", routed an invading enemy. In southern Greece they were described with \"Bacchae\", \"Bassarides\", \"Thyiades\", \"Potniades\" and other epithets.\n\nThe term \"maenad\" has come to be associated with a wide variety of women, supernatural, mythological, and historical, associated with the god Dionysus and his worship.\nIn Euripides' play \"The Bacchae\", maenads of Thebes murder King Pentheus after he bans the worship of Dionysus. Dionysus, Pentheus' cousin, himself lures Pentheus to the woods, where the maenads tear him apart. His corpse is mutilated by his own mother, Agave, who tears off his head, believing it to be that of a lion. A group of maenads also kill Orpheus.\n\nIn ceramic art, the frolicking of Maenads and Dionysus is often a theme depicted on kraters, used to mix water and wine. These scenes show the maenads in their frenzy running in the forests, often tearing to pieces any animal they happen to come across.\n\nGerman philologist Walter Friedrich Otto writes:\n\nCultist rites associated with worship of the Greek god of wine, Dionysus (or Bacchus in Roman mythology), were allegedly characterized by maniacal dancing to the sound of loud music and crashing cymbals, in which the revelers, called Bacchantes, whirled, screamed, became drunk and incited one another to greater and greater ecstasy. The goal was to achieve a state of enthusiasm in which the celebrants’ souls were temporarily freed from their earthly bodies and were able to commune with Bacchus/Dionysus and gain a glimpse of and a preparation for what they would someday experience in eternity. The rite climaxed in a performance of frenzied feats of strength and madness, such as uprooting trees, tearing a bull (the symbol of Dionysus) apart with their bare hands, an act called \"sparagmos\", and eating its flesh raw, an act called \"omophagia\". This latter rite was a sacrament akin to communion in which the participants assumed the strength and character of the god by symbolically eating the raw flesh and drinking the blood of his symbolic incarnation. Having symbolically eaten his body and drunk his blood, the celebrants became possessed by Dionysus.\n\n'Maenads' are found in later references as priestesses of the Dionystic cult. In the third century BC, when an Asia Minor city wanted to create a maenadic cult of Dionysus, the Delphic Oracle bid them to send to Thebes for both instruction and three professional maenads, stating, \"Go to the holy plain of Thebes so that you may get maenads who are from the family of Ino, daughter of Cadmus. They will give to you both the rites and good practices, and they will establish dance groups (thiasoi) of Bacchus [ie: Dionysus] in your city.\"\n\nDionysus came to his birthplace, Thebes, where neither Pentheus, his cousin who was now king, nor Pentheus’ mother Agave, Dionysus’ aunt (Semele’s sister) acknowledged his divinity. Dionysus punished Agave by driving her insane, and in that condition, she killed her son and tore him to pieces. From Thebes, Dionysus went to Argos where all the women except the daughters of King Proetus joined in his worship. Dionysus punished them by driving them mad, and they killed the infants who were nursing at their breasts. He did the same to the daughters of Minyas, King of Orchomenos in Boetia, and then turned them into bats.\nAccording to Opian, Dionysus delighted, as a child, in tearing kids into pieces and bringing them back to life again. He is characterized as \"the raging one\", and \"the mad one\", and the nature of the maenads, from which they get their name, is, therefore, his nature.\n\nOnce during a war in the middle of the third century BC, the entranced Thyiades (maenads) lost their way and arrived in Amphissa, a city near Delphi. There they sank down exhausted in the market place and were overpowered by a deep sleep. The women of Amphissa formed a protective ring around them and when they awoke arranged for them to return home unmolested.\n\nOn another occasion, the Thyiades were snowed in on Parnassos and it was necessary to send a rescue party. The clothing of the men who took part in the rescue froze solid. It is unlikely that the Thyiades, even if they wore deerskins over their shoulders, were ever dressed more warmly than the men.\n\nIn the realm of the supernatural is the category of nymphs who nurse and care for the young Dionysus, and continue in his worship as he comes of age. The god Hermes is said to have carried the young Dionysus to the nymphs of Nysa.\n\nIn another myth, when his mother, Semele, is killed, the care of young Dionysus falls into the hands of his sisters, Ino, Agave, and Autonoe, who later are depicted as participating in the rites and taking a leadership role among the other maenads.\n\nThe term 'maenads' also refers to women in the mythology who resisted the worship of Dionysus, and were therefore driven mad by him, forced against their will to participate in often horrific rites. The doubting women of Thebes, the prototypical maenads, or 'mad women', left their homes to live in the wilds of the nearby mountain Cithaeron. When they discover Pentheus spying on them, dressed as a maenad, they tear him limb from limb.\n\nThis also occurs with the three daughters of Minyas, who reject Dionysus and remain true to their household duties, becoming startled by invisible drums, flutes, cymbals, and seeing ivy hanging down from their looms. As punishment for their resistance, they become madwomen, choosing the child of one of their number by lot and tearing it to pieces, as the women on the mountain did to young animals. A similar story with a tragic end is told of the daughters of Proetus.\n\nNot all women were inclined to resist the call of Dionysus, however. Maenads, possessed by the spirit of Dionysus, traveled with him from Thrace to mainland Greece in his quest for the recognition of his divinity. Dionysus was said to have danced down from Parnassos accompanied by Delphic virgins, and it is known that even as young girls the women in Boeotia practiced not only the closed rites but also the bearing of the thyrsus and the dances.\n\nThe foundation myth is believed to have been reenacted every other year during the Agrionia. Here the women of Thebes were organized into three dance groups and rushed off to Mount Cithaeron with ritual cries of \"to the mountain!\" As \"mad women,\" they pursued and killed, perhaps by dismemberment (sparagmos), the 'king', possibly represented by a goat. The maenads may have eaten the meat of the goat raw (omophagia) or sacrificed it to Dionysus. Eventually the women would be freed from the madness and return to Thebes and their usual lives, but for the time of the festival they would have had an intense ecstatic experience. The Agrionia was celebrated in several Greek cities, but especially in Boeotia. Each Boeotian city had its own distinct foundation myth for it, but the pattern was much the same: the arrival of Dionysus, resistance to him, flight of the women to a mountain, the killing of Dionysus’ persecutor, and eventual reconciliation with the god.\n\nMaenads have been depicted in art as erratic and frenzied women enveloped in a drunken rapture, the most obvious example being that of Euripides’ play The Bacchae. His play, however, is not a study of the cult of Dionysus or the effects of this religious hysteria of these women. The maenads have often been interpreted in art in this way. To understand the play of Euripides though one must only know about the religious ecstasy called Dionysiac, the most common moment maenads are displayed in art. In Euripides' play and other art forms and works the Dionysiac only needs to be understood as the frenzied dances of the god which are direct manifestations of euphoric possession and that these worshippers, sometimes by eating the flesh of a man or animal who has temporarily incarnated the god, come to partake of his divinity.\n\nIn addition to Euripides' The Bacchae, depictions of maenads are often found on both red and black figure Greek pottery, statues and jewellery. Also, fragments of reliefs of female worshippers of Dionysus have been discovered at Corinth. Mark W. Edwards in his paper \"Representation of Maenads on Archaic Red-Figure Vases\" traces the evolution of maenad's depictions on Red-Figure vases. Edwards distinguishes between \"nymphs\" which appear earlier on Greek pottery and \"maenads\" which are identified by their characteristic fawnskin or \"nebris\" and often carrying snakes in their hands. However, Edwards does not consider the actions of the figures on the pottery to be a distinguishing characteristic for differentiation between maenads and nymphs. Rather, the differences or similarities in their actions are more striking when comparing black-figure and red-figure pottery, as opposed to maenads and nymphs.\n\nA maenad appears in Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem, \"Ode to the West Wind\".\n\nIn Ivan Turgenev's novella, \"First Love\", bacchantes are used symbolically in a dream of princess Zinaida.\n\n\"The Bassarids\" (composed 1964–65, premiered 1966), to a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is the most famous opera composed by Hans Werner Henze.\n\nMaenads, along with Bacchus and Silenus, appear in C. S. Lewis' \"Prince Caspian\". They are portrayed as wild, fierce girls who dance and perform somersaults.\n\nPoul Anderson's \"Goat Song\" depicts a far-future utopia where all human activity has been \"optimized\" by the artificial intelligence SUM. To placate their fear of dying, citizens of this utopia are promised resurrection using DNA and memory records collected by bracelets that everyone wears. Rebelling against nonhuman control, one citizen called Harper (identified with Orpheus) awakens atavism in a group of women who spend holidays in the wild living as maenads.\n\nIn the short story \"Las Ménades\", by Julio Cortázar, originally published in \"Final del juego\" in 1956, describes a concert in which the narrator does not react emotionally to the music; but a number of women are overwhelmed with emotion, and surge onto the stage, overtaking the conductor and musicians.\n\nIn Piers Anthony's Xanth series, the Maenads are depicted as women frenzied with bloodlust. The Maenads were temporarily quelled by Magician Grey as his talent is nullification of magic. In combination with a large python protecting the Oracle's Cave, the Maenads presence is to protect Mount Parnassus (see \"Man from Mundania\").\n\nMaenads are the adopted symbol of Tetovo in Macedonia, depicted prominently of the city's coat of arms. The inclusion of maenad imagery dates to 1932, when a small statuette of a maenad, dating to the 6th-century BC, was found in the city. The \"Tetovo Maenad\" was featured on the reverse of a Macedonian 5000 denar banknote issued in 1996.\n\nIn \"\", the seventh volume of Neil Gaiman's comic series \"The Sandman\", the maenads feature in the story \"Orpheus\", in which they gruesomely murder the titular character after he refuses to cavort with them (echoing the events of the actual Greek myth of Orpheus).\n\nIn the horror novel \"Dominion\" by Bentley Little, maenads are eventually revealed as the main antagonists for the first half of the story, during which they tear their victims to shreds and conspire to reawaken Dionysus.\n\nCharlaine Harris' \"The Southern Vampire Mysteries\" series of novels and its television adaptation, the HBO series \"True Blood\" (2nd season, aired in summer 2009), feature maenads in the characters of Callisto and her television representation, Maryann, respectively. In the show, Maryann wishes to sacrifice Sam Merlotte in hopes of summoning her god, Dionysus. In the TV series, Maryann is portrayed by Michelle Forbes. \n\nThe \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" novel \"\" depicts maenads as corrupted human beings in service of the ancient and powerful Greek vampire Kakistos.\n\nThe Maenads appear in Rick Riordan's \"The Demigod Diaries\", where they are the principal enemies in the story \"Leo Valdez and the Quest for Buford\". While looking for the automaton table, Buford, Leo, Jason, and Piper run into the Maenads, who are searching for Dionysus. They chase Leo and Piper into Bunker 9, and are subsequently captured in a golden net.\n\nMaenads appear in the \"Sailor Moon\" manga by Naoko Takeuchi as two priestesses guarding the shrine of Elysion in the Golden Kingdom of Earth.\n\nMaenads also appear in \"A Girl By Any Other Name\", an episode of \"Atlantis\".\n\nThe Japanese cosmetics company Nippon Menard Cosmetic Co. is named after them.\n\nThe short story Last Call of Jim Butcher's The Dresden Files features a maenad as a primary antagonist.\n\n\n\n"}

The stratovolcano is located on the borders of Gifu and Ishikawa (which are in Honshu) prefectures in Japan. It is thought to have first been active 300,000 to 400,000 years ago, with the most recent eruption occurring in 1659. Along with Mount Tate and Mount Fuji, it is one of Japan's .\n\nThe mountain's tallest peak, Gozengamine (御前峰), is the one that gives the mountain its height of . Along with Kengamine (剣ヶ峰), which is , and Ōnanjimine (大汝峰), which is , the three peaks are considered \"Mount Haku's Three Peaks\" (白山三峰 \"Hakusan Sanmine\"). Mount Bessan and Mount Sannomine are sometimes included and called \"Mount Haku's Five Peaks\".\n\nBecause it is very prominent and clearly visible from the nearby coast, even after the surrounding mountains have lost their snow, Mount Haku still appears white, which is one explanation for the mountain's name, which means \"white mountain.\" It is also the westernmost mountain in Japan that is over in height.\n\nTaichō was the first to climb Mount Haku in 717. For hundreds of years, people have come to Haku for prayers (白山信仰 \"Hakusan Shinkō\"). A branch shrine of Shirayama Hime Shrine, which served as the supreme shrine for Kaga Province, is on the mountain. The Shirayama Hime Shrine is the of approximately 2,000 in Japan. In 1980 an area of 48,000 ha was designated a UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Reserve.\n\nMount Haku was designated as a quasi-national park in 1955. It became a national park in 1962 and was renamed Hakusan National Park. Because the central part of the mountain has much precipitous terrain, there are very few roads and, as a result, little human intrusion into the area. Also limiting human intrusion is the designation of the park as a Wildlife Protection Area, covering over 38,061 ha. The park stretches beyond the mountain's borders into Toyama Prefecture.\n\nThe area surrounding Mount Haku is one of the few in Japan that contains outcroppings from the Jurassic period of the Mesozoic era. Many of Japan's typical examples of dinosaur fossils were found in this area. One of the major rock outcrops is in the Kuwashima area and is known as the \"Kuwashima Fossil Wall\" (桑島化石壁 \"Kuwashima Kasekikabe\").\n\nBecause the mountain is a dormant volcano, it is well known for its many onsen.\n\nMount Haku is known for its diverse plant life. Along the Sabō Trail, after passing the Jinnosuke Lodge, alpine plants are found, including the chocolate lily, which is Ishikawa's prefectural plant.\n\nThere are many alpine plants which have \"Hakusan\" in their name. These include Primula cuneifolia (\"Hakusan Kozakura\"), Anemone narcissiflora (\"Hakusan Ichige\"), Dactylorhiza (\"Hakusan Chidori\"), Geranium yesoemse (\"Hakusan Fuuro\") and Rhododendron brachycarpum (\"Hakusan Shakunage\"). These plants can be found on many mountains throughout Japan, but they were first discovered and named along the older hiking trails leading to Hakusan Shrine.\n\nThe golden eagle, Ishikawa's prefectural bird, lives on the slopes of Mount Haku. The rock ptarmigan, Gifu's prefectural bird, used to live on the slopes as well. During the Meiji period, the entire population of ptarmigan on the mountain disappeared; however, sightings of the grouse have recently been recorded by local residents.\n\nThe three most used hiking trails are the Kankō Trail (観光新道 \"Kankō Shinmichi\"), the Sabō Trail (砂防新道 \"Sabō Shinmichi\") and the Hirase Trail (平瀬道 \"Hirase-dō\"). Both the Kankō Trail and the Sabō trail originate in the city of Hakusan, Ishikawa Prefecture, but the Hirase Trail starts from the Ōshirakawa Dam (大白川ダム) in Gifu Prefecture.\n\nBecause the area is protected as a national park, very few trails have been made on the mountain. Though the trails listed above are easy enough to hike up and down in one day, other trails can take two or three days because of the uncleared trails and rough terrain.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4021143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4021143", "title": "Mount Meru (Buddhism)", "text": "Mount Meru (Buddhism)\n\n\"For the equivalent central mountain in Hindu cosmology, see Mount Meru\"\n\nMount Meru (also Sumeru (Sanskrit) or Sineru (Pāli) or Kangrinboqe) is the name of the central world-mountain in Buddhist cosmology. Etymologically, the proper name of the mountain is Meru (Pāli Meru), to which is added the approbatory prefix su-, resulting in the meaning \"excellent Meru\" or \"wonderful Meru\".\n\nThe concept of Sumeru is closely related to the central Mount Meru of Hindu cosmology, but it differs from the Hindu concept in several particulars.\n\nAccording to Vasubandhu's \" (philosophical writings)\", Sumeru is 80,000 \"yojanas\" tall. The exact measure of one \"yojana\" is uncertain, but some accounts put it at about 24,000 feet, or approximately 4-1/2 miles, but other accounts put it at about 7-9 miles. It also descends beneath the surface of the surrounding waters to a depth of 80,000 yojanas, being founded upon the basal layer of Earth. Sumeru is often used as a simile for both size and stability in Buddhist texts.\n\nSumeru is said to be shaped like an hourglass, with a top and base of 80,000 yojanas square, but narrowing in the middle (i.e., at a height of 40,000 yojanas) to 20,000 yojanas square.\n\nSumeru is the polar center of a mandala-like complex of seas and mountains. The square base of Sumeru is surrounded by a square moat-like ocean, which is in turn surrounded by a ring (or rather square) wall of mountains, which is in turn surrounded by a sea, each diminishing in width and height from the one closer to Sumeru. There are seven seas and seven surrounding mountain-walls, until one comes to the vast outer sea which forms most of the surface of the world, in which the known continents are merely small islands. The known world, which is on the continent of Jambudvipa, is directly south of Sumeru.\n\nThe dimensions stated in the \"\" are shown in the table below:\n\nThe 80,000 yojana square top of Sumeru constitutes the \"heaven\" (devaloka), which is the highest plane in direct physical contact with the earth. The next 40,000 yojanas below this heaven consist of sheer precipice, narrowing in like an inverted mountain until it is 20,000 yojanas square at a heigh of 40,000 yojanas above the sea.\n\nFrom this point Sumeru expands again, going down in four terraced ledges, each broader than the one above. The first terrace constitutes the \"heaven\" of the Four Great Kings and is divided into four parts, facing north, south, east and west. Each section is governed by one of the Four Great Kings, who faces outward toward the quarter of the world that he supervises.\n\n40,000 yojanas is also the height at which the Sun and Moon circle Sumeru in a clockwise direction. This rotation explains the alteration of day and night; when the Sun is north of Sumeru, the shadow of the mountain is cast over the continent of Jambudvīpa, and it is night there; at the same time it is noon in the opposing northern continent of Uttarakuru, dawn in the eastern continent of Pūrvavideha, and dusk in the western continent of Aparagodānīya. Half a day later, when the Sun has moved to the south, it is noon in Jambudvīpa, dusk in Pūrvavideha, dawn in Aparagodānīya, and midnight in Uttarakuru.\n\nThe next three terraces down the slopes of Sumeru are each longer and broader by a factor of two. They contain the followers of the Four Great Kings, namely nāgas, , gandharvas, and . \n\nThe names and dimensions of the terraces on the lower slopes of Sumeru are given below:\n\nBelow Sumeru, in the seas around it, is the abode of the Asuras who are at war with the gods.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "292211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=292211", "title": "Mud", "text": "Mud\n\nMud is a liquid or semi-liquid mixture of water and any combination of different kinds of soil (loam, silt, and clay). It usually forms after rainfall or near water sources. Ancient mud deposits harden over geological time to form sedimentary rock such as shale or mudstone (generally called lutites). When geological deposits of mud are formed in estuaries, the resultant layers are termed bay muds.\n\nIn the construction industry, mud is a semi-fluid material that can be used to coat, seal, or adhere materials. Depending on the composition of the mud, it can be referred by many different names, including slurry, mortar, plaster, stucco, and concrete.\n\nMud, cob, adobe, clay, and many other names are historically used synonymously to mean a mixture of subsoil and water possibly with the addition of stones, gravel, straw, lime, and/or bitumen. This material was used a variety of ways to build walls, floors and even roofs. For thousands of years it was common in most parts of the world to build walls using mudbricks or the wattle and daub, rammed earth or cob techniques and cover the surfaces with earthen plaster.\n\nMud can be made into mud bricks, also called adobe, by mixing mud with water, placing the mixture into moulds and then allowing it to dry in open air. Straw is sometimes used as a binder within the bricks, as it adds a support lattice. When the brick would otherwise break, the straw will redistribute the force throughout the brick, decreasing the chance of breakage. Such buildings must be protected from groundwater, usually by building upon a masonry, fired brick, rock or rubble foundation, and also from wind-driven rain in damp climates, usually by deep roof overhangs. In extremely dry climates a well drained flat roof may be protected with a well-prepared (puddled) and properly maintained dried mud coating, viable as the mud will expand when moistened and so become more water resistant. Adobe mudbricks were commonly used by the Pueblo Indians to build their homes and other necessary structures.\n\nMud that is mostly clay, or a mixture of clay and sand may be used for ceramics, of which one form is the common fired brick. Fired brick are more durable but consume much more energy to produce.\n\nStabilized mud (earth, soil) is mud which has had a binder such as cement or bitumen added. Examples are mudcrete, landcrete, and soil cement.\n\nPottery is made by forming a clay body into objects of a required shape and heating them to high temperatures in a kiln which removes all the water from the clay, which induces reactions that lead to permanent changes including increasing their strength and hardening and setting their shape. A clay body can be decorated before or after firing. Prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared. Kneading helps to ensure an even moisture content throughout the body. Air trapped within the clay body needs to be removed. This is called de-airing and can be accomplished by a machine called a vacuum pug or manually by wedging. Wedging can also help produce an even moisture content. Once a clay body has been kneaded and de-aired or wedged, it is shaped by a variety of techniques. After shaping it is dried and then fired.\n\nIn ceramics, the making of liquid mud (called slip) is a stage in the process of refinement of the materials, since larger particles will settle from the liquid.\n\nMud can provide a home for numerous types of animals, including varieties of worms, frogs, snails, clams, and crayfish. Other animals, such as hippopotamuses, pigs, rhinoceroses, water buffalo and elephants, bathe in mud in order to cool off and protect themselves from the sun. Submerged mud can be home to larvae of various insects.\n\nMud plays an important role in the marine ecosystem. The activities of burrowing animals and fish have a dramatic churning effect on muddy seabeds. This allows the exchange and cycling of oxygen, nutrients, and minerals between water and sediment.\n\nBelow the surface, the burrows of some species form intricate lattice-like networks and may penetrate a meter or more downwards. This means that the burrowed mud is a productive habitat, providing food and shelter for a wide range of mud-dwellers and other animals that forage in and over the mud.\n\nMud can pose problems for motor traffic when moisture is present, because every vehicle function that changes direction or speed relies on friction between the tires and the road surface, so a layer of mud on the surface of the road or tires can cause the vehicle to hydroplane.\n\nHeavy rainfall, snowmelt, or high levels of ground water may trigger a movement of soil or sediments, possibly causing mudslides, landslides, avalanches, or sinkholes.\n\nMudslides in volcanic terrain (called lahars) occur after eruptions as rain remobilizes loose ash deposits.\n\nMudslides are also common in the western United States during El Niño years due to prolonged rainfall.\n\nThere are numerous dysphemisms for poor-tasting food such as \"tastes like dirt\". Kava tea is often described this way, as it is bitter, brown, and contains sediments. \n\nThere also exist children's recipes for \"mud\", which is generally a chocolate or cornstarch-based sludge used more for visual appeal than actual taste. Never does this confectionery mud actually contain real mud.\n\nThe practice of eating earth or soil-like substances is geophagia.\n\nA mud bath is a bath of mud, commonly from areas where hot spring water can combine with volcanic ash. Mud baths have existed for thousands of years, and can be found now in high-end spas in many countries of the world.\n\nMud wallows are a common source of entertainment for kids. Mud wallows can be any shape, size, depth and some can have water as well as mud. Usually wallows are shallow dips in the ground that have been flooded and were full of dirt and those two have mixed to make a squishy mud wallow.\n\nMud bogging is a form of off-road motorsport popular in Canada and the United States in which the goal is to drive a vehicle through a pit of mud or a track of a set length. Winners are determined by the distance traveled through the pit. However, if several vehicles are able to travel the entire length, the time taken to traverse the pit will determine the winner.\n\nMud runs are a popular activity involving mud. Participants run a distance of 3 miles to as long as 10 miles, while crawling through mud bogs, and battling other obstacles.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44597", "title": "National parks of Scotland", "text": "National parks of Scotland\n\nThe national parks of Scotland are managed areas of outstanding landscape where some forms of development are restricted to preserve the landscape and natural environment. At present, Scotland has two national parks: Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, created in 2002, and the Cairngorms National Park, created in 2003.\n\nUnlike the national parks of many other countries, the national parks of Scotland are not areas of uninhabited land owned by the state. The majority of the land is in the ownership of private landowners (including conservation bodies such as the National Trust for Scotland), and people continue to live and work in the parks. Although the landscapes often appear \"wild\" in character, the land is not wilderness, as it has been worked by humans for thousands of years. Like their English and Welsh counterparts the national parks of Scotland are effectively \"managed landscapes\", and are classified as IUCN Category V Protected Landscapes because of this. National parks are only one of a number of designations used to protect and conserve the landscape and natural environment of Scotland.\n\nPublic acccess to all land in Scotland is governed by the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, which grants the public a right of responsible access to most land (and water) for activities such as walking, camping, cycling, canoeing, swimming and climbing; this right applies to land regardless of ownership or whether or not it is in a national park, providing it is exercised responsibly (as defined by the Scottish Outdoor Access Code).\n\nThe concept of national parks was first proposed in the United States in the 1860s, where national parks were established to protect wilderness areas such as Yosemite. Scottish-born John Muir was early advocate for the preservation of wilderness in the United States, and is acknowledged as a leading figure in the formation of national parks in the US, as well as the conservation movement at large. Many other countries have since gone on to form national parks on the basis of setting aside areas of wilderness. Scotland however, lacks any such areas, as thousands of years of human activity have altered the landscape. Human settlement and activity, including agriculture, historical deforestation, overgrazing by sheep and deer, and extensive 20th century afforestation with introduced tree species (particularly conifers) have resulted in landscapes which are semi-natural.\n\nNonetheless, the idea that areas of wild or remote character should be designated to protect the environment and encourage public access grew in popularity throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1931 a commission headed by Christopher Addison proposed the creation of a national park in the Cairngorms, alongside proposals for parks in England and Wales. Following the second world war, the Labour government passed the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, which led to the creation of 10 national parks in England and Wales between 1951 and 1957. No parks were created in Scotland, however a committee, chaired by Sir Douglas Ramsay, was established to consider the issue of national parks in Scotland. The report, published in 1945 proposed national parks in five areas: Loch Lomond & the Trossachs, the Cairngorms, Glen Coe-Ben Nevis-Black Mount, Wester Ross and Glen Strathfarrar-Glen Affric-Glen Cannich. The government designated these areas as \"National Park Direction Areas\", giving powers for planning decisions taken by local authorities to be reviewed by central government, however the areas were not given full national park status. In 1981 the direction areas were replaced by national scenic areas, of which there are now 40. Although the national scenic area designation provided a degree of additional protection via the planning process, there are no bodies equivalent to a national park authority, and whilst local authorities can produce a management strategy for each one, only the three national scenic areas within Dumfries and Galloway have current management strategies.\n\nA 1974 report by the Countryside Commission for Scotland (CCS) entitled \"A Park System for Scotland\" did not explicitly recommend that national parks be established in Scotland, noting only that the issue would “no doubt continue to be debated”. A further CCS report into protection of the landscape of Scotland, \"The Mountain Areas of Scotland - Conservation and Management\", was published in 1990. It recommended that four areas were under such pressure that they ought to be designated as national parks, each with an independent planning board, in order to retain their heritage value. The four areas identified were similar to those proposed by the Ramsay Committee: Loch Lomond & the Trossachs, the Cairngorms, Glen Coe-Ben Nevis-Black Mount and Wester Ross, although Wester Ross was not considered to require a dedicated planning body.\n\nDespite this long history of recommendations that national parks be established in Scotland, no action was taken until the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999. The two current parks were designated as such under the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, which was one of the first pieces of legislation to be passed by the Parliament. Since the original creation of the first two national parks, no further parks have been created, although the Cairngorms National Park was extended in 2010 to include the highland portion of Perthshire. In 2011 the Scottish Government rejected a proposal to create a national park on the Isle of Harris. In 2013 the Scottish Campaign for National Parks proposed seven areas deemed suitable for national park status:\n\n\nIn September 2016 Roseanna Cunningham, the Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform told the Scottish Parliament that the Government had no plans to designate new national parks in Scotland and instead planned to focus on the two existing national parks. As of 2018, there are active campaigns proposing the creation of national parks in Galloway, and the Scottish Borders. The core of the area proposed for the Borders park is broadly similar to the Cheviot Hills park proposed by the Scottish Campaign for National Parks.\n\nIn June 2005, the Scottish Executive announced their intention to create Scotland’s first coastal and marine national park. Five possible locations for this were considered, however no marine park has been established as of 2018.\n\nEach national park in Scotland is administered by a national park authority. Under the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, national parks in Scotland have four aims:\n\nThe first two of this aims are identical to those included in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 legislation that governs national parks in England and Wales, however the Scottish national parks have two additional aims (3 and 4 above). The general purpose of the national park authority, as defined in the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, is to ensure that these aims are \"collectively achieved ...in a coordinated way\". Although the four aims have equal status, in accordance with the Sandford Principle, the first aim (conservation and enhancement of the natural and cultural heritage) is to be given greater weight when it appears to the park authority that there is irreconcilable conflict with the other aims. \n\nA key function of the authority relates to planning permission: in this respect the two current Scottish parks differ. The Loch Lomond and The Trossachs national park is a full planning authority, exercising powers that would otherwise be exercised by the local authority, whilst the Cairngorms national park has the power to \"call in\" planning decisions from the local authority where they are considered to conflict with the aims of the park. National park authorities are also required to take the responsibility for managing access to the countryside that elsewhere falls to local authorities.\n\nAside from the planning and access function, national parks authorities have considerable flexibility as to how the four aims are achieved. They can, for example, acquire land, make byelaws and management agreements, provide grants, offer advice, and undertake or commission research.\n\nThe national park authority is run by a board, consisting of members elected by the community living with the park, members from the local authorities with areas in the park, and members appointed by the Scottish government. The Cairngorms national Park board has 19 members, whilst the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs national park board has 17 members (see below). \n\n\n"}

{"id": "7129693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7129693", "title": "Nunavut", "text": "Nunavut\n\nNunavut (; ; Inuktitut syllabics ) is the newest, largest, and northernmost territory of Canada. It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, via the \"Nunavut Act\" and the \"Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act\", though the boundaries had been contemplatively drawn in 1993. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to Canada's political map since the incorporation of the province of Newfoundland in 1949.\n\nNunavut comprises a major portion of Northern Canada, and most of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Its vast territory makes it the fifth-largest country subdivision in the world, as well as North America's second-largest (after Greenland). The capital Iqaluit (formerly \"Frobisher Bay\"), on Baffin Island in the east, was chosen by the 1995 capital plebiscite. Other major communities include the regional centres of Rankin Inlet and Cambridge Bay. \n\nNunavut also includes Ellesmere Island to the far north, as well as the eastern and southern portions of Victoria Island in the west and Akimiski Island in James Bay far to the southeast of the rest of the territory. It is Canada's only geo-political region that is not connected to the rest of North America by highway.\n\nNunavut is the largest in area and the second-least populous of Canada's provinces and territories. One of the world's most remote, sparsely settled regions, it has a population of 35,944, mostly Inuit, spread over an area of just over , or slightly smaller than Mexico. Nunavut is also home to the world's northernmost permanently inhabited place, Alert. Eureka, a weather station also on Ellesmere Island, has the lowest average annual temperature of any Canadian weather station.\n\nNunavut means \"our land\" in Inuktitut.\n\nNunavut covers of land and of water in Northern Canada. The territory includes part of the mainland, most of the Arctic Archipelago, and all of the islands in Hudson Bay, James Bay, and Ungava Bay, including the Belcher Islands, all of which belonged to the Northwest Territories from which Nunavut was separated. This makes it the fifth-largest subnational entity (or administrative division) in the world. If Nunavut were a country, it would rank 15th in area.\n\nNunavut has long land borders with the Northwest Territories on the mainland and a few Arctic islands, and with Manitoba to the south of the Nunavut mainland; it also meets Saskatchewan to the southwest at a quadripoint). Through its small satellite territories in the southeast, it has short land borders with Newfoundland and Labrador on Killiniq Island, with Ontario in two locations in James Bay – the larger located west of Akimiski Island, and the smaller around the Albany River near Fafard Island – and with Quebec in many locations, such as near Eastmain and near Inukjuak. It also shares maritime borders with Greenland and the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba.\n\nNunavut's highest point is Barbeau Peak () on Ellesmere Island. The population density is 0.019 persons/km (0.05 persons/sq mi), one of the lowest in the world. By comparison, Greenland has approximately the same area and nearly twice the population.\n\nNunavut experiences a polar climate in most regions, owing to its high latitude and lower continental summertime influence than areas to the west. In more southerly continental areas very cold subarctic climates can be found, due to July being slightly milder than the required .\n\nThe region now known as Nunavut has supported a continuous indigenous population for approximately 4,000 years. Most historians identify the coast of Baffin Island with the \"Helluland\" described in Norse sagas, so it is possible that the inhabitants of the region had occasional contact with Norse sailors.\n\nIn September 2008, researchers reported on the evaluation of existing and newly excavated archaeological remains, including yarn spun from a hare, rats, tally sticks, a carved wooden face mask that depicts Caucasian features, and possible architectural material. The materials were collected in five seasons of excavation at Cape Tanfield. Scholars determined that these provide evidence of European traders and possibly settlers on Baffin Island, not later than 1000 CE (and thus older than or contemporaneous with L'Anse aux Meadows). They seem to indicate prolonged contact, possibly up to 1450. The origin of the Old World contact is unclear; the article states: \"Dating of some yarn and other artifacts, presumed to be left by Vikings on Baffin Island, have produced an age that predates the Vikings by several hundred years. So […] you have to consider the possibility that as remote as it may seem, these finds may represent evidence of contact with Europeans prior to the Vikings' arrival in Greenland.\"\n\nThe written historical accounts of Nunavut begin in 1576, with an account by English explorer Martin Frobisher. While leading an expedition to find the Northwest Passage, Frobisher thought he had discovered gold ore around the body of water now known as Frobisher Bay on the coast of Baffin Island. The ore turned out to be worthless, but Frobisher made the first recorded European contact with the Inuit. Other explorers in search of the elusive Northwest Passage followed in the 17th century, including Henry Hudson, William Baffin and Robert Bylot.\n\nCornwallis and Ellesmere Islands featured in the history of the Cold War in the 1950s. Concerned about the area's strategic geopolitical position, the federal government relocated Inuit from Nunavik (northern Quebec) to Resolute and Grise Fiord. In the unfamiliar and hostile conditions, they faced starvation but were forced to stay. Forty years later, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples issued a report titled \"The High Arctic Relocation: A Report on the 1953–55 Relocation\". The government paid compensation to those affected and their descendants and on August 18, 2010 in Inukjuak, Nunavik, the Honourable John Duncan, PC, MP, previous Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians apologized on behalf of the Government of Canada for the relocation of Inuit to the High Arctic.\n\nDiscussions on dividing the Northwest Territories along ethnic lines began in the 1950s, and legislation to do this was introduced in 1963. After its failure, a federal commission recommended against such a measure.\nIn 1976, as part of the land claims negotiations between the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (then called the \"Inuit Tapirisat of Canada\") and the federal government, the parties discussed division of the Northwest Territories to provide a separate territory for the Inuit. On April 14, 1982, a plebiscite on division was held throughout the Northwest Territories. A majority of the residents voted in favour and the federal government gave a conditional agreement seven months later.\n\nThe land claims agreement was completed in September 1992 and ratified by nearly 85% of the voters in Nunavut in a referendum. On July 9, 1993, the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act and the Nunavut Act were passed by the Canadian Parliament. The transition to establish Nunavut Territory was completed on April 1, 1999. The creation of Nunavut has been followed by growth in the capital, Iqaluit—a modest increase from 5,200 in 2001 to 6,600 in 2011.\n\nAs of the 2016 Canada Census, the population of Nunavut was 35,944, a 12.7% increase from 2011. In 2006, 24,640 people identified themselves as Inuit (83.6% of the total population), 100 as First Nations (0.3%), 130 Métis (0.4%) and 4,410 as non-aboriginal (15.0%).\n\nThe population growth rate of Nunavut has been well above the Canadian average for several decades, mostly due to birth rates significantly higher than the Canadian average—a trend that continues. Between 2011 and 2016, Nunavut had the highest population growth rate of any Canadian province or territory, at a rate of 12.7%. The second-highest was Alberta, with a growth rate of 11.6%.\n\nAlong with the Inuit Language (Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun) sometimes called Inuktut, English and French are also official languages.\n\nIn his 2000 commissioned report (\"Aajiiqatigiingniq Language of Instruction Research Paper\") to the Nunavut Department of Education, Ian Martin of York University stated a \"long-term threat to Inuit languages from English is found everywhere, and current school language policies and practices on language are contributing to that threat\" if Nunavut schools follow the Northwest Territories model. He provided a 20-year language plan to create a \"fully functional bilingual society, in Inuktitut and English\" by 2020. The plan provides different models, including:\n\nOf the 34,960 responses to the census question concerning 'mother tongue' in the 2016 census, the most commonly reported languages were:\n\nAt the time of the census, only English and French were counted as official languages. Figures shown are for single-language responses and the percentage of total single-language responses.\n\nIn the 2016 census it was reported that 2,045 people (5.8%) living in Nunavut had no knowledge of either official language of Canada (English or French). The 2016 census also reported that of the 30,135 Inuit people in Nunavut, 90.7% could speak either Inuktitut or Inuinnaqtun.\n\nThe largest denominations by number of adherents according to the 2001 census were the Anglican Church of Canada with 15,440 (58%); the Roman Catholic Church (Roman Catholic Diocese of Churchill-Hudson Bay) with 6,205 (23%); and Pentecostal with 1,175 (4%). In total, 93% of the population were Christian.\n\nThe economy of Nunavut is Inuit and Territorial Government, mining, oil gas mineral exploration, arts crafts, hunting, fishing, whaling, tourism, transportation, education - Nunavut Arctic College, housing, military and research – new Canadian High Arctic Research Station CHARS in planning for Cambridge Bay and high north Alert Bay Station.\nIqaluit hosts the annual Nunavut Mining Symposium every April, this is a tradeshow that showcases many economic activities on going in Nunavut.\n\nThere are currently three major mines in operation in Nunavut.\n\nAgnico-Eagle Mines Ltd – Meadowbank Division. Meadowbank Gold Mine is an open pit gold mine with an estimated mine life 2010–2020 and employs 680 persons.\nThe second recently opened mine in production is the Mary River Iron Ore mine operated by Baffinland Iron Mines. It is located close to Pond Inlet on North Baffin Island. They produce a high grade direct ship iron ore.\n\nThe most recent mine to open is Doris North or the Hope Bay Mine operated near Hope Bay Aerodrome by TMAC Resource Ltd. This new high grade gold mine is the first in a series of potential mines in gold occurrences all along the Hope Bay greenstone belt.\n\n\n\nNunavut's people rely primarily on diesel fuel to run generators and heat homes, with fossil fuel shipments from southern Canada by plane or boat because there are few to no roads or rail links to the region. There is a government effort to use more renewable energy sources, which is generally supported by the community.\n\nThis support comes from Nunavut feeling the effects of global warming. Former Nunavut Premier Eva Aariak said in 2011, \"Climate change is very much upon us. It is affecting our hunters, the animals, the thinning of the ice is a big concern, as well as erosion from permafrost melting.\" The region is warming about twice as fast as the global average, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nNunavut has a Commissioner appointed by the federal Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs. As in the other territories, the commissioner's role is symbolic and is analogous to that of a Lieutenant-Governor. While the Commissioner is not formally a representative of Canada's head of state, a role roughly analogous to representing The Crown has accrued to the position.\n\nNunavut elects a single member of the House of Commons of Canada. This makes Nunavut the largest electoral district in the world by area.\n\nThe members of the unicameral Legislative Assembly of Nunavut are elected individually; there are no parties and the legislature is consensus-based. The head of government, the premier of Nunavut, is elected by, and from the members of the legislative assembly. On June 14, 2018, Joe Savikataaq was elected as the Premier of Nunavut, after his predecessor Paul Quassa lost a non-confidence motion. Former Premier Paul Okalik set up an advisory council of eleven elders, whose function it is to help incorporate \"Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit\" (Inuit culture and traditional knowledge, often referred to in English as \"IQ\") into the territory's political and governmental decisions.\n\nDue to the territory's small population, and the fact that there are only a few hundred voters in each electoral district, the possibility of two election candidates finishing in an exact tie is significantly higher than in any Canadian province. This has actually happened twice in the five elections to date, with exact ties in Akulliq in the Nunavut general election, 2008 and in Rankin Inlet South in the Nunavut general election, 2013. In such an event, Nunavut's practice is to schedule a follow-up by-election rather than choosing the winning candidate by an arbitrary method. The territory has also had numerous instances where MLAs were directly acclaimed to office as the only person to register their candidacy by the deadline, as well as one instance where a follow-up by-election had to be held due to no candidates registering for the regular election in their district at all.\n\nOwing to Nunavut's vast size, the stated goal of the territorial government has been to decentralize governance beyond the region's capital. Three regions—Kitikmeot, Kivalliq and Qikiqtaaluk/Baffin—are the basis for more localized administration, although they lack autonomous governments of their own.\n\nThe territory has an annual budget of C$700 million, provided almost entirely by the federal government. Former Prime Minister Paul Martin designated support for Northern Canada as one of his priorities in 2004, with an extra $500 million to be divided among the three territories.\n\nIn 2001, the government of New Brunswick collaborated with the federal government and the technology firm SSI Micro to launch Qiniq, a unique network that uses satellite delivery to provide broadband Internet access to 24 communities in Nunavut. As a result, the territory was named one of the world's \"Smart 25 Communities\" in 2006 by the Intelligent Community Forum, a worldwide organization that honours innovation in broadband technologies. The Nunavut Public Library Services, the public library system serving the territory, also provides various information services to the territory.\n\nIn September 2012, Premier Aariak welcomed Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, to Nunavut as part of the events marking the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe Nunavut licence plate was originally created for the Northwest Territories in the 1970s. The plate has long been famous worldwide for its unique design in the shape of a polar bear. Nunavut was licensed by the NWT to use the same licence plate design in 1999 when it became a separate territory, but adopted its own plate design in March 2012 for launch in August 2012—a rectangle that prominently features the northern lights, a polar bear and an inuksuk.\n\nThe flag and the coat of arms of Nunavut were designed by Andrew Karpik from Pangnirtung.\n\nThe indigenous music of Nunavut includes Inuit throat singing and drum-led dancing, along with country music, bluegrass, square dancing, the button accordion and the fiddle, an infusion of European influence.\n\nThe Inuit Broadcasting Corporation is based in Nunavut. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) serves Nunavut through a radio and television production centre in Iqaluit, and a bureau in Rankin Inlet. The territory is also served by two regional weekly newspapers \"Nunatsiaq News\" published by Nortext and \"Nunavut News/North\", published by Northern News Services, who also publish the regional \"Kivalliq News\". Broadband internet is provided by Qiniq and Northwestel through Netkaster.\n\nThe film production company Isuma is based in Igloolik. Co-founded by Zacharias Kunuk and Norman Cohn in 1990, the company produced the 1999 feature \"\", winner of the Caméra d'Or for Best First Feature Film at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. It was the first feature film written, directed, and acted entirely in Inuktitut.\n\nIn November 2006, the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) and the Inuit Broadcasting Corporation announced the start of the Nunavut Animation Lab, offering animation training to Nunavut artists at workshops in Iqaluit, Cape Dorset and Pangnirtung. Films from the Nunavut Animation Lab include Alethea Arnaquq-Baril's 2010 digital animation short \"Lumaajuuq\", winner of the Best Aboriginal Award at the Golden Sheaf Awards and named Best Canadian Short Drama at the imagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival.\n\nIn November 2011, the government of Nunavut and the NFB jointly announced the launch of a DVD and online collection entitled \"Unikkausivut\" (Inuktitut: \"Sharing Our Stories\"), which will make over 100 NFB films by and about Inuit available in Inuktitut, Inuinnaqtun and other Inuit languages, as well as English and French. The Government of Nunavut is distributing \"Unikkausivut\" to every school in the territory.\n\nArtcirq is a collective of Inuit circus performers based in Igloolik. The group has performed around the world, including at the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nSusan Aglukark is an Inuit singer and songwriter. She has released six albums and has won several Juno Awards. She blends the Inuktitut and English languages with contemporary pop music arrangements to tell the stories of her people, the Inuit of Arctic.\n\nOn May 3, 2008, the Kronos Quartet premiered a collaborative piece with Inuit throat singer Tanya Tagaq, entitled \"Nunavut\", based on an Inuit folk story. Tagaq is also known internationally for her collaborations with Icelandic pop star Björk.\n\nJordin John Kudluk Tootoo (Inuktitut syllabics: ᔪᐊᑕᓐ ᑐᑐ; born February 2, 1983 in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada) is a professional ice hockey player with the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL). Although born in Manitoba, Tootoo grew up in Rankin Inlet, where he was taught to skate and play hockey by his father, Barney.\n\nDue to prohibition laws influenced by local and traditional beliefs, Nunavut has a highly regulated alcohol market. It is the last outpost of prohibition in Canada, and it is often easier to obtain firearms than alcohol. Every community in Nunavut has slightly differing regulations, but as a whole it is still very restrictive. Seven communities have bans against alcohol and another 14 have orders being restricted by local committees. Because of these laws, a lucrative bootlegging market has appeared where people mark up the prices of bottles by extraordinary amounts. The RCMP estimate Nunavut's bootleg liquor market rakes in some $10 million a year.\n\nDespite the restrictions, alcohol's availability leads to widespread alcohol related crime. One lawyer estimated some 95% of police calls are alcohol-related. Alcohol is also believed to be a contributing factor to the territory's high rates of violence, suicide, and homicide. A special task force created in 2010 to study and address the territory's increasing alcohol-related problems recommended the government ease alcohol restrictions. With prohibition shown to be highly ineffective historically, it is believed these laws contribute to the territory's widespread social ills. However, many residents are skeptical about the effectiveness of liquor sale liberalization and want to ban it completely. In 2014, Nunavut's government decided to move towards more legalization. A liquor store has opened in Iqaluit, the capital, for the first time in 38 years as of 2017.\n\nNunavut has competed at the Arctic Winter Games and co-hosted the 2002 edition.\n\nHockey Nunavut was founded in 1999 and competes in the Maritime-Hockey North Junior C Championship.\n\n\n Effective November 12, 2008.\n\nTourism\nJournalism\n"}

{"id": "188418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188418", "title": "Overconsumption", "text": "Overconsumption\n\nOverconsumption is a situation where resource use has outpaced the sustainable capacity of the ecosystem. A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to environmental degradation and the eventual loss of resource bases.\n\nGenerally, the discussion of overconsumption parallels that of human overpopulation; that is the more people, the more consumption of raw materials takes place to sustain their lives. But, humanity's overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors besides the raw number of people. Their lifestyle (including overall affluence and resource utilization) and the pollution they generate (including carbon footprint) are equally important. Currently, the inhabitants of the developed nations of the world consume resources at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world, who make up the majority of the human population (7.4 billion people).\n\nHowever, the developing world is a growing market of consumption. These nations are quickly gaining more purchasing power and it is expected that the Global South, which includes cities in Asia, Latin America and Africa, will account for 56% of consumption growth by 2030. This means that consumption rates will plateau for the developed nations and shift more into these developing countries. \n\nThe theory of overpopulation reflects issues of carrying capacity without taking into account per capita consumption, by which developing nations are evaluated to consume more than their land can support. It is expected that world population growth will increase by 41% from 2000 to 2050, reaching a height of 8.9 billion people. On top of the rapid growth expectancy, it will be highly concentrated in the developing nations. This poses issues with inequality of consumption as well. The nations that will come into consumer dominance must abstain from abusing certain forms of consumption, especially energy consumption of CO2. Green parties and the ecology movement often argue that consumption per person, or ecological footprint, is typically lower in poor than in rich nations.\n\nIn understanding the effects of over-consumption, it is pertinent to understand what causes the phenomenon. There is a spectrum of goods and services that the world population constantly consume. These range from food and beverage, clothing and footwear, housing, energy, technology, transportation, education, health and personal care, financial services and other utilities. Each of these require a different resource and once that resource is exploited to a certain point, that qualifies as over consumption. Since the developing nations are rising quickly into the consumer class, it is important to note the trends happening in these nations. According to the World Bank, the highest shares of consumption lie in food and beverage and clothing and footwear. This applies regardless of sector of income. \n\nTwo main factors of why we buy so much and so often is due to planned and perceived obsolescence. This factor of production was introduced first in the United States and it revolves around the design of products and with these methods, the products are intentionally designed to get rid of after a short amount of time. As of 2012, only 1% of goods purchased were still in use after 6 months. This is due to planned and perceived obsolescence. When it is planned, designers create products that will not be able to work after a certain amount of time but they work for enough time to ensure the customers will come back to buy again. Perceived obsolescence comes in a lot with fashion and trends and fueled by advertising and media consumption. Through this technique, consumers are convinced that certain products do not have value anymore because it is out of style, and in order to have value, consumers must buy more up to date styles. Here is where fast fashion was born. \nAs of 2015, the top five consumer markets in the world included the United States, Japan, Germany, China and France. \n\nA fundamental effect of overconsumption is a reduction in the planet's carrying capacity. Excessive unsustainable consumption will exceed the long term carrying capacity of its environment (ecological overshoot) and subsequent resource depletion, environmental degradation and reduced ecosystem health.\n\nLooking at the two largest sectors of over consumption, the fashion and food industries, we can see most of the harmful effects on the Earth starting here. The fashion industry has created a new venue, fast fashion, which in 2013 produced 15.1 million tons of textile waste and of that, 12.8 million tons were thrown out. The United States, being the largest consumer market, deals with excess clothing by exporting it to poorer, developing nations but this solution is not sustainable because the demand will go down as cheap clothing becomes more readily available. Another way of disposal is to throw out into landfills or burn up in incinerators which is the least sustainable disposal solution. \n\nThe food industry is the other largest sector of consumption and studies show that people waste a fifth of food products just through disposal or overconsumption. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization collected data and found that by the time food reaches the consumer, 9% (160 million tons) goes uneaten and 10% is lost to overconsumption - meaning consumers ate more than the calorie intake requirement. Other aspects of losses surrounding dry matter came at each stage in the food system, the highest amount being from livestock production at 43.9%, transportation accounted for 18% and consumer waste accounting for 12.2% loss. When the consumer takes in too much, this not only explains losses in the beginning of the stage at production (and over production) but also lends itself to overconsumption of energy and protein, having harmful effects on the body. \nThe scale of modern life's overconsumption has enabled an overclass to exist, displaying affluenza and obesity . However once again both of these claims are controversial with the latter being correlated to other factors more so than over-consumption. Within the topic of overconsumption there are many other ideas that should be considered in order to find the true cause of it. Some important events that coincide are poverty, population and the development of an area. Overconsumption can also lead to a decline in the economy and financial instability. \n\nIn the long term, these effects can lead to increased conflict over dwindling resources and in the worst case a Malthusian catastrophe. Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute, has said: \"It would take 1.5 Earths to sustain our present level of consumption. Environmentally, the world is in an overshoot mode.\"\n\nAs of 2012, the United States alone was using 30% of the world’s resources and if everyone were to consume at that rate, we would need 3-5 planets to sustain this type of living. Resources are quickly becoming depleted, with about ⅓ already gone. With new consumer markets rising in the developing countries which account for a much higher percent of the world’s population, this number can only rise. \n\nThe Worldwatch Institute said China and India, with their booming economies, along with the United States, are the three planetary forces that are shaping the global biosphere. The State of the World 2005 report said the two countries' high economic growth exposed the reality of severe pollution. The report states that\nThe world's ecological capacity is simply insufficient to satisfy the ambitions of China, India, Japan, Europe and the United States as well as the aspirations of the rest of the world in a sustainable way.\n\nThe idea of overconsumption is also strongly tied to the idea of an ecological footprint. The term “ecological footprint” refers to the “resource accounting framework for measuring human demand on the biosphere.” Currently, China is roughly 11 times lower in per capita footprint, yet has a population that is more than four times the size of the USA. It is estimated that if China developed to the level of the United States that world consumption rates would roughly double. According to Scientific American, one person from China uses 53 times fewer resources than the average American.\n\nA 2018 study published in \"Science\" postulates that meat consumption is set to increase as the result of human population growth and rising affluence, which will increase greenhouse gas emissions and further reduce biodiversity.\n\nThe most obvious solution to the issue of overconsumption is to simply slow the rate at which materials are becoming depleted. Less consumption naturally has negative effects on economies - so instead, countries must look to curb consumption rates while allowing for new industries, such as renewable energy and recycling technologies, to flourish and deflect some of the economic burden. A fundamental shift in the global economy may be necessary in order to account for the current change that is taking place or that will need to take place. Movements and lifestyle choices related to stopping overconsumption include: anti-consumerism, freeganism, green economics, ecological economics, degrowth, frugality, downshifting, simple living, minimalism, and thrifting.\n\nRecent grassroots movements have been coming up with creative ways to decrease the amount of goods we consume. The Freecycle Network is a network of people in one's community that are willing to trade goods for other goods or services. It is a new take on thrifting while still being beneficial to both parties.\nOther researchers and movements such as the Zeitgeist Movement suggest a new socioeconomic model which, through a structural increase of efficiency, collaboration and locality in production as well as effective sharing, increased modularity, sustainability and optimal design of products, are expected to reduce resource-consumption.\nAdded information about overconsumption and excess garbage and its effect on urban communities and the environment. Solutions offered include consumers using market forces to influence businesses towards more sustainable manufacturing and products. \n\n"}
{"id": "25211861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25211861", "title": "Paludification", "text": "Paludification\n\nPaludification is the most common process by which peatlands in the boreal zone are formed. \n\nThe process is characterized by peat initialization on previously drier and vegetated habitats over inorganic soils, with no fully aquatic phase. Thus the paludification process includes a shift from forests, grassland or long exposed bare land to peatland. The initiation of this accumulation of organic matter (i.e. peat), can be controlled by both allogenic (i.e. external to the ecosystem) and autogenic (i.e. internal to the ecosystem) factors. The hydrological balance is critical for the initiation of peat. The hydrological balance can simply be defined as the difference between the incoming and outgoing amount of water (e.g. precipitation minus evapotranspiration and minus runoff). Usually it is considered that factors such as climate, geomorphology, geology and soils control this balance. However, paludification may also be just a result of the local accumulation of peat (i.e. autogenic factor). \n\nThe climate factor has a great influence on the paludification process. The development of a paludified soil requires a positive hydrological balance during the growing season. Therefore, there needs to be a shift in local hydrological conditions. Such a shift could be caused by an increase in water inputs or a decrease in outputs. Human activity such as tree removal, natural or human induced forest fires, increase in precipitation, and podsolization, etc. are processes which could change those in- and outputs. \n\nThe factor geomorphology (and also topography) creates spatial diversity in the hydrological characteristics of the landscape. The flat topography (and thus low slopes) in the two major peatlands in the world, located in the West Siberian Plain and in the Hudson/James Bay Lowlands of Canada respectively, illustrate the significance of this factor.\n\nGeology and soils (i.e. bedrock and texture) play also an important role. When the mineral soil is composed of heavy clay, the soil will act as an impermeable substrate that facilitates water accumulation. \n\nIn the context of forest management, paludification has been studied intensively during the last decade. Especially because of the negative effects paludification has for the boreal forests. In this way that paludification may lead to:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6588067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6588067", "title": "Paper clay", "text": "Paper clay\n\nPaper clay (sometimes referred to as fiberclay) is any clay body to which processed cellulose fiber (paper being the most common) has been added. \n\nEarthenware, terra cotta, stoneware, porcelain and bone china clay bodies can be made into paper clay. The more fiber added to the clay body, the stronger the unfired dry paper clay, but the weaker the fired body. The less fiber added to the clay body, the weaker the unfired dry paper clay, but the stronger the fired body. \n\nConventional soft clay building techniques can be used with soft paper clay. This is because there is no physical difference between soft clay and the same clay as a soft paper clay, except the addition of a small percentage of tiny inert cellulose fibers. However it is recommended to use less fiber in paper clay on the potters wheel, particularly if the leather hard work is to be trimmed on the wheel. Paper clay can be made from left over throwing slip from wheel throwing. It is widely used by potters to repair cracks in dry, conventional clay, as well as dry paper clay.\n\nThinner and taller work can be built with partially dry or completely dry paper clay. Re-wetting paper clay is faster with paper clay than pure clay, as the paper fibres pull water more quickly into the clay body. The damp sections can be then joined. Accelerated drying of paper clay work is possible, and results in less warping and cracking, compared with drying conventional clay. The more fiber in the paper clay, the more rapid the drying with less warping and cracking, and the quicker dry-to-dry joins can be made.\n\nThe firing process for paper clay is similar to firing of conventional clay. The clay still needs to be completely dry before firing so the change of water into steam does not cause the clay to explode. Maximum firing temperatures, firing schedules and types of glaze to use for paper clay, are the same as that used for the specific clay used in the paper clay. Some recommend slightly higher firing temperatures. Because dry paper clay is more porous and has greater tensile strength than dry clay, single glaze firing is possible. Due to its higher dry tensile strength there are less breakages during handing and kiln loading. \n\nReplacing some of the clay with fiber, will reduce the thermal mass of clay, in turn reducing further the energy required to fire the work. Changing to paper clay from conventional clay offers considerable energy, financial and time savings when firing ceramics in educational institutions.\n\nNonconventional clay techniques are now possible after adding processed cellulose fiber to any clay: First, joining dry-to-dry paper clay and dry-to-soft paper clay are the most radical new techniques. Secondly, metal supports and ceramic material may be used within paper clay, with less cracking than conventional clay \n\nA new aesthetic has also emerged from combining paper and clay art traditions. For example, dry paper clay is stronger than the same clay without the fiber, so work can be made thinner, and more delicate. \n\nUsing paper clay require less technical skill than conventional clay, so beginners can focus more on the creative expression of their ideas. For example, handles of soft paper clay can be added to a completely dry paper clay pot without distorting the form. Other forms built with coils no longer need to be correctly joined before drying, instead, after drying the form, paper clay slip may be applied to join the coils and fill any gaps. Breaks and cracks in both dry and fired paper clay work can be repaired with paper clay slip. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "49090922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49090922", "title": "Particulate organic matter", "text": "Particulate organic matter\n\nParticulate organic matter (POM, macroorganic matter, or coarse fraction organic matter) is defined as organic particles such as soil organic matter or other particulates between 0.053 mm and 2 mm in size. Isolated by sieving or filtration, this fraction includes partially decomposed detritus and plant material, pollen, and other materials. When sieving to determine POM content, consistency is crucial because isolated size fractions will depend on the force of agitation.\n\nPOM is readily decomposable, serving many soil functions and providing terrestrial material to water bodies. It is a source of food for both soil organisms and aquatic organisms, and provides nutrients for plants. POM also enhances soil structure leading to increased water infiltration, aeration and resistance to erosion Soil management practices, such as tillage and compost/manure application, alter the POM content of soil and water.\n\nAlong with dissolved organic matter, POM drives the lower aquatic food web by providing energy in the form of carbohydrates, sugars, and other polymers that can be degraded. POM in water bodies is derived from terrestrial inputs (e.g. soil organic matter, leaf litterfall), submerged or floating aquatic vegetation, or autochthonous production of algae. Each source of POM has its own chemical composition that affects its lability, or accessibility to the food web.\n\nThe decomposition of POM provides energy and nutrients. Nutrients not taken up by soil organisms may be available for plant uptake. The amount of nutrients released (mineralized) during decomposition depends on the biological and chemical characteristics of the POM, such as the C:N ratio. In addition to nutrient release, decomposers colonizing POM play a role in improving soil structure. Fungal mycelium entangle soil particles and release sticky, cement-like, polysaccharides into the soil; ultimately forming soil aggregates \n\nSoil POM content is affected by organic inputs and the activity of soil decomposers. The addition of organic materials, such as manure or crop residues, typically results in an increase in POM. Alternatively, repeated tillage or soil disturbance increases the rate of decomposition by exposing soil organisms to oxygen and organic substrates; ultimately, depleting POM. Reduction in POM content is observed when native grasslands are converted to agricultural land. Soil temperature and moisture also affect the rate of POM decomposition. Because POM is a readily available (labile) source of soil nutrients, is a contributor to soil structure, and is highly sensitive to soil management, it is frequently used as an indicator to measure soil quality.\n\nIn poorly-managed soils, particularly on sloped ground, erosion and transport of soil sediment rich in POM can contaminate water bodies. Because POM provides a source of energy and nutrients, rapid build-up of organic matter in water can result in eutrophication. Suspended organic materials can also serve as a potential vector for the pollution of water with fecal bacteria, toxic metals or organic compounds.\n\n"}

It was devised by ornithologist Roger Tory Peterson in 1934 for the first of his series of \"Field Guide\"s (See Peterson Field Guides.) Peterson devised his system \"so that live birds could be identified readily at a distance by their 'field marks' without resorting to the bird-in-hand characters that the early collectors relied on. During the last half century the binocular and the spotting scope have replaced the shotgun.\" As such, it both reflected and contributed to awareness of the emerging early environmental movement.\n\nCreated for use by amateur naturalists and laymen, rather than specialists, the \"Peterson System\" is essentially a pictorial key based upon readily noticed visual impressions rather than on the technical features of interest to scientists. The technique involves patternistic drawings with arrows that pinpoint the key field comparisons between similar species.\n\nSince the first Peterson \"Field Guide\", the system has been expanded to about three dozen volumes in the series as well as being emulated by many other publishers and authors of field guides. It has become the near-universally accepted standard, first in the United States and Europe and then around the world.\n"}

The area has at least 9 mammal, 154 bird (migratory and local), 35 fish, 9 arthropod, 11 rotifer, 9 crustacean and 10 protozoan species, making it biologically diverse.\nThis important ecological zone is located in the Shivalik foothills of the Lower Himalayas and was created in 1952 on the Sutlej River, in the Punjab state of India, by building a head regulator to store and divert water for beneficial uses of irrigation, drinking and industrial water supply. The endangered turtle \"Chitra indica\" and the threatened snake \"Python molurus\" (\"at lower risk\"), as per IUCN Red List, are reported to be resident in the wetland. Considering the wetland’s diverse and rich biodiversity, Ramsar Convention has included Ropar Wetland (listed as Ropar Lake) as one of the Ramsar sites among the 26 sites listed under India, for \"the conservation of global biological diversity and for sustaining human life through the ecological and hydrological functions they perform.\"\n\nThe wetland is a popular tourist attraction for bird watching and boating. A tourism complex called the ‘Pinccasia’ is located within the wetland boundary, which is run by the Punjab Tourism Development Corporation. A boat club is also functioning.\n\nThe wetland is located close to the Rupnagar city, 45 km northwest of Chandigarh City, in Roopnagar and Nawanshahr districts of Punjab. Chandigarh is the nearest airport, which connects to the rest of India.\n\nAn archaeological museum of the Archaeological Survey of India at Ropar has displays of the antiquities unearthed during the excavations of mound in the area along with photographs displaying excavation material. The Museum depicts a sequence of six cultural periods or phases, with some breaks from Harappan times to the present day, found in the 21 metre high ancient mound known as Nalagarh Tibbi overlaying the Shiwalik (also spelt Sivalik) deposition on the left bank of the Satluj River where it emerges into the plains. A deep well with a stone inscription of Emperor Shah Jahan (AD 1627-1658) has been located at the foot of the mound. The excavations have established that advanced civilization similar to the Harappa and Mohenjodaro Civilization prospered in Ropar town, an integral part of the wetland.\nThe wetland area has also a modern history in respect of Anglo - Sikh relations. On 26 October 1831, sitting under the shade of an old ficus tree on the bank of Sutlej River, Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Lord William Bentinck, the British Governor General signed an agreement defining the Anglo - Sikh relations and territories.\n\nThe total area covered by the Wetland is 1365 ha, which includes 800 ha area of the river and the reservoir, 30 ha of forest area named as Sadavarat Forest and 30 ha under marshy plants. The wetland is surrounded by hills in the North West and by plain area in the South and South East. Agricultural crops such as wheat, rice, sugarcane, sorghum etc., are grown in the farm lands in the area surrounding the wetland but the hills have thin vegetation and are exposed to intensive grazing.\n\nClimatically, the drainage area of the wetland falls under semi-arid zone of Punjab with mean annual rainfall of 1518 mm. Initially, in the year 1882, a small headwork was constructed on the right bank of Sutlej River, near Ropar town, to supply water to Sirhind Canal. Subsequently in 1952 a head regulator was constructed to divert water not only to the Bist Doab Canal but also to Sirhind Canal and to the Bhakra Main Canal (upstream of the wetland), for irrigation, industrial and domestic use.\n\nWater quality that determines the health of ecosystem of the wetland was monitored by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) in the year 1998-99. The water quality was reported to be of 'A' category as the river entered into Punjab and deteriorated to 'D' category downstream of Ropar Lake, mainly due to the industrial effluents from a number of factories and industrial units. Further studies on physico-chemical analysis of important parameters, biological estimations as well as pesticide residue analysis have been initiated.\n\nThe wetland is rich in flora and fauna which are categorized below.\n\nA total of 19 species of trees and 14 species of bushes and grasses are recorded. Of these, the tree species are \"Acacia catechu\", \"Ameles modesta\", \"Acacia nilotica\", \"Albizzia lebbek\" \"Azadirachta indica\", \"Bombax ceiba\", \"Cassia fistula\", \"Dalbergia sissoo\", \"Eucalyptus tereticornis\", \"Ficus benghalensis\", \"Ficus religiosa\", \"Mangifera indica\", \"Melia azedarach\", \"Moringa oleifera\", \"Morus indica\", \"Prosopis juliflora\", \"Salix\" (willow), \"Syzygium cumini\" (jambul) and \"Zizyphus jujuba\".\n\nWetland is a major source of fisheries since large species of fishes have been recorded; some of the commercially important ones are: Rohu; Labeo gonius Seerha; Labeo calbasu Kalbans or Dhai; Labeo dero Gid; Labeo dyocheilus (Kunni); Catla catla Thal; Cirrhinus mrigala Mori; Puntius sarana Puthi; Cyprinus carpio communis (common carp); Cyprinus carpio spacularis (Mirror carp); Ceenopharyngodon idelle (grass carp); wallago attu Mali; Aorichthys seenghala Sangarha; Mastacembelus armatus Sam (Tire track eel); Ambasis ranga Shisha Mach; Channa punctatus Dolla (snake headed fish); and Channa striata Curd.\n\nGour species of frogs have been noted.\n\nSeveral species of birds have been recorded including 49 local birds, 11 migratory birds, 3 rare birds and 54 common birds. Some of the rare migratory birds are: golden-backed woodpecker (\"Dinopium benghalense\", crimson-breasted barbet (\"Megalaima haemacephala\") and green barbet (\"Stactolaema olivacea\").\n\nTwo species of tortoise (\"Geoclemys hamiltonii\" and \"Chitra indica\" both endangered), five species of lizards, eleven species of snakes including the threatened \"Python molurus\" or Indian python or ajgar are found in the wetland.\n\nThe food chain in the wetland is basically well balanced as it has both deep water and shallow water characteristics and the ecosystem is stated to be \n\"almost self sufficient and self-regulating.\" A Scientific study of the food chain has brought out the following sequence of facts.\n\nOver the years several adverse impacts on the quality of the wetland have been reported. Some of the important ones which invited remedial actions are:\n\nThe Punjab State Council for Science & Technology has evolved several conservation programmes with support from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoE&F) of the Govt of India. Some of the programmes implemented include mass awareness campaigns and promotion of public participation in the wetland conservation. A few of the measures planned and under various stages of implementation are:\n\n"}

It consists of 9 volumes, the first published in 1977 and the ninth in 1994. The main editor for the first five volumes was Stanley Cramp. Cramp died in 1987 and the subsequent volumes were edited by Duncan Brooks and Christopher Perrins. \"BWP\"'s format and breadth influenced the development of regional avifaunas for other parts of the world, notably \"The Birds of Africa\".\n\nA two-volume \"Concise Edition\" was produced in 1998. Both the full and concise editions were published by Oxford University Press (OUP).\n\nThe boundary used for the region included Iceland, but not Greenland; all of Macaronesia (islands off Portugal and North Africa); North Africa; the northern parts of the Arabian peninsula; Iraq and Kuwait, but not Iran; and Russia west of the Urals. A number of subsequent papers have questioned the appropriateness of this boundary, particularly its southern and southeastern delimitations, among them Martins & Hirschfeld (1994). Martins and Hirschfeld published a more detailed paper in 1998, discussing the boundary in Iran and the Arabian peninsula. They concluded that the mountainous western and northern areas of Iran, and the Arabian peninsula, except for two small enclaves in the south, should be included in the Western Palearctic. Ullman (2000) disagreed with their conclusions regarding the Arabian enclaves, however, arguing that their depauperate avifauna, when compared to species-rich areas in northeast Africa, justified inclusion of the whole of Arabia in the Western Palearctic. Roselaar (2006), analysing the breeding distributions of 1037 passerine bird species in the Palearctic region, and northern parts of the Afrotropical and Oriental regions, also proposed a southern boundary somewhat to the south of that used by \"BWP\". He excluded southernmost parts of Arabia, albeit with a slightly different border to that used by Martins & Hirschfeld.\n\nA journal, \"BWP Update\", was published for a number of years following the completion of \"BWP\".\n\nTwo electronic versions of \"BWP\" have been produced. The first, produced by OUP, suffered from a number of technical problems and customers were offered a refund. The second, known as \"BWP\"i\"\", was produced by BirdGuides Ltd.

{"id": "37696632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37696632", "title": "The Colours of Animals", "text": "The Colours of Animals\n\nThe Colours of Animals is a zoology book written in 1890 by Sir Edward Bagnall Poulton (1856–1943). It was the first substantial textbook to argue the case for Darwinian selection applying to all aspects of animal coloration. The book also pioneered the concept of frequency-dependent selection and introduced the term \"aposematism\".\n\nThe book begins with a brief account of the physical causes of animal coloration. The second chapter gives an overview of the book, describing the various uses of colour in terms of the advantages it can bring through natural selection. The next seven chapters describe camouflage, both in predators and in prey. Methods of camouflage covered include background matching, resemblance to specific objects such as bird droppings, self-decoration with materials from the environment, and the seasonal colour change of arctic animals. Two chapters cover warning colours, including both Batesian mimicry, where the mimic is edible, and Mullerian mimicry, where distasteful species mimic each other. A chapter then looks at how animals combine multiple methods of defence, for instance in the puss moth. Two chapters examine coloration related to sexual selection. Finally Poulton summarizes the subject with a fold-out table including a set of Greek derived words that he invented, of which \"aposematic\" and \"cryptic\" survive in biological usage.\n\n\"The Colours of Animals\" was well received on its publication, although the book's support for sexual selection was criticised by Alfred Russel Wallace, and its Darwinism and critique of Lamarckism were attacked by Edward Drinker Cope. Wallace liked Poulton's experimental work but was critical of his opinions on sexual selection. The Neo-Lamarckian Cope criticised Poulton's support for Darwin but liked the book's many observations of animal coloration. Modern biologists respect Poulton's advocacy of natural selection and sexual selection, despite the lack at the time of an adequate theory of heredity, and his recognition of frequency-dependent selection.\n\n\nPoulton explains in his Preface that\n\nPoulton strongly supports Darwin both on the general theme of natural selection, and on the power of sexual selection in species which are sexually dimorphic (where, usually, the male is showier than the female):\n\nPoulton knew his view was controversial, but believed he was winning the argument:\n\nIn \"The Colours of Animals\", Poulton introduced the concept of frequency-dependent selection (selection based on how abundant a form is) in the context of a polymorphism which he argued would otherwise soon vanish:\n\nThe basic concept of warning coloration (aposematism, like the black and yellow pattern of a wasp) is approached very simply:\n\nIn the next paragraph Poulton ties aposematism to mimicry as follows:\n\nPoulton introduced the term \"aposematism\" with the words:\n\nThe book's structure emphasises the extent to which Poulton, like Darwin, relied on a mass of evidence, mainly from insects, to make his case:\n\nChapter 1 The Physical Cause of Animal Colours.\n\nChapter 2 The Uses of Colour.\n\nChapter 3 Protective Resemblances in Lepidoptera.\n\nChapter 4 Protective Resemblances in Lepidoptera (continued), Dimorphism, Etc.\n\nChapter 5 Protective Resemblances In Vertebrata, Etc.\n\nChapter 6 Aggressive Resemblances — Adventitious Protection.\n\nChapter 7 Variable Protective Resemblance in Vertebrata, Etc.\n\nChapter 8 Variable Protective Resemblance In Insects.\n\nChapter 9 Protective Resemblances in Lepidoptera (continued).\n\nChapter 10 Warning Colours.\n\nChapter 11 Warning Colours (continued).\n\nChapter 12 Protective Mimicry.\n\nChapter 13 Protective and Aggressive Mimicry.\n\nChapter 14 The Combination of Many Methods of Defence.\n\nChapter 15 Colours Produced by Courtship.\n\nChapter 16 Other Theories of Sexual Colouring.\n\nChapter 17 Summary And Classification.\n\nThe co-discoverer of natural selection Alfred Russel Wallace, reviewing Poulton in \"Nature\", was interested by Poulton's observations on thin films producing iridescence: \"In some cases dried insects lose some of their metallic colours, but these reappear when the specimen is dipped in water.\" However, Wallace objected to Poulton's suggestion that arctic birds and mammals are white to reduce heat loss by radiation, for which he argued there was no evidence in favour, while a thicker \"covering, such as actually occurs in all arctic animals\" would reduce heat loss effectively, and could be observed to do so.\n\nWallace was enthusiastic about Poulton's experimental work on how butterfly larvae vary their coloration according to the background, admiring \"a number of ingenious experiments\" in which Poulton illuminated the insects in light of one colour or another, causing reliable colour changes which could not be direct, like photography, but had to be mediated by the animal's nervous system:\n\nIn some cases even the cocoons spun by the larvæ are modified by the surrounding colours; and still more curious changes are effected in the larva itself when ... the same species feeds on several plants having differently-coloured leaves. Even the presence of numerous dark twigs has been shown to cause a corresponding change of colour in the larva of the peppered moth (\"Amphidasis betularia\").\"\n\nWallace's main criticism, occupying half his lengthy review, was of Poulton's acceptance of sexual selection. He begins by stating \"Mr. Poulton fully accepts Darwin's theory of female choice as the source of the greater part of the brilliant colour, delicate patterns, and ornamental appendages that exist among animals, and especially among birds and insects.\" Wallace then cites Poulton on the courtship behaviour of spiders:\n\n\"'The female always watches the antics of the male intently, but often refuses him in the end, 'even after dancing before her for a long time.' Such observations strongly point towards the existence of female preference based on æsthetic considerations'\"\n\nat once objecting \"To the last four words we demur, as being altogether unproved. Why æsthetic considerations?\" Wallace then spends a whole page attacking Poulton on \"the possession of an 'æsthetic sense' by those creatures in which sexual ornament occurs\". Wallace objects that Poulton asserts the reality of sexual selection with no proof other than mentioning that insects can perceive colour, and that \"a few birds collect bright objects, as in the case of the bower-birds\".\n\nWallace gives a detailed counter-example to refute Poulton's argument, arguing that \"really beautiful combinations of colour and marking\" are found on the sea shells of molluscs \"where sexual selection has certainly not come into play\". To make the point, Wallace lists\n\n\"the cones, cowries, olives, harps, volutes, pectens, and innumerable other molluscan shells; while many of the sea-anemones, and considerable numbers of the caterpillars with warning colours, are equally beautiful.\"\n\nAnd that was not all. Wallace continued:\n\n\"Still more doubtful and more opposed to reasonable probability is the statement that 'our standards of beauty are largely derived from the contemplation of the numerous examples around us, which... have been created by the æsthetic preferences of the insect world'--alluding... to the colours and structures of flowers as being due to the need of attracting insects to fertilize them.\"\n\nThere was, Wallace insisted, \"not a particle of evidence\" of aesthetic preferences in \"an insect's very limited mentality\". The mention of the term aesthetic was \"not scientific\".\n\nAfter so many \"preceding remarks\" against \"the theory of sexual selection\", Wallace concludes that \"The book is well illustrated by numerous excellent woodcuts and a coloured plate\", congratulates Poulton on \"having produced so readable and suggestive a volume\", and on having \"contributed so largely\" by \"his own researches\" into animal coloration.\n\nAn anonymous reviewer in the \"New York Times\" wrote that \"Mr Poulton wishes first of all to put himself right with regard to his attitude to Darwinism\", mentioning that in 1888 he had been cited in the \"Edinburgh Review\" as attacking Darwinism. The reviewer hastens to agree that Poulton is in fact \"ready to combat Wallace, his master, on points wherein that great fellow-laborer with Charles Darwin dissents from the latter's views.\"\n\nAs an example of this, the reviewer mentions Poulton's argument that Wallace must be wrong that \"the coloring whereby the sexes often differ one from the other in a startling way is occasioned by a surplus vitality\" because \"sexual colors are only developed in species which court by day or twilight\" and then only on parts of the body which the female \"would oftenest and best see them\".\n\nThe New York Times reviewer argued that the title should have been less general \"for readers are sure to demand too much from so comprehensive a term\", given that Poulton refers mainly to insects rather than \"wild beasts\", but in the end he agreed \"that Mr. Poulton has written a very suggestive treatise, well fitted for the general reader\".\n\nThe Neo-Lamarckian Edward Drinker Cope, reviewing the book for the \"American Naturalist\", writes that \"Mr. Poulton supports his own theory of the direct physiological value of the uses of colour to animals by a large amount of experimental evidence brought together from many sources\". Cope is attracted by \"a detail of great interest\" in a caterpillar's camouflage \"by the semblance of a small hole to indicate piercing by insect larvae\" (ichneumon flies, since they avoid caterpillars that are already parasitised), and is impressed by Poulton's observations of \"perhaps the most perfect concealment attained by any butterfly\" in the dead leaf butterfly \"Kallima\", first described by Alfred Russel Wallace.\n\nWhile admiring of Poulton's detailed observations, Cope is critical of his support for Darwin, arguing that Poulton fails to explain how the variability that natural selection needs to work on actually arises. (The mechanisms of mutation and genetics were not to become adequately understood until the twentieth century rediscovery of Mendel's work.)\n\nCope also objects to Poulton's critique of Lamarckism, where in a footnote he cites S.B.J. Skertchly as writing that \"other butterflies \"noticed this immunity [and] copied it\", to which Cope replies as that \"even the American Neo-Lamarckians [like Cope] do not follow their founder so far as to believe that the volition of an animal could account for all the details of mimetic resemblance.\"\n\n\"Science\" reviewed the book in November 1890. The reviewer remarks that \"It is impossible in this brief notice to do full justice to the wealth of interesting examples with which the author presents us\", and notes that unlike the \"hackneyed\" examples of mimicry and camouflage in other textbooks, \"Many of the observations are original.\" The reviewer remarks, also, on the \"decided antithesis between warning and protective colors\", animals being either \"as conspicuous as possible\", or as cryptic as possible, while the conspicuous ones \"are usually accompanied by a nauseating taste, strongly smelling or irritant fluids, etc.\"\n\nThe reviewer notes more critically that additional examples of mimicry might have been given, such as of Hymenoptera (bees and wasps) mimicked by Diptera (flies), and would have liked fuller treatment of Bates's \"South American heliconids and pierids\". The reviewer finds the closing chapters on \"colors used in courtship\" the most interesting of the book, since zoologists disagreed widely on the subject, and notes that Poulton sided with Darwin and against Wallace \"who denies that the so-called secondary sexual characters\" can \"owe their origin to sexual selection\". The reviewer, siding with Poulton, writes that \"It would be difficult, we believe, to explain many of the facts cited by Poulton, notably Peckham's observations on the courtship of spiders, from Wallace's standpoint.\" The review ends with a brief discussion of Poulton's table classifying animal coloration, predicting (correctly) that the \"Greek derivatives\" such as pseudaposematic and pseudepisematic will not be generally adopted.\n\nThe \"British Medical Journal\" reviewed the book in July 1890. The review begins by noting that the pre-Darwinian view of colour \"to-day appears almost ridiculous\", adding that \"we now know\" that colour is of benefit to the animal, and is subject to natural selection. The reviewer writes that it is among Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) that \"protective resemblance or 'cryptic coloration' is most beautifully illustrated, and the book teems with instances\" of these, noting that Poulton had \"made this part of the subject his own\". The review quotes examples including the twig larvae of the Brimstone moth and the \"terrifying attitude\" of the Puss moth caterpillar.\n\nThe reviewer, noting Wallace's different opinion, has no difficulty with Poulton's view of sexual selection, that it is \"due to an aesthetic sense in the [female] animals\", and likes Poulton's expression that \"Natural Selection is a qualifying examination which must be passed by all candidates for honours; Sexual Selection is an honours examination in which many who have passed the previous examination will be rejected.\" The review objects to the \"thick type headings to the subdivision of chapters\" which it finds too much like \"the 'new journalism'\". It concludes by urging readers to compare the book with Darwin's \"Descent of Man\" and with Wallace's \"Darwinism\".\n\nPoulton was a staunch supporter of Darwin, through a period when there was no adequate theory of heredity and both natural selection and sexual selection had become unpopular among scientists, and was attacked for his support both in \"The Colours of Animals\" and outside it. And he is recognised as the first scientist to identify frequency-dependent selection, as described in this book. By 1919, the book was being described in \"Nature\" as a classic work.\n\nPoulton is paid homage by J.A. Allen and B.C. Clarke for his pioneering work on frequency-dependent selection \"by predators acting on non-mimetic polymorphic prey (i.e. for apostatic selection), anticipating many of the points made by later workers. We draw attention to his remarkable insight.\"\n\nThe \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" comments that Poulton's book \"concisely and simply explained the many forms of coloration in terms of natural selection; these forms he ingeniously summarized in a comparative table introducing terms which became the standard nomenclature.\"\n\nIn her book \"The Ant and the Peacock: Altruism and Sexual Selection from Darwin to Today\", the Darwinian philosopher and rationalist Helena Cronin writes that in \"The Colours of Animals\", Poulton defended Darwin's theory of sexual selection, stressing the role of female choice. She suggests that while people have therefore taken Poulton for a staunch Darwinist and supporter of sexual selection, he \"lost his initial enthusiasm for the theory\" and \"came to relegate it to a very minor position\" in evolution. She writes that Poulton's position was highly influential, stating that later \"Darwinian experts on coloration\" followed his views, citing Frank Evers Beddard's 1892 \"Animal Coloration\" as evidence.\n\nIn his Introduction to Hugh Bamford Cott's 1940 book \"Adaptive Coloration in Animals\", Julian Huxley praised Cott's work as \"a worthy successor to Sir Edward Poulton's \"The Colours of Animals\"... The one was a pioneer study, the other is in many respects the last word on the subject\"\".\n\n\n\n"}

Richmond's immigrant population is the highest of any city in Canada. More than half of these immigrants are of Asian descent. The boardwalk was designed to resemble the choreography of the Dragon Dance, a performance frequently used in Chinese festivals. The Nitobe Memorial Garden and Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Chinese Garden, both in Vancouver, were important inspirations for paths, ponds and framing of the garden's landscape. The boardwalk was designed to encourage people to linger and view the \n\ngarden.\n\nThe pond collects rainwater from the Oval's roof and surrounding landscape. It is then purified and re-circulated to be used to irrigate the plants in the surrounding space, provide clean water for the Oval, and empty into the adjacent Fraser River. Aeration for the pond is provided by a fountain on the South side of the garden.\n\nThe \"sky lanterns\" are made of ultraviolet-resistant PTFE fiber nets, supported by painted galvanized steel rings. At night, the lanterns are lit with submerged lights, and the boardwalk is lit with LED spotlights. The eastern lantern is 75 ft. at its largest diameter, and the netting is 25 ft. deep. The northern lantern is 52 ft. at its largest diameter. Its net is 25 ft. deep with a 14 ft. tail that descends to the pond below. The garden was designed so that participants can both look at and look through the netted sculptures without obstructing the view of the Oval building or the surrounding garden area.\n\nThe initial design process began with the creation of a three-dimensional computer model created using custom software. Those forms were then translated into CAD software in order to define the geometry and surfaces of the sculpture. These digital structures were then exported to a gravity and wind simulator in order to determine the necessary twine tenacity to withstand strong winds. From this information, construction drawings are created which include specific looming patterns, color information, and lengths of meshes.\n\n"}

Purification of the body and clothes is called \"taharah\".\n\nThe Qur'an says \"For God loves those who turn to Him constantly and He loves those who keep themselves pure and clean.\" In regard to Muslims being required to be clean when handling and reading the Qur'an, the Qur'an says \"Which none shall touch but those who are clean.\" The Islamic prophet Muhammad said that \"Cleanliness is half of faith\".\n\n\n\nThere are four \"fard\" (obligatory) acts. If one of these acts is omitted, it must be returned to and then the succeeding acts completed.\n\nThere are other acts that are performed during wuḍūʾ (coming from the \"sunnah\" of Islamic prophet Muhammad and Sunni Islamic scholars) and the detailed acts of the wuḍūʾ can be classed into 3 types:\n\nAccording to Sunni Muslims, the Qur'anic mandate for wuḍūʾ comes in the sixth \"ayat\" of \"sura\" 5. The ayat has been translated by Muhammad Muhsin Khan, Rashad Khalifa, Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Pickthal and Maulana Muhammad Ali as follows. Note that these scholars' translation refer to washing the feet.\n\n\nAccording to Shia Muslims the Qur'anic mandate for wuḍūʾ comes in the sixth ayat of sura 5. The ayat has been translated by Muhammad Habib Shakir as follows. Note this scholars translation refers to wiping the feet.\n\n\nA handful of \"mustahabb\" (recommended) acts that are considered to make the wuḍūʾ better. If one of these acts is omitted, the wuḍūʾ is still considered valid.\n\n\nMuslims who are unable to perform the prevailing form of ablution, due to skin disease, a disability or lack of clean water, etc. are recommended to perform \"tayammum\", sometimes called \"dry ablution\", using sand or dust instead of water. Such an alternative form of ritual purity may also be accepted in cases where one fears the acquisition of hypothermia in cold weather.\n\nSunni Muslims perform the following:\n\n\nTheoretically, one can perform one wuḍūʾ for salaat and this wuḍūʾ would be considered valid for the rest of the day. However, traditionally Muslims believe that certain acts invalidate the wuḍūʾ (often referred to as \"breaking wuḍūʾ\" and \"losing wuḍūʾ\") and these can be stated generically thus, although the Quran does not explain most of these:\n\n\nTayammum is a \"dry ablution\" using clean soil or dust, to be performed when water is not readily available to perform ablution or when one is defiled (on \"janabah\") and could not perform \"ghusl\", and is authorised under specific circumstances.\n\nwuḍūʾ in Hadith Abu Hurayra, in reference to the Day of Resurrection, reported that Muhammad, when asked if he would be able to recognise Muslims, said, \"Yes, you would have a mark which other people will not have. You would come to me with a white blaze on your foreheads and white marks on your feet because of the traces of ablution.\"\n\nAbu Hurayra said, \"I have heard prophet (may peace be upon him) say. In a believer adornment would reach the places where ablution reaches.\"\n\nUthman ibn Affan stated that Muhammad, said, \"He who performed ablution well, his sins would come out from his body, even coming out from under his nails.\"\n\n'Umar ibn al-Khattab reported that Muhammad said, \"No one among you does wuḍūʾ and does wuḍūʾ thoroughly – or adequately – and then testifies, 'There is no god but Allah Alone with no partner and I testify that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger', without the eight doors of the Garden being opened to him so that he can enter by whichever of them he wishes.\"\n\n"}
