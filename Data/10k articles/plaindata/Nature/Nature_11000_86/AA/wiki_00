{"id": "1251492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1251492", "title": "Animated mapping", "text": "Animated mapping\n\nAnimated mapping is the application of animation, either computer or video, to add a temporal component to a map displaying change in some dimension. Most commonly the change is shown over time, generally at a greatly changed scale (either much faster than real time or much slower). An example would be the animation produced after the 2004 tsunami showing how the waves spread across the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe concept of animated maps began in the 1930s, but did not become more developed by cartographers until the 1950s (Slocum et al. 2005). In 1959, Norman Thrower published \"Animated Cartography\", discussing the use of animated maps in adding a new dimension that was difficult to express in static maps: time. These early maps were created by drawing \"snap-shots\" of static maps, putting a series of maps together to form a scene and creating animation through photography tricks (Thrower 1959). Such early maps rarely had an associated scale, legends or oriented themselves to lines of longitude or latitude (Campbell and Egbert 1990).\n\nWith the development of computers in the 1960s and 1970s, animation programs were developed allowing the growth of animation in mapping. Waldo Tobler created one of the first animations, using a 3-D computer generated map to portray population growth over a specified time in Detroit (Tobler 1970). Hal Moellering created another animated map in 1976 representing a spatiotemporal pattern in traffic accidents (Slocum et al. 2005).\n\nFurther development in animated map was stalled until the 1990s due to a lack of animation in academics, financial restrictions on research, and lack of distribution means (Campbell and Egbert 1990). In the 1990s, however, the invention of faster, more efficient computers, compact discs and the Internet solved such problems.\n\nWith the growth of animated mapping came the development of guidelines for creating animated maps. Visual variables such as spacing, lightness and shape used for static maps apply. However, in 1991, David DiBiase and colleagues developed visual variables unique to animated maps: duration, rate of change and order. Duration is the unit of time a frame or scene is displayed, affecting the smoothness of the animation. The shorter a frame is displayed, the smoother the animation will appear (Slocum et al. 2005). Smoothness of animation is also a function of the rate of change (Slocum et al. 2005). Order refers to the time sequence in which animation is played out, usually presented in chronological sequence (Slocum et al. 2005). Alan MacEachren extended these visual variables in 1995 to include display date (time at which change is initiated), frequency (number of times identifiable forms are displayed) and synchronization (correspondence of 2 or more time series) (Slocum et al. 2005).\n\nAnimated maps can emphasize the existence of an occurrence at a location, emphasize an attribute of an occurrence or representing change in the position or attributes of an occurrence (DiBiase 1992). For instance, a flashing symbol may be used to draw the map-reader’s attention to a particular occurrence at one location or multiple location across the map. Maps on the weather channel use animation to emphasize current and predicted paths of hurricanes.\n\nThe use of the Internet has allowed animated maps to become interactive. The user can witness representations of changes over time, while manipulating the direction of view, the pace or the parameters of the map displayed (MacEachren 1998).\n\nAnimation on Maps can be mainly divided into two types:\n\nTemporal Animation: Temporal shows the ongoing gradual changes over time. Temporal maps can also be termed as animated timeline maps and can be a useful reference to examine the changes ongoing on each step and analyze the progression occurring gradually as time passes.\n\nThere are many purposes which temporal animation might serve to depict: displaying and analyzing geographic patterns, meteorological events, climate, natural disasters, and other multivariate data.\n\n\"Importance of Legend in Temporal Maps:\"\nAs in the case of static maps, it would be useful if temporal maps could also be provided with proper legend. Legends for temporal maps should not only tell the time but also let user travel over the time. Various manipulations such as traveling to a certain point in time, selecting focus level etc. should be allowed to enhance user friendliness.\n\nUsing legend in temporal map will answer important questions related to the entity’s existence (if?), the entity’s location (when?), time intervals (how long?), temporal texture (how often), speed at which change takes place (how fast?), and the order of change (what order?) (MacEachren, 1995).\n\nDepending upon their construction, animated legends may distract the viewer from the animated map. Care must be taken to integrate the legend in an unobtrusive fashion.\n\nNon-Temporal Animation: Non-Temporal Animation shows changes against some other variables other than time. The variable might be place, position, generalization level etc. Non –temporal animation also serves when there is a need to show both the data set and the transformation that has been applied on it for its display.\n\nNon- temporal animation can be of many types according to the purpose they serve:\n\n1) Fly through animation: \nThis type of animation gives the viewer the feeling of flying through the landscape.\n\n2) Cartographic zoom animation: \nThis type of animation shows maps at different focus level and viewer can change the scale of the map as desired.\n\n3) Classification animation: \nDifferent methods of data classification are depicted in this animation.\n\n4) Generalization animation: \nThis type of animation uses single classification method with multiple classes of data.\n\nTime is an important aspect in both animations. Real time is depicted in temporal animation and presentation time (time to show the animation) is associated with non-temporal animation.\n\n\n\n"}

For example, in Christianity the liturgical year is an annual cycle, which for some Christian denominations is composed of the \"temporal cycle\" that tracks the events in the life of Christ, and the \"sanctoral cycle\" which tracks the various saint's days. Some Christian churches only observe the \"temporal cycle\".\n\nIn climatology, an annual cycle is the part of a measured quantity's fluctuation that is attributed to Earth's changing position in orbit over the course of the year. Such quantities might be influenced directly (e.g. incoming solar radiation at a point at the surface) or indirectly (e.g. stratospheric westerlies and easterlies over the winter and summer hemispheres, respectively) by orbital position.\n\nMathematically, the climatological annual cycle is commonly estimated from observational data or model output by taking the average of all Januaries, all Februaries, and so forth. If the observational record is long enough and conditions are stationary (i.e. there is no significant long-term trend), a meaningful annual cycle will result that can be used to calculate an anomaly time series.\n"}

They typically have one or more of their natural soil horizons modified, removed or replaced. The word anthroposol is derived from the Greek words \"anthropos\", meaning man and \"genes\" meaning caused. Anthroposols are typically found on industrial, commercial, urban and resources extraction sites as well as throughout transportation, fuel and power corridors. \n\nSoil classification systems are used globally to systematically categorize soils based on diagnostic features or characteristics. Human-formed soils have historically been excluded from soil classification systems due in part to the fact that the criteria used for naturally-formed soils are often not applicable. However, many countries are recognizing their pervasiveness and the need for some type of common language and taxonomy. As of 2016, fifteen countries had added (or proposed adding) anthropogenic soils to their soil classification systems including Brazil, Germany, Canada, Poland and China. \n\nThey are known by many terms including: \"Plaggen soils, Paddy soils, Oasis soils, Terra Preta do Indio\" (Brazil), \"Agrozems\" (Russia), \"Terrestriche anthropogene Böden\" (Germany), \"Anthroposols\" (Australia and Canada) and \"Anthrosols\" (China). \n\nThe World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) offers some guidelines for classification. This system is based on a large scale and is not meant to replace national or local systems but rather to facilitate communication between them. The FAO World Soil Resources Report 2006 offers full details. It outlines two larger anthropogenic sub-categories based on the degree of disturbance as well as the pervasiveness of the artifacts within: \n\n\nEach country varies slightly in their diagnostic features and taxonomic structure for soil classification systems as local needs and soil-forming processes are highly variable. \n\nFirst implemented in 1995, three sub groups are included: \n\n\nThere are two broader categories within the framework of anthropogenically modified and technogenically disturbed: \n\n\nArtificial ground is the term used for anthropogenic soils and is given four classes: \n\n\nAs outlined by Naeth et al. (2012) \"Anthroposols are azonal soils, highly modified or constructed by human activity, with one or more natural horizons removed, removed and replaced, added to, or significantly modified.\" The defining features of Anthroposols are:\n\n\nA depth of anthropogenic disturbance (of either modification or addition) must be of at least 10 cm above or below the soil surface for a soil to be categorized as an Anthroposol. Minimal disturbance would likely still allow the natural soil formation process to be identified. \n\nTilled soils are not included in the proposed Anthroposolic order within the Canadian System of Soil Classification and this disturbance is covered by use of suffix p to indicate a plowed horizon within other soil orders. Anthroposols; however, can occur on agricultural soils when substantial disturbance goes beyond typical tillage (e.g., land levelling that alters natural soil profiles through excavation and burial, pipeline or well construction). \n\nSince Anthroposolic soils are commonly developed by human activity with anthropogenic materials, this precludes these soils from classification in the existing classification categories. The first problem is identification of the order for the modified or reconstructed soil, since the existing classification system is applicable only for soils that have been forming under natural conditions. The second problem is determining the most likely trajectory soil development would take. \n\nProposed categorization within the Canadian System of Soil Classification. \n\nAnthroposol - \"soil that has been visibly disturbed by human activity and that have a D horizon [equal to or greater than] 10 cm thick or have had natural soil horizons removed.\"\n\n\n\nSuffixes are used to highlight features of the particular soil. New ones are being created for the anthroposol order, a few examples are: \n\n\nField testing is currently being done on the new Anthroposol classification system for the Canadian soil classification system. \n"}

Since 23 March 2017 he is a member of the House of Representatives. He previously served in the House from 1993 to 1994, and from 2012 to 2015. In the latter three years he also served as leader of GroenLinks. He is an Envoy of the Netherlands for human migration since 20 October 2015.\n\nVan Ojik comes from the Political Party of Radicals, one of the four parties that merged to form GroenLinks in 1989. Van Ojik had been member of the PPR since 1973. Between 1972 and 1980 Van Ojik studied economics at the Free University. He specialized in development economics. Between 1978 and 1981, he served on the board for radical education. As a conscientious objector, Van Ojik did his alternative service at the development organization NIO. After that he worked for the scientific bureau of the PPR until 1983. Here he wrote a book on basic income. In 1986 he co-authored the PPR's election program. Between 1985 and 1988, he was editor-in-chief of the PPR party paper. Between 1988 and 1990 he was party chair of the PPR. As chair of the PPR, he was involved in the negotiations over the formation of GroenLinks, a new political party formed by the merger of the Pacifist Socialist Party, Communist Party of Netherlands, and Evangelical People's Party. Van Ojik had always favoured cooperation between the four parties, but the PPR party board soon wanted to abandon negotiations. Van Ojik had to defend this, although he did not support it. The formal PPR delegation was replaced by an informal delegation by former party chair Wim de Boer. In 1989 the talks led to the formation of a new party. Van Ojik became a member of the first party board. In addition to these activities, Van Ojik freelance journalist and advisor on the subject of development cooperation. Between 1990 and 1993 Van Ojik worked for Oxfam NOVIB.\n\nBetween 1993 and 1994, Van Ojik was member of the House of Representatives for GroenLinks. He replaced PPR member Ria Beckers. He spoke on agriculture, development cooperation and science. He prepared an initiative to limit the use of wood from the tropics. It was finally proposed in 1994 by Marijke Vos. At the 1994 election Van Ojik was put on the seventh place of the GroenLinks list, the same place he had in 1989. GroenLinks only won five seats. He also co-authored the GroenLinks election program.\n\nIn 1997 Van Ojik again co-authored GroenLinks election program for the 1998 election.\n\nFor GroenLinks, Van Ojik chaired a committee which evaluated the municipal elections (2006), parliamentary (2006) and provincial (2007), all of which GroenLinks had lost. Then he became chair of the committee which oversaw a debate within GroenLinks on the party's principles, strategy and organizations. This led to a new manifesto of principles in 2008 of which Van Ojik is one of the co-authors.\n\nAfter national elections on 12 September 2012 the size of the representation of the GroenLinks party within the House of Representatives was reduced from 10 seats to 4 seats. On 8 October 2012 Van Ojik became leader in the House of Representatives for GroenLinks; some days earlier his predecessor Jolande Sap was forced to step down as leader in the House of Representatives for GroenLinks by the board of the GroenLinks party.\n\nAfter not being re-elected for the Dutch House of Representatives, Van Ojik worked for the environmental organization MilieuDefensie between 1994 and 1997. In 1995 he co-authored a book on corals together with Labour Party politician Max van den Berg. In 1997 Van Ojik switched to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he became director of public communication on development cooperation. In 1998 he again co-authored a book with Van der Berg, now on development cooperation. In 2001 Van Ojik became ambassador in general service. He organized external contacts for the Dutch Minister for Development Cooperation. In 2003 Van Ojik became the Dutch ambassador to Benin. In 2006 he returned to the Netherlands to become director of the inspection for evaluation of development cooperation policy of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He also helped the government prepare policy to meet the millennium goals for the fourth Balkenende cabinet.\n\nOn 12 May 2015 his resignation as Leader of GroenLinks and as member of parliament was announced. Jesse Klaver took over his role as leader of the party, while Rik Grashoff took up Van Ojik's seat in parliament on 20 May 2015.\n\nAfter the 2017 general election Van Ojik returned to the House, taking office on 23 March 2017.\n\n\n\n \n"}

The topography of the terrain is either flat or sloped. The surface of these bugyals is covered with natural green grass and seasonal flowers. They are used by tribal herdsmen to graze their cattle. During the winter season the alpine meadows remain snow-covered. During summer months, the Bugyals present a riot of beautiful flowers and grass. As bugyals constitute very fragile ecosystems, particular attention needs to be given for their conservation.\n\nSome of the notable bugyals are: Auli near Joshimath, Garsi, Kwanri, Bedni, Panwali and Kush Kalyan, Dayara and Munsiyari.\n\nAuli Bugyal in Chamoli district, a highland pasture in the Garhwal Himalaya is known as the \"Heaven Terrace\". It lies in an elevation range of with ski slopes located at an elevation of . On either side of the bugyal there are coniferous, oak and deodar forests which limits the wind velocity to acceptable for skiing. It is in the backdrop of Nanda Devi (), Kamet (), Mana Peak (), Dunagiri (), Hathi Parbat (), Bethantoli () and Ghora Parbat peaks of the Himalayas. The trek to Auli passes through lush vegetation of apple orchards and oak forest. The ski slopes are said to better than those at Gulmarg. During the winter months (January to March) the slopes are covered with a mantle of snow which is spread over a width of , and has a thickness . It is a skiing resort with modern skiing equipment. It is the venue of skiing festivities and the annual national championship of skiing held during February and March. It is away from Joshimath. A ski-lift system exists here which is believed to be the longest cable car () from Joshimath to the top most station at Gorson. It is the only location where artificial snow making system is provided to ensure that snow is present on the slopes for skiing. There are also two snow beaters which are used to make the snow slopes fit for skiing. As it is a winter sports centre and Vayudoot two airports have been planned in the region. R. V. Vernede, the British Deputy High Commissioner of the district during the British Raj had built a hut known as “Vernede” here at an elevation of . It is under the control of the Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam Limited, which also provides for all skiing gear at site.\n\nAuli Bugyal is a very large alpine meadow which has expanse of grass land that covers several hundred acres of land, towards the sides of a wide ridge; Bedni Bugyal lies beyond this ridge. The meadows have vegetation of anemones, \"Potentilla\", lousewort, wild \"Salvia\" and thistles. Grazing by cattle and sheep is extensive. There are many trails that pass through the meadows.\n\nMeadows of the Bedni Bugyal in Chamoil district, are at an elevation of . Alpine camps are established here for the pilgrims to visit the Rup Kund ('Kund' meaning \"lake\"), which is covered with snow for 10 months in a year. From this camp to its west, views of the Himalayan peaks of the Gangotri, the Trishul and the Nanda Ghunti provide a scenic backdrop. This budyal also has a small lake called Bedini Kund. It is an artificial lake built with a concrete dyke by reclaiming a marshy wetland. There are two shrines here, one a small temple of Nanda Devi and the other a shrine for Latu. The temple is built with stones without using any mortar but moss growth is seen in the crevices. The Nanda Devi temple has two small carved stone images of the goddess and a pure white conch shell. Bedni and Rup Kund are approached from Karnaprayag. Medicinal herbs are found here.\n\nTunganath Bugyal is at an elevation of and consists of moss cover over soil mantle on rock surface.\n\nDayara Bugyal, in Uttarkashi district, meaning \"high altitude meadow\" is at an elevation of . The beautiful meadows are developed into ski slopes covering an area of . It has also been planned as a skiing resort. It is approached from Uttarkashi, up to village Raithal or village Barsu by road and further by trekking.\n\nOn the Gangorti-Kedarnath trekking route the notable bugyals are Panwali () and Kush-Kalyani. Gorson Bugyal () is near Joshimath. In the alpine meadows of Uttarakhand other bugyals are Rajrambha, Marjhali, Rajthor, Darmithor, Bishanthor, Galpari, Sankalpa, Yangchari, and Shibu Gwar.jerai bugyal in almora district.\n\nBugyal is a fragile ecosystem and it is essential to maintain a balance between ecology and environment. In this context a court case was filed by the public objecting to erection of the prefab houses and by introducing non-biodegradable matter in the upper meadows of the bugyals by the tourism departments. It was averred that the peace and tranquility of the bugyals was getting affected. The court had ordered that the polluter must pay for the damage to environment based on absolute liability principle, which covered payment of damages to the affected people but also to compensate for all costs for restoration of the degraded environments.\n\n"}

{"id": "1097662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1097662", "title": "Flood basalt", "text": "Flood basalt\n\nA flood basalt is the result of a giant volcanic eruption or series of eruptions that covers large stretches of land or the ocean floor with basalt lava. Flood basalt provinces such as the Deccan Traps of India are often called traps, after the Swedish word \"trappa\" (meaning \"stairs\"), due to the characteristic stairstep geomorphology of many associated landscapes. Michael R. Rampino and Richard Stothers (1988) cited eleven distinct flood basalt episodes occurring in the past 250 million years, creating large volcanic provinces, plateaus, and mountain ranges. However, more have been recognized such as the large Ontong Java Plateau, and the Chilcotin Group, though the latter may be linked to the Columbia River Basalt Group. Large igneous provinces have been connected to five mass extinction events, and may be associated with bolide impacts.\n\nThe formation and effects of a flood basalt depend on a range of factors, such as continental configuration, latitude, volume, rate, duration of eruption, style and setting (continental vs. oceanic), the preexisting climate state, and the biota resilience to change.\n\nOne proposed explanation for flood basalts is that they are caused by the combination of continental rifting and its associated decompression melting, in conjunction with a mantle plume also undergoing decompression melting, producing vast quantities of a tholeiitic basaltic magma. These have a very low viscosity, which is why they 'flood' rather than form taller volcanoes. Another explanation is that they result from the release, over a short period, of melt that has accumulated in the mantle over a long period.\n\nThe Deccan Traps of central India, the Siberian Traps, and the Columbia River Plateau of western North America are three regions covered by prehistoric flood basalts. The Mesoproterozoic Mackenzie Large Igneous Province in Canada contains the Coppermine River flood basalts related to the Muskox layered intrusion. The maria on the Moon are additional, even more extensive, flood basalts. Flood basalts on the ocean floor produce oceanic plateaus.\n\nThe surface covered by one eruption can vary from around 200,000 km² (Karoo) to 1,500,000 km² (Siberian Traps). The thickness can vary from 2000 metres (Deccan Traps) to 12,000 m (Lake Superior). These are smaller than the original volumes due to erosion.\n\nFlood basalts have tholeiite and olivine compositions (according to the classification of Yoder and Tilley). The composition of the basalts from the Paraná is fairly typical of that of flood basalts; it contains phenocrysts occupying around 25% of the volume of rock in a fine-grained matrix. These phenocrysts are pyroxenes (augite and pigeonite), plagioclases, opaque crystals such as titanium rich magnetite or ilmenite, and occasionally some olivine. Sometimes more differentiated volcanic products such as andesites, dacites and rhyodacites have been observed, but only in small quantities at the top of former magma chambers.\n\nSubaerial flood basalts can be of two kinds :\nIn the Massif Central in Auvergne, France, there is a good example of chaotic lava flow, produced by eruptions from Puy de la Vache and Puy de Lassolas.\n\nGeochemical analysis of the major oxides reveals a composition close to that of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) but also close to that of ocean island basalts (OIB). These are in fact tholeiites with a silicon dioxide percentage close to 50%.\n\nTwo kinds of basaltic flood basalts can be distinguished :\n\nThe isotopic ratios Sr/Sr and Pb/Pb are different from that observed in general, which shows that the basalt flood magma was contaminated as it passed through the continental crust. It is this contamination that explains the difference between the two kinds of basalt mentioned above. The low phosphorus and titanium type has an excess of elements from the crust such as potassium and strontium.\n\nThe content in incompatible elements of flood basalts is lower than that of ocean island basalts, but higher than that of mid-ocean ridge basalts.\n\nBasalt floods on the planet Venus are larger than those on Earth.\n\nRepresentative continental flood basalts (also known as \"traps\") and oceanic plateaus, arranged by chronological order, together forming a listing of large igneous provinces:\n\n\n"}

Approximately half of the over 140 fountains found in the city form part of the picturesque landscape of the medieval Old Town of Bratislava (the city was known in the past under many names) and serve as tourist attractions while many of the newer fountains are fine examples of socialist era building of modern panelák city suburbs. The number of fountains in Bratislava is comparable to the four times larger neighboring Austrian capital Vienna.\n\nFountains in Bratislava were first built in the 16th century as means of water supply, the oldest fountain in the city is the Roland Fountain from 1572. The first decorative fountain in Bratislava was the Ganymede's Fountain from 1888. The most famous fountain in the city is the Fountain of Love in the borough of Ružinov which was specifically built as the central setting of the 1986 Czechoslovak hit movie Fountain for Suzanne (), directed by Slovak director Dušan Rapoš. The fountain features on the movie's iconic poster. Some fountains (such as the Roland Fountain and the Ganymede's fountain) are part of almost every guided tour of the city, while others (such as the fountain Earth - Planet of peace in front of the Presidential Palace) form part of everyday life in Bratislava and are important meeting points in the city.\n\nDue to Bratislava being in the temperate zone, outdoor fountains are turned off during the winter months. For the city owned fountains the operating season starts in April - May, and the fountains are not turned on en masse, but gradually starting first with the major fountains in the Old Town. The season typically ends in October.\n\nBratislava, due to its location near the river Danube and due to various streams flowing down from the Little Carpathians mountains, always had plenty of water. Fountains were fed water from the streams uphill through a series of wooden pipes, later replaced by metal ones. Since the origin of the stream was higher than the fountain it fed, gravity ejected the water at the end. The pressure was usually very weak and used for example as water flowing from the mouths of animals. During the coronation festivities accompanying the crowning of the Kings of Hungary in the city between 1563 and 1830, wine was usually poured into the town fountains.\n\nOriginally, the project for the tunnel underneath the Bratislava Castle from the 1940s, today used for public transport trams, contained a fountain to be built into the wall of the eastern portal. When looking inside the tunnel, the fountain was supposed to be inside the wall to the right, but this wall was finally constructed shorter and without the fountain. It was supposed to consist of six small half-circle shaped basins arranged into a triangle, with the water cascading from the upper basins into the lower ones.\n\nA new fountain is planned with the reconstruction of the Malokarpatské Námestie in the Lamač borough at least since 2002, but the project is unrealized as of 2012.\n\nThe biggest fountain in Bratislava is \"Fontána Družby\" on Námestie Slobody, Old Town. The smallest fountain is \"Girl with a deer\" on Hviezdoslavovo námestie, Old Town.\n\nAs of today, 42 fountains are taken care of by the municipal company \"Paming - Mestský investor pamiatkovej obnovy\", together with 11 small drinking water fountains and 3 water wells, the rest is owned by the Bratislava city boroughs and various private companies and hotels. Annual budget for running and maintenance of the fountains under \"Paming\" is approximately 150 000 €. Four fountains under \"Paming\" were out of order in the 2010 summer season: fountain on Námestie slobody, fountain on Námestie M. Benku, fountain on Uránová Street and fountain on Borská Street. All four would require reconstruction before being able to function again.\n\nOne fountain, the Fountain for Suzanne in Ružinov, was specially built as the central setting of the 1986 movie of the same name by Slovak director Dušan Rapoš. Fountain for Suzan is still widely known in Slovakia, despite the fountain itself, hidden behind apartment houses, quickly fell into obscurity. Moreover, it was built as a movie prop, without access to public water or electricity. During shooting, the fountain was attached to a cistern truck filled with water. In 2008 the fountain was reconstructed and made functional for the first time.\n\nMany of Bratislava's fountains are tourist attractions, some of them feature in most guided tours. Occasionally, people are fined for swimming or skinny-dipping in the fountains, in most cases foreigners.\n\nDrinking fountains<br>\nThere are currently 33 public drinking water fountains in Bratislava. They started to appear after the practical aspect of fountains diminished. In the past, the city featured a variety of historical drinking fountains, especially wall-fountains inside the courtyards of rich townspeople mansions. Baroque drinking fountains of this type included Putto s rybou I (Putto with a fish I) and Scharitzerova fontána (Scharitzer drinking fountain) inside the Apponyi Palace, Putto s rybou II on Biela Street survived until today.\n\nDrinking fountains are used especially during the summer, yet a lot of people are reluctant to drink the water due to fear of disease. According to the Public Health Office of Slovakia (), all drinking water fountains supply the same tap water as residents have in their homes and the water is safe to drink. Drinking fountains in Bratislava do not feature any instructions on how to operate them.\n\nThe following fountains used to exist in the city in the past:\n\nThe following interior fountains used to exist in the city in the past:\n\nPart of the drinking water fountains is out of order at any given time.\nIn the middle ages, every house in the walled city of Bratislava had a water well, usually several of them, being the main source of water supply. They were built at terrain level but also in the basements of buildings. Wells in Bratislava were suppllied mainly from shallow waters circulating in the Danube river terraces and from three identified streams originating at Kozia Street, Hlboká cesta Street and at the Slavín hill. As of 2011, there were 66 documented wells in the Old Town. 12 are restored and accessible, the well at the courtyard of the Universitas Istropolitana is the oldest. As of today, none of the water wells in Bratislava are actually used and they serve a purely decorative function.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "74204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74204", "title": "Locust", "text": "Locust\n\nLocusts are certain species of short-horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae that have a swarming phase. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances they become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious. No taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions.\n\nIn the solitary phase, these grasshoppers are innocuous, their numbers are low, and they do not pose a major economic threat to agriculture. Under suitable conditions of drought followed by rapid vegetation growth, serotonin in their brains triggers a dramatic set of changes: they start to breed abundantly, becoming gregarious and nomadic (loosely described as migratory) when their populations become dense enough. They form bands of wingless nymphs which later become swarms of winged adults. Both the bands and the swarms move around and rapidly strip fields and cause damage to crops. The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming most of the green vegetation wherever the swarm settles.\n\nLocusts have formed plagues since prehistory. The ancient Egyptians carved them on their tombs and the insects are mentioned in the \"Iliad\", the Bible and the Quran. Swarms have devastated crops and been a contributory cause of famines and human migrations. More recently, changes in agricultural practices and better surveillance of locations where swarms tend to originate, have meant that control measures can be used at an early stage. The traditional means of control are based on the use of insecticides from the ground or the air, but other methods using biological control are proving effective.\n\nSwarming behaviour decreased in the 20th century, but despite modern surveillance and control methods, the potential for swarms to form is still present, and when suitable climatic conditions occur and vigilance lapses, plagues can still occur. Locusts are large insects and convenient for use in research and the study of zoology in the classroom. They are also edible insects; they have been eaten throughout history and are considered a delicacy in many countries. The word \"locust\" is derived from the Vulgar Latin \"locusta\", meaning grasshopper.\n\nLocusts are the swarming phase of certain species of short-horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious.\n\nNo taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions. In English, the term \"locust\" is used for grasshopper species that change morphologically and behaviourally on crowding, forming swarms that develop from bands of immature stages called hoppers.\n\nThese changes are examples of phase polymorphism; they were first analysed and described by Boris Uvarov, who was instrumental in setting up the Anti-Locust Research Centre. He made his discoveries during his studies of the Migratory locust in Caucasus, whose solitary and gregarious phases had previously been thought to be separate species (Locusta migratoria and L. danica L.). He designated the two phases as \"solitaria\" and \"gregaria\". These are also referred to as statary and migratory morphs, though strictly speaking, their swarms are nomadic rather than migratory. Charles Valentine Riley and Norman Criddle were also involved in achieving the understanding and control of locusts.\n\nSwarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The transformation of the locust to the swarming form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. A large swarm can consist of billions of locusts spread out over an area of thousands of square kilometres, with a population of up to 80 million per square kilometre (200 million per square mile). When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release serotonin, which causes them to become mutually attracted, a prerequisite for swarming.\n\nThe initial bands of gregarious hoppers are known as \"outbreaks\", and when these join together into larger groups, the event is known as an \"upsurge\". Continuing agglomerations of upsurges on a regional level originating from a number of entirely separate breeding locations are known as \"plagues\". During outbreaks and the early stages of upsurges, only part of the locust population becomes gregarious, with scattered bands of hoppers spread out over a large area. As time goes by, the insects become more cohesive and the bands become concentrated in a smaller area. In the desert locust plague in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia that lasted from 1966 to 1969, the number of locusts increased from two to 30 billion over two generations, but the area covered decreased from over to .\n\nOne of the greatest differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural. The \"gregaria\" nymphs are attracted to each other, this being seen as early as the second instar. They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like cohesive units and move across the landscape, mostly downhill, but making their way around barriers and merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects seems to be largely visual, but also involves olfactory cues, and the band seem to navigate using the sun. They pause to feed at intervals before resuming their march, and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks.\n\nAlso, differences in morphology and development are seen. In the desert locust and the migratory locust, for example, the \"gregaria\" nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, they grow larger, and have longer developmental periods. The adults are larger with different body proportions, less sexual dimorphism, and higher metabolic rates. They mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier, but have lower levels of fecundity.\n\nThe mutual attraction between individual insects continues into adulthood, and they continue to act as a cohesive group. Individuals that get detached from a swarm fly back into the mass. Others that get left behind after feeding, take off to rejoin the swarm when it passes overhead. When individuals at the front of the swarm settle to feed, others fly past overhead and settle in their turn, the whole swarm acting like a rolling unit with an ever-changing leading edge. The locusts spend much time on the ground feeding and resting, moving on when the vegetation is exhausted. They may then fly a considerable distance before settling in a location where transitory rainfall has caused a green flush of new growth.\n\nSeveral species of grasshoppers swarm as locusts in different parts of the world, on all continents except Antarctica and North America: For example, the Australian plague locust (\"Chortoicetes terminifera\") swarms across Australia.\n\nThe desert locust (\"Schistocerca gregaria\") is probably the best known species owing to its wide distribution (North Africa, Middle East, and Indian subcontinent) and its ability to migrate over long distances. A major infestation covered much of western Africa in 2003-4, after unusually heavy rain set up favourable ecological conditions for swarming. The first outbreaks occurred in Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Sudan in 2003. The rain allowed swarms to develop and move north to Morocco and Algeria, threatening croplands. Swarms crossed Africa, appearing in Egypt, Jordan and Israel, the first time in those countries for 50 years. The cost of handling the infestation was put at US$122 million, and the damage to crops at up to $2.5 billion.\n\nThe migratory locust (\"Locusta migratoria\"), sometimes classified into up to 10 subspecies, swarms in Africa, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, but has become rare in Europe. In 2013, the Madagascan form of the migratory locust formed many swarms of over a billion insects, reaching \"plague\" status and covering about half the country by March 2013. \nSpecies such as the Senegalese grasshopper (\"Oedaleus senegalensis\") and the African rice grasshopper (\"Hieroglyphus daganensis\"), both from the Sahel, often display locust-like behaviour and change morphologically on crowding.\n\nNorth America is currently the only continent besides Antarctica without a native locust species. The Rocky Mountain locust was formerly one of the most significant insect pests there, but it became extinct in 1902. In the 1930s, during the Dust Bowl, a second species of North American locust, the High Plains locust (\"Dissosteira longipennis\") reached plague proportions in the American Midwest. Today, the High Plains locust is a rare species and no longer swarms, leaving North America with no swarming locusts.\n\nStudy of literature shows how pervasive plagues of locusts were over the course of history. The insects arrived unexpectedly, often after a change of wind direction or weather, and the consequences were devastating. The Ancient Egyptians carved locusts on tombs in the period 2470 to 2220 BC, and a devastating plague is mentioned in the Book of Exodus in the Bible, as taking place in Egypt around 1446 BC. The \"Iliad\" mentions locusts taking to the wing to escape fire. Plagues of locusts are also mentioned in the Quran. In the ninth century BC, the Chinese authorities appointed anti-locust officers.\n\nAristotle studied locusts and their breeding habits and Livy recorded a devastating plague in Capua in 203 BC. He mentioned human epidemics following locust plagues which he associated with the stench from the putrifying corpses; the linking of human disease outbreaks to locust plagues was widespread. A pestilence in China in 311 AD that killed 98% of the population locally was blamed on locusts, and may have been caused by an increase in numbers of rats (and their fleas) that devoured the locust carcases.\n\nDuring the last two millennia, locust plagues continued to appear at irregular intervals with the main recorded outbreaks of the desert and migratory locusts occurring in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Other species of locusts caused havoc in North and South America, Asia, and Australasia; 173 outbreaks over a period of 1924 years have been recorded in China. The Bombay locust (\"Nomadacris succincta\") was a major pest in India and southeastern Asia in the 18th and 19th centuries, but has seldom swarmed since the last plague in 1908.\n\nThe extinction of the Rocky Mountain locust has been a source of puzzlement. It had swarmed throughout the west of the United States and parts of Canada in the 19th century. Albert's swarm of 1875 was estimated to cover (greater than the area of California) and to weigh 27.5 million tons, with some 12.5 trillion insects. The last specimen was seen alive in Canada in 1902. Recent research suggests the breeding grounds of this insect in the valleys of the Rocky Mountains came under sustained agricultural development during the large influx of gold miners, destroying the underground eggs of the locust. \n\nEarly intervention is a more successful means of dealing with locusts than later action when swarms have already built up. The technology to control locust populations is now available, but the organisational, financial, and political problems may be difficult to overcome. Monitoring is the key to reducing damage, with the early detection and eradication of bands being the objective. Ideally, a sufficient proportion of nomadic bands can be treated with insecticide before the swarming phase is reached. Reaching this objective may be possible in richer countries like Morocco and Saudi Arabia, but neighbouring poorer countries lack the resources and may act as a source of locust swarms that threaten the whole region.\n\nSeveral organisations around the world monitor the threat from locusts. They provide forecasts detailing regions likely to suffer from locust plagues in the near future. In Australia, this service is provided by the Australian Plague Locust Commission. It has been very successful with dealing with developing outbreaks, but has the great advantage of having a defined area to monitor and defend without locust invasions from elsewhere. In Central and Southern Africa, the service is provided by the International Locust Control Organization for Central and Southern Africa. In West and Northwest Africa, the service is co-ordinated by the Food and Agriculture Organization's Commission for Controlling the Desert Locust in the Western Region, and executed by locust control agencies belonging to each country concerned. The FAO also monitors the situation in the Caucasus and Central Asia, where over 25 million hectares of cultivated land are under threat.\n\nHistorically, people could do little to protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, although eating the insects may have been some consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its bioaccumulation in the food chain.\n\nIn years when locust control is needed, the hoppers are targeted early by applying water-based, contact pesticides using tractor-based sprayers. This is effective but slow and labour-intensive, and where possible, spraying concentrated insecticide solutions from aircraft over the insects or the vegetation on which they feed is preferable. The use of ultralow-volume spraying of contact pesticides from aircraft in overlapping swathes is effective against nomadic bands and can be used to treat large areas of land swiftly. Other modern technologies used for planning locust control include GPS, GIS tools, and satellite imagery, and computers provide rapid data management and analysis.\n\nA biological pesticide to control locusts was tested across Africa by a multinational team in 1997. Dried fungal spores of a \"Metarhizium acridum\" sprayed in breeding areas pierce the locust exoskeleton on germination and invade the body cavity, causing death. The fungus is passed from insect to insect and persists in the area, making repeated treatments unnecessary. This approach to locust control was used in Tanzania in 2009 to treat around 10,000 hectares in the Iku-Katavi National Park infested with adult locusts. The outbreak was contained and the elephants, hippopotamuses, and giraffes present in the area were unharmed.\n\nThe ultimate goal in locust control is the use of preventive and proactive methods that disrupt the environment to the least possible extent. This would make agricultural production easier and more secure in the many regions where growing crops is of vital importance to the survival of the local people.\n\nThe locust is large and easy to breed and rear, and is used as an experimental model in research studies. It has been used in evolutionary biology research and to discover to what degree conclusions reached about other organisms, such as the fruit fly (\"Drosophila\") and the housefly (\"Musca\"), are applicable to all insects. It is a suitable school laboratory animal because of its robustness and the ease with which it can be grown and handled.\n\nLocusts are edible insects. Several cultures throughout the world consume insects, and locusts are considered a delicacy and eaten in many African, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries. \nThey have been used as food throughout history.\n\nThey can be cooked in many ways, but are often fried, smoked, or dried.\nThe Bible records that John the Baptist ate locusts and wild honey () while living in the wilderness. Attempts have been made to explain the locusts as some ascetic vegetarian food such as carob beans, but the plain meaning of \"akrides\" is the insects.\n\nThe Torah, although disallowing the use of most insects as food, permits the consumption of certain locusts; specifically, the red, the yellow, the spotted grey, and the white are considered permissible. In Islamic jurisprudence, eating locusts is considered halal. The Islamic prophet, Muhammad, was reported to have eaten locusts during a military raid with his companions.\n\nLocusts are eaten in the Arabian Peninsula, including Saudi Arabia, where consumption of locusts spiked around Ramadan especially in the Al-Qassim Region in 2014, since many Saudis believe they are healthy to eat. The Saudi Ministry of Health warned that pesticides they used against the locusts made them unsafe; and Kuwait. Yemenis also consume locusts, and expressed discontent over governmental plans to use pesticides to control them. ʻAbd al-Salâm Shabînî described a locust recipe from Morocco. 19th century European travellers observed Arabs in Arabia, Egypt, and Morocco selling, cooking, and eating locusts. They reported that in Egypt and Palestine locusts were consumed. They reported that in Palestine, around the River Jordan, in Egypt, in Arabia, and in Morocco that Arabs ate locusts, while Syrian peasants did not eat locusts.\n\nIn the Haouran region, Fellahs who were in poverty and suffered from famine ate locusts after removing the guts and head, while locusts were swallowed wholesale by Bedouins. Syrians, Copts, Greeks, Armenians, and other Christians and Arabs themselves reported that in Arabia locusts were eaten frequently and one Arab described to a European traveler the different types of locusts which were favored as food by Arabs. Persians use the Anti-Arab racial slur \"Arabe malakh-khor\" (, literally Arab locust eater) against Arabs.\n\nLocusts yield about five times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of greenhouse gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7 kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10 kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286 mg of cholesterol.

It is \"one of the main reliability data sources for the oil and gas industry\" and considered \"a unique data source on failure rates, failure mode distribution and repair times for equipment used in the offshore industr[y]. OREDA's original objective was the collection of petroleum industry safety equipment reliability data. The current organization, as a cooperating group of several petroleum and natural gas companies, was established in 1983, and at the same time the scope of OREDA was extended to cover reliability data from a wide range of equipment used in oil and gas exploration and production (E&P). OREDA primarily covers offshore, subsea and topside equipment, but does also include some onshore E&P, and some downstream equipment as well.\n\nThe main objective of the OREDA project is to contribute to an improved safety and cost-effectiveness in design and operation of oil and gas E&P facilities, through collection and analysis of maintenance and operational data, establishment of a high quality reliability database, and exchange of reliability, availability, maintenance and safety (RAMS) technology among the participating companies.\n\nWork on the OREDA project proceeds in phases spanning 2–3 years. Handbooks summarizing the data collected and other work completed are issued regularly.\n\n\n\nAt times companies have left or joined the project, sometimes as the result of name changes or mergers. The following table lists which companies have contributed data to the OREDA project in phases VIII, IX and XII.\nThe OREDA project's Steering Committee consists of one member and one deputy member from each of the participating companies. From these members, a chairperson is elected, and appoints a Project Manager to coordinate activities approved by the steering committee. The Project Manager is also responsible for data quality assurance. Det Norske Veritas (DNV, now called DNV GL), an international certification body and classification society, served as Project Manager during phases I and II and SINTEF (Stiftelsen for INdustriell og TEknisk Forskning; \"Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research\" in English) during phases III–IX, after which DNV GL again took over Project Manager duties.

Access to this data, and to the search and analysis functions of the OREDA software, is restricted to the OREDA member companies, though contractors working with member companies may be granted temporary access.\n\nData are entered by installation and by owner. Each piece of equipment (e.g. a gas turbine) constitutes a single database inventory record, which includes a technical description of the equipment, and of its environmental and operating conditions, along with all associated failure events. Every failure event is given a set of data including failure cause, date, effect, and mode. Corrective and preventive maintenance data are also included.\n\nThe OREDA software handles data acquisition, analysis and collation. Features include advanced data search, automated data transfer, quality checking, reliability analyses, a tailor-made module for subsea data which includes an event-logging tool, and the option to configure user-defined applications. It can also be used to collect internal company data.\n\nThe most current version of the software, released in concert with the 6th edition of the \"OREDA Handbook\", contains an expanded set of equipment classes, including common subsea components, subsea control systems, subsea power cables, subsea pumps, and subsea vessels.\n\nUse of the OREDA database has \"led to significant savings in the development and operation of platforms.\"\n\nOREDA's example has inspired the creation of similar inter-company cooperation projects in related fields, such as the SPARTA (System Performance, Availability and Reliability Trend Analysis) database created by the wind farm industry in the UK.\n"}

It is home to one of the world's oldest petroleum industries, with its first crude oil exports dating back to 1853. Today, the country is one of the major natural gas producers in the Asian continent. Decades of isolation, sanctions, a lack of technical capacity, opaque government policies and insufficient investment has impeded the country's efforts to develop an upstream hydrocarbon sector. Recent but slow political reform has led the international community to ease sanctions on Burma, giving rise to hopes of greater investment and economic growth.\n\nEarly British explorers in Burma discovered a flourishing oil extraction industry in the town of Yenangyaung in 1795. The area had hundreds of hand-dug oil wells under the hereditary control of 24 Burmese families. \n\nBritish Burma exported its first barrel of crude oil in 1853. The London-based Burmah Oil Company (BOC) was established in 1871 and began production in the Yenangyaung field in 1887 and the Chauk field in 1902. BOC enjoyed a monopoly in the sector until 1901, when the American Standard Oil Company launched operations in Burma. Oil supplies largely met the demand of British India. Prior to World War II and the Japanese invasion of Burma, oil production stood at 6.5 million barrels annually. After independence in 1948, Burma continued to be one of the more prosperous nations in Asia due to its petroleum industry and agricultural exports. \n\nIn 1963, the socialist military government led by Ne Win nationalized the sector, causing decades of economic stagnation.\n\nAfter 1989, the military junta began opening up the country to more foreign investment. Shell discovered the Apyauk gas field 50 kilometres northwest of Yangon in 1991.\n\nMyanmar is today primarily a natural gas producer. As of 2015, Myanmar exports gas to Thailand and China. Myanmar had proven gas reserves of 10 trillion cubic feet in 2012, with an annual production capacity of 416 BcF. Oil reserves in 2013 numbered at 50 million barrels, with a production capacity of 21,000 bbl/d. The Yenangyaung oil field continues to be in operation. \n\nThe country has classified 51 onshore blocks and 53 offshore blocks, including 26 deep water blocks, for oil and gas exploration. \n\nThe National Energy Management Committee regulates the sector under the Ministry of Energy. The industry consists of three key state players: \n\n\nMajor international oil companies (IOCs) engaged in Myanmar include Total S.A., the Essar Group, CNOOC, Petronas and Sinopec.\n\nLocal companies such as Parami Energy Group and MPRL are some who are leading players in this field. According to Kwong Weng Yap, Chief Operating Officer of Parami, he said in a speech to the ASEAN community that the Myanmar oil and gas industry requires a clean government and local inclusion for it to be sustainable in the near term.\n\nThe downstream distribution network in Myanmar remains very under-developed.\n\n"}

It is the central part of Cocteau's Orphic Trilogy, which consists of \"The Blood of a Poet\" (1930), \"Orpheus\" (1950) and \"Testament of Orpheus\" (1960).\n\nSet in contemporary Paris, the story of the film is a variation of the classic Greek myth of Orpheus. The picture begins with Orpheus (Marais), a famous poet, visiting the Café des Poètes. At the same time, a Princess (Casares) and Cégeste (), a handsome young poet whom she supports, arrive. The drunken Cégeste starts a brawl. When the police arrive and attempt to take Cégeste into custody, he breaks free and flees, only to be run down by two motorcycle riders. The Princess has the police place Cégeste into her car in order to \"transport him to the hospital\". She also orders Orpheus into the car in order to act as a witness. Once in the car, Orpheus discovers Cégeste is dead and that the Princess is not going to the hospital. Instead, they drive to a chateau (the landscape through the car windows is presented in negative) accompanied by the two motorcycle riders as abstract poetry plays on the radio. This takes the form of seemingly meaningless messages, like those broadcast to the French Resistance from London during the Occupation.\n\nAt the ruined chateau, the Princess reanimates Cégeste into a zombie-like state, and she, Cégeste, and the two motorcycle riders (the Princess' henchmen) disappear into a mirror, leaving Orpheus alone. He wakes in a desolate landscape, where he stumbles on the Princess' chauffeur, Heurtebise (Périer), who has been waiting for Orpheus to arrive. Heurtebise drives Orpheus home where Orpheus' pregnant wife, Eurydice (Marie Déa), a police inspector, and Eurydice's friend Aglaonice, (head of the \"League of Women,\" and apparently in love with Eurydice), discuss Orpheus' mysterious disappearance. When Orpheus comes home, he refuses to explain the details of the previous night despite the questions which linger over the fate of Cégeste, whose body cannot be found. Orpheus invites Heurtebise to live in his house and to store the Rolls in Orpheus' garage, should the Princess return. Eurydice attempts to tell Orpheus that she is with child, but is silenced when he rebuffs her.\n\nWhile Heurtebise falls in love with Eurydice, Orpheus becomes obsessed with listening to the abstract poetry which only comes through the Rolls' radio, and it is revealed that the Princess is apparently Death (or one of the suborders of Death). But note that Cocteau himself commented on such interpretation:\n\n\"Among the misconceptions which have been written about Orphée, I still see Heurtebise described as an angel and the Princess as Death.\nIn the film, there is no Death and no angel. There can be none. Heurtebise is a young Death serving in one of the numerous sub-orders of Death, and the Princess is no more Death than an air hostess is an angel.\nI never touch on dogmas. The region that I depict is a border on life, a no man's land where one hovers between life and death.\"\n\nWhen Eurydice is killed by Death's henchmen, Heurtebise proposes to lead Orpheus through the Zone (depicted as a ruined city – actually the ruins of Saint-Cyr military academy) into the Underworld in order to reclaim her. Orpheus reveals that he may have fallen in love with Death who has visited him in his dreams. Heurtebise asks Orpheus which woman he will betray: Death or Eurydice? Orpheus enters the afterlife by donning a pair of surgical gloves left behind by the Princess after Eurydice's death.\n\nIn the Underworld, Orpheus finds as a plaintiff before a tribunal which interrogates all parties involved in the death of Eurydice. The tribunal declares that Death has illegally claimed Eurydice, and they return Eurydice to life, with one condition: Orpheus may not look upon her for the rest of his life on pain of losing her again. Orpheus agrees and returns home with Eurydice. They are accompanied by Heurtebise, who has been assigned by the tribunal to assist the couple in adapting to their new, restrictive, life together.\n\nEurydice visits the garage where Orpheus constantly listens to the Rolls' radio in search of the unknown poetry. She sits in the backseat. When Orpheus glances at her in the mirror, Eurydice disappears. A mob from the Café des Poètes (stirred to action by Aglaonice) arrives in order to extract vengeance from Orpheus for what they suppose to be his part in the murder of Cégeste. Orpheus confronts them, armed with a pistol given to him by Heurtebise, but is disarmed and shot. Orpheus dies and finds himself in the Underworld. This time, he declares his love to Death who has decided to herself die in order that he might become an \"immortal poet\". The tribunal this time sends Orpheus and Eurydice back to the living world with no memories of the previous events. Orpheus learns that he is to be a father, and his life begins anew. Death and Heurtebise, meanwhile, walk through the ruins of the Underworld towards an unspecified but unpleasant fate.\n\nIn addition to Cocteau's remarks quoted above, he writes further in \"The Art of Cinema\" (1992):\n\n\"The three basic themes of \"Orphée\" are:\n\nThe other themes are a mixture of Orphic and modern myth: for example, cars that talk (the radio receivers in cars).\n\n\"Orphée\" is a realistic film; or, to be more precise, observing Goethe's distinction between reality and truth, a film in which I express a truth peculiar to myself. If that truth is not the spectator's, and if his personality conflicts with mine and rejects it, he accuses me of lying. I am even astonished that so many people can still be penetrated by another's ideas, in a country noted for its individualism.\n\nWhile \"Orphée\" does encounter some lifeless audiences, it also encounters others that are open to my dream and agree to be put to sleep and to dream it with me (accepting the logic by which dreams operate, which is implacable, although it is not governed by our logic).\n\nI am only talking about the mechanics, since \"Orphée\" is not at all a dream in itself: through a wealth of detail similar to that which we find in dreams, it summarizes my way of living and my conception of life.\"\n\nIn 2000, critic Roger Ebert added \"Orpheus\" to his \"Great Films\" list, praising the simple but ingenious special effects, and writing: \"Seeing \"Orpheus\" today is like glimpsing a cinematic realm that has passed completely from the scene. Films are rarely made for purely artistic reasons, experiments are discouraged, and stars as big as Marais are not cast in eccentric remakes of Greek myths. The story in Cocteau's hands becomes unexpectedly complex; we see that it is not simply about love, death and jealousy, but also about how art can seduce the artist away from ordinary human concerns\".\n\nJean-Pierre Aumont says Cocteau wrote the film for him and his then-wife Maria Montez but then decided to make it with other actors.\n\nIn 1993, Philip Glass adapted the film as a stage opera, \"Orphée\", with a libretto by the composer taken directly from Cocteau's screenplay. Jointly commissioned by the American Repertory Theatre and the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the work had its premiere on May 14, 1993, at the American Repertory Theater.\n\nFrancesca Zambello directed the premiere, and the production, closely based on the imagery of the film, was by frequent Glass collaborator Robert Israel. Baritone Eugene Perry originated the role of Orphee, with Wendy Hill as the Princess, Richard Fracker as Heurtebise and Elizabeth Futral as Eurydice.\n\nIn 2007 the opera was revived at Glimmerglass conducted by Anne Manson, and Manson also conducted a recording with the Portland Opera in 2010. \"New York Times\" critic Anthony Tommasini, following a negative review by the paper's Edward Rothstein of the opera's premiere, wrote about the release of the recording, \"14 years after my first hearing, I was swept away by \"Orphée\".\"\n\n"}

The stratigraphy is detected by radio-echo sounding. The Raymond effect arises from the unusual flow properties of ice. It is of importance because it provides field evidence for the flow properties of ice. In addition, it permits dating of changes in ice flow and the establishment of changes in ice thickness. The effect was first predicted by Charles F. Raymond.\n\nIce viscosity is stress-dependent, and in zones where the (deviatoric) stresses are low, the viscosity becomes very high. Near the base of ice-sheets, stress is proportional to the surface slope, at least when averaged over a suitable horizontal distance. At the flow divide, the surface slope is zero, implying that near the base of the ice-sheet, the viscosity increases. This diverts ice flow laterally, and is the cause of the characteristic anticlines, which are in effect draped over the high viscosity area.\n"}

These atoms have a number of peculiar properties including an exaggerated response to electric and magnetic fields, long decay periods and electron wavefunctions that approximate, under some conditions, classical orbits of electrons about the nuclei. The core electrons shield the outer electron from the electric field of the nucleus such that, from a distance, the electric potential looks identical to that experienced by the electron in a hydrogen atom.\n\nIn spite of its shortcomings, the Bohr model of the atom is useful in explaining these properties. Classically, an electron in a circular orbit of radius \"r\", about a hydrogen nucleus of charge +\"e\", obeys Newton's second law:\n\nwhere \"k\" = 1/(4πε).\n\nOrbital momentum is quantized in units of \"ħ\":\n\nCombining these two equations leads to Bohr's expression for the orbital radius in terms of the principal quantum number, \"n\":\n\nIt is now apparent why Rydberg atoms have such peculiar properties: the radius of the orbit scales as \"n\" (the \"n\" = 137 state of hydrogen has an atomic radius ~1 µm) and the geometric cross-section as \"n\". Thus Rydberg atoms are extremely large with loosely bound valence electrons, easily perturbed or ionized by collisions or external fields.\n\nBecause the binding energy of a Rydberg electron is proportional to 1/\"r\" and hence falls off like 1/\"n\", the energy level spacing falls off like 1/\"n\" leading to ever more closely spaced levels converging on the first ionization energy. These closely spaced Rydberg states form what is commonly referred to as the \"Rydberg series\". Figure 2 shows some of the energy levels of the lowest three values of orbital angular momentum in lithium.\n\nThe existence of the Rydberg series was first demonstrated in 1885 when Johann Balmer discovered a simple empirical formula for the wavelengths of light associated with transitions in atomic hydrogen. Three years later, the Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg presented a generalized and more intuitive version of Balmer's formula that came to be known as the Rydberg formula. This formula indicated the existence of an infinite series of ever more closely spaced discrete energy levels converging on a finite limit.\n\nThis series was qualitatively explained in 1913 by Niels Bohr with his semiclassical model of the hydrogen atom in which quantized values of angular momentum lead to the observed discrete energy levels. A full quantitative derivation of the observed spectrum was derived by Wolfgang Pauli in 1926 following development of quantum mechanics by Werner Heisenberg and others.\n\nThe only truly stable state of a hydrogen-like atom is the ground state with \"n\" = 1. The study of Rydberg states requires a reliable technique for exciting ground state atoms to states with a large value of \"n\".\n\nMuch early experimental work on Rydberg atoms relied on the use of collimated beams of fast electrons incident on ground-state atoms. Inelastic scattering processes can use the electron kinetic energy to increase the atoms' internal energy exciting to a broad range of different states including many high-lying Rydberg states,\n\nBecause the electron can retain any arbitrary amount of its initial kinetic energy, this process always results in a population with a broad spread of different energies.\n\nAnother mainstay of early Rydberg atom experiments relied on charge exchange between a beam of ions and a population of neutral atoms of another species, resulting in the formation of a beam of highly excited atoms,\n\nAgain, because the kinetic energy of the interaction can contribute to the final internal energies of the constituents, this technique populates a broad range of energy levels.\n\nThe arrival of tunable dye lasers in the 1970s allowed a much greater level of control over populations of excited atoms. In optical excitation, the incident photon is absorbed by the target atom, absolutely specifying the final state energy. The problem of producing single state, mono-energetic populations of Rydberg atoms thus becomes the somewhat simpler problem of precisely controlling the frequency of the laser output,\n\nThis form of direct optical excitation is generally limited to experiments with the alkali metals, because the ground state binding energy in other species is generally too high to be accessible with most laser systems.\n\nFor atoms with a large valence electron binding energy (equivalent to a large first ionization energy), the excited states of the Rydberg series are inaccessible with conventional laser systems. Initial collisional excitation can make up the energy shortfall allowing optical excitation to be used to select the final state. Although the initial step excites to a broad range of intermediate states, the precision inherent in the optical excitation process means that the laser light only interacts with a specific subset of atoms in a particular state, exciting to the chosen final state.\n\nAn atom in a Rydberg state has a valence electron in a large orbit far from the ion core; in such an orbit, the outermost electron feels an almost hydrogenic, Coulomb potential, \"U\" from a compact ion core consisting of a nucleus with \"Z\" protons and the lower electron shells filled with \"Z\"-1 electrons. An electron in the spherically symmetric Coulomb potential has potential energy:\n\nThe similarity of the effective potential “seen” by the outer electron to the hydrogen potential is a defining characteristic of Rydberg states and explains why the electron wavefunctions approximate to classical orbits in the limit of the correspondence principle. In other words, the electron's orbit resembles the orbit of planets inside a solar system, similar to what was seen in the obsolete but visually useful Bohr and Rutherford models of the atom.\n\nThere are three notable exceptions that can be characterized by the additional term added to the potential energy:\n\n\n\n\nQuantum-mechanically, a state with abnormally high \"n\" refers to an atom in which the valence electron(s) have been excited into a formerly unpopulated electron orbital with higher energy and lower binding energy. In hydrogen the binding energy is given by:\n\nwhere \"Ry\" = 13.6 eV is the Rydberg constant. The low binding energy at high values of \"n\" explains why Rydberg states are susceptible to ionization.\n\nAdditional terms in the potential energy expression for a Rydberg state, on top of the hydrogenic Coulomb potential energy require the introduction of a quantum defect, δ, into the expression for the binding energy:\n\nThe long lifetimes of Rydberg states with high orbital angular momentum can be explained in terms of the overlapping of wavefunctions. The wavefunction of an electron in a high \"l\" state (high angular momentum, “circular orbit”) has very little overlap with the wavefunctions of the inner electrons and hence remains relatively unperturbed.\n\nThe three exceptions to the definition of a Rydberg atom as an atom with a hydrogenic potential, have an alternative, quantum mechanical description that can be characterized by the additional term(s) in the atomic Hamiltonian:\n\n\nThe large separation between the electron and ion-core in a Rydberg atom makes possible an extremely large electric dipole moment, d. There is an energy associated with the presence of an electric dipole in an electric field, F, known in atomic physics as a Stark shift,\n\nDepending on the sign of the projection of the dipole moment onto the local electric field vector, a state may have energy that increases or decreases with field strength (low-field and high-field seeking states respectively). The narrow spacing between adjacent \"n\"-levels in the Rydberg series means that states can approach degeneracy even for relatively modest field strengths. The theoretical field strength at which a crossing would occur assuming no coupling between the states is given by the Inglis-Teller limit,\n\nIn the hydrogen atom, the pure 1/\"r\" Coulomb potential does not couple Stark states from adjacent \"n\"-manifolds resulting in real crossings as shown in figure 5. The presence of additional terms in the potential energy can lead to coupling resulting in avoided crossings as shown for lithium in figure 6.\n\nThe radiative decay lifetimes of atoms in metastable states to the ground state are important to understanding astrophysics observations and tests of the standard model.\n\nThe large sizes and low binding energies of Rydberg atoms lead to a high magnetic susceptibility, formula_14. As diamagnetic effects scale with the area of the orbit and the area is proportional to the radius squared (\"A\" ∝ \"n\"), effects impossible to detect in ground state atoms become obvious in Rydberg atoms, which demonstrate very large diamagnetic shifts.\n\nRydberg atoms exhibit strong electric-dipole coupling of the atoms to electromagnetic fields and has been used to detect radio communications.\n\nRydberg atoms form commonly in plasmas due to the recombination of electrons and positive ions; low energy recombination results in fairly stable Rydberg atoms, while recombination of electrons and positive ions with high kinetic energy often form autoionising Rydberg states. Rydberg atoms’ large sizes and susceptibility to perturbation and ionisation by electric and magnetic fields, are an important factor determining the properties of plasmas.\n\nCondensation of Rydberg atoms forms Rydberg matter, most often observed in form of long-lived clusters. The de-excitation is significantly impeded in Rydberg matter by exchange-correlation effects in the non-uniform electron liquid formed on condensation by the collective valence electrons, which causes extended lifetime of clusters.\n\nIt has been suggested that Rydberg atoms are common in interstellar space and could be observed from earth. Since the density within interstellar gas clouds is many orders of magnitude lower than the best laboratory vacuums attainable on Earth, Rydberg states could persist for long periods of time without being destroyed by collisions.\n\nDue to their large size, Rydberg atoms can exhibit very large electric dipole moments. Calculations using perturbation theory show that this results in strong interactions between two close Rydberg atoms. Coherent control of these interactions combined with their relatively long lifetime makes them a suitable candidate to realize a quantum computer. In 2010 two-qubit gates were achieved experimentally. Strongly interacting Rydberg atoms also feature quantum critical behavior, which makes them interesting to study on their own.\n\nSince 2000's Rydberg atoms research is encompasses broadly three directions: sensing, quantum optics and quantum simulation . High electric dipole moments between Rydberg atomic states are used for radiofrequency and teraherz sensing and imaging, including non-demolition measurements of individual microwave photons. Electromagnetically induced transparency was used in combination with energy level shifts due to interactions between two atoms excited in Rydberg state to provide medium that exhibits strongly nonlinear behavior for at the level of individual optical photons. The tuneable interaction between Rydberg states, enabled also first quantum simulation experiments.\n\nA simple 1/\"r\" potential results in a closed Keplerian elliptical orbit. In the presence of an external electric field Rydberg atoms can obtain very large electric dipole moments making them extremely susceptible to perturbation by the field. Figure 7 shows how application of an external electric field (known in atomic physics as a Stark field) changes the geometry of the potential, dramatically changing the behaviour of the electron. A Coulombic potential does not apply any torque as the force is always antiparallel to the position vector (always pointing along a line running between the electron and the nucleus):\n\nWith the application of a static electric field, the electron feels a continuously changing torque. The resulting trajectory becomes progressively more distorted over time, eventually going through the full range of angular momentum from \"L\" = \"L\", to a straight line \"L\"=0, to the initial orbit in the opposite sense \n\"L\" = -\"L\".\n\nThe time period of the oscillation in angular momentum (the time to complete the trajectory in figure 8), almost exactly matches the quantum mechanically predicted period for the wavefunction to return to its initial state, demonstrating the classical nature of the Rydberg atom.\n\n"}
{"id": "14102628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14102628", "title": "Spontaneous potential", "text": "Spontaneous potential\n\nSpontaneous potential (SP), also called self potential, is a naturally occurring electric potential difference in the Earth, measured by an electrode relative to a fixed reference electrode. Spontaneous potentials are often measured down boreholes for formation evaluation in the oil and gas industry, and they can also be measured along the Earth's surface for mineral exploration or groundwater investigation. The phenomenon and its application to geology was first recognized by Conrad Schlumberger, Marcel Schlumberger, and E.G. Leonardon in 1931, and the first published examples were from Romanian oil fields.\n\nSpontaneous potentials (SP) are usually caused by charge separation in clay or other minerals, due to presence of semi-permeable interface impeding the diffusion of ions through the pore space of rocks, or by natural flow of a conducting fluid through the rocks.\n\nThe origin of SP across formation can be attributed to two processes involving the movement of ions:\n\nStreaming potential originates from the flow of an electrolyte (water) over naturally charged solids (i.e., surfaces that acquired electrokinetic or \"zeta\" potential). The streaming potential appears when mud filtrate is forced into the formation under the differential pressure between mud column and formation. The streaming potential is produced when the flow takes place across mud-cake in front of permeable formations, across permeable formations being invaded, and across shale beds. It is generally accepted that the streaming potential across the mud-cake is compensated by that across the shale. As such, in most cases, the spontaneous potential measured is only related to the electrochemical potential.\n\nElectrochemical potential (\"E\") is the sum of liquid junction or diffusion potential (\"E\"), and membrane potential (\"E\")\n\nLiquid junction potential is established at the direct contact of the mud filtrate and formation water at the edge of the invaded formation. Ions Na and Cl diffuse from either solution to the other, but at different rate due to different mobilities. Na tends to be less mobile due to its affinity for water molecules. \n\nwhere: \n\nMembrane Potential develops when two electrolytes of different ionic concentrations, such as mud and formation water, are separated by shale. The clay minerals in shale are usually made up of atom Al, Si, and O. O ions occupy the outer layer and cause a net negative charge. Na ions from solution are attracted and allowed to pass through the shale, while Cl ions are repelled. Na ions will migrate between the two solutions, with a net influx from the more saline to the less. \n\nwhere: \n\nThe total electrochemical potential is thus summarized as \"E\" = \"E\" + \"E\" = \"K\" log(\"a\"/\"a\")\n\nSince spontaneous potential is a measure of electrochemical potential and the ionic activity of a solution is inversely proportional to its resistivity, the above equation can be simplified as SP = \"E\" = \"K\" log (\"R\"/\"R\"), where \"R\" and \"R\" are equivalent mud filtrate resistivity and equivalent formation water resistivity respectively. \n\nThe ideal spontaneous potential across clean bed is known as Static SP (SSP), and defined as follow:\n\nThe most useful SP component is the electrochemical potential, since it can cause a significant deflection opposite permeable beds. The magnitude of the deflection depends mainly on the salinity contrast between borehole and formation fluid, and the clay content of the permeable bed. The SP log is therefore useful in detecting permeable beds and to estimate formation water salinity and formation clay content. Due to the nature of the electric current, SP can only be recorded in conductive mud.\n\nAs established earlier, static SP is defined as follow:\n\nStatic SP (SSP) can be obtained directly from the SP curve if the bed is clean, thick, porous, permeable, and only moderately invaded. When these conditions are not met, the recorded SP will need to be corrected. Various correction charts are available for this purpose. \n\nTo convert the measured mud filtrate resistivity \"R\" into an equivalent mud filtrate resistivity \"R\", the following rules are employed:\n\nSchlumberger Chart SP-2 can then be used to convert \"R\" to obtain \"R\".\n\nElectrodes can be placed on the ground surface to map relative changes in the SP value (in millivolts, or mV), typically with the goal of identifying the path of groundwater flow in the subsurface, or seepage from an earthen dam. A voltmeter measures the voltage between a fixed liquid-junction electrode and a mobile one (rover), which is moved along a dam face or over an area of investigation to collect multiple readings. Anomalies observed may indicate groundwater movement or seepage.\n\nSP can be affected by several factors that complicates the interpretation. Beside petrochemical component, SP is also affected by electrokinetic potential and bimetallism. Besides, SP is also affected by the following factors:\n\nSpontaneous potential can be measured by placing one probe of a voltmeter at the Earth's surface (called surface electrode) and the other probe in the borehole (called downhole electrode), where the SP is to be measured. In fact, logging tools employ exactly this method. Since this measurement is relatively simple, usually SP downhole electrode is built into other logging tools.\n\n\n\n"}

Streamer discharges can form when an insulating medium (for example air) is exposed to a large potential difference. When the electric field created by the applied voltage is sufficiently large, accelerated electrons strike air molecules with enough energy to knock other electrons off them, ionizing them, and the freed electrons go on to strike more molecules in a chain reaction. These electron avalanches (Townsend discharges) create ionized, electrically conductive regions in the air near the electrode creating the electric field. The space charge created by the electron avalanches gives rise to an additional electric field.\nThis field can enhance the growth of new avalanches in a particular direction.\nThen the ionized region grows quickly in that direction, forming a finger-like discharge called a \"streamer\".\n\nStreamers are transient (exist only for a short time) and filamentary, which makes them different from corona discharges. They are used in applications such as ozone production, air purification or plasma medicine. Streamers pave the way for arcs and lightning leaders, in which the ionized paths created by streamers are heated by large currents. Streamers can also be observed as sprites in the upper atmosphere. Due to the low pressure, sprites are much larger than streamers at ground pressure, see the similarity laws below.\n\nThe theory of streamer discharges was preceded by John Sealy Townsend's discharge theory\nfrom around 1900.\nHowever, it became clear that this theory was sometimes inconsistent with observations.\nThis was especially true for discharges that were longer or at higher pressure.\nIn 1939, Loeb\nand Raether\nindependently described a new type of discharge, based on their experimental observations.\nShortly thereafter, in 1940, Meek presented the \"theory of spark discharge\",\nwhich quantitatively explained the formation of a self-propagating streamer.\nThis new theory of streamer discharges successfully explained the experimental observations.\n\nStreamers are used in applications such as ozone generation, air purification and plasma-assisted combustion.\nAn important property is that the plasma they generate is strongly non-equilibrium: the electrons have much higher energies than the ions.\nTherefore, chemical reactions can be triggered in a gas without heating it.\nThis is important for plasma medicine, where \"plasma bullets\", or guided streamers, can be used for wound treatment, although this is still experimental.\n\nStreamers can emerge when a strong electric field is applied to an insulating material, typically a gas. Streamers can only form in areas where the electric field exceeds the dielectric strength (breakdown field, disruptive field) of the medium. For air at atmospheric pressure, this is roughly 30 kV per centimeter. \nThe electric field accelerates the few electrons and ions that are always present in air, due to natural processes such as cosmic rays, radioactive decay, or photoionization. Ions are much heavier, so they move very slowly compared to electrons.\nAs the electrons move through the medium, they collide with the neutral molecules or atoms.\nImportant collisions are:\nWhen the electric field approaches the breakdown field, the electrons gain enough energy between collisions to ionize the gas atoms, knocking an electron off the atom. At the breakdown field, there is a balance between the production of new electrons (due to impact ionization) and the loss of electrons (due to attachment).\nAbove the breakdown field, the number of electrons starts to grow exponentially, and an electron avalanche (Townsend avalanche) forms.\n\nThe electron avalanches leave behind positive ions, so in time more and more space charge is building up.\n(Of course, the ions move away in time, but this a relatively slow process compared to the avalanche generation).\nEventually, the electric field from all the space charge becomes comparable to the background electric field.\nThis is sometimes referred to as the \"avalanche to streamer transition\".\nIn some regions the total electric field will be smaller than before, but in other regions it will get larger, which is called electric field enhancement.\nNew avalanches predominantly grow in the high-field regions, so a self-propagating structure can emerge: a streamer.\n\nThere are positive and negative streamers.\nNegative streamers propagate against the direction of the electric field, that is, in the same direction as the electrons drift velocity.\nPositive streamers propagate in the opposite direction.\nIn both cases, the streamer channel is electrically neutral, and it is shielded by a thin space charge layer.\nThis leads to an enhanced electric field at the end of the channel, the \"head\" of the streamer.\nBoth positive and negative streamers grow by impact ionization in this high-field region, but the source of electrons is very different.\n\nFor negative streamers, free electrons are accelerated from the channel to the head region.\nHowever, for positive streamers, these free electrons have to come from farther away, as they accelerate into the streamer channel.\nTherefore, negative streamers grow in a more diffuse way than positive streamers.\nBecause a diffuse streamer has less field enhancement, negative streamers require higher electric fields than positive streamers.\nIn nature and in applications, positive streamers are therefore much more common.\n\nAs noted above, an important difference is also that positive streamers need a source of free electrons for their propagation.\nIn many cases photoionization is believed to be this source. In nitrogen-oxygen gas mixtures with high oxygen concentrations, excited nitrogen emits UV photons which subsequently ionize oxygen. In pure nitrogen or in nitrogen with small oxygen admixtures, the dominant production mechanism of photons, however, is the Bremsstrahlung process.\n\nMost processes in a streamer discharge are two-body processes, where an electron collides with a neutral molecule.\nAn important example is impact ionization, where an electron ionizes a neutral molecule.\nTherefore, the mean free path is inversely proportional to the gas number density.\nIf the electric field is changed linearly with the gas number density, then electrons gain on average the same energy between collisions.\nIn other words, if the ratio between electric field formula_1 and number density formula_2 is constant, we expect similar dynamics.\nTypical lengths scale as formula_3, as they are related to the mean free path.\n\nThis also motivates the Townsend unit, which is a physical unit of the formula_4 ratio.\n\nIt has been observed that discharges in laboratory experiments emit X-rays and that lightning discharges emit X-rays and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, bursts of photons with energies of up to 40 MeV. These photons are produced by runaway electrons, electrons which have overcome the friction force, through the Bremsstrahlung process. However, it has not been fully understood how electrons can gain such high energies in the first place since they constantly collide with air molecules and lose energy. A possible explanation is the acceleration of electrons in the enhanced electric fields of the streamer tips. However, it is uncertain whether this process can really explain a sufficiently high production rate. Recently, it has been proposed that ambient air is perturbed in the vicinity of streamer discharges and that this perturbation facilitates the acceleration of electrons into the run-away regime \n"}

{"id": "2988035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2988035", "title": "Vortex engine", "text": "Vortex engine\n\nThe concept of a vortex engine or atmospheric vortex engine (AVE), independently proposed by Norman Louat and Louis M. Michaud, aims to replace large physical chimneys with a vortex of air created by a shorter, less-expensive structure. The AVE induces ground-level vorticity, resulting in a vortex similar to a naturally occurring landspout or waterspout.\nMichaud's patent claims that the main application is that the air flow through the louvers at the base will drive low-speed air turbines (21), generating twenty percent additional electric power from the heat normally wasted by conventional power plants. That is, the vortex engine's proposed main application is as a \"bottoming cycle\" for large power plants that need cooling towers.\n\nThe application proposed by Louat in his patent claims is to provide a less-expensive alternative to a physical solar updraft tower. In this application, the heat is provided by a large area of ground heated by the sun and covered by a transparent surface that traps hot air, in the manner of a greenhouse. A vortex is created by deflecting vanes set at an angle relative to the tangent of the outer radius of the solar collector. Louat estimated that the minimum diameter of the solar collector would need to be 44+ metres in order to collect \"useful energy\". A similar proposal is to eliminate the transparent cover. This scheme would drive the chimney-vortex with warm seawater or warm air from the ambient surface layer of the earth. In this application, the application strongly resembles a dust devil with an air-turbine in the center.\n\nSince 2000, Croatian researcher from the \"Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture\" (University of Split) such as Ninic and Nizetic also work on this technology, publishing paper and patents.\n\nIn operation, the vortex centripetally expels heavier, colder external air (37), and therefore forms a large, low-pressure chimney of hot air (35). It uses about twenty percent of a power-plant's waste heat to drive its air motion. Depending on weather, a large station may create a virtual chimney from 200 m to 15 km high, efficiently venting waste power plant heat into colder upper atmosphere with minimal structure.\n\nThe vortex is begun by briefly turning on a diffuse heater (83) and electrically driving the turbines (21) as fans. This moves mildly heated air into the vortex arena (2). The air must have only a mild temperature difference because large temperature differences increase mixing \nwith cold ambient air and reduce efficiency. The heat might be from flue gases, turbine exhaust or small natural gas heaters.\n\nThe air in the arena rises (35). This draws more air (33, 34) through directing louvers (3, 5), which cause a vortex to form (35). In the early stages, external airflow (31) is restricted as little as possible by opening external louvers (25). Most of the heat energy is at first used to start the vortex.\n\nIn the next stage of start-up, the heater (83) may be turned off and the turbines (21) by-passed by louvers (25). At this time, low-temperature heat from an external powerplant drives the updraft and vortex via a conventional crossway cooling tower (61).\n\nAs the air leaves the louvers (3, 5) more rapidly, the vortex increases in speed. The air's momentum causes centrifugal forces on the air in the vortex, which reduce pressure in the vortex, narrowing it further. Narrowing further increases the vortex speed as conservation of momentum causes it to spin faster. The speed of spin is set by the speed of the air leaving louvers (33, 34) and the width of the arena (2). A wider arena and faster louver speed cause a faster, tighter vortex.\n\nHeated air (33, 34) from the crossway cooling tower (61) enters the concrete vortex arena (2) via two rings of directing louvers (3, 5, height exaggerated for clarity) and rises (35). The upper ring of louvers (5) seals the low-pressure end of the vortex with a thick, relatively high-speed air-curtain (34). This substantially increases the pressure difference between the base of the vortex (33) and the outside air (31). In turn, this increases the efficiency of the power turbines (21).\n\nThe lower ring of louvers (3) convey large masses of air (33) almost directly into the low-pressure end of the vortex. The lower ring of louvers (3) are crucial to get high mass flows, because air from them (33) spins more slowly, and thus has lower centripetal forces and a higher pressure at the vortex.\n\nAir-driven turbines (21) in constrictions at the inlet of the cooling tower (61) drive electric motor-generators. The generators begin to function only in the last stages of start-up, as a strong pressure differential forms between the base of the vortex arena (33) and the outside air (31). At this time, the bypass louvers (25) are closed.\n\nThe wall (1) and bump (85) retain the base of the vortex (35) in ambient winds by shielding the low-velocity air-motion (33) in the base of the arena, and smoothing turbulent airflow. The height of the wall (1) must be five to thirty times the height of the louvers (3, 5) to retain the vortex in normal wind conditions.\n\nTo manage safety and wear of the arena (2), the planned maximum speed of the vortex base (33) is near 3 m/s (10 ft/s). The resulting vortex should resemble a large, slow dust-devil of water-mist more than a violent tornado. In uninhabited areas, faster speeds might be permitted so the vortex can survive in faster ambient winds.\n\nMost of the unnamed numbered items are a system of internal louvers and water pumps to manage air velocities and heating as the engine starts.\n\nIn early studies it was not absolutely clear that this could be made workable due to cross-wind disruption of the vortex.

Martin served as Special Assistant to President Reagan for National Security Affairs, Executive Secretary of the National Security Council in the West Wing of the White House and Deputy Secretary of the Department of Energy during the Ronald Reagan administration. He was President of the Council of the University for Peace, appointed to the Council by Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan. On May 8, 2018 he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star by Emperor Akihito of Japan in a ceremony in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo for his work in strengthening US-Japan cooperation in nuclear energy. \n\nMartin was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He achieved his Bachelor of Science from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1972 and his Master of Science from MIT in 1974. His master's thesis was the basis of an article he co-authored with George Cabot Lodge in the March, 1975 \"Harvard Business Review\" entitled \"Our Society in 1985: Business May Not Like It\".\n\nWilliam F. Martin's official White House government National Security Council files are available in the Ronald Reagan Library archive. \n\nAs a graduate student at MIT, he was part of a team that prepared ten days of Congressional hearings chaired by Congressman John Dingell on \"Growth and Its Implications for the Future\" (Roundtable Press, 1973). The hearings were in response to the Club of Rome's report, \"The Limits to Growth\" and were aimed at providing the first Congressional hearings on the world economic, energy and environmental outlook and the need for sustainable growth strategies. He was also part of an MIT engineering group that produced a volume for the United Nations Environmental Program on resource materials for studies in environmental management. He is co-author of the report, \"Professional Materials for Environmental Management Education\" (MIT Press, 1975). These publications were induced by the first United Nations conference on the environment held in Stockholm in 1972 and headed by Maurice Strong who said of \"Growth and Its Implications for the Future\", \"This small volume summarizes much of the important work going on today with regard to global survival...I know of no other publication to date which emphasizes more systematically or extensively, and in such readable form, the interacting relationships amongst diverse fields.\"\n\nFollowing graduating from MIT, Martin joined the MIT Energy Laboratory as a Program officer for the Workshop on Alternative Energy Strategies (WAES) headed by Professor Carroll L. Wilson, the first General Manager of the US Atomic Energy Commission. This fifteen country energy assessment group, headquartered at MIT, met for three years and produced the report, \"Energy: Global Energy Prospects 1985-2000\" (McGraw-Hill, 1975). Martin was a co-author of the final report and editor of \"Energy Supply to the Year 2000\" (MIT Press, 1977). Martin was responsible for energy supply analysis as well as energy projections of developing nations. He and his co-author Frank J.P. Pinto were responsible for using the SIMLINK model of the World Bank as an economic foundation for projecting energy futures for developing nations. This World Bank-MIT project entitled \"Energy and Economic Growth Prospects for the Developing Countries: 1960-2000\" (MIT Press, 1977). was one of the pioneering research attempts to estimate energy prospects for developing countries.\nMartin then moved to Paris where he was responsible for energy statistics for developing countries at the International Energy Agency Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and was part of a UN expert group that developed the methodology for reporting United Nations energy statistics. The statistics were published in the volumes I and II of the report \"Workshop on Energy Data of Developing Countries\" (IEA/OECD, 1978). Martin was also director of the IEA Workshop on Energy Statistics for Developing Countries that resulted in the first publication of energy statistics for over 100 countries in a matrix supply/demand integration format.\n\nIn 1978, he was promoted to Special Assistant to the Executive Director of the IEA, Ulf Lantzke, and served in this capacity for two years during the time of the Second Oil Shock. At the commencement of the Iran-Iraq war, it was agreed that nations should coordinate their oil stock draws in the event of a major disruption. As the Special Assistant to the IEA Executive Director, Martin served as the coordinator for four IEA Ministerial meetings where he aided in the drafting of several communiques, including the one from 1981 that is the basis of IEA agreements today on coordinated stock draw as well as a key element of the 2009 discussions between Henry Kissinger (the founder of IEA), Nobuo Tanaka (then Executive Director) and Martin on expanding this concept to include China, India and other advancing nations. A letter from Kissinger to Martin recognizing his contribution in this regard can be seen online.\n\nIn 1981, Martin joined the United States Department of State as Special Assistant to Under Secretary of State James L. Buckley who recalled Martin's activities in his book \"Gleanings from an Unplanned Life\". The senior Reagan administration inter-agency \"Buckley Group\" that Martin coordinated sought to reduce European subsidies and credits to the Soviet Union. It also urged Europeans to reduce their dependence on Soviet gas and to find alternatives. Finally, it proposed market oriented energy policies for the United States (deregulation of oil and gas price controls, permitting Alaskan oil exports, allowing eminent domain for coal slurry pipelines) -- all policies of which eventually came to fruition during the Reagan Presidency. (see reference to this again in James Buckley's \"Gleanings from an Unplanned Life\"). Martin briefed President Reagan in the Oval Office that unless the US was credible in its energy policies, the Europeans would not take seriously our concerns on their over dependence on Soviet gas imports.\n\nIn 1982, he was transferred to the National Security Council as the Director of International Economic Affairs. In this capacity he prepared recommendations for the President in the areas of energy security, East-West economic relations, the Iran-Iraq War and Central American economic development. A key responsibility of Martin's was to conceptualize and then negotiate with the Europeans on the issue of reducing their reliance on Soviet natural gas imports, a project that was directed personally by President Reagan. Martin made a key presentation to President Reagan on alternative gas scenarios for Europe, concluding that the Troll field was vital for European security. Martin's role was to negotiate the development of the giant Norwegian Troll gas field to be an alternative to Soviet gas imports and this was documented in the book \"Troll: Gas for Generations\", an excerpt of which can be seen online. This was part of a larger program to undermine the Soviet economy as reported by Peter Schweizer in his book, \"Victory: The Reagan Administration's Secret Strategy that Hastened the Collapse of the Soviet Union \" and the excerpt where he credited Martin for this effort can be seen online.\n\nMartin is also credited in a Presidential citation as the principal draftsman of the \"Williamsburg Declaration\", at the 9th G7 Summit which is a three-page communique agreed to by the G-7 leaders who were Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of the UK, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau of Canada, Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani of Italy and Prime Minister François Mitterrand of France. The President read the three-page declaration before the world press (President Reagan's opening remarks can be seen on online). and credited Martin as the principal draftsman in the following online letter. Many conclude that this jointly agreed document, which argued for free markets and free trade policies, set in place the foundations for a worldwide economic recovery beginning in 1983. Based on these achievements, Martin was appointed Special Assistant to President Reagan, responsible for the coordination of the President's international and head of state meetings.\nMartin helped arrange President Reagan's international meetings coordinating with the White House Advance Office, NSC staff and the Department of State. He participated in the President's visits to Japan (1983), South Korea (1983), China (1984), Ireland (1984), United Kingdom (1984), the D-Day fortieth anniversary commemoration on Normandy beaches in France (1984), Canada (1985), Spain (1985), Germany (1985), EU Parliament (1985), the Reagan-Gorbachev Geneva Summit (1985) and several G-7 economic summit meetings (Williamsburg, London and Bonn). Working closely with the State Department and NSC staff, he also coordinated the preparation of President Reagan's Oval Office head of state meetings. As NSC Senior Director for Coordination, he coordinated and participated in the President's major bilateral meetings with, among others, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan, Shimon Peres of Israel, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, President Ali Saibou of Niger, King Hussein of Jordan, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of the UK, Prime Minister Bettino Craxi of Italy, Prime Minister Kåre Willoch of Norway, Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanond of Thailand, Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa of Sri Lanka, Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko of the USSR, OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye, UN Secretary General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany.\n\nIn addition to general preparations for the President's meeting with the Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, he and Dr. Alvin Trivelpiece were responsible for concluding an agreement with his Russian counterpart Academic Evgeny Velikhov on magnetic fusion cooperation that has since become the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project as recognized in the concluding sentence of the communique of this historic meeting, \"The two leaders emphasized the potential importance of the work aimed at utilizing controlled thermonuclear fusion for peaceful purposes and, in this connection, advocated the widest practicable development of international cooperation in obtaining this source of energy, which is essentially inexhaustible, for the benefit for all mankind\". A letter from Martin to Dr. Trivelpiece recounting this experience can be seen online.\n\nIn preparation for major visits abroad and in the Oval office, as well as visits outside the United States, Martin would sometimes do the first draft of the President's weekly radio address in close coordination with Presidential chief speech writer Ben Elliott. Three of these addresses were especially important. First, Reagan's radio address in 1984 following his first meeting with a Soviet leader (Foreign Minister Gromyko) after four years in office. This widely quoted radio address, highlighted in headlines on the front page of the \"Washington Post\" set the agenda and tone for the subsequent meeting with Soviet leader Gorbachev one year later. Reagan recognized Martin's role in its drafting in the following letter. Second, Martin prepared a radio address describing the G-7 Economic Meeting chaired by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. And third, he prepared a radio address in 1983 describing the President's visit to Japan and Korea. In appreciation for Martin's work on numerous projects, President Reagan commended him in a series of letters on: European gas supplies; the 1983 Williamsburg Summit; the 1984 UN General Assembly; the 1985 Reagan-Gorbachev Geneva Summit; Reagan's 1983 trip to Asia; Reagan's 1984 trip to China; and Martin's tenure as the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council.\n\nMartin served as the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council in the Reagan White House. The Executive Secretary is the head of the NSC as defined by the National Security Act of 1947. In practice, it serves as the NSC's chief of staff responsible for coordination, budget and management of the National Security Council. The Executive Secretary coordinates the National Security Council meetings and manages vital policy and information communication from the Cabinet and the NSC staff to the President. One of the duties of Mr. Martin as Executive Secretary was to oversee the White House Situation Room located in the basement of the West Wing of the White House which is in 24/7 communication with the Department of Defense, State Department, Intelligence Community and US embassies abroad. \n\nAs Executive Secretary, Martin also chaired an Executive Secretary group composed of officials from State, Defense, CIA and the NSC responsible for coordinating the President's national security priorities as identified in a book titled \"National Security Issues of the United States\". Martin developed a system for briefing the President using a six-month national security intelligence, policy and implementation calendar working closely with his inter-agency colleagues Colin Powell and Robert Gates.\nMartin also initiated and coordinated the production of several videos prepared for the President describing Reagan's international visits, objectives and \"scene-setters\" including his visit to China in 1984, his visit to Europe to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of D-Day and a preview of the historic first meeting with Soviet leader Gorbachev in Geneva in 1985, a script of which can be seen online. These videos were presented to the President just before visits to supplement other written and oral presentations.\n\nAt the time of the Iran-Iraq war in 1984, Martin was responsible for the coordination of an NSC Special Situation Group headed by Vice-President Bush on building up the defensive capabilities of friendly Middle Eastern countries and developing a strategy to cope with potential oil market disruptions. The briefing to the President was the culmination of several meetings of the NSC working group, documents of which can be found here: Memo on Internal Paper on Persian Gulf; Memo outlining talking points; Memo to McFarlane on working group; Memo to Clark updating the situation; and cables between President Reagan and British Prime Minister Thatcher on the subject. Martin's role was detailed by Robert C. McFarlane in his book \"Special Trust\", an excerpt of which can be seen online. The plan, approved by the President and Vice President, was an important step in building US military capability in the Gulf resulting in the successful defense of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in the 1991 Gulf War. The plan also stimulated the buildup of the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Martin's now declassified presentation to the President can be seen online.\n\nIn 1985, Martin chaired an NSC inter-agency group on Central American Economic Development. The conclusion of the working group, presented to and approved by the President, was threefold: encourage free market reforms; contribute $8 billion in economic assistance; and encourage continued security in the region. The actual Reagan National Security Study Directive (NSSD) describing these initiatives can be viewed on reaganlibrary.gov. The policy also called upon all US Cabinet officers to assist Central America in its quest for economic development (i.e. agriculture, energy, commerce and transportation). The theme of the presentation was that security assistance in Central America would be enhanced through economic growth and prosperity. Without economic progress, the security situation would continue to unravel. In addition, Martin coordinated a special program transfer Los Alamos National Laboratory \"hot dry rock\" energy technology to Costa Rica. The program laboratory program grew to include laser technology developed in Department of Energy (DOE) labs to evaluate air quality in Mexico City.\n\nDuring the Christmas holiday season in 1985, Mr. Martin was traveling with President Reagan to California as the NSC aide. During this time, there was a terrorist attack on the Rome and Vienna airports, resulting in the deaths of many innocent men, women and children. Martin set up an NSC crisis management center on the site of the Annenberg Estate where the President was staying and kept the President updated with morning, noon and evening meetings. The terrorist was Abu Nidal and the New York Times reported that Martin was handling the terrorist attack for the President. It was learned that Abu Nidal had backing from Libya and a key question for the President was the appropriate response. The President responded that since the attacks were in Rome and Vienna, authorities in those countries should bring the criminals to justice. \"This is not a time to spread violence in the region\", the President told Martin and also told him to tell Israel not to attack Syrian missiles in the Beqaa Valley. Three months later when Americans were killed in the La Belle Discotheque bombing in Berlin, President Reagan responded with an attack on Gaddafi's compound codenamed Operation El Dorado Canyon.\n\nWilliam Martin was also involved in the conceptualization and implementation of the National Program Office. The National Program was established to ensure continuity of the United States government in the even of a nuclear attack. This deterrence system was later adapted following the 9/11 attacks to protect the US government in the event of a hostile terrorist attack.\n\nIn June 1986, Martin was nominated by President Reagan and confirmed by the United States Senate as United States Deputy Secretary of Energy, the number two official of the United States Department of Energy. Martin reported to Secretary of Energy John S. Herrington. The DOE is responsible for the nation's nuclear weapons complex, scientific research and energy policy. At the time of his confirmation, the department had over 150,000 employees and contractors. Martin was awarded the department's highest award by Energy Secretary John S. Herrington for a report he produced, \"Energy Security: Report to the President of the United States\". It was the first comprehensive inter-agency, publicly available study on US energy security and concluded that energy imports would continue to rise and that US must strive for greater energy efficiency and development of clean coal technology, safe nuclear power, natural gas, solar and other renewable technologies, as well as to maintain incentives for environmentally sensitive domestic oil development. Martin testified before the United States Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on the study conclusions. His testimony can be seen online. For this, he was commended by the Democratic Chairman of the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, John Dingell. Martin was also the administration's top energy adviser on the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement that opened up energy markets between the United States and Canada. He was commended for his work as a member of the negotiating team and core member of the Cabinet group that oversaw the negotiations with Canada. Martin's testimony on behalf of the agreement before the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on International Economic Policy, Trade and Western Hemisphere Affairs can be seen online. The full text of these Congressional hearings on the agreement is available online.\nIn 1986, Martin engaged then-Governor and future President Bill Clinton in a debate before the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on the merits of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's powers to set interstate electricity rates. The Senate Committee supported Martin's view, objected to by Clinton, that an electricity holding company, Grand Gulf, could justifiably raise electricity prices in the state of Arkansas due to cost overruns of the Grand Gulf Nuclear Generating Station operating in Mississippi. Though Arkansas received no power from Grand Gulf because of their interstate jurisdictions under US federal law, this debate was significant in that it established firm guidelines for the US electricity industry during a period of deregulation and concern over \"rate shock.\"\nDuring Martin's tenure at the DOE, he was presented with and approved a proposal by Dr. Alvin Trivelpiece to map the Human Genome. The Human Genome Project was the crown jewel of 20th century biology. This chart (available online) was used in the Spring of 1986 by Trivelpiece, then Director of the Office of Energy Research in the Department of Energy, to brief Martin and Under Secretary Joseph Salgado regarding his intention to reprogram $4 million to initiate the project with the approval of Secretary Herrington. This reprogramming was followed by a line item budget of $16 million the following year. This modest effort triggered the activities that led to the sequencing of the Human Genome. It is notable that this scientific gem was launched by the math, physics and supercomputing strengths of the Department of Energy. Trivelpiece and Martin, under the supervision of Secretary Herrington, also collaborated on a project to launch the Superconducting Super Collider. A letter from Martin to Dr. Trivelpiece recounting the origins of ITER, Human Genome and SSC can be seen online.\n\nIn 1987, Acting Secretary of Energy Martin also joined President Reagan and members of his cabinet and the United States Supreme Court to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the ratification of the United States Constitution. President Reagan, accompanied by his Cabinet, spoke on the footsteps of the US Capitol addressing hundreds of thousands of Americans celebrating the event on the National Mall.\n\nMartin has continued to work with the DOE on various projects since his tenure as Deputy Secretary. From 2002 to 2004, he served on the Secretary's Advisory Board (SEAB), chairing the industry-government sub-committee and participated in the drafting of its 2003 report \"Critical Choices: Science, Energy and Security\". Since 2002, he has been Chairman of the Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee (NEAC) and was a committee member of a SEAB group to review the Department of Science. Recently, he served in an advisory capacity on the DOE's Strategic Technology Energy Plan (STEP) aimed to utilize technological gains in energy efficiency to both reduce carbon emissions as well as overall energy consumption. His contribution to the project was to create an energy supply/demand ‘matrix’ approach to detail all sectors of energy use (industrial, commercial, residential etc.) and supplies to meet those demands. A sample matrix can be seen online.\n\nMartin has testified more than twenty-five times before the US House of Representatives and US Senate on topics including: United States energy security; the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement; oil and gas tax policy; the future of natural gas; China's nuclear power prospects; US coal exports; electricity deregulation; the US-Japan Nuclear Cooperation Agreement; the priorities of the Department of Energy, the role of International Energy Agency; renewable energy prospects; the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; the Reagan-Gorbachev fusion agreement; and US economic sanctions policy. A full list and links to the individual testimonies can be found online.\n\nMartin has been part of the campaign of every Republican Presidential candidate since 1988. He has also served as a spokesman/surrogate speaker for the Presidential candidate on matters related to energy and the environment.\n\n1988: First George H.W. Bush Campaign: \nMartin served as policy coordinator for the George H.W. Bush Presidential Campaign producing \"Issues 88\", a compilation of the policies of the campaign under the direction of Charles R. Black, Jr. and James Cicconi. His efforts were commended by George H.W. Bush in a letter that can be seen online.\n\n1992: Second George H.W. Bush Campaign:\nMartin served as the Executive Director of the Republican Platform Committee and co-authored the Committee's volume, \"The Vision Shared: Uniting Our Family, Our Country, Our World\". His responsibilities included managing hearings on topics of the Platform in Kansas City, Salt Lake City and Washington, D.C., culminating in the Platform discussions and presentation at the Republican National Convention in Houston.\n\n1996: Robert Dole Campaign:\nMartin compiled an \"Issues Book\" for the campaign of Robert Dole building on the methodology and presentation of the 1988 Bush Issues Book. He was also commended by Dole for his effort in the following letter.\n\n2000: George W. Bush Campaign\nMartin prepared a national security transition memo at the time of the election of George W. Bush outlining the first year's national security priorities.\n\n2008: John McCain Campaign\nMartin prepared a national security issues paper and calendar for the campaign of John McCain.\n\nWorld Resources Institute:\nMartin joined the board of the World Resources Institute in 1998 and served as WRI's Chairman of the Development Committee. He was instrumental in conceptualizing the October 2000 \"Digital Dividends\" conference between leading environmentalists and technology leaders, including Bill Gates, on reducing the digital divide.\n\nTrilateral Commission:\nIn 1997, he was the lead author of a Trilateral Commission study, \"Maintaining Energy Security in a Global Context\". His co-authors were Helga Stegg and the Japanese Ambassador to the United Nations Disarmament Conference, Ryukichi Imai. The report was translated into French, German and Japanese.\n\nNuclear Energy Advisory Committee:\nMartin is a member of the Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee and served as Chairman from 2002 to 2012. Appointed under the Administration of George W. Bush in 2002, Martin oversaw the sixteen person committee responsible for advising the Department of Energy on four key areas: nuclear reactor research & development (including Gen-IV reactors); technology issues related to fuel cycle; infrastructure requirements for DOE national laboratories; and international nuclear issues (including non-proliferation, safety and security). In 2008, NEAC released the report, \"Nuclear Energy: Policies and Technology for the 21st Century\", to provide a bipartisan approach to nuclear energy and technology road map for advancing safe nuclear energy worldwide. In 2011, Martin and fellow NEAC member Burton Richter (Nobel Prize winner in Physics) teamed up to write \"International Issues in Nuclear Power\", which will be included in the upcoming Hoover Institution book, \"The Nuclear Enterprise.\" Martin has also chaired the NEAC subcommittee on international nuclear energy, and at the December 2013 full NEAC meeting, presented a report that recommended strengthening the US nuclear enterprise.\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations:\nMartin was elected to the Council on Foreign Relations in 1983 and served as chairman of the Council's Energy Security Group from 1997 to 2006. He is a frequent speaker on energy at the Council including recent speeches on the Fukushima disaster and the subsequent effects and energy implications for US-Japan relations as well as presiding over a session with Senator Joseph Lieberman on the future of China's energy situation. On the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr. Martin presented a paper entitled \"Energy: Looking back, Looking Forward 90 Years\".\n\nUniversity for Peace: \nIn 2004, Martin was appointed by the Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan to the Council of the University for Peace. He was then elected President of the Council at its October 2006 meeting. Headquartered in Costa Rica, the United Nations-mandated University for Peace was established in December 1980 as a Treaty Organization by the UN General Assembly. As determined in the Charter of the University, the mission of the University for Peace is \"to provide humanity with an international institution of higher education for peace with the aim of promoting among all human beings the spirit of understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to stimulate cooperation among peoples and to help lessen obstacles and threats to world peace and progress, in keeping with the noble aspirations proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations\". Martin retired after eight years of service on the UPEACE Council and was commended by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in a letter that can be seen online.\n\nNorth Korea:\nMartin served as the chairman of the United Nations Working Group on the DPRK (North Korea), providing assistance to the Six Party Talks (involving representatives of the governments of China, Russia, Japan, United States, North and South Korea) on economic and energy prospects for the DPRK on behalf of the United Nations. This group issued the 2005 report, \"Energy Scenarios for the DPRK\". A companion group on economic issues confronting North Korea was chaired by Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz.\n\nPrague Security Studies Institute:\n\nIn 1998, Martin co-founded the Robinson-Martin Security Scholars Program at the Prague Security Studies Institute that aims to educate Czech students in national security. In 2004 he co-chaired a conference in Prague on \"Energy and Security\" with former Czech Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra focused on developing diversified energy sources for the Czech Republic. He is currently a member of the Board of PSSI and Chairman of the PSSI Corporate Council. For these efforts, he was commended by President Václav Havel for outstanding contributions to the Czech Republic in the following letter.\n\nClub of Prague\nIn 2004, he was co-founder of the Club of Prague, an initiative under the auspices of President Václav Havel to seek more environmentally sensitive energy policies composed of distinguished scientists, historians, philosophers, writers and energy systems engineers. A report on a 2006 conference of the Club of Prague can be seen online.\n\nUS-Japan relations:\nLong interested in , Martin was Chairman of the US-Japan energy working group that produced the 1983 Reagan-Nakasone Joint Statement on Japan-United States Energy Cooperation. He was also active in approving and testifying on the US-Japan Nuclear Cooperation Agreement of 1987 and was the lead witness of the Reagan Administration in support of the agreement before the United States Congress in December, 1987. His testimony can be seen online. More recently, Martin has been coordinator of the Santa Fe Energy Seminar that brings senior Japanese and US government and private sector leaders together to discuss the importance of nuclear energy and its impact on the global environment, world economy and non-proliferation. Martin has also made several speeches on the accident at Fukushima and its implications for Japan, the US and global energy. On July 12, 2014, he appeared before a Japanese government advisory committee of the Ministry of Economics and Trade of Japan (METI) and gave testimony on \"Nuclear Energy from a Global Perspective: The Significance of Japanese Nuclear Capacity for Energy Security and its Deployment in the Global Market.\"\nOrder of the Rising Sun (Japan): Martin received the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver from Emperor Akihito of Japan on May 8, 2018 in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. The citation of the Emperor and Prime Minister notes his contributions to strengthening US-Japan relations in the field of nuclear energy. \n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency:\nIn 2008, he was appointed by IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei as Project Coordinator for the IAEA's 20/20 Project, which provided an assessment of the challenges the Agency will face in a report, \"Reinforcing the Global Nuclear Order for Peace and Prosperity: The Role of the IAEA to 2020 and Beyond\".\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs Leadership Award (France): \nIn 1991, Martin was one of two recipients in the United States honoring American researchers interested in France. The award was granted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France. The research, conducted in French, was focused on the French nuclear energy program.\n\nDepartment of Defense:\nIn early 2003, Martin was assigned to the Office of the Secretary of Defense with responsibilities to recruit senior US civilian advisers for assignments in Iraq. This involved placing American advisers in twenty six Iraqi agencies and ministries for the purposes of reconstruction, as well as dispatching Czech Chief Justice Vojtech Cepl to Iraq to evaluate property restitution. Based on this experience, Justice Cepl with the assistance of Ambassador Boyden Gray initiated the training of over one hundred and forty Iraqi judges in Prague's CEELI Institute.\n\nRonald Reagan Presidential Library:\nWilliam F. Martin’s official White House government files are available in the Ronald Reagan Library archive.\n\nMartin co-founded an international energy consulting firm, Washington Policy & Analysis Inc. with Scott L. Campbell in 1988 at the Washington law firm of Miller & Chevalier. WPA was later bought by the British company Lloyd's of London Press which later became part of Informa, UK.\n\nMartin has two sons and was married to Jill Wheaton Martin from 1974 to 2008. In 2013, William Martin married Paule Audebert of Annecy, France. Nicholas Carl Martin (born August 10, 1982) is a graduate of Swarthmore College and the University for Peace and is President of TechChange, which was recently spotlighted in \"The Economist\" Christopher Flynn Martin (born February 6, 1984) is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania (BA in Psychology) and Kyoto University (Doctorate of Science in Biology). Previously a researcher at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University Dr. Christopher Martin is now a postdoctoral researcher at the Indianapolis Zoo.\n\nMartin is from a pioneering Oklahoma political and oil family. His great-grandfather Dennis T. Flynn was the first US Delegate from Oklahoma Territory to the U.S. House of Representatives, and is the first inductee into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame. His grandfather Olney Flynn was mayor of Tulsa and the Republican nominee for Governor of Oklahoma in 1948. One of Martin's ancestors was John Chisum, the Texas cattleman portrayed by John Wayne in the movie Chisum.\n\n"}

Proponents claim this is necessary to explain polarised light, whereas opponents object to implications for the aether. Doppler doesn't choose sides, although the issue returns in § 6.\n\n§ 2 Doppler observes that colour is a manifestation of the frequency of the light wave, in the eye of the beholder. He describes his principle that a frequency shift occurs when the source or the observer moves. A ship meets waves at a faster rate when sailing against the waves than when sailing along with them. The same goes for sound and light.\n\n§ 3 Doppler derives his equations for the frequency shift, in two cases:\n§ 4 Doppler provides imaginary examples of large and small frequency shifts for sound: \n§ 5 Doppler provides imaginary examples of large and small frequency shifts for light from stars. Velocities are expressed in Meilen/s, and the light speed has a rounded value of 42000 Meilen/s. Doppler assumes that 458 THz (extreme red) and 727 THz (extreme violet) are the borders of the visible spectrum, that the spectrum emitted by stars lies exactly between these borders (except for the infrared stars of § 8), and that the colour of the light emitted by stars is white. \n§ 6 Doppler summarises: \n\nDoppler wishes that his frequency shift theory will soon be tested by another method to determine the radial velocity of stars. He thinks, without reason, that a confirmation of his theory would imply that light is not a transverse but a longitudinal wave.\n\n§ 7 Doppler argues that his theory applies mainly to binary stars. In his opinion the fixed stars are immobile and white. In a binary star high speeds could be possible due to orbital motion, and binaries appear to be colourful. Doppler divides the binaries in two groups: (1) binary stars of unequal brightness; and (2) binary stars of equal brightness. His interpretation is: in case (1) the brighter star is the heavier one, the weaker star revolves around him; in case (2) both stars revolve around a center of mass in the middle, or around a dark third star. In case (2) the colours are usually complementary. Doppler rules out that the rich complementary colours of binaries are contrast illusions, because an astronomer said he had observed that covering one star does not change the colour impression of the other star. Doppler claims that his theory is supported by the fact that for many binary stars the colour indication in Struve's catalogue is different from that in Herschel's older catalogue, attributing the difference to progress of the orbital motion.\n\n§ 8 Doppler presents two groups of variable stars that in his opinion can be explained as binary stars with Doppler effect. These are the \"other stars in the heavens\" from the title. \n\n§ 9 Doppler notes that the orbital speed of the Earth (4.7 Meilen/s) is too low (<33 Meilen/s) to result in visually perceptible colour changes. He identifies two factors that may lead to high orbital speeds in a binary star:\n\nDoppler assumes that there are binary stars with a perihelium speed larger than the speed of light. The astronomer Littrow would have suggested that the perihelium speed of the visual binary star γ Virgo is nearly equal to the speed of light.\n\n§ 10 Doppler summarises the above, and concludes that his speculations explain so much that his theory has to be true. He shares a few more speculations:\n\n§ 11 Conclusion: Doppler expects his frequency shift theory will be accepted, because similar aberrations that depend on v/c (Rømer's and Bradley's) have been accepted before. Doppler waits for the experts to decide if his speculations will do as evidence. He is convinced that finally his principle will be used for the determination of the speed of remote stars.\n\n"}
