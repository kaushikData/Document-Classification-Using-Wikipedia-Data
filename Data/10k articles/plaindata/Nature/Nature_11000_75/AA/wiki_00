The comet is an Earth-Jupiter family comet, meaning that it passes quite close to both Earth and Jupiter. This causes its orbit to be perturbed frequently on an astronomical timescale.\n\nThe nominal orbit of 252P/LINEAR [2001] (K102/1) was thrown into the near-Earth region by Jupiter in February 1785, before which it had a perihelion near that of Mars (1774–1785). Prior to this, it had a perihelion in the asteroid belt (1607–1690) and even further before was most likely a Jupiter Trojan. Since its Jupiter MOID is currently 0.2 AU, Jupiter remains the primary factor in its orbital disruption.\n\nAt some point before 1860, 252P/LINEAR separated from a secondary, smaller fragment discovered in January 2016, designated P/2016 BA14 (PANSTARRS). The nucleus of the secondary is 60–200 meters wide, half that of the primary. 252P/LINEAR will get as close as 0.0356 AU (13.9 LD) to Earth on 21 March 2016 and P/2016 BA14 (PANSTARRS) will get as close as 0.0237 AU (9.2 LD) to Earth on 22 March 2016.\n\n252P/LINEAR is predicted to perhaps make a weak new meteor shower during its 2016 approach. Peter Jenniskens and Jeremie\nVaubaillon calculated that possible meteors from this comet would radiate from the constellation of Lepus, south of Orion, from a radiant at R.A. = 77.0 deg, Decl. = -16.3 deg., with a slow geocentric velocity of Vg = 11.1 km/s on March 28 and 29, when Earth reaches the comet orbit. Rates will be low. There are no encounters with the dust trails created since A.D. 1850, but instead a diffuse cloud of perturbed meteoroids ejected during 1894-1926 is calculated to be in Earth's path (see CBET telegram 4267).\n\nQuan-Zhi Ye calculated that possible meteors from comet P/2016 BA14 (PANSTARRS) would radiate from the constellation Columba, south of Lepus during the late UT hours of March 20. The radiant is at R.A. = 82 deg, Decl. = -39 deg, with geocentric velocity Vg = 14.1 km/s. Meteoroids ejected since A.D. 1750 were studied, with also no dust trail encounters found in 2016 (see CBET telegram 4259).\n\nA meteor shower has been observed with a similar orbit to 252P/LINEAR, previously known as the March Lyncids, in the constellation Lynx. It is not known for certain if the shower is related to the comet.\n\nP/2016 BA14 was radar imaged at distance of 2.2 million miles (9 lunar distances) during a flyby of Earth in 2016. This enabled the size of the nucleus to be calculated to be about 3000 to 3300 feet (1 km) in diameter, which was bigger than expected.\n\nBA 14 had unique history in that when it was discovered in January 2016 by a PanSTARRS telescope, it was thought to be an asteroid and went by a provisional minor planet designation 2016 BA14.. An astronomer then realized the body's orbit was very similar to 252P/LINEAR , which lead to a follow up observation by the Discovery Channel Telescope. The body showed a tail, identifying it as a probable comet and then named P/2016 BA14.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55254540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55254540", "title": "25zero", "text": "25zero\n\n25zero is a mountaineering project, tracking equatorial glacial melt and raising awareness of the impacts of climate change, led by explorer Tim Jarvis AM. The project was founded in 2014, and focussed on bringing live footage from the peaks of three mountain glaciers to the 37,000 delegates at the COP21 summit in Paris, France, as a way of showcasing the impact of global warming on vulnerable and remote areas.\n\nIn 2016, following the 2015 summit, the 25zero project grew into a documentary film production, with a broader focus on both the glaciers themselves and the communities that live near them.\n\nWhile many mountains straddle the equator, only 25 of these have a glacier at their peak (defined at the time of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adoption in 1992); hence, 25 mountains at zero latitude. In reality, however, there are about three degrees (some 320 km) of leniency in the inclusions, both North and South. Additionally, the name wordplays on estimates that within an average of 25 years, all these glaciers will have retreated to zero ice.\n\nAccording to the project team, this is important because melting ice is an excellent proxy indicator for climate change impacts. While much of the public global interest centres around ice-melt at the Earth's poles, relatively little attention is given to the ice at more unexpected locations, such as in the high-altitude tropics.\n\nSince 1992, four of the 25 mountains originally included have 'lost' their glacier completely.\n\nThe notional baseline date for mountains included in the 25zero project are those mountains that had glaciers in 1992, when the UN started to \"began to climate change (and acting on it) seriously\". After several years of UNFCCC processes, the Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997. Around that time, 25 mountains at the equator had glaciers. The project uses climbing expeditions to the various mountain ranges to support published glaciology data, effectively tracking the status of the equatorial glaciers against the backdrop of the UN timeline on climate change action.\n\nThe 25zero climbing team has varied over time depending on the expedition, although the original 2014 team comprised:\n\n\nThe up-to-date team are listed on the project website, 25zero.\n\nWhile the 25zero mountains are spread around the world, more than half of them are located in the South American Andes mountain range, and chiefly in Ecuador.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the project lists a number of 'recently deceased' glaciers, which it defines as no longer being able to detect permanent glacial ice. These three are all in Ecuador:\n\nAccording to some glaciologists, contradictory information exists in the literature as to whether glaciers on Sangay and Cerro Ayapungo (locally known as Soroche) are true glaciers or only permanent snow (névé or firn).\n\nIn December 2015, to coincide with the COP21 climate change talks in Paris, multiple 25zero teams scaled a number of the 25zero peaks. Jarvis and a core team summited Carstensz Pyramid (4,884 m) in Indonesia, and Mount Stanley (5,109 m) and Mount Baker (4,844 m) in Uganda. Simultaneously, other 25zero teams climbed Mount Kenya (5,199 m), Kilimanjaro (5,895 m) and a number of Ecuadorian peaks. Footage, observations and stories from these climbs were transmitted to a government-endorsed press conference for 25zero at COP21 in Paris.\n\nIn 2016, Jarvis and colleague Royal Marines Sergeant Major Barry Gray went on an information-gathering and mountain-climbing expedition to Ecuador for the 25zero project. They successfully summited three glaciated mountains in Ecuador: Illiniza Sur (5,248 m), Antisana (5,704 m) and Chimborazo (6,310 m). The trip coincided with the ongoing UN climate change talks in Marrakech (COP22).\n\nIn September 2017, Jarvis together with Ecuadorian climbers Edgar Parra and Ethan Sigle summited Carihuazo (5,018 m), and climbed and documented glacier decline on Cayambe (5,790 m) and Cotopaxi (5,897 m).\n\nIn June 2018, Jarvis assembled a large climbing team, including a film crew and several social media and mountaineering identities, to undertake climbs in East Africa, including Kilimanjaro, Mount Speke, and Mount Stanley.\n\n25zero (and the project team) has received a number of awards for contribution to conservation and public education.\n\nThe project has received citation through the annual awards of the Australian Geographic Society, with project leader Tim Jarvis receiving the title of Conservationist of the Year in 2016, for his work on 25zero. The Society had also supported the expedition.\n\nJarvis was jointly awarded the Jim Bettison and Helen James Award in 2016 in recognition of the 25zero project. The award is patronised by the Jim Bettison and Helen James Foundation, and recognises \"lifelong high achievement in an area of expertise and enable further work of benefit to the community\" and administered by the Adelaide Film Festival and the Adelaide Festival of Ideas.\n"}

The name is from the Greek word for clear – \"αίθριος\".\n\nIt consists of a metallic cup standing upon a tall hollow pedestal, with a differential thermometer placed so that one of its bulbs is in the focus of the paraboloid formed by the cavity of the cup. The interior of the cup is highly polished and is kept covered by a plate of metal, being opened when an observation is made. The second bulb is always screened from the sky and so is not affected by the radiative effect of the clear sky, the action of which is concentrated upon the first bulb. The contraction of the air in the second bulb by its sudden exposure to a clear sky causes the liquid in the stem to rise.\n\nThe device will respond in a contrary fashion when exposed to heat radiation and so may be used as a pyrometer too.\n"}
{"id": "59211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59211", "title": "Altitude", "text": "Altitude\n\nAltitude or height (sometimes known as 'depth') is defined based on the context in which it is used (aviation, geometry, geographical survey, sport, atmospheric pressure, and many more). As a general definition, altitude is a distance measurement, usually in the vertical or \"up\" direction, between a reference datum and a point or object. The reference datum also often varies according to the context. Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location, in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage.\n\nVertical distance measurements in the \"down\" direction are commonly referred to as depth.\n\nIn aviation, the term altitude can have several meanings, and is always qualified by explicitly adding a modifier (e.g. \"true altitude\"), or implicitly through the context of the communication. Parties exchanging altitude information must be clear which definition is being used.\n\nAviation altitude is measured using either mean sea level (MSL) or local ground level (above ground level, or AGL) as the reference datum.\n\nPressure altitude divided by 100 feet (30 m) is the flight level, and is used above the transition altitude ( in the US, but may be as low as in other jurisdictions); so when the altimeter reads 18,000 ft on the standard pressure setting the aircraft is said to be at \"Flight level 180\". When flying at a flight level, the altimeter is always set to standard pressure (29.92 inHg or 1013.25 hPa).\n\nOn the flight deck, the definitive instrument for measuring altitude is the pressure altimeter, which is an aneroid barometer with a front face indicating distance (feet or metres) instead of atmospheric pressure.\n\nThere are several types of aviation altitude:\n\n\nThese types of altitude can be explained more simply as various ways of measuring the altitude:\n\nThe Earth's atmosphere is divided into several altitude regions. These regions start and finish at varying heights depending on season and distance from the poles. The altitudes stated below are averages:\n\nThe Kármán line, at an altitude of above sea level, by convention defines represents the demarcation between the atmosphere and space. The thermosphere and exosphere (along with the higher parts of the mesosphere) are regions of the atmosphere that are conventionally defined as space.\n\nRegions on the Earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at above sea level.\n\nAt high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.\n\nThe temperature profile of the atmosphere is a result of an interaction between radiation and convection. Sunlight in the visible spectrum hits the ground and heats it. The ground then heats the air at the surface. If radiation were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space, the greenhouse effect of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly , and the temperature would decay exponentially with height.\n\nHowever, when air is hot, it tends to expand, which lowers its density. Thus, hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward. This is the process of convection. Convection comes to equilibrium when a parcel of air at a given altitude has the same density as its surroundings. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so a parcel of air will rise and fall without exchanging heat. This is known as an adiabatic process, which has a characteristic pressure-temperature curve. As the pressure gets lower, the temperature decreases. The rate of decrease of temperature with elevation is known as the adiabatic lapse rate, which is approximately 9.8 °C per kilometer (or 5.4 °F per 1000 feet) of altitude.\n\nNote that the presence of water in the atmosphere complicates the process of convection. Water vapor contains latent heat of vaporization. As air rises and cools, it eventually becomes saturated and cannot hold its quantity of water vapor. The water vapor condenses (forming clouds), and releases heat, which changes the lapse rate from the dry adiabatic lapse rate to the moist adiabatic lapse rate (5.5 °C per kilometer or 3 °F per 1000 feet.\nAs an average, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines an international standard atmosphere (ISA) with a temperature lapse rate of 6.49 °C per kilometer (3.56 °F per 1,000 feet). The actual lapse rate can vary by altitude and by location.\n\nFinally, note that only the troposphere (up to approximately of altitude) in the Earth's atmosphere undergoes notable convection; in the stratosphere, there is little vertical convection.\n\nMedicine recognizes that altitudes above start to affect humans, and there is no record of humans living at extreme altitudes above for more than two years. As the altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases, which affects humans by reducing the partial pressure of oxygen. The lack of oxygen above can cause serious illnesses such as altitude sickness, high altitude pulmonary edema, and high altitude cerebral edema. The higher the altitude, the more likely are serious effects. The human body can adapt to high altitude by breathing faster, having a higher heart rate, and adjusting its blood chemistry. It can take days or weeks to adapt to high altitude. However, above , (in the \"death zone\"), altitude acclimatization becomes impossible.\n\nThere is a significantly lower overall mortality rate for permanent residents at higher altitudes. Additionally, there is a dose response relationship between increasing elevation and decreasing obesity prevalence in the United States. In addition, the recent hypothesis suggests that high altitude could be protective against Alzheimer's disease via action of erythropoietin, a hormone released by kidney in response to hypoxia.\nHowever, people living at higher elevations have a statistically significant higher rate of suicide. The cause for the increased suicide risk is unknown so far.\n\nFor athletes, high altitude produces two contradictory effects on performance. For explosive events (sprints up to 400 metres, long jump, triple jump) the reduction in atmospheric pressure signifies less atmospheric resistance, which generally results in improved athletic performance. For endurance events (races of 5,000 metres or more) the predominant effect is the reduction in oxygen which generally reduces the athlete's performance at high altitude. Sports organizations acknowledge the effects of altitude on performance: the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF), for example, marks record performances achieved at an altitude greater than with the letter \"A\".\n\nAthletes also can take advantage of altitude acclimatization to increase their performance. The same changes that help the body cope with high altitude increase performance back at sea level. These changes are the basis of altitude training which forms an integral part of the training of athletes in a number of endurance sports including track and field, distance running, triathlon, cycling and swimming.\n\nDecreased oxygen availability and decreased temperature make life at high altitude challenging. Despite these environmental conditions, many species have been successfully adapted at high altitudes. Animals have developed physiological adaptations to enhance oxygen uptake and delivery to tissues which can be used to sustain metabolism. The strategies used by animals to adapt to high altitude depend on their morphology and phylogeny. For example, small mammals face the challenge of maintaining body heat in cold temperatures, due to their small volume to surface area ratio. As oxygen is used as a source of metabolic heat production, the hypobaric hypoxia at high altitudes is problematic.\n\nThere is also a general trend of smaller body sizes and lower species richness at high altitudes, likely due to lower oxygen partial pressures. These factors may decrease productivity in high altitude habitats, meaning there will be less energy available for consumption, growth, and activity.\n\nHowever, some species, such as birds,thrive at high altitude. Birds thrive because of physiological features that are advantageous for high-altitude flight.\n\n\n"}

The law on the subject is complex, because various states apply differing principles of nationality, namely \"jus soli\" and \"jus sanguinis\", to varying degrees and with varying qualifications.\n\nBefore the 1961 convention, quite a number of states expressly provided, in their laws, that births and deaths aboard an aircraft registered to that state are considered to have occurred on national territory, and thus the nationality laws of that territory apply. One such was § 32(5) of the British Nationality Act 1948.\nUnder the 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation, articles 17–21, all aircraft have the nationality of the state in which they are registered, and may not have multiple nationalities. The law of the aircraft's nationality is applicable on the aircraft. However, nationality laws of any country already apply everywhere, since it is for each country to determine who are its nationals. So this convention has no effect on nationality laws. The convention does not say that a birth on a country's aircraft is to be treated as a birth in that country for the purposes of nationality.\n\nUnder the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, for the purposes of determining the obligations under the convention, a birth on a ship or aircraft in international waters or airspace shall be treated as a birth in the country of the ship or aircraft's registration. However, the convention applies only to births where the child would otherwise be stateless. Since in most cases a child would be covered by one or more countries' jus sanguinis at birth (getting the same citizenship as its parents), this convention rarely comes into play. In addition, there are still very few member states that are party to the 1961 convention.\n\nChildren born in Canadian airspace are automatically extended Canadian citizenship, but birth in or over international waters is assessed on a case-by-case basis. Various factors are assessed in determining citizenship at birth, parentage being the most important factor. But being born in a Canadian-registered vehicle would establish a connection with Canada which would probably be taken into account, if application was made to have the person declared a Canadian citizen.\n\nU.S. law holds that natural persons born on foreign ships docked at U.S. ports or born within the limit of U.S. territorial waters are U.S. citizens. An important exception to this rule is that children born to people who (in line with the 14th Amendment) are not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States (e.g., foreign diplomats accredited with the United States Department of State or invading foreign enemy forces) are not automatically U.S. citizens. Despite a common misconception to the contrary, birth on board a U.S.-flagged ship, airliner, or military vessel outside of the 12-nautical mile (22.2 km/ 13-13/16 st. mi.) limit is not considered to be a birth on U.S. territory, and the principle of \"jus soli\" thus does not apply.\n\nIn addition to the question of a child's citizenship, there is also a question of how to report \"Place of Birth\" for children born in transit. US State Department guidance instructs that a child born in international waters should have their place of birth listed as \"AT SEA\", while those born in the territorial waters of any country would list the name of that country. A child born in flight in a region where no country claims sovereignty would list their place of birth as \"IN THE AIR\".\n\n\n"}

The wavelengths are usually high-energy radiation such as X-rays and gamma rays. By blocking radiation in a known pattern, a coded \"shadow\" is cast upon a plane. The properties of the original radiation sources can then be mathematically reconstructed from this shadow. Coded apertures are used in X- and gamma ray imaging systems, because these high-energy rays cannot be focused with lenses or mirrors that work for visible light.\n\nImaging is usually made at optical wavelengths by lenses and mirrors. However, for X-rays and γ-rays, lenses and mirrors do not exist, or else are impractical. Image modulation by apertures is therefore often used instead. The pinhole camera is the most basic form of such a modulation imager, but its disadvantage is low throughput, as its small aperture allows through little radiation. Only a tiny fraction of the light passes through the pinhole, which causes a low signal-to-noise ratio. To solve this problem, the mask can contain many holes, in one of several particular patterns, for example. Multiple masks, at varying distances from a detector, add flexibility to this tool. Specifically the modulation collimator, invented by Minoru Oda, was used to identify the first cosmic X-ray source and thereby to launch the new field of X-ray astronomy in 1965. Many other applications in other fields, such as tomography, have since appeared.\n\nIn a coded aperture more complicated than a pinhole camera, images from multiple apertures will overlap at the detector array. It is thus necessary to use a computational algorithm (which depends on the precise configuration of the aperture arrays) to reconstruct the original image. In this way a sharp image can be achieved without a lens. The image is formed from the whole array of sensors and is therefore tolerant to faults in individual sensors; on the other hand it accepts more background radiation than a focusing-optics imager (e.g., a refracting or reflecting telescope), and therefore is normally not favored at wavelengths where these techniques can be applied.\n\nThe coded aperture imaging technique is one of the earliest forms of computational photography and has a strong affinity to astronomical interferometry. Aperture-coding was first introduced by Ables and Dicke and later popularized by other publications.\n\nDifferent mask patterns exhibit different image resolutions, sensitivities and background-noise rejection, and computational simplicities and ambiguities, aside from their relative ease of construction.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1260546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1260546", "title": "Creation Research Society", "text": "Creation Research Society\n\nThe Creation Research Society (CRS) is a Christian research group that engages in creation science. The organization has produced various publications, including a journal and a creation-based biology textbook. During the first few years of its existence, different beliefs about Creationism and disagreement over its statement of beliefs resulted in various members of the board and voting members being forced out of the organization.\n\nWalter E. Lammerts formed the organization in the 1950s after becoming concerned that the American Scientific Affiliation was falling under the influence of theistic evolution. It was originally named the Creation Research Advisory Committee in February 1963, and headed by Walter E. Lammerts and Wiliam J. Tinkle with assistance from Henry M. Morris. The committee originally consisted of ten creationists: Lammerts, Tinkle, Morris, John W. Klotz, Frank Lewis Marsh, Edwin Y. Monsma, Duane Gish, Wilbert H. Rusch, John J. Grebe, and R. Laird Harris. The CRS was later formed in June 1963, with the original advisory committee constituting the new society's 'steering committee', with Karl W. Linsenmann, David A. Warriner and John N. Moore joining it at that time. At about the same time, Morris recruited Harold S. Slusher, Thomas G. Barnes, Willis L. Webb and later Clifford L. Burdlick. Finally, Paul A. Zimmerman joined it. By the end of the year had expanded to approximately fifty members. Members with at least an M.Sc. or equivalent were eligible to be voting members.\n\nThe organization's early growth allowed Lammerts to purge committee members who were insufficiently active or orthodox. Four committee members were removed: Monsma and Webb for inactivity, Harris for opposing a literal six-day creation, and Warriner after losing his university position and suggesting that the society hire him as a paid promoter. These members were replaced by George F. Howe, Bolton Davidheiser and H. Douglas Dean. Dean and Davidheiser left after only two years, Dean because of his unorthodox views on Evolution, and Davidheiser because he was unable to work with Seventh Day Adventists on the committee. Marsh, an Adventist, left about the same time because he interpreted the society's weekend meetings as a religious affront.\n\nBy the end of 1964, the society had grown sufficiently that Lammerts decided to purge the society of Old Earth, Gap and Day Age creationists:\nIn 1967, Lammerts arranged for Morris to succeed him as chairman of the board, in order to ensure continuing fidelity to flood geology. Historian of creationism Ronald L. Numbers states that the Society \"acquired a well-deserved reputation for welcoming only committed flood geologists.\"\n\nIn response to the Sputnik-inspired emphasis on science education, and the resultant Biological Sciences Curriculum Study textbooks (which emphasised evolution for the first time), creationists in the early 1960s were searching for an orthodox and up-to-date creationist biology textbook. The CRS responded with \"Biology: A Search for Order in Complexity\", published in 1970 by Christian publisher Zondervan, which was a mixed success, selling out its first run of 10,000, and being approved by a number of state textbook committees, but being adopted by few public schools and after an Indiana school that attempted to make exclusive use of it, a state court banned its use (in \"Hendren v. Campbell\") stating:\n\nThe statement of belief was an issue of discussion among the 10 founders during its formation, with typical wrangling over wording, and little consensus beyond keeping out anyone supportive of evolution. There was concern that Flood Geology would be able to explain all geologic evidence and whether the six literal-day creation included the creation of the universe.\n\nThe CRS adopted the following statement of belief, mandatory for all members:\n\nThe society's stated purpose is \"publication and research which impinge on creation as an alternate view of origins\".\n\nThe CRS' statement of belief was cited in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling of Edwards v. Aguillard. Its mandate that members affirm that the origin story described in Genesis was an established fact was cited by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. as evidence there was a fundamentalist sectarian objective in the field of creation science and in Louisiana's 1981 Balanced Treatment Act, a law requiring creation science instruction in the state's public schools wherever scientific evolution was taught. The judge ruled, \"the intent of the Louisiana Legislature was to promote a particular religious belief\" and therefore the teaching of creationism was unconstitutional.\n\nThe \"Creation Research Society Quarterly\" has been published since July, 1964. \"Creation Matters\" containing popular level articles has been published bi-monthly since 1996. CRS has also published an assortment of special papers, monographs and books. Creationist publications have been criticized by scientists, such as Massimo Pigliucci, as \"nonsense\" in their attempt to blend faith with empirical fact. Glenn R. Morton is an author of more than 20 articles published by CRS in an attempt to \"solve scientific problems\" of creationism. Morton later left the creationist movement complaining \"The reaction to the pictures, seismic data, the logic disgusted me. They were more interested in what I sounded like than in the data!\".\n\nThe Creation Research Society maintains a working electron microscope laboratory (scanning EM and transmission EM) at the Van Andel Creation Research Center in Chino Valley, AZ. Recently Mark Armitage and Kevin Anderson of the CRS published their findings of soft tissues in \"Triceratops\" horn collected at the Hell Creek Formation in Glendive, MT.\n\n\n"}

It has an aphanitic to porphyritic texture and is intermediate in composition between andesite and rhyolite. The word dacite comes from Dacia, a province of the Roman Empire which lay between the Danube River and Carpathian Mountains (now modern Romania and Moldova) where the rock was first described.\n\nDacite consists mostly of plagioclase feldspar with biotite, hornblende, and pyroxene (augite and/or enstatite). It has quartz as some rounded, corroded phenocrysts, or as an element of the ground-mass.\nThe relative proportions of feldspars and quartz in dacite, and in many other volcanic rocks, are illustrated in the QAPF diagram. The TAS classification, based on silica and alkali contents, puts dacite in the O3 sector .\nThe plagioclase ranges from oligoclase to andesine and labradorite. Sanidine occurs, although in small proportions, in some dacites, and when abundant gives rise to rocks that form transitions to the rhyolites.\n\nThe groundmass of these rocks is composed of plagioclase and quartz.\n\nIn hand specimen, many of the hornblende and biotite dacites are grey or pale brown and yellow rocks with white feldspars, and black crystals of biotite and hornblende. Other dacites, especially pyroxene-bearing dacites, are darker colored.\n\nIn thin section, dacites may have an aphanitic to porphyritic texture. Porphyritic dacites contain blocky highly zoned plagioclase phenocrysts and/or rounded corroded quartz phenocrysts. Subhedral hornblende and elongated biotite grains are present. Sanidine phenocrysts and augite (or enstatite) are found in some samples. The groundmass of these rocks is often aphanitic microcrystalline, with a web of minute feldspars mixed with interstitial grains of quartz or tridymite; but in many dacites it is largely vitreous, while in others it is felsitic or cryptocrystalline.\n\nDacite usually forms as an intrusive rock such as a dike or sill. Examples of this type of dacite outcrop are found in northwestern Montana and northeastern Bulgaria. Nevertheless, because of the moderately high silica content, dacitic magma is quite viscous and therefore prone to explosive eruption. A notorious example of this is Mount St. Helens in which dacite domes formed from previous eruptions. Pyroclastic flows may also be of dacitic composition as is the case with the Fish Canyon Tuff of La Garita Caldera.\n\nDacitic magma is formed by the subduction of young oceanic crust under a thick felsic continental plate. Oceanic crust is hydrothermally altered causing addition of quartz and sodium. As the young, hot oceanic plate is subducted under continental crust, the subducted slab partially melts and interacts with the upper mantle through convection and dehydration reactions. The process of subduction creates metamorphism in the subducting slab. When this slab reaches the mantle and initiates the dehydration reactions, minerals such as talc, serpentine, mica and amphiboles break down generating a more sodic melt. The magma then continues to migrate upwards causing differentiation and becomes even more sodic and silicic as it rises. Once at the cold surface, the sodium rich magma crystallizes plagioclase, quartz and hornblende. Accessory minerals like pyroxenes provide insight to the history of the magma.\n\nThe formation of dacite provides a great deal of information about the connection between oceanic crust and continental crust. It provides a model for the generation of felsic, buoyant, perennial rock from a mafic, dense, short-lived one.\n\nThe process by which dacite forms has been used to explain the generation of continental crust during the Archean eon. At that time, the fabrication of dacitic magma was more ubiquitous due to the availability of young hot oceanic crust. Today, the colder oceanic crust that subducts under most plates is not capable of melting before the dehydration reactions therefore inhibiting the process.\n\nDacite magma was encountered in a drillhole during geothermal exploration on Kīlauea in 2005. At a depth of 2488 m, the magma flowed up the wellbore. This produced several kilograms of clear, colorless vitric (glassy, non-crystalline) cuttings at the surface. The dacite magma is a residual melt of the typical basalt magma of Kīlauea.\n\nDacite is relatively common and occurs in various tectonic and magmatic contexts:\n\nSites of dacite in Europe are Germany (Weiselberg in the Saarland), Greece (Nisyros and Thera), Italy (in Bozen quartz porphyry, and Sardinia), Austria (Styrian Volcano Arc), Romania (Transylvania), Scotland (Argyll), Slovakia, Spain (El Hoyazo near Almería), France (Massif de l'Esterel) and Hungary (Csódi Hill).\n\nSites outside Europe include Iran, Morocco, New Zealand (volcanic region of Taupo), Turkey, USA and Zambia.\n\nDacite is found extraterrestrially at Nili Patera caldera of Syrtis Major Planum on Mars.\n\n"}
{"id": "19444970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19444970", "title": "Dark flow", "text": "Dark flow\n\nIn astrophysics, dark flow is a possible non-random component of the peculiar velocity of galaxy clusters. The actual measured velocity is the sum of the velocity predicted by Hubble's Law plus a possible small and unexplained (or \"dark\") velocity flowing in a common direction.\n\nAccording to standard cosmological models, the motion of galaxy clusters with respect to the cosmic microwave background should be randomly distributed in all directions. However, analyzing the three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data using the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, astronomers Alexander Kashlinsky, F. Atrio-Barandela, D. Kocevski and H. Ebeling found evidence of a \"surprisingly coherent\" 600–1000 km/s flow of clusters toward a 20-degree patch of sky between the constellations of Centaurus and Vela.\n\nThe researchers had suggested that the motion may be a remnant of the influence of no-longer-visible regions of the universe prior to inflation. Telescopes cannot see events earlier than about 380,000 years after the Big Bang, when the universe became transparent (the cosmic microwave background); this corresponds to the particle horizon at a distance of about 46 billion (4.6×10) light years. Since the matter causing the net motion in this proposal is outside this range, it would in a certain sense be outside our visible universe; however, it would still be in our past light cone.\n\nThe results appeared in the October 20, 2008, issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters.<ref name=\"10.1086/592947\"></ref><ref name=\"10.1088/0004-637X/691/2/1479\"></ref>\n\nIn 2013, data from the Planck space telescope showed no evidence of \"dark flow\" on that sort of scale, discounting the claims of evidence for either gravitational effects reaching beyond the visible universe or existence of a multiverse. However, in 2015 Kashlinsky \"et al\" claim to have found support for its existence using both Planck and WMAP data.<ref name=\"10.1088/0004-637X/810/2/143\"></ref>\n\nThe dark flow was determined to be flowing in the direction of the Centaurus and Hydra constellations. This corresponds with the direction of the Great Attractor, which is a gravitational mystery originally discovered in 1973. However, the source of the Great Attractor's attraction was thought to originate from a massive cluster of galaxies called the Norma Cluster, located about 250 million light-years away from Earth.\n\nIn a study from March 2010, Kashlinsky extended his work from 2008, by using the 5-year WMAP results rather than the 3-year results, and doubling the number of galaxy clusters observed from 700. The team also sorted the cluster catalog into four \"slices\" representing different distance ranges. They then examined the preferred flow direction for the clusters within each slice. While the size and exact position of this direction display some variation, the overall trends among the slices exhibit remarkable agreement. \"We detect motion along this axis, but right now our data cannot state as strongly as we'd like whether the clusters are coming or going,\" Kashlinsky said.\n\nThe team has so far catalogued the effect as far out as 2.5 billion light-years, and hopes to expand its catalog out further still to twice the current distance.\n\nAstrophysicist Ned Wright posted an online response to the study arguing that its methods are flawed. The authors of the \"dark flow\" study released a statement in return, refuting three of Wright's five arguments and identifying the remaining two as a typo and a technicality that do not affect the measurements and their interpretation.\n\nA more recent statistical work done by Ryan Keisler claims to rule out the possibility that the dark flow is a physical phenomenon because Kashlinsky et al. did not consider the primary anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) to be as important as they are.\n\nNASA's Goddard Space Center considered that this could be the effect of a sibling universe or a region of space-time fundamentally different from the observable universe. Data on more than 1,000 galaxy clusters have been measured, including some as distant as 3 billion light-years. Alexander Kashlinsky claims these measurements show the universe's steady flow is clearly not a statistical fluke. Kashlinsky said: \"At this point we don't have enough information to see what it is, or to constrain it. We can only say with certainty that somewhere very far away the world is very different than what we see locally. Whether it's 'another universe' or a different fabric of space-time we don't know.\" Laura Mersini-Houghton and Rich Holman observe that some anisotropy is predicted both by theories involving interaction with another universe, or when the frame of reference of the CMB does not coincide with that of the universe's expansion.\n\nIn 2013, data from the European Space Agency's Planck satellite was claimed to show no statistically significant evidence of existence of dark flow. However, another analysis by a member of the Planck collaboration, Fernando Atrio-Barandela, suggested the data were consistent with the earlier findings from WMAP. Popular media continued to be interested in the idea, with Mersini-Houghton claiming the Planck results support existence of a multiverse.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9300", "title": "Ediacaran", "text": "Ediacaran\n\nThe Ediacaran Period (), spans 94 million years from the end of the Cryogenian Period 635 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Cambrian Period 541 Mya. It marks the end of the Proterozoic Eon, and the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon. It is named after the Ediacara Hills of South Australia.\n\nThe Ediacaran Period's status as an official geological period was ratified in 2004 by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), making it the first new geological period declared in 120 years.\nAlthough the period takes its name from the Ediacara Hills where geologist Reg Sprigg first discovered fossils of the eponymous Ediacara biota in 1946, the type section is located in the bed of the Enorama Creek within Brachina Gorge in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia, at .\n\nThe Ediacaran Period overlaps, but is shorter than the Vendian Period, a name that was earlier, in 1952, proposed by Russian geologist and paleontologist Boris Sokolov. The Vendian concept was formed stratigraphically top-down, and the lower boundary of the Cambrian became the upper boundary of the Vendian.\n\nPaleontological substantiation of this boundary was worked out separately for the siliciclastic basin (base of the Baltic Stage of the Eastern European Platform) and for the carbonate basin (base of the Tommotian Stage of the Siberian Platform).\nThe lower boundary of the Vendian was suggested to be defined at the base of the Varanger (Laplandian) tillites.\n\nThe Vendian in its type area consists of large subdivisions such as Laplandian, Redkino, Kotlin and Rovno Regional stages with the globally traceable subdivisions and their boundaries, including its lower one.\n\nThe Redkino, Kotlin and Rovno regional stages have been substantiated in the type area of the Vendian on the basis of the abundant organic-walled microfossils, megascopic algae, metazoan body fossils and ichnofossils.\n\nThe lower boundary of the Vendian could have a biostratigraphic substantiation as well taking into consideration the worldwide occurrence of the Pertatataka assemblage of giant acanthomorph acritarchs.\n\nThe Ediacaran Period (c. 635–542 Mya) represents the time from the end of global Marinoan glaciation to the first appearance worldwide of somewhat complicated trace fossils (\"Treptichnus pedum\" (Seilacher, 1955)).\n\nAlthough the Ediacaran Period does contain soft-bodied fossils, it is unusual in comparison to later periods because its beginning is not defined by a change in the fossil record. Rather, the beginning is defined at the base of a chemically distinctive carbonate layer that is referred to as a \"cap carbonate,\" because it caps glacial deposits.\n\nThis bed is characterized by an unusual depletion of C that indicates a sudden climatic change at the end of the Marinoan ice age. The lower boundary GSSP of the Ediacaran is at the base of the cap carbonate (Nuccaleena Formation), immediately above the Elatina diamictite in the Enorama Creek section, Brachina Gorge, Flinders Ranges, South Australia.\n\nThe GSSP of the upper boundary of the Ediacaran is the lower boundary of the Cambrian on the SE coast of Newfoundland approved by the International Commission on Stratigraphy as a preferred alternative to the base of the Tommotian Stage in Siberia which was selected on the basis of the ichnofossil \"Treptichnus pedum\" (Seilacher, 1955). In the history of stratigraphy it was the first case of usage of bioturbations for the System boundary definition.\n\nNevertheless, the definitions of the lower and upper boundaries of the Ediacaran on the basis of chemostratigraphy and ichnofossils are disputable.\n\nCap carbonates generally have a restricted geographic distribution (due to specific conditions of their precipitation) and usually siliciclastic sediments laterally replace the cap carbonates in a rather short distance but cap carbonates do not occur above every tillite elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe C-isotope chemostratigraphic characteristics obtained for contemporaneous cap carbonates in different parts of the world may be variable in a wide range owing to different degrees of secondary alteration of carbonates, dissimilar criteria used for selection of the least altered samples, and, as far as the C-isotope data are concerned, due to primary lateral variations of δ C in the upper layer of the ocean.\n\nFurthermore, Oman presents in its stratigraphic record a large negative carbon isotope excursion, within the Shuram Formation that is clearly away from any glacial evidence strongly questioning systematic association of negative δ C excursion and glacial events. Also, the Shuram excursion is prolonged and is estimated to last for ~9.0 Myrs.\n\nAs to the \"Treptichnus pedum\", a reference ichnofossil for the lower boundary of the Cambrian, its usage for the stratigraphic detection of this boundary is always risky, because of the occurrence of very similar trace fossils belonging to the Treptichnids group well below the level of \"T. pedum\" in Namibia, Spain and Newfoundland, and possibly, in the western United States. The stratigraphic range of \"T. pedum\" overlaps the range of the Ediacaran fossils in Namibia, and probably in Spain.\n\nThe Ediacaran period is not yet formally subdivided, but a proposed scheme recognises an Upper Ediacaran whose base corresponds with the Gaskiers glaciation, a Terminal Ediacaran Stage starting around , a preceding stage beginning around 557 Ma with the earliest widespread Ediacaran biota fossils; two proposed schemes differ on whether the lower strata should be divided into an Early and Middle Ediacaran or not, because it's not clear whether the Shuram excursion (which would divide the Early and Middle) is a separate event from the Gaskiers, or whether the two events are correlated.\n\nThe dating of the rock type section of the Ediacaran Period in South Australia has proven uncertain. Therefore, the age range of 635 to 542 million years is based on correlations to other countries where dating has been possible. The base age of approximately 635 million years is based on U–Pb (uranium–lead) isochron dating from Namibia and China.\n\nApplying this age to the base of the Ediacaran assumes that cap carbonates are laid down synchronously around the world and that the correct cap carbonate layers have been selected in such diverse locales as Australian and Namibia. This is controversial because an age of about 580 million years has been obtained for glacial rocks in Tasmania which some scientists tentatively assign to those just beneath the Ediacaran rocks of the Flinders Ranges. The age of the top is the same as the widely recognised age for the base of the Cambrian Period 542± 0.3 Mya, producing a misalignment, as the end of the Edicarian Period should mark the start of the Cambrian Period.\n\nThe fossil record from the Ediacaran Period is sparse, as more easily fossilized hard-shelled animals had yet to evolve. The Ediacaran biota include the oldest definite multicellular organisms (with specialized tissues), the most common types of which resemble segmented worms, fronds, disks, or immobile bags.\n\nEdiacara biota bear little resemblance to modern lifeforms, and their relationship even with the immediately following lifeforms of the Cambrian explosion is rather difficult to interpret. More than 100 genera have been described, and well known forms include \"Arkarua\", \"Charnia\", \"Dickinsonia\", \"Ediacaria\", \"Marywadea\", \"Onega\", \"Pteridinium\", and \"Yorgia\".\n\nThere is evidence that Earth's first mass extinction happened during this period when early animals changed the environment.\n\nThe relative proximity of the Moon at this time meant that tides were stronger and more rapid than they are now. The day was 21.9±0.4 hours, and there were 13.1±0.1 synodic months/year and 400±7 solar days/year.\n\nA few English language documentaries have featured the Ediacaran period and biota:\n\n\n"}

Since this interaction doesn't act to move the point charge itself, it doesn't contribute to the stored energy of the system.\n\nConsider bringing a point charge, \"q\", into its final position in the vicinity (neighbourhood) of a point charge, \"Q\".

It is located on the east banks of the Tapajós river roughly 300 km south of the city of Santarém. It was established by American industrialist Henry Ford in the Amazon Rainforest in 1928 as a prefabricated industrial town intended to be inhabited by 10,000 people to secure a source of cultivated rubber for the automobile manufacturing operations of the Ford Motor Company in the United States. Ford had negotiated a deal with the Brazilian government granting him a concession of of land on the banks of the Rio Tapajós near the city of Santarém, Brazil, in exchange for a 9% share in the profits generated. Ford's project failed, and the city was abandoned in 1934.\n\nThe town was mostly deserted, with only 90 residents still living in the city until the early 2000s when it saw an increase of population, being home to around 3,000 people .\n\nIn the 1920s, the Ford Motor Company sought to elude British monopoly over the supply of rubber, mainly used for producing tires and other car parts. Henry Ford looked for alternatives and a permanent place to establish a colony to produce rubber. Central America was considered; however, information about the rubber trees in the Amazon was uncovered and this, along with other factors, caused a change of plans.\n\nNegotiations with the Brazilian government started during the visit by then-governor of the State of Pará, to the United States to meet Ford. An agreement was signed and the American industrialist received an area of about 2.5 million acres (10,100 km) called \"Boa Vista\". The agreement exempted Ford from taxes on the exportation of goods produced in Brazil in exchange for 9% of the profits.\n\nWork on the area began in 1926 by the \"Companhia Ford Industrial do Brasil\". It was immediately hindered by poor logistics and diseases that affected the workers who succumbed to yellow fever and malaria. No roads were available in the area thus the area was only accessible by the Tapajós river. The site was developed as a planned community with different areas of the city being designated to the Brazilian workers and the American managers, who lived in the so-called American Village. Typical American houses were built, as were a hospital, school, library and hotel. The town also had a swimming pool, a playground, and a golf course.\n\nIn 1928, Ford Company sent two merchant ships – \"Lake Ormoc\" and \"Lake Farge\" – loaded with equipment and furnishings ranging from door knobs to the town's water tower. The town was then founded under the name Fordlândia.\n\nSeeking workers, several offices were opened in the cities of Belém and Manaus, and with the promise of good wages people of the nearby states answered.\n\nIn lower temperatures the latex is concentrated in the lower areas of the tree, as the temperature rises during the day the latex spreads throughout the tree, making the tapping less effective. Due to this, the typical journey of a rubber tapper began early in the morning, at around 5 am, ending at noon. The plantation was divided into areas and each worker was assigned to a different area to prevent workers from tapping the same trees successively.\n\nThe town had a strict set of rules imposed by the managers. Alcohol, women, tobacco and even football were forbidden within the town, including inside the workers' own homes. Inspectors would go from house to house to check how organised the houses were and to enforce these rules. The inhabitants circumvented these prohibitions by paddling out to merchant riverboats moored beyond town jurisdiction, often hiding contraband goods inside fruits like watermelons. A small settlement was established upstream on the \"Island of Innocence\" with bars, nightclubs and brothels.\n\nThe land was hilly, rocky and infertile. None of Ford's managers had the requisite knowledge of tropical agriculture. In the wild, the rubber trees grow apart from each other as a protection mechanism against plagues and diseases, often growing close to bigger trees of other species for added support. In Fordlândia, however, the trees were planted close together in plantations, easy prey for tree blight, sauva ants, lace bugs, red spiders, and leaf caterpillars.\n\nThe workers on the plantations were given unfamiliar food, such as hamburgers and canned food, and forced to live in American-style housing. Most disliked the way they were treated – being required to wear ID badges and work through the middle of the day under the tropical sun – and would often refuse to work.\n\nIn 1930, the native workers grew tired of the American food and revolted in the town's cafeteria. This became known as the \"Breaking Pans\" (Portuguese: \"Quebra-Panelas\"). The rebels proceeded to cut the telegraph wires and chased away the managers and even the town's cook into the jungle for a few days until the Brazilian Army arrived and the revolt ended. Agreements were then made on the type of food the workers would be served.\n\nThe government of Brazil was suspicious of any foreign investments, particularly in the northern Amazonian region, and offered little help. It wasn't long before the numerous problems began to take a toll on the project and the decision was made to relocate. Fordlândia was abandoned by the Ford Company in 1934, and the project was relocated downstream to Belterra, 40 km south of the city of Santarém, where better conditions to grow rubber existed. By 1945, synthetic rubber had been developed, reducing world demand for natural rubber. Ford's investment opportunity dried up overnight without producing any rubber for Ford's tires, and the second town was also abandoned. In 1945, Henry Ford's grandson Henry Ford II sold the area comprising both towns back to the Brazilian government for a loss of over US$20 million ($208 million 2013 dollars).\n\nIn spite of the huge investment and numerous invitations, Henry Ford never visited either of his ill-fated towns.\n\nBetween the 1950s and late 1970s, after being given back the rights to the lands, the Brazilian government, through its Ministry of Agriculture, installed several facilities in the area. The houses that once belonged to Ford's rubber tappers were then given to the families of the Ministry's employees, whose descendants still occupy them.\n\nThis project was also short-lived and left the city nearly completely abandoned upon reaching its end.\n\nThe town remained inhabited by roughly 90 people until the latter half of the 2000s. No basic services were offered in the area, with medical help only coming by boat in long intervals. That changed when people looking for places to live decided to go back into the town, often claiming houses. The town, now a district of Aveiro, is home to nearly 2,000 people as of 2017.\n\nMost of the original buildings still stand, with the exception of the hospital, which was dismantled by people looking for valuables.\n\nRegarded as the symbol of Fordlândia, the 50-meter high water tower is located by the main warehouses. As with most of the equipment in the town, it was built in Michigan and brought to Fordlândia by merchant ship. The water tower, water treatment plant and all of its original plumbing are still operational.\n\nThe hospital was left intact until the late 2000s, when people looking for valuables completely dismantled the hospital and removed its contents.\n\nBefore being dismantled, a number of controversies occurred regarding the hospital's X-ray machines. As a local TV station reported, several marked boxes containing radioactive material were left behind. This generated fears of contamination among the population of nearby cities, with people often mentioning the Goiânia accident, causing the authorities to remove the materials following an outcry.\n\nThe town had a sawmill responsible for providing lumber for all the construction around. The sawmill and kiln still stand; however, most equipment is gone.\n\nThe town's workshop was a three-story warehouse responsible for manufacturing parts for the machines working in the town. It still stands and has most of the original equipment. It is now used as a warehouse where most artifacts from Ford's era are kept. Hospital beds, equipment, a lead coffin and parts of an X-ray machine are stored in this warehouse.\n\nThe second floor of the warehouse was allowed to be used for the processing of seeds for a community project. The oil extracted from those seeds greatly accelerated the rotting of the wooden floor which has collapsed in some areas.\n\nThe six houses in the American Village still had their original furniture, silverware and even clothes that were left behind when the town was deserted. The houses were claimed by locals and most items were sold or taken as souvenirs. One of the houses was lost to a fire.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The organization was initially strictly European in composition, including prominently English, French, German, Polish, and Italian labor leaders and political activists.\n\nThe International made its way to American soil in 1866 when Italian socialist Cesare Orsini, brother of an attempted assassin of Napoleon III, arrived in the United States in 1866 and attempted to organize an American section. Orsini managed to win the support of a number of a handful of émigré socialists in New York City, in addition to gaining a sympathetic hearing from several prominent political figures, including newspaper editor Horace Greeley, abolitionist orator Wendell Phillips, and radical Republican Senator Charles Sumner.\n\nAt the time of its establishment, the International was far from a revolutionary organization, seeking rather to advance the cause of labor through international cooperation of organized workers around a general program based upon the notions of liberty and justice. This somewhat tender trade unionist perspective was not universal among its members, however, as from the outset it gained the participation of German émigrés Karl Marx and Frederick Engels and many of their co-thinkers, for whom the purpose of the IWA were not the modest goals of raising wages, lowering working hours, and liberalizing election law through international cooperation, but rather the construction of an international organization as a tool for the winning of state power from the bourgeoisie.\n\nIn this era of imperfect transatlantic communications the message of the IWA was spread through personal communication, with parallel networks emerging between Karl Marx and his associates on the one hand and the official \"American Corresponding Secretary\" of the General Council of the IWA in London. In effect these parallel channels of communication replicated the factional divisions of the European organization. The tension between labor-reformist and revolutionary visions of the IWA would find reflection in the factional warfare within the organization in America. Andrew Cameron was a delegate of the National Labor Union who attended the Basle Congress (1869).\n\nIn December 1867 a first step towards formal organization on behalf of the International took place in New York City when a call was issued for a meeting to be held the next month at the Germania Assembly Rooms, located in the city's Bowery district. Those calling the meeting were activists in the German-American labor movement. This event was held successfully and served as the foundation convention for an independent political party known as the Social Party of New York and Vicinity.\n\nThe Social Party adopted a platform which incorporated elements both of the program of the International as well as that of the fledgling National Labor Union (NLU) established less than two years earlier by William H. Sylvis. The group elected parallel Executive Boards, one each for its German-speaking and English-speaking membership. These two executive bodies cooperated in naming and running a ticket for city political office in the election of 1868. This effort was met with voter apathy, however, and the first campaign of the Social Party of New York also proved to be its last.\n\nFollowing the 1868 electoral failure, the Social Party of New York dissolved and its leading German-speaking members established a new organization called the \"Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein\" (General German Workers' Association). This group had an unabashed international socialist orientation and was later recalled by Friedrich Sorge to have consisted \"almost exclusively\" of \"plain wage-workers of every possible trade.\"\n\nIn February 1869, shortly after its formation, the \"Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein\" was admitted to the National Labor Union as \"Labor Union No. 5 of New York.\" The group sent delegates to the 1869 and 1870 national conventions of the NLU, but withdrew from the organization immediately after the 1870 conclave.\n\nIn the fall of 1869, the \"Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein,\" also known as Labor Union No. 5 of New York, affiliated as a group with the International Workingmen's Association, becoming \"Section No. 1 of New York.\" The group would not only become the bulwark of the International in America, but it would ultimately outlive the International itself, terminating only in 1874, two years after the death of the International.\n\nSection 1 maintained contacts with various trade unions in New York City and around the country and was instrumental in helping to establish new sections of the International. Early in 1870 a French-speaking section was established in New York City, with a Czech-speaking section following the fall of that same year.\n\nCommunication between the executive of the International in London and the American movement was fragmented, with American sections speaking one or another language communicating directly with corresponding secretaries in that language in London — a situation which was deemed as contributing to factional rivalry and personal animosity. It was deemed desirable that a single Central Committee should be established in the United States to smooth the transmission of official communications to and from London. On October 2, 1870 a joint meeting of the German and French sections of New York City voted to accept the London Council's plan.\n\nThis was followed in December 1870 by the formal launch of the \"Central Committee of the International Workingmen's Association for North America\" by the German, French, and Czech sections. Within six months this body would include representatives of 10 sections of the International, including 8 from New York City and 2 from Chicago. This would be the formal governing body of the IWA in America.\n\nThe IWA was not geographically limited to New York City and its environs. In actual fact the first formal section of the International was established in the West Coast city of San Francisco in March 1869. Within a year supporters of the International were playing a role in the movement for the 8-hour day in San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and New York.\n\nGrowth of the IWA in America was spurred enormously by the launch of the Paris Commune on March 26, 1871. Vilified by the conservative press, iconoclasts and radicals of all stripes in America rallied to the revolutionary city government of Paris, which was closely linked with the International Workingmen's Association in the public mind, if not in actual practice. Although the Parisian barricades were overrun by defenders of the old regime in May amidst a bloody reaction that claimed as many as 20,000 lives, the French events nevertheless occupied the thinking of a generation in much in the same way that the Russian Revolution of 1917 would have a polarizing and far reaching impact nearly half a century later.\n\nWhile most of the American press denounced the revolutionaries of Paris, radical reformers took up the revolutionary vision in the pages of their own journals. The \"National Anti-Slavery Standard\" carried regular dispatches from Paris and kept its readers informed of the legal and political retribution levied against Commune leaders in the aftermath of the failed uprising. The Boston magazine \"Commonwealth,\" established by a Southern abolitionist minister, likewise defended the Commune in its pages. So, too, did radical abolitionist Wendell Phillips, who declared, \"There is no hope for France but in the Reds.\"\n\nIn addition to the abolitionist movement, an additional source of broad support for the goals and methods of the Paris Commune came via various newspapers associated with the Spiritualist movement. The largest Spiritualist weekly, \"Banner of Light,\" attempted to explain for its readers the motivations and actions of the Communards, declaring they were \"weary of the servitude that practically accompanies the wages condition, when all exercise of political power is denied it.\"\n\nBy September 1871 there were 19 sections of the International in the USA, of which 3 were \"American\" and 16 were non-English speaking. Eight more sections were added the next month and another 7 in November. By the end of 1871 the IWA in America included a total of about 35 sections, including groups in Philadelphia, Washington, DC, St. Louis, New Orleans, Newark, New Jersey, and Springfield, Massachusetts, among other places.\n\nWhile no hard membership data is extant, scholarly estimates of the total number of American participants have generally clustered in the vicinity of 5,000, Samuel Bernstein, perhaps the most careful scholar of the subject, indicates that total membership \"very likely did not go beyond 4,000, after the increase in the first part of 1872.\"\n\nThe French events also seem to have helped radicalize Victoria Woodhull and her sister Tennessee Claflin, editors in 1870 of the eclectic \"Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly.\" Woodhull and Claflin were daughters of a religious revivalist mother and a father reckoned by his contemporaries as a grifter; Victoria had attempted to escape through marriage at age 15, while Tennessee had been exploited as a purported psychic healer and namesake of a homebrewed quack remedy concocted by her parents, \"Miss Tennessee's Magnetio Life Elixir for Beautifying the Complexion and Cleansing the Blood.\"\n\nFollowing Victoria's divorce from her drunken and philandering first husband, the pair set up shop as \"Tennessee Claflin and Victoria Woodhull, Clairvoyants\" and managed to stack up a substantial nest egg from gullible believers. Their list of satisfied clients ultimately included among them none other than Cornelius Vanderbilt, one of the country's richest men.\n\nBacked with Vanderbilt's cash through silent partnership, in 1870 the sisters Woodhull and Claflin had become stockbrokers, establishing the first brokerage managed by women up to that date. It was with the profits from Woodhull, Claflin & Co. that \"Woodhull and Claflin's Weekly\" had sprung. The paper's reformist political line, was pumped up and made profitable with a sensationalistic approach and a hyperbolic writing style. Covering a broad range of subjects running the gamut from abolitionism to feminism to labor reform to Spiritualism, in 1871 the paper dedicated significant coverage to the Paris Commune and the entity commonly imagined to be behind it, the IWA.\n\nThe paper reprinted official documents of the International and ran an interview with Karl Marx himself, with Marx returning the favor by providing the controversial female editors with a first-hand account by his daughter Jenny of her expulsion from France. It was an unlikely vehicle for the social revolution and the opportunistic sisters with their unconventional lifestyle deeply alienated the German international socialists of Section 1.\n\nWoodhull and Claflin were instrumental in the organization of a second English-language branch of the International in New York City, IWA Branch 12, making use of the newspaper's office as a meeting location. Section 12 attracted a wide range of dissident intellectuals, including in the first place tinsmith and abolitionist William West. Also active in Section 12 was Stephen Pearl Andrews, an abolitionist who had previously established a failed utopian socialist community on Long Island called \"Modern Times.\" Andrews had later established a commune on Manhattan called \"Unitary Home\" and had with his wife launched a political group called the New Democracy, members of which went on to help launch Sections 9 and 12 of the IWA in New York City.\n\nA sharp difference of opinion emerged between the committed centralists of German-speaking Branch 1 of New York City and the predominantly middle class English-speaking Branches 9, 12, and 26 — with Branch 12 in the leading role. These latter have been described by historian Samuel Bernstein as \"American autonomists,\" who\n\"by reason of faith in their respective blueprints of what America ought to be, counted first, on the spread of enlightenment and the democratic process to cleanse government of corruption, and then, on meliorative laws to direct the nation toward their primal model. Thus a boundary divided autonomists; but they lined up together against centralized authority.\"\n\nSection 12 disputed the authority of the Central Committee, dominated by Section 1, writing a letter to the General Council in London in the fall of 1871 calling for it to take control over the entire American movement. Section 12 had its friends on the General Council, including general secretary John Hales and corresponding secretary for the United States George Eccarius. It pushed forward with its own program of eclectic social reform in 1872, bringing a protest from the doctrinaire international socialists of Section 1, who demanded the suspension from the organization for their ideological heresy of their erstwhile comrades.\n\nA fight for control of the American movement ensured, with Section 1 in the minority, supported by most of the German and the Irish sections, with Section 12 winning the American, two of the German, and most of the French sections for its program. In response, Section 1 and its supporters split the IWA, establishing a new governing body called the Federal Council. Both Section 12 and Section 1 appealed to the General Council in London to resolve the dispute. In March 1872 the General Council issued its ruling, suspending Section 12 from the organization and ordering the two rival executive bodies to unite into a single provisional committee pending formal resolution at the next national convention.\n\nSection 12 continued an independent existence, ultimately convening its own convention at the Apollo Theater in New York City. This gathering nominated a ticket headed by Victoria Woodhull as its candidate for President of the United States.\n\nThe main body of the IWA opened its 1st National Convention in New York on July 6, 1872, with representatives of 22 sections in attendance. The gathering adopted a new formal name for the American organization — the North American Federation of the International Workingmen's Association — as well as compiling a new set of organizational bylaws.\n\nThe Americans were not the only national division of the International fighting a factional war for control of the organization. The General Council, which had long been divided between moderate trade union reformers and international socialist revolutionaries, was becoming the object of a still greater fight — a battle between anarchists and socialists. More than an ideological battle, this struggle also fell into the realm of personal antipathy between the primary leaders of the two wings, the German émigré Karl Marx and the Russian émigré Mikhail Bakunin.\n\nMarx saw a socialist future as the inevitable result of a process of economic growth and development, with the revolutionary transformation making it possible conducted by an educated and disciplined working class led by a political party. In the view of Bakunin, the new world would emerge via the revolt of the poor and oppressed masses, workers and peasant farmers alike, suffering under the heel of an exploitative semi-feudal economic and political structure. Bakunin was contemptuous of the educated industrial workers favored by Marx, believing they were \"infected with a bourgeois outlook,\" and instead favored an alliance of radical intellectuals, the peasant masses, as well as the most impoverished and unwashed workers of the cities. \n\nBakunin rejected the coordinated trade union and political action favored by the international socialists, instead professing the expedience and necessity of the armed uprising. He sought the forcible destruction of state power and its replacement with what historian Juilius Braunthal has characterized as a \"stateless federation of communes free from all outside coercion and authority.\" Marx, on the other hand, saw a long process of education and organization as a necessary precursor for a revolutionary overthrow of the ruling class, followed by a \"withering away\" of the coercive state in the new non-exploitative world. In short, Bakunin and Marx agreed upon little, rejected the fundamental ideas of the other, and saw themselves as antagonistic rivals locked in a irreconcilable conflict for control of the fledgling IWA organization.\n\n"}

{"id": "103194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=103194", "title": "Leidenfrost effect", "text": "Leidenfrost effect\n\nThe Leidenfrost effect is a physical phenomenon in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than the liquid's boiling point, produces an insulating vapor layer keeping that liquid from boiling rapidly. Because of this 'repulsive force', a droplet hovers over the surface rather than making physical contact with it. This is most commonly seen when cooking: one sprinkles drops of water in a pan to gauge its temperature: if the pan's temperature is at or above the Leidenfrost point, the water skitters across the pan and takes longer to evaporate than in a pan with a temperature below the Leidenfrost point but still above boiling. It is named after Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost, who discussed it in \"A Tract About Some Qualities of Common Water\" in 1751.\n\nThe effect is responsible for the ability of liquid nitrogen to skitter across floors. It also allows a person to dip a wet finger in molten lead, or blow out a mouthful of liquid nitrogen, without injury. The latter is potentially lethal, particularly should one accidentally swallow the liquid nitrogen.\n\nThe effect can be seen as drops of water are sprinkled onto a pan at various times as it heats up. Initially, as the temperature of the pan is just below , the water flattens out and slowly evaporates, or if the temperature of the pan is well below , the water stays liquid. As the temperature of the pan goes above , the water droplets hiss when touching the pan and these droplets evaporate quickly. Later, as the temperature exceeds the Leidenfrost point, the Leidenfrost effect comes into play. On contact with the pan, the water droplets bunch up into small balls of water and skitter around, lasting much longer than when the temperature of the pan was lower. This effect works until a much higher temperature causes any further drops of water to evaporate too quickly to cause this effect.\n\nThis is because at temperatures above the Leidenfrost point, the bottom part of the water droplet vaporizes immediately on contact with the hot pan. The resulting gas suspends the rest of the water droplet just above it, preventing any further direct contact between the liquid water and the hot pan. As steam has much poorer thermal conductivity than the metal pan, further heat transfer between the pan and the droplet is slowed down dramatically. This also results in the drop being able to skid around the pan on the layer of gas just under it.\n\nThe temperature at which the Leidenfrost effect begins to occur is not easy to predict. Even if the volume of the drop of liquid stays the same, the Leidenfrost point may be quite different, with a complicated dependence on the properties of the surface, as well as any impurities in the liquid. Some research has been conducted into a theoretical model of the system, but it is quite complicated. As a very rough estimate, the Leidenfrost point for a drop of water on a frying pan might occur at .\n\nThe effect was also described by the eminent Victorian steam boiler designer, Sir William Fairbairn, in reference to its effect on massively reducing heat transfer from a hot iron surface to water, such as within a boiler. In a pair of lectures on boiler design, he cited the work of Pierre Hippolyte Boutigny (1798-1884) and Professor Bowman of King's College, London in studying this. A drop of water that was vaporized almost immediately at persisted for 152 seconds at . Lower temperatures in a boiler firebox might evaporate water more quickly as a result; compare Mpemba effect. An alternative approach was to increase the temperature beyond the Leidenfrost point. Fairbairn considered this too, and may have been contemplating the flash steam boiler, but considered the technical aspects insurmountable for the time.\n\nThe Leidenfrost point may also be taken to be the temperature for which the hovering droplet lasts longest.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that it is possible to stabilize the Leidenfrost vapour layer of water by exploiting superhydrophobic surfaces. In this case, once the vapour layer is established, cooling never collapses the layer, and no nucleate boiling occurs; the layer instead slowly relaxes until the surface is cooled.\n\nLeidenfrost effect has been used for the development of high sensitivity ambient mass spectrometry. Under the influence of Leidenfrost condition the Levitating droplet does not release molecules out and the molecules are enriched inside the droplet. At the last moment of droplet evaporation all of the enriched molecules release in a short time domain and thus increase the sensitivity.\n\nA heat engine based on the Leidenfrost effect has been prototyped. It has the advantage of extremely low friction.\n\nThe Leidenfrost point signifies the onset of stable film boiling. It represents the point on the boiling curve where the heat flux is at the minimum and the surface is completely covered by a vapor blanket. Heat transfer from the surface to the liquid occurs by conduction and radiation through the vapor. In 1756, Leidenfrost observed that water droplets supported by the vapor film slowly evaporate as they move about on the hot surface. As the surface temperature is increased, radiation through the vapor film becomes more significant and the heat flux increases with increasing excess temperature.\n\nThe minimum heat flux for a large horizontal plate can be derived from Zuber's equation,\n\n<math>_{min}}=C\n"}

This section of the Act replaces the biodiversity duty originally outlined in Section 42 of the NERC Act 2006 for both England and Wales.\n\nAwareness of the presence of any priority habitat or priority species identified on these lists is of importance within the local authority planning process when land is considered for development. Along with legally protected species, as well as statutory and non-statutory sites, knowledge of the presence of priority habitats and priority species is required if the impact of future development is to be avoided or mitigated. Planning Policy Wales indicates that, when determining planning applications, the existence of priority habitats are of greater status than others. By fully considering all these features in the decision-making process, a planning authority will have demonstrated that it has discharged its duty to conserve biodiversity.\n\nThe list shows the broad habitat group, followed by name of the habitat of 'principal importance'.\n\n\n\nList of species and habitats of principal importance in England\n"}

A few palms are native to higher elevations of south Asia where true winter conditions occur, while a few others are native to the warmer parts of the temperate zone in North America. A few of these temperate climate palms can tolerate hard freezes with little or no damage. Many of these \"hardy \" species can be cultivated in warmer parts of temperate climates.\n\nThe hardiest species are found in the genera \"Rhapidophyllum\", \"Sabal\", and \"Trachycarpus\". Members of these and other genera are sometimes grown in areas where they are not truly hardy, overwintering with the aid of various kinds of artificial protection.\n\nThe minimum temperature a palm can sustain depends on a variety of factors, such as humidity, size and age of the palm, daytime high temperatures, or the length of time the temperature is at the minimum. A week of high temperatures below will do far more damage to a palm than an overnight low of for an hour or so.\n\nThe fan palms (Arecaceae tribe Corypheae; palms with fan-shaped leaves) include all of the hardiest palms.\n\nIn the United States \"Trachycarpus\" is cultivated along the Pacific coast and as far north as Seattle, and along the Atlantic coast as far north as Long Island, New York/coastal Connecticut. Across the interior of the United States, there are reports of long term specimens that have survived north to the Ohio River, with several long term plantings in Tennessee and western North Carolina. It appears that areas west of the Mississippi River (the southern Plains) may be too hot in summer for successful long term cultivation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFew palms with pinnate leaves tolerate much frost. They belong to several tribes of the Arecaceae, with the species listed here belonging to Tribe Areceae (\"Chamaedorea\"), Tribe Cocoseae (\"Butia, Jubaea\") and Tribe Phoeniceae (\"Phoenix\").\n\n\nSome plants used in subtropical landscaping in temperate climates like much of Europe, northern China/Japan, Korea, the northern USA, New Zealand, etc. that are commonly referred to as \"palms\", but are not palms, i.e. not members of the Arecaceae family, include: yuccas, \"Aloidendron barberae\", \"Cordyline australis\", \"Cordyline indivisa\", \"Cycas revoluta\", \"Macrozamia communis\", \"Macrozamia johnsonii\", \"Macrozamia riedlei\", \"Cyathea australis\", \"Cyathea capensis\", \"Cyathea cooperi\", \"Cyathea dealbata\", \"Cyathea medullaris\", \"Dicksonia antarctica\", \"Dicksonia squarrosa\", \"Pseudopanax ferox\", and occasionally the sumac \"Rhus typhina\".\n\nIn general, hardy palms can only tolerate \"brief\" periods with temperatures in the range . As such, this generally limits hardy palm cultivation and long term specimens to zone 7a or higher. Some hardy palms can be cultivated in areas with low temperatures slightly below this range when given wind sheltering (planted on the south side of a building). In the USA, hardy palm cultivation is generally attempted from USDA zones 6b/7a southward.\n\nIn very cold winter areas below zone 6b, cold hardy palms have been cultivated by partially (or completely) covering plants with mini-green house coverings and wraps. Some garden enthusiasts in severe cold winter areas have gone as far as heating the interiors of these winter enclosures. As such, there are occasional reports of hardy palms be cultivated in areas with severe winters with low temperatures below .\n\n"}

{"id": "4490333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4490333", "title": "Load profile", "text": "Load profile\n\nIn electrical engineering, a load profile is a graph of the variation in the electrical load versus time. A load profile will vary according to customer type (typical examples include residential, commercial and industrial), temperature and holiday seasons. Power producers use this information to plan how much electricity they will need to make available at any given time. Teletraffic engineering uses a similar load curve.\n\nIn a power system, a load curve or load profile is a chart illustrating the variation in demand/electrical load over a specific time. Generation companies use this information to plan how much power they will need to generate at any given time. A load duration curve is similar to a load curve. The information is the same but is presented in a different form. These curves are useful in the selection of generator units for supplying electricity.\n\nIn an electricity distribution grid, the load profile of electricity usage is important to the efficiency and reliability of power transmission. The power transformer or battery-to-grid are critical aspects of power distribution and sizing and modelling of batteries or transformers depends on the load profile. The factory specification of transformers for the optimization of load losses versus no-load losses is dependent directly on the characteristics of the load profile that the transformer is expected to be subjected to. This includes such characteristics as average load factor, diversity factor, utilization factor, and demand factor, which can all be calculated based on a given load profile. \n\nOn the power market so-called EFA blocks are used to specify the traded forward contract (on the delivery of a certain amount of electrical energy at a certain time.\n\nIn retail energy markets, supplier obligations are settled on an hourly or subhourly basis. For most customers, consumption is measured on a monthly basis, based on meter reading schedules. Load profiles are used to convert the monthly consumption data into estimates of hourly or subhourly consumption in order to determine the supplier obligation. For each hour, these estimates are aggregated for all customers of an energy supplier, and the aggregate amount is used in market settlement calculations as the total demand that must be covered by the supplier.\n\nLoad profiles can be determined by direct metering but on smaller devices such as distribution network transformers this is not routinely done. Instead a load profile can be inferred from customer billing or other data. An example of a practical calculation used by utilities is using a transformer's maximum demand reading and taking into account the known number of each customer type supplied by these transformers. This process is called load research.\n\nActual demand can be collected at strategic locations to perform more detailed load analysis; this is beneficial to both distribution and end-user customers looking for peak consumption. Smart grid meters, utility meter load profilers, data logging sub-meters and portable data loggers are designed to accomplish this task by recording readings at a set interval.\n\n\n"}

The material appears yellowish-red in transmitted light and blue in the scattered light perpendicular to the transmitted light. The phenomenon is named after the appearance of opals and is an example of the Tyndall effect.\n\nThere are different degrees of opalescent behaviour. One can still see through a slightly opalescent phase. The larger the particles are, the stronger the scattering arising from them and the cloudier the particular phase will look. At a certain concentration the scattering is so strong that all light passing through is scattered, so that it is no longer transparent.\n\nExamples are the blue sky in the daytime and the yellowish-red sky at sunset. Another example can be made by adding a few droplets of milk to a glass of water. The liquid appears bluish. However, if one looks through the glass at a light source, it becomes yellowish-red.

Pendant bars are thin, sharp-crested deposits, and are typically made up of coarser sediment from the bed load. This type of bar is found on the downstream side of a weathering-resistant protrusion such as a large outcrop of bedrock, and is separated from the protrusion by a depression. \n\nPendant bars form as high-velocity floodwater moves around a protrusion. The water scours out a depression behind the protusion and deposits the sediment a short distance downstream in a bar-shaped formation. A similar process forms a sand splay, which is much like a shoal but is formed on floodplains or terraces in lower-intensity flooding episodes. Other fluvial features that are formed by bed load sediments are the point bar, longitudinal bar, and expansion bar.\n\n"}

The reserve straddles the Mexican states of Colima and Jalisco. It is located in the transition between the Nearctic and Neotropical realms and encompasses parts of the Sierra Madre del Sur, with a wide range of altitudes, climates and soils. The effects of tectonic and volcanic activities and erosion are notable within the reserve.\nForest types in the reserve including mesophytic, cloud, dry deciduous and semi-deciduous tropical forests. Anthropologists know the region as \"Zona de Occidente\", an area notably different to the rest of Mesoamerica. Some ceramic remnants, figurines and graves have been found, but there is little other material evidence of ancient human settlement. As of 1995 almost 8,000 people lived in the Sierra de Manantlán Reserve, engaged mainly in agriculture (corn, beans, tomatoes, sugar cane, watermelon, mangoes), livestock grazing, timber production, and extraction of wood for fuel and mining of coal or minerals. Another 30,000 lived in the surrounding communities and almost 700,000 in the surrounding region.\n\nThe Sierra de Manantlán Biosphere Reserve is located to the extreme north of the inter-tropical zone. The climate in the region is influenced by its proximity to the coast, the effect of its landform (orographic shade) and the breadth of its altitudinal range. These characteristics explain the high biodiversity and the presence of numerous plant formations ranging from tropical forests to temperate-cold climates.\n\nThe Sierra de Manantlán's varied and complex plant cover harbours a great wealth of flora. There are over 2900 species of vascular plants belonging to 981 genera. Wildlife is one of the important components of the high biodiversity in this reserve. Among the main values of the Sierra de Manantlán, in addition to its great wealth of species and its unique biogeographical characteristics, particular mention should be made of the presence of endangered or useful endemic species. So far 110 mammal species have been reported, including the Mexican vole subspecies \"Microtus mexicanus neveriae\", the pocket gopher \"Cratogeomys gymnurus russelli\", the oncilla, jaguarandi, ocelot, puma, bobcat, jaguar and four species of nectarivorous bats.\n\nThere are 336 bird species which have been reported, among them are 36 which are endemic to Mexico, such as the charismatic species: crested guan (\"Penelope purpurascens\"), military macaw (\"Ara militaris\"), red-lored amazon (\"Amazona autumnalis\") and the Mexican national symbol, the golden eagle. In terms of herpetofauna, 85 species have been recorded; of these 13 are endemic to the western and central region of Mexico: rattlesnake, black iguana, frog \"Shyrrhopus modestus\", beaded lizard (\"Heloderma horridum\") and the Autlan rattlesnake (\"Crotalus lannomi\"), an endemic species only reported for the area of Puerto de Los Mazos. Of the 16 species of fish identified, 13 are native and four are endemic to the region.\n\nMost plants in the list below can be found in \"Flora de Manantlán\", and that should be assumed as a reference when no other is indicated.

Human responses to the sea can be found in artforms including literature, art, poetry, film, theatre, and classical music. The earliest art representing boats is 40,000 years old. Since then, artists in different countries and cultures have depicted the sea. Symbolically, the sea has been perceived as a hostile environment populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology. In the works of the psychiatrist Carl Jung, the sea symbolises the personal and the collective unconscious in dream interpretation.\n\nThe sea and ships have been depicted in art ranging from simple drawings on the walls of huts in Lamu to seascapes by Joseph Turner and Dutch Golden Age painting. The Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created colour prints of the moods of the sea, including \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\". The sea has appeared in literature since Homer's \"Odyssey\" (8th century BC). The sea is a recurring theme in the Haiku poems of the Japanese Edo period poet Matsuo Bashō (松尾 芭蕉) (1644–1694).\n\nThe sea plays a major role in Homer's epic poem the \"Odyssey\", describing the ten-year voyage of the Greek hero Odysseus who struggles to return home across the sea, encountering sea monsters along the way. In the Middle Ages, the sea appears in romances such as the Tristan legend, with motifs such as mythical islands and self-propelled ships. Pilgrimage is a common theme in stories and poems such as \"The Book of Margery Kempe\".\n\nContemporary sea-inspired novels have been written by Joseph Conrad, Herman Wouk, and Herman Melville; poems about the sea have been written by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Rudyard Kipling and John Masefield. The sea has inspired much music over the centuries including sea shanties, Richard Wagner's \"The Flying Dutchman\", Claude Debussy's \"La mer\" (1903–05), Charles Villiers Stanford's \"Songs of the Sea\" (1904) and \"Songs of the Fleet\" (1910), Edward Elgar's \"Sea Pictures\" (1899) and Ralph Vaughan Williams' \"A Sea Symphony\" (1903–1909). Burial at sea has been practised in various ways by countries around the world since the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome.\n\nHuman reactions to the sea are found in, for example, literature, art, poetry, film, theatre, and classical music, as well as in mythology and the psychotherapeutic interpretation of dreams. The importance of the sea to maritime nations is shown by the intrusions it makes into their culture; its inclusion in myth and legend; its mention in proverbs and folk song; the use of ships in votive offerings; the importance of ships and the sea in initiation ceremonies and in mortuary rites; children playing with toy boats; adults making model ships; crowds gathering at the launch of a new ship; people congregating at the arrival or departure of a vessel and the general attitude towards maritime matters. Trade and exchange of ideas with neighbouring nations is one of the means by which civilizations advance and evolve. This happened widely among the ancient peoples living in lands bordering the Mediterranean Sea, as well as in India, China and other Southeast Asian nations. The World Oceans Day takes place every 8 June.\n\nPetroglyphs depicting boats made of papyrus are among rock art dating back 40,000 years on the shores of the Caspian Sea. \nJames Hornell studied traditional, indigenous watercraft and considered the significance of the \"oculi\" or eyes painted on the prows of boats which may have represented the watchful gaze of a god or goddess protecting the vessel. The Vikings portrayed fierce heads with open jaws and bulging eyes at bow and stern of their longships to ward off evil spirits, and the figureheads on the prows of sailing ships were regarded with affection by mariners and represented the belief that the vessel needed to find its way. The Egyptians placed figures of holy birds on the prow while the Phoenicians used horses representing speed. The Ancient Greeks used boars' heads to symbolise acute vision and ferocity while Roman boats often mounted a carving of a centurion representing valour in battle. In northern Europe, serpents, bulls, dolphins and dragons were customary used to decorate ships' prows and by the thirteenth century, the swan was commonly used to signify grace and mobility.\n\nSymbolically, the sea has long been perceived as a hostile and dangerous environment populated by fantastic creatures: the gigantic Leviathan of the Bible, the shark-like Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the ship-swallowing Kraken of late Norse mythology.\nThe Greek mythology of the sea includes a complex pantheon of gods and other supernatural creatures. The god of the sea, Poseidon, is accompanied by his wife, Amphitrite, who is one of the fifty Nereids, sea nymphs whose parents were Nereus and Doris. The Tritons, sons of Poseidon, who were variously represented with the tails of fish or seahorses, formed Poseidon's retinue along with the Nereids. The mythic sea was further peopled by dangerous sea monsters such as Scylla. Poseidon himself had something of the shifting character of the sea, presiding not only over the sea, but also earthquakes, storms and horses. Neptune occupied a similar position in Roman mythology. Another Greek sea-god, Proteus, specifically embodies the domain of sea change, the adjectival form \"protean\" meaning mutable, able to assume many forms. Shakespeare makes use of this in \"Henry VI, Part 3\", where Richard III boasts \"I can add colors to the chameleon, Change shapes with Proteus for advantages\".\n\nIn Southeast Asia, the importance of the sea gave rise to many myths of epic ocean voyages, princesses on distant islands, monsters and magical fish lurking in the deep. In Northern Europe, kings were sometimes given ship burials when the body was laid in a vessel surrounded by treasure and costly cargo and set adrift on the sea. In North America, various creation stories have a duck or other creature dive to the bottom of the sea and bring up some mud out of which the dry land was formed. Atargatis was a Syrian deity known as the mermaid-goddess and Sedna was the goddess of the sea and marine animals in Inuit mythology.\nIn Norse mythology Ægir was the sea god and Rán, his wife, was the sea goddess while Njörðr was the god of sea travel. It was best to propitiate the gods before setting out on a voyage.\n\nIn the works of the psychiatrist Carl Jung, the sea symbolizes the personal and the collective unconscious in dream interpretation:\n\nThe sea and ships have been depicted in art ranging from simple drawings of dhows on the walls of huts in Lamu to seascapes by Joseph Turner. The genre of marine art became especially important in the paintings of the Dutch Golden Age, with works showing the Dutch navy at the peak of its military prowess. Artists such as Jan Porcellis, Simon de Vlieger, Jan van de Cappelle, Hendrick Dubbels, Willem van de Velde the Elder and his son, Ludolf Bakhuizen and Reinier Nooms created maritime paintings in a wide variety of styles. The Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created colour prints of the moods of the sea, including \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\" showing the destructive force of the sea at the same time as its ever-changing beauty. The 19th century Romantic artist Ivan Aivazovsky created some 6,000 paintings, the majority of which depict the sea.\n\nThe sea has appeared in literature since at least the time of the Ancient Greek poet Homer who describes it as the \"wine dark sea\" (oînops póntos). In his epic poem the \"Odyssey\", written in the 8th century BC, he describes the ten-year voyage of the Greek hero Odysseus who struggles to return home across the sea after the war with Troy described in the \"Iliad\". His wandering voyage takes him from one strange and dangerous land to another, experiencing among other maritime hazards shipwreck, the sea-monster Scylla, the whirlpool Charybdis and the island Ogygia of the delightful nymph Calypso.\n\nThe soldier Xenophon, in his \"Anabasis\", told how he witnessed the roaming 10,000 Greeks, lost in enemy territory, seeing the Black Sea from Mount Theches, after participating in Cyrus the Younger's failed march against the Persian Empire in 401 BC. The 10,000 joyfully shouted \"\"Thálatta! Thálatta!\" \"() — \"The Sea! The Sea!\" The famous shout has come to symbolise victory, national freedom, triumph over hardship, and more romantically the \"longing for a return to the primal sea.\"\nThe sea is a recurring theme in the Haiku poems of the leading Japanese Edo period poet Matsuo Bashō (松尾 芭蕉) (1644–1694).\n\nPtolemy, writing in his \"Geographia\" in about 150 AD, described how the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean were great enclosed seas and believed that a vessel venturing into the Atlantic would soon reach the countries of the East. His map of the then known world was remarkably accurate but from the fourth century onwards, civilisation suffered a setback at the hands of barbarian invaders and knowledge of geography took a backward step. In the seventh century, Isidore of Seville produced a \"wheel map\" in which Asia, Africa and Europe were arranged like segments in an orange, separated by the \"Mare Mediterranean\", \"Nilus\" and \"Tanais\" and surrounded by \"Oceanus\". It was not until the fifteenth century that Ptolemy's maps were used again and Henry the Navigator of Portugal initiated ocean exploration and maritime research. Encouraged by him, Portuguese navigators explored, mapped and charted the west coast of Africa and the Eastern Atlantic and this knowledge prepared the way for the great voyages of exploration that were to follow.\n\nMedieval literature offers rich encounters with the sea, as in the well-known romance of Tristan and \"The Voyage of Saint Brendan\". The sea acts as an arbiter of good and evil and the barrier of fate, as in the mercantilist fifteenth-century poem \"The Libelle of Englyshe Polycye\". Medieval romances frequently ascribe a prominent role to the sea. The originally Mediterranean family of Apollonius of Tyre romances use the Odyssean format of the extended sea voyage. The story may have influenced \"Guillaume Roi d'Angleterre\" and Chaucer’s The Man of Law's Tale. Other romances, such as the \"Romance of Horn\", the \"Conte del Graal\" of Chrétien de Troyes, \"Partonopeu de Blois\" or the Tristan legend employ the sea as a structural feature and source of motifs: setting adrift, mythical islands, and self-propelled ships. Some of these maritime motifs appear in the lais of Marie de France. Many religious works written in the Middle Ages reflect on the sea. The ascetic sea desert (\"heremum in oceano\") appears in Adomnán’s \"Life of Columba\" or \"The Voyage of Saint Brendan\", an entirely seaborne tale cognate with the Irish \"immram\" or maritime pilgrimage tale. The Old English poem \"The Seafarer\" has a similar background. Sermons sometimes speak of the sea of the world and the ship of the Church, and moralistic interpretations of shipwreck and floods. These motifs in chronicles such as the \"Chronica majora\" of Matthew Paris, and Adam of Bremen’s \"History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen\". Similar motives are treated in Biblical paraphrases, e.g. the anonymous Middle English poem \"Patience\", and pilgrimage narratives and poems such as \"The Book of Margery Kempe\", Saewulf's \"Voyage\", \"The Pilgrims' Sea Voyage\". Marian devotion created prayers to Mary as the Star of the Sea (\"stella maris\"), both as lyrics and as features in larger works like John Gower's \"Vox Clamantis\".\n\nWilliam Shakespeare makes frequent and complex use of mentions of the sea and things associated with it. The following, from Ariel's Song in Act I, Scene ii of \"The Tempest\", is felt to be \"wonderfully evocative\", indicating a \"profound transformation\":\n\nOther early modern authors to have made use of the cultural associations of the sea include John Milton in his poem \"Lycidas\" (1637), Andrew Marvell in his \"Bermudas\" (1650) and Edmund Waller in his \"The Battle of the Summer Islands\" (1645). The scholar Steven Mentz argues that \"the oceans .. figure the boundaries of human transgression; they function symbolically as places in the world into which mortal bodies cannot safely go\". In Mentz's view, the European exploration of the oceans in the fifteenth century caused a shift in the meanings of the sea. Whereas a garden symbolised happy coexistence with nature, life was threatened at sea: the ocean counterbalanced the purely pastoral.\n\nIn modern times, the novelist Joseph Conrad wrote several sea-inspired books including \"Lord Jim\" and \"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'\" which drew on his experience as a captain in the merchant navy. The American novelist Herman Wouk writes that \"Nobody, but nobody, could write about storms at sea like Conrad\". One of Wouk's own marine novels, \"The Caine Mutiny\" (1952), won the Pulitzer Prize. Herman Melville's 1851 novel \"Moby-Dick\" was described by the poet John Masefield as speaking \"the whole secret of the sea\".\n\nA large seabird, the albatross, played a central part in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's influential 1798 poem \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", which in turn gave rise to the usage of albatross as metaphor for a burden. In his 1902 poem \"The Sea and the Hills\", Rudyard Kipling expresses the urge for the sea, and uses alliteration to suggest the sea's sound and rhythms: \"Who hath desired the Sea?—the sight of salt water unbounded— The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber wind-hounded?\" John Masefield also felt the pull of the sea in his \"Sea Fever\", writing \"I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky.\" The Argentine Jorge Luis Borges wrote the 1964 poem \"El mar\" (\"The Sea\"), treating it as something that constantly regenerates the world and the people who contemplate it, and that is very close to the essence of being human.\n\nNumerous books and films have taken war at sea as their subject, often dealing with real or fictionalised incidents in the Second World War. Nicholas Monsarrat's 1951 novel \"The Cruel Sea\" follows the lives of a group of Royal Navy sailors fighting the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II; it was made into a 1952 film of the same name. The novelist Herman Wouk, reviewing \"five best nautical yarns\", writes that \"\"The Cruel Sea\" was a major best seller and became a hit movie starring Jack Hawkins. Its authenticity is unmistakable ... His description of a torpedoed crew, terrified, clinging to life rafts in the blackest of nights, is, indeed, too authoritative for comfort—we soon feel ourselves in that sea.\" Anthony Asquith used a dramatised documentary style in his 1943 film \"We Dive at Dawn\", while Noël Coward and David Lean's 1942 \"In Which We Serve\" combined information with drama. Pat Jackson's 1944 \"Western Approaches\" was, unusually for the time, shot in Technicolor, at sea in rough weather and sometimes actually in battle. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's 1956 \"The Battle of the River Plate\" tells a tale of \"gentlemanly gallantry\" of the scuttling of the \"Admiral Graf Spee\". A very different message, of \"duplicitous diplomacy [and] flawed intelligence\" is the theme of Richard Fleischer, Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku's $22 million epic \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\" (1970). Depicting an earlier era of naval warfare in the age of sail, Peter Weir's 2003 \"\", based on Patrick O'Brian's series of Aubrey-Maturin novels.\nSubmarine films like Robert Wise's 1958 \"Run Silent, Run Deep\" constitute a distinctive subgenre of the war film, depicting the stress of submarine warfare. The genre makes distinctive use of the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in the 1981 \"Das Boot\", the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges and the many times repeated ping of sonar, as well as the threatening sounds of a destroyer's propellor and of an approaching torpedo.\n\nA sailor's work was hard in the days of sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical instruments or joined in unison to sing folksongs such as the mid-eighteenth century ballad \"The Mermaid\", a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many repetitive tasks, such as turning the capstan to raise the anchor and heaving on ropes to raise and lower the sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors joining in the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.\n\nThe sea has inspired much music over the centuries. In Oman, Fanun Al Bahr (Sea Music) is played by an ensemble with kaser, rahmani and msindo drums, s'hal cymbals, tassa tin drums, and mismar bagpipes; the piece called Galfat Shobani plays through the work of renewing the caulking of a wooden ship. Richard Wagner stated that his 1843 opera \"The Flying Dutchman\" was inspired by a memorable sea crossing from Riga to London, his ship being delayed in the Norwegian fjords at Tvedestrand for two weeks by storms. The French composer Claude Debussy's 1903–05 work \"La mer\" (\"The Sea\"), completed at Eastbourne on the English Channel coast, evokes the sea with \"a multitude of water figurations\". Other works composed at about this time include Charles Villiers Stanford's \"Songs of the Sea\" (1904) and \"Songs of the Fleet\" (1910), Edward Elgar's \"Sea Pictures\" (1899) and Ralph Vaughan Williams' choral work, \"A Sea Symphony\" (1903–1909). The English composer Frank Bridge wrote an orchestral suite called \"The Sea\" in 1911, also completed at Eastbourne. \"Four Sea Interludes\" (1945) is an orchestral suite by Benjamin Britten that forms part of his opera \"Peter Grimes\".\n\nThe burial of entire or cremated bodies at sea has been practised by countries around the world since ancient times, with instances recorded from the ancient civilisations in Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Practices vary by country and by religion; for example, the United States allows human remains to be buried at sea at least 3 nautical miles from land, and if the remains are uncremated the water must be at least 600 feet deep, while in Islam burial by lowering a weighted clay vessel into the sea is permitted when a person dies on a ship.\n\nThe following books are useful on many aspects of the topic.\n\n"}
{"id": "40207546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40207546", "title": "Shale gas in the United Kingdom", "text": "Shale gas in the United Kingdom\n\nShale gas in the United Kingdom has attracted increasing attention since 2007, when onshore shale gas production was proposed. The first shale gas well in England was drilled in 1875. A number of wells have been drilled, and favourable tax treatment has been offered to shale gas producers.\n\nIn July 2013 UK Prime Minister David Cameron had claimed that, \"fracking has real potential to drive energy bills down\". However, in November 2013 representatives from industry and government, such as former BP Chief Executive and government advisor Lord Browne, Energy Secretary Ed Davey and economist Lord Stern said that fracking in the UK alone will not lower prices as the UK is part of a well connected European market.\n, there has been no commercial production of shale gas in the UK. \n\nThe Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) originally identified large areas of eastern and southern England as having the \"best shale gas potential\": However the British Geological Survey report released in October 2014 said that there was little potential for shale gas in the Weald Basin as the field has not yet reached thermal maturation, however may exhibit oil-shale potential. (see 'Weald Basin' below)\n\nAs of June 2013, the Bowland Basin was the only area in the UK where wells have been drilled specifically for shale gas. Four wells have been drilled by Cuadrilla Resources, and one by IGAS Energy. None of the wells have produced gas.\n\nCuadrilla started drilling Britain's first shale gas exploration well, the Preese-Hall-1, in August 2010. The well penetrated 800m of organic-rich shale. The company hydraulically fractured the well in early 2011, but suspended the operation when it triggered two seismic events of magnitudes (M) 2.3 and 1.5, the larger of which was felt by at least 23 people at the surface. Work on the well stopped in May 2011, and the government declared a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing that was sustained until December 2012, subject to additional controls to limit seismic risk.\n\nIn September 2011, Cuadrilla announced a huge discovery of 200 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas in place under the Fylde Coast in Lancashire. Cuadrilla stated that it would be happy if it could recover 10–20% of the gas in place. Lord Browne ignored this latter point in media interviews, claiming that the Lancashire discovery could satisfy the UK's gas consumption \"for 56 years\", with similar, sensational media reports claiming that the find was \"so rich it could meet Britain's needs for decades\", or that it had \"the potential to do more for Lancashire than the cotton industry.\" (For comparison, the cotton industry in Lancashire employed, at peak penetration in 1811, 37% of the county, or about 70,000 people; Cuadrilla believes fracking will create 1,700 jobs in Lancashire, current population 1.1m). The British Geological Survey—responsible for producing inventories of the UK's mineral resources, and far more cautious in its estimates—felt prompted, however, to re-evaluate its projections in light of the find, which Cuadrilla believes could provide 5,600 jobs in the UK at the peak of production. Industry estimates suggest shale gas in Lancashire alone could deliver £6bn of gas a year for the next three decades.\n\nIn July 2013, Cuadrilla applied for a permit to hydraulically fracture its previously drilled well at the Grange Hill site. In April 2014, Cuadrilla published news of their continuing consultation with residents shale gas exploration sites in the Fylde.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, IGas Energy drilled a deep well to evaluate shale gas, and found gas shows in the Bowland Shale, with total organic content averaging 2.7%. The formation was reported to be thermally mature, in the wet gas window. IGAS bought large blocks of gas licences in 2011, much of which is reportedly prospective for shale gas.\n\nIGas announced that it would drill a well to evaluate shale gas at Barton, near Manchester. Drilling would begin in October 2013, and take two to three months. IGas has not applied for a permit to hydraulically fracture the well.\n\nA BGS/DECC report from May 2014 indicates that there is little potential for shale gas fracturing in the Weald Basin, south of London. It does suggest that there is the possibility for the extraction of light tight oil from shales (LTO)\n\nAccording to February 2013 reports from PricewaterhouseCoopers, there could be £80 billion in reserves in Northern Ireland, although these claims were criticised as being sensationalist.\n\nThe Durham Energy Institute has examined the likelihood of drilling in National Parks. The parks with geologies of interest are the North York Moors, the Peak District, the South Downs and to the south of the Yorkshire Dales.\n\nAccording to a 2011 report of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, \"Shale gas resources in the UK could be considerable—particularly offshore—but are unlikely to be a \"game changer\" to the same extent as they have been in the US, where the shale gas revolution has led to a reduction in natural gas prices.\" The Committee's chairperson, Tim Yeo, revised his personal opinion in 2012, however, and argued shale gas is a \"game changer\" that could \"transform the UK's energy independence\". Interest in fracking came just as imports of gas to the UK had surpassed domestic production in 2011 for the first time since the 1960s.\n\nEstimating the size of recoverable resource is difficult due to the uncertainty of the usually small percentage of shale gas that is recoverable. In addition, companies may embrace large estimations of reserves to boost share prices. In the United States, companies had been subpoenaed in 2011 on suspicion that the projections they provided to investors, including press-release figures, were inflated. In 2012, national agencies in the U.S and Poland revised dramatically downward their estimates of shale gas resources.\n\nPart of the problem in evaluation is also the uncertainty of decline curve analysis from early data: shale gas wells can fall off sharply during the first year or two, then level off to a slower decline rate; the shape of the curve, and therefore the ultimate recovery, is difficult to predict from early production rates.\n\nBefore drilling, IGas estimated gas in place of 4.6 Tcf in the Ince Marshes site, though it was unlikely that more than 20% of it could be recoverable; After drilling their first well, IGas announced that the estimated gas in place was at least double their previous estimate.\n\nIn early 2012, Celtique Energie estimated that there might be as much as 14 Tcf of recoverable reserves in countryside south of Horsham, West Sussex. Preliminary estimates in 2011 suggested that there may be £70bn worth of shale gas in South Wales, and 1.5bn bbl oil equivalent in Northern Ireland according to a report by PwC.\n\nIn June 2013, the British Geological Survey estimated the gas in place within the Bowland Shale of central Britain to be within the range of 822 TCF to 2281 TCF, with a central estimate of , but did not estimate how much of the gas was likely to be recoverable, and cautioned:\n\nIndustry estimates were that about 10% of gas in place could be extracted. 130 TCF would supply Britain's gas needs for about 50 years.\n\nComment from the British Geological Survey suggested even more substantial shale gas reserves offshore.\n\nIn June 2013, the US Energy Information Administration issued a worldwide estimate of shale gas, which included an incomplete estimate of recoverable shale gas resources in the UK. The Carboniferous shale basins of North of England and Scotland, which include the Bowland Basin, were estimated to have 25 trillion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas. The Jurassic shales of the Wessex Basin and Weald Basin of southern England were estimated to have 600 billion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas and 700 million barrels of associated oil. The agency noted that the UK shale basins are more complex than those in the US, and therefore more costly to drill. On the other hand, as of June 2013, the price of natural gas in the United Kingdom was reported to be more than double the price in the US and Canada by one source and three times higher by other sources.\n\nIn 2012, a joint report by the Royal Society and Royal Association of Engineers (RS/RAE), commissioned by the government to identify the problems and advise regulatory agencies, emphasised that regulation \"must be fit for purpose\" with a focus on maintaining \"regulatory co-ordination and capacity\" and \"the way in which risks scale up should a future shale gas industry develop nationwide.\" The government responded with a paper that outlined the requirements of the regulatory framework.\n\nIn January 2014, an impact assessment by the European Commission concluded that existing legal and regulatory environments for shale gas exploration and development were insufficient, and recommended a new directive with specific requirements for high volume hydraulic fracturing to address: \"environmental risks and impacts\"; allay \"public concerns\", and; \"enable investments\". In August 2016, the Environment Agency followed up their 2013 draft consultation with their final version on guidance for \"flow testing and well stimulation, including hydraulic fracturing\" for onshore operators in England.\n\nIn 2012, the joint Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering report was critical of current regulation which failed to ensure independence of the well examiner scheme by ensuring that the well examiner was independent of the operating company. The government responded: \"there are a few well operators who wish to use in-house examiners, and that option is legally open to them if they can fulfil the DCR (Design and Construction Regulations) requirements of an appropriate level of impartiality and independence from any aspects of the well design/construction/operation.\"(paraphrase this instead of using quote)\n\nShale gas is largely methane, a hydrocarbon fuel. As such the carbon dioxide it produces contributes to global warming, although less so than coal. Of more concern is leaking or fugitive emissions of unburned methane, which is a greenhouse gas. It has been argued that, in opening a new source of hydrocarbons, it may reduce the incentive and financing of renewable sources of energy.\n\nThe 2008 Climate Change Act committed the UK to reducing CO2 emissions by 50% in 2030, and by 80% by 2050. In 2013, the UK generated 36% of its electricity from coal. According to , replacing coal with shale gas would be one possible solution that provides reliable on demand electricity as it has a greenhouse gas equivalent value of about half that of coal.\n\nA 2011 study based in the United States found that, due to the fugitive emissions of methane, shale gas may produce more greenhouse gas emissions than coal. The study was criticised by other researchers, but the authors argue that their data has since been corroborated by other studies.\n\nA 2013 government-sponsored study of the effect of large-scale natural gas development in Britain concluded that emissions from shale gas could be consistent with meeting climate change targets so long as the emissions were counteracted by similar size reductions elsewhere in the world, although the authors suggest that 'without global climate policies...new fossil fuel exploitation is likely to lead to an increase in cumulative carbon emissions and the risk of climate change'.\n\nIn April 2014, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its 5th Assessment report. With regard to natural gas, and the shale gas debate, it states \"GHG emissions from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing current world average coal‐fired power plants with modern, highly efficient natural gas combined‐cycle power plants or combined heat and power plants, provided that natural gas is available and the fugitive emissions associated with extraction and supply are low or mitigated (robust evidence, high agreement). In mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm CO2eq concentrations by 2100, natural gas power generation without CCS acts as a bridge technology, with deployment increasing before peaking and falling to below current levels by 2050 and declining further in the second half of the century (robust evidence, high agreement)\".\n\nIn November 2014, the UK Energy Research Centre issued a report that stated \"gas could play an important role as a ‘bridging fuel’ to a low-carbon economy, but warns that it won’t be long before gas becomes part of the problem rather than the solution\". It noted that the UK imports more than half its gas, and that \"gas use beginning to fall in the late 2020s and early 2030s, with any major role beyond 2035 requiring the widespread use of carbon capture and storage\" It also states \"Instead of banking on shale, UKERC recommends rapidly expanding investment in alternative low-carbon energy sources and investing in more gas storage, which would help protect consumers against short-term supply disruption and price rises\"\n\nIn 2012, the jointly published Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering Shale Gas Review included recommendations on groundwater contamination, well integrity, seismic risk, gas leakage, water usage and disposal, management of environmental risk, implementation of best practice, with well integrity being \"of key importance\".\n\nThere are concerns, originating in the USA that drilling could lead to pollution from hydrocarbon based chemicals. Regulations in the UK call for total fluid and gas security meaning that in routine operations, no unburnt gases would be emitted. Venting of unburnt gas is only permitted for safety reasons or in an emergency.\n\nThe British Geological Survey, in reviewing the US experience with hydraulic fracturing of shale formations, observed: \"where the problems are genuinely attributable to shale gas operations, the problem is with poor well design and construction, rather than anything distinctive to shale gas.\"\n\nContamination of groundwater by methane can occur after the abandonment of the well: \"Gas and other contaminants may accumulate slowly in these cracks, enter shallow strata or even leak at the surface many years after production or well abandonment. Even the presence of surface casing provides no assurance against gas leakage at the surface from the surrounding ground.\"\n\nDirectional drilling allows a large hydrocarbon reservoir to be accessed using a single well pad, such as in Europe's biggest onshore oilfield, Wytch Farm. Likely well spacing visualised by the December 2013 DECC Strategic Environmental Assessment report indicated that well pad spacings of 5 km were likely in crowded areas, with up to 3 hectares per well pad. Each pad could have 24 separate wells. This amounts to 0.16% of land area.\n\nIn 2016, the Chartered Institute for Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) stated that shale gas fields will potentially be \"more extensive\" than conventional onshore fields, using around 3.6 ha per shale gas well pad compared to 1.9 ha for conventional well pads, and that after \"completion or abandonment\" of a shale gas well pad, \"it may not be possible to fully restore sites\" \"in areas of high agricultural, natural or cultural value\".\n\nAccording to Professor Mair, who chaired the joint review by the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering, \"well integrity is of key importance\".\n\nIn the first UK shale gas well, Preese Hall 1, the cement bond log (CBL) showed some places with poor cement behind the casing in the lowest 100 feet of the well, between zones in the production hole section, which were repaired to achieve better zone isolation. Without repair, production would have been compromised, but not the integrity of the well.\n\nThe magnitude 2.3M coseismic slip of 1 April 2011 caused casing deformation in \"the lower section of the reservoir productive zone\" of the Preese Hall 1 well. Well \"integrity was not considered a risk\" \"due to the \"integrity of the casing, and the cement, in the upper completion\", \"confirmed by surface gas measurements and annular pressure readings\".\n\nIt is commonly believed that '6% of wells leak immediately, 50% of wells leak after some time and all wells will leak eventually'. This is not an issue specific to shale gas exploration and production, it is a concern with every well that is drilled. This originates from a document that sells solutions for this problem to oil and gas companies. This often relates to 'SCP', or Sustained Casing Pressure This is a 'well barrier' issue, but could also include casing 'integrity' (external) leaks. Regulation calls for baseline monitoring to determine if any leak issues are related to the drilled well.\nIf a well were to leak, workover operations can usually fix leaks, by, for instance, perforating the casing above and below a poorly cemented zone, and 'squeezing' cement behind the pipe. The cement is drilled out and a pressure test is performed until pressure integrity is good.\nIn 2013, data from DECC was released concerning offshore and onshore well leaks from operating and abandoned wells and of the approx 2000 onshore wells, and approx 6500 offshore wells, the number of reported leaks between and 2008 and 2013 was zero,\n"}
{"id": "195193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=195193", "title": "Sky", "text": "Sky\n\nThe sky (or celestial dome) is everything that lies above the surface of the Earth, including the atmosphere and outer space.\n\nIn the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the celestial sphere. This is viewed from Earth's surface as an abstract dome on which the Sun, stars, planets, and Moon appear to be traveling. The celestial sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called constellations. Usually, the term \"sky\" is used informally as the point of view from the Earth's surface; however, the meaning and usage can vary. In some cases, such as in discussing the weather, the sky refers to only the lower, more dense portions of the atmosphere.\n\nDuring daylight, the sky appears to be blue because air scatters more blue sunlight than red. At night, the sky appears to be a mostly dark surface or region spangled with stars. During the day, the Sun can be seen in the sky unless obscured by clouds. In the night sky (and to some extent during the day) the Moon, planets and stars are visible in the sky. Some of the natural phenomena seen in the sky are clouds, rainbows, and aurorae. Lightning and precipitation can also be seen in the sky during storms. Birds, insects, aircraft, and kites are often considered to fly in the sky. Due to human activities, smog during the day and light pollution during the night are often seen above large cities.\n\nExcept for light that comes directly from the sun, most of the light in the day sky is caused by scattering, which is dominated by a small-particle limit called Rayleigh Scattering. The scattering due to molecule sized particles (as in air) is greater in the forward and backward directions than it is in the lateral direction. Scattering is significant for light at all visible wavelengths but is stronger at the shorter (bluer) end of the visible spectrum, meaning that the scattered light is bluer than its source, the sun. The remaining sunlight, having lost some of its short wavelength components, appears slightly less blue.\n\nScattering also occurs even more strongly in clouds. Individual water droplets exposed to white light will create a set of colored rings. If a cloud is thick enough, scattering from multiple water droplets will wash out the set of colored rings and create a washed-out white color.\n\nThe sky can turn a multitude of colors such as red, orange, purple and yellow (especially near sunset or sunrise) when the light must pass through a much longer path (or optical depth) through the atmosphere. Scattering effects also partially polarize light from the sky and are most pronounced at an angle 90° from the sun. Scattered light from the horizon travels through as much as 38 times the atmosphere as does light from the zenith, causing a blue gradient: vivid at the zenith, and pale near the horizon. Because red light also scatters if there is enough air between the source and the observer causing parts of the sky to change color during a sunset. As the amount of atmosphere nears infinity, the scattered light appears whiter and whiter.\n\nThe sun is not the only object that may appear less blue in the atmosphere. Far away clouds or snowy mountaintops may appear yellowish. The effect is not very obvious on clear days but is very pronounced when clouds cover the line of sight, reducing the blue hue from scattered sunlight. At higher altitudes, the sky tends toward darker colors since scattering is reduced due to lower air density; an extreme example is the moon, where there is no atmosphere and no scattering, making the sky on the moon black even when the sun is visible.\n\nSky luminance distribution models have been recommended by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) for the design of daylighting schemes. Recent developments relate to “all sky models” for modelling sky luminance under weather conditions ranging from clear to overcast.\n\nThe intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day, and the primary cause of that intensity differs as well. When the sun is well above the horizon, direct scattering of sunlight (Rayleigh scattering) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. However, in twilight, the period of time between sunset and night and between night and sunrise, the situation is more complicated. Green flashes and green rays are optical phenomena that occur shortly after sunset or before sunrise, when a green spot is visible above the sun, usually for no more than a second or two, or it may resemble a green ray shooting up from the sunset point. Green flashes are a group of phenomena that stem from different causes, most of which occur when there is a temperature inversion (when the temperature increases with altitude rather than the normal decrease in temperature with altitude). Green flashes may be observed from any altitude (even from an aircraft). They are usually seen at an unobstructed horizon, such as over the ocean, but are also seen over cloud tops and mountain tops. Green flashes may also be observed at the horizon in association with the Moon and bright planets, including Venus and Jupiter.\n\nThe Earth's shadow is the shadow that the Earth casts on its atmosphere. This atmospheric phenomenon is sometimes seen twice a day, around the times of sunset and sunrise. When the weather conditions and the observer's viewing point permit a clear sight of the horizon, the shadow can be seen as a dark blue or greyish-blue band. Assuming the sky is clear, the Earth's shadow is visible in the half of the sky opposite to the sunset or sunrise, and is seen as a dark blue band right above the horizon. A related phenomenon is the \"Belt of Venus\" or \"anti-twilight arch\", a pink band that is visible above the dark blue band of the Earth's shadow in the same part of the sky. There is no clear dividing line between the Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus: one colored band shades into the other in the sky.\n\nTwilight is divided into three segments according to how far the sun is below the horizon, measured in segments of 6°. After sunset the civil twilight sets in; it ends when the sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the nautical twilight, when the sun is 6° and 12° below the horizon (heights of between −6° and −12°), after which comes the astronomical twilight, defined as the period from −12° to −18°. When the sun drops more than 18° below the horizon, the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.\n\nSeveral sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely airglow, indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial light pollution.\n\nThe term night sky refers to the sky as seen at night. The term is usually associated with skygazing and astronomy, with reference to views of celestial bodies such as stars, the Moon, and planets that become visible on a clear night after the Sun has set. Natural light sources in a night sky include moonlight, starlight, and airglow, depending on location and timing. The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night can be easily observed. Were the sky (in the absence of moon and city lights) absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.\n\nThe night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. In the past, for instance, farmers have used the state of the night sky as a calendar to determine when to plant crops. The ancient belief in astrology is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on Earth. The \"scientific\" study of the night sky and bodies observed within it, meanwhile, takes place in the science of astronomy.\n\nWithin visible-light astronomy, the visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by light pollution. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of ambient lighting. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. Special filters and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for the best views, both professional and amateur optical astronomers seek viewing sites located far from major urban areas.\n\nAlong with pressure tendency, the condition of the sky is one of the more important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicate the approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions and can be associated with a marine layer, an indication of a stable atmosphere. Rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds which prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.\n\nWithin 36 hours of the passage of a tropical cyclone's center, the pressure begins to fall and a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches from the cyclone's direction. Within 24 hours of the closest approach to the center, low clouds begin to move in, also known as the bar of a tropical cyclone, as the barometric pressure begins to fall more rapidly and the winds begin to increase. Within 18 hours of the center's approach, squally weather is common, with sudden increases in wind accompanied by rain showers or thunderstorms. Within six hours of the center's arrival, rain becomes continuous. Within an hour of the center, the rain becomes very heavy and the highest winds within the tropical cyclone are experienced. When the center arrives with a strong tropical cyclone, weather conditions improve and the sun becomes visible as the eye moves overhead. Once the system departs, winds reverse and, along with the rain, suddenly increase. One day after the center's passage, the low overcast is replaced with a higher overcast, and the rain becomes intermittent. By 36 hours after the center's passage, the high overcast breaks and the pressure begins to level off.\n\nFlight is the process by which an object moves, through or beyond the sky (as in the case of spaceflight), by generating aerodynamic lift, propulsive thrust, aerostatically using buoyancy, or by ballistic movement, without any direct mechanical support from the ground. The engineering aspects of flight are studied in aerospace engineering which is subdivided into aeronautics, which is the study of vehicles that travel through the air, and astronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through space, and in ballistics, the study of the flight of projectiles. While human beings have been capable of flight via hot air balloons since 1783, other species have used flight for significantly longer. Animals, such as birds, bats, and insects are capable of flight. Spores and seeds from plants use flight, via use of the wind, as a method of propagating their species.\n\nMany mythologies have deities especially associated with the sky. In Egyptian religion, the sky was deified as the goddess Nut and as the god Horus. Dyeus is reconstructed as the god of the sky, or the sky personified, in Proto-Indo-European religion, whence Zeus, the god of the sky and thunder in Greek mythology and the Roman god of sky and thunder Jupiter.\n\nIn Australian Aboriginal mythology, Altjira (or Arrernte) is the main sky god and also the creator god. In Iroquois mythology, Atahensic was a sky goddess who fell down to the ground during the creation of the Earth. Many cultures have drawn constellations between stars in the sky, using them in association with legends and mythology about their deities.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6538731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6538731", "title": "Twomey effect", "text": "Twomey effect\n\nThe Twomey effect describes how additional cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), possibly from anthropogenic pollution, may increase the amount of solar radiation reflected by clouds. This is an indirect effect (or radiative forcing) by such particles, as distinguished from direct effects (forcing) due to enhanced scattering or absorbing radiation by such particles not in clouds.\n\nCloud droplets normally form on aerosol particles that serve as CCN. Increasing the number concentration of CCN can lead to formation of more cloud droplets, which, in turn, have smaller size. The increase in number concentration increases the optical depth of the cloud, which results in increase in the cloud albedo making clouds appear whiter. Satellite imagery often shows trails of cloud or of enhanced brightness of cloud behind ocean-going ships due to this effect. The decrease in global mean absorption of solar radiation due to increases in CCN concentrations exerts a cooling influence on climate; the global average magnitude of this effect over the industrial era is estimated as between -0.3 and -1.8 Wm. \n\nAssume a uniform cloud that extends infinitely in the horizontal plane, also assume that the particle size distribution peaks near an average value of formula_1.\n\nThe formula for the optical depth of a cloud:\n\nformula_2\n\nWhere formula_3 is the optical depth, formula_4 is cloud thickness, formula_1 is the average particle size, and formula_6 is the total particle density.\n\nThe formula for the liquid water content of a cloud is:\n\nformula_7\n\nWhere formula_8is the density of water.\n\nTaking our assumptions into account we can combine the two to derive this expression:\n\nformula_9\n\nIf we assume liquid water content (formula_10) is equal for the cloud before and after altering the particle density we obtain:\n\nformula_11\n\nNow we assume total particle density formula_6 is increased by a factor of 2 and we can solve for how formula_13 changes when formula_6 is doubled.\n\nformula_15= formula_16\n\nWe can now take our equation that relates formula_3 to formula_10 to solve for the change in optical depth when the particle size is reduced.\n\nformula_19\n\nIn more general terms, the Twomey effect states that for a fixed liquid water content formula_10 and cloud depth, the optical thickness can be represented by:\n\nformula_21\n\nThis brings us to the conclusion that increasing the total particle density also increases the optical depth, illustrating the Twomey Effect mathematically.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1707531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1707531", "title": "Vegetable Lamb of Tartary", "text": "Vegetable Lamb of Tartary\n\nThe Vegetable Lamb of Tartary (Latin: \"Agnus scythicus\" or \"Planta Tartarica Barometz\") is a legendary zoophyte of Central Asia, once believed to grow sheep as its fruit. It was believed the sheep were connected to the plant by an umbilical cord and grazed the land around the plant. When all accessible foliage was gone, both the plant and sheep died.\n\nUnderlying the legend is the cotton plant, which was unknown in Northern Europe before the Norman conquest of Sicily.\n\nThomas Browne's \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\" named it as the \"Boramez\".\n\nIn Ephraim Chambers' \"Cyclopædia\", Agnus scythicus was described as a kind of zoophyte, said to grow in Tartary, resembling the figure and structure of a lamb. It was also called \"Agnus Vegetabilis\", \"Agnus Tartaricus\" and bore the reported endonyms of \"Borometz\", \"Borametz\" and \"Boranetz\". \n\nIn his book, \"The Vegetable Lamb of Tartary\" (1887), Henry Lee describes the legendary lamb as believed to be both a true animal and a living plant. However, he states that some writers believed the lamb to be the fruit of a plant, sprouting forward from melon-like seeds. Others, however, believed the lamb to be a living member of the plant that, once separated from it, would perish. The vegetable lamb was believed to have blood, bones, and flesh like that of a normal lamb. It was connected to the earth by a stem, similar to an umbilical cord, that propped the lamb up above ground. The cord could flex downward, allowing the lamb to feed on the grass and plants surrounding it. Once the plants within reach were eaten, the lamb died. It could be eaten, once dead, and its blood supposedly tasted sweet like honey. Its wool was said to be used by the native people of its homeland to make head coverings and other articles of clothing. The only carnivorous animals attracted to the lamb-plant (other than humans) were wolves.\n\nThe Greek historian Herodotus wrote of trees in India \"the fruit whereof is a wool exceeding in beauty and goodness that of sheep. The natives make their clothes of this tree-wool.\"\n\nThere is mention of a similar plant-animal in Jewish folklore as early as AD 436. This creature, called the Yeduah (, , or ), was like a lamb in form and sprouted from the earth connected to a stem. Those who went hunting the Yeduah could only harvest the creature by severing it from its stem with arrows or darts. Once the animal was severed, it died and its bones could be used in divination and prophetic ceremonies.\n\nAn alternative version of the legend tells of the \"jeduah\", a human-shaped plant-animal connected to the earth from a stem attached to its navel. The jeduah was believed to be aggressive, though, grabbing and killing any creature that wandered too close. Like the Barometz, it too died once severed from its stem.\n\nThe Minorite Friar Odoric of Pordenone, upon recalling first hearing of the vegetable lamb, told of trees on the shore of the Irish Sea with gourd-like fruits that fell into the water and became birds called Bernacles. He is referring to the legendary plant-animal, the barnacle tree, which was believed to drop its ripened fruit into the sea near the Orkney Islands. The ripened fruit would then release \"barnacle geese\" that would live in the water, growing to mature geese. The alleged existence of this fellow plant-animal was accepted as an explanation for migrating geese from the North.\n\nIn his work \"The Shui-yang or Watersheep and The Agnus Scythicus or Vegetable Lamb\" (1892), Gustav Schlegel points to Chinese legends of the \"watersheep\" as inspiration for the legend of the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary. Much like the vegetable lamb, the watersheep was believed to be both plant and animal and tales of its existence placed it near Persia. It was connected to the ground by a stem and, if the stem were severed, it would die. The animal was protected from aggressors by an enclosure built around it and by armored men yelling and beating drums. Its wool was also said to be used for fine clothing and headdresses. (In turn, the origin of watersheep is an explanation for sea silk.)\n\nEarlier versions of the legend tell of the lamb as a fruit, springing from a melon or gourd-like seed, perfectly formed as if born naturally. As time passed, this idea was replaced with the notion that the creature was indeed both a living animal and a living plant. Gustav Schlegel, in his work on the various legends of the vegetable lamb, recounts the lamb being born without its horns, but with two puffs of white, curly hair instead.\n\nThe 14th century book, \"The Travels of Sir John Mandeville\" is credited with bringing the legend to public attention in Europe. It describes a strange gourd-like fruit grown in Tartary. Once ripe, the fruit was cut open, revealing what looked like a lamb in flesh and blood but lacking wool. The fruit and the lamb could then be eaten.\n\nFriar Odoric of Friuli, much like Mandeville, travelled extensively and claimed to have heard of gourds in Persia that when ripe, opened to contain lamb-like beasts.\n\nIn the mid-16th century, Sigismund, Baron von Herberstein, who in 1517 and 1526 was the Ambassador to the Emperors Maximilian I and Charles V, presented a much more detailed account of the Barometz in his \"Notes on Russia.\" He claimed to have heard from too many credible sources to doubt the lamb’s existence and gave the location of the creature as being near the Caspian Sea, between the Jaick and Volga rivers. The creature grown from the melon-like seeds described was said to grow to two and half feet high (80 cm), resembling a lamb in most ways except a few. It was said to have blood, but not true flesh as it more closely resembled that of a crab. Unlike a normal lamb, its hooves were said to be made of parted hair. It was the favourite food of wolves and other animals.\n\nIn 1600 Sir Hans Sloane claimed a Chinese tree fern, \"Cibotium barometz\", was the origin of the myth. Sloane found the specimen in a Chinese cabinet of curiosities he acquired. The \"lamb\" is produced by removing the leaves from a short length of the fern's woolly rhizome. When the rhizome is inverted, it fancifully resembles a woolly lamb with the legs being formed by the severed petiole bases.\n\nThe German scholar and physician Engelbert Kaempfer accompanied an embassy to Persia in 1683 with the intention of locating the lamb. After speaking with native inhabitants and finding no physical evidence of the lamb-plant, Kaempfer concluded it to be nothing but legend. However, he observed the custom of removing an unborn lamb from its mother’s womb in order to harvest the soft wool and believed the practice to be a possible source of the legend. He speculated further that museum specimens of the fetal wool could be mistaken for a vegetable substance.\n\nIn Dr. Erasmus Darwin’s work \"The Botanic Garden\" (1781), he writes of the Borametz:\n<poem>\nE'en round the Pole the flames of love aspire,\nAnd icy bosoms feel the secret fire,\nCradled in snow, and fanned by Arctic air,\nShines, gentle borametz, thy golden hair\nRooted in earth, each cloven foot descends,\nAnd round and round her flexile neck she bends,\nCrops the grey coral moss, and hoary thyme,\nOr laps with rosy tongue the melting rime;\nEyes with mute tenderness her distant dam,\nAnd seems to bleat – a vegetable lamb</poem>\nGuillaume de Salluste Du Bartas writes of the vegetable lamb in his poem \"La Semaine\" (1587). In the poem, Adam wanders the Garden of Eden and is amazed by the peculiarity of the creature. Joshua Sylvester translates:\n\n<poem>\nBut with true beasts, fast in the ground still sticking\nFeeding on grass, and th' airy moisture licking,\nSuch as those Borametz in Scythia bred\nOf slender seeds, and with green fodder fed;\nAlthough their bodies, noses, mouths, and eyes,\nOf new-yeaned lambs have full the form and guise,\nAnd should be very lambs, save that for foot\nWithin the ground they fix a living root\nWhich at their navel grows, and dies that day\nThat they have browzed the neighboring grass away.\nOh! Wondrous nature of God only good,\nThe beast hath root, the plant hath flesh and blood.\nThe nimble plant can turn it to and fro,\nThe nummed beast can neither stir nor goe,\nThe plant is leafless, branchless, void of fruit,\nThe beast is lustless, sexless, fireless, mute:\nThe plant with plants his hungry paunch doth feede,\nTh' admired beast is sowen a slender seed.</poem>\nIn his work \"Connubia Florum, Latino Carmine Demonstrata\" (1791), Dr. De la Croix writes of the vegetable lamb (translated):\n\n<poem>\nFor in his path he sees a monstrous birth,\nThe Borametz arises from the earth\nUpon a stalk is fixed a living brute,\nA rooted plant bears quadruped for fruit,\n…It is an animal that sleeps by day\nAnd wakes at night, though rooted in the ground,\nTo feed on grass within its reach around.</poem>\n\n\n\n\n"}
