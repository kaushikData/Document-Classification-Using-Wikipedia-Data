It can persist for millennia in between eruptions and each uplift event is normally accompanied by thousands of small to moderate earthquakes. The word derives from the ancient Greek words \"bradus\", meaning 'slow', and \"seism\" meaning 'movement', and was coined by Arturo Issel in 1883.\n\nThe area of Phlegraean Fields (Campi Flegrei), near Naples, is a collapsed caldera, namely a volcanic area formed by several volcanic edifices, which includes the Solfatara volcano, well known for its spectacular fumaroles. Campi Flegrei area is especially noted for bradyseismic uplift and subsidence. The inflation and deflation of this caldera is especially well documented due to its seaside location and a long history of habitation and construction in the area.\n\nIn particular, the town of Pozzuoli features the Roman Macellum of Pozzuoli in which three marble columns show bands of boreholes or \"Gastrochaenolites\" left by marine \"Lithophaga\" molluscs. These occur up to 7 metres up the columns, showing how bradyseism in the area lowered the land to at least this depth under the sea and subsequently raised it again.\n\nMore recently, between 1968 and 1972, the Campi Flegrei area suffered an episode of positive bradyseism and rose by 1.7 metres. Another rise of 1.8 metres occurred between 1982 and 1984. This correlated with a shallow (4 km deep) earthquake swarm during the same period, which led to the evacuation of 30,000 people due to the perceived risk of imminent eruption.\n"}

It is the deepest point in the Caribbean Sea and forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. It extends from the Windward Passage, going south of the Sierra Maestra of Cuba toward Guatemala. The transform continues onshore as the Motagua Fault, which cuts across Guatemala and extends offshore under the Pacific Ocean, where it intersects the Middle America Trench subduction zone.\n\nThe relatively narrow trough trends east-northeast to west-southwest and has a maximum depth of .

Major seeps are located in water depths from 20 to 80 meters. The seep field is among the largest and best studied areas of active marine seepage in the world. These perennial and continuous oil and gas seeps have been active on the northern edge of the Santa Barbara Channel for at least 500,000 years. The combined seeps in the field release about 40 tons of methane per day and about 19 tons of reactive organic gas (ethane, propane, butane and higher hydrocarbons); about twice the hydrocarbon air pollution released by all the cars and trucks in Santa Barbara County in 1990. The liquid petroleum produces a slick that is many kilometres long and when degraded by evaporation and weathering, produces tar balls which wash up on the beaches for miles around.\n\nThis seep also releases on the order of of liquid petroleum per day. The field produces about 9 cubic meters of natural gas per barrel of petroleum.\n\nLeakage from the natural seeps near Platform Holly, the production platform for the South Ellwood Offshore oilfield, has decreased substantially, probably from the decrease in reservoir pressure due to the oil and gas produced at the platform.\n\nWritten records, dating from as early as 1792, describe effects of offshore seeps in the Santa Barbara Channel. Oil and tar \"slicks\" have long been a trademark of the area. In 1792, Captain Cook's navigator George Vancouver recorded on passing through the channel:\nIt had been commonly assumed that the local Chumash Native Americans used COP seep oil washed up on the beaches to seal their plank canoes and baskets. However, archaeologists assert that the mainland Chumash in fact used asphalt from nearby onshore seeps in beach cliffs. These seeps must be sourced from a similar subsurface reservoir system, but exposure to oxidation is required to make the material hard and useful.\n\nThe location of the COP seep field offshore from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) has situated it as a natural laboratory for study of the phenomena of oil and gas introduced into the ocean from the sea bed, along with the role of geologic methane from seeps worldwide in the global methane budget. Since the 1990s almost a dozen UCSB researchers along with their graduate students have studied the geology, chemistry, oceanography and ecology of the marine seep system at COP. Many of these studies were in partnership with oil companies including Mobil and Venoco, which produced oil from reservoirs below the seeps, and the U.S. Geological Survey and California State Lands Commission.\n\nThe marine hydrocarbon seep system comprises a seabed source (vent) of oil and gas bubbles coated with oil, that transit the shallow water column while partially dissolving into the ocean. At the surface, various gases are discharged to the atmosphere and the oil volatilizes as it is transported by currents, leaving a tarry residue at the sea surface.\n\nAt the sea surface the seeps are marked by oil slicks, and in places, bubble froth. Since the 1970s and later, oil slicks from COP and others in the Santa Barbara Channel have been successfully mapped by remote sensing. Because the COP seeps are characterized by large visible gas bubble plumes they can be detected and mapped by sonar backscatter. The first attempts at this were made by Peter Fischer and colleagues of California State University, Northridge in the early 1970s. They produced reconnaissance level maps of bubble plumes at COP and at other locations in the Santa Barbara Channel. They noted that because the COP seeps were associated with a producing oil platform then operated by ARCO, continued oil production might result in a decrease in volume of seep discharge.\n\nScott Hornafius and Bruce Luyendyk, along with graduate student Derek Quigley made sonar surveys of the COP field two decades later using 50 kHz sonar and 3.5 kHz sonar equipment that matched that used by Fischer and colleagues. They calibrated the sonar data with seafloor artificial sources to estimate the volume of gas discharge cited above. Using an estimate of the gas/oil ratio along with capture of oil with a floating boom, they also estimated the volume of oil discharge (above). Comparing the surveys made in the mid 1990s with the early 1970s data of Fischer and colleagues they determined that seepage near the producing platform Holly had decreased by half. This observation was supported by gas capture data recorded by two sea floor tent structures that covered one large seepage area.\n\nSurveys continued over the 1990s and 2000s using more sophisticated sonars including chirp and multibeam sonars. These repeat sonar surveys did not detect further decrease in seepage, while during the same period oil production continued.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "191282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191282", "title": "Coandă effect", "text": "Coandă effect\n\nThe Coandă effect ( or ) is the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to a convex surface. As described by the eponymous Henri Coandă in different patents: \"the tendency of a jet of fluid emerging from an orifice to follow an adjacent flat or curved surface and to entrain fluid from the surroundings so that a region of lower pressure develops.\" The pressure effect, which is usually not indicated, is fundamental for the comprehension of the Coandă effect.\n\nThe principle was named after Romanian aerodynamics pioneer Henri Coandă, who was the first to recognize the practical application of the phenomenon in aircraft development.\n\nAn early description of this phenomenon was provided by Thomas Young in a lecture given to The Royal Society in 1800:\nThe lateral pressure which urges the flame of a candle towards the stream of air from a blowpipe is probably exactly similar to that pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle. Mark the dimple which a slender stream of air makes on the surface of water. Bring a convex body into contact with the side of the stream and the place of the dimple will immediately\nshow the current is deflected towards the body; and if the body be at liberty to move in every direction it will be urged towards the current...\nA hundred years later, Henri Coandă identified an application of the effect during experiments with his Coandă-1910 aircraft, which mounted an unusual engine he designed. The motor-driven turbine pushed hot air rearward, and Coandă noticed that the airflow was attracted to nearby surfaces. In 1934 Coandă obtained a patent in France for a \"method and apparatus for deviation of a fluid into another fluid.\" The effect was described as the \"deviation of a plain jet of a fluid that penetrates another fluid in the vicinity of a convex wall.\" The first official documents that explicitly mention the Coandă effect were two 1936 patents by Henri Coandă. This name was accepted by the leading aerodynamicist Theodore von Kármán, who had with Coandă a long scientific relationship on aerodynamics problems.\n\nA jet of air will entrain molecules of air from its immediate surroundings, causing a \"tube,\" or \"sleeve,\" of low pressure around the jet (see image 1 in the diagram on the left). Ambient air from around this tube of low pressure will exert a force on the jet, which, when seen in cross section, is equal in all directions. The jet will therefore not deviate from moving in a straight line. However, if a solid surface is placed close, and approximately parallel, to the jet (see image 2 in the diagram on the left), the entrainment (and therefore removal) of air from between the solid surface and the jet causes a reduction in air pressure on that side of the jet that cannot be neutralized as rapidly as the low pressure region on the \"open\" side of the jet. The pressure difference across the jet causes the jet to deviate towards the nearby surface, and then to adhere to it (image 3 on the left). The jet will then adhere to the surface even if it is curved (image 4 on the left), because each (infinitesimally small) incremental change in direction of the surface will bring about the effects described for the initial bending of the jet towards the surface. If the surface is not too sharply curved, the jet can, under the right circumstances, adhere to the surface even after flowing 180° round a cylindrically curved surface, and therefore be traveling in a direction opposite to its initial direction. The forces that cause these changes in the direction of flow of the jet cause an equal and opposite force on the surface along which the jet flows. These Coandă effect induced forces can be harnessed to cause lift and other forms of motion, depending on the orientation of the jet and the surface to which the jet adheres.\n\nA small \"lip\" on the surface at the point where the jet starts to flow over that surface (see image 5 in the diagram on the left), enhances the initial deviation of the direction of flow of the jet, and its subsequent adherence to the surface. This results from the fact that a low pressure vortex forms behind the lip, promoting the dip of the jet towards the surface.\n\nThe Coandă effect can be induced in any fluid, and is therefore equally effective in water as in air.\n\nEarly sources provide information, both theoretical and experimental, needed to derive by comparison a detailed explanation of the Coandă effect and its limits. Coandă effect may occur along a curved wall either in a \"free jet\" or a \"wall jet\".\n\nOn the left image of the preceding section: \"The mechanism of Coanda effect\", the effect as described, in the terms of T. Young as \"the lateral pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle\", represents a \"free jet\" emerging from an orifice and an obstacle in the surroundings. It includes the tendency of a free jet emerging from an orifice to entrain fluid from the surroundings confined with limited access, without developing any region of lower pressure when there is no obstacle in the surroundings, as is the case on the opposite side where turbulent mixing occurs at ambient pressure.\n\nOn the right image, the effect occurs along the curved wall as a \"wall jet\". The image here on the right represents a \"two dimensional wall jet\" between two parallel plane walls, where the \"obstacle\" is a quarter cylindrical portion following the flat horizontal rectangular orifice, so that no fluid at all is entrained from the surroundings along the wall, but only on the opposite side in turbulent mixing with ambient air.\n\n1. Wall jet. To compare experiment with a theoretical model, we first refer to a two-dimensional plane wall jet of width \"h\" along a circular wall of radius \"r\". A wall jet follows a flat horizontal wall, say of infinite radius,or rather whose radius is the radius of the Earth \"without separation\" because the surface pressure as well as the external pressure in the mixing zone is everywhere equal to the atmospheric pressure and the boundary layer does not separate from the wall.\n\nWith a much smaller radius (12 centimeters in the image on the right) a transverse difference arises between external and wall surface pressures of the jet, creating a pressure gradient depending upon \"h/r\", the relative curvature. This pressure gradient can appear in a zone before and after the origin of the jet where it gradually arises, and disappear at the point where the jet boundary layer separates from the wall, where the wall pressure reaches atmospheric pressure (and the transverse gradient becomes zero).\n\nExperiments made in 1956 with turbulent air jets at a Reynolds number of 10 at various jet widths () show the pressures measured along a circularly curved wall (radius ) at a series of horizontal distance from the origin of the jet (see the diagram on the right).\n\nAbove a critical ratio of 0.5 only local effects at the origin of the jet are seen extending over a small angle of 18° along the curved wall. The jet then immediately separates from the curved wall. A Coandă effect is therefore not seen here but only a local attachment: a pressure smaller than atmospheric pressure appears on the wall along a distance corresponding to a small angle of 9°, followed by an equal angle of 9° where this pressure increases up to atmospheric pressure at the separation of the boundary layer, subject to this positive longitudinal gradient. However, if the ratio is smaller than the critical value of 0.5, the lower than ambient pressure measured on the wall seen at the origin of the jet continues along the wall (until the wall ends — see diagram on the right). This is \"a true Coandă effect\" as the jet clings to the wall \"at a nearly constant pressure\" as in a conventional wall jet.\n\nA calculation made by Woods in 1954 of an inviscid flow along a circular wall shows that an inviscid solution exists with any curvature and any given deflection angle up to a separation point on the wall, where a singular point appears with an infinite slope of the surface pressure curve. \nIntroducing in the calculation the angle at separation found in the preceding experiments for each value of the relative curvature , the image here was recently obtained, and shows inertial effects represented by the inviscid solution: the calculated pressure field is similar to the experimental one described above, outside the nozzle. The flow curvature is caused exclusively by the transverse pressure gradient, as described by T. Young. Then, viscosity only produces a boundary layer along the wall and turbulent mixing with ambient air as in a conventional wall jet—except that this boundary layer separates under the action of the difference between the finally ambient pressure and a smaller surface pressure along the wall. According to Van Dyke, quoted in Lift (force) Wikipedia article, §10.3, the derivation of his equation (4c) also shows that the contribution of viscous stress to flow turning is negligible.\n\nAn alternative way would be to calculate the deflection angle at which the boundary layer subjected to the inviscid pressure field separates. A rough calculation has been tried that gives the separation angle as a function of and the Reynolds number: The results are reported on the image, e.g., 54° calculated instead of 60° measured for . More experiments and a more accurate boundary layer calculation would be desirable.\n\nOther experiments made in 2004 with a wall jet along a circular wall show that Coandă effect does not occur in a laminar flow, and the critical h/r ratios for small Reynolds numbers are much smaller than those for turbulent flow. down to if and if .\n\n2. Free jet. L. C. Woods also made the calculation of the inviscid two-dimensional flow of a free jet of width h, deflected round a circularly cylindrical surface of radius r, between a first contact A and separation at B, including a deflection angle θ. Again a solution exists for any value of the relative curvature and angle θ. \nMoreover in the case of a free jet the equation can be solved in closed form, giving the distribution of velocity along the circular wall. The surface pressure distribution is then calculated using Bernoulli equation. Let us note the pressure and the velocity along the free streamline at the ambient pressure, and γ the angle along the wall which is zero in A and θ in B. Then the velocity is found to be:\n\nAn image of the surface pressure distribution of the jet round the cylindrical surface using the same values of the relative curvature h/r, and the same angle θ as those found for the wall jet reported in the image on the right side here has been established: it may be found in reference (15) p. 104 and both images are quite similar : Coanda effect of a free jet is inertial, the same as Coanda effect of a wall jet. However, an experimental measurement of the corresponding surface pressure distribution is not known.\n\nExperiments in 1959 by Bourque and Newmann concerning the reattachment of a two-dimensional turbulent jet to an offset parallel plate after enclosing a separation bubble where a low pressure vortex is confined (as in the image 5 in the preceding section) and also for a two-dimensional jet followed by a single flat plate inclined at an angle instead of the circularly curved wall in the diagram on the right here describing the experience of a wall jet: the jet separates from the plate, then curves towards the plate when the surrounding fluid is entrained and pressure lowered, and eventually reattaches to it, enclosing a separation bubble. The jet remains free if the angle is greater than 62°.\n\nIn this last case which is the geometry proposed by Coanda, the claim of the inventor is that the quantity of fluid entrained by the jet from the surroundings is increased when the jet is deflected, a feature exploited to improve the scavenging of internal combustion engines, and to increase the maximum lift coefficient of a wing, as indicated in the applications below.\n\nThe surface pressure distribution as well as the reattachment distance have been duly measured in both cases, and two approximate theories have been developed for the mean pressure within the separation bubble, the position of reattachment and the increase in volume flow from the orifice: the agreement with experiment was satisfactory.\n\nThe Coandă effect has important applications in various high-lift devices on aircraft, where air moving over the wing can be \"bent down\" towards the ground using flaps and a jet sheet blowing over the curved surface of the top of the wing. The bending of the flow results in aerodynamic lift. The flow from a high speed jet engine mounted in a pod over the wing produces increased lift by dramatically increasing the velocity gradient in the shear flow in the boundary layer. In this velocity gradient, particles are blown away from the surface, thus lowering the pressure there. Closely following the work of Coandă on applications of his research, and in particular the work on his \"Aerodina Lenticulară,\"\nJohn Frost of Avro Canada also spent considerable time researching the effect, leading to a series of \"inside out\" hovercraft-like aircraft from which the air exited in a ring around the outside of the aircraft and was directed by being \"attached\" to a flap-like ring.\n\nThis is as opposed to a traditional hovercraft design, in which the air is blown into a central area, the \"plenum\", and directed down with the use of a fabric \"skirt.\" Only one of Frost's designs was ever built, the Avrocar.\n\nThe VZ-9 AV Avrocar (often listed as VZ-9) was a Canadian vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft developed by Avro Aircraft Ltd. as part of a secret United States military project carried out in the early years of the Cold War. The Avrocar intended to exploit the Coandă effect to provide lift and thrust from a single \"turborotor\" blowing exhaust out the rim of the disk-shaped aircraft to provide anticipated VTOL-like performance. In the air, it would have resembled a flying saucer. Two prototypes were built as \"proof-of-concept\" test vehicles for a more advanced U.S. Air Force fighter and also for a U.S. Army tactical combat aircraft requirement.\n\nAvro's 1956 Project 1794 for the US military designed a larger-scale flying saucer based on the Coandă effect and intended to reach speeds between Mach 3 and Mach 4. Project documents remained classified until 2012.\nThe effect was also implemented during the U.S. Air Force's AMST project. Several aircraft, notably the Boeing YC-14 (the first modern type to exploit the effect), NASA's Quiet Short-Haul Research Aircraft, and the National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan's Asuka research aircraft have been built to take advantage of this effect, by mounting turbofans on the top of the wings to provide high-speed air even at low flying speeds, but to date only one aircraft has gone into production using this system to a major degree, the Antonov An-72 \"Coaler.\" The Shin Meiwa US-1A flying boat utilizes a similar system, only it directs the propwash from its four turboprop engines over the top of the wing to generate low-speed lift. More uniquely, it incorporates a fifth turboshaft engine inside of the wing center-section solely to provide air for powerful blown flaps. The addition of these two systems gives the aircraft an impressive STOL capability.\n\nThe McDonnell Douglas YC-15 and its successor, the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, also employ the effect. The NOTAR helicopter replaces the conventional propeller tail rotor with a Coandă effect tail (diagram on the left).\n\nA milestone in the direction of a better understanding of Coandă effect has been the large scientific literature produced by ACHEON EU FP7 project This project about a particular symmetric nozzle produced an effective modeling of Coandă effect; Das et al., . It has been possible to determine innovative STOL aircraft configurations based on Coanda effect, This activity has been expanded by Dragan in the turbomachinery sector, with the objective of better optimizing the shape of rotating blades by Rumanian Comoti Research Centre's work on turbomachinery.\n\nAn important practical use of the Coandă effect is for inclined hydropower screens, which separate debris, fish, etc., otherwise in the input flow to the turbines. Due to the slope, the debris falls from the screens without mechanical clearing, and due to the wires of the screen optimizing the Coandă effect, the water flows through the screen to the penstocks leading the water to the turbines.\n\nThe Coandă effect is used in dual-pattern fluid dispensers in automobile windshield washers.\nThe operation principle of oscillatory flowmeters also relies on the Coandă phenomenon. The incoming liquid enters a chamber that contains two \"islands.\" Due to the Coandă effect, the main stream splits up and goes under one of the islands. This flow then feeds itself back into the main stream making it split up again, but in the direction of the second isle. This process repeats itself as long as the liquid circulates the chamber, resulting in a self-induced oscillation that is directly proportional to the velocity of the liquid and consequently the volume of substance flowing through the meter. A sensor picks up the frequency of this oscillation and transforms it into an analog signal yielding volume passing through.\n\nIn air conditioning, the Coandă effect is exploited to increase the throw of a ceiling mounted diffuser. Because the Coandă effect causes air discharged from the diffuser to \"stick\" to the ceiling, it travels farther before dropping for the same discharge velocity than it would if the diffuser was mounted in free air, without the neighbouring ceiling. Lower discharge velocity means lower noise levels and, in the case of variable air volume (VAV) air conditioning systems, permits greater turndown ratios. Linear diffusers and slot diffusers that present a greater length of contact with the ceiling exhibit a greater Coandă effect.\n\nIn cardiovascular medicine, the Coandă effect accounts for the separate streams of blood in the fetal right atrium. It also explains why eccentric mitral regurgitation jets are attracted and dispersed along adjacent left atrial wall surfaces (so called \"wall-hugging jets\" as seen on echocardiographic color-doppler interrogation). This is clinically relevant because the visual area (and thus severity) of these eccentric wall-hugging jets is often underestimated compared to the more readily apparent central jets. In these cases, volumetric methods such as the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method are preferred to quantify the severity of mitral regurgitation.\n\nIn medicine, the Coandă effect is used in ventilators.\n\nIn meteorology, the Coandă effect theory has also been applied to some air streams flowing out of mountain ranges such as the Carpathian Mountains and Transylvanian Alps, where effects on agriculture and vegetation have been noted. It also appears to be an effect in the Rhone Valley in France and near Big Delta in Alaska.\n\nIn Formula One automobile racing, the Coandă effect has been exploited by the McLaren, Sauber, Ferrari and Lotus teams, after the first introduction by Adrian Newey (Red Bull Team) in 2011, to help redirect exhaust gases to run through the rear diffuser with the intention of increasing downforce at the rear of the car. Due to changes in regulations set in place by the FIA from the beginning of the 2014 Formula One season, the intention of redirecting exhaust gases to use the Coandă effect have been negated, due to the mandatory requirement that the car exhaust must not have bodywork directly behind the exit for use of aerodynamic effect.\n\nIn fluidics, the Coandă effect was used to build bistable multivibrators, where the working stream (compressed air) stuck to one curved wall or an other and control beams could switch the stream between the walls.\n\nThe Coandă effect is also used to mix two different fluids in a Coandă effect mixer.\n\nThe Coandă effect can be demonstrated by directing a small jet of air upwards at an angle over a ping pong ball. The jet is drawn to and follows the upper surface of the ball curving around it, due to the (radial) acceleration (slowing and turning) of the air around the ball. With enough airflow, this change in momentum is balanced by the equal and opposite force on the ball supporting its weight. This demonstration can be performed using a vacuum cleaner if the outlet can be attached to the pipe and aimed upwards at an angle.\n\nA common misconception is that Coandă effect is demonstrated when a stream of tap water flows over the back of a spoon held lightly in the stream and the spoon is pulled into the stream (for example, Massey in \"Mechanics of Fluids\" uses the Coandă effect to explain the deflection of water around a cylinder). While the flow looks very similar to the air flow over the ping pong ball above (if one could see the air flow), the cause is not really the Coandă effect. Here, because it is a flow of water into air, there is little entrainment of the surrounding fluid (the air) into the jet (the stream of water). This particular demonstration is dominated by surface tension. (McLean in \"Understanding Aerodynamics\" states that the water deflection \"actually demonstrates molecular attraction and surface tension.\")\n\nAnother demonstration is to direct the air flow from, e.g., a vacuum cleaner operating in reverse, tangentially past a round cylinder. A waste basket works well. The air flow seems to \"wrap around\" the cylinder and can be detected at more than 180° from the incoming flow. Under the right conditions, flow rate, weight of the cylinder, smoothness of the surface it sits on, the cylinder actually moves. Note that the cylinder does not move directly into the flow as a misapplication of the Bernoulli effect would predict, but at a diagonal.\n\nThe effect can also be seen by placing a can in front of a lit candle. If one blows directly at the can, the air bends around it and extinguishes the candle.\n\nThe engineering use of Coandă effect has disadvantages as well as advantages.\n\nIn marine propulsion, the efficiency of a propeller or thruster can be severely curtailed by the Coandă effect. The force on the vessel generated by a propeller is a function of the speed, volume and direction of\nthe water jet leaving the propeller. Under certain conditions (e.g., when a ship moves through water) the Coandă effect changes the direction of a propeller jet, causing it to follow the shape of the ship's hull. The side force from a tunnel thruster at the bow of a ship decreases rapidly with forward speed. The side thrust may completely disappear at speeds above about 3 knots.\nIf the Coandă effect is applied to symmetrically shaped nozzles, it presents resonation problems. Those problems and how different spins couple has been analyzed in depth.\n\n"}

{"id": "1436754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1436754", "title": "Earth-Two", "text": "Earth-Two\n\nEarth-Two is a fictional universe appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. First appearing in \"The Flash\" #123 (1961), Earth-Two was created to explain differences between the original Golden Age and then-current Silver Age versions of characters such as the Flash, and how the current (Earth-One) versions could appear in stories with their counterparts. This Earth-Two continuity includes DC Golden Age heroes, including the Justice Society of America, whose careers began at the dawn of World War II, concurrently with their first appearances in comics. Earth-Two, along with the four other surviving Earths of the DC Multiverse, were merged into one in the 1985 miniseries \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\". However, following the events of Infinite Crisis, the Multiverse was reborn, although the subsequent Earth-Two was not the same as its pre-Crisis equivalent.\n\nFollowing the events of Flashpoint, Earth 2 underwent an additional reiteration. While it still houses a team of superheroes, its membership is younger than before. Earth 2 also has a tragic backstory, having been invaded by a horde of alien invaders from Apokolips five years prior to the reboot, ahead of Darkseid's attempted invasion of Prime Earth. In the process, this reality's Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman all died, while its Supergirl and Robin were swept through a dimensional warp to Prime Earth where they became known as Power Girl and Huntress.\n\nCharacters from DC Comics were originally suggestive of each existing in their own world, as superheroes never encountered each other. This was soon changed with alliances being formed between certain protagonists. Several publications, including \"All Star Comics\" (publishing tales of the Justice Society of America), \"Leading Comics\" (publishing tales of the Seven Soldiers of Victory) and other comic books introduced a \"shared universe\" among several characters during the 1940s. By the 1950s, as the popularity of superheroes was waning, comics shifted to horror, westerns and war. Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman were among the few DC continued to publish.\n\nBeginning in the early 1960s, the popularity of superheroes began to grow. DC introduced more modern versions of its heroes, for example, Hawkman was an alien policeman instead of a reincarnated Egyptian prince. The older heroes were assigned to an alternative reality earth.\n\nAlternative-reality Earths had been used in DC stories before, but were usually not referred to after that particular story. Most of these alternative Earths were usually so vastly different that no one would confuse that Earth and its history with the so-called real Earth. That would change when the existence of another reliable Earth was established in a story titled \"Flash of Two Worlds\" in which Barry Allen, the modern Flash later referred to as the Flash of Earth-One (the setting of the Silver Age stories) first travels to another Earth, accidentally vibrating at just the right speed to appear on Earth-Two, where he meets Jay Garrick, his Earth-Two counterpart. He claims Gardner Fox's dreams were tuned into Earth-Two, explaining their depiction as a fictional world in earlier Barry Allen stories.\n\nSuperman was introduced in the 1930s and was the archetype for the modern superhero, and so is depicted in stories set on Earth-Two as the first major reliable costumed superhero on that world, discounting earlier part-time heroes and \"mystery men\" such as Dr. Occult. Most of the following costumed mystery men history is based on the Earth-Two Superman's initial appearance, where these previously independent operating heroes begin to reliably interact. In order to distinguish him from the later primary version of the character, this Superman was called \"Kal-L\", using the spelling of Superman's Kryptonian name in his early appearances. He was specifically introduced as an Earth-Two character in \"Justice League of America\" #73 (1969). Most superheroes from the Golden Age later followed this trend of operating publicly, while wearing distinctive costuming and interacting in a largely shared universe. The primary characters of Superman and Batman still largely worked independent of team environments.\n\nIn the 1970s, as the now annual team up between the Justice League of America and the Justice Society of America had proven popular, DC published the then present day adventures of the Justice Society in the revived All-Star Comics with issue 58, resuming the numbering from the series original run. The story continued in \"Adventure Comics\" #460- 465, which featured the death of the Earth-Two Batman. \"Mr and Mrs Superman\", a feature in \"Superman Family\" (1974–1982), featured stories of the adventures of married Superman and Lois Lane of Earth-Two. These stories were set at a time in which the Superman of Earth-Two was at a similar age to the then-present-day Superman of Earth-One. In the 1980s, DC published \"All-Star Squadron\" which covered the war time history of various superheroes during World War II.\n\n\"Infinity, Inc.\", a group made up of the children and heirs of the Justice Society, was introduced in \"All-Star Squadron\" #25 (September 1983). There was an eponymous comics series starring the group, which ran from March 1984 through June 1988.\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" (1985–1986) was an effort by DC Comics to clean up their continuity, resulting in the multiple universes combining into one. Since then, a handful of characters originating from Earth-Two have consistently remained part of the merged Earth, including Power Girl, Jay Garrick, and Alan Scott. Superman and Lois Lane from Earth-Two (along with Superboy from Earth Prime, and Alexander Luthor, Jr. from Earth-Three) were transported into a ghost-like \"paradise dimension\" tangential to the new universe.\n\nFollowing the end of the known Multiverse, more alternate realities were discovered. Even though Earth-Three was destroyed in the Anti-Monitor's anti-matter wave attacks, a new Crime Syndicate (called the \"Crime Syndicate of Amerika\") developed in the antimatter universe of Qward, which was very different in background and power base from the pre-\"Crisis\" Earth-Three group, though same in the number of members. After the Kingdom event, Hypertime and divergent realities were revealed, but never supposed to be accessed, as stated in the Zero Hour event. They were later revealed when a directly-parallel Flash (Walter West aka the \"Dark Flash\") entered the mainstream DC Universe and threatened to destroy it. These alternate realities are usually addressed as \"Elsewhere\" and \"Elseworld\" stories.\n\nKal-L, Lois Lane-Kent, Superboy-Prime, and Alexander Luthor returned during \"Infinite Crisis\". Unknown to Kal-L, Luthor's plan was to resurrect the pre-\"Crisis\" Multiverse. He wanted to mix and match elements from each reality to create a \"perfect world\". The fallout of the conflict brought the short-lived return of an Earth-Two copy and the deaths of Kal-L, Lois Lane-Kent and Luthor Jr. of Earth-Two. It is unclear what happened to the aged Diana Trevor, the Earth-Two Wonder Woman, though she faded from her ghostly existence. Inexplicably, Earth-Two was the only returning world that was devoid of most people, except the Justice Society, Kal-L, and his wife Lois Kent. This world was a copy, new and recently manufactured by Alexander Luthor, Jr. of pre-\"Crisis\" Earth-Three, instead of resurrected. This copy Earth-Two was recombined with the primary Earth to form the primary DC reality termed as \"New Earth\".\n\nAt the end of the \"Infinite Crisis\" limited series, the realigned world is called \"New Earth\". In the final issue of the \"52\" weekly series, it is revealed that fifty-two duplicate worlds have been created and all but New Earth have been altered from the original incarnation. The post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2 made its first appearance in a single panel of \"52\" Week 52 where it resembled the pre-\"Crisis\" Earth-Two, where a newspaper article says that this world's Superman and Power Girl are missing. The Flashes of New Earth (Jay Garrick and Wally West) briefly glimpsed this world with Robin and Huntress in action (during their travel with the Cosmic Treadmill as shown in Justice Society (vol. 3) #11) and Monarch selected Jay Garrick of this Earth (amongst others) in a .\nBased on comments by \"52\" co-writer Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-\"Crisis\" Earth-Two.\n\nThis separation between the pre-\"Crisis\" Earth-Two and post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2 is formally established in \"Justice Society of America Annual\" #1 (2008), with a story titled \"Earth 2 Chapter One: Golden Age\", in which the New Earth Power Girl arrives on post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2. Thinking that she has returned home to her long destroyed pre-\"Crisis\" Earth-Two. Power Girl crash lands and unconscious, on the closest parallel of the 52 Multiverse, the post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2, which appears similar to the pre-\"Crisis\" Earth-Two. She is found by the post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2 Huntress, who thinks she is her long-missing best friend, the Power Girl native to this world. In this new reality, the Justice Society of America has merged with Infinity, Inc. and is now known as Justice Society Infinity. Initially, Power Girl believes she has returned home, until the missing post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2 Power Girl reappears and declares that the other Power Girl is an impostor, and has caused the disappearance of the post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2 Superman. This turn of events results in the post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2 Power Girl and the Justice Society Infinity to go after the New Earth Power Girl.\n\nThe Power Girl of New Earth recruits the post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2 Michael Holt, who is a physics professor and father and has never become a costumed hero, to help her return to her source Earth. Holt constructs a device similar to the Cosmic treadmill used by Barry Allen to open a portal to New Earth. The Power Girl of New Earth returns home, followed by the Justice Society Infinity, who kidnap her and take her back to post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2. During the confrontation, Green Lantern and Jade are initially confused when they see each other, as the post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2 Jade's father, Alan Scott, is dead, and New Earth's Jade is dead as well. The JSI interrogate Power Girl for information on the post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2 Superman's whereabouts. The post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2 Power Girl assumes that the Superman the New Earth Power Girl said was dead was the post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2 Superman (rather than Kal-L who was killed by Superboy-Prime) and that the New Earth Power Girl had killed him. The Justice Society of New Earth arrives to stop her torture.\nStarman reveals that the re-creation of the Multiverse led to the creation of a Power Girl and Superman native to this new universe, post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2 and that the post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2 Superman is still alive. The Power Girl of New Earth then returns home along with her Justice Society but with no apology from her counterpart nor from the post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2 Huntress for their actions against her.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the Earth-2 concept has been revived and is covered in two series; \"Worlds' Finest\", which focuses on the adventures of the Huntress and Power Girl on New Earth written by Paul Levitz, and \"Earth 2\", originally written by James Robinson and then by Tom Taylor, which features the formation of the Justice Society. James Robinson, the original writer of Earth 2, describes the new Earth 2 as a complete reboot of the concept, with superheroes only just now appearing, similar to the \"young hero\" concept for the New 52 continuity, and with revamped costume designs.\n\nIn \"Earth 2\", Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman seemingly gave their lives in order to repel the Apokoliptan invasion, leaving behind a world with no heroes. Supergirl and Robin (Helena Wayne) end up stranded in the mainstream universe towards the end of the invasion. When the Earth-2 Solomon Grundy threatens the world, three new heroes team up to defeat him: the Flash (Jay Garrick), Hawkgirl (Kendra Saunders), and Green Lantern (Alan Scott). In later issues, Mister Terrific (Michael Holt) from the mainstream universe joins the team. Other heroes who have made appearances include Dr. Fate (Khalid Ben-Hassin), the Atom (Al Pratt, now nuclear-powered), the Sandman (Wesley Dodds), Mister Miracle, and Big Barda. Villains include Solomon Grundy, a now-villainous Terry Sloan, Wotan, Steppenwolf and what was thought to be a surviving, Darkseid-brainwashed Superman, which turned out to be a very powerful but genetically unstable Bizarro-type clone. Writer James Robinson left the series with issue #16 and Tom Taylor became the new writer at #17. Other new characters introduced as the series progresses include a female Red Tornado (with the consciousness of Lois Lane), a hyper-intelligent knowledge-assimilator known as Accountable (Jimmy Olsen), a new Batman (Thomas Wayne using Miraclo), a new version of Aquawoman (Marella), and a new Superman (Val-Zod, a Kryptonian and a childhood friend of Power Girl's who had been imprisoned by Terry Sloan).\n\nTowards the end of the series, Darkseid launches a second invasion of Earth, which is depicted in both \"Earth 2\" and the weekly series \"Earth 2: World's End\". Another weekly series, \"\", depicts a possible future in which refugees from a destroyed Earth 2 come to Earth 0 and prompt society to fracture. Over the course of the series, several new characters are introduced, such as Yolanda Montez, an Avatar of the Red who is a counterpart of Alan Scott; a second Red Arrow, an Earth 2 equivalent of Oliver Queen; and Dick Grayson, a journalist who goes on a mission to find his son after his wife Barbara Gordon is killed during the invasion. Others change alignment; Wonder Woman and Steppenwolf's daughter Fury sides with Mister Miracle and the other heroes after Big Barda reveals her loyalty to Darkseid. Huntress and Power Girl return to Earth 2 as well to take part in a mad scramble to save the Earth and then later, to save its people along with a computerised record of human culture and life on Earth created by Bruce Wayne. In \"Earth 2: World's End\" #11, it is revealed that Highfather made a deal with Darkseid that he would not interfere with Darkseid's plans for conquest so long as Darkseid only preyed upon one Earth of the Multiverse, which was Earth 2, explaining the recurrent tragedies faced by this world in comparison to others. In the end, Darkseid is successful, and the Earth is destroyed, and attempts to take Earth 2's refugees to Earth 0 are prevented by a time travelling Tim Drake in \"Futures End\". Just as the world ends, several of the Wonders are sent to the planet Telos by Brainiac, where they confront their counterparts from various parallel worlds, both present and extinct, in the \"Convergence\" miniseries. Over the course of the series, Batman dies and Dick Grayson, inspired by his Batman counterparts from other worlds, takes up the mantle from Thomas Wayne. Ultimately, the planet Telos is terraformed into a new Earth-like planet and sent to the Earth 2 dimension as a new home for its refugees. The heroes' fraught attempts at forming a new society, rapidly augmented by Terry Sloan's technology, is depicted in the follow-on series \"Earth 2: Society\" (August 2015 – March 2017). The final arc of the series recreates Earth 2 again making it appear similar to their universe's first Earth through use of an Amazon artifact known as Pandora's Casket by Ultra-Humanite. This Earth has had no history of Wonders with Ultra-Humanite controlling the world behind the scenes. Following Ultra-Humanite's defeat, the Wonders becomes the world's new defenders and hopes that this Earth is the Earth they can protect.\n\nA number of characters, heroes and villains, had counterparts on both Earth-One and Two. Generally speaking, the older Earth-Two versions were phased out or incorporated into their younger, Earth-One versions following \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\". Several others were rebooted almost entirely, with their new versions having nothing in common with the old ones. For instance, Jim Corrigan of Earth-Two was a murdered police detective who served as the human host for the Spectre, while his Earth-One counterpart was a Metropolis police officer who often assisted \"Daily Planet\" cub reporter Jimmy Olsen and superhero Black Lightning. Many characters would often travel from one Earth to the other and interact with its natives or even immigrate. For example, Larry Jordan, the first Air Wave and native of Earth-Two, traveled to Earth-One under yet-unexplained circumstances, married Helen (the second Air Wave) and raised a son, Hal (the third Air Wave).\n\nThe history of Earth-Two is slightly different from both real world history and the history of other DC continuities. For example, in classic Earth-Two stories, by the 1970s, Quebec is shown to be an independent nation autonomous from Canada. South Africa abolished apartheid sooner than in the real world, Dukalia, Luxor, Napkan, Nastonia, Oxnalia, Thornia and others were on the Axis side in WW2 and in 1941 in Cliffland a part of the city was destroyed in a volcanic eruption, it rained icebergs that destroyed skyscrapers, and the city was flooded with seawater. Unlike other DCU depictions of Atlantis, the Atlantean countries of Poseidonis and Tritonis were ruled by a queen, not a king (along with its inhabitants displaying surface dweller features and no capacity for underwater survival, as the Atlantis continent had been raised).\n\nIn addition, masked crimefighters are introduced decades earlier than in other universes later identified within DC Comics, and these participated in such historic conflicts as World War II. Franklin Delano Roosevelt founded both the Justice Society of America and the All-Star Squadron. Other events taking place decades earlier include the destruction of Krypton and the advent of advanced technology such as interstellar transportation and time travel.\n\nThousands of years ago, the Guardians of Earth-One's Universe expelled the vast majority of magic from their universe, sending it to Earth-Two. This resulted in a predominance of magic and a weakening of scientific laws within Earth-Two's universe.\n\nBecause Earth-Two as presented didn't match up with the actual comics of DC's Golden Age other alternative Earths were used to explain the discrepancies. \n\nEarth-Two-A (also known as Alternate Earth-Two) was where Clark Kent worked for the \"Daily Planet\" under editor Parry White in the 1940s and 1950s (on regular Earth-Two Kent worked for the \"Daily Star\", his editor was George Taylor, and Perry White was a reporter).\n\nEarth-Two-B (aka Earth-Forty-Six) is a world referenced but not described in the \"Crisis On Infinite Earths: Absolute Edition\".\n\nEarth-E (Earth-216) is the world where the Super-Sons adventures happened and was used to explain 1950s Batman and Superman stories that didn't fit with either Earth-One or Earth-Two history. Mark Gruenwald assigned it to the 1951–1960 period of those books.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "392309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=392309", "title": "Founder effect", "text": "Founder effect\n\nIn population genetics, the founder effect is the loss of genetic variation that occurs when a new population is established by a very small number of individuals from a larger population. It was first fully outlined by Ernst Mayr in 1942, using existing theoretical work by those such as Sewall Wright. As a result of the loss of genetic variation, the new population may be distinctively different, both genotypically and phenotypically, from the parent population from which it is derived. In extreme cases, the founder effect is thought to lead to the speciation and subsequent evolution of new species.\n\nIn the figure shown, the original population has nearly equal numbers of blue and red individuals. The three smaller founder populations show that one or the other color may predominate (founder effect), due to random sampling of the original population. A population bottleneck may also cause a founder effect, though it is not strictly a new population.\n\nThe founder effect occurs when a small group of migrants that is not genetically representative of the population from which they came establish in a new area. In addition to founder effects, the new population is often a very small population, so shows increased sensitivity to genetic drift, an increase in inbreeding, and relatively low genetic variation.\n\nIn genetics, a founder mutation is a mutation that appears in the DNA of one or more individuals which are founders of a distinct population. Founder mutations initiate with changes that occur in the DNA and can be passed down to other generations. The mutation may occur in any organism that becomes a founder of the line of descendants containing that mutation, which could be as simple as a virus, a goat, or a more complex human.\n\nFounder mutations originate in long stretches of DNA on a single chromosome; indeed, the original haplotype is the whole chromosome. As the generations progress, the proportion of the haplotype that is common to all carriers of the mutation is shortened (due to genetic recombination). This shortening allows scientists to roughly estimate the age of the mutation.\n\nThe founder effect is a special case of genetic drift, occurring when a small group in a population splinters off from the original population and forms a new one. The new colony may have less genetic variation than the original population, and through the random sampling of alleles during reproduction of subsequent generations, continue rapidly towards fixation. This consequence of inbreeding makes the colony more vulnerable to extinction.\n\nWhen a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population's genetic makeup far into the future. In humans, who have a slow reproduction rate, the population will remain small for many generations, effectively amplifying the drift effect generation after generation until the population reaches a certain size. Alleles which were present but relatively rare in the original population can move to one of two extremes. The most common one is that the allele is soon lost altogether, but the other possibility is that the allele survives and within a few generations has become much more dispersed throughout the population. The new colony can experience an increase in the frequency of recessive alleles, as well, and as a result, an increased number who are homozygous for certain recessive traits.\n\nThe variation in gene frequency between the original population and colony may also trigger the two groups to diverge significantly over the course of many generations. As the variance, or genetic distance, increases, the two separated populations may become distinctively different, both genetically and phenotypically, although not only genetic drift, but also natural selection, gene flow and mutation all contribute to this divergence. This potential for relatively rapid changes in the colony's gene frequency led most scientists to consider the founder effect (and by extension, genetic drift) a significant driving force in the evolution of new species. Sewall Wright was the first to attach this significance to random drift and small, newly isolated populations with his shifting balance theory of speciation. Following behind Wright, Ernst Mayr created many persuasive models to show that the decline in genetic variation and small population size accompanying the founder effect were critically important for new species to develop. However, much less support for this view is shown today, since the hypothesis has been tested repeatedly through experimental research, and the results have been equivocal at best. Speciation by genetic drift is a specific case of peripatric speciation which in itself occurs in rare instances. It takes place when a random change in genetic frequency of population favours the survival of a few organisms of the species with rare genes which cause reproductive mutation. These surviving organisms then breed among themselves over a long period of time to create a whole new species whose reproductive systems or behaviors are no longer compatible with the original population. \n\nSerial founder effects have occurred when populations migrate over long distances. Such long-distance migrations typically involve relatively rapid movements followed by periods of settlement. The populations in each migration carry only a subset of the genetic diversity carried from previous migrations. As a result, genetic differentiation tends to increase with geographic distance as described by the \"isolation by distance\" model. The migration of humans out of Africa is characterized by serial founder effects. Africa has the highest degree of genetic diversity of any continent, which is consistent with an African origin of modern humans. After the initial migration from Africa, the Indian subcontinent was the first major settling point for modern humans. Consequently, India has the second-highest genetic diversity in the world. In general, the genetic diversity of the Indian subcontinent is a subset of Africa, and the genetic diversity outside Africa is a subset of India.\n\nFounder populations are essential to the study of island biogeography and island ecology. A natural \"blank slate\" is not easily found, but a classic series of studies on founder population effects was done following the catastrophic 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, which erased all life on the island. Another continuing study has been following the biocolonization of Surtsey, Iceland, a new volcanic island that erupted offshore between 1963 and 1967. An earlier event, the Toba eruption in Sumatra about 73,000 years ago, covered some parts of India with of ash, and must have coated the Nicobar Islands and Andaman Islands, much nearer in the ash fallout cone, with life-smothering layers, forcing the restart of their biodiversity.\n\nHowever, not all founder effect studies are initiated after a natural disaster; some scientists study the reinstatement of a species that became locally extinct. Hajji and others, and Hundertmark & Van Daele, studied the current population statuses of past founder effects in Corsican red deer and Alaskan elk, respectively. Corsican red deer are still listed as an endangered species, decades after a severe bottleneck. They inhabit the Tyrrhenian islands and surrounding mainlands currently, and before the bottleneck, but Hajji and others wanted to know how the deer originally got to the islands, and from what parent population or species they were derived. Through molecular analysis, they were able to determine a possible lineage, with red deer from the islands of Corsica and Sardinia being the most related to one another. These results are promising, as the island of Corsica was repopulated with red deer from the Sardinian island after the original Corsican red deer population became extinct, and the deer now inhabiting the island of Corsica are diverging from those inhabiting Sardinia.\n\nKolbe and others set up a pair of genetically sequenced and morphologically examined lizards on seven small islands to watch each new population's growth and adaptation to its new environment. Specifically, they were looking at the effects on limb length and perch width, both widely varying phenotypic ranges in the parent population. Unfortunately, immigration did occur, but the founder effect and adaptive differentiation, which could eventually lead to peripatric speciation, were statistically and biologically significant between the island populations after a few years. The authors also point out that although adaptive differentiation is significant, the differences between island populations best reflect the differences between founders and their genetic diversity that has been passed down through the generations.\n\nDue to various migrations throughout human history, founder effects are somewhat common among humans in different times and places. The French Canadians of Quebec are a classical example of founder population. Over 150 years of French colonization, between 1608 and 1760, an estimated 8,500 pioneers married and left at least one descendant on the territory. Following the takeover of the colony by the British crown in 1760, immigration from France effectively stopped, but descendents of French settlers continued to grow in number mainly because of high fertility rate. Intermarriage occurred mostly with the deported Acadians and migrants coming from the British Isles. Since the 20th century, immigration in Quebec and mixing of French Canadians involve people from all over the world. While the French Canadians of Quebec today may be partly of other ancestries, the genetic contribution of the original French founders is predominant, explaining about 90% of regional gene pools, while Acadians (descended from other French settlers in eastern Canada) explain 4%, British 2% and Native American and other groups contributed less.\n\nIn humans, founder effects can arise from cultural isolation, and inevitably, endogamy. For example, the Amish populations in the United States exhibit founder effects because they have grown from a very few founders, have not recruited newcomers, and tend to marry within the community. Though still rare, phenomena such as polydactyly (extra fingers and toes, a symptom of a condition such as Weyers acrodental dysostosis or Ellis-van Creveld syndrome) are more common in Amish communities than in the American population at large. Maple syrup urine disease affects about one out of 180,000 infants in the general population. Due in part to the founder effect, however, the disease has a much higher prevalence in children of Amish, Mennonite, and Jewish descent. Similarly, a high frequency of fumarase deficiency exists among the 10,000 members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a community which practices both endogamy and polygyny, where an estimated 75 to 80% of the community are blood relatives of just two men—founders John Y. Barlow and Joseph Smith Jessop.\n\nAround 1814, a small group of British colonists founded a settlement on Tristan da Cunha, a group of small islands in the Atlantic Ocean, midway between Africa and South America. One of the early colonists apparently carried a rare, recessive allele for retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive form of blindness that afflicts homozygous individuals. As late as 1961, the majority of the genes in the gene pool on Tristan were still derived from 15 original ancestors; as a consequence of the inbreeding, of 232 people tested in 1961, four were suffering from retinitis pigmentosa. This represents a prevalence of 1 in 58, compared with a worldwide prevalence of around 1 in 4,000.\n\nThe abnormally high rate of twin births in Cândido Godói could be explained by the founder effect.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21188370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21188370", "title": "Fuel", "text": "Fuel\n\nA fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases energy as heat energy or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion).\n\nThe heat energy released by reactions of fuels is converted into mechanical energy via a heat engine. Other times the heat itself is valued for warmth, cooking, or industrial processes, as well as the illumination that comes with combustion. Fuels are also used in the cells of organisms in a process known as cellular respiration, where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy. Hydrocarbons and related oxygen-containing molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other substances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized.\n\nFuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy, such as those that directly release electrical energy (such as batteries and capacitors) or mechanical energy (such as flywheels, springs, compressed air, or water in a reservoir).\n\nThe first known use of fuel was the combustion of wood or sticks by \"Homo erectus\" nearly two million years ago. Throughout most of human history fuels derived from plants or animal fat were only used by humans. Charcoal, a wood derivative, has been used since at least 6,000 BCE for melting metals. It was only supplanted by coke, derived from coal, as European forests started to become depleted around the 18th century. Charcoal briquettes are now commonly used as a fuel for barbecue cooking.\n\nCoal was first used as a fuel around 1000 BCE in China. With the energy in the form of chemical energy that could be released through combustion, but the concept \ndevelopment of the steam engine in the United Kingdom in 1769, coal came into more common use as a power source. Coal was later used to drive ships and locomotives. By the 19th century, gas extracted from coal was being used for street lighting in London. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the primary use of coal is to generate electricity, providing 40% of the world's electrical power supply in 2005.\n\nFossil fuels were rapidly adopted during the Industrial Revolution, because they were more concentrated and flexible than traditional energy sources, such as water power. They have become a pivotal part of our contemporary society, with most countries in the world burning fossil fuels in order to produce power.\n\nCurrently the trend has been towards renewable fuels, such as biofuels like alcohols.\n\nChemical fuels are substances that release energy by reacting with substances around them, most notably by the process of combustion. Most of the chemical energy released in combustion was not stored in the chemical bonds of the fuel, but in the weak double bond of molecular oxygen.\n\nChemical fuels are divided in two ways. First, by their physical properties, as a solid, liquid or gas. Secondly, on the basis of their occurrence: \"primary (natural fuel)\" and \"secondary (artificial fuel)\". Thus, a general classification of chemical fuels is:\n\nSolid fuel refers to various types of solid material that are used as fuel to produce energy and provide heating, usually released through combustion. Solid fuels include wood , charcoal, peat, coal, hexamine fuel tablets, and pellets made from wood (see wood pellets), corn, wheat, rye and other grains. Solid-fuel rocket technology also uses solid fuel (see solid propellants). Solid fuels have been used by humanity for many years to create fire. Coal was the fuel source which enabled the industrial revolution, from firing furnaces, to running steam engines. Wood was also extensively used to run steam locomotives. Both peat and coal are still used in electricity generation today.\nThe use of some solid fuels (e.g. coal) is restricted or prohibited in some urban areas, due to unsafe levels of toxic emissions. The use of other solid fuels as wood is decreasing as heating technology and the availability of good quality fuel improves. In some areas, smokeless coal is often the only solid fuel used. In Ireland, peat briquettes are used as smokeless fuel. They are also used to start a coal fire.\n\nLiquid fuels are combustible or energy-generating molecules that can be harnessed to create mechanical energy, usually producing kinetic energy; they also must take the shape of their container. It is the fumes of liquid fuels that are flammable instead of the fluid.\n\nMost liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from the fossilized remains of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure inside the Earth's crust. However, there are several types, such as hydrogen fuel (for automotive uses), ethanol, jet fuel and bio-diesel which are all categorized as a liquid fuel. Emulsified fuels of oil-in-water such as orimulsion have been developed a way to make heavy oil fractions usable as liquid fuels. Many liquid fuels play a primary role in transportation and the economy.\n\nSome common properties of liquid fuels are that they are easy to transport, and that can be handled easily. Also they are relatively easy to use for all engineering applications, and home use. Fuels like kerosene are rationed in some countries, for example available in government subsidized shops in India for home use.\n\nConventional diesel is similar to gasoline in that it is a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons extracted from petroleum. Kerosene is used in kerosene lamps and as a fuel for cooking, heating, and small engines. Natural gas, composed chiefly of methane, can only exist as a liquid at very low temperatures (regardless of pressure), which limits its direct use as a liquid fuel in most applications. LP gas is a mixture of propane and butane, both of which are easily compressible gases under standard atmospheric conditions. It offers many of the advantages of compressed natural gas (CNG), but is denser than air, does not burn as cleanly, and is much more easily compressed. Commonly used for cooking and space heating, LP gas and compressed propane are seeing increased use in motorized vehicles; propane is the third most commonly used motor fuel globally.\n\nFuel gas is any one of a number of fuels that are gaseous under ordinary conditions. Many fuel gases are composed of hydrocarbons (such as methane or propane), hydrogen, carbon monoxide, or mixtures thereof. Such gases are sources of potential heat energy or light energy that can be readily transmitted and distributed through pipes from the point of origin directly to the place of consumption. Fuel gas is contrasted with liquid fuels and from solid fuels, though some fuel gases are liquefied for storage or transport. While their gaseous nature can be advantageous, avoiding the difficulty of transporting solid fuel and the dangers of spillage inherent in liquid fuels, it can also be dangerous. It is possible for a fuel gas to be undetected and collect in certain areas, leading to the risk of a gas explosion. For this reason, odorizers are added to most fuel gases so that they may be detected by a distinct smell. The most common type of fuel gas in current use is natural gas.\n\nBiofuel can be broadly defined as solid, liquid, or gas fuel consisting of, or derived from biomass. Biomass can also be used directly for heating or power—known as \"biomass fuel\". Biofuel can be produced from any carbon source that can be replenished rapidly e.g. plants. Many different plants and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacture.\n\nPerhaps the earliest fuel employed by humans is wood. Evidence shows controlled fire was used up to 1.5 million years ago at Swartkrans, South Africa. It is unknown which hominid species first used fire, as both \"Australopithecus\" and an early species of \"Homo\" were present at the sites. As a fuel, wood has remained in use up until the present day, although it has been superseded for many purposes by other sources. Wood has an energy density of 10–20 MJ/kg.\n\nRecently biofuels have been developed for use in automotive transport (for example Bioethanol and Biodiesel), but there is widespread public debate about how carbon efficient these fuels are.\n\nFossil fuels are hydrocarbons, primarily coal and petroleum (liquid petroleum or natural gas), formed from the fossilized remains of ancient plants and animals by exposure to high heat and pressure in the absence of oxygen in the Earth's crust over hundreds of millions of years. Commonly, the term fossil fuel also includes hydrocarbon-containing natural resources that are not derived entirely from biological sources, such as tar sands. These latter sources are properly known as \"mineral fuels\".\n\nFossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include coal, petroleum, and natural gas.\nThey range from volatile materials with low carbon:hydrogen ratios like methane, to liquid petroleum to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon, like anthracite coal. Methane can be found in hydrocarbon fields, alone, associated with oil, or in the form of methane clathrates. Fossil fuels formed from the fossilized remains of dead plants by exposure to heat and pressure in the Earth's crust over millions of years. This biogenic theory was first introduced by German scholar Georg Agricola in 1556 and later by Mikhail Lomonosov in the 18th century.\n\nIt was estimated by the Energy Information Administration that in 2007 primary sources of energy consisted of petroleum 36.0%, coal 27.4%, natural gas 23.0%, amounting to an 86.4% share for fossil fuels in primary energy consumption in the world. Non-fossil sources in 2006 included hydroelectric 6.3%, nuclear 8.5%, and others (geothermal, solar, tidal, wind, wood, waste) amounting to 0.9%. World energy consumption was growing about 2.3% per year.\n\nFossil fuels are non-renewable resources because they take millions of years to form, and reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made. So we must conserve these fuels and use them judiciously. The production and use of fossil fuels raise environmental concerns. A global movement toward the generation of renewable energy is therefore under way to help meet increased energy needs. The burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion tonnes (21.3 gigatonnes) of carbon dioxide (CO) per year, but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year (one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44/12 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide). Carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that enhances radiative forcing and contributes to global warming, causing the average surface temperature of the Earth to rise in response, which the vast majority of climate scientists agree will cause major adverse effects.\nFuels are a source of energy.\n\nThe amount of energy from different types of fuel depends on the stoichiometric ratio, the chemically correct air and fuel ratio to ensure complete combustion of fuel, and its specific energy, the energy per unit mass.\n1 MJ ≈ 0.28 kWh ≈ 0.37 HPh.\n\nNuclear fuel is any material that is consumed to derive nuclear energy. Technically speaking, all matter can be a nuclear fuel because any element under the right conditions will release nuclear energy, but the materials commonly referred to as nuclear fuels are those that will produce energy without being placed under extreme duress. Nuclear fuel is a material that can be 'burned' by nuclear fission or fusion to derive nuclear energy. \"Nuclear fuel\" can refer to the fuel itself, or to physical objects (for example bundles composed of fuel rods) composed of the fuel material, mixed with structural, neutron moderating, or neutron reflecting materials.\n\nMost nuclear fuels contain heavy fissile elements that are capable of nuclear fission. When these fuels are struck by neutrons, they are in turn capable of emitting neutrons when they break apart. This makes possible a self-sustaining chain reaction that releases energy with a controlled rate in a nuclear reactor or with a very rapid uncontrolled rate in a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe most common fissile nuclear fuels are uranium-235 (U) and plutonium-239 (Pu). The actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of nuclear fuel together make up the nuclear fuel cycle. Not all types of nuclear fuels create power from nuclear fission. Plutonium-238 and some other elements are used to produce small amounts of nuclear power by radioactive decay in radioisotope thermoelectric generators and other types of atomic batteries. Also, light nuclides such as tritium (H) can be used as fuel for nuclear fusion.\nNuclear fuel has the highest energy density of all practical fuel sources.\n\nThe most common type of nuclear fuel used by humans is heavy fissile elements that can be made to undergo nuclear fission chain reactions in a nuclear fission reactor; \"nuclear fuel\" can refer to the material or to physical objects (for example fuel bundles composed of fuel rods) composed of the fuel material, perhaps mixed with structural, neutron moderating, or neutron reflecting materials. The most common fissile nuclear fuels are U and Pu, and the actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of these elements together make up the nuclear fuel cycle, which is important for its relevance to nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons.\n\nFuels that produce energy by the process of nuclear fusion are currently not utilized by humans but are the main source of fuel for stars. Fusion fuels tend to be light elements such as hydrogen which will combine easily. Energy is required to start fusion by raising temperature so high all materials would turn into plasma, and allow nuclei to collide and stick together with each other before repelling due to electric charge. This process is called fusion and it can give out energy.\n\nIn stars that undergo nuclear fusion, fuel consists of atomic nuclei that can release energy by the absorption of a proton or neutron. In most stars the fuel is provided by hydrogen, which can combine to form helium through the proton-proton chain reaction or by the CNO cycle. When the hydrogen fuel is exhausted, nuclear fusion can continue with progressively heavier elements, although the net energy released is lower because of the smaller difference in nuclear binding energy. Once iron-56 or nickel-56 nuclei are produced, no further energy can be obtained by nuclear fusion as these have the highest nuclear binding energies. The elements then on use up energy instead of giving off energy when fused. Therefore, fusion stops and the star dies. In attempts by humans, fusion is only carried out with hydrogen (isotope of 2 and 3) to form helium-4 as this reaction gives out the most net energy. Electric confinement (ITER), inertial confinement(heating by laser) and heating by strong electric currents are the popular methods used. .\n\nThe World Bank reported that the USA was the top fuel importer in 2005 followed by the EU and Japan.\n\nMost transportation fuels are liquids, because vehicles usually require high energy density. This occurs naturally in liquids and solids. High energy density can also be provided by an internal combustion engine. These engines require clean-burning fuels. The fuels that are easiest to burn cleanly are typically liquids and gases. Thus, liquids meet the requirements of being both energy-dense and clean-burning. In addition, liquids (and gases) can be pumped, which means handling is easily mechanized, and thus less laborious.\n\n"}
{"id": "56616791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56616791", "title": "Gorlice Ghetto", "text": "Gorlice Ghetto\n\nThe Gorlice Ghetto was established in the year 1940 after German occupation of the Polish city began on September 7, 1939. As one of many ghettos created by Nazi Germany in the General Government, its establishment meant further persecution and violence against the nearly 3,400 Jewish citizens that were settled in the area. As German forces quickly seized hundreds of the young, able men of Gorlice in order to use them for forced labor, many Jews began hiding for their lives as their businesses were taken and the rapid spread of disease plagued the city. The ghetto was officially dissolved on September 14, 1942, and carried with its downfall the transportation of hundreds of Jews to the concentration camp located in Bełżec.\n\nIn Gorlice, the German occupation of September 7, 1939 marked the beginnings of establishing a ghetto in the city, as the Wehrmacht began taking Jews from their homes, robbing them of earthly possessions, and forcing them into labor-intensive work. Jewish businesses were taken over and implemented into fabricated \"trustee\" groups by the Germans. Though some owners were granted access to keep their businesses running, many women ended up taking over the establishments, as the Jewish men went into hiding, attempting to escape from a life of forced labor by the Reich.\n\nDuring the first year of occupation, the Jewish population of Gorlice actually increased, despite the increase of violence in the area and the initial move many residents took beginning at the outbreak of the war in Europe. Hundreds of refugees from Germany poured into the city following increases of violence instances within the country, most famously that of Kristallnacht. With this increase in community size, food shortages became a problem for families in the area. Soup kitchens, like those opened by Judenrat in 1940, were rare sources of nourishment for the thousands of refugees.\n\nSmuggling food became a necessary part of survival for many Jews occupying Gorlice, many obtaining sustenance from the neighboring country of Slovakia, nearly nineteen miles away from the location of the ghetto. The ghetto itself was guarded by Ukrainian police officials and, though they were firm in serving the local Gestapo, some officers aided the Jews inside by helping them to smuggling food supplies like coffee, tea, and cocoa into Gorlice. This kind of desperation was indicative of the overarching Nazi motive behind ghettoization of so many parts of Europe, that being to drain all physical elements of worth from the Jewish people in hopes to drive them out of what was to become a greater German population. The hard conditions and starvation within the occupied areas was meant to force the Jews to sell all their earthly possessions in order to afford food and drink to survive. Soon, many families found themselves drained of all resources and food became a \"luxury\" of the \"wealthy.\"\n\nThe ghettos in German occupied Poland in the early 1940s became overrun with sickness and fatal diseases. Due to lack of proper nutrition or resources, it became a common occurrence to have entire families ill to the point of no return with little means to cure their ailments. Until 1941, no Jewish doctors were given access to help patients leaving many dead from lack of proper healthcare. Late 1940 saw a small hospital open for affected Jews through funding from the Judenrat and Jewish doctors and physicians from the Kraków district from the JSS (Jewish Self Help) organization. Though this was all set up with good intention, little funding translated into gaining access to vital medicines, leaving many with a lack of aid. Notably, the Dr. Otstanki \"put aside his antisemitic convictions\" and attempted to attend to the sick of Gorlice, at great risk of being persecuted by Nazi SS forces. Other doctors, like Dr. Feldmaus arrived in 1941, and by fall there were two dental service posts opened within the ghetto.\n\nGerman SS forces controlled nearly every aspect of life for the Jews within the Gorlice Ghetto, and instances of intense violence or discrimination were common within the area. Beatings of Jewish men, women, and children on public streets became part of living in the ghetto, and vicious kidnapping of Jewish men in hiding happened more often than not, leading to more Jews being forced into going to labor camps. As the Judenrat became a bigger source of aid to the Jews in Gorlice, they began to feed into Nazi opposition. Rumors in 1942 flew about that the ghetto would soon be liquidated, and in an effort to enforce their control over the Jewish citizens of the occupied territory, Nazi forces ordered all the men of the ghetto to the town square. They demanded for 250,000 złoty, an amount unpayable by the starving and poor living in Gorlice. Many hid from the SS forces in an effort to escape this persecution, and all who were found hiding were shot on site. Some Jews from the square were selected to go to the Płaszow concentration camp, were forced to undress, and were shot against open mass graves. Members of the Jewish Police and the Judenrat were lined against buildings with their families and, one by one, were murdered. Some laborers whose work proved \"essential\" to the German forces were kept alive, transported to paper factories, and were continuously forced to work. All other Jews who were no longer needed were taken to a shoe factory miles away, being starved of for the three day journey.\n"}
{"id": "11080148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11080148", "title": "Growing Up in the Universe", "text": "Growing Up in the Universe\n\nGrowing Up in the Universe was a series of lectures given by Richard Dawkins as part of the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, in which he discussed the evolution of life in the universe.\n\nThe lectures were first broadcast in 1991, in the form of five one-hour episodes, on the BBC in the United Kingdom. The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science was granted the rights to the televised lectures, and a DVD version was released by the foundation on 20 April 2007.\n\nDawkins' book \"Climbing Mount Improbable\" developed from the ideas presented in the lectures, and the title itself is taken from the third lecture in the series.\n\nTo start off part one, Dawkins discusses the amazing capabilities of the human body and contrasts these with the limited capabilities of computers and other man-made machines. He uses a small totem pole (which is used in ancestor worship) to illustrate the importance of studying our ancestors to understand how we've evolved. To contrast ease of reproduction with the difficulty of becoming an ancestor, Dawkins uses the example of paper folding to explain exponential growth. Dawkins then tells the audience that exponential growth does not generally happen in the real world - natural factors come into play which control the population numbers, meaning that only an elite group of organisms will actually become distant ancestors. To be in this elite group, the organism must \"have what it takes\" to survive and pass on their genes to offspring.\n\nThe long chain of successful ancestors means that the probability of our existence is very small, and we are lucky to be alive. By turning down the lights and shining a small spotlight on a large ruler in front of him, Dawkins illustrates the darkness of the distant past and of the unknown future.\n\nAfter expounding on how lucky we are to be alive, and urging us not to waste the precious time that we have, Dawkins brings up the usefulness of science in aiding our understanding of the universe. He mentions the reply that Michael Faraday gave to Sir Robert Peel when asked about the use of science. Faraday's response was \"What is the use of a baby?\" Dawkins explains that Faraday was either referring to the vast potential of a baby, or to the idea that there must be something more to life than growing up, working, getting old, and dying. There must be a point to it all; Perhaps science can uncover the answers to our biggest questions.\n\nTo shake off the \"anesthetic of familiarity,\" Dawkins shows the audience a number of strange terrestrial organisms which he humorously nicknames \"By-Jovians,\" playing off a term we might use to refer to living organisms from another planet, for instance Jupiter. He uses a scanning electron microscope to look at small organisms including mites, mosquitoes, and a bee being parasitized by a strepsiptera. Using a model of a eukaryotic cell, he discusses the mitochondria and presents the audience with a complicated diagram of the metabolic pathways.\n\nDawkins suggests that we can also shake off the familiarity by stepping backwards in time. By using a single pace to represent going back 1000 years, he starts at year zero and takes four steps in front of his desk, going back to 4000 BCE. Pointing to a portrait of Homo habilis, he states that to go back to the time of habilis, he would have to walk about two kilometers. He has audience members hold up portraits of other human ancestors, telling them how far he would have to walk to get back to the time of each one.\n\nBy imagining what an advanced alien species would think of humans if they were to arrive on Earth, Dawkins suggests that their science would be similar to ours. They would know about pi, the Pythagorean theorem, and the theory of relativity. However, Dawkins explains that the alien anthropologists would most likely scoff at our local, parochial religious beliefs. He then contrasts evidence-based beliefs with revealed, tradition-based, and authority-based beliefs.\n\nTo explain the problem with beliefs in the supernatural, Dawkins conducts a small experiment with the audience to \"find the psychic.\" Using a coin, he assigns half the audience to will it to land on heads, and assigns the other half to will it to land on tails. After each flip, the section of the audience that was wrong is eliminated from the experiment, and he repeats the experiment using the remainder. After eight coin flips, only one boy in the audience remains. Dawkins then asks the question \"Is he psychic?\" Obviously, because of how the experiment was set up, one person was bound to have been correct about the result of each coin flip. Dawkins argues that this is exactly how seemingly supernatural events occur in the real world, especially when the \"audience\" is the entire population of the planet.\n\nTo conclude the lecture, Dawkins claims that there is nothing wrong with having faith in a proper scientific prediction. To illustrate this, he takes a cannonball which has been suspended from the ceiling with a rope, pulls it aside and touches it to his forehead. He announces that he is going to release the cannonball, letting it swing away from him, and that when it comes back to him, he is going to ignore his natural instinct to run because he has faith in his scientific prediction of what will happen - the cannonball should stop about an inch short of his forehead. He releases the cannonball, and his prediction is proved correct.\n\nDawkins' second lecture of the series examines the problem of design. He presents the audience with a number of simple objects, such as rocks and crystals, and notes that these objects have been formed by simple laws of physics and are therefore not designed. He then examines some designed objects - including a microscope, an electronic calculator, a pocket watch,\nand a clay pot - and notes that none of these objects could have possibly come about by sheer luck. Dawkins then discusses what he calls \"designoid objects\", which are complex objects that are neither simple, nor designed. Not only are they complex on the outside, they are also complex on the inside - perhaps billions of times more complex than a designed object such as a microscope.\n\nDawkins then shows the audience a number of designed and designoid objects, including the pitcher plant, megalithic mounds built by the compass termite, and pots made by trapdoor spiders, potter wasps, and mason bees. He examines some designoid objects that use camouflage, such as a grasshopper that looks like a stone, a sea horse that looks like sea weed, a leaf insect, a green snake, a stick insect, and a collection of butterflies that look like dead leaves when their wings are closed. Dawkins notes that many animals share similar types of camouflage or protection because of a process called convergent evolution. Examples of such designoid objects include the hedgehog and the spiny anteater (both of which evolved pointed spines along their back) and the marsupial wolf (which looks like a dog but is actually a marsupial). He illustrates the reason why convergent evolution occurs by using two small models of commercial aircraft. The reason they look similar isn't due to industrial espionage, it is due to the fact that they are both built to fly, so they must make use of similar design principles.\n\nUsing a camera and a model eye, Dawkins then compares the designed camera with the designoid eye. Both are involved in similar processes - using a lens to direct light onto a film or a retina. Both the camera and the eye also have an iris, which is used to control the amount of light which is allowed in. Using a volunteer from the audience, Dawkins demonstrates the contraction of the human\niris by shining a light into her right eye.\n\nThe lecture then moves into an explanation of natural selection, which brings forth designoid objects. To explain natural selection, Dawkins first explains artificial selection by discussing the evolution of wild cabbage into broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, red cabbage, kohlrabi, and Brussels sprouts. He continues the discussion of artificial selection by explaining the evolution of the ancestral wolf into the many varieties of modern dog. Starting with the ancestral wolf, Dawkins imagines that everyone on one side of the room is breeding for small wolves, while everyone on the other side is breeding for big wolves. By selectively breeding the smallest or largest of each litter for a number of years, you may eventually end up with something like the Chihuahua on one side of the room, and something like a Great Dane on the other side of the room.\n\nDawkins then introduces an Arthromorphs computer program (similar to the Biomorphs program), explaining how it works while a volunteer uses the computer to selectively breed more and more generations.\n\nAt this point, Dawkins switches from explaining artificial selection to explaining natural selection. To demonstrate natural selection in a computer program, Dawkins uses a program written by Peter Fuchs to simulate the evolution of the spiderweb. The program builds \"genetic\" variations of a parent web, as if the web was actually being built by a child spider. For each generation, a simulation is run which randomly generates flies - some of which will hit the web, and others that will miss it. The child web that is able to capture the highest number of flies is selected as the parent for the next generation of webs. Dawkins shows the audience the \"fossil record\" that the program recorded after simulating a large number of generations overnight. The web starts off very simple and inefficient, but by the end it has evolved into a web that is highly efficient and highly complex. This is the same process that has led to the existence of all designoid objects.\n\nDawkins now discusses the most popular alternative to natural selection, which is known as creationism. He explains that creationists mistakenly believe designoid objects to be designed objects created by a divine being. Quoting from William Paley's \"Natural Theology\", Dawkins discusses the argument from design using the example of the watch and the watchmaker. Even though designoid objects appear to be designed, Darwin proved that this is not the case. Although Darwin's theory was discovered well after Paley developed his watchmaker argument, Dawkins explains that the argument of a divine watchmaker was still a bad argument, even in Paley's day. Paraphrasing David Hume, Dawkins explains that anything capable of creating humans must itself be highly complicated. Thus, the argument from design actually explains nothing - \"shooting itself in the foot.\" While it is true that designoid objects cannot come about by chance, evolution provides a non-random method of creation - namely, natural selection.\n\nAfter developing the argument against a divine creator, Dawkins examines a number of designoid objects that contain imperfections, which is something you would not expect to find in an object that is supposedly created by a divine being. Showing the audience a halibut flatfish, he explains how they evolved from an upright swimming ancestor with one eye on each side of the head into a bottom-hugging flatfish with a distorted set of eyes on one side of the body. Dawkins claims that this is poorly designed, as any proper engineer would design an organism more like a skate, which flattened out on its belly instead of on its side. This is an example of something you would expect from an evolved/designoid object, but not something you would expect from a created/designed object.\n\nUsing labeled building blocks, Dawkins shows the audience how designed objects came to be. He starts off by placing the simple block on the bottom, and explaining that you don't have to start with a complex being, but can start with a very simple foundation. If you have a simple foundation, you can place the next block on top - the designoid block. From this block, you can get complex organisms. Only after complex designoid objects come to be can you get the final building block of design (microscopes, clay pots, etc.).\n\nDawkins starts the lecture coming in with a stick insect on his hand. He describes with how many details such a being imitates its environment, its almost like a key that fits a lock. He then shows another insect, namely a Leaf Insect, which basically looks exactly like a dead leaf. He gives some more examples for this amazing imitation of the surrounding, e.g. a Potoo, which looks like a branch of tree and a thorn bug, which gains protection by looking like a rose thorn.\n\nHe, once again, makes the point that you can compare these beings with a key, which they represent themselves, whereas nature is the lock. Professor Richard Dawkins then explains that a key has to fit a lock exactly, and demonstrates this with a model of a lock. He mentions that a key is something very improbable. However it is hard to measure the probability of such a key, therefore Dawkins takes a bicycle lock for illustration, where you can calculate how likely it is to open the lock, because there is a fixed number of dials with a fixed number of positions. In Dawkin's case we have 3 dials, with 6 positions each, so the probability that you open the lock by sheer luck is one in 216.\n\nDawkins then shows the mechanism of the lock with a big model: Each dial has to be in the correct position in order to open up the lock. The model is then adapted to demonstrate a staged or gradualist solution to finding the right combination to open the lock. The probability of unlocking the combination in three separate phases falls to one in eighteen.\n\nIn this illustration, Dawkins identifies the role of sub-stages in Darwinian evolution. It is to increase the efficiency of mutation without affecting the probability of evolutionary success. The single stage requires 216, while the series of sub-stages requires only 18 non-random mutations at 100% probability of evolutionary success. That is an efficiency factor of 12 for mutations due to sub-staging without any change in probability. Similar efficiencies are achieved with random mutation without any change in probability.\n\nAfter addressing the claim by Fred Hoyle that probability alone could not produce the complexity of a typed text by Shakespeare, Dawkins introduces the notion of inherited improvements over a number of generations. Nature proceeds through small evolutionary steps,rather than large leaps. This idea is illustrated by a model of the ascent of Mount Improbable, which provides the title for this lecture.\n\nDawkins then illustrates the difference between the reproduction of inanimate phenomena, such as fires spread through sparks, with the inter-generational transmission of DNA in living structures. The gradual evolutionary adaption of these organisms is demonstrated through the examples of the eye, varieties of wings and protective camouflage.\n\nThe example of the gradual emergence of the eye is first shown: starting with a simple light sensitive flat surface and demonstrating the evolutionary benefits of a cone shaped proto-eye for detecting shadows and shapes. Dawkins then relates this model to the simple pinhole eye structure of a nautilus mollusc.\n\nThe benefit of wing structures is illustrated by way of body flattening behaviour in tree snakes, the web like skin of flying squirrels and similar adaptions to be found on flying lizards.\n\nDawkins begins by relating the story of asking a little girl \"what she thought flowers were 'for'.\" Her response is anthropocentric, that flowers are there for our benefit. Dawkins points out that many people throughout history have thought that the natural world existed for our benefit, with examples from Genesis and other literature. Author Douglas Adams, who is sitting in the audience, is called to read a relevant passage from his novel \"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\".\n\nDawkins then asks his audience to put off the idea that the natural world exists for our benefit. He considers the question of flowers seen through the eyes of bees and other pollinators, and performs a series of demonstrations which use ultraviolet light to excite fluorescence in various substances.\n\nDawkins opens by talking how organisms “grow up” to understand the universe around them, which requires certain apparatus, such as a brain. But before brains can become large enough to model the universe they must develop from intermediate forms. Dawkins then discusses the digger wasp and the set of experiments conducted by Nikolaas Tinbergen of how the digger wasp models the local geography around its nest. He then talks about the limitations of the digger wasps’ brain and concludes that only the human brain is sufficiently developed to model large-scale phenomena about the world. He then shows a MRI scan of a human brain (later revealed to be his own brain) and describes how an image develops from the eye onto the visual cortex.\n\nDawkins discusses how the image on the retina is upside-down and in two dimensions but the overlapping images from each of the eyes are composited to form a three-dimensional model in the brain. He shows this by asking the audience to focus on him while holding their hand at eye level which causes them to see two images of their hand; one from each eye. He then describes how using his finger to wriggle his eyeball that the outside world appears to move because he is moving the image on his retina. However this does not happen when he voluntary rolls his eyes from side to side. This is due to the brain using the internal model to compensate for the relative change in position of images on the retina. Dawkins gets someone to wear a virtual reality headset and move around in a 3-D computer generated world and draws an analogy between the model of the universe developed in one’s head with the virtual reality universe developed in the computer.\n\nHe then goes on the show that the brain uses models to describe the universe by looking at how the brain interprets various optical illusions, such as the hollow-face illusion using a rotating hollow mask of Charlie Chaplin, the \"impossible\" geometry of a Penrose triangle, the shifting interpretations of the Necker cube and the ability of humans to find faces in random shapes.\n\nDawkins then begins to discuss the evolution of the human brain. He shows an animation of the increasing skull size from \"Australopithecus\" to \"Homo habilis\" to \"Homo erectus\" and then finally to modern day humans.\n\nThe ability of a brain to run complex simulations is a powerful evolutionary advantage. Dawkins talks about how this ability to model future events by showing a painting suggesting a hypothetical situation in which a female \"Homo erectus\" uses a mental model of a tree fallen across a gorge as a possible solution to crossing the gorge. The group then burns a tree so that it would create a bridge over the gap. He goes on to describe how the complex modelling ability of the brain may have developed due to this imaginative simulation of various possible scenarios or by the development of language, which would allow ideas to be passed from generation to generation, or by technology, which is an extension of human hands and eyes; or, indeed, if it is a combination of all three.\n\nDawkins concludes that purpose has arisen in the Universe due to human brains. The simulations developed in our brain allow us to develop intent and purpose; and over time our collective understanding of the Universe will improve as we continue to study and exchange ideas.\n\n"}

The Canyon is both narrow and deep and has sides that are steep. Over its width it from at the rim it drops from depth to over deep at the thalweg.\n\nAlong a 350-km track, seismic profiles over Juan de Fuca Channel show the canyon consists of two distinct parts. The upper canyon is narrow, extends southwestward down the continental slope. This area has an average gradient of 17 meters per km. It is there carved in consolidated or semiconsolidated material of the slope.\n\nThe lower part of the channel trends northwestward, parallel to the shelf edge, with a gradient of only 7 meters per kilometer, terminating at the apex of Nitinat fan. The lower channel represents a small fan and valley feature. Further, Nitinat Fan was constructed on the deep-sea floor at what is the presently the terminus of Juan de Fuca Channel.\n\nMost of the shelf break canyons from Oregon and north cross only part of the continental shelf, and cut from the shelf break toward the coast. Then well below the mixed layer, they end on the continental shelf. Different from other aquatic canyons, the Juan de Fuca Channel, cuts the continental shelf and continues into the Strait of Juan de Fuca\n\nThe Juan de Fuca Channel reaches to the opening of the Juan de Fuca Strait, which separates the United States and Canada. The canyon is just less than wide and at least deep, that is, twice the depth of the surrounding seafloor.\n\nFor decades, it has been known that 20 to 30 times more deep water flows into Puget Sound than from all Earth's rivers combined, far bigger than the Amazon River. This flow is towards land, not away.\n\nNew (\"as of 2017\") measurements show this canyon may supply most the water coming into Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Canada’s Georgia Strait. The pattern of water circulation sends a dense lower layer of ocean water \"into\" towards land, while the upper layer flows \"out\" to sea.\n\nIn the range of 20 to 30 times more deep water flows into Puget Sound, than combined from all Earth's rivers. Tides seem be obvious, but play a minor role.\n\nJuan de Fuca Channel appears to be a pathway, bringing deep Pacific water into the Salish Sea.\n\nPuget Sound has famously rich water. There is reason for this.\n\nThe channel pulls nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean. Recent measurements (\"as of 2017\") may explain why this canyon helps support the Pacific Northwest’s inland waters support so many shellfish, salmon runs and even pods of whales.\n\nWater surges up the channel, mixing at surprisingly high rates.\n\nThe intense flow and mixing measured inside the Juan de Fuca Channel may help explain the formerly mysterious productivity of the shores of Washington. Coastal winds usually bring in some nutrients, but the numbers don’t add up.\n\n\"Washington is several times more productive – has more phytoplankton – than Oregon or California, and yet the winds here are several times weaker. That’s been kind of a puzzle, for years,\" observes Matthew Alford, an oceanographer with the University of Washington's Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nAt 500 feet below the surface, water has flowed as fast as s per second, showing mixing up to 1,000 times the normal rate in the deep ocean. The flow is hydraulically-controlled, which means it flows smoothly over a shallow ridge just off Cape Flattery then on the other side forms a turbulent breaking undersea wave, mixing with surface waters far above.\n\nThe deep water forced up through the channel happens to be rich in nutrients, which support the growth of marine plants, which then feed other marine life. The water is more acidic, and lower in oxygen, both of which contribute to water conditions in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.\n\n\"The location of this sill would be an outstanding place to fish,\" observes Matthew Alford, the oceanographer with the University of Washington’s Applied Physics Laboratory. \"People fish in Juan de Fuca Canyon pretty actively, and that’s probably no coincidence.\"\n\nAll of the following submarine canyons are near, headed north to south:\n\n\n\n"}

Coco de mer is endemic to the Seychelles islands of Praslin and Curieuse. Before the Seychelles were discovered and settled, nuts of this species were sometimes carried by the ocean currents to distant shores, such as those of the Maldives, where the tree was unknown. These floating nuts did not germinate. The exceptional size and suggestive form of the nut, the circumstances of its discovery, and some unusual qualities of the trees have given rise to several legends.\n\nThe nut of the coco de mer is very large (the largest seed in the plant kingdom) and is oddly shaped, being the shape and size of a woman's disembodied buttocks on one side, and a woman's belly and thighs on the other side. Not surprisingly, this nut was viewed by people in other parts of the world as a rare and fascinating object with mythological and even magical properties. The nature and origin of this extraordinary nut was mysterious, and the propagation of the tree was not understood. A number of legends arose both about the nuts, and about the trees that produce them.\n\nThe coco de mer palm has separate male and female trees, unlike the coconut palm. And, unlike the more familiar fruit of the coconut tree, the coco de mer fruit is not adapted to disperse naturally by floating on the ocean water. When a coco de mer fruit falls into the sea, it cannot float because of its great weight and density; instead it sinks to the bottom. However, after the fruit has been on the sea bed for a considerable period of time, the husk drops off, the internal parts of the nut decay, and the gases that form inside the nut cause the bare nut to rise up to the surface. At that time the nut can float, but is no longer fertile, thus when the ocean currents cause the nut to wash up on a distant beach, for example in the Maldives, a tree cannot, and does not, grow from the nut. The name coco de mer is French, and means \"coconut of the sea\".\n\nMalay seamen had seen coco de mer nuts \"falling upwards\" from the sea bed, and so they had reasoned that these nuts must grow on underwater trees, in a forest at the bottom of the Indian Ocean. According to Antonio Pigafetta and Georg Eberhard Rumphius, Malay people believed that the tree was also the home of the huge bird or bird-like creature Garuda (or Rukh of the Arabs). African priests believed that the Garuda was capable of hunting elephants and tigers. The African priests also believe that sometimes the coco de mer trees rose up above the ocean surface, and when this happened, the waves that the trees created did not allow any ship nearby to sail away and the helpless sailors were eaten by the Garuda. \nThe nuts that were found in the ocean and on the beaches no longer had a husk, and resembled the dismembered lower part of a woman's body, including the buttocks. This association is reflected in one of the plant's archaic botanical names, \"Lodoicea callipyge\" Comm. ex J. St.-Hil., in which \"callipyge\" is from the Greek words meaning \"beautiful rump\". Historically these floating \"beautiful rumps\" were collected and sold for a fortune in Arabia and in Europe.\n\nIn the Maldives, any coco de mer nuts that were found in the ocean or on the beaches were supposed to be given to the king, and keeping a nut for yourself or selling it could have resulted in the death penalty. However, Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor was able to purchase one of these nuts for 4,000 gold florins. The Dutch Admiral Wolfert Hermanssen also received a nut as a gift for his services, from the Sultan of Bantam in 1602, for fighting the Portuguese and protecting the capital of Bantam. However, the nut that the admiral was given was missing the top part; apparently the Sultan had ordered the top of the nut to be cut off, in order not to upset the noble admiral’s modesty. João de Barros believed that coco de mer possessed amazing healing powers, superior even to those of \"the precious stone Bezoar\". In one of his books, Dr. Berthold Carl Seemann mentioned that many believed the nuts to be an antidote to all poisons. The nuts were praised not only by scientists and botanists, but also by poets. Luís de Camões wrote: \nIn 1769, Jean Duchemin sailed to Praslin, the second largest island in the Seychelles, on the ship \"L’Heureuse Marie\". He loaded up with a cargo of these unusual nuts, which he later sold in Indian markets. After his trip, coco de mer nuts never again held the same extraordinary value.\n\nNew legends about the coco de mer came into existence after 1743, when the real coco de mer trees were discovered. Fruits of coco de mer are developed only on female trees. Male trees have long phallic-looking catkins. Because of these unusual, erotic shapes, some people believed that the trees made passionate love on stormy nights. According to the legend, male trees uproot themselves, and approach female trees. Apparently the love-making trees are rather shy, and the legend has it that whoever sees the trees mating will die or go blind. The fact that even now the pollination of the coco de mer is not fully understood, is one of the factors behind the legend.\n\nIn the Victorian era, General Charles George Gordon, who visited the Seychelles in 1881, believed that the Vallée de Mai on the island of Praslin was the original Garden of Eden as described in the Bible, and that the coco de mer was the forbidden fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. General Gordon wrote:\n\nIt occurred to at least some of Gordon's readers that if coco de mer was really the forbidden fruit, Eve would have had a very hard time handing this gigantic fruit (which weighs 15–30 kg) to Adam.\n"}

These 50 peaks are also the highest mountains of Australasia, where, outside New Guinea, the highest mountain is Aoraki / Mount Cook in New Zealand with a height of 3724 m. A list of highest mountains of Oceania with the same limitations is almost identical, with the addition of the Hawaiian volcanoes of Mauna Kea (4205 m) and Mauna Loa (4169 m) in 18th and 20th positions. The list also shows the 36 highest thus defined mountains of Indonesia, except for the 3805 m high Gunung Kerinci on Sumatra (#29 in Indonesia), and the 16 highest mountains of Papua New Guinea.\n\nMany mountains in New Guinea are poorly surveyed and some major summits remain unnamed on maps. \nEven well measured mountains have conflicting heights on otherwise authoritative maps. For example, the highest point in Oceania, Carstensz Pyramid, was established to be 4884 m in 1973 when an Australian survey expedition put a beacon on the summit. This corresponded closely to the 4866 m estimate by the first Lorentsz Expedition in 1910 using repeated theodolite observations from the south coast. However, over time the mountain had grown in stature: measurements from northern observation peaks for the highest summit (each time Ngga Pulu) were 5000 m in 1910 by Ludolph Doorman and 5030 m in 1926 by Charles C.F.M. Le Roux. The 1936 Carstensz Expedition using barometric and boiling point measurements on the summit of Ngga Pulu also derived an elevation of 5030 m. After ascending the Pyramid in 1962, Heinrich Harrer even estimated that peak to be 17,096 feet or 5211 m high. The 1973 survey established that the 1936 barometric estimates were consistently between 118 and 127 m too high. Nevertheless, the 5030 m height is still prevalent in most atlases and maps.\n\nAll mountains in West Papua are in the Maoke Mountains, a translation of the name “Sneeuwgebergte” or Snowy Mountains endowed to them in 1623 by Jan Carstensz, at which time many of the peaks indeed were covered by extensive ice caps. By the beginning of the 20th century, at least five such glaciated regions remained on the highest mountains. In 1913, the 4520–4550 m high Prins Hendrik-top (now Puncak Yamin) was named and reported to have some \"eternal\" snow. The ice cap of Wilhelmina Peaks vanished between 1939 and 1963, while the Mandala / Juliana ice cap disappeared in the 1990s. The Idenburg glacier on Ngga Pilimsit dried up in 2003, leaving currently only the remnants of the glaciers on Mount Carstensz, the last of which are expected to disappear before 2050 and perhaps much earlier. The snow melt on the last mountain has caused a change of the highest summit of New Guinea: somewhere between 1936 and 1973 the title of highest summit of Oceania changed from Ngga Pulu, the highest point of the \"Northwall Firn\" (by then split into the West and East Northwall Firn; only small patches of the latter still exist), to the rocky spires of Carstensz Pyramid 3 km to its south-west.\n\nThe list contains some unranked summits that are either of general interest, may show topographic prominences of >500 m given better data, or are more than 12 km isolated from any higher point.\n"}

In 2016, 93% of the global PV cell manufacturing capacity utilizes crystalline silicon (cSi) technology, representing a commanding lead over rival forms of PV technology, such as cadmium telluride (CdTe), amorphous silicon (aSi), and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). In 2016, manufacturers in China and Taiwan met the majority of global PV module demand, accounting for 68% of all modules, followed by the rest of Asia at 14%. The United States and Canada manufactured 6%, and Europe manufactured a mere 4%.\n\nPhotovoltaics companies include PV capital equipment producers, cell manufacturers, panel manufacturers and installers. The list does not include silicon manufacturing companies.\n\nAccording to EnergyTrend, the 2011 global top ten polysilicon, solar cell and solar module manufacturers by capacity were found in countries including People's Republic of China, United States, Taiwan, Germany, Japan, and Korea.\n\nIn 2011, the global top ten polysilicon makers by capacity were GCL, Hemlock, OCI, Wacker, LDK, REC, MEMC/SunEdison, Tokuyama, LCY and Woongjin, represented by People's Republic of China, United States, Taiwan, Germany, Japan and South Korea.\n\nYearly ranking\n\nTop 10 solar module producers\n\nIn 2015, GCL System Integration Technology Company made an increase of 500%, topping 2.5-2.7 GW, which puts it at seventh rank, overtaking Yingli Green, compared to 0.5 GW in 2014. Their solar PV module production appears to have reached a 3.7 GW capacity at the end of 2015.\n\nSolar modules, as the final products to be installed to generate electricity, are regarded as the major components to be selected by customers willing to choose solar PV energy. Solar module manufacturers must be sure that their products can be sustainable for application periods of more than 25 years. As a result, major solar module producers have their products tested by publicly recognized testing organizations and guarantee their durable efficiency rate for a certain number of years. The solar PV market has been growing for the past few years. According to solar PV research company PVinsights, worldwide shipments of solar modules in 2011 was around 25 GW, and the shipment year-over-year growth was around 40%. The top five solar module producers in 2011 were: Suntech, First Solar, Yingli, Trina, and Canadian. The top five solar module companies possessed 51.3% market share of solar modules, according to PVinsights' market intelligence report.\n\nTop 10 solar cell producers\n\nAccording to an annual market survey by the photovoltaics trade publication \"Photon International\", global production of photovoltaic cells and modules in 2009 was 12.3 GW. The top ten manufacturers accounted for 45% of this total. \nIn 2010, a tremendous growth of solar PV cell shipments doubled the solar PV cell market size. According to the solar PV market research company PVinsights, Suntech topped the ranking of solar cell production. Most of the top ten solar PV producers doubled their shipment in 2010 and five of them were over one gigawatt shipments. The top ten solar cell producers dominated the market with an even higher market share, say 50~60%, with respect to an assumed twenty gigawatt cell shipments in 2010.\n\nQuarterly ranking\n\nAlthough yearly ranking is as listed above, quarterly ranking can indicate which company can sustain particular conditions such as severet price adjustment, government feed-in tariff change, and weather conditions. In 2Q11, First Solar regained the top spot in solar module shipments from Suntech. From the 2Q11 results, four phenomena should be noticed: thin film leader First Solar still dominates; more centralization in the solar module market; Chinese companies soared; and the giga-watt game is prevailing (according to the latest solar model shipment report by PVinsigts).\n\nThin film ranking\n\nThin film solar cells are commercially used in several technologies, including cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), and amorphous and other thin-film silicon (a-Si, TF-Si). In 2013, thin-film declined to 9% of worldwide PV production.\n\nIn 2009, thin films represented 16.8% of total global production, up from 12.5% in 2008.

Its production has been rapidly escalating. In 2001 it had less than 1% of the world market. In contrast, in 2001 Japan and the United States combined had over 70% of world production. By 2011 they produced around 15%.\n\nOther notable companies include:\n\nBelow is a list of solar panel factories. It lists actual factories only, former plants are below this first table. \n"}

In 1770, he became a member of the Academy and went to Italy on its behalf. Once there, he turned to landscape painting, which proved to be his true forté. \n\nHe is best known for the paintings he produced during a stay in Naples. Mount Vesuvius was especially active at that time, and he took the opportunity to capture close-up scenes of the eruptions and lava flows. Accompanied by the English diplomat and volcanologist, Sir William Hamilton, he even made risky trips close to the volcano's crater. Until the advent of photography, his paintings were considered to be the most scientifically accurate representations of a volcanic eruption.\n\nHe later spent some time painting the ruins in Rome, then returned to Vienna, where he became a Professor at the Academy. He revisited Italy for a short time in 1805, to collect new material.

{"id": "998579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=998579", "title": "Mopane", "text": "Mopane\n\nColophospermum mopane, commonly called mopane, mophane, mopani, balsam tree, butterfly tree, or turpentine tree, is a tree in the legume family (Fabaceae), that grows in hot, dry, low-lying areas, in elevation, in the far northern parts of southern Africa. The tree only occurs in Africa and is the only species in genus \"Colophospermum\". Its distinctive butterfly-shaped (bifoliate) leaf and thin seed pod make it easy to identify. In terms of human use it is, together with camel thorn and leadwood, one of the three regionally important firewood trees.\n\nIt is native to Angola and Malawi. It is found growing in alkaline (high lime content) soils which are shallow and not well drained. It also grows in alluvial soils (soil deposited by rivers). In small portions of South Africa and larger adjacent areas of Botswana and Zimbabwe, the trees tend to vary between , often called \"mopane scrub\" (shrub) but also sometimes taller and forming woodland, where further north the trees are taller and form tall woodlands referred to as cathedral mopane. This tree does not grow well outside hot, frost-free areas with summer rainfall.\n\nThere are two ecoregions where mopane is the predominant vegetation. The Angolan Mopane woodlands are in southwestern Angola and northern Namibia, and the Zambezian and mopane woodlands extend over the lowlands of the Zambezi River and its tributaries in Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, South Africa, and Swaziland.\n\nMopane wood is one of southern Africa's heaviest and is difficult to work because of its hardness. However, this also makes it termite resistant. For this reason it has long been used for building houses and fences, as railway sleepers and as pit props. The termite-resistance and rich, reddish colouring also make it popular for flooring. Outside Africa, mopane is gaining popularity as a heavy, decorative wood, its uses including aquarium ornaments, bases for lamps or sculptures, and garden accents.\nIt is also increasingly being used in the construction of musical instruments, particularly woodwind. Suitable quality African blackwood (\"Dalbergia melanoxylon\"), traditionally used for clarinets, is becoming harder to find. Mopane is fairly oily, seasons very well with few splits or shakes, and produces instruments of a warm, rich tone.\n\nMopane twigs have been traditionally used as tooth brushes, bark to make twine and for tanning, and leaves for healing wounds. The wood is also used to make charcoal and for braai wood.\n\nThe tree is a major food source for the mopane worm, the caterpillar of the moth \"Gonimbrasia belina\". The caterpillars are rich in protein and are eaten by people. The tree also acts as a foodplant for a wild silk moth, \"Gonometa rufobrunnea\". Cocoons of the moth are harvested as wild silk, to make cloth.\n\nThe mopane tree also serves as a host plant for the mopane psyllid \"Retroacizzia mopani\".\n\n\"Colophospermum\" is Latinised Greek for \"oily seed\", in reference to the resinous seed (i.e. \"spermum\") which has a turpentine smell. Colophon was the birthplace of Homer in Ionia, and was famous for its rosin, a substance obtained from turpentine or the gummy exudate of some trees. The species name \"mopane\" is taken from the local name for the tree.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1676253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1676253", "title": "Natural history of Trinidad and Tobago", "text": "Natural history of Trinidad and Tobago\n\nTrinidad and Tobago are continental islands with a geologically very recent history of direct land bridge connection to South America. As a result, unlike most of the Caribbean Islands, Trinidad and Tobago supports a primarily South American flora and fauna and has greater diversity of plant and animal species than the Antilles. However, rates of endemism are lower than in the rest of the Caribbean because there has been less time for genetic isolation from mainland populations because of the history of land bridge connections and hence fewer opportunities for speciation, and so a greater proportion of the species in Trinidad and Tobago are also found on the South American mainland. Trinidad is nearer to mainland South America and has been directly connected to the mainland via land bridges more often and for longer periods than Tobago. This, as well as Trinidad's larger size and more varied topography and hydrology compared to that of Tobago allow greater species and ecosystem diversity on the former compared to that on the later of the islands.\n\nThe standard description of plant communities follows John Beard's work (Beard, 1946). He classified natural vegetation in a hierarchical fashion on the basis of the physiognomy of the dominant trees.\n\n\nTrinidad and Tobago is home to about 99 species of terrestrial mammals. About 65 of the mammalian species in the islands are bats (including cave roosting, tree and cavity roosting bats and even foliage-tent-making bats; all with widely differing diets from nectar and fruit, to insects, small vertebrates such as fish, frogs, small birds and rodents and even those that consume vertebrate blood). The next most diverse group of mammals in the islands are the rodents. The largest of these rodents are the lowland paca, the Brazilian porcupine, and the red-rumped agouti (of these, only the agouti remains extant on Tobago). One squirrel (the red-tailed squirrel) and several native rats and mice are also part of the rodent fauna. A few species of opossums including the common opossum may be found on both islands. Two anteaters, the southern tamandua and the silky anteater are found in Trinidad (but not in Tobago). The nine-banded armadillo can still be found on both islands. Native mammals of the order Carnivora include the ocelot, the tayra, the Neotropical river otter and the crab-eating raccoon (all four being found on Trinidad, with only the raccoon still extant on Tobago). The small Asian mongoose was introduced to Trinidad (but not to Tobago) during the later part of the 19th century and is now naturalized. The two native hoofed-mammals still found in Trinidad include the red brocket deer and the collared peccary (in Tobago, the deer is thought to be extirpated and the peccary is now fairly rare). The red howler monkey and the white-fronted capuchin are Trinidad's two native non-human primate species. The tufted capuchin monkey was introduced to the northwestern peninsula of Trinidad during World War II and is now naturalized there. No monkeys remain extant on Tobago. For comments on native aquatic mammals (namely manatees) and native marine mammals (whales and dolphins), see the appropriate sections below.\n\n472 species of birds have been recorded in Trinidad and Tobago (and the list of recorded species seems be still slowly increasing from year to year). There are few places in the world where so many birds can be seen in such a small area (with probably one of the highest bird species to area ratios of any country). Many of the species are very rare or are of particular interest. They range from the many species of hummingbirds to the primitive cave-dwelling oilbird (that uses sonar to fly in the dark) to the spectacularly beautiful scarlet ibis. The islands are within a few miles of Venezuela, and the species are therefore typical of tropical South America. However, the variety (although quite exceptional for such a small geographic area) is somewhat impoverished compared to the mainland, as would be expected with small islands.\n\nThe resident breeding birds are augmented in the northern winter by migrants from North America.\n\nTobago has only about half the number of bird species of Trinidad, but about 22 birds have been reported only from Tobago, including 12 breeding species.\n\nThe country hosts a few endemic avian subspecies and two endemic species (the critically endangered Trinidad Piping Guan found only in Trinidad, and the Trinidad Motmot found on both islands, but more common in Tobago).\n\nThe best sources of information regarding the recorded amphibians and reptiles of Trinidad and Tobago to date are Murphy (1997) and Boos (2001). Since those publications, a few new records as well as several taxonomic changes have been made (Murphy and Downie, 2012). The herpetofaunal list is at present in a state of flux, as taxonomy and systematics continue to be revised. To date (July 2014), the generally accepted recorded numbers of species of the various major groups of amphibians and reptiles are as follows:\n\nFrogs and toads (Anura): 37 species in total for the country. (33 recorded from Trinidad and 15 recorded on Tobago, with 4 of those from Tobago not known from Trinidad, and 2 of those from Trinidad known from just one specimen each. There is one introduced species, known on both Trinidad and Tobago).\n\nCaecilians (Gymnophonia): 1 species in total from Trinidad only. (Recorded from only 1 specimen).\n\nTurtles, terrapins and tortoises (Chelonii): 14 species recorded in total for the country (All 14 recorded for Trinidad, and possibly 6 recorded for Tobago. Four species are marine, with at least 4 being noted off Tobago, with at least 3 of those regularly breeding on both islands. Four are confirmed native terrestrial system species of Trinidad (1 of these is possibly a waif on Tobago). One is possibly a long introduced species on both islands that is still present in the wild in some areas of Trinidad, but unconfirmed in the wild in Tobago. One is very recently introduced in Trinidad from North America and it is unconfirmed if it is breeding in the wild. Three are possibly occasional waifs to Trinidad from the nearby continent with no verified local breeding populations).\n\nCrocodiles and alligators (Crocodylia): 4 species recorded in total for the country (two are known to be native and breeding on Trinidad, with one of those breeding in Tobago, while the other 2 were occasionally historically recorded as waifs).\n\nLegless lizards (Amphisbaenia): 2 species from Trinidad only.\n\nLizards (Sauria): 31 confirmed records for the country in total (2 of those not yet 'officially' documented). (Of the 31 confirmed records, 27 are from Trinidad, with at least 7 relatively recent historical introductions with 1 of these subsequently assumed to have been extirpated. Nineteen are from Tobago, with at least 3 relatively recent historical introductions there. Four of those from Tobago are not found on Trinidad. In addition to the 31 confirmed records, there are at least 3 species records that are dubious). \n\nSnakes (Serpentes): 50 accepted records for the country in total (1 of these not yet 'officially' documented). (Of these 50 records, 45 are from Trinidad and 22 are from Tobago, with 5 of those from Tobago not being recorded from Trinidad. Of the 50 records for the country, 7 species are known from just 1 or 2 records. In addition to the 50 generally accepted confirmed records, there are at least 2 dubious records).\n\nA number of frogs and toads inhabit the islands, including the well known huge marine or cane toad (\"Rhinella marina\") locally known as the crapaud (pronounced crah-poh) on both islands, and the tiny colourful rare endemic species known as the El Tucuche golden tree frog (\"Phytotriades auratus\") found only in the giant epiphitic bromeliads at the mist-shrouded summits of Trinidad's two highest peaks. The strangest of all Trinidad's frogs is the highly aquatic Suriname toad or pipa toad (\"Pipa pipa\"), the tadpoles of which develop in the skin tissue of the mother's back, before bursting out and emerging as miniature replicas of the adult frogs. The giant tree frog (\"Hypsiboas boans\") known locally as the giant flying frog is commonly heard calling after dusk from the vegetation along forest-lined streams in Trinidad. The two frog species of the genus \"Mannophryne\" found diurnally active in forests along fast flowing mountain streams (one of which is endemic to Trinidad and the other endemic to Tobago) both demonstrate a degree of parental care as the tadpoles are transported on the backs of the adult males before a suitable fairly predator-free body of water is found where they may be left to develop. The relatively recently introduced Grenadian 'tink' frog (\"Eleutherodactylus johnstonei\") can be heard at night in loud metallic 'tinking' choruses in urban residential neighbourhood yards and parks from Diego Martin to Sangre Grande in Trinidad, and more recently in southwestern Tobago. The tungara frog or locally called the \"pung-la-la\" (\"Engystomops pustulosus\") is commonly heard at night calling from wet grassy ditches in open habitats in both urban and rural areas on both islands and their foam nests are found even in small road and trail side puddles during the rainy season. The southwestern peninsula of Trinidad is home to a rather diverse community of frogs, with at least one (\"Leptodactylus nesiotus\") being known only from that area (an endemic). Trinidad may also be home to a caecilian (\"Typhlonectes\" species) (a legless highly aquatic amphibian with an eel-like body that is rarely observed due to its habitat specifications) although only one specimen has ever been scientifically documented from Trinidad.\n\nTerrapins, tortoises and marine turtles make their homes on and around these islands. The giant leatherback sea turtle (\"Dermochelys coriacea\"), the hawksbill turtle (\"Eretmochelys imbricata\"), the loggerhead turtle (\"Caretta caretta\"), the olive ridley turtle (\"Lepidochelys olivacea\") and the green sea turtle (\"Chelonia mydas\") are marine species that either nest on the islands' beaches or frequent their coastal waters. The land dwelling yellow-footed tortoise (\"Geochelone denticulata\") or Morrocoy as it is locally known is threatened by high levels of poaching in Trinidad. The odd mata-mata turtle (\"Chelus fimbriata\") is known as a waif (and is possibly a rare inhabitant) of the Nariva Swamp and other southern and eastern coastal river systems in Trinidad. The wood-turtle locally known as the Galap (\"Rhinoclemmys punctularia\") is found in and near rivers, streams and swamps in Trinidad, and has appeared on occasion as a waif on Tobago. \n\nAll the marine turtle species are threatened by illegal hunting activity and as the bycatch of gillnet fishing. Never-the-less there has been great success achieved by measures taken to educate the public and ensure species conservation since the 1970s. Beaches on Trinidad's northern and eastern coasts are noted among the top 3 internationally most important nesting grounds for leatherback sea turtles and a few community run conservation organizations help to maintain the nesting habitats, deter poaching and to bring sustainable revenue generated via ecotourism into their communities.\n\nThe spectacled caiman (\"Caiman crocodilus\") which may grow up to a maximum of about in length, but are usually somewhat smaller are to be found throughout both islands in slow moving freshwater (including reservoirs) or brackish water along the coasts. They are shy creatures and pose no real threat to humans unless intentionally provoked or approached while nesting. It is generally considered that the few records of both the American crocodile (\"Crocodylus acutus\") as well as the Orinoco crocodile (\"Crocodylus intermedius\") in the waters and on the coasts of Trinidad and Tobago were, for the most part, waifs from mainland South America.\n\nThere are two species of legless lizards \"Amphisbaena alba\" and \"Amphisbaena fuliginosa\" known as 'two headed' snakes on Trinidad. They spend much of their lives burrowing in the soil in forest or forest-edge areas and are often associated with the nests of leaf-cutter ants \"Atta\", which form part of their diet.\n\nThere are a number of lizards ranging in size from just over an inch or two in length to the huge long green iguana (\"Iguana iguana\"). The so-called luminous lizard (\"Riama shrevei\") makes its home in primary lower montane and montane forest at the mouths of caves and cool stream banks on the high peaks, ridges and high valleys of the Northern Range of Trinidad and is found nowhere else on earth. Found in forest, forest edge and savanna habitats, the large tegu (\"Tupinambis teguixin\") or matte/salipenta as it is locally called and the green iguana (still fairly common, even in some sub-urban areas) are considered delicacies on both Trinidad and Tobago. A number of anole species (\"Anolis\") may be easily observed, even in suburban areas. Only \"Anolis chrysolepis\" is a Trinidad native, with all other anoles being relatively recently or historically introduced. Other common lizards include macro-teiids (or whip-tailed lizards) such as the \"Ameiva atrigularis\" (locally called the zandolie or ground lizard and common even in suburban gardens) and \"Cnemidophorus lemniscatus\" (most readily seen along some coastal areas of southwestern Tobago and on Trinidad's east and south coasts and on the islands of Chacachacare, Huevos, Little Tobago and Goat Island). Nocturnally active geckos of the genera \"Thecadactylus\" and \"Hemidactylus\" are common in old and rural buildings on both islands and are commonly referred to as mabouias and wood slaves respectively. There are a number of small colourful diurnal geckos of the genus \"Gonatodes\" present. One of them, \"Gonatodes ocellatus\" is endemic to forests and edge habitats of northeastern Tobago while another, \"Gonatodes vittatus\" or the streak lizard as it is locally known, is very common and can be seen in most suburban and even urban backyards in Trinidad (and is probably relatively recently introduced to some parts Tobago associated with human occupation). The tiny Mole's gecko \"Sphaerodactylus molei\" is found on both islands and is among the smallest of lizards in the world.\n\nIncluded among the country's snake fauna are some of the very smallest in the world (the fossorial thread snakes in the genus \"Epictia\" and other blind snakes), to the very largest of snakes in the world (the green anaconda). Anacondas (locally called the huille) have been historically found around streams, rivers and swamps in southern and eastern Trinidad, and recently also in the Caroni River drainage system. They have not been reported from Tobago. Three other boas, namely \"Boa constrictor\" (locally called the macajuel), \"Corallus ruschenbergerii\" (a tree boa locally called the cascabel dormilon) and \"Epicrates maurus\" (a rainbow boa) are found in forest and forest edge habitats throughout both islands (with the last even being common in some urban areas). Several harmless snakes in the subfamilies Colubrinae and Dipsadinae are found throughout the islands. Some of the larger examples of the diurnal Colubrinae include \"Spilotes pullatus\" (locally called the tigre in Trinidad and the black snake in Tobago) found in forest and forest edge habitats, and the rarer more forest dwelling \"Drymarchon corais\" (or yellow-tailed cribo) can be found on both islands. Smaller well known members of the subfamily include the machete couesse (\"Mastigodryas boddaerti\" on Trinidad, and \"Mastigodryas dunni\" endemic to Tobago) and the horsewhip (\"Oxybelis aeneus\") and are common in forest and forest edge habitats, even in some suburban areas of both islands. Among the Colubrinae, the loras \"Leptophis stimsoni\" and \"Leptophis haileyi\" are endemics to Trinidad's Northern Range and Tobago's Main Ridge respectively. Many of the members of the subfamily Dipsadinae are typically nocturnal and some of the more commonly observed species present even in suburban areas on both islands are the false mapipire (\"Leptodeira annulata ashmeadi\") and the slug-eating snake (\"Sibon nebulata\"). Other interesting Dipsadinae include the water mapipire (\"Helicops angulatus\") a habitat specialist of freshwater and brackish water systems of lowland Trinidad, the mainly diurnal beh belle chemin (\"Erythrolamprus melanotus nesos\") of forest and edge habitats on both islands and the rare crepuscular red snake (\"Erythrolamprus ocellatus\") endemic to the forest and edge habitats of northeastern Tobago. There are no dangerous venomous snakes on Tobago. There are only four dangerous venomous snakes on Trinidad. These include two vipers, and two coral snakes. The vipers (the true mapipires) are the mapipire balsain (\"Bothrops\" cf. \"atrox\") and the mapipire zanana (\"Lachesis muta muta\"). The former is fairly common in primary and secondary forested areas of Trinidad (particularly so in the Northern Range), and the later is a very rarely encountered primary rainforest specialist in Trinidad. The two coral snakes are the small coral snake (\"Micrurus circinalis\", and the large coral snake (\"Micrurus lemniscatus diutius\"), both associated with forested areas, and the later sometimes being associated with swampy habitats in Trinidad.\n\nFatal venomous snake bite accidents in Trinidad are fairly uncommon. It is unfortunate to note that although all snakes (with the exception of the potentially dangerous vipers and corals) are protected by law in Trinidad and Tobago, the human population at large is not generally tolerant of snakes, and even harmless snakes found near human dwellings, farms and gardens are often killed on sight. More public awareness is needed to dispel misconceptions about snakes as well as to sensitize the population to the ecological importance of snakes.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago are extremely rich in neotropical invertebrate fauna. Several hundred species of butterflies, including the brilliant blue emperor butterfly (\"Morpho peleides\"), and beetles are to be found on the islands, many in the tropical forests. Barcant (1970) lists 617 species of butterfly for the two islands of which 123 occur on Tobago. The leaf cutter ant (\"Atta\") is easily observed, even in sub-urban environments. Soldier ants may be observed in forested areas. The largest specimens of centipedes (genus \"Scolopendra\")(over long) may be found particularly in the drier forests of the Northwestern Peninsular of Trinidad (the Chaguaramas Peninsular) as well as the nearby tiny off shore islands. A few species of large tarantulas may be found in forested areas and even in houses at the forest edge. The arthropod life of Trinidad and Tobago has not been well studied and it is an entomologist's paradise waiting to be discovered, with many species remaining undocumented.\n\nThere are approximately 70 species of land snails ranging in size from the giant South American land snail (\"Megalobulimus oblongus\") to the tiny Gastrocopta snails.\n\nMany species of crustaceans (terrestrial, freshwater and marine) are among the other invertebrates that may be easily observed in Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nThere are nine species of scorpions in Trinidad and Tobago including the medically important \"Tityus trinitatis\".\n\nThere are a number of wetland habitats on both Trinidad and Tobago that foster vital aquatic ecosystems.\n\nThe Bon Accord Lagoon on Tobago is a vital mangrove habitat and home to a population of spectacled caimans as well as a number of wetland bird species.\n\nThe Caroni Swamp on the west coast of Trinidad has a fairly high level of salinity (compared to other major wetlands on the island) and is an important breeding and feeding habitat for several bird species (including magnificent flocks of scarlet ibis (one of the National Birds)) and several marine fishes and invertebrates.\n\nThe Nariva Swamp of the east coast is the largest freshwater swamp on Trinidad and has a Ramsar Convention status of wetland of international importance. It and its associated river system of canals and rivers is home to a vast array of aquatic life, including a very small population of the highly endangered West Indian manatee, the green anaconda, the spectacled caiman, the mata mata turtle and the common Suriname toad. The plant community in the swamp include various mangroves, moriche palms and bloodwood trees.\n\nThere are many small rivers and streams throughout the islands. Over 40 species of freshwater fish have been recorded in Trinidad and Tobago. The world-famous guppy is a common native fish; particularly so in the mountain streams of Trinidad, where it has served as a model organism for several important ecological and evolutionary studies.\n\nTrinidad's western and southern coastal waters are highly influenced by the outflow of freshwater from the adjacent Orinoco River of Venezuela which is less than away from Trinidad at the closest point. As such, the waters here are fairly low in salinity and high in sediment/nutrient content and relatively shallow. These facts coupled with the highly sheltered nature of the Gulf of Paria and the Columbus Channel respectively, create ideal breeding/spawning grounds for many marine fishes and invertebrates, including shrimp.\n\nVarious 'sporting' fish are present in the waters of both islands and include huge grouper, marlin, barracuda and dolphin-fish. Fish popularly caught and eaten include carite, kingfish and red snapper.\n\nAs mentioned in the section above on the reptilian fauna of Trinidad and Tobago, a number of species of marine turtles including the leatherback turtle, hawksbill turtle, loggerhead turtle, olive ridley turtle and green sea turtle frequent the waters around and/or nest on some of the beaches of both islands.\n\nWhales and dolphins were far more common to Trinidad and Tobago's waters in earlier times, but the very rigorous whaling industry of the 19th century decimated the population of whales in the Gulf of Paria (called 'Golfo de Balena' or Gulf of Whales by Christopher Columbus). Today, dolphins may still be regularly observed, particularly off the shore of the northwestern Chaguaramas peninsula. Pilot whales have been observed to beach themselves on a few occasions during the 1990s and a small pod of killer whales were caught in a fisherman's net during the 1980s. \"See also: List of mammals of Trinidad and Tobago\"\n\nWhale sharks (the largest of all fishes) have been observed around the oil rigs in the southern part of the Gulf of Paria. Hammerhead sharks are commonly caught by fishermen and shark flesh is unfortunately considered a delicacy among the human population of both islands.\n\nThe waters of Tobago are less affected by the outflow of fresh water from the Orinoco and as such are far more saline and clearer than that of Trinidad. A number of coral reefs are thus able to exist around Tobago, the most famous being the Buccoo Reef. Tobago's reefs are reputedly home to the largest examples of brain coral. Also present are huge and gentle manta rays, impressive moray eels, parrot fish, angel fish and a host of other colourful tropical coral reef species.\n\n"}

{"id": "52634071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52634071", "title": "Nature-based solutions", "text": "Nature-based solutions\n\nNature-based solutions (NBS or NbS) refers to the sustainable management and use of nature for tackling socio-environmental challenges. The challenges include issues such as climate change, water security, water pollution, food security, human health, and disaster risk management. \n\nA definition by the European Union states that these solutions are \"inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. The Nature-based Solutions Initiative meanwhile defines them as \"actions that work with and enhance nature so as to help people adapt to change and disasters\". Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions\". With NBS, healthy, resilient and diverse ecosystems (whether natural, managed or newly created) can provide solutions for the benefit of societies and overall biodiversity.\n\nFor instance, the restoration or protection of mangroves along coastlines utilizes a nature-based solution to accomplish several things. Mangroves moderate the impact of waves and wind on coastal settlements or cities and sequester CO . They also provide safe nurseries for marine life that can be the basis for sustaining populations of fish that local populations may depend on. Additionally, the mangrove forests can help control coastal erosion resulting from sea level rise. Similarly, in cities green roofs or walls are nature-based solutions that can be used to moderate the impact of high temperatures, capture storm water, abate pollution, and act as carbon sinks, while enhancing biodiversity.\n\nConservation approaches and environment management initiatives have been carried out for decades. What is new is that the benefits of such nature-based solutions to human well-being have been articulated well more recently. Even if the term itself is still being framed, examples of nature-based solutions can be found all over the world, and imitated. Nature-based solutions are on their way to being mainstreamed in national and international policies and programmes (e.g. climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms). For example, the theme for World Water Day 2018 was \"Nature for water\" and by UN-Water's accompanying UN World Water Development Report had the title \"Nature-based Solutions for Water\".\n\nSocieties increasingly face challenges such as climate change, urbanization, jeopardized food security and water resource provision, and disaster risk. One approach to answer these challenges is to singularly rely on technological strategies. An alternative approach is to manage the (socio-)ecological systems in a comprehensive way in order to sustain and potentially increase the delivery of ecosystem services to humans. In this context, nature-based solutions (NBS) have recently been put forward by practitioners and quickly thereafter by policymakers. These solutions stress the sustainable use of nature in solving coupled environmental-social-economic challenges. \n\nWhile ecosystem services are often valued in terms of immediate benefits to human well-being and economy, NBS focus on the benefits to people and the environment itself, to allow for sustainable solutions that are able to respond to environmental change and hazards in the long-term. NBS go beyond the traditional biodiversity conservation and management principles by \"re-focusing\" the debate on humans and specifically integrating societal factors such as human well-being and poverty reduction, socio-economic development, and governance principles. \n\nWith respect to water issues, NBS can achieve the following, according to the World Water Development Report 2018 by UN-Water: \n\nIn this sense, NBS are strongly connected to ideas such as natural systems agriculture, natural solutions, ecosystem-based approaches, adaptation services, natural infrastructure, green infrastructure and ecological engineering. For instance, ecosystem-based approaches are increasingly promoted for climate change adaptation and mitigation by organisations like United Nations Environment Programme and non-governmental organisations such as The Nature Conservancy. These organisations refer to \"policies and measures that take into account the role of ecosystem services in reducing the vulnerability of society to climate change, in a multi-sectoral and multi-scale approach\".\n\nLikewise, natural infrastructure is defined as a \"strategically planned and managed network of natural lands, such as forests and wetlands, working landscapes, and other open spaces that conserves or enhances ecosystem values and functions and provides associated benefits to human populations\"; and green infrastructure refers to an \"interconnected network of green spaces that conserves natural systems and provides assorted benefits to human populations\".\n\nSimilarly, the concept of ecological engineering generally refers to \"protecting, restoring (i.e. ecosystem restoration) or modifying ecological systems to increase the quantity, quality and sustainability of particular services they provide, or to build new ecological systems that provide services that would otherwise be provided through more conventional engineering, based on non-renewable resources\".\n\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) defines NBS as actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits, with climate change, food security, disaster risks, water security, social and economic development as well as human health being the common societal challenges.\n\nIUCN proposes to consider NBS as an umbrella concept. Categories and examples of NBS approaches according to IUCN include:\n\nThe general objective of NBS is clear, namely the sustainable management and use of nature for tackling societal challenges. However, different stakeholders view NBS from other perspectives. For instance, IUCN defines NBS as \"actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits\". This framing puts the need for well-managed and restored ecosystems at the heart of NBS, with the overarching goal of \"Supporting the achievement of society's development goals and safeguard human well-being in ways that reflect cultural and societal values and enhance the resilience of ecosystems, their capacity for renewal and the provision of services\". \n\nIn the context of the ongoing political debate on jobs and growth (main drivers of the current EU policy agenda), the European Commission underlines that NBS can transform environmental and societal challenges into innovation opportunities, by turning natural capital into a source for green growth and sustainable development. In their view, NBS to societal challenges are \"solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions.\" \n\nThis framing is somewhat broader, and puts economy and social assets at the heart of NBS as importantly as sustaining environmental conditions. It shares similarities with the definition proposed by Maes and Jacobs (2015) defining NBS as \"any transition to a use of ES with decreased input of non-renewable natural capital and increased investment in renewable natural processes\". In their view, development and evaluation of NBS spans three basic requirements: (1) decrease of fossil fuel input per produced unit; (2) lowering of systemic trade-offs and increasing synergies between ES; and (3) increasing labor input and jobs. Here, nature is seen as a tool to inspire more systemic solutions to societal problems.\n\nWhatever definition used, promoting sustainability and the increased role of natural, self-sustained processes relying on biodiversity, are inherent to NBS. They constitute actions easily seen as positive for a wide range of stakeholders, as they bring about benefits at environmental, economic and social levels. As a consequence, the concept of NBS is gaining acceptance outside the conservation community (e.g. urban planning) and is now on its way to be mainstreamed into policies and programmes (climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms).\n\nIn 2015, the European network BiodivERsA mobilized a range of scientists, research donors and stakeholders and proposed a typology characterizing NBS along two gradients. 1. \"how much engineering of biodiversity and ecosystems is involved in NBS\", and 2. \"how many ecosystem services and stakeholder groups are targeted by a given NBS\". The typology highlights that NBS can involve very different actions on ecosystems (from protection to management and even creation of new ecosystems) and is based on the assumption that the higher the number of services and stakeholder groups targeted, the lower the capacity to maximize the delivery of each service and simultaneously fulfil the specific needs of all stakeholder groups. As such, three types of NBS are distinguished (Figure 2):\n\nType 1 NBS consists of no or minimal intervention in ecosystems, with the objectives of maintaining or improving the delivery of a range of ES both inside and outside of these conserved ecosystems. Examples include the protection of mangroves in coastal areas to limit risks associated to extreme weather conditions and provide benefits and opportunities to local populations; and the establishment of marine protected areas to conserve biodiversity within these areas while exporting biomass into fishing grounds. This type of NBS is connected to, for example, the concept of biosphere reserves which incorporates core protected areas for nature conservation and buffer zones and transition areas where people live and work in a sustainable way.\n\nType 2 NBS corresponds to management approaches that develop sustainable and multifunctional ecosystems and landscapes (extensively or intensively managed). These types improve the delivery of selected ES compared to what would be obtained with a more conventional intervention. Examples include innovative planning of agricultural landscapes to increase their multi-functionality; and approaches for enhancing tree species and genetic diversity to increase forest resilience to extreme events. This type of NBS is strongly connected to concepts like natural systems agriculture, agro-ecology, and evolutionary-orientated forestry.\n\nType 3 NBS consists of managing ecosystems in very extensive ways or even creating new ecosystems (e.g., artificial ecosystems with new assemblages of organisms for green roofs and walls to mitigate city warming and clean polluted air). Type 3 is linked to concepts like green and blue infrastructures and objectives like restoration of heavily degraded or polluted areas and greening cities.\n\nType 1 and 2 would typically fall within the IUCN NBS framework, whereas Type 2 and moreover Type 3 are often exemplified by EC for turning natural capital into a source for green growth and sustainable development.\n\nHybrid solutions exist along this gradient both in space and time. For instance, at landscape scale, mixing protected and managed areas could be needed to fulfil multi-functionality and sustainability goals. Similarly, a constructed wetland can be developed as a type 3 but, when well established, may subsequently be preserved and surveyed as a type 1.\n\nDemonstrating the benefits of nature and healthy ecosystems and showcasing the return on investment they can offer is necessary in order to increase awareness, but also to provide support and guidance on how to implement NBS. A large number of initiatives around the world already highlight the effectiveness of NBS approaches to address a wide range of societal challenges.\n\nThe following table shows examples from around the world:\n\nIn 2018, The Hindu reported that the East Kolkata wetlands, the world's largest organic sewage treatment facility had been used to clean the sewage of Kolkata in an organic manner by using algae for several decades. In use since the 1930s, the natural system was discovered by Dhrubajyoti Ghosh, an ecologist and a municipal engineer in the 1970s while working in the region. Ghosh worked for decades to protect the wetlands. It had been a practice in Kolkata, one of the five largest cities in India, for the municipal authorities to pump sewage into shallow ponds (\"bheris\"). Under the heat of the tropical sun, algae proliferated in them, converting the sewage into clean water, which in turn was used by villagers to grow paddy and vegetables. This system has been in use in the region since the 1930s and treats 750 million litres of wastewater per day, giving livelihood to 100,000 people in the vicinity. For his work, Ghosh was included in the UN Global 500 Roll of Honour in 1990 and received the Luc Hoffmann award in 2016.\n\nThere is currently no accepted basis on which a government agency, municipality or private company can systematically assess the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of a particular nature-based solution. However, a series of principles are proposed to guide effective and appropriate implementation, and thus to upscale NBS in practice. For example, NBS embrace and are not meant to replace nature conservation norms. Also, NBS are determined by site-specific natural and cultural contexts that include traditional, local and scientific knowledge. NBS are an integral part of the overall design of policies, and measure or actions, to address a specific challenges. Finally, NBS can be implemented alone or in an integrated manner with other solutions to societal challenges (e.g. technological and engineering solutions) and they are applied at the landscape scale.\n\nImplementing NBS requires political, economic, and scientific challenges to be tackled. First and foremost, private sector investment is needed, not to replace but to supplement traditional sources of capital such as public funding or philanthropy. The challenge is therefore to provide a robust evidence base for the contribution of nature to economic growth and jobs, and to demonstrate the economic viability of these solutions – compared to technological ones – on a timescale compatible with that of global change. Furthermore, it requires measures like adaptation of economic subsidy schemes, and the creation of opportunities for conservation finance, to name a few. Indeed, such measures will be needed to scale up NBS interventions, and strengthen their impact in mitigating the world's most pressing challenges.\n\nSince 2016, the EU is supporting a multi-stakeholder dialogue platform (called ThinkNature) to promote the co-design, testing and deployment of improved and innovative NBS in an integrated way. Creation of such science-policy-business-society interfaces could promote the market uptake of NBS. The project is part of the EU’s Horizon 2020 – Research and Innovation programme, and will last for 3 years. There are a total of 17 international partners involved, including the Technical University of Crete (Project Leader), the University of Helsinki and BiodivERsA.\n\nIn 2017, as part of the Presidency of the Estonian Republic of the Council of the European Union, a conference called “Nature-based Solutions: From Innovation to Common-use” was organized by the Ministry of the Environment of Estonia and the University of Tallinn. This conference aimed to strengthen synergies among various recent initiatives and programs related to NBS launched by the European Commission and by the EU Member States, focusing on policy and governance of NBS, and on research and innovation.\n\nIn recognition of the importance of natural ecosystems for mitigation and adaptation, the Paris Agreement calls on all Parties to acknowledge “the importance of the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of the greenhouse gases” and to “note the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans, and the protection of biodiversity, recognized by some cultures as Mother Earth”. It then includes in its Articles several references to nature-based solutions. For example, Article 5.2 encourages Parties to adopt “…policy approaches and positive incentives for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the role of conservation and sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries; and alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, while reaffirming the importance of incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated with such approaches”. Article 7.1 further encourages Parties to build the resilience of socioeconomic and ecological systems, including through economic diversification and sustainable management of natural resources. In total, the Agreement refers to nature (ecosystems, natural resources, forests) in 13 distinct places. An in-depth analysis of all Nationally Determined Contributions submitted to UNFCCC, revealed that around 130 NDCs or 65% of signatories commit to nature-based solutions in their climate pledges, suggesting broad consensus for the role of nature in helping meet climate change goals. However, high-level commitments rarely translate into robust, measurable actions on-the-ground.\n\nThe term NBS was put forward by practitioners in the late 2000s (in particular the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and the World Bank) and thereafter by policymakers in Europe (most notably the European Commission). \n\nThe term \"nature-based solutions\" was first used in the late 2000s. It was used in the context of finding new solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change effects, whilst simultaneously protecting biodiversity and improving sustainable livelihoods. \n\nThe IUCN referred to NBS in a position paper for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The term was also adopted by European policymakers, in particular by the European Commission in a report stressing that NBS can offer innovative means to create jobs and growth as part of a green economy. The term started to make appearances in the mainstream media around the time of the Global Climate Action Summit in California in September 2018 \n\n\n"}

{"id": "15875167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15875167", "title": "Pickering emulsion", "text": "Pickering emulsion\n\nA Pickering emulsion is an emulsion that is stabilized by solid particles (for example colloidal silica) which adsorb onto the interface between the two phases. This type of emulsion was named after S.U. Pickering, who described the phenomenon in 1907, although the effect was first recognized by Walter Ramsden in 1903.\n\nIf oil and water are mixed and small oil droplets are formed and dispersed throughout the water, eventually the droplets will coalesce to decrease the amount of energy in the system. However, if solid particles are added to the mixture, they will bind to the surface of the interface and prevent the droplets from coalescing, making the emulsion more stable.\n\nProperties such as hydrophobicity, shape, and size of the particle can have an effect on the stability of the emulsion. The particle’s contact angle to the surface of the droplet is a characteristic of the hydrophobicity. If the contact angle of the particle to the interface is low, the particle will be mostly wetted by the droplet and therefore will not be likely to prevent coalescence of the droplets. Particles that are partially hydrophobic (i.e. contact angle of approximately 90°) are better stabilizers because they are partially wettable by both liquids and therefore bind better to the surface of the droplets. The stabilization energy is given by \nwhere r is the particle radius, formula_2 is the interfacial tension, and formula_3 is the contact angle. \n\nWhen the contact angle is approximately 90°, the energy required to stabilize the system is at its minimum.\nGenerally, the phase that preferentially wets the particle will be the continuous phase in the emulsion system.\n\nAdditionally, it has been demonstrated that the stability of the Pickering emulsions can be improved by the use of amphiphilic \"Janus particles\", namely particles that have one hydrophobic and one hydrophilic side, due to the higher adsorption energy of the particles at the liquid-liquid interface. This is evident when observing emulsion stabilization using polyelectrolytes.\n\nHomogenised milk is an example of a Pickering-stabilized emulsion. Casein (protein) units are adsorbed at the surface of milk fat globules and act as a surfactant. The casein replaces the milkfat globule membrane, which is damaged during homogenisation.\n\nIt is possible to use latex particles for Pickering stabilization and then fuse these particles to form a permeable shell or capsule, called a colloidosome. Moreover, Pickering emulsion droplets are also suitable templates for micro-encapsulation and the formation of closed, non-permeable capsules. This form of encapsulation can also be applied to water-in-water emulsions (dispersions of phase-separated aqueous polymer solutions), and can also be reversible.\n"}
{"id": "32624519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32624519", "title": "Pit (botany)", "text": "Pit (botany)\n\nPits are thin portions of the cell wall that adjacent cells can communicate or exchange fluid through. Pits are characteristic of cell walls with secondary layers. Generally each pit has a complementary pit opposite of it in the neighboring cell. These complementary pits are called \"pit pairs\".\n\nPits are composed of three parts: the pit chamber, the pit aperture, and the pit membrane. The pit chamber is the hollow area where the secondary layers of the cell wall are absent. The pit aperture is the opening at either end of the pit chamber. The pit membrane is the primary cell wall and middle lamella, or the membrane between adjacent cell walls, at the middle of the pit chamber.\n\nThe primary cell wall at the pit membrane may also have depressions similar to the pit depressions of the secondary layers. These depressions are primary pit-fields, or primary pits. In the primary pit, the primordial pit provides an interruption in the primary cell wall that the plasmodesmata can cross. The primordial pit is the only aperture in the otherwise continuous primary cell wall.\n\nPit pairs are a characteristic feature of the xylem, as sap flows through the pits of xylem cells.\n\nThough pits are usually simple and complementary, a few more pit variations can be formed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasmodesmata are thin sections of the endoplasmic reticulum that traverse pits and connect adjacent cells. These sections provide an avenue of transport through the pits and facilitate communication. Plasmodesmata are not restricted to pits however, as plasmodesmata often cross a cell wall of constant width and occasionally the cell wall is even wider in areas where plasmodesmata traverse it.\n\nThe torus and margo are characteristic features of bordered pit-pairs in gymnosperms, such as Coniferales, \"Ginkgo\", and \"Gnetales\". In other vascular plants, the torus is rare. The pit membrane is separated into two parts: a thick impermeable torus at the center of the pit membrane, and the permeable margo surrounding it. The torus regulates the functions of the bordered pit, and the margo is a cell wall-derived porous membrane that supports the torus. The margo is composed of bundles of microfibrils that radiate from the torus.\n\nThe margo is flexible and can move towards either side of the pit while under stress. This allows the thick, impermeable torus to block the pit aperture. When the torus is displaced so that it blocks the pit aperture, the pit is said to be aspirated.\n\n"}
{"id": "58134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58134", "title": "Proterozoic", "text": "Proterozoic\n\nThe Proterozoic () is a geological eon spanning the time from the appearance of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere to just before the proliferation of complex life (such as trilobites or corals) on the Earth. The name Proterozoic combines the two forms of ultimately Greek origin: \"protero-\" meaning \"former, earlier\", and \"-zoic\", a suffix related to \"zoe\" \"life\". The Proterozoic Eon extended from 2500 mya to 541 mya (million years ago), and is the most recent part of the Precambrian \"supereon\". The Proterozoic is the longest eon of the Earth's geologic time scale and it is subdivided into three geologic eras (from oldest to youngest): the Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic, and Neoproterozoic.\nThe well-identified events of this eon were the transition to an oxygenated atmosphere during the Paleoproterozoic; several glaciations, which produced the hypothesized Snowball Earth during the Cryogenian Period in the late Neoproterozoic Era; and the Ediacaran Period (635 to 541 Ma) which is characterized by the evolution of abundant soft-bodied multicellular organisms and provides us with the first obvious fossil evidence of life on earth.\n\nThe geologic record of the Proterozoic Eon is more complete than that for the preceding Archean Eon. In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas; furthermore, many of those rocks are less metamorphosed than are Archean ones, and many are unaltered. Studies of these rocks have shown that the eon continued the massive continental accretion that had begun late in the Archean Eon. The Proterozoic Eon also featured the first definitive supercontinent cycles and wholly modern mountain building activity (orogeny).\n\nThere is evidence that the first known glaciations occurred during the Proterozoic. The first began shortly after the beginning of the Proterozoic Eon, and evidence of at least four during the Neoproterozoic Era at the end of the Proterozoic Eon, possibly climaxing with the hypothesized Snowball Earth of the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations.\n\nOne of the most important events of the Proterozoic was the accumulation of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere. Though oxygen is believed to have been released by photosynthesis as far back as Archean Eon, it could not build up to any significant degree until mineral sinks of unoxidized sulfur and iron had been filled. Until roughly 2.3 billion years ago, oxygen was probably only 1% to 2% of its current level. The Banded iron formations, which provide most of the world's iron ore, are one mark of that mineral sink process. Their accumulation ceased after 1.9 billion years ago, after the iron in the oceans had all been oxidized.\n\nRed beds, which are colored by hematite, indicate an increase in atmospheric oxygen 2 billion years ago. Such massive iron oxide formations are not found in older rocks. The oxygen buildup was probably due to two factors: a filling of the chemical sinks, and an increase in carbon burial, which sequestered organic compounds that would have otherwise been oxidized by the atmosphere.\n\nThe Proterozoic Eon was a very tectonically active period in the Earth’s history. The late Archean Eon to Early Proterozoic Eon corresponds to a period of increasing crustal recycling, suggesting subduction. Evidence for this increased subduction activity comes from the abundance of old granites originating mostly after 2.6 Ga. The appearance of eclogites, which metamorphic rocks created by high pressure (>1 GPa), are explained using a model that incorporates subduction. The lack of eclogites that date to the Archean Eon suggests that conditions at that time did not favor the formation of high grade metamorphism and therefore did not achieve the same levels of subduction as was occurring in the Proterozoic Eon. As a result of remelting of basaltic oceanic crust due to subduction, the cores of the first continents grew large enough to withstand the crustal recycling processes. The long-term tectonic stability of those cratons is why we find continental crust ranging up to a few billion years in age. It is believed that 43% of modern continental crust was formed in the Proterozoic, 39% formed in the Archean, and only 18% in the Phanerozoic. Studies by Condie 2000 and Rino et al. 2004 suggest that crust production happened episodically. By isotopically calculating the ages of Proterozoic granitoids it was determined that there were several episodes of rapid increase in continental crust production. The reason for these pulses is unknown, but they seemed to have decreased in magnitude after every period.\n\nEvidence of collision and rifting between continents raises the question as to what exactly were the movements of the Archean cratons composing Proterozoic continents. Paleomagnetic and geochronological dating mechanisms have allowed the deciphering of Precambrian Supereon tectonics. It is known that tectonic processes of the Proterozoic Eon resemble greatly the evidence of tectonic activity, such as orogenic belts or ophiolite complexes, we see today. Hence, most geologists would conclude that the Earth was active at that time. It is also commonly accepted that during the Precambrian, the Earth went through several supercontinent breakup and rebuilding cycles (Wilson cycle). In the late Proterozoic (most recent), the dominant supercontinent was Rodinia (~1000–750 Ma). It consisted of a series of continents attached to a central craton that forms the core of the North American Continent called Laurentia. An example of an orogeny (mountain building processes) associated with the construction of Rodinia is the Grenville orogeny located in Eastern North America. Rodinia formed after the breakup of the supercontinent Columbia and prior to the assemblage of the supercontinent Gondwana (~500 Ma). The defining orogenic event associated with the formation of Gondwana was the collision of Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia forming the Pan-African orogeny.\n\nColumbia was dominant in the early-mid Proterozoic and not much is known about continental assemblages before then. There are a few plausible models that explain tectonics of the early Earth pre-Columbia, but the current most plausible theory is that prior to Columbia, there were only a few independent craton formations scattered around the Earth (not necessarily a supercontinent formation like Rodinia or Columbia).\n\nThe first advanced single-celled, eukaryotes and multi-cellular life, Francevillian Group Fossils, roughly coincides with the start of the accumulation of free oxygen. This may have been due to an increase in the oxidized nitrates that eukaryotes use, as opposed to cyanobacteria. It was also during the Proterozoic that the first symbiotic relationships between mitochondria (found in nearly all eukaryotes) and chloroplasts (found in plants and some protists only) and their hosts evolved.\n\nThe blossoming of eukaryotes such as acritarchs did not preclude the expansion of cyanobacteria; in fact, stromatolites reached their greatest abundance and diversity during the Proterozoic, peaking roughly 1200 million years ago.\n\nClassically, the boundary between the Proterozoic and the Phanerozoic eons was set at the base of the Cambrian Period when the first fossils of animals including trilobites and archeocyathids appeared. In the second half of the 20th century, a number of fossil forms have been found in Proterozoic rocks, but the upper boundary of the Proterozoic has remained fixed at the base of the Cambrian, which is currently placed at 541 Ma.\n\n"}
{"id": "45020815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45020815", "title": "Residuum (geology)", "text": "Residuum (geology)\n\nResiduum is often used to refer to the soil and subsoil that forms as the result of long weathering over carbonate rocks (limestone and dolomite) bedrock. It is defined primarily as “the unconsolidated weathered at least partly, mineral material that has accumulated as consolidated rocks disintegrated in place. It is a type of soil parent material which has formed in place of origin. This distinguishes residuum from most other types of parent material. Parent material is classified by mode of transport.\n\nParent material is one of the soil forming factors defined as “unconsolidated organic and mineral materials in which soils form”. Making Parent material an important part of the soil forming process. The other soil forming factors are climate, organisms, relief and time. Parent materials are classified by their mode of transport into a system. These modes of transport are by wind (aeloian), water, ice (glacial till), lakes (lacustrine), oceans (marine) or in place (non transported).\n\nSoils derived from residuum are called residual soils. These soils are expected to mineralogically similar to their underlying bedrock. While residuum is similar to the term regolith, it is more specific. While regolith refers to all unconsolidated earth materials above the solid bed rock, including transported sediments such as sand or alluvium, residuum is strictly a non transported parent material. However, parent materials formed in place or \"in-situ\" can further be classified as saprolite or residuum. Residuum differs from saprolite through its structure and degree of weathering. Saprolite is commonly referring to weathered material retaining details or structural features of the bedrock. The distinguishing feature between these is that residuum no longer retains the structural features or details of its bed rock. It has undergone greater transformation and experienced a decrease in volume from its origins as saprolite and bedrock. This is what is known as consolidation.\n\nResiduum and their associated residual soils are a produced through chemical weathering of their bedrock. These soils and subsoils typically have their origins in hot humid tropical locations. Their thickness varies with climates. In temperate climate its presence is in relatively lower amounts occurring as a “thin blanket of loose material above the bedrock. In tropical climates it can be much thicker”. A certain degree of landscape stability is inferred for residual soils. Identification and survey of these soils are most conclusive \"where fresh outcrops are rare and all surface materials look alike\". In contrast, \"a decrease in the amount of rock fragments as depth increases, especially over saprolite, indicates that the soil materials probably has been transported down slope\". Identification of residuum is relevant in soil science and geology because accurate identification conveys direct and implicit info about soil itself, the environment in which it formed, and its current environment. Soils provide a records of prevailing and past environments climates and human activities and much more.\n\nIn limestone terrains the boundary between bedrock and residuum is commonly very sharp, but may be highly irregular, defining pinnacles and even isolated blocks of fresh bedrock surrounded by reddish residual silts and clays derived from its decomposition. Resistant materials such as chert, silicified fossils, or beds of sandstone remain and may concentrate on the surface as float.\n"}

Stone lines that are more than one stone thick have been called ‘stone zones’. Stone lines and stone zones are known to occur in soils, paleosols (buried soils), and in non-soil geologic-stratigraphic sequences. Where present in stratigraphic sequences, if the units were deposited by running water, the stones are usually imbricated (individual stones are lapped, or leaning, upon one another in the direction of water flow). This is strong evidence that such stone lines are geogenic. On the other hand, a stone line that is present in a soil or a paleosol is invariable non-imbricated and follows (mimics) the surface topography of the soil, or the paleosurface of a paleosol. This is strong evidence that such stone lines are pedogenic, and produced by soil forming processes. As it turns out, experience has shown that most stone lines are indeed associated with soils and paleosols, and most are consequently assumed to be pedogenic. How stone lines form, whether geogenically by geologic processes or pedogenically by soil forming processes is invariably a matter of interpretation (see Soil Biomantle). And whether the interpretation is geogenic or pedogenic often reflects the background and training of the interpreter.\n"}

The temperature of the thermopause could range from absolute zero to .\n\nBelow this, the atmosphere is defined to be active on the insolation received, due to the increased presence of heavier gases such as monatomic oxygen. The solar constant is thus expressed at the thermopause. Beyond (above) this, the exosphere describes the thinnest remainder of atmospheric particles with large mean free path, mostly hydrogen and helium. As a limit for the exosphere this boundary is also called \"exobase\".\n\nThe exact altitude varies by the energy inputs of location, time of day, solar flux, season, etc. and can be between high at a given place and time because of these. A portion of the magnetosphere dips below this layer as well.\n\nAlthough these are all named layers of the atmosphere, the pressure is so negligible that the chiefly-used definitions of outer space are actually below this altitude. Orbiting satellites do not experience significant atmospheric heating, but their orbits do decay over time, depending on orbit altitude. Space missions such as the ISS, space shuttle, and Soyuz operate under this layer.\n\n"}
