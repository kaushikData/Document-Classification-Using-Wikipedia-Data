The name derives from the Old Norse \"kjarr\", meaning a swamp. The carr is one stage in a hydrosere: the progression of vegetation beginning from a terrain submerged by fresh water along a river or lake margin. In sub-maritime regions, it begins with reed-swamp. As the reeds decay, the soil surface eventually rises above the water, creating fens that allow vegetation such as sedge to grow. As this progression continues, riparian trees and bushes appear and a carr landscape is created–in effect a wooded fen in a waterlogged terrain. At this stage, overall, unlike overwhelming acidity of decaying reeds, the pH is not too acidic and the soil is not too deficient in minerals, making habitat for endemic and other wildlife. Characteristic trees include alder, willow and sallow.\n\n"}

{"id": "42841555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42841555", "title": "De Materia Medica", "text": "De Materia Medica\n\nDe Materia Medica (Latin name for the Greek work Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς, Peri hulēs iatrikēs, both meaning \"On Medical Material\") is a pharmacopoeia of herbs and the medicines that can be obtained from them. The five-volume work describes many drugs known to be effective, including aconite, aloes, colocynth, colchicum, henbane, opium and squill. In all, about 600 plants are covered, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from them.\n\nThe work was written between 50 and 70 AD by Pedanius Dioscorides, a Greek physician in the Roman army. It was widely read for more than 1,500 years until supplanted by revised herbals in the Renaissance, making it one of the longest-lasting of all natural history books.\n\n\"De Materia Medica\" was circulated as illustrated manuscripts, copied by hand, in Greek, Latin and Arabic throughout the mediaeval period. From the sixteenth century on, Dioscorides' text was translated into Italian, German, Spanish, and French, and in 1655 into English. It formed the basis for herbals in these languages by men such as Leonhart Fuchs, Valerius Cordus, Lobelius, Rembert Dodoens, Carolus Clusius, John Gerard and William Turner. Gradually these herbals included more and more direct observations, supplementing and eventually supplanting the classical text.\n\nSeveral manuscripts and early printed versions of \"De Materia Medica\" survive, including the illustrated Vienna Dioscurides manuscript written in the original Greek in sixth-century Constantinople; it was used there by the Byzantines as a hospital text for just over a thousand years. Sir Arthur Hill saw a monk on Mount Athos still using a copy of Dioscorides to identify plants in 1934.\n\nBetween 50 and 70 AD, a Greek physician in the Roman army, Dioscorides, wrote a five-volume book in his native Greek, (\"Peri hules iatrikēs\", \"On Medical Material\"), known more widely in Western Europe by its Latin title \"De Materia Medica\". He had studied pharmacology at Tarsus in Roman Anatolia (now Turkey). The book became the principal reference work on pharmacology across Europe and the Middle East for over 1500 years, and was thus the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias.\n\nIn contrast to many classical authors, \"De Materia Medica\" was not \"rediscovered\" in the Renaissance, because it never left circulation; indeed, Dioscorides' text eclipsed the Hippocratic corpus. In the medieval period, \"De Materia Medica\" was circulated in Latin, Greek, and Arabic. In the Renaissance from 1478 onwards, it was printed in Italian, German, Spanish, and French as well. In 1655, John Goodyer made an English translation from a printed version, probably not corrected from the Greek.\n\nWhile being reproduced in manuscript form through the centuries, the text was often supplemented with commentary and minor additions from Arabic and Indian sources. Several illustrated manuscripts of \"De Materia Medica\" survive. The most famous is the lavishly illustrated Vienna Dioscurides (the \"Juliana Anicia Codex\"), written in the original Greek in Byzantine Constantinople in 512/513 AD; its illustrations are sufficiently accurate to permit identification, something not possible with later medieval drawings of plants; some of them may be copied from a lost volume owned by Juliana Anicia's great grandfather, Theodosius II, in the early 5th century. The Naples Dioscurides and Morgan Dioscurides are somewhat later Byzantine manuscripts in Greek, while other Greek manuscripts survive today in the monasteries of Mount Athos. Densely illustrated Arabic copies survive from the 12th and 13th centuries. The result is a complex set of relationships between manuscripts, involving translation, copying errors, additions of text and illustrations, deletions, reworkings, and a combination of copying from one manuscript and correction from another.\n\n\"De Materia Medica\" is the prime historical source of information about the medicines used by the Greeks, Romans, and other cultures of antiquity. The work also records the Dacian names for some plants, which otherwise would have been lost. The work presents about 600 plants in all, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from these sources. Botanists have not always found Dioscorides' plants easy to identify from his short descriptions, partly because he had naturally described plants and animals from southeastern Europe, whereas by the sixteenth century his book was in use all over Europe and across the Islamic world. This meant that people attempted to force a match between the plants they knew and those described by Dioscorides, leading to what could be catastrophic results.\n\nEach entry gives a substantial amount of detail on the plant or substance in question, concentrating on medicinal uses but giving such mention of other uses (such as culinary) and help with recognition as considered necessary. For example, on the \"Mekon Agrios and Mekon Emeros\", the opium poppy and related species, Dioscorides states that the seed of one is made into bread: it has \"a somewhat long little head and white seed\", while another \"has a head bending down\" and a third is \"more wild, more medicinal and longer than these, with a head somewhat long — and they are all cooling.\" After this brief description, he moves at once into pharmacology, saying that they cause sleep; other uses are to treat inflammation and erysipela, and if boiled with honey to make a cough mixture. The account thus combines recognition, pharmacological effect, and guidance on drug preparation. Its effects are summarized, accompanied by a caution:\n\nDioscorides then describes how to tell a good from a counterfeit preparation. He mentions the recommendations of other physicians, Diagoras (according to Eristratus), Andreas, and Mnesidemus, only to dismiss them as false and not borne out by experience. He ends with a description of how the liquid is gathered from poppy plants, and lists names used for it: \"chamaesyce\", \"mecon\" \"rhoeas\", \"oxytonon\"; \"papaver\" to the Romans, and \"wanti\" to the Egyptians.\n\nAs late as in the Tudor and Stuart periods in Britain, herbals often still classified plants in the same way as Dioscorides and other classical authors, not by their structure or apparent relatedness but by how they smelt and tasted, whether they were edible, and what medicinal uses they had. Only when European botanists like Matthias de l'Obel, Andrea Cesalpino and Augustus Quirinus Rivinus (Bachmann) had done their best to match plants they knew to those listed in Dioscorides did they go further and create new classification systems based on similarity of parts, whether leaves, fruits, or flowers.\n\nThe book is divided into five volumes. Dioscorides organized the substances by certain similarities, such as their being aromatic, or vines; these divisions do not correspond to any modern classification. In David Sutton's view the grouping is by the type of effect on the human body.\n\nVolume I covers aromatic oils, the plants that provide them, and ointments made from them. They include what are probably cardamom, nard, valerian, cassia or senna, cinnamon, balm of Gilead, hops, mastic, turpentine, pine resin, bitumen, heather, quince, apple, peach, apricot, lemon, pear, medlar, plum and many others.\n\nVolume II covers an assortment of topics: animals including sea creatures such as sea urchin, seahorse, whelk, mussel, crab, scorpion, electric ray, viper, cuttlefish and many others; dairy produce; cereals; vegetables such as sea kale, beetroot, asparagus; and sharp herbs such as garlic, leek, onion, caper and mustard.\n\nVolume III covers roots, seeds and herbs. These include plants that may be rhubarb, gentian, liquorice, caraway, cumin, parsley, lovage, fennel and many others.\n\nVolume IV describes further roots and herbs not covered in Volume III. These include herbs that may be betony, Solomon's seal, clematis, horsetail, daffodil and many others.\n\nVolume V covers the grapevine, wine made from it, grapes and raisins; but also strong medicinal potions made by boiling many other plants including mandrake, hellebore, and various metal compounds, such as what may be zinc oxide, verdigris and iron oxide.\n\nAlong with his fellow physicians of Ancient Rome, Aulus Cornelius Celsus, Galen, Hippocrates and Soranus of Ephesus, Dioscorides had a major and long-lasting effect on Arabic medicine as well as medical practice across Europe. \n\"De materia medica\" was one of the first scientific works to be translated from Greek into Arabic. It was translated first into Syriac and then into Arabic in 9th century Baghdad.\n\nWriting in \"The Great Naturalists\", the historian of science David Sutton describes \"De Materia Medica\" as \"one of the most enduring works of natural history ever written\" and that \"it formed the basis for Western knowledge of medicines for the next 1,500 years.\"\n\nThe historian of science Marie Boas writes that herbalists depended entirely on Dioscorides and Theophrastus until the sixteenth century, when they finally realized they could work on their own. She notes also that herbals by different authors, such as Leonhart Fuchs, Valerius Cordus, Lobelius, Rembert Dodoens, Carolus Clusius, John Gerard and William Turner, were dominated by Dioscorides, his influence only gradually weakening as the sixteenth century herbalists \"learned to add and substitute their own observations\".\n\nThe historian of early science and medicine Paula Findlen, writing in the \"Cambridge History of Science\", calls \"De Materia Medica\" \"one of the most successful and enduring herbals of antiquity, [which] emphasized the importance of understanding the natural world in light of its medicinal efficiency\", in contrast to Pliny's \"Natural History\" (which emphasized the wonders of nature) or the natural history studies of Aristotle and Theophrastus (which emphasized the causes of natural phenomena).\n\nThe historian of medicine Vivian Nutton, in \"Ancient Medicine\", writes that Dioscorides's \"five books in Greek On Materia medica attained canonical status in Late Antiquity.\"\n\nThe historian of science Brian Ogilvie calls Dioscorides \"the greatest ancient herbalist\", and \"De Materia Medica\" \"the \"summa\" of ancient descriptive botany\", observing that its success was such that few other books in his domain have survived from classical times. Further, his approach matched the Renaissance liking for detailed description, unlike the philosophical search for essential nature (as in Theophrastus's \"Historia Plantarum\"). A critical moment was the decision by Niccolò Leoniceno and others to use Dioscorides \"as the model of the careful naturalist—and his book \"De Materia Medica\" as the model for natural history.\"\n\nThe Dioscorides translator and editor Tess Anne Osbaldeston notes that \"For almost two millennia Dioscorides was regarded as the ultimate authority on plants and medicine\", and that he \"achieved overwhelming commendation and approval because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind most usefully.\" To illustrate this, she states that \"Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including aconite, aloes, bitter apple, colchicum, henbane, and squill\". The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to aspirin, she writes), autumn crocus and opium, which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as \"minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and emollients ... [such as] ammoniacum, anise, cardamoms, catechu, cinnamon, colocynth, coriander, crocus, dill, fennel, galbanum, gentian, hemlock, hyoscyamus, lavender, linseed, mastic, male fern, marjoram, marshmallow, mezereon, mustard, myrrh, orris (iris), oak galls, olive oil, pennyroyal, pepper, peppermint, poppy, psyllium, rhubarb, rosemary, rue, saffron, sesame, squirting cucumber (elaterium), starch, stavesacre (delphinium), storax, stramonium, sugar, terebinth, thyme, white hellebore, white horehound, and couch grass — the last still used as a demulcent diuretic.\" She notes that medicines such as wormwood, juniper, ginger, and calamine also remain in use, while \"Chinese and Indian physicians continue to use liquorice\". She observes that the many drugs listed to reduce the spleen may be explained by the frequency of malaria in his time. Dioscorides lists drugs for women to cause abortion and to treat urinary tract infection; palliatives for toothache, such as colocynth, and others for intestinal pains; and treatments for skin and eye diseases. As well as these useful substances, she observes that \"A few superstitious practices are recorded in \"De Materia Medica\",\" such as using \"Echium\" as an amulet to ward off snakes, or \"Polemonia\" (Jacob's ladder) for scorpion stings.\n\nIn the view of the historian Paula De Vos, \"De Materia Medica\" formed the core of the European pharmacopoeia until the end of the 19th century, suggesting that \"the timelessness of Dioscorides' work resulted from an empirical tradition based on trial and error; that it worked for generation after generation despite social and cultural changes and changes in medical theory\".\n\nAt Mount Athos in northern Greece Dioscorides's text was still in use in its original Greek into the 20th century, as observed in 1934 by Sir Arthur Hill, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew: \n\n\n\n\n\"Note: Editions may vary by both text and numbering of chapters\"\n\n\n\n"}

Denmark expects to be self-sufficient with oil until 2050. However, gas resources are expected to decline, and production may decline below consumption in 2020, making imports necessary.\nA large but decreasing proportion of electricity is produced from coal, and hydropower and 3-4% nuclear power is imported while wind turbines supply the equivalent of about 42% of electricity demand by 2015 (see Wind power in Denmark).\n\nIn February 2011 the Danish government announced the \"Energy Strategy 2050\" with the aim to be fully independent of fossil fuels by 2050, and a new government repeated the goal in 2015 despite public scepticism.\nThe European Renewables Directive set a mandatory target at 20% share of energy from renewable sources by 2020 (EU combined). In 2012 the Danish government adopted a plan to increase the share of electricity production from wind to 50% by 2020, and to 84% in 2035.\n\nDenmark's electrical grid is connected by transmission lines to other European countries, and had (according to the World Economic Forum) the best energy security in the EU in 2013 although this had fallen to third in the EU by 2014. Denmark imports around 12% of its energy.\n\nIn 1972, 92% of Denmark's energy consumption came from imported oil. The 1973 oil crisis forced Denmark to rethink its energy policy; in 1978 coal contributed 18%, and the Tvind wind turbine was built, along with the creation of a wind turbine industry. The 1979 energy crisis pushed further change, and in 1984 the North Sea natural gas projects began. The North Sea production of oil and gas made Denmark self-sufficient in 1997, peaking in 2005, and decreased below self-sufficiency by 2013. In 2015 Denmark produced 89% of its energy consumption of 720-756 PJ.\n\nThe year 2014 was the warmest on record in Denmark, with the lowest number of degree days in history. A normal year has 2,906 while 2014 saw only 2,100 degree days. Since 2000, Denmark has increased Gross National Product and decreased energy consumption.\n\nNot applicable for industry\n\nFuel is not taxed for ships and planes to other countries. Coal and gas for electricity is not taxed.\n\nMinor taxes are called \"Compulsory storage fee\" and \" tax\". Carbon dioxide tax is 0.09 DKK/kWh for electricity. Fossil fuels are taxed at about 90 DKK/ton CO2.\n\nEnergy taxes contributed 34 billion DKK in 2015, about 12% of overall taxing revenue. The money is a considerable income for the state, and changing the composition of the taxes towards a \"greener\" mix is difficult. According to a government official, the majority of taxes are not based on environment concerns, in contrast to the DKK 5 billion per year in PSO-money for cleaner energy, paid by electricity consumers to producers of clean electricity. These tolls are not available for government consumption.\n\nCoal power provided 48.0% of the electricity and 22.0% of the heat in district heating in Denmark in 2008; and in total provided 21.6% of total energy consumption (187 PJ out of 864 PJ). The coal is mainly imported from outside Europe. Consumption of coal was more than halved over the 10 years between 2004-2014. Coal constituted 41% of the mass fuels (not wind and sun) in 2015, and is expected to decrease to 14% in 2025, mostly replaced by biofuels.\n\nThe production of crude oil fell from 523 PJ in 2010 to 470 PJ in 2011. As of May 2014, Denmark produced an average of 172 kbpd. Danish oil companies donate DKK 1 billion over 10 years to Technical University of Denmark to increase production. Danish oil reserves are expected to run out around 2047.\n\nConsumption fell from 315 to 306 PJ during 2011. Official statistics estimate 231,000 residences heated by oil in 2014 (down from 328,000 in 2013), but only 87,000 actually purchased oil during 2014.\n\nThe production of natural gas fell from 307 PJ in 2010 to 265 PJ in 2011. Consumption fell from 187 to 157 PJ.\n\nCO2 emissions from energy production fell from 49.4 to 44.3 million tons, from 2010 to 2011, a decline of 10%.\n\nDenmark consumed 2.1 million tonnes of wood pellets in 2014, expected to increase by 1.2 million tonnes as more coal is replaced. They are mainly imported from the Baltic states and Russia. Denmark also burns wood chips and straw, mostly for heating.\n\nDenmark had 790 MW of photovoltaic capacity in late 2015, and already reached its year 2020 governmental goal of installing 200 MW in 2012. As of 2013, the total PV capacity from 90,000 private installations amounts to 500 MW. Danish energy sector players estimate that this development will result in 1000 MW by 2020 and 3400 MW by 2030.\n\nSolar heating is installed in some homes, and also used in district heating.\n\nDenmark has three geothermal district heating plants; a 7 MW in Thisted started in 1988, a 14 MW in Copenhagen started in 2005, and a 12 MW in Sønderborg in 2013. They may combine with biomass burning, but produce no electricity, as temperatures are too low.\n\nThe electricity sector relies on fossil, nuclear and renewable energy: wind power, biogas, biomass and waste. No hydro power is produced domestically and other countries' hydro and thermal power is used for buffering Denmark's renewable generation. The average consumption of electricity per person was 0.8 GWh less than EU 15 average in 2008. Denmark invested in the wind power development in the 1970s and has been the top wind power country of the world ever since. Danish consumption of wind electricity has been highest in the world per person: 1,218 kWh in 2009. Denmark produced more wind power per person in 2009 than Spain or the UK produced nuclear power.\n\nDenmark has mediocre electricity costs (including about DKK 5 billion in costs for cleaner energy) in EU for industries at 9 eurocent/kWh, but general taxes increase the household price to the highest in Europe at 31 eurocent/kWh.\n\nTransmission costs are around 1c/kWh, and support regimes cost 2½ c/kWh in 2014.\n\nWind provided 39% of the electricity generated in Denmark in 2014, and 42.1% of Denmark's total electricity consumption in 2015. Denmark is a long-time leader in wind energy, and Denmark derives 3.1 percent of its Gross Domestic Product from renewable energy technology and energy efficiency, or around €6.5 billion ($9.4 billion).\n\nTo encourage investment in wind power, families were offered a tax exemption for generating their own electricity within their own or an adjoining commune. While this could involve purchasing a turbine outright, more often families purchased shares in wind turbine cooperatives which in turn invested in community wind turbines. By 2004 over 150,000 Danes were either members of cooperatives or owned turbines, and about 5,500 turbines had been installed, although with greater private sector involvement the proportion owned by cooperatives had fallen to 75%.\n\nThe production of nuclear energy has been banned in Denmark since 1985. In 2014 and 2015, (imported) nuclear power was 3-4% of electricity consumption in Denmark. An average of 10% of domestic energy consumption comes from imports from neighboring countries Sweden and Germany, which both generate nuclear power. In Sweden, about 40% of the energy is generated by nuclear power and in Germany less than 20% by nuclear power. In 2011, with imports of 2.9 TWh from Germany and 5.2 TWh from Sweden, about 3.5TWh used was from countries that generate nuclear power – nearly 11% of total final consumption. This fluctuates year to year, mainly due to NordPool prices, and Energinet.dk analysis showed 1% from countries that generate nuclear power in 2010, 7% in 2011 and 14% in 2012.\n\nDanish district heating plants use 100 Petajoule/year, mostly waste heat from thermal power plants burning coal, natural gas and biomass, but a small part of this consumption is from electrode boilers or heat pumps. Expansion of wind powered district heating is calculated to be economically efficient without taxes. The peak thermal load of district heating in Copenhagen is 2.5 GW, and simulations suggest a potential heat pump would run 3,500 load-hours per year using sewage water as the heat reservoir. \n\nIn 2013, Denmark imported 158,000 ton garbage for incineration in 10 district heating plants, increasing to 323,963 ton in 20 plants in 2015, about 10% of burnt waste.\n\nThe pipe heat loss is 17%, at a value of DKK 150 million. New pipes have a heat loss of 6.5%. There are 60,000 km of pipes, serving 1.6 million households. Several towns use central solar heating, some with storage.\n\nDenmark aims to focus on intelligent battery systems (V2G) and plug-in vehicles in the transport sector.\n\nTax revenue from vehicles was 28 billion DKK in 2014.\n\nCopenhagen has a target to be carbon-neutral by 2025, and has burned more biomass and less coal during 2004-2014.\n\nAarhus aims to be carbon-neutral by 2030.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10490785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10490785", "title": "Evolution of the horse", "text": "Evolution of the horse\n\nThe evolution of the horse, a mammal of the family Equidae, occurred over a geologic time scale of 50 million years, transforming the small, dog-sized, forest-dwelling \"Eohippus\" into the modern horse. Paleozoologists have been able to piece together a more complete outline of the evolutionary lineage of the modern horse than of any other animal. Much of this evolution took place in North America, where horses originated but became extinct about 10,000 years ago.\n\nThe horse belongs to the order Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates), the members of which all share hooved feet and an odd number of toes on each foot, as well as mobile upper lips and a similar tooth structure. This means that horses share a common ancestry with tapirs and rhinoceroses. The perissodactyls arose in the late Paleocene, less than 10 million years after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. This group of animals appears to have been originally specialized for life in tropical forests, but whereas tapirs and, to some extent, rhinoceroses, retained their jungle specializations, modern horses are adapted to life on drier land, in the much harsher climatic conditions of the steppes. Other species of \"Equus\" are adapted to a variety of intermediate conditions.\n\nThe early ancestors of the modern horse walked on several spread-out toes, an accommodation to life spent walking on the soft, moist grounds of primeval forests. As grass species began to appear and flourish, the equids' diets shifted from foliage to grasses, leading to larger and more durable teeth. At the same time, as the steppes began to appear, the horse's predecessors needed to be capable of greater speeds to outrun predators. This was attained through the lengthening of limbs and the lifting of some toes from the ground in such a way that the weight of the body was gradually placed on one of the longest toes, the third.\n\nWild horses were known since prehistory from central Asia to Europe, with domestic horses and other equids being distributed more widely in the Old World, but no horses or equids of any type were found in the New World when European explorers reached the Americas. When the Spanish colonists brought domestic horses from Europe, beginning in 1493, escaped horses quickly established large feral herds. In the 1760s, the early naturalist Buffon suggested this was an indication of inferiority of the New World fauna, but later reconsidered this idea. William Clark's 1807 expedition to Big Bone Lick found \"leg and foot bones of the Horses\", which were included with other fossils sent to Thomas Jefferson and evaluated by the anatomist Caspar Wistar, but neither commented on the significance of this find.\n\nThe first Old World equid fossil was found in the gypsum quarries in Montmartre, Paris, in the 1820s. The tooth was sent to the Paris Conservatory, where it was identified by Georges Cuvier, who identified it as a browsing equine related to the tapir. His sketch of the entire animal matched later skeletons found at the site.\n\nDuring the \"Beagle\" survey expedition, the young naturalist Charles Darwin had remarkable success with fossil hunting in Patagonia. On 10 October 1833, at Santa Fe, Argentina, he was \"filled with astonishment\" when he found a horse's tooth in the same stratum as fossil giant armadillos, and wondered if it might have been washed down from a later layer, but concluded this was \"not very probable\". After the expedition returned in 1836, the anatomist Richard Owen confirmed the tooth was from an extinct species, which he subsequently named \"Equus curvidens\", and remarked, \"This evidence of the former existence of a genus, which, as regards South America, had become extinct, and has a second time been introduced into that Continent, is not one of the least interesting fruits of Mr. Darwin's palæontological discoveries.\"\n\nIn 1848, a study \"On the fossil horses of America\" by Joseph Leidy systematically examined Pleistocene horse fossils from various collections, including that of the Academy of Natural Sciences, and concluded at least two ancient horse species had existed in North America: \"Equus curvidens\" and another, which he named \"Equus americanus\". A decade later, however, he found the latter name had already been taken and renamed it \"Equus complicatus\". In the same year, he visited Europe and was introduced by Owen to Darwin.\nThe original sequence of species believed to have evolved into the horse was based on fossils discovered in North America in the 1870s by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. The sequence, from \"Eohippus\" to the modern horse (\"Equus\"), was popularized by Thomas Huxley and became one of the most widely known examples of a clear evolutionary progression. The horse's evolutionary lineage became a common feature of biology textbooks, and the sequence of transitional fossils was assembled by the American Museum of Natural History into an exhibit that emphasized the gradual, \"straight-line\" evolution of the horse.\n\nSince then, as the number of equid fossils has increased, the actual evolutionary progression from \"Eohippus\" to \"Equus\" has been discovered to be much more complex and multibranched than was initially supposed. The straight, direct progression from the former to the latter has been replaced by a more elaborate model with numerous branches in different directions, of which the modern horse is only one of many. George Gaylord Simpson in 1951 first recognized that the modern horse was not the \"goal\" of the entire lineage of equids, but is simply the only genus of the many horse lineages to survive.\n\nDetailed fossil information on the distribution and rate of change of new equid species has also revealed that the progression between species was not as smooth and consistent as was once believed. Although some transitions, such as that of \"Dinohippus\" to \"Equus\", were indeed gradual progressions, a number of others, such as that of \"Epihippus\" to \"Mesohippus\", were relatively abrupt in geologic time, taking place over only a few million years. Both anagenesis (gradual change in an entire population's gene frequency) and cladogenesis (a population \"splitting\" into two distinct evolutionary branches) occurred, and many species coexisted with \"ancestor\" species at various times. The change in equids' traits was also not always a \"straight line\" from \"Eohippus\" to \"Equus\": some traits reversed themselves at various points in the evolution of new equid species, such as size and the presence of facial \"fossae\", and only in retrospect can certain evolutionary trends be recognized.\n\nPhenacodontidae is the most recent family in the order Condylarthra believed to be the ancestral to the odd-toed ungulates. It contains the genera \"Almogaver\", \"Copecion\", \"Ectocion\", \"Eodesmatodon\", \"Meniscotherium\", \"Ordathspidotherium\", \"Phenacodus\" and \"Pleuraspidotherium\". The family lived from the Early Paleocene to the Middle Eocene in Europe and were about the size of a sheep, with tails making slightly less than half of the length of their bodies and unlike their ancestors, good running skills for eluding predators.\n\n\"Eohippus\" appeared in the Ypresian (early Eocene), about 52 mya (million years ago). It was an animal approximately the size of a fox (250–450 mm in height), with a relatively short head and neck and a springy, arched back. It had 44 low-crowned teeth, in the typical arrangement of an omnivorous, browsing mammal: three incisors, one canine, four premolars, and three molars on each side of the jaw. Its molars were uneven, dull, and bumpy, and used primarily for grinding foliage. The cusps of the molars were slightly connected in low crests. \"Eohippus\" browsed on soft foliage and fruit, probably scampering between thickets in the mode of a modern muntjac. It had a small brain, and possessed especially small frontal lobes.\n\nIts limbs were long relative to its body, already showing the beginnings of adaptations for running. However, all of the major leg bones were unfused, leaving the legs flexible and rotatable. Its wrist and hock joints were low to the ground. The forelimbs had developed five toes, of which four were equipped with small proto-hooves; the large fifth \"toe-thumb\" was off the ground. The hind limbs had small hooves on three out of the five toes, while the vestigial first and fifth toes did not touch the ground. Its feet were padded, much like a dog's, but with the small hooves in place of claws.\n\nFor a span of about 20 million years, \"Eohippus\" thrived with few significant evolutionary changes. The most significant change was in the teeth, which began to adapt to its changing diet, as these early Equidae shifted from a mixed diet of fruits and foliage to one focused increasingly on browsing foods. During the Eocene, an \"Eohippus\" species (most likely \"Eohippus angustidens\") branched out into various new types of Equidae. Thousands of complete, fossilized skeletons of these animals have been found in the Eocene layers of North American strata, mainly in the Wind River basin in Wyoming. Similar fossils have also been discovered in Europe, such as \"Propalaeotherium\" (which is not considered ancestral to the modern horse).\n\nApproximately 50 million years ago, in the early-to-middle Eocene, \"Eohippus\" smoothly transitioned into \"Orohippus\" through a gradual series of changes. Although its name means \"mountain horse\", \"Orohippus\" was not a true horse and did not live in the mountains. It resembled \"Eohippus\" in size, but had a slimmer body, an elongated head, slimmer forelimbs, and longer hind legs, all of which are characteristics of a good jumper. Although \"Orohippus\" was still pad-footed, the vestigial outer toes of \"Eohippus\" were not present in \"Orohippus\"; there were four toes on each fore leg, and three on each hind leg.\n\nThe most dramatic change between \"Eohippus\" and \"Orohippus\" was in the teeth: the first of the premolar teeth were dwarfed, the last premolar shifted in shape and function into a molar, and the crests on the teeth became more pronounced. Both of these factors gave the teeth of \"Orohippus\" greater grinding ability, suggesting \"Orohippus\" ate tougher plant material.\n\nIn the mid-Eocene, about 47 million years ago, \"Epihippus\", a genus which continued the evolutionary trend of increasingly efficient grinding teeth, evolved from \"Orohippus\". \"Epihippus\" had five grinding, low-crowned cheek teeth with well-formed crests. A late species of \"Epihippus\", sometimes referred to as \"Duchesnehippus intermedius\", had teeth similar to Oligocene equids, although slightly less developed. Whether \"Duchesnehippus\" was a subgenus of \"Epihippus\" or a distinct genus is disputed. \"Epihippus\" was only 2 feet tall.\n\nIn the late Eocene and the early stages of the Oligocene epoch (32–24 mya), the climate of North America became drier, and the earliest grasses began to evolve. The forests were yielding to flatlands, home to grasses and various kinds of brush. In a few areas, these plains were covered in sand, creating the type of environment resembling the present-day prairies.\nIn response to the changing environment, the then-living species of Equidae also began to change. In the late Eocene, they began developing tougher teeth and becoming slightly larger and leggier, allowing for faster running speeds in open areas, and thus for evading predators in nonwooded areas. About 40 mya, \"Mesohippus\" (\"middle horse\") suddenly developed in response to strong new selective pressures to adapt, beginning with the species \"Mesohippus celer\" and soon followed by \"Mesohippus westoni\".\n\nIn the early Oligocene, \"Mesohippus\" was one of the more widespread mammals in North America. It walked on three toes on each of its front and hind feet (the first and fifth toes remained, but were small and not used in walking). The third toe was stronger than the outer ones, and thus more weighted; the fourth front toe was diminished to a vestigial nub. Judging by its longer and slimmer limbs, \"Mesohippus\" was an agile animal.\n\n\"Mesohippus\" was slightly larger than \"Epihippus\", about 610 mm (24 in) at the shoulder. Its back was less arched, and its face, snout, and neck were somewhat longer. It had significantly larger cerebral hemispheres, and had a small, shallow depression on its skull called a fossa, which in modern horses is quite detailed. The fossa serves as a useful marker for identifying an equine fossil's species. \"Mesohippus\" had six grinding \"cheek teeth\", with a single premolar in front—a trait all descendant Equidae would retain. \"Mesohippus\" also had the sharp tooth crests of \"Epihippus\", improving its ability to grind down tough vegetation.\n\nAround 36 million years ago, soon after the development of \"Mesohippus\", \"Miohippus\" (\"lesser horse\") emerged, the earliest species being \"Miohippus assiniboiensis\". As with \"Mesohippus\", the appearance of \"Miohippus\" was relatively abrupt, though a few transitional fossils linking the two genera have been found. \"Mesohippus\" was once believed to have anagenetically evolved into \"Miohippus\" by a gradual series of progressions, but new evidence has shown its evolution was cladogenetic: a \"Miohippus\" population split off from the main genus \"Mesohippus\", coexisted with \"Mesohippus\" for around four million years, and then over time came to replace \"Mesohippus\".\n\n\"Miohippus\" was significantly larger than its predecessors, and its ankle joints had subtly changed. Its facial fossa was larger and deeper, and it also began to show a variable extra crest in its upper cheek teeth, a trait that became a characteristic feature of equine teeth.\n\n\"Miohippus\" ushered in a major new period of diversification in Equidae.\n\nThe forest-suited form was \"Kalobatippus\" (or \"Miohippus intermedius\", depending on whether it was a new genus or species), whose second and fourth front toes were long, well-suited travel on the soft forest floors. \"Kalobatippus\" probably gave rise to \"Anchitherium\", which travelled to Asia via the Bering Strait land bridge, and from there to Europe. In both North America and Eurasia, larger-bodied genera evolved from \"Anchitherium\": \"Sinohippus\" in Eurasia and \"Hypohippus\" and \"Megahippus\" in North America. \"Hypohippus\" became extinct by the late Miocene.\n\nThe \"Miohippus\" population that remained on the steppes is believed to be ancestral to \"Parahippus\", a North American animal about the size of a small pony, with a prolonged skull and a facial structure resembling the horses of today. Its third toe was stronger and larger, and carried the main weight of the body. Its four premolars resembled the molar teeth; the first were small and almost nonexistent. The incisor teeth, like those of its predecessors, had a crown (like human incisors); however, the top incisors had a trace of a shallow crease marking the beginning of the core/cup.\n\nIn the middle of the Miocene epoch, the grazer \"Merychippus\" flourished. It had wider molars than its predecessors, which are believed to have been used for crunching the hard grasses of the steppes. The hind legs, which were relatively short, had side toes equipped with small hooves, but they probably only touched the ground when running. \"Merychippus\" radiated into at least 19 additional grassland species.\n\nThree lineages within Equidae are believed to be descended from the numerous varieties of \"Merychippus\": \"Hipparion\", \"Protohippus\" and \"Pliohippus\". The most different from \"Merychippus\" was \"Hipparion\", mainly in the structure of tooth enamel: in comparison with other Equidae, the inside, or tongue side, had a completely isolated parapet. A complete and well-preserved skeleton of the North American \"Hipparion\" shows an animal the size of a small pony. They were very slim, rather like antelopes, and were adapted to life on dry prairies. On its slim legs, \"Hipparion\" had three toes equipped with small hooves, but the side toes did not touch the ground.\n\nIn North America, \"Hipparion\" and its relatives (\"Cormohipparion\", \"Nannippus\", \"Neohipparion\", and \"Pseudhipparion\"), proliferated into many kinds of equids, at least one of which managed to migrate to Asia and Europe during the Miocene epoch. (European \"Hipparion\" differs from American \"Hipparion\" in its smaller body size – the best-known discovery of these fossils was near Athens.)\n\n\"Pliohippus\" arose from \"Callippus\" in the middle Miocene, around 12 mya. It was very similar in appearance to \"Equus\", though it had two long extra toes on both sides of the hoof, externally barely visible as callused stubs. The long and slim limbs of \"Pliohippus\" reveal a quick-footed steppe animal.\n\nUntil recently, \"Pliohippus\" was believed to be the ancestor of present-day horses because of its many anatomical similarities. However, though \"Pliohippus\" was clearly a close relative of \"Equus\", its skull had deep facial fossae, whereas \"Equus\" had no fossae at all. Additionally, its teeth were strongly curved, unlike the very straight teeth of modern horses. Consequently, it is unlikely to be the ancestor of the modern horse; instead, it is a likely candidate for the ancestor of \"Astrohippus\".\n\n\"Dinohippus\" was the most common species of Equidae in North America during the late Pliocene. It was originally thought to be monodactyl, but a 1981 fossil find in Nebraska shows some were tridactyl.\n\n\"Plesippus\" is often considered an intermediate stage between \"Dinohippus\" and the extant genus, \"Equus\".\n\nThe famous fossils found near Hagerman, Idaho were originally thought to be a part of the genus \"Plesippus\". Hagerman Fossil Beds (Idaho) is a Pliocene site, dating to about 3.5 mya. The fossilized remains were originally called \"Plesippus shoshonensis\", but further study by paleontologists determined the fossils represented the oldest remains of the genus \"Equus\". Their estimated average weight was 425 kg, roughly the size of an Arabian horse.\n\nAt the end of the Pliocene, the climate in North America began to cool significantly and most of the animals were forced to move south. One population of \"Plesippus\" moved across the Bering land bridge into Eurasia around 2.5 mya.\n\nThe genus \"Equus\", which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from \"Dinohippus\", via the intermediate form \"Plesippus\". One of the oldest species is \"Equus simplicidens\", described as zebra-like with a donkey-shaped head. The oldest fossil to date is ~3.5 million years old from Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged \"Equus livenzovensis\" documented from western Europe and Russia.\n\nMolecular phylogenies indicate the most recent common ancestor of all modern equids (members of the genus \"Equus\") lived ~5.6 (3.9–7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 Myr BP. The oldest divergencies are the Asian hemiones (subgenus \"E. (Asinus)\", including the kulan, onager, and kiang), followed by the African zebras (subgenera \"E. (Dolichohippus)\", and \"E. (Hippotigris)\"). All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil Pliocene and Pleistocene forms) belong to the subgenus \"E. (Equus)\" which diverged ~4.8 (3.2–6.5) million years ago.\n\nPleistocene horse fossils have been assigned to a multitude of species, with over 50 species of equines described from the Pleistocene of North America alone, although the taxonomic validity of most of these has been called into question. Recent genetic work on fossils has found evidence for only three genetically divergent equid lineages in Pleistocene North and South America. These results suggest all North American fossils of caballine-type horses (which also include the domesticated horse and Przewalski's horse of Europe and Asia), as well as South American fossils traditionally placed in the subgenus \"E. (Amerhippus)\" belong to the same species: \"E. ferus\". Remains attributed to a variety of species and lumped as New World stilt-legged horses (including \"H. francisci\", \"E. tau\", \"E. quinni\" and potentially North American Pleistocene fossils previously attributed to \"E. cf. hemiones\", and \"E. (Asinus)\" cf. \"kiang\") probably all belong to a second species endemic to North America, which despite a superficial resemblance to species in the subgenus \"E. (Asinus)\" (and hence occasionally referred to as North American ass) is closely related to \"E. ferus\". Surprisingly, the third species, endemic to South America and traditionally referred to as \"Hippidion\", originally believed to be descended from \"Pliohippus\", was shown to be a third species in the genus \"Equus\", closely related to the New World stilt-legged horse. The temporal and regional variation in body size and morphological features within each lineage indicates extraordinary intraspecific plasticity. Such environment-driven adaptative changes would explain why the taxonomic diversity of Pleistocene equids has been overestimated on morphoanatomical grounds.\n\nAccording to these results, it appears the genus \"Equus\" evolved from a \"Dinohippus\"-like ancestor ~4–7 mya. It rapidly spread into the Old World and there diversified into the various species of asses and zebras. A North American lineage of the subgenus \"E. (Equus)\" evolved into the New World stilt-legged horse (NWSLH). Subsequently, populations of this species entered South America as part of the Great American Interchange shortly after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, and evolved into the form currently referred to as \"Hippidion\" ~2.5 million years ago. \"Hippidion\" is thus only distantly related to the morphologically similar \"Pliohippus\", which presumably became extinct during the Miocene. Both the NWSLH and \"Hippidium\" show adaptations to dry, barren ground, whereas the shortened legs of \"Hippidion\" may have been a response to sloped terrain. In contrast, the geographic origin of the closely related modern \"E. ferus\" is not resolved. However, genetic results on extant and fossil material of Pleistocene age indicate two clades, potentially subspecies, one of which had a holarctic distribution spanning from Europe through Asia and across North America and would become the founding stock of the modern domesticated horse. The other population appears to have been restricted to North America. However, one or more North American populations of \"E. ferus\" entered South America ~1.0–1.5 million years ago, leading to the forms currently known as \"E. (Amerhippus)\", which represent an extinct geographic variant or race of \"E. ferus\".\n\nIn June 2013, a group of researchers announced that they had sequenced the DNA of a 560–780 thousand year old horse, using material extracted from a leg bone found buried in permafrost in Canada's Yukon territory. Before this publication, the oldest nuclear genome that had been successfully sequenced was dated at 110–130 thousand years ago. For comparison, the researchers also sequenced the genomes of a 43,000-year-old Pleistocene horse, a Przewalski's horse, five modern horse breeds, and a donkey. Analysis of differences between these genomes indicated that the last common ancestor of modern horses, donkeys, and zebras existed 4 to 4.5 million years ago. The results also indicated that Przewalski's horse diverged from other modern types of horse about 43,000 years ago, and had never in its evolutionary history been domesticated.\n\nDigs in western Canada have unearthed clear evidence horses existed in North America until about 12,000 years ago.\nHowever, all Equidae in North America ultimately became extinct. The causes of this extinction (simultaneous with the extinctions of a variety of other American megafauna) have been a matter of debate. Given the suddenness of the event and because these mammals had been flourishing for millions of years previously, something quite unusual must have happened. The first main hypothesis attributes extinction to climate change. For example, in Alaska, beginning approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which was covered with unpalatable plants. The other hypothesis suggests extinction was linked to overexploitation by newly arrived humans of naive prey that were not habituated to their hunting methods. The extinctions were roughly simultaneous with the end of the most recent glacial advance and the appearance of the big game-hunting Clovis culture. Several studies have indicated humans probably arrived in Alaska at the same time or shortly before the local extinction of horses. Additionally, it has been proposed that the steppe-tundra vegetation transition in Beringia may have been a consequence, rather than a cause, of the extinction of megafaunal grazers.\n\nIn Eurasia, horse fossils began occurring frequently again in archaeological sites in Kazakhstan and the southern Ukraine about 6,000 years ago. From then on, domesticated horses, as well as the knowledge of capturing, taming, and rearing horses, probably spread relatively quickly, with wild mares from several wild populations being incorporated en route.\n\nHorses only returned to the Americas with Christopher Columbus in 1493. These were Iberian horses first brought to Hispaniola and later to Panama, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Argentina, and, in 1538, Florida. The first horses to return to the main continent were 16 specifically identified horses brought by Hernán Cortés. Subsequent explorers, such as Coronado and De Soto, brought ever-larger numbers, some from Spain and others from breeding establishments set up by the Spanish in the Caribbean. Later, as Spanish missions were founded on the mainland, horses would eventually be lost or stolen, and proliferated into large herds of feral horses that became known as mustangs.\n\nThe indigenous peoples of the Americas did not have a specific word for horses, and came to refer to them in various languages as a type of dog or deer (in one case, \"elk-dog\", in other cases \"big dog\" or \"seven dogs\", referring to the weight each animal could pull). \n\nThe ancestors of the horse came to walk only on the end of the third toe and both side toes. Skeletal remnants show obvious wear on the back of both sides of metacarpal and metatarsal bones, commonly called the \"splint bones\". They are the remnants of the second and the fourth toe. Modern horses retain the splint bones; they are often believed to be useless attachments, but they in fact play an important role in supporting the carpal joints (front knees) and even the tarsal joints (hocks).\n\nThroughout the phylogenetic development, the teeth of the horse underwent significant changes. The type of the original omnivorous teeth with short, \"bumpy\" molars, with which the prime members of the evolutionary line distinguished themselves, gradually changed into the teeth common to herbivorous mammals. They became long (as much as 100 mm), roughly cubical molars equipped with flat grinding surfaces. In conjunction with the teeth, during the horse's evolution, the elongation of the facial part of the skull is apparent, and can also be observed in the backward-set eyeholes. In addition, the relatively short neck of the equine ancestors became longer, with equal elongation of the legs. Finally, the size of the body grew as well.\n\nThe ancestral coat color of \"E. ferus\" was possible a uniform dun, consistent with modern populations of Przewalski's horses. Pre-domestication variants including black and spotted have been inferred from cave wall paintings and confirmed by genomic analysis.\nDomestication may have also led to more varieties of coat colors.\n\n"}

He is best known as chief manager of the Russian-American Company, in fact governor of the Russian settlements in present-day Alaska.\n\nIn English texts, \"Wrangel\" is sometimes spelled \"Vrangel\", a transliteration from Russian, which more closely represents its pronunciation in German, or \"Wrangell\".\n\nWrangel was born in Pskov, into the noble Baltic German Wrangel family. He graduated from the Naval Cadets College in 1815. He took part in Vasily Golovnin's world cruise on the ship \"Kamchatka\" in 1817–1819.\n\nHe was appointed in 1820 to command the Kolymskaya expedition to explore the Russian polar seas. Sailing from St. Petersburg, he arrived at Nizhnekolymsk on 2 November 1820, and early in 1821 journeyed to Cape Shelagskiy on sledges drawn by dogs. He sailed afterward up Kolyma River, advancing about 125 miles into the interior, through territory inhabited by the Yakuts. On 10 March 1822, he resumed his journey northward, and traveled 46 days on the ice, reaching 72° 2' north latitude. He left Nizhnekolymsk on 1 November 1823, and returned to St. Petersburg on 15 August 1824.\n\nHe established that north of the Kolyma River and Cape Shelagsky there was an open sea, not dry land, as people thought. Together with Fyodor Matyushkin and P. Kuzmin, Wrangel described the Siberian coastline from the Indigirka River to the Kolyuchinskaya Bay in the Chukchi Sea. (See Northeast Passage.) His expedition made a valuable research in glaciology, geomagnetics, and climatology and also collected data about natural resources and native population of that remote area.\n\nHaving been promoted to commander, Wrangel led the Russian world voyage on the ship \"Krotky\" in 1825–1827.\n\nHe was appointed chief manager of the Russian-American Company in 1829, effectively governor of its settlements in North America (present day Alaska). Wrangel was the first of a series of bachelor appointees to the office of governor who had to find a wife before assuming the duties in America, the Russian American Company rules having been changed in 1829. Prior to his departure for Russia's American colonies, he was married to Elisabeth Teodora Natalia Karolina de Rossillon, daughter of Baron Wilhelm de Rossillon.\n\nHe traveled to his post early in 1829, by way of Siberia and Kamchatka. After thoroughly reforming the administration, he introduced the cultivation of the potato, opened and regulated the working of several mines, and urged upon the home government the organization of a fur company. He promoted investment, and sent out missionaries. He began a survey of the country, opened roads, built bridges and government buildings. He made geographical and ethnographical observations, which he embodied in a memoir to the navy department. Recalled in 1834, he returned by way of the Isthmus of Panama and the United States, where he visited several cities.\n\nWrangel was promoted rear admiral in 1837, and made director of the ship-timber department in the navy office, which post he held for twelve years. He became vice-admiral in 1847, but resigned in 1849, and temporarily severed his connection with the navy to assume the presidency of the newly reorganized Russian-American Company. Wrangel had been a member of the board of directors of the Russian-American Company from 1840 to 1849.\n\nIn 1854 he re-entered active service and was made chief director of the hydrographical department of the navy. He was the Minister of the Navy 1855–1857.\n\nWrangel retired in 1864. He opposed the sale of Alaska to the United States in 1867. Wrangel wrote the book \"Journey along the northern coastline of Siberia and the Arctic Ocean\" and other books about the peoples of northwestern America.\n\nHe lived in his last years in Roela in the eastern part of Estonia. He had bought the manor in 1840. He died in Tartu, Livonia.\n\nAn account of the physical observations during his first journey was published in German (Berlin, 1827), and also in German extracts from Wrangel's journals, \"Reise laengs der Nordküste von Sibirien und auf dem Eismeere in den Jahren 1820-1824\" (2 vols., Berlin, 1839), which was translated into English as \"Wrangell's Expedition to the Polar Sea\" (2 vols., London, 1840). The complete report of the expedition appeared as \"Otceschewie do Sjewernym beregam Sibiri, po Ledowitomm More\" (2 vols., St. Petersburg, 1841), and was translated into French with notes by Prince Galitzin, under the title \"Voyage sur les côtes septentrionales de la Sibérie et de la mer glaciale\" (2 vols., 1841). From the French version of the complete report an English one was made under the title \"A Journey on the Northern Coast of Siberia and the Icy Sea\" (2 vols., London, 1841). The book influenced Charles Darwin's thinking on animal navigation, leading him to propose that humans and animals possess an innate ability for dead reckoning.

The account of the great flood was embedded in a narrative that also featured the Greek sun-myths and moon-myths.

It suggested that the Earth had been in a molten state, and features such as mountains formed as it cooled and shrank. As the interior of the Earth cooled and shrank, the rigid crust would have to shrink and crumple. The crumpling could produce features such as mountain ranges.\n\nThe Earth was compared to a cooling ball of iron, or a steam boiler with shifting boiler plates. By the early 1900s, it was known that temperature increased with increasing depth. With the thickness of the crust, the \"boiler plates\", being estimated at ten to fifty miles, the downward pressure would be hundreds of thousands of pounds per square inch. Although groundwater was expected to turn to steam at a great depth, usually the downward pressure would contain any steam. Steam's effect upon molten rock was suspected of being a cause of volcanoes and earthquakes, as it had been noticed that most volcanoes are near water. It was not clear whether the molten rock from volcanoes had its origin in the molten rock under the crust, or if increased heat due to pressure under mountains caused the rock to melt. One of the reasons for volcanoes was as a way in which \"the contracting earth disposes of the matter it can no longer contain.\" A relationship between earthquakes and volcanoes had been noted, although the causes were not known. Fault lines and earthquakes tended to happen along the boundaries of the shifting \"boiler plates\", but the folding of mountains indicated that sometimes the plates buckled.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Professor Eduard Suess used the theory to explain the 1908 Messina earthquake, being of the opinion that the Earth's crust was gradually shrinking everywhere. He also predicted that eruptions would follow the earthquake and tsunami in Southern Italy. He attributed the earthquake to the sinking of the Earth's crust, in the zone of which the Aeolian Islands are the center. He declared that as the process of sinking went on, the Calabrian and Sicilian highlands on either side of the Straits of Messina would be submerged, only the highest peaks remaining above the sea. The strait, he said, would thereby be greatly widened.\n\nSimilarly, Professor Robert T. Hill explained at that time that \"the rocks are being folded, fractured and otherwise broken or deformed by the great shrinking and settling of the earth's crust as a whole. The contraction of the earth's sphere is the physical shrinkage of age that is measured in aeons instead of years. The prehistoric convulsions of the earth before man inhabited this planet were terrific, almost inconceivable.\" There \"was no doubt that earthquakes are diminishing.\" The displacement of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake was only a few feet, while prehistoric earthquakes made fissures and slides of 20,000 feet.\nThe Pacific Ring of Fire had been noticed, as well as a second earthquake belt which went through:\n\nA contracting Earth served as framework for Leopold Kober and Hans Stille who worked on geosyncline theory in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nSome of the objections include:\n\nThis theory is now disproven and considered obsolete. In contrast to Earth, however, global cooling remains the dominant explanation for scarp (cliff) features on the planet Mercury. After resumption of Lunar exploration in the 1990s, it was discovered there are scarps across the Moon's surface which are caused by contraction due to cooling.\n\n"}

An example is the large pothole found in Archbald, Pennsylvania, in Archbald Pothole State Park.\n\nGiant's kettles are formed while a bedrock surface is covered by a glacier. Water, produced by the thawing of the ice and snow, forms streams on the surface of the glacier, which, having gathered into their courses a certain amount of morainic debris, finally flow down a crevasse as a swirling cascade or moulin. The sides of the crevasse are abraded, and a vertical shaft is formed in the ice. The erosion may be continued into the bed of the glacier; and, the ice having left the district, the giant's kettle so formed is seen as an empty shaft, or as a pipe filled with gravel, sand, or boulders. Such cavities and pipes afford valuable evidence as to the former extent of glaciers.\n\nSimilar potholes are encountered in riverbeds and the Channeled Scablandss scoured by glacial outburst floods.\n\nThe GletscherGarten of Lucerne (Switzerland) is famous for its giant's kettles, having 32 in number, the largest being wide and deep.

{"id": "1692666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1692666", "title": "History of Animals", "text": "History of Animals\n\nHistory of Animals (, \"Ton peri ta zoia historion\", \"Inquiries on Animals\"; \"History of Animals\") is one of the major texts on biology by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who had studied at Plato's Academy in Athens. It was written in the fourth century BC; Aristotle died in 322 BC.\n\nGenerally seen as a pioneering work of zoology, Aristotle frames his text by explaining that he is investigating the \"what\" (the existing facts about animals) prior to establishing the \"why\" (the causes of these characteristics). The book is thus an attempt to apply philosophy to part of the natural world. Throughout the work, Aristotle seeks to identify differences, both between individuals and between groups. A group is established when it is seen that all members have the same set of distinguishing features; for example, that all birds have feathers, wings, and beaks. This relationship between the birds and their features is recognized as a universal.\n\nThe \"History of Animals\" contains many accurate eye-witness observations, in particular of the marine biology around the island of Lesbos, such as that the octopus had colour-changing abilities and a sperm-transferring tentacle, that the young of a dogfish grow inside their mother's body, or that the male of a river catfish guards the eggs after the female has left. Some of these were long considered fanciful before being rediscovered in the nineteenth century. Aristotle has been accused of making errors, but some are due to misinterpretation of his text, and others may have been based on genuine observation. He did however make somewhat uncritical use of evidence from other people, such as travellers and beekeepers.\n\nThe \"History of Animals\" had a powerful influence on zoology for some two thousand years. It continued to be a primary source of knowledge until in the sixteenth century zoologists including Conrad Gessner, all influenced by Aristotle, wrote their own studies of the subject.\n\nAristotle (384–322 BC) studied at Plato's Academy in Athens, remaining there for some 17 years. Like Plato, he sought universals in his philosophy, but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed observation, notably of the natural history of the island of Lesbos and the marine life in the island's lagoon at Pyrrha. This study made him the earliest natural historian whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on zoology was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, \"Enquiry into Plants\".\n\nIn the \"History of Animals\", Aristotle sets out to investigate the existing facts (Greek \"hoti\", what), prior to establishing their causes (Greek \"dioti\", why). The book is thus a defence of his method of investigating zoology. Aristotle investigates four types of differences between animals: differences in particular body parts (Books I to IV); differences in ways of life and types of activity (Books V, VI, VII and IX); and differences in specific characters (Book VIII).\n\nTo illustrate the philosophical method, consider one grouping of many kinds of animal, 'birds': all members of this group possess the same distinguishing features—feathers, wings, beaks, and two bony legs. This is an instance of a universal: if something is a bird, it will have feathers and wings; if something has feathers and wings, that also implies it is a bird, so the reasoning here is bidirectional. On the other hand, some animals that have red blood have lungs; other red-blooded animals (such as fish) have gills. This implies, in Aristotle's reasoning, that if something has lungs, it has red blood; but Aristotle is careful not to imply that all red-blooded animals have lungs, so the reasoning here is not bidirectional.\n\nBook I The grouping of animals and the parts of the human body. Aristotle describes the parts that the human body is made of, such as the skull, brain, face, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, thorax, belly, heart, viscera, genitalia, and limbs.\n\nBook II The different parts of red-blooded animals. Aristotle writes about limbs, the teeth of dogs, horses, man, and elephant; the elephant's tongue; and of animals such as the apes, crocodile, chameleon, birds especially the wryneck, fishes and snakes.\n\nBook III The internal organs, including generative system, veins, sinews, bone etc. He moves on to the blood, bone marrow, milk including rennet and cheese, and semen.\n\nBook IV Animals without blood (invertebrates) – cephalopods, crustaceans, etc. In chapter 8, he describes the sense organs of animals. Chapter 10 considers sleep and whether it occurs in fish.\n\nBooks V and VI Reproduction, spontaneous and sexual of marine invertebrates, birds, quadrupeds, snakes, fish, and terrestrial arthropods including ichneumon wasps, bees, ants, scorpions, spiders, and grasshoppers.\n\nBook VII Reproduction of man, including puberty, conception, pregnancy, lactation, the embryo, labour, milk, and diseases of infants.\n\nBook VIII The character and habits of animals, food, migration, health, animal diseases including bee parasites, and the influence of climate.\n\nBook IX Social behaviour in animals; signs of intelligence in animals such as sheep and birds.\n\nA Book X is included in some versions, dealing with the causes of barrenness in women, but is generally regarded as not being by Aristotle. In the preface to his translation, D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson calls it \"spurious beyond question\".\n\nThe \"History of Animals\" contains a large number of eye-witness observations, in particular of marine biology, in sharp contrast to Plato's \"symbolic zoology\". Aristotle's style and precision can be seen in the passage where he discusses the behaviour and anatomy of the cephalopods, mentioning the use of ink against predators, camouflage, and signalling. This is D'Arcy Thompson's translation:\n\nHis observations were almost all accurate, according to the philosopher Anthony Preus, though Mario Vegetti argues that Aristotle sometimes let theory cloud observation.\n\nSome of Aristotle's observations were not taken seriously by science until they were independently rediscovered in the 19th century. For example, he recorded that male octopuses have a hectocotylus, a tentacle which stores sperm and which can transfer it into the female's body; sometimes it snaps off during mating. The account was dismissed as fanciful until the French naturalist Georges Cuvier described it in his 1817 \"Le Règne Animal\". Aristotle also noted that the young of the dogfish grow inside their mother's body attached by a cord to something like a placenta (a yolk sac). This was confirmed in 1842 by the German zoologist Johannes Peter Müller. Aristotle noted, too, that a river catfish which he called the \"glanis\" cares for its young, as the female leaves after giving birth; the male guards the eggs for forty or fifty days, chasing off small fish which threaten the eggs, and making a murmuring noise. The Swiss American zoologist Louis Agassiz found the account to be correct in 1890.\n\nAristotle's methods of observation included dissection (Aristotle's lost companion work, \"The Dissections\", contained illustrations of these), so he observed animal anatomy directly, though his interpretations of the functions of the structures he observed were subject to error. Like other classical authors such as Pliny the Elder, Aristotle also gathered evidence from travellers and people with specialised knowledge, such as fishermen and beekeepers, without much attempt to corroborate what they said.\n\nThe text contains some claims that appear to be errors. Aristotle asserted that the females of any species have a smaller number of teeth than the males. This apparently readily falsifiable claim could have been a genuine observation, if as Robert Mayhew suggests women at that time had a poorer diet than men; but the claim is not true of other species either. Thus, Philippa Lang argues, Aristotle may have been empirical, but he was quite laissez-faire about observation, \"because [he] was not expecting nature to be misleading\".\n\nIn other cases, errors may have been wrongly attributed to Aristotle. Katrin Weigmann wrote \"[Aristotle's] statement that flies have four legs was repeated in natural history texts for more than a thousand years despite the fact that a little counting would have proven otherwise.\" However, the historian and philosopher of biology John S. Wilkins notes that Aristotle did not say \"all flies have four legs\"; he wrote that one particular animal, the \"ephemeron\" or mayfly, \"moves with four feet and four wings: and, I may observe in passing, this creature is exceptional not only in regard to the duration of its existence, whence it receives its name, but also because though a quadruped it has wings also.\" Mayflies do in fact walk on four legs, the front pair not being adapted for walking, so, Wilkins concludes, Aristotle was correct.\n\nThe Arabic translation comprises treatises 1–10 of the \"Kitāb al-Hayawān\" (\"The Book of Animals\"). It was known to the Arab philosopher Al-Kindī (d. 850) and commented on by Avicenna among others. It was in turn translated into Latin, along with Ibn Rushd (Averroes)'s commentary on it, by Michael Scot in the early 13th century.\n\nEnglish translations were made by Richard Cresswell in 1862 and by the zoologist D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson in 1910.\n\nA French translation was made by Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire in 1883. Another translation into French was made by J. Tricot in 1957, following D'Arcy Thompson's interpretation.\n\nA German translation of books I–VIII was made by Anton Karsch, starting in 1866. A translation of all ten books into German was made by Paul Gohlke in 1949.\n\nThe comparative anatomist Richard Owen said in 1837 that \"Zoological Science sprang from [Aristotle's] labours, we may almost say, like Minerva from the Head of Jove, in a state of noble and splendid maturity\".\n\nBen Waggoner of the University of California Museum of Paleontology wrote that\n\nWalter Pagel comments that Aristotle \"perceptibly influenced\" the founders of modern zoology, the Swiss Conrad Gessner with his 1551–1558 \"Historiae animalium\", the Italian Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522–1605), the French Guillaume Rondelet (1507–1566), and the Dutch Volcher Coiter (1534–1576), while his methods of looking at time series and making use of comparative anatomy assisted the Englishman William Harvey in his 1651 work on embryology.\n\nArmand Marie Leroi's 2014 book \"The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science\" and BBC documentary \"Aristotle's Lagoon\" set Aristotle's biological writings including the \"History of Animals\" in context, and propose an interpretation of his biological theories.\n\n"}
{"id": "422737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=422737", "title": "Island arc", "text": "Island arc\n\nAn island arc is a type of archipelago, often composed of a chain of volcanoes, with arc-shaped alignment, situated parallel and close to a boundary between two converging tectonic plates.\n\nMost of these island arcs are formed as one oceanic tectonic plate subducts another one and, in most cases, produces magma at depths below the over-riding plate. However, this is only true for those island arcs that are part of the group of mountain belts which are called volcanic arcs, a term which is used when all the elements of the arc-shaped mountain belt are composed of volcanoes. For example, large parts of the Andes-Central American-Canadian mountain chain may be known as a volcanic arc, but they are not islands (being situated upon and along a continental area) and are thus not classified as an island arc. On the other hand, the Aegean or Hellenic arc in the Mediterranean area, composed of numerous islands such as Crete, is an island arc, but is not volcanic. Parallel to it is the South Aegean Volcanic Arc, which is the volcanic island arc of the same tectonic system.\n\nThere is some debate about the usefulness of the distinction between island arcs and volcanic arcs. The term \"volcanic island arc\" is merely a sub-classification of \"island arc.\" Island arcs are tectonically created arc-shaped mountain belts that are partly below sea level. Essentially, they represent a specific geographic-topographic situation in which a mountain belt is partly submerged in ocean. Many of these are composed of volcanoes, and can thus be further classified as volcanic island arcs.\n\nIn the subduction zone, the dehydration of the subducting slab releases volatiles into the overriding mantle wedge. The addition of volatile components (e.g., water) induces partial melting by lowering the solidus of the wedge. This process, called flux melting, generates varying degrees of calc-alkaline magma that buoyantly rises to intrude and be extruded through the lithosphere of the overriding plate. The resulting volcano chain has the shape of an arc parallel to the convergent plate boundary and convex toward the subducting plate. One of the theories to explain the arc shape views this as a consequence of the geometry of the spherical plate crumpling along a line on a spherical surface, but only the more broadly shaped arcs can be explained in this way.\n\nOn the subducting side of the island arc is a deep and narrow oceanic trench, which is the trace at the Earth’s surface of the boundary between the downgoing and overriding plates. This trench is created by the gravitational pull of the relatively dense subducting plate pulling the leading edge of the plate downward. Multiple earthquakes occur along this subduction boundary with the seismic hypocenters located at increasing depth under the island arc: these quakes define the Wadati–Benioff zones.\n\nOcean basins that are being reduced by subduction are called 'remnant oceans' as they will slowly be shrunken out of existence and crushed in the subsequent orogenic collision. This process has happened repeatedly in the geological history of the Earth.\n\nRemains of former island arcs have been identified at some locations. The table below mention a selection of these. \n\n"}

While Hoyle himself was an atheist, the argument has since become a mainstay of creationist and intelligent design criticisms of evolution.\n\nThis argument is rejected by the vast majority of biologists. From the modern evolutionary standpoint, while the odds of the sudden construction of higher lifeforms are indeed improbably remote, evolution proceeds in many smaller stages, each driven by natural selection rather than by chance, over a long period of time. The transition as a whole is plausible, as each step improves survivability; the Boeing 747 was not designed in a single unlikely burst of creativity, and modern lifeforms were not constructed in one single unlikely event, as the junkyard tornado posits.\n\nAccording to Fred Hoyle's analysis, the probability of cellular life's arising from non-living matter (abiogenesis) was about one-in-10. He commented:\n\nThis echoes his stance, reported elsewhere:\n\nHoyle used this to argue in favor of panspermia, that the origin of life on earth was from preexisting life in space.\n\nThe junkyard tornado derives from arguments most popular in the 1920s, prior to the modern evolutionary synthesis, which are rejected by evolutionary biologists. A preliminary step is to establish that the phase space containing some biological entity (such as humans, working cells, or the eye) is enormous, something not contentious. The argument is then to infer from the huge size of the phase space that the probability that the entity could appear by chance is exceedingly low, ignoring the key process involved, natural selection.\n\nSometimes, arguments invoking the junkyard tornado analogy also invoke Borel's Law, which claims that highly improbable events do not occur. The usual argument against Borel's \"Law\" is that if \"all\" possible outcomes of a natural process are highly improbable when taken individually, then a highly improbable outcome is certain. The true law being referenced is actually the Strong Law of large numbers, but creationists have taken a simple statement made by Borel in books written late in his life concerning probability theory and called this statement Borel's Law.\n\nThis \"Borel's Law\" is actually the universal probability bound, which when applied to evolution is axiomatically incorrect. The universal probability bound assumes that the event one is trying to measure is completely random, and some use this argument to prove that evolution could not possibly occur, since its probability would be much less than that of the universal probability bound. This, however, is fallacious, given that evolution is not a completely random effect (genetic drift), but rather proceeds with the aid of natural selection.\n\nThe junkyard tornado is also applied to cellular biochemistry. This is comparable to the older infinite monkey theorem but instead of the works of William Shakespeare, the claim is that the probability that a protein molecule could achieve a functional sequence of amino acids is too low to be realised by chance alone. The argument conflates the difference between the complexity that arises from living organisms that are able to reproduce themselves (and as such may evolve under natural selection to become better adapted and perhaps more complex over time) with the complexity of inanimate objects, unable to pass on any reproductive changes (such as the multitude of parts manufactured in Boeing 747). The comparison breaks down because of this important distinction.\n\nAccording to Ian Musgrave in \"Lies, Damned Lies, Statistics, and Probability of Abiogenesis Calculations\":\nThe junkyard tornado argument is rejected by evolutionary biologists, since, as the late John Maynard Smith pointed out, \"no biologist imagines that complex structures arise in a single step.\" Evolutionary biology explains how complex cellular structures evolved by analysing the intermediate steps required for precellular life. It is these intermediate steps that are omitted in creationist arguments, which is the cause of their overestimating of the improbability of the entire process.\n\nHoyle's argument is a mainstay of creationist, intelligent design, orthogenetic and other criticisms of evolution. It has been labeled a fallacy by Richard Dawkins in his two books \"The Blind Watchmaker\" and \"Climbing Mount Improbable\". Dawkins argues that the existence of God, who under theistic uses of Hoyle's argument is implicitly responsible for the origin of life, defies probability far more than does the spontaneous origin of life even given Hoyle's assumptions, with Dawkins detailing his counter-argument in \"The God Delusion\", describing God as the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit.\n\n\n"}

Whereas England had its Areas of Search based on 46 counties, those in Wales were based on a combination of the counties and smaller districts.

The expression appears in several equations in special relativity, and it arises in derivations of the Lorentz transformations. The name originates from its earlier appearance in Lorentzian electrodynamics – named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz.\n\nDue to its ubiquity, it is generally denoted \"γ\" (the Greek lowercase letter gamma). Sometimes (especially in discussion of superluminal motion) the factor is written as \"Γ\" (Greek uppercase-gamma) rather than \"γ\".\n\nThe Lorentz factor \"γ\" is defined as\nwhere:\n\nThis is the most frequently used form in practice, though not the only one (see below for alternative forms).\n\nTo complement the definition, some authors define the reciprocal\nsee velocity addition formula.\n\nFollowing is a list of formulae from Special relativity which use \"γ\" as a shorthand:\nCorollaries of the above transformations are the results:\n\nApplying conservation of momentum and energy leads to these results:\n\nIn the table below, the left-hand column shows speeds as different fractions of the speed of light (i.e. in units of \"c\"). The middle column shows the corresponding Lorentz factor, the final is the reciprocal. Values in bold are exact.\n\nThere are other ways to write the factor. Above, velocity \"v\" was used, but related variables such as momentum and rapidity may also be convenient.\n\nSolving the previous relativistic momentum equation for \"γ\" leads to\nThis form is rarely used, although it does appear in the Maxwell–Jüttner distribution.\n\nApplying the definition of rapidity as the hyperbolic angle formula_12:\nalso leads to \"γ\" (by use of hyperbolic identities):\n\nUsing the property of Lorentz transformation, it can be shown that rapidity is additive, a useful property that velocity does not have. Thus the rapidity parameter forms a one-parameter group, a foundation for physical models.\n\nThe Lorentz factor has the Maclaurin series:\nwhich is a special case of a binomial series.\n\nThe approximation \"γ\" ≈ 1 + \"β\" may be used to calculate relativistic effects at low speeds. It holds to within 1% error for \"v\" < 0.4 c (\"v\" < 120,000 km/s), and to within 0.1% error for \"v\" < 0.22 \"c\" (\"v\" < 66,000 km/s).\n\nThe truncated versions of this series also allow physicists to prove that special relativity reduces to Newtonian mechanics at low speeds. For example, in special relativity, the following two equations hold:\n\nFor \"γ\" ≈ 1 and \"γ\" ≈ 1 + \"β\", respectively, these reduce to their Newtonian equivalents:\n\nThe Lorentz factor equation can also be inverted to yield\nThis has an asymptotic form \n\nThe first two terms are occasionally used to quickly calculate velocities from large \"γ\" values. The approximation \"β\" ≈ 1 − \"γ\" holds to within 1% tolerance for \"γ\" > 2, and to within 0.1% tolerance for \"γ\" > 3.5.\n\nThe standard model of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) holds that these explosions are ultra-relativistic (initial formula_7 greater than approximately 100), which is invoked to explain the so-called \"compactness\" problem: absent this ultra-relativistic expansion, the ejecta would be optically thick to pair production at typical peak spectral energies of a few 100 keV, whereas the prompt emission is observed to be non-thermal.\n\nSubatomic particles called muons, have a relatively high lorentz factor and therefore experience extreme time dilation. As an example, muons generally have a half-life of about which means muons generated from cosmic ray collisions at about 10 km up in the atmosphere should be non-detectable on the ground due to their decay rate. However, it has been found that ~10% of muons are still detected on the surface, thereby proving that to be detectable they have had their decay rates slow down relative to our inertial frame of reference.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16936683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16936683", "title": "Marxian class theory", "text": "Marxian class theory\n\nMarxian class theory asserts that an individual’s position within a class hierarchy is determined by his or her role in the production process, and argues that political and ideological consciousness is determined by class position. A class is those who share common economic interests, are conscious of those interests, and engage in collective action which advances those interests. Within Marxian class theory, the structure of the production process forms the basis of class construction.\n\nTo Marx, a class is a group with intrinsic tendencies and interests that differ from those of other groups within society, the basis of a fundamental antagonism between such groups. For example, it is in the laborer's best interest to maximize wages and benefits and in the capitalist's best interest to maximize profit at the expense of such, leading to a contradiction within the capitalist system, even if the laborers and capitalists themselves are unaware of the clash of interests.\n\nMarxian class theory has been open to a range of alternate positions, most notably from scholars such as E. P. Thompson and Mario Tronti. Both Thompson and Tronti suggest class consciousness within the production process precedes the formation of productive relationships. In this sense, Marxian class theory often relates to discussion over pre-existing class struggles.\n\nKarl Marx's class theory derives from a range of philosophical schools of thought including left Hegelianism, Scottish Empiricism, and Anglo-French political-economics. Marx's view of class originated from a series of personal interests relating to social alienation and human struggle, whereby the formation of class structure relates to acute historical consciousness. Political-economics also contributed to Marx's theories, centering on the concept of \"origin of income\" where society is divided into three sub-groups: Rentier, Capitalist, and Worker. This construction is based on David Ricardo's theory of capitalism. Marx strengthened this with a discussion over verifiable class relationships.\n\nMarx sought to define class as embedded in productive relations rather than social status. His political and economic thought developed towards an interest in production as opposed to distribution, and this henceforth became a central theme in his concept of class.\n\nMarx distinguishes one class from another on the basis of two criteria: ownership of the means of production and control of the labor power of others. From this, Marx states \"Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other\":\n\nI. Capitalists, or bourgeoisie, own the means of production and purchase the labor power of others\n\nII. Workers, or proletariat, do not own any means of production or the ability to purchase the labor power of others. Rather, they sell their own labor power.\n\nClass is thus determined by property relations, not by income or status. These factors are determined by distribution and consumption, which mirror the production and power relations of classes.\n\nThe Manifesto of the Communist Party describes two additional classes that “decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry”:\n\niii. A small, transitional class known as the petite bourgeoisie own sufficient means of production but do not purchase labor power. Marx's Communist Manifesto fails to properly define the petite bourgeoisie beyond “smaller capitalists” (Marx and Engels, 1848, 25).\n\niv. The “dangerous class”, or Lumpenproletariat, “the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of the old society.”\n\n\"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles… Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstruction of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes... The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.” – Communist Manifesto\n\nMarx established conflict as the key driving force of history and the main determinant of social trajectories (Kingston). However, in order to understand the nature of “class conflict,” we must first understand that such conflict arises from a unified class interest, also known as class consciousness. Class consciousness is an aspect of Marxist theory, referring to the self-awareness of social classes, the capacity to act in its own rational interests, or measuring the extent to which an individual is conscious of the historical tasks their class (or class allegiance) sets for them.\n\nMoreover, by definition, the objective interests of classes are fundamentally in opposition; consequently, these opposing interests and consciousnesses eventually lead to class conflict.\n\nMarx first saw the development of class conflict confined to individual factories and capitalists. However, given the maturation of capitalism, the life conditions of bourgeoisie and proletariat began to grow more disparate. This increased polarization and homogenization within classes fostered an environment for individual struggles to become more generalized. When increasing class conflict is manifested at the societal level, class consciousness and common interests are also increased. Consequently, when class consciousness is augmented, policies are organized to ensure the duration of such interest for the ruling class. Here begins the use of the struggle for political power and classes become political forces.\n\nSince the distribution of political power is determined by power over production, or power over capital, it is no surprise that the bourgeois class uses their wealth to legitimatize and protect their property and consequent social relations. Thus the ruling class is those who hold the economic power and make the decisions (Dahrendorf).\n\nIn Marxist theory, the capitalist stage of production consists of two main classes: the bourgeoisie, the capitalists who own the means of production, and the much larger proletariat (or 'working class') who must sell their own labour power (See also: wage labour). This is the fundamental economic structure of work and property (See also: wage labour), a state of inequality that is normalised and reproduced through cultural ideology. Thus the proletariat, in itself, is forced into a subservient position by the power of capital, which has stripped the means of production from them. As the proletariat becomes conscious of its situation and power, organizes itself, and takes collective political action it becomes a class for itself which has the revolutionary potential to become the ruling class.\n\nMax Weber critiqued historical materialism, positing that stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities but on other status and power differentials. Social class pertaining broadly to material wealth may be distinguished from status class based on honour, prestige, religious affiliation, and so on. The conditions of capitalism and its class system came together due to a variety of \"elective affinities\". \n\nMarxists explain the history of \"civilized\" societies in terms of a war of classes between those who control production and those who produce the goods or services in society. In the Marxist view of capitalism, this is a conflict between capitalists (bourgeoisie) and wage-workers (the proletariat). For Marxists, class antagonism is rooted in the situation that control over social production necessarily entails control over the class which produces goods—in capitalism this is the exploitation of workers by the bourgeoisie.\n\nMarx himself argued that it was the goal of the proletariat itself to displace the capitalist system with socialism, changing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future communist society in which: \"..the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.\" (Communist Manifesto) This would mark the beginning of a classless society in which human needs rather than profit would be motive for production. In a society with democratic control and production for use, there would be no class, no state and no need for money.\n\nFor Marx, class has three primary facets:\n\nThe first criterion divides a society into the owners and non-owners of means of production. In capitalism, these are capitalist (bourgeoisie) and proletariat. Finer divisions can be made, however: the most important subgroup in capitalism being petite bourgeoisie (small bourgeoisie), people who possess their own means of production but utilize it primarily by working on it themselves rather than hiring others to work on it. They include self-employed artisans, small shopkeepers, and many professionals. Jon Elster has found mention in Marx of 15 classes from various historical periods.\n\nVladimir Lenin has defined classes as \"large groups of people differing from each other by the place they occupy in a historically determined system of social production, by their relation (in most cases fixed and formulated in law) to the means of production, by their role in the social organization of labor, and, consequently, by the dimensions of the share of social wealth of which they dispose and the mode of acquiring it.\" \n\nThe most important transformation of society for Marxists has been the massive and rapid growth of the proletariat over the last two hundred and fifty years. Starting with agricultural and domestic textile laborers in England and Flanders, more and more occupations only provide a living through wages or salaries. Private manufacturing, leading to self-employment, is no longer as viable as it was before the industrial revolution, because automation made manufacturing very cheap. Many people who once controlled their own labor-time were converted into proletarians through industrialization. Today groups which in the past subsisted on stipends or private wealth—like doctors, academics or lawyers—are now increasingly working as wage laborers. Marxists call this process proletarianization, and point to it as the major factor in the proletariat being the largest class in current societies in the rich countries of the \"first world.\"\n\nMarx assumes the inevitability of the revolution of capitalist society into socialist society because of eventual discontent. The socialization of labor, in the growth of large-scale production, capitalist interest groups and organizations, as well as in the enormous increase in the dimensions and power of finance capital provides the principal material foundation for the unavoidable arrival of socialism. The physical, intellectual and moral perpetrator of this transformation is the proletariat. The proletariat's struggle against the bourgeoisie inevitably becomes a political struggle with the goal of political conquest by the proletariat. With the domination of the proletariat, the socialization of production cannot help but lead to the means of production to become the property of society. The direct consequences of this transformation are a drop in labor productivity, a shorter working day, and the replacement of small-scale unified production by collective and improved labor conditions. \nCapitalism breaks for all time the ties between producer and owner, once held by the bond of class conflict. Now a new union will be formed based on the conscious application of science and the concentration of collective labor.\n\nHe also extended this redistribution to the structure of power in families. Marx imagined that with socialism women’s status would increase, leading to the break-up of the patriarchal family...\n\n\"Modern industry, by assigning as it does, an important part in the socially organized process of production, outside the domestic sphere, to women, to young persons, and to children of both sexes, creates a new economic foundation for a higher form of the family and of the relations between the sexes… Moreover, it is obvious that the fact of the collective working group being composed of individuals of both sexes and all ages, must necessarily, under suitable conditions, become a source of human development; although in its spontaneously developed, brutal, capitalistic form, where the laborer exists for the process of production, and not the process of production for the laborer, that fact is a pestiferous source of corruption and slavery.\" (Capital, Vol. I, Chapter 13).\n\nMarxism has a rather heavily defined dialectic between objective factors (i.e., material conditions, the social structure) and subjective factors (i.e. the conscious organization of class members). While most forms of Marxism analyses people's class based on objective factors (class structure), major Marxist trends have made greater use of subjective factors in understanding the history of the working class. E.P. Thompson's \"The Making of the English Working Class\" is a definitive example of this \"subjective\" Marxist trend. Thompson analyses the English working class as a group of people with shared material conditions coming to a positive self-consciousness of their social position. This feature of social class is commonly termed class consciousness in Marxism, a concept which became famous with Georg Lukács' \"History and Class Consciousness\" (1923). It is seen as the process of a \"class in itself\" moving in the direction of a \"class for itself\", a collective agent that changes history rather than simply being a victim of the historical process. In Lukács' words, the proletariat was the \"subject–object of history\", and the first class which could separate false consciousness (inherent to the bourgeois's consciousness), which reified economic laws as universal (whereas they are only a consequence of historic capitalism).\n\nGlobalization theorists, such as William I. Robinson, Leslie Sklair, Kees Van Der Pijl, and Jerry Harris, argue that today a transnational capitalist class has emerged.\n\n\n"}

Averaging above sea level, it extends from the United States border in the north to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in the south, and is bounded by the and to the west and east, respectively.\n\nA low east-west mountain range in the state of Zacatecas divides the plateau into northern and southern sections. These two sections, called the Northern Plateau () and Central Plateau (), are now generally regarded by geographers as sections of one plateau.\n\nThe Mexican Plateau is mostly covered by deserts and xeric shrublands, with pine-oak forests covering the surrounding mountain ranges and forming sky islands on some of the interior ranges. The Mexican Altiplano is one of six distinct physiographic sections of the Basin and Range Province, which in turn is part of the Intermontane Plateaus physiographic division.\n\nIn phytogeography, the Sonoran Desert is within the Sonoran Floristic Province of the Madrean Region in southwestern North America, part of the Holarctic Kingdom of the northern Western Hemisphere.\n\nWhile the plateau stretches from north to south, the southern east-west arc of the Central Mexican Plateau from Jalisco to Veracruz states historically as well as today has served as the population nexus of the Mexican nation, it is home to its biggest metro areas of Guadalajara, Leon, Querétaro, Morelia, Mexico City, Toluca, Cuernavaca, and Puebla.\n\nThe Mesa del Norte or northern plateau averages in elevation above mean sea level and extends south from the Rio Grande (Río Bravo del Norte) through the states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Zacatecas and San Luis Potosí. Various narrow, isolated ridges cross the Mesa del Norte and numerous depressions also dot the region, the largest of which is the Bolsón de Mapimí. The Río Bravo del Norte and its tributary, the Río Conchos, drain portions of the northern plateau, and the Río Pánuco and its tributaries drain the southeastern corner. Both drain to the Gulf of Mexico. Much of the northern plateau comprises internal drainage basins that do not drain to the sea. The Chihuahuan Desert extends across the northern portion of the northern plateau, while the Meseta Central matorral covers the central portion, and the Central Mexican matorral extends from the southern portion of the northern plateau across the southern plateau.\n\nThe Mesa Central or southern plateau is higher than its northern counterpart, averaging in elevation. The southern plateau contains numerous valleys originally formed by ancient lakes. It extends across the states of Aguascalientes, Jalisco, Zacatecas, Guanajuato, Querétaro, Michoacán. Several of Mexico's most prominent cities, including Guadalajara, are located in the valleys of the southern plateau. Much of the southern plateau is drained by the Río Grande de Santiago and its tributaries, including the Río Lerma, which drain west into the Pacific Ocean. Tributaries of the Río Pánuco drain the eastern portion of the southern plateau. The Central Mexican matorral covers much of the southern plateau, with the subtropical Bajío dry forests occupying the lower portions of the Lerma–Río Grande de Santiago basin. Higher altitudes are covered by Mixed Forests, then Temperate Coniferous Forests, up to the snow line in the top of the volcanoes that surround the southern and western edges.\n\n"}
{"id": "14272151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14272151", "title": "Nature religion", "text": "Nature religion\n\nA nature religion is a religious movement that believes nature and the natural world is an embodiment of divinity, sacredness or spiritual power. Nature religions include indigenous religions practiced in various parts of the world by cultures who consider the environment to be imbued with spirits and other sacred entities. It also includes contemporary Pagan faiths which are primarily concentrated in Europe and North America.\n\nThe term \"nature religion\" was first coined by the American religious studies scholar Catherine Albanese, who used it in her work \"Nature Religion in America: From the Algonkian Indians to the New Age\" (1991) and later went on to use it in other studies. Following on from Albanese's development of the term it has since been used by other academics working in the discipline.\n\nCatherine Albanese described nature religion as \"a symbolic center and the cluster of beliefs, behaviours, and values that encircles it\", deeming it to be useful for shining a light on aspects of history that are rarely viewed as religious.\nIn a paper of his on the subject, the Canadian religious studies scholar Peter Beyer described \"nature religion\" as a \"useful analytical abstraction\" to refer to \"any religious belief or practice in which devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use\". He went on to note that in this way nature religion was not an \"identifiable religious tradition\" such as Buddhism or Christianity are, but that it instead covers \"a range of religious and quasi-religious movements, groups and social networks whose participants may or may not identify with one of the many constructed religions of global society which referred to many other nature religion.\"\n\nPeter Beyer noted the existence of a series of common characteristics which he believed were shared by different nature religions. He remarked that although \"one must be careful not to overgeneralise\", he suspected that there were a series of features which \"occur sufficiently often\" in those nature religions known to recorded scholarship to constitute a pattern.\n\nThe first of these common characteristics was nature religion's \"comparative resistance to institutionalisation and legitimisation in terms of identifiable socio-religious authorities and organisations\", meaning that nature religionists rarely formed their religious beliefs into large, visible socio-political structures such as churches. Furthermore, Beyer noted, nature religionists often held a \"concomitant distrust of and even eschewing of politically orientated power\". Instead of this, he felt that among nature religious communities, there was \"a valuing of community as non-hierarchical\" and a \"conditional optimism with regard to human capacity and the future.\"\n\nIn the sphere of the environment, Beyer noted that nature religionists held to a \"holistic conception of reality\" and \"a valorisation of physical place as vital aspects of their spiritualities\". Similarly, Beyer noted the individualism which was favoured by nature religionists. He remarked that those adhering to such beliefs typically had respect for \"charismatic and hence purely individual authority\" and place a \"strong emphasis on individual paths\" which led them to believe in \"the equal value of individuals and groups\". Along similar lines, he also commented on the \"strong experiential basis\" to nature religionist beliefs \"where personal experience is a final arbiter of truth or validity\".\n\nIn April 1996, the University of Lancaster in North West England held a conference on contemporary Paganism entitled \"Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s\", and ultimately led to the publication of an academic anthology of the same name two years later. This book, \"Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World\", was edited by members of the University's Department of Religious Studies, a postgraduate named Joanne Pearson and two professors, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel.\n\nIn his study of Wicca, the Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White expressed the view that the category of \"nature religion\" was problematic from a \"historical perspective\" because it solely emphasises the \"commonalities of belief and attitude to the natural world\" that are found between different religions and in doing so divorces these different belief systems from their distinctive socio-cultural and historical backgrounds.\n\n\n"}

They were sometimes so arranged as to furnish a supply of water, as at Pamphylian Side. A nymphaeum dedicated to a local water nymph, Coventina, was built along Hadrian's Wall, in the northernmost reach of the Roman Empire. Subsequently, artificial grottoes took the place of natural ones.\n\nThe nymphaeum in Jerash, Jordan (\"illustration, right\"), was constructed in 191 AD. The fountain was originally embellished with marble facing on the lower level, painted plaster on the upper level, and topped with a half-dome roof, forming a giant niche. Water cascaded through seven carved lion's heads into small basins on the sidewalk.\nThe nymphaea of the Roman period, which extended the sacral use to purely recreational ones, were borrowed from the constructions of the Hellenistic east. The majority of them were rotundas, and were adorned with statues and paintings. They served the threefold purpose of sanctuaries, reservoirs and assembly-rooms. A special feature was their use for the celebration of marriages. Such nymphaea existed in Corinth, Antioch and Constantinople; the remains of some twenty have been found in Rome and many in Africa. The so-called exedra of Herodes Atticus (which corresponds in all respects to a nymphaeum in the Roman style), the nymphaeum in the palace of Domitian and those in Hadrian's Villa in Tivoli (\"Tibur\") — five in number — may be specially mentioned.\n\nNymphaea were important in the architectural movement of mosaic from floor to walls and ceiling vaults in the 1st century. Initially they were often decorated with geometrical mosaics often incorporating shells, but by the end of the century could contain ambitious figure subjects.\n\nThe term nymphaeum was also applied to the fountains of water in the atrium of the Christian basilica, which according to Eusebius were symbols of purification. Phiale is an equivalent Greek term.\n\nA nymphaeum for \"al fresco\" summer dining featuring artificial grottoes with waterflows was designed by Bartolomeo Ammanati (1550‑1553), and was reintroduced at the Villa Giulia, Rome.\n\n\n"}

After the federal government closed Tarpon Bay to powerboat traffic, he became a full-time adventurer and writer.\n\nWhite has traveled extensively and participated in a wide variety of adventures, including dog sledding in Alaska, helping to re-establish Little League baseball in Cuba, and ferrying Cuban refugees to safety during the Mariel boatlift.\n\nSt. Martin's Press published his first Doc Ford novel, \"Sanibel Flats\" in 1990 with a three-book contract and option for the fourth. Dissatisfied with the money paid for and the scant promotion of his first three books, White signed with G.P.

Other achievements include sailing single-handed across the Atlantic in a small boat, and trekking alone through Chile on horseback.\n\nRosie Swale-Pope was born as Rosie Griffin in Davos, Switzerland. Her Swiss mother was suffering from tuberculosis, and her Irish father Ronnie Griffin was serving in the British Army, so she was brought up by the wife of the local postman. She was two when her mother died, and she went to live with her paternal grandmother, called Carlie, who was bedridden with osteoarthritis, in Askeaton in County Limerick, Ireland.\n\nWhen she was five, her father remarried and moved to Ireland, with his French wife Marriane. They had four children, Maude, Greald, Nicholas and Ronnie. Although they were only in the next cottage, Rosie stayed with her grandmother and looked after four orphaned donkeys, seven goats, and a pet cow called Cleopatra. Rosie learnt to ride, often going out on her black horse \"Columbine\" all day exploring the countryside.\n\nHer grandmother was very religious and worried that the local school would be a bad influence, so Rosie was schooled at home. Although her coursework mostly consisted of simply writing about what she had done each day, it proved to be useful training for her later writing about her travels and adventures.\n\nHer father died in 1957, and when she was thirteen, Rosie was sent to a strict boarding school for girls in Cork.\n\nAt 18 her first job was as a reporter for a regional newspaper, the \"Surrey Advertiser\". It didn't last long however, and she hitch-hiked to Delhi, Nepal and Russia, with almost no money or luggage.\n\nRosie was married to Colin Swale in her early twenties. They originally lived in a small flat in London, but when their daughter Eve was born, they bought a catamaran (named the \"Anneliese\" in memory of Rosie's sister she only knew from a photo) and sailed to Italy, where Rosie's son James was born on board the boat.\n\nBeginning in December 1971, Rosie sailed around the world from Gibraltar via Australia, with her first husband, Colin Swale and daughter Eve on their catamaran, the \"Anneliese\". The trip was part sponsored by the \"Daily Mail\" newspaper and also by Independent Television News (ITN) who provided them with a camera to record their own news reports of the journey. They sailed across the Atlantic, through the Panama Canal and across the Pacific, stopping at the Galapagos Islands, the Marquesas, Tahiti and Tonga, before reaching Australia in 1973. They were the first catamaran to round Cape Horn.\n\nAlthough both Swale and her husband were able to sail and had prepared as well as they could, the trip had its risks, and it nearly ended in disaster 3 times: when Rosie fell overboard in the Caribbean from the closest land; again when she needed emergency medical treatment in hospital; and a third time when the whole family suffered arsenic poisoning from a meal of unsoaked beans. The hardships were survived, however, and the voyage was a significant navigational achievement, using only an old Spitfire compass, nautical charts and a sextant, in the days before GPS. By the time the family finally returned to Plymouth, Rosie had not only completed her first book, \"Rosie Darling\" (often working below decks on her typewriter for up to six hours at a time), but had also written her second book, \"Children of Cape Horn\".\n\nIn 1983, Rosie Swale sailed solo across the Atlantic in a small cutter, which she had found in a cowshed in Wales and named \"Fiesta Girl\". Aiming to be the fourth woman to sail alone to America in a small boat from England (the first being Ann Davison in 1952–1953, followed by Nicolette Milnes-Walker in 1972 and Clare Francis in 1973), she also wanted to raise funds for a CAT Scanner for the Royal Marsden Hospital in London. Divorced from Colin Swale, Rosie also found her second husband, sailor and photographer Clive Pope, during the preparations for the trip, when he rigged the boat for her.\n\nDeparting from Pembroke in Wales on 13 July 1983, she sailed to the Azores and Caribbean Islands. Simply equipped, Rosie navigated by the stars and was nearly run down by an oil tanker. When she was north of Puerto Rico, she was becalmed for so long she was without food and water for five days and nearly drowned when she was swept overboard in storms. She arrived at Staten Island, New York, after completing her record-breaking in 70 days – navigating by the stars with the aid of her Timex watch.\n\nA year after returning from her Atlantic crossing, Rosie decided that she really wanted to see Cape Horn again and decided to plan a trek through Chile on horseback. The journey took her from the northern port of Antofagasta to Cape Horn, and she rode two Chilean Aculeos horses named 'Hornero' and 'Jolgorio'. From the Hacienda Los Lingues, the horses of the Aculeo Stables were originally brought to Chile by the Spanish Conquistadors in 1492.\n\nLeaving Antofagasta on 22 July 1984, Rosie had secured the protection of General César Mendoza, who was the head of Chile's Military Police (and later the leader of the military Junta there). An Olympic horseman, Mendoza provided her with an armed escort for the first stage. The whole trip was planned to take four months but actually took fourteen. In the first week of her journey, Rosie was caught in a desert sand storm which scattered the horses and all her equipment. Later she fell from one of the horses and broke two ribs. She also faced starvation when she became lost in the southern rain forests and ran out of food. Delayed by bad weather, Rosie arrived at Cape Horn on 2 September 1985, a total of 409 days after she had set out. Rosie wrote of her experiences in Chile in her book \"Back to Cape Horn\" in 1986.\n\nOn 25 September 1987, Rosie set off from the beach near her home in Tenby to walk around Wales in winter. She was carrying everything she needed, including a small tent to sleep in, and was supported by her husband Clive, who also walked with her when other commitments permitted. Rosie completed on foot and wrote about her experiences in her book \"Winter Wales\".\n\nIn 1995 Rosie ran her first London Marathon in a time of six hours and described it as her most memorable sporting moment.\n\nIn 1997 Rosie ran across the Sahara desert in the Sahara marathon. Described as 'the toughest footrace on earth', the 'Marathon des Sables' is run over six days and is the equivalent of five and a half normal marathons. Like all the other competitors, Rosie had to carry everything she needed on her back in a rucksack. She ran across the Sahara a second time in 2000.\n\nIn 1997 Rosie ran through Romania to the Hungarian border.\n\nIn 1999 Rosie ran solo across Iceland. The run took her from the Arctic Circle to the capital, Reykjavík.\n\nTo mark the millennium, Rosie Swale achieved a long-standing ambition and successfully completed the challenging 'Comrades Marathon', one of the world's oldest and largest ultramarathons, run over a distance of approximately between the capital of the Kwazulu-Natal Province of South Africa, Pietermaritzburg, and the coastal city of Durban. The direction of the race alternates each year between the up run starting from Durban and the down run starting from Pietermaritzburg. Equivalent to running two marathons, Rosie Swale Pope completed it in 11 hours 1 minute 1 second. She was awarded a bronze medal for completing the race, which has been described as the roadrunner's equivalent to climbing Mount Everest.\n\nIn 2000 Rosie ran through the Balkans from Macedonia. It was a dangerous run, and she was held up at gunpoint but managed to escape to reach the border. She flew into Skopje on 11 April 2001 and ran across the then-closed border into Kosovo, then across a closed border through Montenegro, where she ran for twenty-four hours, through deserted villages and deep snow until she reached northern Albania.\n\nOn 8 November 2001, Rosie set off to run across Cuba. It took 46 days and she was running the marathon distance every day (and several nights) with a rucksack on her back and camping in a lightweight bivouac. She lived on rice and sugar cane and had to avoid the Cuban Police, who were concerned for her safety. She also entered and completed the Havana Marathon, finishing in 4 hours and 52 minutes. Crossing from West to East, and running alone to raise money for the charity Age Concern, the straight-line distance was , but Rosie covered over , camping by the side of the road and in the jungle. The run took almost seven weeks. She reached the Punta de Maisi lighthouse, her finish point, on Christmas Day 2001.\n\nRosie ran the Marathon in Cardiff in 2002, in aid of her local Hospital in West Wales where her husband Clive had died of prostate cancer ten weeks before. She finished in a time of 4.15.35 (h.m.s), despite a nasty fall six miles (9.7 km) from the finishing line, and received the award for the fastest 55-year-old competitor.\n\nIn April 2003 Rosie ran across Nepal to raise money for the Nepal Trust, a small charity which carries out development work in the remote rural areas of North-West Nepal in a region referred to as the 'Hidden Himalayas'. The journey from one end of Nepal to the other was and established a new world-record time of 68 days. Rosie also raised over US$8000 which was used to help sponsor a health camp at the district headquarters of Simikot, Humla.\n\nWhen her second husband, Clive, 73, died of prostate cancer in 2002, Rosie decided to run around the world to raise money for the Prostate Cancer Charity and an orphanage in Kitezh, Russia which provides children with education and care.\n\nHer aim was to run around the northern hemisphere taking in as much land mass as possible, with no support crew and just minimal supplies and sponsorship. Rosie started from her home town of Tenby in Wales on her 57th birthday, 2 October 2003, where her first footfall is engraved in a flagstone on her front step. Equipped with just a small specially designed cart of food and basic camping equipment, the trip was funded by renting out her cottage. By 5 April 2004, she reached Moscow, Russia, and on 15 September 2005, she reached Magadan in far eastern Russia. After facing extreme conditions in the Alaskan Winter, she reached the road again on 17 April 2006, and in October 2006, she was in Edmonton, Canada. Four years after the departure, on 2 October 2007, she reached New York City, US.\n\nShe ran harnessed to her cart, which was designed for sleeping, shelter and storage. Her son James maintained a website that was followed closely by her supporters and provided regular updates and messages about her progress. Her supporter Geoff Hall organised supplies and equipment to reach her around the world. In the Faroes, she took part in an organised midnight hike to take in the scenery. She also gave cultural talks while on the road, and described how she met a naked man with a gun, how Siberian wolves ran with her for a week, and taking a break to run the Chicago marathon along the way.\n\nSurviving on minimal rations, Rosie fell ill near Lake Baikal in Russia, possibly from a tick bite, and wandered into the path of a bus. She was knocked unconscious and taken in the bus to hospital. In Alaska, she had to cope with temperatures of and nearly froze in her sleeping bag at night. She was stuck in a blizzard by the Yukon River and got severe frostbite of her foot. She had no alternative but to call friends in Wales for help, who then called the Alaskan National Guard, who helped her get the frostbite treated, so she could continue on her run.\n\nShe left Canada by air from St John's (Newfoundland) on 24 January 2008, to make a short visit to Greenland before flying to Iceland on 9 February 2008, and continued running to eastern Iceland. While running, she slipped on the ice, breaking several ribs and cracking her hip. She was over a hundred miles (160 km) from the nearest house from where she fell and had to walk two miles (3.2 km), with her injuries, before she was found and got medical attention.\n\nOn 18 June 2008, she arrived at Scrabster, in Scotland's far north, by ferry from Iceland, and ran from Scrabster back home to Tenby. Rosie successfully completed the journey, and despite stress fractures in both legs, which turned the final few miles back to Tenby into a hobble on crutches, she returned to her home on 25 August 2008, at 14:18 local time. A large crowd of Tenby residents and Bank Holiday visitors turned out to witness her return and welcome her home. Her distance travelled was .\n\nSwale wrote a book about her experiences entitled \"Just a Little Run Around the World: 5 Years, 3 Packs of Wolves and 53 Pairs of Shoes\", which was released on 28 May 2009.\n\nThe British progressive rock band Big Big Train's song The Passing Widow (from the 2017 album The Second Brightest Star) was written about Swale's round-the-world run.\n\nWhile running around the world, she took a break from it during a week after having reached Edmonton, Canada. She took part in the 2006 Chicago Marathon, to which she was invited in order to support charity work. The marathon race took 4:40. After the race, she flew back to Edmonton and continued running around the world.\n\nIn September 2009, Rosie Swale Pope ran along the east coast of Ireland, from Rosslare to the Giant's Causeway, pulling her cart which she named 'Icebird' to highlight the importance of cancer awareness. She completed the run on her birthday, 2 October 2009 and the anniversary of setting out on her round-the-world run in 2003, and said that the Wicklow Mountains were one of her toughest challenges.\n\nIn 2015 Rosie began running 3,371 miles across America, from New York to San Francisco.\n\nSwale-Pope was awarded an MBE for her charity work in the 2008/9 new year honours list. Queen Elizabeth II presented her with the MBE. Paul Harris Fellowship Rotary International. Margarette Golding Award. Fellow of the RSGS. Citation from Governor of New Jersey on completion of solo transatlantic voyage.\nSwale-Pope is a patron of PHASE (Practical Help Achieving Self Empowerment) Worldwide, an organisation that works with disadvantaged communities in extremely isolated Himalayan villages in Nepal.\n\nIn 1990, Swale presented Channel 4's documentary film \"Revenge of the Rain Gods\", directed by Simon Normanton, about her journey around the Maya World. In the documentary, Swale explores Mayan ruins and meets surviving Mayan communities, which cameraman Desmond Seal described as 'a very wet trip around the edge of the Caribbean, Guatemala, Belize and Mexico'.\n\nSwale-Pope is a patron of PHASE Worldwide, which works to improve education, healthcare and livelihoods in remote areas of Nepal.\n\n\n"}

Scolecodonts are common and diverse microfossils, which range from the Cambrian period (around half a billion years ago at the start of the Paleozoic era) to the present. They diversified profusely in the Ordovician, and are most common in the Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian marine deposits of the Paleozoic era.\n\nRelatedly, more problematic worm-like fossils have been described in even older, Neoproterozoic era deposits in the Ediacaran Hills of southern Australia and in mid-Cambrian deposits of Burgess shale in British Columbia.\n\nSince the other classes of annelids (specifically, the earthworms and leeches) lack hard parts, only the sea-dwelling polychaetes are frequently represented in the fossil record. Polychaetes are commonly fossilized due to their chitinous teeth and their dwelling tubes made of durable calcite (a calcium carbonate), hardened mucus (a.k.a. parchment), and/or chitin-like cement.\n\nScolecodonts belonging to the extinct families Atraktoprionidae, Hadoprionidae, Kalloprionidae, Mochtyellidae, Paulinitidae, Polychaetaspidae, Ramphoprionidae, Rhytiprionidae, Skalenoprionidae, Symmetroprionidae, Xanioprionidae, and the still-extant (living) family Oenonidae (which includes the Arabellidae) are known from Silurian rocks in Scotland. Scolecodonts representing the present-day families Onuphidae and Dorvilleidae first appeared in Mesozoic era deposits.\n\nSegments of the fossil jaw of a polychaete worm were first reported from Silurian strata on the Estonian island of Saaremaa in 1854, but they were misinterpreted as fish teeth. A year later, impressions of whole polychaete worms with poorly preserved jaws were described from Italian Tertiary deposits. Subsequently E. Ehlers, a specialist on recent polychaetes, recorded them from the Jurassic Solenhofen Stone of Bavaria, Germany, demonstrating their affinity and proposing the generic names \"Eunicites\" and \"Lumbriconereites\". Extensive studies in the late 19th century by George J. Hinde of material from England, Wales, Canada and Sweden established a basis for the nomenclature of what he regarded as isolated components of annelid jaws; but study of them lapsed thereafter for almost 50 years.\n\n"}

You have nothing to lose but your chains!\"). A variation of this phrase (\"Workers of all lands, unite\") is also inscribed on Marx's tombstone. The essence of the slogan is that members of the working classes throughout the world should cooperate to achieve victory in class conflict.\n\nFive years before \"The Communist Manifesto\", this phrase appeared in the 1843 book \"The Workers' Union\" by Flora Tristan.\n\nThe International Workingmen's Association, described by Engels as \"the first international movement of the working class\" was persuaded by Engels to change its motto from the League of the Just's \"all men are brothers\" to \"working men of all countries, unite!\". It reflected Marx's and Engels' view of proletarian internationalism.\n\nThe phrase has overlapping meanings: first, that workers should unite in unions to better push for their demands such as workplace pay and conditions; secondly, that workers should see beyond their various craft unions and unite against the capitalist system; and thirdly, that workers of different countries have more in common with each other than workers and employers of the same country.\n\nThe phrase was used by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in their publications and songs and was a mainstay on banners in May Day demonstrations. The IWW used it when opposing World War I in both the United States and Australia.\n\nThe slogan was the Soviet Union's state motto (Пролетарии всех стран, соединяйтесь!; \"Proletarii vsekh stran, soyedinyaytes'!\") and it appeared in the State Emblem of the Soviet Union, on 1919 Russian SFSR banknotes (in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Italian and Russian), on Soviet coins from 1921 to 1934 and in most Soviet newspapers. The nascent Soviet Union under Vladimir Lenin was oriented toward international communism.\n\nContemporarily, some socialist and communist parties continue using it. Moreover, it is a common usage in popular culture, often chanted during labor strikes and protests.\n\nIn the first Swedish translation of \"The Communist Manifesto\", published in 1848, the translator Pehr Götrek substituted the slogan \"Folkets röst, Guds röst!\" (i.e. \"Vox populi, vox Dei\", or \"The Voice of the People, the Voice of God\"). However, later translations have included the original slogan.\n\nAmongst Maoist-oriented groups a variation invented by Vladimir Lenin, \"Workers and Oppressed Peoples and Nations of the World, Unite!\", is sometimes used. This slogan was the rallying cry of the 2nd Comintern congress in 1920 and denoted the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist agenda of the Comintern.\n\nThe phrase has been translated into many languages. All of the Soviet Socialist Republics in the Soviet Union had it as their motto translated into the local languages. \n\n"}
{"id": "38714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38714", "title": "World", "text": "World\n\nThe world is the planet Earth and all life upon it, including human civilization. In a philosophical context, the \"world\" is the whole of the physical Universe, or an ontological world (the \"world\" of an individual). In a theological context, the \"world\" is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred spheres. \"End of the world\" scenarios refer to the end of human history, often in religious contexts.\n\nThe history of the world is commonly understood as spanning the major geopolitical developments of about five millennia, from the first civilizations to the present. In terms such as world religion, world language, world government, and world war, the term \"world\" suggests an international or intercontinental scope without necessarily implying participation of every part of the world.\n\nThe world population is the sum of all human populations at any time; similarly, the world economy is the sum of the economies of all societies or countries, especially in the context of globalization. Terms such as \"world championship\", \"gross world product\", and \"world flags\" imply the sum or combination of all sovereign states.\n\nThe English word \"world\" comes from the Old English \"weorold (-uld), weorld, worold (-uld, -eld)\", a compound of \"wer\" \"man\" and \"eld\" \"age,\" which thus means roughly \"Age of Man.\"\nThe Old English is a reflex of the Common Germanic \"*wira-alđiz\", also reflected in Old Saxon \"werold\", Old Dutch \"werilt\", Old High German \"weralt\", Old Frisian \"warld\" and Old Norse \"verǫld\" (whence the Icelandic \"veröld\").\n\nThe corresponding word in Latin is \"mundus\", literally \"clean, elegant\", itself a loan translation of Greek \"cosmos\" \"orderly arrangement.\" While the Germanic word thus reflects a mythological notion of a \"domain of Man\" (compare Midgard), presumably as opposed to the divine sphere on the one hand and the chthonic sphere of the underworld on the other, the Greco-Latin term expresses a notion of creation as an act of establishing order out of chaos.\n\n\"World\" distinguishes the entire planet or population from any particular country or region: \"world affairs\" pertain not just to one place but to the whole world, and \"world history\" is a field of history that examines events from a global (rather than a national or a regional) perspective. \"Earth\", on the other hand, refers to the planet as a physical entity, and distinguishes it from other planets and physical objects.\n\n\"World\" was also classically used to mean the material universe, or the cosmos: \"The worlde is an apte frame of heauen and earthe, and all other naturall thinges contained in them.\" The earth was often described as \"the center of the world\".\n\nThe term can also be used attributively, to mean \"global\", or \"relating to the whole world\", forming usages such as world community or world canonical texts.\n\nBy extension, a \"world\" may refer to any planet or heavenly body, especially when it is thought of as inhabited, especially in the context of science fiction or futurology.\n\n\"World\", in its original sense, when qualified, can also refer to a particular domain of human experience.\n\n\nIn philosophy, the term world has several possible meanings. In some contexts, it refers to everything that makes up reality or the physical universe. In others, it can mean have a specific ontological sense (see world disclosure). While clarifying the concept of world has arguably always been among the basic tasks of Western philosophy, this theme appears to have been raised explicitly only at the start of the twentieth century and has been the subject of continuous debate. The question of what the world is has by no means been settled.\n\nThe traditional interpretation of Parmenides' work is that he argued that the everyday perception of reality of the physical world (as described in \"doxa\") is mistaken, and that the reality of the world is 'One Being' (as described in aletheia): an unchanging, ungenerated, indestructible whole.\n\nIn his Allegory of the Cave, Plato distinguishes between forms and ideas and imagines two distinct worlds: the sensible world and the intelligible world.\n\nIn Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's philosophy of history, the expression \"Weltgeschichte ist Weltgericht\" (World History is a tribunal that judges the World) is used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions. Science is born from the desire to transform the World in relation to Man; its final end is technical application.\n\n\"The World as Will and Representation\" is the central work of Arthur Schopenhauer.\nSchopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation; the Kantian thing-in-itself. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body.\n\nTwo definitions that were both put forward in the 1920s, however, suggest the range of available opinion. \"The world is everything that is the case,\" wrote Ludwig Wittgenstein in his influential \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\", first published in 1921. This definition would serve as the basis of logical positivism, with its assumption that there is exactly one world, consisting of the totality of facts, regardless of the interpretations that individual people may make of them.\n\nMartin Heidegger, meanwhile, argued that \"the surrounding world is different for each of us, and notwithstanding that we move about in a common world\". The world, for Heidegger, was that into which we are always already \"thrown\" and with which we, as beings-in-the-world, must come to terms. His conception of \"world disclosure\" was most notably elaborated in his 1927 work \"Being and Time\".\n\nIn response, Sigmund Freud proposed that we do not move about in a common world, but a common thought process. He believed that all the actions of a person are motivated by one thing: lust. This led to numerous theories about reactionary consciousness.\n\nSome philosophers, often inspired by David Lewis, argue that metaphysical concepts such as possibility, probability, and necessity are best analyzed by comparing \"the\" world to a range of possible worlds; a view commonly known as modal realism.\n\nMythological cosmologies often depict the world as centered on an \"axis mundi\" and delimited by a boundary such as a world ocean, a world serpent or similar. In some religions, worldliness (also called carnality) is that which relates to this world as opposed to other worlds or realms.\n\nIn Buddhism, the world means society, as distinct from the monastery. It refers to the material world, and to worldly gain such as wealth, reputation, jobs, and war. The spiritual world would be the path to enlightenment, and changes would be sought in what we could call the psychological realm.\n\nIn Christianity, the term often connotes the concept of the fallen and corrupt world order of human society, in contrast to the World to Come. The world is frequently cited alongside \"the flesh\" and \"the Devil\" as a source of temptation that Christians should flee. Monks speak of striving to be \"\"in\" this world, but not \"of\" this world\"—as Jesus said—and the term \"worldhood\" has been distinguished from \"monkhood\", the former being the status of merchants, princes, and others who deal with \"worldly\" things.\n\nThis view is clearly expressed by king Alfred the Great of England (d. 899) in his famous Preface to the \"Cura Pastoralis\":\nAlthough Hebrew and Greek words meaning \"world\" are used in Scripture with the normal variety of senses, many examples of its use in this particular sense can be found in the teachings of Jesus according to the Gospel of John, e.g. 7:7, 8:23, 12:25, 14:17, 15:18-19, 17:6-25, 18:36. For contrast, a relatively newer concept is Catholic imagination.\n\n\"Contemptus mundi\" is the name given to the recognition that the world, in all its vanity, is nothing more than a futile attempt to hide from God by stifling our desire for the good and the holy. This view has been criticized as a \"pastoral of fear\" by modern historian Jean Delumeau.\n\nDuring the Second Vatican Council, there was a novel attempt to develop a positive theological view of the World, which is illustrated by the pastoral optimism of the constitutions \"Gaudium et spes\", \"Lumen gentium\", \"Unitatis redintegratio\" and \"Dignitatis humanae\".\n\nIn Eastern Christian monasticism or asceticism, the world of mankind is driven by passions. Therefore, the passions of the World are simply called \"the world\". Each of these passions are a link to the world of mankind or order of human society. Each of these passions must be overcome in order for a person to receive salvation (theosis). The process of theosis is a personal relationship with God. This understanding is taught within the works of ascetics like Evagrius Ponticus, and the most seminal ascetic works read most widely by Eastern Christians, the Philokalia and the Ladder of Divine Ascent (the works of Evagrius and John Climacus are also contained within the Philokalia). At the highest level of world transcendence is hesychasm which culminates into the Vision of God.\n\n\"Orbis Catholicus\" is a Latin phrase meaning \"Catholic world\", per the expression Urbi et Orbi, and refers to that area of Christendom under papal supremacy. It is somewhat similar to the phrases secular world, Jewish world and Islamic world.\n\n\"Dunya\" derives from the root word \"dana\" that means to bring near. In that sense, \"dunya\" is \"what is brought near\".\n\nHinduism is an Indian religion and \"dharma\", or a way of life, widely practised in the Indian subcontinent. It includes a number of Indian religious traditions with a loose sense of interconnection, as different from Jainism and Buddhism, and (since medieaval and modern times) Islam and Christianity. Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world,\n"}
