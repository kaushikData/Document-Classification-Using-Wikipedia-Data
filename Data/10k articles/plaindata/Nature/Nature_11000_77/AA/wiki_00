It measures approximately 400 meters in diameter. It is also one of the best studied PHAs and was the 10th Aten asteroid to be numbered.\n\n orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.42–1.02 AU once every 7 months (222 days; semi-major axis of 0.72 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.42 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nAt the time of its discovery, astronomers were trying to find the first Apohele asteroid (one that is always closer to the Sun than Earth). All asteroids known at the time that got closer to the Sun than Earth also crossed Earth's orbit. Earlier that year, David J. Tholen claimed to have spotted the first Apohele asteroid, which was dubbed . However, the object was lost without being confirmed. Thus, 1993 DA remained the asteroid with the lowest known aphelion at 1.023 AU. When was discovered, it was found to have a slightly smaller aphelion (1.019 AU) than 1993 DA, and was thus the closest thing to an Apohele asteroid known at the time. It lost its smallest aphelion title almost immediately when was discovered only a few weeks later (aphelion = 1.014 AU). Asteroids with even smaller aphelions were discovered until February 2003, when finally, an asteroid with an aphelion smaller than 1.000 AU was discovered. This was 163693 Atira, the first confirmed Apohele asteroid.\n\n was the second asteroid discovered to be close enough to Venus as to be within the major planet's zone of influence. It is located at about the inner edge of the zone, while (99907) 1989 VA, the first asteroid discovered there, is at about the outer edge. It is possible for planets to capture asteroids located in their sphere of influences into co-orbital relationships such as Trojan and horseshoe asteroids. Because of its frequent close encounters with Mercury and Earth, however, it may prove difficult for Venus to keep in a co-orbital relationship for any length of time. Of the six objects in Venus's zone of influence, only one () is currently a co-orbital.\n\n is a potentially hazardous asteroid. That means its orbit takes it very close to Earth and if it were to collide with our planet, it would cause devastation on at least a regional scale. On December 16, 2001, it became the first PHA to be observed passing within 5 Lunar Distances (the average distance between Earth and the Moon) from Earth. Other asteroids have come closer, and numerous have even come closer than the Moon, but these have all been small asteroids, incapable of causing much damage to the planet, or much concern. The 2001 encounter was the closest known approach to Earth any PHA had made since passed by on August 27, 1969. However, was not discovered until September 1999 many years after its closest approach, so no one knew about in 1969.\nIn September 2004, the well known PHA 4179 Toutatis came about 4 Lunar Distances from Earth. Due to its diameter being over ten times larger (5.7 km) and its closer approach, Toutatis at its closest (mag 8.9) was about half an apparent magnitude brighter than was at its closest (mag 9.5). However, Toutatis arrived during a full moon, and thus 's 2001 encounter is still the most easily observed flyby of an asteroid in history. It also made the first Near-Earth asteroid observed to be brighter than magnitude 10.\n\n is a Mercury-crosser asteroid, a Venus-crosser asteroid, and an Earth-crosser asteroid. Because of its relatively low inclination (7.34°), it is able to come close to each of these planets. Its orbit takes it within 0.021 AU of Mercury's orbit, 0.0368 AU of Venus's orbit, and 0.00989 AU of Earth's orbit. It makes frequent encounters with these inner planets. The last time it came close to Mercury, Venus and Earth was 2010, 1977, and November 12, 2004 respectively. The most recent close approach to Earth was on 11 December 2015 at about 4.2 million kilometers (2.6 million miles, 11 lunar distances). The next visit of the asteroid to Earth's neighborhood will be on 11 November 2018, when it will make a relatively distant pass at about 20 million kilometers (12.5 million miles, 52 lunar distances). These encounters perturb its orbit parameters slightly, and each pass reduces its inclination further.\n\nDuring its close encounters in 2001 and 2015, astronomers were able to make radar images of its surface and determine physical properties that remain unknown for most asteroids. According to the ExploreNEOs Warm Spitzer Exploration Science program, is a bright E-type asteroid with an exceptionally high albedo of .\n\n measures between 350 and 415 meters in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.34 and 0.75.

This means that during favourable years it is easy to reach from Earth. Several times this decade, it will be an easier target than Earth's own Moon. It is high on the list of possible Near-Earth Asteroid targets for future flybys, landings, mining, or orbit manipulations.\n\nThis minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 28 January 2002.

It is a near-Earth object of the Apollo group and the lowest numbered potentially hazardous asteroid. In 1968, it became the first asteroid ever observed by radar. Its orbit brings it closer to the Sun than Mercury and further out than the orbit of Mars, which also makes it a Mercury-, Venus-, and Mars-crosser. This stony asteroid and relatively fast rotator was discovered by German astronomer Walter Baade at the Palomar Observatory, California, on 27 June 1949. It was named after the mythological boy Icarus, who flew too close to the Sun.\n\n\"Icarus\" orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.2–2.0 AU once every 1 years and 1 month (409 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.83 and an inclination of 23° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Palomar.\n\nAt perihelion, \"Icarus\" comes closer to the Sun than Mercury, i.e. it is a Mercury-crossing asteroid. It is also a Venus and Mars-crosser. From 1949 until the discovery of 3200 Phaethon in 1983, it was known as the asteroid that passed closest to the Sun. Since then hundreds of Mercury-crossers have been found, the closest ones are now being and \"(also see )\".\n\n\"Icarus\" is thought to be the source of the Arietids, a strong daylight meteor shower. However other objects such as the short-period sun-grazing comet 96P/Machholz are also possible candidates for the shower's origin.\n\n\"Icarus\" has an \"Earth minimum orbital intersection distance\" of , which translates into 13.7 lunar distances (LD). This near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid makes close approaches to Earth in June at intervals of 9, 19, or 28 years.\n\nIn 14 June 1968, it came as close as , or 16 LD. During this approach, Icarus became the first minor planet to be observed using radar, with measurements obtained at the Haystack Observatory and the Goldstone Tracking Station.\n\nThe last close approach was on 16 June 2015, when \"Icarus\" passed Earth at or 22 LD. Before that, the previous close approach was on 11 June 1996, at , almost 40 times as far as the Moon. The next notably close approach will be on 13 June 2043, at from Earth.\n\nRadiometric observation characterized \"Icarus\" as a stony S-type and Q-type asteroid.\n\nSince 1968, several rotational lightcurves of \"Icarus\" were obtained from photometric and radiometric observations. During the asteroid's close approach in June 2017, observations of the fast-moving object were taken by Italian astronomers Virginio Oldani and Federico Manzini, Brian Warner at the Palmer Divide Station () in California, and by Australian astronomers at the Darling Range and Blue Mountains Observatories ().\n\nLightcurve analysis gave it a consolidated rotation period of 2.2726 hours with a brightness variation of 0.22 magnitude (). \"Icarus\" is a relatively fast rotator, near the threshold where non-solid rubble piles fly apart.\n\nIn 2015, radiometric observations at the Goldstone Observatory in California found a spin axis of (270.0°, −81.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β).\n\nAccording to several radiometric and photometric observations, including the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, \"Icarus\" measures between 1.0 and 1.44 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.14 and 0.51.\n\nThe \"Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link\" adopts the radiometric results obtained at Goldstone Observatory in June 2015, which gave an albedo of 0.14 and a diameter of 1.44 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 16.96. Goldstone observations also gave the body's dimensions: 1.61 × 1.60 × 1.17 kilometers.\n\nThis minor planet was named after Icarus, son of Daedalus \"(also see 1864 Daedalus)\" from Greek mythology. They attempted to escape prison by means of wings constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the Sun. When the wax in his wings melted he fell into the sea and drowned. The naming was suggested by R. C. Cameron and Dr. Folkman. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center before November 1977 (). Both mythological figures are honored with the lunar craters \"Icarus\" and \"Daedalus\".\n\n\"Icarus\" is being studied to better understand general relativity, solar oblateness, and Yarkovsky drift. Perihelion precession, caused by general relativity, in the case of Icarus is 10.05 arcseconds per Julian century.\n\n\"Project Icarus\" was a student project conducted at MIT in the spring of 1967, to defend against risks from .\n\nThis project was an assignment by Paul Sandorff for his group of Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate students in a systems engineering class to devise a plan to use rockets to deflect or destroy \"Icarus\" in the case that it was found to be on a collision course with planet Earth. \"Time\" magazine ran an article on the endeavor in June 1967 and the following year the student report was published as a book.\n\nIn the course of their study the students visited the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, where they were so impressed with the Vertical Assembly Building that they wrote of \"the awesome reality\" that had \"completely erased\" their doubts over using the technology associated with the Apollo program and Saturn rockets.\n\nThe report later served as the basis and inspiration for the 1979 science fiction film \"Meteor\".\n\n"}

{"id": "78452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78452", "title": "Ceres (mythology)", "text": "Ceres (mythology)\n\nIn ancient Roman religion, Ceres (; ) was a goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships. She was originally the central deity in Rome's so-called plebeian or Aventine Triad, then was paired with her daughter Proserpina in what Romans described as \"the Greek rites of Ceres\". Her seven-day April festival of Cerealia included the popular \"Ludi Ceriales\" (Ceres' games). She was also honoured in the May \"lustratio\" of the fields at the Ambarvalia festival, at harvest-time, and during Roman marriages and funeral rites.\n\nCeres is the only one of Rome's many agricultural deities to be listed among the Dii Consentes, Rome's equivalent to the Twelve Olympians of Greek mythology. The Romans saw her as the counterpart of the Greek goddess Demeter, whose mythology was reinterpreted for Ceres in Roman art and literature.\n\nCeres' name derives from the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European root \"*ḱerh₃-\", meaning \"to satiate, to feed\", which is also the root for Latin \"crescere\" \"to grow\" and through it, the English words \"create\" and \"increase\". Roman etymologists thought \"ceres\" derived from the Latin verb \"gerere\", \"to bear, bring forth, produce\", because the goddess was linked to pastoral, agricultural and human fertility. Archaic cults to Ceres are well-evidenced among Rome's neighbours in the Regal period, including the ancient Latins, Oscans and Sabellians, less certainly among the Etruscans and Umbrians. An archaic Faliscan inscription of c. 600 BC asks her to provide \"far\" (spelt wheat), which was a dietary staple of the Mediterranean world. Throughout the Roman era, Ceres' name was synonymous with grain and, by extension, with bread.\n\nCeres was credited with the discovery of spelt wheat (Latin \"far\"), the yoking of oxen and ploughing, the sowing, protection and nourishing of the young seed, and the gift of agriculture to humankind; before this, it was said, man had subsisted on acorns, and wandered without settlement or laws. She had the power to fertilise, multiply and fructify plant and animal seed, and her laws and rites protected all activities of the agricultural cycle. In January, Ceres was offered spelt wheat and a pregnant sow, along with the earth-goddess Tellus, at the movable \"Feriae Sementivae\". This was almost certainly held before the annual sowing of grain. The divine portion of sacrifice was the entrails \"(exta)\" presented in an earthenware pot \"(olla).\" In a rural context, Cato the Elder describes the offer to Ceres of a \"porca praecidanea\" (a pig, offered before the sowing). Before the harvest, she was offered a propitiary grain sample (\"praemetium\"). Ovid tells that Ceres \"is content with little, provided that her offerings are casta\" (pure).\n\nCeres' main festival, Cerealia, was held from mid to late April. It was organised by her plebeian aediles and included circus games (\"ludi circenses\"). It opened with a horse-race in the Circus Maximus, whose starting point lay below and opposite to her Aventine Temple; the turning post at the far end of the Circus was sacred to Consus, a god of grain-storage. After the race, foxes were released into the Circus, their tails ablaze with lighted torches, perhaps to cleanse the growing crops and protect them from disease and vermin, or to add warmth and vitality to their growth. From c.175 BC, Cerealia included \"ludi scaenici\" (theatrical religious events) through April 12 to 18.\n\nIn the ancient \"sacrum cereale\" a priest, probably the Flamen Cerialis, invoked Ceres (and probably Tellus) along with twelve specialised, minor assistant-gods to secure divine help and protection at each stage of the grain cycle, beginning shortly before the Feriae Sementivae. W.H. Roscher lists these deities among the \"indigitamenta\", names used to invoke specific divine functions.\n\n\nIn Roman bridal processions, a young boy carried Ceres' torch to light the way; \"the most auspicious wood for wedding torches came from the \"spina alba\", the may tree, which bore many fruits and hence symbolised fertility\". The adult males of the wedding party waited at the groom's house. A wedding sacrifice was offered to Tellus on the bride's behalf; a sow is the most likely victim. Varro describes the sacrifice of a pig as \"a worthy mark of weddings\" because \"our women, and especially nurses\" call the female genitalia \"porcus\" (pig). Spaeth (1996) believes Ceres may have been included in the sacrificial dedication, because she is closely identified with Tellus and, as \"Ceres legifera\" (law-bearer), she \"bears the laws\" of marriage. In the most solemn form of marriage, \"confarreatio\", the bride and groom shared a cake made of far, the ancient wheat-type particularly associated with Ceres.\n\nFrom at least the mid-republican era, an official, joint cult to Ceres and Proserpina reinforced Ceres' connection with Roman ideals of female virtue. The promotion of this cult coincides with the rise of a plebeian nobility, an increased birthrate among plebeian commoners, and a fall in the birthrate among patrician families. The late Republican \"Ceres Mater\" (Mother Ceres) is described as \"genetrix\" (progenitress) and \"alma\" (nourishing); in the early Imperial era she becomes an Imperial deity, and receives joint cult with Ops Augusta, Ceres' own mother in Imperial guise and a bountiful genetrix in her own right. Several of Ceres' ancient Italic precursors are connected to human fertility and motherhood; the Pelignan goddess \"Angitia Cerealis\" has been identified with the Roman goddess Angerona (associated with childbirth).\n\nCeres was patron and protector of plebeian laws, rights and Tribunes. Her Aventine Temple served the plebeians as cult centre, legal archive, treasury and possibly law-court; its foundation was contemporaneous with the passage of the Lex Sacrata, which established the office and person of plebeian aediles and tribunes as inviolate representatives of the Roman people. Tribunes were legally immune to arrest or threat, and the lives and property of those who violated this law were forfeit to Ceres. The Lex Hortensia of 287 BC extended plebeian laws to the city and all its citizens. The official decrees of the Senate (\"senatus consulta\") were placed in Ceres' Temple, under the guardianship of the goddess and her aediles. Livy puts the reason bluntly: the consuls could no longer seek advantage by arbitrarily tampering with the laws of Rome. The Temple might also have offered asylum for those threatened with arbitrary arrest by patrician magistrates. Ceres' temple, games and cult were at least part-funded by fines imposed on those who offended the laws placed under her protection; the poet Vergil later calls her \"legifera Ceres\" (Law-bearing Ceres), a translation of Demeter's Greek epithet, \"thesmophoros\".\n\nAs Ceres' first plough-furrow opened the earth (Tellus' realm) to the world of men and created the first field and its boundary, her laws determined the course of settled, lawful, civilised life. Crimes against fields and harvest were crimes against the people and their protective deity. Landowners who allowed their flocks to graze on public land were fined by the plebeian aediles, on behalf of Ceres and the people of Rome. Ancient laws of the Twelve Tables forbade the magical charming of field crops from a neighbour's field into one's own, and invoked the death penalty for the illicit removal of field boundaries. An adult who damaged or stole field-crops should be hanged \"for Ceres\". Any youth guilty of the same offense was to be whipped or fined double the value of damage.\n\nThe killing of the tribune Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC was justified by some as rightful punishment for attempted tyranny, an offense against Ceres' \"Lex sacrata\". Others deplored it as murder, because the same \"Lex sacrata\" made his person sacrosanct. In 70 BC, Cicero refers to this killing in connection with Ceres' laws and cults, during his prosecution of Verres, Roman governor of Sicily, for extortion. The case included circumstantial details of Verres' irreligious exploitation and abuse of Sicilian grain farmers, who were naturally under Ceres' special protection at the very place of her \"earthly home\" – and his thefts from her temple, including an ancient image of the goddess herself. Faced by the mounting evidence against him, Verres abandoned his own defense and withdrew to a prosperous exile. Soon after, Cicero won election as aedile.\n\nCeres protected transitions of women from girlhood to womanhood, from unmarried to married life and motherhood. She also maintained the boundaries between the realms of the living and the dead, regardless of their sex. Given the appropriate rites, she helped the deceased into afterlife as an underworld shade (Di Manes), else their spirit might remain to haunt the living, as a wandering, vengeful ghost (Lemur). For this service, well-off families offered Ceres sacrifice of a pig. The poor could offer wheat, flowers, and a libation. The expected afterlife for the exclusively female initiates in the \"sacra Cereris\" may have been somewhat different; they were offered \"a method of living\" and of \"dying with better hope\".\n\nThe \"mundus cerialis\" (literally \"the world\" of Ceres or \"Caereris mundus\") was a hemispherical pit or underground vault in Rome. Its location is uncertain. It was usually sealed by a stone lid known as the \"lapis manalis\". On August 24, October 5 and November 8, it was opened with the official announcement \"mundus patet\" (\"the \"mundus\" is open\"), and offerings were made there to agricultural or underworld deities, including Ceres as goddess of the fruitful earth and guardian of its underworld portals. Its opening offered the spirits of the dead temporary leave from the underworld, to roam lawfully among the living, in what Warde Fowler describes as ‘holidays, so to speak, for the ghosts’. The days when the mundus was open were among the very few occasions that Romans made official contact with the collective spirits of the dead, the \"Di Manes\" (the others being Parentalia and Lemuralia). This secondary or late function of the \"mundus\" is attested no earlier than the Late Republican Era, by Varro. The jurist Cato understood the mundus' shape as a reflection or inversion of the dome of the upper heavens.\n\nRoman tradition held that the \"mundus\" had been dug and sealed by Romulus as part of Rome's foundation; Plutarch compares it to pits dug by Etruscan colonists, containing soil brought from their parent city, used to dedicate the first fruits of the harvest. Warde Fowler speculates the \"mundus\" as Rome's first storehouse (\"penus\") for seed-grain, later becoming the symbolic \"penus\" of the Roman state. In the oldest known Roman calendar, the days of the \"mundus\" are marked as C(omitiales) (days when the Comitia met). Later authors mark them as \"dies religiosus\" (when no official meetings could be held). Some modern scholars seek to explain this as the later introduction and accommodation of Greek elements, grafted onto the original \"mundus\" rites. The rites of August 24 were held between the agricultural festivals of Consualia and Opiconsivia; those of October 5 followed the \"Ieiunium Cereris\", and those of November 8 took place during the Plebeian Games As a whole, the various days of the \"mundus\" suggest rites to Ceres as the guardian deity of seed-corn in the establishment of cities, and in her function as a door-warden of the afterlife, which was co-ruled during the winter months by her daughter Proserpina, queen-companion to Dis.\n\nIn Roman theology, prodigies were abnormal phenomena that manifested divine anger at human impiety. In Roman histories, prodigies cluster around perceived or actual threats to the Roman state, in particular, famine, war and social disorder, and are expiated as matters of urgency. The establishment of Ceres' Aventine cult has itself been interpreted as an extraordinary expiation after the failure of crops and consequent famine. In Livy's history, Ceres is among the deities placated after a remarkable series of prodigies that accompanied the disasters of the Second Punic War: during the same conflict, a lightning strike at her temple was expiated. A fast in her honour is recorded for 191 BC, to be repeated at 5-year intervals. After 206, she was offered at least 11 further official expiations. Many of these were connected to famine and manifestations of plebeian unrest, rather than war. From the Middle Republic onwards, expiation was increasingly addressed to her as mother to Proserpina. The last known followed Rome's Great Fire of 64 AD. The cause or causes of the fire remained uncertain, but its disastrous extent was taken as a sign of offense against Juno, Vulcan, and Ceres-with-Proserpina, who were all were given expiatory cult. Champlin (2003) perceives the expiations to Vulcan and Ceres in particular as attempted populist appeals by the ruling emperor, Nero.\n\nThe complex and multi-layered origins of the Aventine Triad and Ceres herself allowed multiple interpretations of their relationships; Cicero asserts Ceres as mother to both Liber and Libera, consistent with her role as a mothering deity. Varro's more complex theology groups her functionally with Tellus, Terra, Venus (and thus Victoria) and with Libera as a female aspect of Liber. No native Roman myths of Ceres are known. According to \"interpretatio romana\", by which Roman deities were identified with their Greek counterparts, she was an equivalent to Demeter, one of the Twelve Olympians of Greek religion and mythology; this made Ceres one of Rome's twelve Di Consentes, daughter of Saturn and Ops, sister of Jupiter, mother of Proserpina by Jupiter and sister of Juno, Vesta, Neptune and Dis. Ceres' known mythology is indistinguishable from Demeter's:\n\"When Ceres sought through all the earth with lit torches for Proserpina, who had been seized by Dis Pater, she called her with shouts where three or four roads meet; from this it has endured in her rites that on certain days a lamentation is raised at the crossroads everywhere by the \"matronae\".\"\nOvid likens Ceres' devotion to her own offspring to that of a cow to its calf; but she is also as the originator of bloody animal sacrifice, a necessity in the renewal of life. She has a particular enmity towards her own sacrificial animal, the pig. Pigs offend her by their destructive rooting-up of field crops under her protection; and in the myth of Proserpina's abduction on the plains of Henna (Enna), her tracks were obscured by their trampling. If not for them, Ceres might have been spared the toils and grief of her lengthy search and separation. Enna, in Sicily, had strong mythological connections with Ceres and Proserpina, and was the site of Ceres most ancient sanctuary. Flowers were said to bloom throughout the year on its \"miraculous plain\".\n\nVitruvius (c.80 – 15 BC) describes the \"Temple of Ceres near the Circus Maximus\" (her Aventine Temple) as typically Araeostyle, having widely spaced supporting columns, with architraves of wood, rather than stone. This species of temple is \"clumsy, heavy roofed, low and wide, [its] pediments ornamented with statues of clay or brass, gilt in the Tuscan fashion\". He recommends that temples to Ceres be sited in rural areas: \"in a solitary spot out of the city, to which the public are not necessarily led but for the purpose of sacrificing to her. This spot is to be reverenced with religious awe and solemnity of demeanour, by those whose affairs lead them to visit it.\" During the early Imperial era, soothsayers advised Pliny the Younger to restore an ancient, \"old and narrow\" temple to Ceres, at his rural property near Como. It contained an ancient wooden cult statue of the goddess, which he replaced. Though this was unofficial, private cult (\"sacra privata\") its annual feast on the Ides of September, the same day as the Epulum Jovis, was attended by pilgrims from all over the region. Pliny considered this rebuilding a fulfillment of his civic and religious duty.\n\nNo images of Ceres survive from her pre-Aventine cults; the earliest date to the middle Republic, and show the Hellenising influence of Demeter's iconography. Some late Republican images recall Ceres' search for Proserpina. Ceres bears a torch, sometimes two, and rides in a chariot drawn by snakes; or she sits on the sacred \"kiste\" (chest) that conceals the objects of her mystery rites. Sometimes she holds a caduceus, a symbol of Pax (Roman goddess of Peace). Augustan reliefs show her emergence, plant-like from the earth, her arms entwined by snakes, her outstretched hands bearing poppies and wheat, or her head crowned with fruits and vines. In free-standing statuary, she commonly wears a wheat-crown, or holds a wheat spray. Moneyers of the Republican era use Ceres' image, wheat ears and garlands to advertise their connections with prosperity, the annona and the popular interest. Some Imperial coin images depict important female members of the Imperial family as Ceres, or with some of her attributes.\n\nCeres was served by several public priesthoods. Some were male; her senior priest, the \"flamen cerialis\", also served Tellus and was usually plebeian by ancestry or adoption. Her public cult at the Ambarvalia, or \"perambulation of fields\" identified her with Dea Dia, and was led by the Arval Brethren (\"The Brothers of the Fields\"); rural versions of these rites were led as private cult by the heads of households. An inscription at Capua names a male \"sacerdos Cerialis mundalis\", a priest dedicated to Ceres' rites of the \"mundus\". The plebeian aediles had minor or occasional priestly functions at Ceres' Aventine Temple and were responsible for its management and financial affairs including collection of fines, the organisation of \"ludi Cerealia\" and probably the Cerealia itself. Their \"cure\" (care and jurisdiction) included, or came to include, the grain supply (\"annona\") and later the plebeian grain doles (\"frumentationes\"), the organisation and management of public games in general, and the maintenance of Rome's streets and public buildings.\n\nOtherwise, in Rome and throughout Italy, as at her ancient sanctuaries of Henna and Catena, Ceres' \"ritus graecus\" and her joint cult with Proserpina were invariably led by female \"sacerdotes\", drawn from local and Roman elites: Cicero notes that once the new cult had been founded, its earliest priestesses \"generally were either from Naples or Velia\", cities allied or federated to Rome. Elsewhere, he describes Ceres' Sicilian priestesses as \"older women respected for their noble birth and character\". Celibacy may have been a condition of their office; sexual abstinence was, according to Ovid, required of those attending Ceres' major, nine-day festival. Her public priesthood was reserved to respectable matrons, be they married, divorced or widowed. The process of their selection and their relationship to Ceres' older, entirely male priesthood is unknown; but they far outnumbered her few male priests, and would have been highly respected and influential figures in their own communities.\n\nRoman tradition credited Ceres' eponymous festival, Cerealia, to Rome's second king, the semi-legendary Numa. Ceres' senior, male priesthood was a minor flaminate whose priesthood and rites were supposedly also innovations of Numa. Her affinity and joint cult with Tellus, also known as Terra Mater (Mother Earth) may have developed at this time. Much later, during the early Imperial era, Ovid describes these goddesses as \"partners in labour\"; Ceres provides the \"cause\" for the growth of crops, while Tellus provides them a place to grow.\n\nIn 496 BC, against a background of economic recession and famine in Rome, imminent war against the Latins and a threatened secession by Rome's plebs (citizen commoners), the dictator A. Postumius vowed a temple to Ceres, Liber and Libera on or near the Aventine Hill. The famine ended and Rome's plebeian citizen-soldiery co-operated in the conquest of the Latins. Postumius' vow was fulfilled in 493 BC: Ceres became the central deity of the new Triad, housed in a new-built Aventine temple. She was also – or became – the patron goddess of the \"plebs\", whose enterprise as tenant farmers, estate managers, agricultural factors and importers was a mainstay of Roman agriculture.\n\nMuch of Rome's grain was imported from territories of Magna Graecia, particularly from Sicily, which later Roman mythographers describe as Ceres' \"earthly home\". Writers of the late Roman Republic and early Empire describe Ceres' Aventine temple and rites as conspicuously Greek. In modern scholarship, this is taken as further evidence of long-standing connections between the plebeians, Ceres and Magna Graecia. It also raises unanswered questions on the nature, history and character of these associations: the Triad itself may have been a self-consciously Roman cult formulation based on Greco-Italic precedents. To complicate matters further, when a new form of Cerean cult was officially imported from Magna Graecia, it was known as the \"ritus graecus\" (Greek rite) of Ceres, and was distinct from her older Roman rites.\n\nThe older forms of Aventine rites to Ceres remain uncertain. Most Roman cults were led by men, and the officiant's head was covered by a fold of his toga. In the Roman \"ritus graecus\", a male celebrant wore Greek-style vestments, and remained bareheaded before the deity, or else wore a wreath. While Ceres' original Aventine cult was led by male priests, her \"Greek rites\" (\"ritus graecus Cereris\") were exclusively female.\n\nTowards the end of the Second Punic War, around 205 BC, an officially recognised joint cult to Ceres and her daughter Proserpina was brought to Rome from southern Italy (part of Magna Graecia) along with Greek priestesses to serve it. In Rome, this was known as the \"ritus graecus Cereris\"; its priestesses were granted Roman citizenship so that they could pray to the gods \"with a foreign and external knowledge, but with a domestic and civil intention\". The cult was based on ancient, ethnically Greek cults to Demeter, most notably the Thesmophoria to Demeter and Persephone, whose cults and myths also provided a basis for the Eleusinian mysteries.\n\nFrom the end of the 3rd century BC, Demeter's temple at Enna, in Sicily, was acknowledged as Ceres' oldest, most authoritative cult centre, and Libera was recognised as Proserpina, Roman equivalent to Demeter's daughter Persephone. Their joint cult recalls Demeter's search for Persephone, after the latter's rape and abduction into the underworld by Hades. The new cult to \"mother and maiden\" took its place alongside the old, but made no reference to Liber. Thereafter, Ceres was offered two separate and distinctive forms of official cult at the Aventine. Both might have been supervised by the male flamen Cerialis but otherwise, their relationship is unclear. The older form of cult included both men and women, and probably remained a focus for plebeian political identity and discontent. The new identified its exclusively females initiates and priestesses as upholders of Rome's traditional, patrician-dominated social hierarchy and morality.\n\nA year after the import of the \"ritus cereris\", patrician senators imported cult to the Greek goddess Cybele and established her as Magna Mater (The Great Mother) within Rome's sacred boundary, facing the Aventine Hill. Like Ceres, Cybele was a form of Graeco-Roman earth goddess. Unlike her, she had mythological ties to Troy, and thus to the Trojan prince Aeneas, mythological ancestor of Rome's founding father and first patrician Romulus. The establishment of official Roman cult to Magna Mater coincided with the start of a new \"saeculum\" (cycle of years). It was followed by Hannibal's defeat, the end of the Punic War and an exceptionally good harvest. Roman victory and recovery could therefore be credited to Magna Mater and patrician piety: so the patricians dined her and each other at her festival banquets. In similar fashion, the plebeian nobility underlined their claims to Ceres. Up to a point, the two cults reflected a social and political divide, but when certain prodigies were interpreted as evidence of Ceres' displeasure, the senate appeased her with a new festival, the \"ieiunium Cereris\" (\"fast of Ceres\").\n\nIn 133 BC, the plebeian noble Tiberius Gracchus bypassed the Senate and appealed directly to the popular assembly to pass his proposed land-reforms. Civil unrest spilled into violence; Gracchus and many of his supporters were murdered by their conservative opponents. At the behest of the Sibylline oracle, the senate sent the quindecimviri to Ceres' ancient cult centre at Henna in Sicily, the goddess' supposed place of origin and earthly home. Some kind of religious consultation or propitiation was given, either to expiate Gracchus' murder – as later Roman sources would claim – or to justify it as the lawful killing of a would-be king or demagogue, a \"homo sacer\" who had offended Ceres' laws against tyranny.\n\nThe Eleusinian mysteries became increasingly popular during the late Republic. Early Roman initiates at Eleusis in Greece included Sulla and Cicero; thereafter many Emperors were initiated, including Hadrian, who founded an Eleusinian cult centre in Rome itself.\n\nIn Late Republican politics, aristocratic traditionalists and popularists used coinage to propagate their competing claims to Ceres' favour. A coin of Sulla shows Ceres on one side, and on the other a ploughman with yoked oxen: the images, accompanied by the legend \"conditor\", claim his rule (a military dictatorship) as regenerative and divinely justified. Popularists used her name and attributes to appeal their guardianship of plebeian interests, particularly the \"annona\" and \"frumentarium\"; and plebeian nobles and aediles used them to point out their ancestral connections with plebeians as commoners. In the decades of Civil War that ushered in the Empire, such images and dedications proliferate on Rome's coinage: Julius Caesar, his opponents, his assassins and his heirs alike claimed the favour and support of Ceres and her plebeian proteges, with coin issues that celebrate Ceres, \"Libertas\" (liberty) and Victoria (victory).\n\nImperial theology conscripted Rome's traditional cults as the divine upholders of Imperial Pax (peace) and prosperity, for the benefit of all. The emperor Augustus began the restoration of Ceres' Aventine Temple; his successor Tiberius completed it. Of the several figures on the Augustan Ara Pacis, one doubles as a portrait of the Empress Livia, who wears Ceres' \"corona spicea\". Another has been variously identified in modern scholarship as Tellus, Venus, Pax or Ceres, or in Spaeth's analysis, a deliberately broad composite of them all.\n\nThe emperor Claudius' reformed the grain supply and created its embodiment as an Imperial goddess, Annona, a junior partner to Ceres and the Imperial family. The traditional, Cerean virtues of provision and nourishment were symbolically extended to Imperial family members; some coinage shows Claudius' mother Antonia as an Augusta, wearing the \"corona spicea\".\n\nThe relationship between the reigning emperor, empress and Ceres was formalised in titles such as Augusta mater agrorum (\"The august mother of the fields) and \"Ceres Augusta\". On coinage, various emperors and empresses wear her \"corona spicea\", showing that the goddess, the emperor and his spouse are conjointly responsible for agricultural prosperity and the all-important provision of grain. A coin of Nerva (reigned AD 96–98) acknowledges Rome's dependence on the princeps' gift of \"frumentio\" (corn dole) to the masses. Under Nerva's later dynastic successor Antoninus Pius, Imperial theology represents the death and apotheosis of the Empress Faustina the Elder as Ceres' return to Olympus by Jupiter's command. Even then, \"her care for mankind continues and the world can rejoice in the warmth of her daughter Proserpina: in Imperial flesh, Proserpina is Faustina the Younger\", empress-wife of Pius' successor Marcus Aurelius.\n\nIn Britain, a soldier's inscription of the 2nd century AD attests to Ceres' role in the popular syncretism of the times. She is \"the bearer of ears of corn\", the \"Syrian Goddess\", identical with the universal heavenly Mother, the Magna Mater and Virgo, virgin mother of the gods. She is peace and virtue, and inventor of justice: she weighs \"Life and Right\" in her scale.\n\nDuring the Late Imperial era, Ceres gradually \"slips into obscurity\"; the last known official association of the Imperial family with her symbols is a coin issue of Septimius Severus (AD 193–211), showing his empress, Julia Domna, in the \"corona spicea\". After the reign of Claudius Gothicus, no coinage shows Ceres' image. Even so, an initiate of her mysteries is attested in the 5th century AD, after the official abolition of all non-Christian cults.\n\nThe word cereals derives from Ceres, commemorating her association with edible grains. Statues of Ceres top the domes of the Missouri State Capitol and the Vermont State House serving as a reminder of the importance of agriculture in the states' economies and histories. There is also a statue of her on top of the Chicago Board of Trade Building, which conducts trading in agricultural commodities.\n\nThe dwarf planet Ceres (discovered 1801), is named after this goddess. And in turn, the chemical element cerium (discovered 1803) was named after the dwarf planet. A poem about Ceres and humanity features in Dmitri's confession to his brother Alexei in Dostoevsky's \"The Brothers Karamazov\", Part 1, Book 3, Chapter 3.\n\nCeres appears as a character in William Shakespeare's play \"The Tempest\" (1611).\n\nAn aria in praise of Ceres is sung in Act 4 of the opera \"The Trojans\" by Hector Berlioz.\n\nThe 1937-1940 French 50 Francs bank note depicts Ceres in the Garden of Versailles.\n\nThe goddess Ceres is one of the three goddess offices held in The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry. The other goddesses are Pomona, and Flora.\n\nCeres is depicted on the Seal of New Jersey as a symbol of prosperity.\n\nCeres was depicted on several ten and twenty Confederate States of America dollar notes.\n\nYuu Watase's manga is titled \"Ayashi no Ceres\".\n\nA statue of Ceres stands at the top of the dome of the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City, Missouri.\n\n\n\n"}

He is celebrated for his principle — known as the Doppler effect — that the observed frequency of a wave depends on the relative speed of the source and the observer. He used this concept to explain the color of binary stars.\n\nChristian Doppler was born in Salzburg (today Austria) in 1803. After completing high school, Doppler studied philosophy in Salzburg and mathematics and physics at the Imperial–Royal Polytechnic Institute (now TU Wien), where he became an assistant in 1829. In 1835 he began work at the Prague Polytechnic (now Czech Technical University in Prague), where he received an appointment in 1841.\n\nOne year later, at the age of 38, Doppler gave a lecture to the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences and subsequently published his most notable work, \"Über das farbige Licht der Doppelsterne und einiger anderer Gestirne des Himmels\" \"(On the coloured light of the binary stars and some other stars of the heavens)\". There is a facsimile edition with an English translation by Alec Eden. In this work, Doppler postulated his principle (later coined the Doppler effect) that the observed frequency of a wave depends on the relative speed of the source and the observer, and he later tried to use this concept for explaining the colour of binary stars.\n\nThis was independently at the same time when physicist Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau () became also involved in aspects of the discovery of the Doppler effect, which is known by the French as the \"Doppler-Fizeau Effect\". Fizeau contributed towards understanding its effect with light rather than sound, and in doing so, corrected many of Doppler's persistent errors. He also developed the formal mathematical theorem underlying the principles of this effect. In 1848, he discovered the frequency shift of a wave when the source and receiver are moving relative to each other, therefore being the first to predict blue shifts and red shifts of light waves.\n\nDoppler continued working as a professor at the Prague Polytechnic, publishing over 50 articles on mathematics, physics and astronomy, but in 1847 he left Prague for the professorship of mathematics, physics, and mechanics at the Academy of Mines and Forests (its successor is the University of Miskolc) in Selmecbánya (then Kingdom of Hungary, now Banská Štiavnica, Slovakia),\n\nDoppler's research was interrupted by the revolutionary incidents of 1848. During the Hungarian Revolution, he fled to Vienna. There he was appointed head of the Institute for Experimental Physics at the University of Vienna in 1850. While there, Doppler, along with Franz Unger, influenced the development of young Gregor Mendel, the founding father of genetics, who was a student at the University of Vienna from 1851 to 1853.\n\nDoppler died on 17 March 1853 at age 49 from a pulmonary disease in Venice (at that time part of the Austrian Empire). His tomb, found by Dr. Peter M. Schuster is just inside the entrance of the Venetian island cemetery of San Michele.\n\nSome confusion exists about Doppler's full name. Doppler referred to himself as Christian Doppler. The records of his birth and baptism stated Christian \"Andreas\" Doppler. Forty years after Doppler's death the misnomer \"Johann\" Christian Doppler was introduced by the astronomer Julius Scheiner. Scheiner's mistake has since been copied by many.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19604228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19604228", "title": "Dark energy", "text": "Dark energy\n\nIn physical cosmology and astronomy, dark energy is an unknown form of energy which is hypothesized to permeate all of space, tending to accelerate the expansion of the universe. Dark energy is the most accepted hypothesis to explain the observations since the 1990s indicating that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate.\n\nAssuming that the standard model of cosmology is correct, the best current measurements indicate that dark energy contributes 68% of the total energy in the present-day observable universe. The mass–energy of dark matter and ordinary (baryonic) matter contribute 27% and 5%, respectively, and other components such as neutrinos and photons contribute a very small amount. The density of dark energy (~ 7 × 10 g/cm) is very low, much less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies. However, it dominates the mass–energy of the universe because it is uniform across space.\n\nTwo proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant, representing a constant energy density filling space homogeneously, and scalar fields such as quintessence or moduli, dynamic quantities whose energy density can vary in time and space. Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually also included in the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to the zero-point radiation of space i.e. the vacuum energy. Scalar fields that change in space can be difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant because the change may be extremely slow.\n\nThe \"cosmological constant\" is a constant term that can be added to Einstein's field equation of general relativity. If considered as a \"source term\" in the field equation, it can be viewed as equivalent to the mass of empty space (which conceptually could be either positive or negative), or \"vacuum energy\".\n\nThe cosmological constant was first proposed by Einstein as a mechanism to obtain a solution of the gravitational field equation that would lead to a static universe, effectively using dark energy to balance gravity. Einstein gave the cosmological constant the symbol Λ (capital lambda).\n\nThe mechanism was an example of fine-tuning, and it was later realized that Einstein's static universe would not be stable: local inhomogeneities would ultimately lead to either the runaway expansion or contraction of the universe. The equilibrium is unstable: if the universe expands slightly, then the expansion releases vacuum energy, which causes yet more expansion. Likewise, a universe which contracts slightly will continue contracting. These sorts of disturbances are inevitable, due to the uneven distribution of matter throughout the universe. Further, observations made by Edwin Hubble in 1929 showed that the universe appears to be expanding and not static at all. Einstein reportedly referred to his failure to predict the idea of a dynamic universe, in contrast to a static universe, as his greatest blunder.\n\nAlan Guth and Alexei Starobinsky proposed in 1980 that a negative pressure field, similar in concept to dark energy, could drive cosmic inflation in the very early universe. Inflation postulates that some repulsive force, qualitatively similar to dark energy, resulted in an enormous and exponential expansion of the universe slightly after the Big Bang. Such expansion is an essential feature of most current models of the Big Bang. However, inflation must have occurred at a much higher energy density than the dark energy we observe today and is thought to have completely ended when the universe was just a fraction of a second old. It is unclear what relation, if any, exists between dark energy and inflation. Even after inflationary models became accepted, the cosmological constant was thought to be irrelevant to the current universe.\n\nNearly all inflation models predict that the total (matter+energy) density of the universe should be very close to the critical density. During the 1980s, most cosmological research focused on models with critical density in matter only, usually 95% cold dark matter and 5% ordinary matter (baryons). These models were found to be successful at forming realistic galaxies and clusters, but some problems appeared in the late 1980s: in particular, the model required a value for the Hubble constant lower than preferred by observations, and the model under-predicted observations of large-scale galaxy clustering. These difficulties became stronger after the discovery of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background by the COBE spacecraft in 1992, and several modified CDM models came under active study through the mid-1990s: these included the Lambda-CDM model and a mixed cold/hot dark matter model. The first direct evidence for dark energy came from supernova observations in 1998 of accelerated expansion in Riess \"et al.\" and in Perlmutter \"et al.\", and the Lambda-CDM model then became the leading model. Soon after, dark energy was supported by independent observations: in 2000, the BOOMERanG and Maxima cosmic microwave background experiments observed the first acoustic peak in the CMB, showing that the total (matter+energy) density is close to 100% of critical density. Then in 2001, the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey gave strong evidence that the matter density is around 30% of critical. The large difference between these two supports a smooth component of dark energy making up the difference. Much more precise measurements from WMAP in 2003–2010 have continued to support the standard model and give more accurate measurements of the key parameters.\n\nThe term \"dark energy\", echoing Fritz Zwicky's \"dark matter\" from the 1930s, was coined by Michael Turner in 1998.\n\nHigh-precision measurements of the expansion of the universe are required to understand how the expansion rate changes over time and space. In general relativity, the evolution of the expansion rate is estimated from the curvature of the universe and the cosmological equation of state (the relationship between temperature, pressure, and combined matter, energy, and vacuum energy density for any region of space). Measuring the equation of state for dark energy is one of the biggest efforts in observational cosmology today. Adding the cosmological constant to cosmology's standard FLRW metric leads to the Lambda-CDM model, which has been referred to as the \"standard model of cosmology\" because of its precise agreement with observations.\n\nAs of 2013, the Lambda-CDM model is consistent with a series of increasingly rigorous cosmological observations, including the Planck spacecraft and the Supernova Legacy Survey. First results from the SNLS reveal that the average behavior (i.e., equation of state) of dark energy behaves like Einstein's cosmological constant to a precision of 10%. Recent results from the Hubble Space Telescope Higher-Z Team indicate that dark energy has been present for at least 9 billion years and during the period preceding cosmic acceleration.\n\nThe nature of dark energy is more hypothetical than that of dark matter, and many things about it remain matters of speculation. Dark energy is thought to be very homogeneous and not very dense, and is not known to interact through any of the fundamental forces other than gravity. Since it is quite rarefied and un-massive — roughly 10 kg/m — it is unlikely to be detectable in laboratory experiments. The reason dark energy can have such a profound effect on the universe, making up 68% of universal density in spite of being so dilute, is that it uniformly fills otherwise empty space.\n\nIndependently of its actual nature, dark energy would need to have a strong negative pressure (repulsive action), like radiation pressure in a metamaterial, to explain the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe. According to general relativity, the pressure within a substance contributes to its gravitational attraction for other objects just as its mass density does. This happens because the physical quantity that causes matter to generate gravitational effects is the stress–energy tensor, which contains both the energy (or matter) density of a substance and its pressure and viscosity. In the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric, it can be shown that a strong constant negative pressure in all the universe causes an acceleration in the expansion if the universe is already expanding, or a deceleration in contraction if the universe is already contracting. This accelerating expansion effect is sometimes labeled \"gravitational repulsion\".\n\nIn standard cosmology, there are three components of the universe: matter, radiation, and dark energy. Matter is anything whose energy density scales with the inverse cube of the scale factor, i.e., ρ ∝ a, while radiation is anything which scales to the inverse fourth power of the scale factor (ρ ∝ a). This can be understood intuitively: for an ordinary particle in a square box, doubling the length of a side of the box decreases the density (and hence energy density) by a factor of eight (2). For radiation, the decrease in energy density is greater, because an increase in spatial distance also causes a redshift.\n\nThe final component, dark energy, is an intrinsic property of space, and so has a constant energy density regardless of the volume under consideration (ρ ∝ a). Thus, unlike ordinary matter, it does not get diluted with the expansion of space.\n\nThe evidence for dark energy is indirect but comes from three independent sources:\n\n\nIn 1998, the High-Z Supernova Search Team published observations of Type Ia (\"one-A\") supernovae. In 1999, the Supernova Cosmology Project followed by suggesting that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. The 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Saul Perlmutter, Brian P. Schmidt, and Adam G. Riess for their leadership in the discovery.\n\nSince then, these observations have been corroborated by several independent sources. Measurements of the cosmic microwave background, gravitational lensing, and the large-scale structure of the cosmos, as well as improved measurements of supernovae, have been consistent with the Lambda-CDM model. Some people argue that the only indications for the existence of dark energy are observations of distance measurements and their associated redshifts. Cosmic microwave background anisotropies and baryon acoustic oscillations serve only to demonstrate that distances to a given redshift are larger than would be expected from a \"dusty\" Friedmann–Lemaître universe and the local measured Hubble constant.\n\nSupernovae are useful for cosmology because they are excellent standard candles across cosmological distances. They allow researchers to measure the expansion history of the universe by looking at the relationship between the distance to an object and its redshift, which gives how fast it is receding from us. The relationship is roughly linear, according to Hubble's law. It is relatively easy to measure redshift, but finding the distance to an object is more difficult. Usually, astronomers use standard candles: objects for which the intrinsic brightness, or absolute magnitude, is known. This allows the object's distance to be measured from its actual observed brightness, or apparent magnitude. Type Ia supernovae are the best-known standard candles across cosmological distances because of their extreme and consistent luminosity.\n\nRecent observations of supernovae are consistent with a universe made up 71.3% of dark energy and 27.4% of a combination of dark matter and baryonic matter.\n\nThe existence of dark energy, in whatever form, is needed to reconcile the measured geometry of space with the total amount of matter in the universe. Measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies indicate that the universe is close to flat. For the shape of the universe to be flat, the mass-energy density of the universe must be equal to the critical density. The total amount of matter in the universe (including baryons and dark matter), as measured from the CMB spectrum, accounts for only about 30% of the critical density. This implies the existence of an additional form of energy to account for the remaining 70%. The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) spacecraft seven-year analysis estimated a universe made up of 72.8% dark energy, 22.7% dark matter, and 4.5% ordinary matter.\nWork done in 2013 based on the Planck spacecraft observations of the CMB gave a more accurate estimate of 68.3% dark energy, 26.8% dark matter, and 4.9% ordinary matter.\n\nThe theory of large-scale structure, which governs the formation of structures in the universe (stars, quasars, galaxies and galaxy groups and clusters), also suggests that the density of matter in the universe is only 30% of the critical density.\n\nA 2011 survey, the WiggleZ galaxy survey of more than 200,000 galaxies, provided further evidence towards the existence of dark energy, although the exact physics behind it remains unknown. The WiggleZ survey from the Australian Astronomical Observatory scanned the galaxies to determine their redshift. Then, by exploiting the fact that baryon acoustic oscillations have left voids regularly of ~150 Mpc diameter, surrounded by the galaxies, the voids were used as standard rulers to estimate distances to galaxies as far as 2,000 Mpc (redshift 0.6), allowing for accurate estimate of the speeds of galaxies from their redshift and distance. The data confirmed cosmic acceleration up to half of the age of the universe (7 billion years) and constrain its inhomogeneity to 1 part in 10. This provides a confirmation to cosmic acceleration independent of supernovae.\n\nAccelerated cosmic expansion causes gravitational potential wells and hills to flatten as photons pass through them, producing cold spots and hot spots on the CMB aligned with vast supervoids and superclusters. This so-called late-time Integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect (ISW) is a direct signal of dark energy in a flat universe. It was reported at high significance in 2008 by Ho \"et al.\" and Giannantonio \"et al.\"\n\nA new approach to test evidence of dark energy through observational Hubble constant data (OHD) has gained significant attention in recent years. The Hubble constant, \"H\"(\"z\"), is measured as a function of cosmological redshift. OHD directly tracks the expansion history of the universe by taking passively evolving early-type galaxies as “cosmic chronometers”. From this point, this approach provides standard clocks in the universe. The core of this idea is the measurement of the differential age evolution as a function of redshift of these cosmic chronometers. Thus, it provides a direct estimate of the Hubble parameter\n\nThe reliance on a differential quantity, , can minimize many common issues and systematic effects; and as a direct measurement of the Hubble parameter instead of its integral, like supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), it brings more information and is appealing in computation. For these reasons, it has been widely used to examine the accelerated cosmic expansion and study properties of dark energy.\n\nDark energy's status as a hypothetical force with unknown properties makes it a very active target of research. The problem is attacked from a great variety of angles, such as modifying the prevailing theory of gravity (general relativity), attempting to pin down the properties of dark energy, and finding alternative ways to explain the observational data.\n\nThe simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is an intrinsic, fundamental energy of space. This is the cosmological constant, usually represented by the Greek letter Λ (Lambda, hence Lambda-CDM model). Since energy and mass are related according to the equation \"E\" = \"mc\", Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that this energy will have a gravitational effect. It is sometimes called a vacuum energy because it is the energy density of empty vacuum.\n\nThe cosmological constant has negative pressure equal to its energy density and so causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate. The reason a cosmological constant has negative pressure can be seen from classical thermodynamics. In general, energy must be lost from inside a container (the container must do work on its environment) in order for the volume to increase. Specifically, a change in volume \"dV\" requires work done equal to a change of energy −\"P dV\", where \"P\" is the pressure. But the amount of energy in a container full of vacuum actually increases when the volume increases, because the energy is equal to \"ρV\", where \"ρ\" is the energy density of the cosmological constant. Therefore, \"P\" is negative and, in fact, \"P\" = −\"ρ\".\n\nThere are two major advantages for the cosmological constant. The first is that it is simple. Einstein had in fact introduced this term in his original formulation of general relativity such as to get a static universe. Although he later discarded the term after Hubble found that the universe is expanding, a nonzero cosmological constant can act as dark energy, without otherwise changing the Einstein field equations. The other advantage is that there is a natural explanation for its origin. Most quantum field theories predict vacuum fluctuations that would give the vacuum this sort of energy. This is related to the Casimir effect, in which there is a small suction into regions where virtual particles are geometrically inhibited from forming (e.g. between plates with tiny separation).\n\nA major outstanding problem is that the same quantum field theories predict a huge cosmological constant, more than 100 orders of magnitude too large. This would need to be almost, but not exactly, cancelled by an equally large term of the opposite sign. Some supersymmetric theories require a cosmological constant that is exactly zero, which does not help because supersymmetry must be broken.\n\nNonetheless, the cosmological constant is the most economical solution to the problem of cosmic acceleration. Thus, the current standard model of cosmology, the Lambda-CDM model, includes the cosmological constant as an essential feature.\n\nIn quintessence models of dark energy, the observed acceleration of the scale factor is caused by the potential energy of a dynamical field, referred to as quintessence field. Quintessence differs from the cosmological constant in that it can vary in space and time. In order for it not to clump and form structure like matter, the field must be very light so that it has a large Compton wavelength.\n\nNo evidence of quintessence is yet available, but it has not been ruled out either. It generally predicts a slightly slower acceleration of the expansion of the universe than the cosmological constant. Some scientists think that the best evidence for quintessence would come from violations of Einstein's equivalence principle and variation of the fundamental constants in space or time. Scalar fields are predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics and string theory, but an analogous problem to the cosmological constant problem (or the problem of constructing models of cosmological inflation) occurs: renormalization theory predicts that scalar fields should acquire large masses.\n\nThe coincidence problem asks why the acceleration of the Universe began when it did. If acceleration began earlier in the universe, structures such as galaxies would never have had time to form, and life, at least as we know it, would never have had a chance to exist. Proponents of the anthropic principle view this as support for their arguments. However, many models of quintessence have a so-called \"tracker\" behavior, which solves this problem. In these models, the quintessence field has a density which closely tracks (but is less than) the radiation density until matter-radiation equality, which triggers quintessence to start behaving as dark energy, eventually dominating the universe. This naturally sets the low energy scale of the dark energy.\n\nIn 2004, when scientists fit the evolution of dark energy with the cosmological data, they found that the equation of state had possibly crossed the cosmological constant boundary (w = −1) from above to below. A No-Go theorem has been proved that gives this scenario at least two degrees of freedom as required for dark energy models. This scenario is so-called Quintom scenario.\n\nSome special cases of quintessence are phantom energy, in which the energy density of quintessence actually increases with time, and k-essence (short for kinetic quintessence) which has a non-standard form of kinetic energy such as a negative kinetic energy. They can have unusual properties: phantom energy, for example, can cause a Big Rip.\n\nThis class of theories attempts to come up with an all-encompassing theory of both dark matter and dark energy as a single phenomenon that modifies the laws of gravity at various scales. This could, for example, treat dark energy and dark matter as different facets of the same unknown substance, or postulate that cold dark matter decays into dark energy. Another class of theories that unifies dark matter and dark energy are suggested to be covariant theories of modified gravities. These theories alter the dynamics of the space-time such that the modified dynamic stems what have been assigned to the presence of dark energy and dark matter.\n\nThe density of dark energy might have varied in time over the history of the universe. Modern observational data allow for estimates of the present density. Using baryon acoustic oscillations, it is possible to investigate the effect of dark energy in the history of the Universe, and constrain parameters of the equation of state of dark energy. To that end, several models have been proposed. One of the most popular models is the Chevallier–Polarski–Linder model (CPL). Some other common models are, (Barboza & Alcaniz. 2008), (Jassal et al. 2005), (Wetterich. 2004),(Oztas et al. 2018).\n\nSome alternatives to dark energy aim to explain the observational data by a more refined use of established theories. In this scenario, dark energy doesn't actually exist, and is merely a measurement artifact. For example, if we are located in an emptier-than-average region of space, the observed cosmic expansion rate could be mistaken for a variation in time, or acceleration. A different approach uses a cosmological extension of the equivalence principle to show how space might appear to be expanding more rapidly in the voids surrounding our local cluster. While weak, such effects considered cumulatively over billions of years could become significant, creating the illusion of cosmic acceleration, and making it appear as if we live in a Hubble bubble. Yet other possibilities are that the accelerated expansion of the universe is an illusion caused by the relative motion of us to the rest of the universe, or that the supernovae sample size used wasn't large enough.\n\nThe evidence for dark energy is heavily dependent on the theory of general relativity. Therefore, it is conceivable that a modification to general relativity also eliminates the need for dark energy. There are very many such theories, and research is ongoing. The measurement of the speed of gravity in the first gravitational wave measured by non-gravitational means (GW170817) ruled out many modified gravity theories as explanations to dark energy.\n\nAstrophysicist Ethan Siegel states that, while such alternatives gain a lot of mainstream press coverage, almost all professional astrophysicists are confident that dark energy exists, and that none of the competing theories successfully explain observations to the same level of precision as standard dark energy.\n\nCosmologists estimate that the acceleration began roughly 5 billion years ago. Before that, it is thought that the expansion was decelerating, due to the attractive influence of matter. The density of dark matter in an expanding universe decreases more quickly than dark energy, and eventually the dark energy dominates. Specifically, when the volume of the universe doubles, the density of dark matter is halved, but the density of dark energy is nearly unchanged (it is exactly constant in the case of a cosmological constant).\n\nProjections into the future can differ radically for different models of dark energy. For a cosmological constant, or any other model that predicts that the acceleration will continue indefinitely, the ultimate result will be that galaxies outside the Local Group will have a line-of-sight velocity that continually increases with time, eventually far exceeding the speed of light. This is not a violation of special relativity because the notion of \"velocity\" used here is different from that of velocity in a local inertial frame of reference, which is still constrained to be less than the speed of light for any massive object (see Uses of the proper distance for a discussion of the subtleties of defining any notion of relative velocity in cosmology). Because the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time, there can actually be cases where a galaxy that is receding from us faster than light does manage to emit a signal which reaches us eventually. However, because of the accelerating expansion, it is projected that most galaxies will eventually cross a type of cosmological event horizon where any light they emit past that point will never be able to reach us at any time in the infinite future because the light never reaches a point where its \"peculiar velocity\" toward us exceeds the expansion velocity away from us (these two notions of velocity are also discussed in Uses of the proper distance). Assuming the dark energy is constant (a cosmological constant), the current distance to this cosmological event horizon is about 16 billion light years, meaning that a signal from an event happening \"at present\" would eventually be able to reach us in the future if the event were less than 16 billion light years away, but the signal would never reach us if the event were more than 16 billion light years away.\n\nAs galaxies approach the point of crossing this cosmological event horizon, the light from them will become more and more redshifted, to the point where the wavelength becomes too large to detect in practice and the galaxies appear to vanish completely (\"see\" Future of an expanding universe). Planet Earth, the Milky Way, and the Local Group of which the Milky way is a part, would all remain virtually undisturbed as the rest of the universe recedes and disappears from view. In this scenario, the Local Group would ultimately suffer heat death, just as was hypothesized for the flat, matter-dominated universe before measurements of cosmic acceleration.\n\nThere are other, more speculative ideas about the future of the universe. The phantom energy model of dark energy results in \"divergent\" expansion, which would imply that the effective force of dark energy continues growing until it dominates all other forces in the universe. Under this scenario, dark energy would ultimately tear apart all gravitationally bound structures, including galaxies and solar systems, and eventually overcome the electrical and nuclear forces to tear apart atoms themselves, ending the universe in a \"Big Rip\". It is also possible the universe may never have an end and continue in its present state forever (see The second thermodynamics law as a law of disorder). On the other hand, dark energy might dissipate with time or even become attractive. Such uncertainties leave open the possibility that gravity might yet rule the day and lead to a universe that contracts in on itself in a \"Big Crunch\", or that there may even be a dark energy cycle, which implies a cyclic model of the universe in which every iteration (Big Bang then eventually a Big Crunch) takes about a trillion (10) years. While none of these are supported by observations, they are not ruled out.\n\nIn philosophy of science, dark energy is an example of an \"auxiliary hypothesis\", an ad hoc postulate that is added to a theory in response to observations that falsify it. It has been argued that the dark energy hypothesis is a conventionalist hypothesis, that is, a hypothesis that adds no empirical content and hence is unfalsifiable in the sense defined by Karl Popper.\n\n"}

For instance, many organisms build, choose or provision nursery environments, such as nests, for their offspring. The recurrence of traits across life cycles results in part from parents constructing developmental conditions for their descendants. Richard Lewontin stresses how by modifying the availability of biotic and abiotic resources, niche-constructing organisms can cause organisms to coevolve with their environments. \n\nEcological inheritance has significant implications for macroevolution. Ancestral species may modify environments through their niche construction that may have consequences for other species, sometimes millions of years later. For instance, cyanobacteria produced oxygen as a waste product of photosynthesis (see great oxygenation event), which dramatically changed the composition of the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans, with vast macroevolutionary consequences.\n\nIn recent years, many evolutionary biologists have sought to expand the concept of inheritance within evolutionary biology, and ecological inheritance is now commonly incorporated into these schemes. The evolutionary significance of ecological inheritance, however, remains disputed.\n\n"}

ArcGIS also includes developer products and web services. In a general sense, the term GIS describes any information system that integrates, stores, edits, analyzes, shares and displays geographic information for informing decision making. The term GIS-Centric, however, has been specifically defined as the use of the Esri ArcGIS geodatabase as the asset and feature data repository central to computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) as a part of enterprise asset management and analytical software systems. GIS-centric certification criteria have been specifically defined by NAGCS, the National Association of GIS-Centric Solutions.\n\nAs of February 2018, the company's desktop GIS suite is ArcGIS for Desktop version 10.6. ArcGIS for Desktop consists of several integrated applications, including ArcMap, ArcCatalog, ArcToolbox, ArcScene, ArcGlobe, and ArcGIS Pro. The suite's main components, ArcMap, ArcCatalog and ArcToolbox, allow users to author, analyze, map, manage, share, and publish geographic information. The product suite is available in three levels of licensing: Basic (formerly called ArcView), Standard (formerly called ArcEditor) and Advanced (formerly called ArcInfo). Basic (ArcView) provides a basic set of GIS capabilities suitable for many GIS applications. Standard (ArcEditor), at added cost, allows more extensive data editing and manipulation, including server geodatabase editing.

It is the first of the two stages of the Terreneuvian series. Its base is defined as the first appearance of the trace fossil \"Treptichnus pedum\" million years ago. The top of the Fortunian which is the base of the Stage 2 of the Cambrian has not been formally defined yet, but will correspond to the appearance of an Archeocyatha species or \"Small shelly fossils\" approximately million years ago.\n\nThe name Fortunian is derived from a part of the Burin Peninsula, the town of Fortune near the GSSP and Fortune Bay.\n\nThe type locality (GSSP) of the Fortunian stage is in Fortune Head, at the northern edge of the Burin Peninsula, Newfoundland, Canada (). This GSSP coincides with the beginning of the Terreneuvian series, the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary and the beginning of the Phanerozoic. The outcrops show a carbonate-siliciclastic succession which is mapped as the Chapel Island Formation. The formation is divided into the following members that are composed of peritidal sandstones and shales (Member 1), muddy deltaic and shelf sandstones and mudstones (Member 2A), laminated siltstones (Member 2B and 3) and mudstones and limestones of the inner shelf (Member 4). The Precambrian-Cambrian boundary lies 2.4 m above the base of the 2nd member which is the lowest occurrence of \"Treptichnus pedum\". The traces can be seen on the lower surface of the sandstone layers. The first calcareous shelled skeletal fossils \"(Ladatheca cylindrica)\" is 400 m above the boundary. The first trilobites appear 1400 m above the boundary which corresponds to the beginning of the Branchian Series.\n\n\n"}

North of Goyder's Line, annual rainfall is usually too low to support cropping, with the land being only suitable for grazing. Related to that, the line also marks a distinct change in vegetation. To the south, it is composed mainly of mallee scrub, whilst saltbush predominates to the north of the line.\n\nWith barely 30 years' knowledge of this new country, farmers needed reliable information about the climate and growing conditions. In 1865 George Goyder, the then Surveyor-General of the colony, was asked to map the boundary between those areas that received good rainfall and those experiencing drought. After traversing an estimated 3200 km on horseback (not including the Eyre Peninsula) in November 1865, he submitted his report and map to the state government on 6 December. The map included a line of demarcation, the areas north of which being those Goyder judged \"liable to drought\", with the areas to the south deemed arable. He discouraged farmers from planting crops north of his line, declaring this land suitable only for light grazing. Goyder's report was based on the information already in his office, supplemented by the observations made during the 1865 journey to observe the effects of drought. He was guided in drawing the line by the changes in vegetation, especially various kinds of saltbush.\n\nAmple rains fell in 1865, prompting farmers to ignore Goyder's report and settle in the north, starting farms and planting crops. The idea that rain follows the plow, developed during the contemporaneous westward expansion of cropping in the United States, encouraged this trend. A few years later, many had to abandon their properties. The land was indeed unsuitable for crops, and Goyder was proved correct. Many farmhouse ruins can still be seen in the vicinity of Goyder's line.\n\nGoyder's Line was embodied in Schedule 1 of the \"Waste Lands Alienation Act 1872\" which prohibited purchase of land on credit outside of designated agricultural areas. However a few good seasons led to the repeal of that act in 1874.\n\nThere were other periods of development north of the line but, invariably, adverse conditions proved decisive. Entire towns and farms were abandoned when there was a return to longer-term average rainfall patterns. The line has proven highly accurate, a notable feat given the relatively limited knowledge of the local climate at the time it was surveyed.\n\nIn December 2015, climate scientist Peter Hayman acknowledged that the current \"warming, drying trend\" of South Australia's climate would definitely \"put a downward shift on Goyder's Line\" towards the south.\n\nGoyder's Line starts on the west coast near Ceduna and runs south-east across the Eyre Peninsula to strike Spencer Gulf near Arno Bay. It continues from near Moonta north to Crystal Brook and Orroroo, then south-east past Peterborough and Burra to the Victorian border near Pinnaroo, crossing the Murray River south of Blanchetown. Agriculture is possible north of the line near the Murray River, only because of irrigation using water drawn from the river.\n\nWhen flying over the area, the distinct change in flora makes it possible to see the approximate path of Goyder's Line.\n\nGoyder's Line became a National Trust of Australia Heritage Icon in 2003.\n\nThe Goyder Line was also mentioned in the Redgum song \"Virgin Ground\" from the 1980 album of the same name, and in the song \"Spark of the Heart\", from their 1984 album \"Frontline\".\n\nOther states have similar conditions where parts of a state are arable but other parts are suitable only for pastoral grazing, however no other state has a surveyed line equivalent to Goyder's line.\n\n\n\n"}

The coal-fired power plant, located across the Clinch River from the city of Kingston, uses ponds to dewater the fly ash, a byproduct of coal combustion, which is then stored in wet form in dredge cells. The slurry (a mixture of fly ash and water) traveled across the Emory River and its Swan Pond embayment, on to the opposite shore, covering up to of the surrounding land, damaging homes and flowing up and down stream in nearby waterways such as the Emory River and Clinch River (tributaries of the Tennessee River). It was the largest fly ash release in United States history.\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initially estimated that the spill released 1.7 million cubic yards (1.3 million m³) of sludge, which is gray in color. After an aerial survey, the official estimate was more than tripled to 5.4 million cubic yards (4 million m³) on December 25, 2008. The spill covered surrounding land with up to six feet (1.8 m) of sludge. The EPA first estimated that the spill would take four to six weeks to clean up; however, Chandra Taylor, the staff attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the cleanup could take months and possibly years. As of June 2009, six months following the spill, only 3% of the spill had been cleaned and is now estimated to cost between $675 and $975 million to clean, according to the TVA.\n\nThe unlined aboveground ash fill, which was situated above the ash pond and above the Emory River winter level, above sea level, contained a watery slurry of fly ash generated by the burning of finely ground coal at the steam power plant. Fly ash is the fine particulate pollutants produced by the combustion of coal, which are collected rather than allowing them to escape into the atmosphere, then mixed with water so they can be pumped into the retaining pond. Once the particulate matter settles out, it is dredged to drying cells. The dredge cell was surrounded by tall earthen walls, which had twice developed leaks since 2002. Although the land surrounding the power plant is largely rural rather than residential, the spill caused a mudflow wave of water and ash that covered 12 homes, pushing one entirely off its foundation, rendering three uninhabitable, and caused some damage to 42 residential properties. It also washed out a road, ruptured a major gas line, obstructed a rail line, downed trees, broke a water main, and destroyed power lines. Though 22 residences were evacuated, nobody was reported to be injured or in need of hospitalization. It was the largest coal-related slurry spill in United States history, more than three times the size of the Martin County sludge spill of 2000, which spilled of liquid coal waste. The of sludge were enough to fill 1,660 Olympic-size swimming pools, and the volume released was about 101 times larger than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill (1.1 billion/10.9 million=100.9). On December 23, 2008, a TVA spokesman, Gil Francis Jr., stated that, at the time of the spill, the area contained about 2.6 million cubic yards (2.2 million m³) of ash, and that two-thirds of that had been released, which would later be found to cover an area of . \"The New York Times\" noted that the amount spilled is larger than the amount stated to have been in the pond before the spill, a discrepancy the TVA was unable to explain. The containment area affected was one of three; the other two stayed intact, while only the retaining wall for the solid waste containment area was affected.\nThe spill killed a \"tremendous\" number of fish, according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press. Although residents feared water contamination, early tests of water six miles (10 km) upstream of the ash flow showed that the public water supply met drinking water standards. A test of river water near the spill showed elevated levels of lead and thallium, and \"barely detectable\" levels of mercury and arsenic. On January 1, 2009 the first independent test results, conducted at the Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry laboratories at Appalachian State University, showed significantly elevated levels of toxic metals (including arsenic, copper, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, and thallium) in samples of slurry and river water.\n\nThe Kingston Fossil Plant received a total of of rain between December 1 and December 22, plus on November 29 and 30. This rain combined with temperatures were identified by TVA as factors that contributed to the failure of the earthen embankment. An October 2008 inspection report had identified a \"minor leak\" in the faulty wall, but the report was not finalized. Local residents said that the spill was not a unique occurrence; the 1960s-era pond had been observed leaking, and being repaired, nearly every year since 2001. A TVA news release confirmed that there had been two prior cases of seepage, in 2003 and 2006.\n\nTVA spokesman Gil Francis Jr. said that the TVA was \"taking steps to stabilize runoff from this incident.\" In response to a video that showed dead fish on the Clinch River, which had received runoff from the spill, he stated \"in terms of toxicity, until an analysis comes in, you can't call it toxic.\" He continued by saying that \"it does have some heavy metals within it, but it's not toxic or anything.\" Chandra Taylor, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, called this statement irresponsible, and stated that coal fly ash contains concentrated amounts of mercury, arsenic, and benzene. She added, \"These things are naturally occurring, but they concentrate in the burning process and the residual is more toxic than it starts.\" Nevertheless, due to pressure exerted in 2000 by utilities, the coal industry, and Clinton administration officials, fly ash is not strictly regulated as a toxic pollutant by the EPA. Residents and environmental groups expressed concern that the fly ash slurry could become more dangerous once it dries out, but have as yet received no information about this from the TVA. On January 1, 2009, the TVA disseminated a fact sheet stating that the ash is \"not hazardous.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the EPA and Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation awaited the results of soil and water testing to judge their response, while the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency indicated that barriers would be constructed to stop the ash from reaching the Tennessee River. By early on December 24, 2008, a flyover by \"The New York Times\" did note repair work being done on the nearby railroad, which had been obstructed when of sludge covered tracks. By the afternoon of that day, dump trucks were being used to deposit rock into the Clinch River to prevent the further downstream contamination. The TVA had also slowed river flow, for the same purpose. The slurry that was cleared from Swan Pond Road was brought back to one of the plant's intact containment ponds. By December 30, 2008, the TVA had announced it was requesting the assistance of the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the ash-filled Emory River to restore navigation. On January 1, 2009 the TVA announced that rather than attempting to clear away all the slurry, they would be spraying seed, straw, and mulch on top of much of it, \"to combat dust and erosion\".\n\nLisa Evans, an attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice (headquartered in Oakland, CA), spoke out against the government, accusing them of lax regulations on the issue. She also blamed the industry for ineffective safeguards, citing other similar cases. She stated that \"The saddest thing is this is entirely avoidable. These people in these communities don't have to be in harm's way. This is not some complicated problem like nuclear waste. This is something the utilities know how to do.\" Thomas J. FitzGerald, the director of the environmental group Kentucky Resources Council and an expert on coal waste, told \"The New York Times\" that the ash should have been buried in lined landfills to prevent toxins leaching into the soil and groundwater (as recommended in a 2006 EPA report), and stated that \"I find it difficult to comprehend that the State of Tennessee would have approved that as a permanent disposal site.\" Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen, on-site the week of the spill, acknowledged that the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, which regulates coal disposal, may have relied too much on TVA's own inspections and engineering studies about the ash ponds and dredge cells.\"Believe me, there will be a full-bore look at this to understand the causes of this thing and to try to make sure it never happens again,\" he said. Concern has also been expressed by environmental groups and local residents that no warnings were issued to residents living in the area about the potential dangers of the site. On December 27, 2008 the TVA issued a list of precautions to residents, but did not provide information about specific levels of toxic materials in the ash, although Stephen Smith of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Chris Irwin of United Mountain Defense told \"The Tennessean\" newspaper that they believe the TVA knows what is in it, due to the TVA having tested it prior to the spill. The TVA released an inventory of the plant's byproducts on December 29, 2008; it included arsenic, lead, barium, chromium, and manganese. Because the pond contained decades worth of ash from coal of several different types, it is believed that the area of the spill may contain \"hot spots\" of higher toxicity.\n\nIn response to independent attempts at sampling of the water quality and the taking of photos, the TVA illegally detained, for approximately one hour, two members of the Knoxville, Tennessee-based environmental organization United Mountain Defense who were traversing public land in the area of the spill, and cited three other individuals, warning them that any attempt to enter the public waterway again would lead to prosecution.\n\nTVA president Tom Kilgore said that, in light of the spill, the Authority would consider switching the Kingston plant over to \"dry\" byproduct methods, which would reduce the chances of another spill. Five TVA-operated plants use this method, while Kingston and another five use a \"wet\" process. The power plant continues to operate, with waste being sent to one of the two remaining intact containment ponds.\n\nOn December 26, 2008 the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation stated that it was satisfied with the water quality in the wake of the spill but that it will continue to examine and deal with the potential for chronic health effects. Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen toured the spill site on December 31, 2008. The U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees the TVA, held a hearing on January 8 to examine the disaster. The environmental activist Erin Brockovich was invited to Tennessee to survey the disaster site, and announced plans to visit during the second week of January 2009.\n\nAt her Senate confirmation hearing on January 14, 2009, Lisa P. Jackson, Barack Obama's choice to head the EPA under his administration, stated her intention to immediately review coal ash disposal sites across the country. Also on January 14, 2009, Nick J. Rahall, a U.S. Representative from West Virginia and the chairman of the United States House Committee on Natural Resources, introduced a bill to regulate coal ash disposal sites across the United States.\n\nOn December 23, 2008 the environmental group Greenpeace asked for a criminal investigation into the incident, focusing on whether the TVA could have prevented the spill. On December 30, 2008 a group of landowners filed suit against the TVA for $165 million in Tennessee state court. Also on December 30, 2008 the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy announced its intention to sue the TVA under the federal Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.\n\n\"On February 4, 2009, EPA, pursuant to Executive Order 12088, and TDEC issued a letter to TVA in which EPA provided notice to TVA that EPA considers the release to be an unpermitted discharge of a pollutant in contravention of the Clean Water Act.\"\n\nOn May 11, 2009 \"TVA and the federal Environmental Protection Agency announced today an EPA Order and Agreement that documents the relationship between TVA and EPA in managing the clean-up of the Kingston ash spill and further ensures that TVA will meet all federal and state environmental requirements in restoring affected areas.\"\n\nThe primary objective of the time-critical phase of the EPA Order was to expedite the removal of ash from the Emory River. The ash resided in the Emory River subject to significant migration in heavy storms. Over 3.5 million cubic yards were removed in a 12-month period, with 85% being removed in a 10-month time frame. The time-critical phase accelerated the removal of ash from the river by 75% over original expectations and safely transported it to a permanent, lined and leachate collecting facility in Perry County, Alabama called Arrowhead landfill. Arrowhead landfill is located on a thick layer of Selma chalk. Significant benefits were derived by the receiving community in both jobs and county improvements. The once-closed Emory River was reopened in late spring 2010 and has been reopened for full community use with only minor wake zone restrictions. Drinking water continues to remain safe for consumption, and air quality associated with the site continues to meet federal standards. The time-critical phase removed 90% of the ash located in the Emory River, leaving about 500,000 cubic yards of material which will be addressed in the next phase of the clean-up. A more comprehensive report of the actions was finalized in March 2011 and can be found at EPA OSC Report for the Time Critical Removal Action \nIn August 2010, the non-time-critical phase began removing ash from the remaining, more contained embayment and began preparations for closing out the failed dredge cell with an earthquake-proof subsurface wall and cap. In addition, the non-time-critical phase is conducting ecological evaluations concerning the remaining risks of the ash in the river.\n\nCritics of the EPA's response claim the solution was an act of environmental racism. Roane county's population is 91% Caucasian. The EPA shipped the toxic coal ash 300 miles to Uniontown, Alabama, which has a population that is 88% African American. Dr. Robert Bullard, a champion for the victims of environmental racism, claims that the EPA's response was a prioritization of the health of Caucasian Americans over the health of African Americans.The coal ash incident is often used in comparison to the Flint water crisis in Flint, Michigan.\n\nA number of workers suffered health effects in the years following the spill at the cleanup site. A federal jury ruled in favor of the workers seeking compensation in November 2018. The plaintiffs alleged contractor Jacobs Engineering for failing to keep workers safe from environmental hazards.\n\nAccording to the AECOM report commissioned by TVA and released June 25, 2009, failure occurred due to a variety of causes, primarily due to liquefaction of layers of \"slimes\" and other water-saturated materials deep within the growing ash pile. Collapse occurred over the course of approximately one hour in consecutive waves of breaking away and sliding.\n\nThe Kingston Fossil Plant is located on a peninsula at the junction of the Emory River (to the north) and Clinch River (to the south and east), just over upstream from the latter's mouth along the Tennessee River. Watts Bar Dam, located along the Tennessee downstream from the mouth of the Clinch, impounds a reservoir (Watts Bar Lake) that spans a stretch of the Tennessee (to Fort Loudoun Dam), the lower of the Clinch (to Melton Hill Dam), and the lower of the Emory. The plant, originally known as the Kingston Steam Plant, was built in the early 1950s primarily to provide electricity to atomic energy installations at nearby Oak Ridge.\n\nThe plant's ash pond disposal area is located immediately north of the plant along the peninsula's Emory River shore. The ponds were originally created by diking off part of the lake at the Emory's confluence with Swan Pond Creek, which flows down from Harriman (just over the ridge to the northwest). The disposal area consists of the main ash pond (where ash is initially dumped), which is flanked on the southeast by a stilling pond (where water from the main pond is placed to further separate it from the ash) and on the northwest by \"dredge cells,\" where ash from the main pond is placed to further solidify. The dike breach occurred at the northwest corner of the dredge cell area, overlooking the Swan Pond Creek spillway.\n\n\n\n"}

He is also an engineer and businessman.\n\nEstablished in business, Mahmudur Rahman was appointed the executive chairman of the National Investment Board in 2002, and then elevated to national energy adviser in 2005. In both positions, Rahman set high goals for attracting foreign investments and increasing energy capacity in Bangladesh. While he had success in attracting foreign investors, he also took controversial steps such as increasing petrol prices or developing open-pit mines that set off protests across the country.\n\nSince the restoration of civilian government and the Awami League victory in 2008, Rahman has been a strong critic of the government through his newspaper. Party and government officials have reacted by charging him with defamation and sedition cases more than 50 times since 2009 to 2013. He is the only person to be sentenced for contempt by the Bangladesh Supreme Court. International human rights groups and press organisations have characterised the government's actions against him as judicial harassment. Critics have said he has misrepresented bloggers and activists associated with the 2013 Shahbag protests and contributed to widespread religious tensions and civil unrest.\n\nMahmudur Rahman was born in Comilla, Bangladesh, his mother is Mahmuda Begum. He received his Bachelor of Chemical Engineering in 1977 from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. After working in engineering in Japan, he returned to earn a graduate diploma in Ceramic Engineering. He also earned an M.B.A. from the Institute of Business Administration, Dhaka University.\n\nHe married Firoza Khan, the daughter of Harunur Rashid Khan Monno. The latter has been politically affiliated with the BNP since independence.\n\nRahman started his career as an operational engineer at British Oxygen, a major British-owned gas company. He also worked in Munnu Ceramics, Duncan Brothers, Shinepukur Ceramics, Beximco Group, and Padma Textile, including some years in Japan.\n\nAfter returning to Bangladesh, Rahman started and developed his own company, Artisan Ceramics Limited in 1999. It was the first bone china plant in the country and a technological breakthrough. Artisan Ceramics was sold in 2013.\n\nRahman was appointed by the administration of Khaleda Zia as chair of the National Investment Board. In 2002, he described the obstacles to foreign investment in Bangladesh as the \"five 'I's\": \"image, information, infrastructure, implementation and inefficiency\" and committed the government to achieving change. He credited the opening of the power plant Meghna Energy Limited in Kanchpur, to the government's energy deregulation. Between 2002 and 2003, foreign investment in Bangladesh increased from $52 million to US$121 million, an increase which Rahman said was the greatest in South Asia. In 2004, the United Nations reported that foreign investment in Bangladesh had reached a record US$460 million.\n\nPolitical unrest arose in 2004. On 21 August, grenade attacks at an opposition Awami League rally killed 20 and injured around 300 others. General strikes against Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's government were held regularly throughout the end of the year. Rahman criticized both sides, saying that such political violence and unrest threatened much-needed foreign investment, and the government had to provide security. He offered his resignation in December 2004, reportedly over a dispute with officials in the Prime Minister's Office, but Zia declined to accept it. Rahman continued in the post for the remainder of his \"two-year contractual obligation.\"\n\nRahman's goal was to attract US$1 billion in investment to Bangladesh while in office. He said that Bangladesh's infrastructure needed improvement. The government encouraged foreign investment in infrastructure through a \"build-own-transfer\" model. In May 2005, Rahman announced a deal with the US company Vulcan Inc. to invest $1.6 billion in new power and fertiliser plants, projected to increase Bangladesh's energy capacity by nearly 50 percent.\n\nIn August 2005, Rahman sued five members of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, a private think tank, for defamation after they criticised his investment policy. He said they had made \"disgraceful, false and fabricated statements\". The \"Hindustan Times\" said the suit and issuance of related arrest warrants, was an example of \"persecution of intellectuals critical of the government\" and the persons sued were renowned in their field.\n\nThe June 2005 explosion at Niko Resources' Tengratila Gas Field in Sunamganj District, was the second during the project to revive the Chattack field. Against accusations that Niko had bribed Energy Adviser Mosharraf Hossain, he resigned.\n\nRahman was named to succeed him. In August 2005, he announced completion of a deal with the British oil company Cairn Energy to explore oil and gas deposits offshore Bangladesh.\n\nThe following month, Rahman participated in talks for a transborder natural gas pipeline from Burma's Arakan State to India, to pass through Bangladesh. The deal was shelved in early October 2005 after Bangladesh asked for additional trade concessions, and Burma and India chose to develop a direct route between them. In 2006, Rahman accused Burma and India of having encroached on thousands of square miles of Bangladeshi territorial waters for natural gas exploration.\n\nRahman was involved in talks between the government and India's Tata Group in early 2006 over a $300 million proposal to build steel and fertiliser factories, as well as a power plant. After the talks were unsuccessful, Rahman opened talks with Pakistan's Dawood Group in August 2006 on a more modest $30 million deal.\n\nIn September 2005, Rahman announced a 16 percent increase in petrol prices to aid the government-owned Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation, due to the price increases for crude oil on world markets. The price hikes sparked protests in Dhaka, and the government adopted a five-day workweek to conserve energy. It expected that the private sector would follow the government example. In June 2006, Rahman announced an additional one-third increase in petrol prices, as well as a 10 percent increase in diesel and kerosene prices, one of the largest fuel-price hikes in Bangladesh's history.\n\nIn late August 2006, protesters demanded Rahman's resignation as energy adviser and burned him in effigy in response to plans by the British corporation Asia Energy (now Global Coal, GCM Resources) to develop an open-pit coal mine in Phulbari, Dinajpur district. Activists said that the mine would cause environmental damage, threaten water supply, and displace up to 120,000 residents of the area, including the Shantal indigenous peoples. On the first day of protests, police killed six persons and 300 were injured in a massive protest of 30,000 people outside the local Asia Energy offices. The protests spread and the next day, twenty people were injured. Students at Dhaka University joined the effort. An estimated 70,000 people in total joined the protests across the country. As of December 2010, the mine was still being protested and the government had not awarded a contract for its development.\n\nIn 2006 Rahman urged calm, saying, \"This incident has sent the wrong message to foreign investors, which we cannot afford at all when we are struggling hard to woo more and more investment.\"\n\nKhaleda Zia's government ended in October 2006 and, under the constitution, elections are supposed to take place within three months, or January 2007. That fall there was a fierce struggle among the numerous parties, 14 of which were part of an Awami League-alliance and several were allied with the BNP. The caretaker government was trying to bring all parties to the table to settle election questions amidst rising tensions and violence. \"Arab News\" noted when reporting the late November 2006 incident below, that \"At least 40 people were killed and hundreds injured in clashes between rival parties since late October.\"\n\nAs an ex-energy adviser, Rahman kept in touch with colleagues from the BNP in the government. On 24 November 2006, journalists and TV news reporters took photos of 44 BNP administration officials, some retired like Rahman and others incumbents, leaving Rahman's office after a midnight meeting; many tried to hide their faces. A spokesman from the Awami League said that the men were meeting to try to \"rig\" the scheduled January 2007 election for BNP and its allies. Rahman denied the charge, saying he was holding a \"private party\" for friends to see his new office. The Awami League (and allies) called for a boycott of the scheduled January 2007 elections, demanding electoral reform.\n\nIn January 2007, the military led by General Moeen took over the caretaker government, and imposed a state of emergency. According to the then Presidential Adviser and Minister Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury, Army Chief, Lt. Gen. Moeen was the main force in the military intervention and declaration by President Iajuddin Ahmed of a state of emergency on 11 January 2007. ref></ref> Moeen and his associates selected that illegal government's Chief Advisor Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed. Prof. Dr. Iauddin Ahmed continued as President. In March 2007, the caretaker government charged Khaleda Zia's two sons with corruption. In April, it announced a ban on politicians visiting the former prime minister, under the conditions of the emergency. The CTG also charged some of Zia's ministers with corruption. Also in April 2007, the CTG sued Sheikh Hasina, leader of the Awami League, for graft.\n\nOn 31 March 2007, the Establishment Ministry (under the caretaker government) announced that it had completed a three-person inquiry into the actions of some of the senior officials at the November 2006 meeting with ex-energy advisor Rahman. As a result, it reassigned 13 men out of office to positions as \"officers on special duty\" (OSD). Three of the men were \"joint secretaries, four deputy secretaries and six senior assistant secretaries.\"\n\nThe CTG in late 2008 began to prepare for an election that year. In October 2008, shortly before the December election, Rahman filed a complaint with the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), against its chair General Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury. Rahman accused the BNP appointee of having misappropriated 224.1 million taka in a money-laundering scheme. After an investigation, on 19 March 2009, an ACC internal committee dismissed the complaint as \"baseless and unmotivated\". It noted that Rahman had failed to appear personally before the committee to provide evidence.\n\nThe election was held on 29 December 2008. The Awami League and its Grand Alliance came to power with two-thirds of the seats in Parliament. In 2010, the Awami League government charged the 13 bureaucrats of what had become known as the \"Uttara Conspiracy\" with sedition. They received bail. At that time, eleven were still serving in the government and two had retired.\n\nIn 2008, Mahmudur Rahman bought the ownership of the Bengali-language, daily newspaper \"Amar Desh,\" and was appointed acting editor. He has made it a leading opposition paper.\n\nOn 28 December 2008, the day before national elections, an Awami League committee chairman accused Rahman of collaborating to print fake ballot papers with his presses in order for BNP supporters to rig the election. The Awami League-coalition won the 2008 election by an overwhelming margin, winning two-thirds of the seats in Parliament. It had promised to set up an International Crimes Tribunal to prosecute war crimes during the Bangladesh Liberation War.\n\nOn 2 October 2009, \"Amar Desh\" reported that the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission had hired Indian employees, and that their presence threatened state security. The BTRC sued the paper for defamation on 28 October, noting that the Indian nationals had been appointed by the United Nations, rather than the commission.\n\nIn January 2010, the energy minister, Tawfik-e-Elahi Chowdhury, sued \"Amar Desh\" for defamation over a December 2009 article alleging that he and Sajeeb Wazed Joy Hasina, the son of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, had received bribes from Chevron Corporation to secure contracts in Bangladesh. Three days after the story was published, the reporter was physically attacked by unknown persons. Also in response to the article on Hasina and Chowdhury, Awami League members had already filed 24 defamation charges against \"Amar Desh\" before the energy minister did.\n\nReporters Without Borders reported that on 1 June 2010, the government sent more than 100 police to arrest Rahman and close down the paper's printing press. National media also carried news of the paper's shutdown and editors' arrest. According to Reporters without Borders, Mohammad Hasmat Ali, publisher of \"Amar Desh\", the previous day had been taken by the National Security Intelligence (NSI), interrogated, and forced to sign two blank pieces of paper. NSI agents later filled these in with the following statements:\n\nSeveral days later, the leaders of around 25 newspapers in Bangladesh signed a letter which demanded that the ban on \"Amar Desh\" publication be rescinded. Different government entities filed a total of four charges against Rahman: two by police for an altercation that arose when they shut down the printing press and newspaper offices; one for sedition for allegedly publishing posters and publicity material for Hizb-ut-Tahrir, a banned Islamist group; and one for fraud based on his publisher's signed statement. Rahman was remanded into custody for eight days. On 12 June, the High Court stayed the ban on \"Amar Desh\" operations, allowing it to resume publication. On 17 June 2010, Rahman's attorneys released his statement asserting torture during police custody. Rahman was released on bail in mid-July.\n\nOn 12 October 2010, the government deferred the sedition case. Rahman was acquitted of the other charges, a verdict upheld by the Appeals Court.\n\nIn August 2010, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh sentenced Rahman to six months for contempt of court for a 21 April 2010 \"Amar Desh\" article, which said the top court was pro-government. Rahman is the only person ever sentenced for contempt by the Bangladesh Supreme Court. The Supreme Court had a separate, pending charge for contempt for a 10 May article but withdrew it.\n\nInternational human rights groups described the government's cases against \"Amar Desh\" as \"legal harassment\". Reporters Without Borders released a statement saying,\n\nOn 17 March 2011, Mahmudur Rahman was freed from prison. Many national figures arrived to welcome his release, including the film maker Chashi Nazrul Islam, writer Farhad Mazhar, journalist Abdul Hye Shikdar, and former Inspector-General of Police M.A. Quayum.\n\nIn fulfilment of its campaign promises, the Awami government initiated a Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal to bring justice related to war crimes committed during the Bangladesh liberation war in 1971.\n\nLess than a month after Rahman's release, on 28 March 2011 a judge issued an arrest order for him and two other journalists for defamation charges related to an April 2010 article reporting that certain Awami Party leaders of Kotalipara and their relatives were on the war crimes suspects' list of the International Crimes Tribunal. The judge issued the arrest order for the three journalists because they failed to appear in court; but they had notified him of an earlier case requiring them to be in a Dhaka court the same day. Journalist organisations criticized the arrest order, saying a person could not appear before two courts the same day. They said that the government was disregarding the 2 February 2011 legislation passed by Parliament, which had \"nullified the provision of issuing arrest warrants against newsmen in defamation cases.\" By this time, Mahmudur Rahman had been subject to 49 legal cases under the Awami government, most for defamation.\n\nOn 14 December 2012, the government charged Rahman with sedition for publishing Skype conversations, illegally hacked by other parties, between Justice Mohammed Nizamul Huq, chairman of Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal, and Ahmed Ziauddin, an international criminal law expert and war crimes activist based in Brussels. The discussions had to do with the work of the Tribunal, and the material was published also in \"The Economist\" and another Bangladesh media outlet. Huq resigned shortly afterward because of the controversy. After charges were filed, Rahman avoided arrest by spending the next months in his newspaper's offices, leaving only to seek anticipatory bail.\n\nIn protesting the charges, Amnesty International said, \"The government of Bangladesh must ensure that everyone, in particular journalists and editors, are free to express their views and opinion peacefully without being harassed, intimidated, detained or tortured.\"\n\nThe prosecutions and convictions by the International Tribunal have resulted in rising political tensions among some interests. Jamaat-e-Islami, the largest Islamist party, led a one-day strike that developed into violent riots when one of its top officials was convicted. The 2013 Shahbag protests, supported by many students and younger people, began 5 February 2013 in Dhaka after one of the men convicted of war crimes was sentenced to life imprisonment rather than death, as two others were. Protesters demanded that persons convicted of war crimes be sentenced to death, and Jamaat-e-Islami be banned from politics because of the violence of its followers. On 24 February, protest leaders called for the arrest of Mahmudur Rahman, accusing him of inciting communal violence and sedition because of \"Amar Desh\" coverage of bloggers and activists. Demonstrators said Rahman had reported \"fabricated\" news.\n\nOn 26 February, Home Minister Muhiuddin Khan Alamgir met with protesters and pledged to take measures against Rahman. In response, the editor has called the Shahbag movement \"nothing but fascism\". In a 2013 interview earlier in February with \"Prime News\", Rahman had said,\n\nIslam-affiliated parties held large demonstrations on 6 April 2013, with protesters demanding a new blasphemy law with a penalty of death. The Prime Minister said she did not support such legislation.\n\nNoting that blasphemy laws covered \"hurting religious sentiment,\" the government charged four bloggers of eleven it identified as posting anti-Muslim material. It said the law could be applied to \"Amar Desh\" and \"Daily Sangram\" for inaccurate December 2012 articles purportedly representing imams in Saudi Arabia. In late February 2013, the bloggers and \"Amar Desh\" attacked each other in print and online. Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists have criticised both the legal harassment of Rahman and the arrest of bloggers as hampering freedom of the press in Bangladesh.\n\nOn 11 April 2013, Bangladesh Police finally arrested Rahman on charges of sedition related to the hacked Huq-Ziauddin conversations, other cyber-crimes, and inciting violence. They seized his electronics and storage devices. The court granted 13 days of remand for sedition and the other charges. The confirmed charges are as follows:\n\nThat evening, the police closed down the \"Amar Desh\". Although the newspaper had been sealed, its declaration had not been suspended; the \"Amar Desh\" was distributed in limited editions for the next three days in Dhaka using another press. Police raided the \"Daily Sangram\" and found evidence that it was printing \"Amar Desh\". The government sued \"Sangram\"'s publisher and editor, Abul Asad, and arrested 19 printers. It also filed charges against Mahmuda Begum, Rahman's mother, who had become the acting head of the newspaper in the absence of the editor. Syed Abdal Ahmed, an attorney and executive editor of the \"Amar Desh,\" said the Supreme Court's order from 2010 (?) was still in effect and prohibited the government from stopping the paper's publication. Information Minister Hasanul Haq Inu said \"Amar Desh\" could resume printing from another site once it had an order from Dhaka's magistrate.\n\nFarhad Mazhar, a journalist and family friend, had seen marks on Rahman's body that appeared to be signs of torture while in police confinement. Rahman's wife filed a petition asserting the police had tortured Mahmudur Rahman during the seven-day remand period related to sedition charges. The Supreme Court indicated it would respond to the writ on 21 April 2013. During his detention, Rahman started a hunger strike on 15 April to demand continued publication of the paper and the dropping of charges against his mother and the 19 printers. In total, Rahman spent 13 days on remand.\n\nOn 12 June, Mahmudur Rahman was remanded again for a further 3 days for the disturbances at 22 February protests that were alleged to be stirred up by \"Amar Desh\" reports.\n\nOn 3 December, a court placed Rahman on a further six-day remand followed by confinement in jail.\n\nInternational human rights groups criticised the government's actions and called for the release of Rahman and the four bloggers. Protesting were Human Rights Watch, the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organization Against Torture (OMCT), which also asked the government to guarantee Rahman's security from torture; and the Asian Human Rights Commission.\nIn addition, press organisations supported release of the publisher and bloggers, and urged the government to protect freedom of the press. They included International Federation of Journalists and the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\nBangladesh politicians and activists generally responded in terms of their affiliations. Concerns expressed included that the government was increasing tensions, and opposition leaders urged freedom of the press. Representatives of the Awami League and those who opposed Rahman repeated accusations against him. Nurul Kabir, editor of the competing daily, \"New Age,\" said, \"I have serious disagreement with the editorial policy of Mahmudur Rahman and the most of the contents that his paper \"Amar Desh\" disseminates, but I have no doubt that the government has arrested him primarily because of his active support for the opposition political camps. In a democratic dispensation, this is unacceptable.\"\n\nAfter a Dhaka court accepted charges against 41 opposition politicians related to protests, BNP committee member MK Anwar spoke before a rally at the National Press Club. He said, \"There's no peace in people's minds. Opposition leaders and workers are subjected to extreme torture. Now they (the Awami League government) have launched coercive acts against mass media. This government can't tolerate its opponents' views. They've closed down 'Amar Desh' printing press after arresting its acting editor Mahmudur Rahman.\" On the other hand, a leader of the Shahbag protests repeated accusations of Rahman's misinformation.\n\nAfter more than a month of confinement, 15 editors signed a joint statement that demanded the release of Rahman, dismissal of cases against Rahman's mother and \"Daily Sangram\" for printing \"Amar Desh\" after Rahman's arrest, and an end to the ban on \"Amar Desh's\" publication, as well as similar bans from 5 May on broadcasters Diganta and Islamic TV.\n\n\n"}

Common names include bulletwood, balatá, ausubo, massaranduba, and (ambiguously) \"cow-tree\".\n\nBalatá is a large tree, growing to tall. The leaves are alternate, elliptical, entire, and long. The flowers are white, and are produced at the beginning of the rainy season. The fruit is a yellow berry, in diameter, which is edible; it contains one (occasionally two) seed(s). Its latex is used industrially for products such as chicle.\n\nThe latex is extracted in the same manner in which sap is extracted from the rubber tree. It is then dried to form an inelastic rubber-like material. It is almost identical to gutta-percha (produced from a closely related southeast Asian tree), and is sometimes called \"gutta-balatá\".\n\nBalatá was often used in the production of high-quality golf balls, to use as the outer layer of the ball. Balatá-covered balls have a high spin rate, but do not travel as far as most balls with a Surlyn cover. Due to the nondurable nature of the material the golf club strikes, balatá-covered balls do not last long before needing to be replaced. While once favored by professional and low-handicap players, they are now obsolete, replaced by newer Surlyn and urethane technology.\n\nToday, Brazil is the largest producer of Massaranduba wood, where it is cut in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe tree is a hardwood with a red heart, which is used for furniture and as a construction material where it grows. Locals often refer to it as bulletwood for its extremely hard wood, which is so dense that it does not float in water. Drilling is necessary to drive nailed connections. In trade, it is occasionally (and incorrectly) called \"brazilwood\".\n\nThe fruit, like that of the related sapodilla (\"M. zapota\"), is edible.\n\nThough its heartwood may present in a shade of purple, \"Manilkara bidentata\" should not be confused with another tropical tree widely known as \"purpleheart\", \"Peltogyne pubescens\".\n\nThis timber is being used to produce outdoor furniture and is being marketed as \"Pacific Jarrah\" in Australia.\n"}
{"id": "2428476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2428476", "title": "Mass balance", "text": "Mass balance\n\nA mass balance, also called a material balance, is an application of conservation of mass to the analysis of physical systems. By accounting for material entering and leaving a system, mass flows can be identified which might have been unknown, or difficult to measure without this technique. The exact conservation law used in the analysis of the system depends on the context of the problem, but all revolve around mass conservation, i.e. that matter cannot disappear or be created spontaneously.\n\nTherefore, mass balances are used widely in engineering and environmental analyses. For example, mass balance theory is used to design chemical reactors, to analyse alternative processes to produce chemicals, as well as to model pollution dispersion and other processes of physical systems. Closely related and complementary analysis techniques include the population balance, energy balance and the somewhat more complex entropy balance. These techniques are required for thorough design and analysis of systems such as the refrigeration cycle.\n\nIn environmental monitoring the term budget calculations is used to describe mass balance equations where they are used to evaluate the monitoring data (comparing input and output, etc.) In biology the dynamic energy budget theory for metabolic organisation makes explicit use of mass and energy balance.\n\nThe general form quoted for a mass balance is \"The mass that enters a system must, by conservation of mass, either leave the system or accumulate within the system \".\n\nMathematically the mass balance for a system without a chemical reaction is as follows:\n\nStrictly speaking the above equation holds also for systems with chemical reactions if the terms in the balance equation are taken to refer to total mass, i.e. the sum of all the chemical species of the system. In the absence of a chemical reaction the amount of any chemical species flowing in and out will be the same; this gives rise to an equation for each species present in the system. However, if this is not the case then the mass balance equation must be amended to allow for the generation or depletion (consumption) of each chemical species. Some use one term in this equation to account for chemical reactions, which will be negative for depletion and positive for generation. However, the conventional form of this equation is written to account for both a positive generation term (i.e. product of reaction) and a negative consumption term (the reactants used to produce the products). Although overall one term will account for the total balance on the system, if this balance equation is to be applied to an individual species and then the entire process, both terms are necessary. This modified equation can be used not only for reactive systems, but for population balances such as arise in particle mechanics problems. The equation is given below; note that it simplifies to the earlier equation in the case that the generation term is zero.\n\n\nA simple example can illustrate the concept. Consider the situation in which a slurry is flowing into a settling tank to remove the solids in the tank. Solids are collected at the bottom by means of a conveyor belt partially submerged in the tank, and water exits via an overflow outlet.\n\nIn this example, there are two substances: solids and water. The water overflow outlet carries an increased concentration of water relative to solids, as compared to the slurry inlet, and the exit of the conveyor belt carries an increased concentration of solids relative to water.\n\nAssumptions\n\nAnalysis\n\nSuppose that the slurry inlet composition (by mass) is 50% solid and 50% water, with a mass flow of . The tank is assumed to be operating at steady state, and as such accumulation is zero, so input and output must be equal for both the solids and water. If we know that the removal efficiency for the slurry tank is 60%, then the water outlet will contain of solids (40% times times 50% solids). If we measure the flow rate of the combined solids and water, and the water outlet is shown to be , then the amount of water exiting via the conveyor belt must be . This allows us to completely determine how the mass has been distributed in the system with only limited information and using the mass balance relations across the system boundaries.\n\nMass balances can be performed across systems which have cyclic flows. In these systems output streams are fed back into the input of a unit, often for further reprocessing.\n\nSuch systems are common in grinding circuits, where grain is crushed then sieved to only allow fine particles out of the circuit and the larger particles are returned to the roller mill (grinder). However, recycle flows are by no means restricted to solid mechanics operations; they are used in liquid and gas flows, as well. One such example is in cooling towers, where water is pumped through a tower many times, with only a small quantity of water drawn off at each pass (to prevent solids build up) until it has either evaporated or exited with the drawn off water.\nThe use of the recycle aids in increasing overall conversion of input products, which is useful for low per-pass conversion processes (such as the Haber process).\n\nA mass balance can also be taken differentially. The concept is the same as for a large mass balance, but it is performed in the context of a limiting system (for example, one can consider the limiting case in time or, more commonly, volume). A differential mass balance is used to generate differential equations that can provide an effective tool for modelling and understanding the target system.\n\nThe differential mass balance is usually solved in two steps: first, a set of governing differential equations must be obtained, and then these equations must be solved, either analytically or, for less tractable problems, numerically.\n\nThe following systems are good examples of the applications of the differential mass balance:\n\n\nThe ideal completely mixed batch reactor is a closed system. Isothermal conditions are assumed, and mixing prevents concentration gradients as reactant concentrations decrease and product concentrations increase over time. Many chemistry textbooks implicitly assume that the studied system can be described as a batch reactor when they write about reaction kinetics and chemical equilibrium.\nThe mass balance for a substance A becomes\n \nwhere \"r\" denotes the rate at which substance A is produced, V is the volume (which may be constant or not), \"n\" the number of moles (\"n\") of substance A.\n\nIn a fed-batch reactor some reactants/ingredients are added continuously or in pulses (compare making porridge by either first blending all ingredients and then letting it boil, which can be described as a batch reactor, or by first mixing only water and salt and making that boil before the other ingredients are added, which can be described as a fed-batch reactor). Mass balances for fed-batch reactors become a bit more complicated.\n\nIn the first example, we will show how to use a mass balance to derive a relationship between the percent excess air for the combustion of a hydrocarbon-base fuel oil and the percent oxygen in the combustion product gas. First, normal dry air contains of oxygen per mole of air, so there is one mole of in of dry air. For stoichiometric combustion, the relationships between the mass of air and the mass of each combustible element in a fuel oil are:\n \n\nConsidering the accuracy of typical analytical procedures, an equation for the mass of air per mass of fuel at stoichiometric combustion is:\n\nwhere wC, wH, wS, and wO refer to the mass fraction of each element in the fuel oil, sulfur burning to SO2, and AFR refers to the air-fuel ratio in mass units.\n\nFor of fuel oil containing 86.1% C, 13.6% H, 0.2% O, and 0.1% S the stoichiometric mass of air is , so AFR = 14.56. The combustion product mass is then . At exact stoichiometry, should be absent. At 15 percent excess air, the AFR = 16.75, and the mass of the combustion product gas is , which contains of excess oxygen. The combustion gas thus contains 2.84 percent by mass. The relationships between percent excess air and % in the combustion gas are accurately expressed by quadratic equations, valid over the range 0–30 percent excess air:\n \nIn the second example we will use the law of mass action to derive the expression for a chemical equilibrium constant.\n\nAssume we have a closed reactor in which the following liquid phase reversible reaction occurs:\n\nThe mass balance for substance A becomes\n \nAs we have a liquid phase reaction we can (usually) assume a constant volume and since formula_1 we get\n\nor\n\nIn many text books this is given as the definition of reaction rate without specifying the implicit assumption that we are talking about reaction rate in a closed system with only one reaction. This is an unfortunate mistake that has confused many students over the years.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action the forward reaction rate can be written as\n\nand the backward reaction rate as\n\nThe rate at which substance A is produced is thus\n\nand since, at equilibrium, the concentration of A is constant we get\n\nor, rearranged\n\nThe continuously mixed tank reactor is an open system with an influent stream of reactants and an effluent stream of products. A lake can be regarded as a tank reactor, and lakes with long turnover times (e.g. with low flux-to-volume ratios) can for many purposes be regarded as continuously stirred (e.g. homogeneous in all respects). The mass balance then becomes\n \nwhere \"Q\" and Q denote the volumetric flow in and out of the system respectively and \"C\" and \"C\" the concentration of A in the inflow and outflow respective. In an open system we can never reach a chemical equilibrium. We can, however, reach a steady state where all state variables (temperature, concentrations etc.) remain constant (formula_2).\n\nConsider a bathtub in which there is some bathing salt dissolved. We now fill in more water, keeping the bottom plug in. What happens?\n\nSince there is no reaction, formula_3 and since there is no outflow formula_4. The mass balance becomes\n \nor\n\nUsing a mass balance for total volume, however, it is evident that formula_5and that formula_6. Thus we get\n\nNote that there is no reaction and hence no reaction rate or rate law involved, and yet formula_7. We can thus draw the conclusion that reaction rate can not be defined in a general manner using formula_8. One must first write down a mass balance before a link between formula_8 and the reaction rate can be found. Many textbooks, however, define reaction rate as\n\nwithout mentioning that this definition implicitly assumes that the system is closed, has a constant volume and that there is only one reaction.\n\nThe idealized plug flow reactor is an open system resembling a tube with no mixing in the direction of flow but perfect mixing perpendicular to the direction of flow. Often used for systems like rivers and water pipes if the flow is turbulent. When a mass balance is made for a tube, one first considers an infinitesimal part of the tube and make a mass balance over that using the ideal tank reactor model. That mass balance is then integrated over the entire reactor volume to obtain:\n\nIn numeric solutions, e.g. when using computers, the ideal tube is often translated to a series of tank reactors, as it can be shown that a PFR is equivalent to an infinite number of stirred tanks in series, but the latter is often easier to analyze, especially at steady state.\n\nIn reality, reactors are often non-ideal, in which combinations of the reactor models above are used to describe the system. Not only chemical reaction rates, but also mass transfer rates may be important in the mathematical description of a system, especially in heterogeneous systems.\n\nAs the chemical reaction rate depends on temperature it is often necessary to make both an energy balance (often a heat balance rather than a full-fledged energy balance) as well as mass balances to fully describe the system. A different reactor model might be needed for the energy balance: A system that is closed with respect to mass might be open with respect to energy e.g. since heat may enter the system through conduction.\n\nIn industrial process plants, using the fact that the mass entering and leaving any portion of a process plant must balance, data validation and reconciliation algorithms may be employed to correct measured flows, provided that enough redundancy of flow measurements exist to permit statistical reconciliation and exclusion of detectably erroneous measurements. Since all real world measured values contain inherent error, the reconciled measurements provide a better basis than the measured values do for financial reporting, optimization, and regulatory reporting. Software packages exist to make this commercially feasible on a daily basis.\n\n"}
{"id": "3219945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3219945", "title": "Metabolic rift", "text": "Metabolic rift\n\nMetabolic rift is Karl Marx's notion of the \"irreparable rift in the interdependent process of social metabolism,\"—Marx's key conception of ecological crisis tendencies under capitalism. Marx theorized a rupture in the metabolic interaction between humanity and the rest of nature emanating from capitalist production and the growing division between town and country.\n\nMetabolic rift, according to John Bellamy Foster who coined the term, is the development of Marx's earlier work in the \"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts\" on species-being and the relationship between humans and nature. Metabolism is Marx's \"mature analysis of the alienation of nature,\" and presents \"a more solid—and scientific—way in which to depict the complex, dynamic interchange between human beings and nature, resulting from human labor.\"\n\nAs opposed to those who have attributed to Marx a disregard for nature and responsibility for the environmental problems of the Soviet Union and other purportedly communist states, Foster sees in the theory of metabolic rift evidence of Marx's ecological perspective. The theory of metabolic rift \"enable[ed] [Marx] to develop a critique of environmental degradation that anticipated much of present-day ecological thought,\" including questions of sustainability.\n\nMarx's writings on metabolism were developed during England's \"second\" agricultural revolution (1815–1880), a period which was characterized by the development of soil chemistry and the growth of the use of chemical fertilizer. The depletion of soil fertility, or \"soil exhaustion,\" had become a key concern for capitalist society, and demand for fertilizer was such that Britain and other powers initiated explicit policies for the importation of bone and guano, including raiding of Napoleonic battlefields and catacombs, British monopolization of Peruvian guano supplies, and, in the United States, \"the imperial annexation of any islands thought to be rich in [guano]\" through the Guano Islands Act (1856).\n\nMarx's theory drew heavily on contemporary advances in agricultural chemistry unknown to earlier classical economists such as Ricardo and Malthus. For them, different levels of soil fertility (and thus rent) was attributed \"almost entirely to the natural or absolute productivity of the soil,\" with improvement (or degradation) playing only a minor role.\n\nGerman agricultural chemist Justus von Liebig, in his \"Organic Chemistry in Its Applications to Agriculture and Physiology\" (1840), presented the first convincing explanation of the role of soil nutrients in the growth of plants. In 1842, Liebig expanded the use of the term metabolism (\"Stoffwechsel\"), from referring to material exchanges in the body, up to the biochemical processes of natural systems.\n\nFoster argues that Liebig's work became more critical of capitalist agriculture as time went on. From the standpoint of nutrient cycling, the socio-economic relationship between rural and urban areas was self-evidently contradictory, hindering the possibility of sustainability:\nIf it were practicable to collect, with the least loss, all the solid and fluid excrements of the inhabitants of the town, and return to each farmer the portion arising from produce originally supplied by him to the town, the productiveness of the land might be maintained almost unimpaired for ages to come, and the existing store of mineral elements in every fertile field would be amply sufficient for the wants of increasing populations.\n\nMarx rooted his theory of social-ecological metabolism in Liebig's analysis but connected it to his understanding of the labor process. Marx understood that, throughout history, it was through labor that humans appropriated nature to satisfy their needs. Thus the metabolism, or interaction, of society with nature is \"a universal and perpetual condition.\"\n\nIn \"Capital\", Marx integrated his materialist conception of nature with his materialist conception of history. Fertility, Marx argued, was not a natural quality of the soil, but was rather bound up with the social relations of the time. By conceptualizing the complex, interdependent processes of material exchange and regulatory actions that link human society with non-human nature as \"metabolic relations,\" Marx allowed these processes to be both \"nature-imposed conditions\" and subject to human agency, a dynamic largely missed, according to Foster, by the reduction of ecological questions to issues of value.\n\nThe central contribution of the metabolic rift perspective is to locate socio-ecological contradictions internal to the development of capitalism. Later socialists expanded upon Marx's ideas, including Nikolai Bukharin in \"Historical Materialism\" (1921) and Karl Kautsky in \"The Agrarian Question\" (1899), which developed questions of the exploitation of the countryside by the town and the \"fertilizer treadmill\" that resulted from metabolic rift.\n\nContemporary eco-socialist theorists aside from Foster have also explored these directions, including James O'Connor, who sees capitalist undervaluing of nature as leading to economic crisis, what he refers to as \nthe second contradiction of capitalism.\n\nScholars from a variety of disciplines have drawn on Marx's metabolic approach and the concept of metabolic rift in analyzing the relation of society to the rest of nature. With increasing amounts of carbon dioxide being released into the environment from capitalist production, the theory of a carbon rift has also immerged.\n\nThe metabolic rift is characterized in different ways by historical materialists. For Jason W. Moore, the distinction between social and natural systems is empirically false and theoretically arbitrary; following a different reading of Marx, Moore views metabolisms as relations of human and extra-human natures. In this view, capitalism's metabolic rift unfolds through the town-country division of labor, itself a \"bundle\" of relations between humans and the rest of nature. Moore sees it as constitutive of the endless accumulation of capital. Moore's perspective, although also rooted in historical materialism, produces a widely divergent view from that of Foster and others about what makes ecological crisis and how it relates to capital accumulation.\n\nNine months after Foster's groundbreaking article appeared, Moore argued that the origins of the metabolic rift were not found in the 19th century but in the rise of capitalism during the \"long\" 16th century. The metabolic rift was not a consequence of industrial agriculture but capitalist relations pivoting on the law of value. Moore consequently focuses attention on the grand movements of primitive accumulation, colonialism, and the globalization of town-country relations that characterized early modern capitalism. There were, in this view, not one but many metabolic rifts; every great phase of capitalist development organized nature in new ways, each one with its own metabolic rift. In place of agricultural revolutions, Moore emphasizes recurrent agro-ecological revolutions, assigned the historical task of providing cheap food and cheap labor, in the history of capitalism, an interpretation that extends the analysis to the food crises of the early 21st century.\n\nUp until the 16th or 17th centuries, cities' metabolic dependency upon surrounding countryside (for resources, etc.), coupled with the technological limitations to production and extraction, prevented extensive urbanization. Early urban centers were bioregionally defined, and had relatively light \"footprints,\" recycling city nightsoils back into the surrounding areas.\n\nHowever, with the rise of capitalism, cities expanded in size and population. Large-scale industry required factories, raw material, workers, and large amounts of food. As urban economic security was dependent upon its metabolic support system, cities now looked further afield for their resource and waste flows. As spatial barriers were broken down, capitalist society \"violated\" what were previously \"nature-imposed conditions of sustainability.\"\n\nWith trade and expansion, food and fiber were shipped longer distances. The nutrients of the soil were sent to cities in the form of agricultural produce, but these same nutrients, in the form of human and animal waste, were not returned to the land. Thus there was a one-way movement, a \"robbing of the soil\" in order to maintain the socio-economic reproduction of society.\n\nMarx thus linked the crisis of pollution in cities with the crisis of soil depletion. The rift was a result of the antagonistic separation of town and country, and the social-ecological relations of production created by capitalism were ultimately unsustainable. From \"Capital\", volume 1, on \"Large-scale Industry and Agriculture\":\nCapitalist production collects the population together in great centres, and causes the urban population to achieve an ever-growing preponderance. This has two results. On the one hand it concentrates the historical motive force of society; on the other hand, \"it disturbs the metabolic interaction between man and the earth, i.e. it prevents the return to the soil of its constituent elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing; hence it hinders the operation of the eternal natural condition for the lasting fertility of the soil\"...But by destroying the circumstances surrounding that metabolism...it compels its systematic restoration as a regulative law of social production, and in a form adequate to the full development of the human race...All progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the worker, but of robbing the soil; all progress in increasing the fertility of the soil for a given time is a progress toward ruining the more long-lasting sources of that fertility...\"Capitalist production, therefore, only develops the techniques and the degree of combination of the social process of production by simultaneously undermining the original sources of all wealth—the soil and the worker\".\n\nThe concept of metabolic rift captures \"the material estrangement of human beings within capitalist society from the natural conditions which formed the basis for their existence.\" However, Marx also emphasizes the importance of historical change. It was both necessary and possible to rationally govern human metabolism with nature, but this was something \"completely beyond the capabilities of bourgeois society.\" In a future society of freely associated producers, however, humans could govern their relations with nature via collective control, rather than through the blind power of market relations. In \"Capital\", volume 3, Marx states:\nFreedom, in this sphere...can consist only in this, that socialized man, the associated producers, govern the human metabolism with nature in a rational way, bringing it under their own collective control rather than being dominated by it as a blind power; accomplishing it with the least expenditure of energy and in conditions most worthy and appropriate for their human nature.\nBut Marx did not argue that a sustainable relation to the earth was an automatic result of the transition to socialism. Rather, there was a need for planning and measures to address the division of labor and population between town and country and for the restoration and improvement of the soil.\n\nDespite Marx's assertion that a concept of ecological sustainability was \"of very limited practical relevance to capitalist society,\" as it was incapable of applying rational scientific methods and social planning due to the pressures of competition, the theory of metabolic rift may be seen as relevant to, if not explicitly invoked in, many contemporary debates and policy directions of environmental governance.\n\nThere is a rapidly growing body of literature on social-ecological metabolism. While originally limited to questions of soil fertility—essentially a critique of capitalist agriculture—the concept of metabolic rift has since been taken up in numerous fields and its scope expanded. For example, Clausen and Clark (2005) have extended the use of metabolic rift to marine ecology, while Moore (2000) uses the concept to discuss the broader concerns of global environmental crises and the viability of capitalism itself. Fischer-Kowalski (1998) discusses the application of \"the biological concept of metabolism to social systems,\" tracing it through several contributing scientific traditions, including biology, ecology, social theory, cultural anthropology, and social geography. A social metabolism approach has become \"one of the most important paradigms for the empirical analysis of the society-nature-interaction across various disciplines,\" particularly in the fields of industrial metabolism and material flow analysis.\n\nDavid Harvey points out that much of the environmental movement has held (and in some areas continues to hold) a profound anti-urban sentiment, seeing cities as \"the highpoint of plundering and pollution of all that is good and holy on planet earth.\" The problem is that such a perspective focuses solely on a particular form of nature, ignoring many people's lived experience of the environment and the importance of cities in ecological processes and as ecological sites in their own right.\n\nIn contrast, Erik Swyngedouw and other theorists have conceptualized the city as an ecological space through urban political ecology, which connects material flows within cities and between the urban and non-urban.\n\nIn city planning policy circles, there has been a recent movement toward urban sustainability. Hodson and Marvin discuss a \"new eco-urbanism\" that seeks to integrate environment and infrastructure, \"bundling\" architecture, ecology and technology in order to \"internalize\" energy, water, food, waste and other material flows. Unlike previous efforts to integrate nature into the city, which, according to Harvey, were primarily aesthetic and bourgeois in nature, these new efforts are taking place in the context of climate change, resource constraints and the threat of environmental crises.\n\nIn contrast to the traditional approach of capitalist urbanization, which sought more and more distant sources for material resources and waste sinks (as seen in the history of Los Angeles water), eco-urban sites would re-internalize their own resources and re-circulate wastes. The goal is autarky and greater ecological and infrastructural self-reliance through \"closed-loop systems\" that reduce reliance on external networks. Although difficult given the reliance on international supply chains, urban food movements are working to reduce the commodification of food and individual and social forms of alienation from food within cities. This takes place within actually existing conditions of neoliberalization, suggesting that healing metabolic rifts will be a process that requires both social and ecological transformations. \n\nHowever, critics link these efforts to \"managerial environmentalism,\" and worry that eco-urbanism too closely falls into an \"urban ecological security\" approach, echoing Mike Davis' analysis of securitization and fortress urbanism. A Marxist critique might also question the feasibility of sustainable cities within the context of a global capitalist system.\n\n\n"}

In 2002 he set a Guinness world record with a jump off a Lincoln Town Car stretch limo. According to the Associated Press, Hughes built his first manned rocket on January 30, 2014, and flew in just over one minute over Winkelman, Arizona. According to the CBC, Hughes collapsed after the landing and it took Hughes three days to recover. Hughes stated that the injuries suffered from the flight put him in a walker for two weeks. Hughes has stated he plans to run for governor of California.\n\nIn 2016 Hughes launched a failed fundraising attempt for a rocket that earned only $310. After professing his belief in a flat Earth later that year, Hughes gained support within the flat-Earth community. His post-flat-Earth fundraising campaign made its $7,875 goal. He has said he intends to make multiple rocket journeys, culminating in a flight to outer space, where he believes he will be able to take a picture of the entire Earth as a flat disk. He claimed in November 2017 that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had given him verbal permission more than a year ago to launch his rocket, pending approval from the Federal Aviation Administration; however, a BLM spokesman said its local field office had no record of speaking to Hughes at the time. According to the BLM, after seeing some news articles about the planned launch, a BLM representative reached out to Hughes with concerns. The rocket launch was originally scheduled for the weekend of November 25, 2017; Hughes then rescheduled for December 2, 2017, blaming ongoing difficulties in obtaining permissions. Hughes moved his launch pad so that he could take off and land on private property; however, the BLM maintained he still needed to fill out permits. Hughes defiantly stated the dispute would not stop him flying: \"I'm a daredevil. I'm not much for authority or rules.\"\n\nThe untested initial rocket was intended to reach a speed of ; further rocket trips, to be launched from a balloon up, are intended to reach above the atmosphere into outer space. Hughes acknowledged there are risks, telling the Associated Press: \"It's scary as hell. But none of us are getting out of this world alive.\" A fundraising campaign to cover the costs of the delay raised only around $100 of its $10,000 goal. On February 3, 2018, Hughes live-streamed another attempted to launch in front of spectators, but the rocket failed to ignite.\n\nA successful launch on March 24, 2018, resulted in his reaching a height of and a hard landing in the Mojave Desert. The steam-powered rocket launched at a sharp angle to avoid falling back to Earth on public land, and landed about away from the launch point. Hughes' team reported a maximum speed of 350 mph. Hughes reported no serious injury from the landing.\n\nIan Whittaker of Nottingham Trent University has commented that a more feasible way to view the shape of the Earth is to send up a camera in a high-altitude balloon; if high up enough in the atmosphere, such a camera can see the curvature of the Earth.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22058", "title": "Nymph", "text": "Nymph\n\nA nymph (, \"nýmphē\" ) in Greek mythology is a minor female nature deity typically associated with a particular location or landform.\n\nDifferent from other goddesses, nymphs are generally regarded as divine spirits who animate nature, and are usually depicted as beautiful, young nubile maidens who love to dance and sing; their amorous freedom sets them apart from the restricted and chaste wives and daughters of the Greek \"polis\". They are beloved by many and dwell in mountainous regions and forests by springs or rivers; as Walter Burkert (Burkert 1985:III.3.3) remarks, \"The idea that rivers are gods and springs divine nymphs is deeply rooted not only in poetry but in belief and ritual; the worship of these deities is limited only by the fact that they are inseparably identified with a specific locality.\"\nOther nymphs, always in the shape of young maidens, were part of the retinue of a god, such as Dionysus, Hermes, or Pan, or a goddess, generally the huntress Artemis. Nymphs were the frequent target of satyrs.\n\nThe Greek word has the primary meaning of \"nubile young woman; bride, young wife\" and is not associated with deities in particular. It refers to young women at the peak of sexual attractiveness, contrasting with \"parthenos\" () \"a virgin (of any age)\", and generic \"kore\" ( < ) \"maiden, girl\". The term is used by (human) women to address each other, so Iris addressing Helen, or Eurycleia addressing Penelope as \"dear \"nymph\"\" (\"Il.\" 3.130, \"Od.\" 4.743). Reduced to , the word remains the regular Modern Greek term for \"bride\". In Katharevousa, it is still , as in the refrain of the Marian hymn \"Agni Parthene\" (c. 1880), \"hail, unwedded bride\".\n\nThe Doric and Aeolic (Homeric) form is . The \"Iliad\" (6.420) refers to \"mountain nymphs, maidens of Zeus\":\nThe divine nymphs are called θεαὶ Νύμφαι \"the nubile goddesses\" in \"Il.\" 24.616. In mystical theology, the term is applied to souls seeking re-birth. The derived verb means \"to marry (of a woman)\" (with dative), \"to give in marriage (of the bride's father)\" or \"to marry (of the husband)\" (with accusative).\n\nThe etymology of the noun is not certain. It has been compared to Latin ' \"to wed\", as derived from a word for \"veil, cover\", root cognate with Greek νέφος, Latin \"nubes\" (\"cloud\"), Greek νεφέλη, Latin \"nebula\" (\"mist, vapor\"), and Latin \"nimbus\" (\"cloud cover\"). This is not generally accepted. Beekes argues for a pre-Greek origin of the word. An alternative suggestion connects a word for \"to bud, swell\", from the root of German ') \"bud\". This is informed by a gloss of Hesychius which gives \"rose-bud\" as a meaning of .\n\nThe Greek nymphs were spirits invariably bound to places, not unlike the Latin \"genius loci\", and the difficulty of transferring their cult may be seen in the complicated myth that brought Arethusa to Sicily. In the works of the Greek-educated Latin poets, the nymphs gradually absorbed into their ranks the indigenous Italian divinities of springs and streams (Juturna, Egeria, Carmentis, Fontus), while the Lymphae (originally Lumpae), Italian water-goddesses, owing to the accidental similarity of their names, could be identified with the Greek Nymphae. The mythologies of classicizing Roman poets were unlikely to have affected the rites and cult of individual nymphs venerated by country people in the springs and clefts of Latium. Among the Roman literate class, their sphere of influence was restricted, and they appear almost exclusively as divinities of the watery element.\n\nThe ancient Greek belief in nymphs survived in many parts of the country into the early years of the twentieth century, when they were usually known as \"nereids\". At that time, John Cuthbert Lawson wrote: \"...there is probably no nook or hamlet in all Greece where the womenfolk at least do not scrupulously take precautions against the thefts and malice of the nereids, while many a man may still be found to recount in all good faith stories of their beauty, passion and caprice.\n\n\"Nor is it a matter of faith only; more than once I have been in villages where certain Nereids were known by sight to several persons (so at least they averred); and there was a wonderful agreement among the witnesses in the description of their appearance and dress.\"\n\nNymphs tended to frequent areas distant from humans but could be encountered by lone travelers outside the village, where their music might be heard, and the traveler could spy on their dancing or bathing in a stream or pool, either during the noon heat or in the middle of the night. They might appear in a whirlwind. Such encounters could be dangerous, bringing dumbness, besotted infatuation, madness or stroke to the unfortunate human. When parents believed their child to be nereid-struck, they would pray to Saint Artemidos.\nA motif that entered European art during the Renaissance was the idea of a statue of a nymph sleeping in a grotto or spring. This motif supposedly came from an Italian report of a Roman sculpture of a nymph at a fountain above the River Danube. The report, and an accompanying poem supposedly on the fountain describing the sleeping nymph, are now generally concluded to be a fifteenth-century forgery, but the motif proved influential among artists and landscape gardeners for several centuries after, with copies seen at neoclassical gardens such as the grotto at Stourhead.\n\nDue to the depiction of the mythological nymphs as females who mate with men or women freely and without care, the term is often related to women who are perceived as behaving similarly. (For example, the title of the Perry Mason detective novel \"The Case of the Negligent Nymph\" (1956) by Erle Stanley Gardner is derived from this meaning of the word.)\n\nThe term \"nymphomania\" was created by modern psychology as referring to a \"desire to engage in human sexual behavior at a level high enough to be considered clinically significant\", \"nymphomaniac\" being the person suffering from such a disorder. Due to widespread use of the term among lay persons (often shortened to \"nympho\") and stereotypes attached, professionals nowadays prefer the term \"hypersexuality\", which can refer to males and females alike.\n\nThe word \"nymphet\" is used to identify a sexually precocious girl. The term was made famous in the novel \"Lolita\" by Vladimir Nabokov. The main character, Humbert Humbert, uses the term many times, usually in reference to the title character.\n\nAs H.J. Rose states, all the names for various classes of nymphs are plural feminine adjectives agreeing with the substantive \"nymphai\", and there was no single classification that could be seen as canonical and exhaustive. Thus, the classes of nymphs tend to overlap, which complicates the task of precise classification.\n\nRose mentions dryads and hamadryads as nymphs of trees generally, \"meliai\" as nymphs of ash trees, and naiads as nymphs of water, but no others specifically.\n\nThe following is not the authentic Greek classification, but is intended simply as a guide:\n\nThe following is a list of groups of nymphs associated with this or that particular location.\nNymphs in such groupings could belong to any of the classes mentioned above (Naiades, Oreades, and so on).\n\nThe following is a selection of names of the nymphs whose class was not specified in the source texts.

Rock glaciers may extend outward and downslope from talus cones, glaciers or terminal moraines of glaciers. There are two types of rock glaciers: periglacial glaciers, or talus-derived glaciers, and glacial rock glaciers, such as the Timpanogos Glacier in Utah, which are often found in the former places of glaciers. Possible Martian rock glacier features have been identified by the Mars Orbiter spacecraft. A rock glacier, especially if its origin is unclear, can be considered as a discrete debris accumulation.\n\nThe two known factors that must be present in order to create rock glaciers are low ice velocity and permafrost. Most glacial rock glaciers are created by the recession of debris covered glaciers. Glacial rock glaciers are often found in cirque basins where rocky debris falls off the steep sides and accumulates on ice glaciers. As the glaciers shrink, their composition changes as they become increasingly covered with debris. Eventually, the glacial ice is replaced by ice cored rocks. With the exception of ice-cored rock glaciers, rock glaciers are a periglacial process. This means that they are a nonglacial landform associated with cold climates, particularly with various aspects of frozen ground. Periglacial rock glaciers require permafrost instead of glacial ice in order to form. Instead, they are caused by continuous freezing occurring within a talus lobe.\n\nRock glaciers move downslope by deformation of the ice contained within them, causing their surface to resemble those of glaciers. Some rock glaciers can reach lengths of 3 km and can have terminal embankments of 60 m high. Blocks on the surface can be up to 8 m in diameter. Flow features on the surface of rock glaciers may develop from:\n\nTheir growth and formation is subject to some debate, with three main theories:\n\nRock glaciers may move or \"creep\" at a very slow rate in part dependent on the amount of ice present.\n\nAccording to recent studies, rock glaciers positively influence the streams around them.\n\nSubject to climate variation, rock glaciers in proximity tend to have highly synchronous movement pattern over a short time scale; over long term, however, the relationship between rock glacier velocity and climate difference may not be as pronounced, due to the influences of topographic factors and lack of ice or debris budget within the glacier body.\n\nRock glaciers in the Chilean Andes help supply the water for much of Chile, including the capital of Santiago. Mining operations in the high mountains have led to the degradation and destruction of more than two rock glaciers. Several copper mines dump their waste rock onto rock glaciers, which results in faster melting and higher velocity movement of these rock glaciers. The dumping of waste rock on the rock glaciers may lead to their destabilization. In 2004, protesting irrigation farmers and environmentalists changed rules so new mining projects can no longer damage or alter rock glaciers in Chile.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18967136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18967136", "title": "Seismoelectrical method", "text": "Seismoelectrical method\n\nThe seismoelectrical method (which is different from the electroseismic physical principle) is based on the generation of electromagnetic fields in soils and rocks by seismic waves. This technique is still under development and in the future it may have applications like detecting and characterizing fluids in the underground by their electrical properties, among others, usually related to fluids (porosity, transmissivity, physical properties).\n\nWhen a seismic wave encounters an interface, it creates a charge separation at the interface forming an electric dipole. This dipole radiates an electromagnetic wave that can be detected by antennae on the ground surface.\n\nAs the seismic (P or compression) waves stress earth materials, four geophysical phenomena occur:\n\nThe dominant application of the electroseismic method is to measure the electrokinetic effect or streaming potential (item 2, above). Electrokinetic effects are initiated by sound waves (typically P-waves) passing through a porous rock inducing relative motion of the rock matrix and fluid. Motion of the ionic fluid through the capillaries in the rock occurs with cations (or less commonly, anions) preferentially adhering to the capillary walls, so that applied pressure and resulting fluid flow relative to the rock matrix produces an electric dipole. In a non-homogeneous formation, the seismic wave generates an oscillating flow of fluid and a corresponding oscillating electrical and EM field. The resulting EM wave can be detected by electrode pairs placed on the ground surface.\n\nHowever, P-waves moving through a solid that contains some moisture also generates an electric phenomenon called coseismic waves. The coseismic waves travel with P-waves and are not sensitive to electrical properties of the subsurface. The dipole antenna cannot distinguish electrokinetic signal from coseismic signal so it records them both, and coseismic waves must be removed while processing field data to be able to actually interpret electrokinetic effect \n\nAt the moment, there is not a field routine operation method, but in scientific studies an array of several dipole antennas is placed along a straight line to record seismoelectric waves, and an array of geophones placed between dipole antennas to record seismic wave arrivals. Geophones are necessary to be able to suppress coseismic waves from the seismoelectric signal, so that electrokinetic effect can be separated and studied.\n\nThe electroseismic method is very susceptible to electrical cultural noise, and has also the same noise sources as reflection seismic method, which include ground roll, multiples and random noise. Seismoelectrical method also has a very low signal-to-noise ratio, because the attenuation of electromagnetic waves inside the earth is 1/r^3, thus theoretically limiting its depth of exploration to three hundred meters. Typical electroseismic signals are at the microvolt level. The electroseismic signal is proportional to the pressure of the seismic wave. Thus it is possible to increase the signal by using stronger seismic sources.\n\nThe electrokinetic effect is produced by several kinds of contrasts between layers like porosity contrasts, potential contrasts, viscosity contrasts and saturation in fluids contrasts among others. The possible causes of elektronkinetic effect between layers is still now a matter of study. With nowadays knowledge and technology it's really hard to determine without further data (like borehole or other geophysics data from the location), what are electrokinetic conversions produced by, and further studies will have to be carried out to be able to interpret electrokinetic data correctly. Although that, the electrokinetic effect has a promising future in near-surface and borehole geophysics.\n\nThe propagation of seismic waves in porous rocks is associated with a small transient deformation of rock matrix and pore space which can cause electromagnetic fields of observable amplitude if the pores are saturated. Seismoelectric field measurements are expected to help localize permeable layers in porous rocks and provide information about anelastic properties. This theoretical potential for hydrogeological applications, however, is so far confirmed only by a very limited number of successful field studies. As a consequence, the seismoelectric method is still far from being routinely used.\n\n\n"}

Particles that experience a force, either due to gravity or due to centrifugal motion will tend to move in a uniform manner in the direction exerted by that force. For gravity settling, this means that the particles will tend to fall to the bottom of the vessel, forming a slurry at the vessel base.\n\nSettling is an important operation in many applications, such as mining, wastewater treatment, biological science, space propellant reignition, \nand scooping.\n\nFor settling particles that are considered individually, i.e. dilute particle solutions, there are two main forces enacting upon any particle. The primary force is an applied force, such as gravity, and a drag force that is due to the motion of the particle through the fluid. The applied force is usually not affected by the particle's velocity, whereas the drag force is a function of the particle velocity.\n\nFor a particle at rest no drag force will be exhibited, which causes the particle to accelerate due to the applied force. When the particle accelerates, the drag force acts in the direction opposite to the particle's motion, retarding further acceleration, in the absence of other forces drag directly opposes the applied force. As the particle increases in velocity eventually the drag force and the applied force will approximately equate, causing no further change in the particle's velocity. This velocity is known as the terminal velocity, \"settling velocity\" or \"fall velocity\" of the particle. This is readily measurable by examining the rate of fall of individual particles.\n\nThe terminal velocity of the particle is affected by many parameters, i.e. anything that will alter the particle's drag. Hence the terminal velocity is most notably dependent upon grain size, the shape (roundness and sphericity) and density of the grains, as well as to the viscosity and density of the fluid.\n\nFor dilute suspensions, Stokes' law predicts the settling velocity of small spheres in fluid, either air or water. This originates due to the strength of viscous forces at the surface of the particle providing the majority of the retarding force. Stokes' law finds many applications in the natural sciences, and is given by:\n\nwhere \"w\" is the settling velocity, \"ρ\" is density (the subscripts \"p\" and \"f\" indicate particle and fluid respectively), \"g\" is the acceleration due to gravity, \"r\" is the radius of the particle and \"μ\" is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nStokes' law applies when the Reynolds number, Re, of the particle is less than 0.1. Experimentally Stokes' law is found to hold within 1% for formula_2, within 3% for formula_3 and within 9% formula_4. With increasing Reynolds numbers, Stokes law begins to break down due to the increasing importance of fluid inertia, requiring the use of empirical solutions to calculate drag forces.\n\nDefining a drag coefficient, formula_5, as the ratio of the force experienced by the particle divided by the impact pressure of the fluid, a coefficient that can be considered as the transfer of available fluid force into drag is established. In this region the inertia of the impacting fluid is responsible for the majority of force transfer to the particle.\n\nFor a spherical particle in the Stokes regime this value is not constant, however in the Newtonian drag regime the drag on a sphere can be approximated by a constant, 0.44. This constant value implies that the efficiency of transfer of energy from the fluid to the particle is not a function of fluid velocity.\n\nAs such the terminal velocity of a particle in a Newtonian regime can again be obtained by equating the drag force to the applied force, resulting in the following expression\n\nIn the intermediate region between Stokes drag and Newtonian drag, there exists a transitional regime, where the analytical solution to the problem of a falling sphere becomes problematic. To solve this, empirical expressions are used to calculate drag in this region. One such empirical equation is that of Schiller and Naumann, and may be valid for formula_8:\n\nStokes, transitional and Newtonian settling describe the behaviour of a single spherical particle in an infinite fluid, known as free settling. However this model has limitations in practical application. Alternate considerations, such as the interaction of particles in the fluid, or the interaction of the particles with the container walls can modify the settling behaviour. Settling that has these forces in appreciable magnitude is known as hindered settling. Subsequently semi-analytic or empirical solutions may be used to perform meaningful hindered settling calculations.\n\nThe solid-gas flow systems are present in many industrial applications, as dry, catalytic reactors, settling tanks, pneumatic conveying of solids, among others. Obviously, in industrial operations the drag rule is not simple as a single sphere settling in a stationary fluid. However, this knowledge indicates how drag behaves in more complex systems, which are designed and studied by engineers applying empirical and more sophisticated tools.\n\nFor example, \"Settling tanks\" are used for separating solids and/or oil from another liquid. In food processing, the vegetable is crushed and placed inside of a settling tank with water. The oil floats the top of the water then is collected. In water and waste water treatment a flocculant is often added prior to settling to form larger particles that settle out quickly in a settling tank or an inclined plate settler, leaving the water with a lower turbidity.\n\nIn winemaking, the French term for this process is \"\". This step usually occurs in white wine production before the start of fermentation.\n\nSettleable solids are the particulates that settle out of a still fluid. Settleable solids can be quantified for a suspension using an Imhoff cone. The standard Imhoff cone of transparent glass or plastic holds one liter of liquid and has calibrated markings to measure the volume of solids accumulated in the bottom of the conical container after settling for one hour. A standardized Imhoff cone procedure is commonly used to measure suspended solids in wastewater or stormwater runoff. The simplicity of the method makes it popular for estimating water quality.\n\nThe water sample to be measured should be representative of the total stream. Samples are best collected from the discharge falling from a pipe or over a weir, because samples skimmed from the top of a flowing channel may fail to capture larger, high-density solids moving along the bottom of the channel. The sampling bucket is vigorously stirred to uniformly re-suspend all collected solids immediately before pouring the volume required to fill the cone. The filled cone is immediately placed in a stationary holding rack to allow quiescent settling. The rack should be located away from heating sources, including direct sunlight, which might cause currents within the cone from thermal density changes of the liquid contents. After 45 minutes of settling, the cone is partially rotated about its axis of symmetry just enough to dislodge any settled material adhering to the side of the cone. Accumulated sediment is observed and measured fifteen minutes later, after one hour of total settling time.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "217296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=217296", "title": "Shadow", "text": "Shadow\n\nA shadow is a dark area where light from a light source is blocked by an opaque object. It occupies all of the three-dimensional volume behind an object with light in front of it. The cross section of a shadow is a two-dimensional silhouette, or a reverse projection of the object blocking the light.\n\nA point source of light casts only a simple shadow, called an \"umbra\". For a non-point or \"extended\" source of light, the shadow is divided into the umbra, penumbra and antumbra. The wider the light source, the more blurred the shadow becomes. If two penumbras overlap, the shadows appear to attract and merge. This is known as the Shadow blister effect.\n\nThe outlines of the shadow zones can be found by tracing the rays of light emitted by the outermost regions of the extended light source. The umbra region does not receive any direct light from any part of the light source, and is the darkest. A viewer located in the umbra region cannot directly see any part of the light source.\n\nBy contrast, the penumbra is illuminated by some parts of the light source, giving it an intermediate level of light intensity. A viewer located in the penumbra region will see the light source, but it is partially blocked by the object casting the shadow.\n\nIf there is more than one light source, there will be several shadows, with the overlapping parts darker, and various combinations of brightnesses or even colors. The more diffuse the lighting is, the softer and more indistinct the shadow outlines become, until they disappear. The lighting of an overcast sky produces few visible shadows.\n\nThe absence of diffusing atmospheric effects in the vacuum of outer space produces shadows that are stark and sharply delineated by high-contrast boundaries between light and dark.\n\nFor a person or object touching the surface where the shadow is projected (e.g. a person standing on the ground, or a pole in the ground) the shadows converge at the point of contact.\n\nA shadow shows, apart from distortion, the same image as the silhouette when looking at the object from the sun-side, hence the mirror image of the silhouette seen from the other side.\n\nThe names umbra, penumbra and antumbra are often used for the shadows cast by astronomical objects, though they are sometimes used to describe levels of darkness, such as in sunspots. An astronomical object casts human-visible shadows when its apparent magnitude is equal or lower than -4. Currently the only astronomical objects able to produce visible shadows on Earth are the sun, the moon and, in the right conditions, Venus or Jupiter.\n\nA shadow cast by the Earth on the Moon is a lunar eclipse. Conversely, a shadow cast by the Moon on the Earth is a solar eclipse.\n\nThe sun casts shadows which change dramatically through the day. The length of a shadow cast on the ground is proportional to the cotangent of the sun's elevation angle—its angle \"θ\" relative to the horizon. Near sunrise and sunset, when \"θ\" = 0° and \"cot(θ)\" = ∞, shadows can be extremely long. If the sun passes directly overhead, then \"θ\" = 90°, \"cot(θ)\" = 0, and shadows are cast directly underneath objects.\n\nSuch variations have long aided travellers during their travels, especially in barren regions such as the Arabian Desert.\n\nThe farther the distance from the object blocking the light to the surface of projection, the larger the silhouette (they are considered proportional). Also, if the object is moving, the shadow cast by the object will project an image with dimensions (length) expanding proportionally faster than the object's own rate of movement. The increase of size and movement is also true if the distance between the object of interference and the light source are closer. This, however, does not mean the shadow may move faster than light, even when projected at vast distances, such as light years. The loss of light, which projects the shadow, will move towards the surface of projection at light speed.\n\nAlthough the edge of a shadow appears to \"move\" along a wall, in actuality the increase of a shadow's length is part of a new projection which propagates at the speed of light from the object of interference. Since there is no actual communication between points in a shadow (except for reflection or interference of light, at the speed of light), a shadow that projects over a surface of large distances (light years) cannot convey information between those distances with the shadow's edge.\n\nVisual artists are usually very aware of colored light emitted or reflected from several sources, which can generate complex multicolored shadows. Chiaroscuro, sfumato, and silhouette are examples of artistic techniques which make deliberate use of shadow effects.\n\nDuring the daytime, a shadow cast by an opaque object illuminated by sunlight has a bluish tinge. This happens because of Rayleigh scattering, the same property that causes the sky to appear blue. The opaque object is able to block the light of the sun, but not the ambient light of the sky which is blue as the atmosphere molecules scatter blue light more effectively. As a result, the shadow appears bluish.\n\nA shadow occupies a three-dimensional volume of space, but this is usually not visible until it projects onto a reflective surface. A light fog, mist, or dust cloud can reveal the 3D presence of volumetric patterns in light and shadow.\n\nFog shadows may look odd to viewers who are not used to seeing shadows in three dimensions. A thin fog is just dense enough to be illuminated by the light that passes through the gaps in a structure or in a tree. As a result, the path of an object's shadow through the fog becomes visible as a darkened volume. In a sense, these shadow lanes are the inverse of crepuscular rays caused by beams of light, but caused by the shadows of solid objects.\n\nTheatrical fog and strong beams of light are sometimes used by lighting designers and visual artists who seek to highlight three-dimensional aspects of their work. \n\nOftentimes shadows of chain-linked fences and other such objects become inverted (light and dark areas are swapped) as they get farther from the object. A chain-link fence shadow will start with light diamonds and shadow outlines when it is touching the fence, but it will gradually blur. Eventually, if the fence is tall enough, the light pattern will go to shadow diamonds and light outlines.\n\nIn photography, which is essentially recording patterns of light, shade, and color, \"highlights\" and \"shadows\" are the brightest and darkest parts, respectively, of a scene or image. Photographic exposure must be adjusted (unless special effects are wanted) to allow the film or sensor, which has limited dynamic range, to record detail in the highlights without them being washed out, and in the shadows without their becoming undifferentiated black areas.\n\nOn satellite imagery and aerial photographs, taken vertically, tall buildings can be recognized as such by their long shadows (if the photographs are not taken in the tropics around noon), while these also show more of the shape of these buildings.\n\n\"Shadow\" as a term is often used for any occlusion or blockage, not just those with respect to light. For example, a rain shadow is a dry area, which with respect to the prevailing wind direction, is beyond a mountain range; the elevated terrain impedes rainclouds from entering the dry zone. An acoustic shadow occurs when direct sound has been blocked or diverted around a given area.\n\nAn unattended shade was thought by some cultures to be similar to that of a ghost. The name for the fear of shadows is \"sciophobia\" or \"sciaphobia\".\n\nChhaya is the Hindu goddess of shadows.\n\nIn heraldry, when a charge is supposedly shown \"in shadow\" (the appearance is of the charge merely being outlined in a neutral tint rather than being of one or more tinctures different from the field on which it is placed), it is technnically described as \"umbrated\". Supposedly, only a limited number of specific charges can be so depicted.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7118632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7118632", "title": "Tehcir Law", "text": "Tehcir Law\n\nThe Tehcir Law (from \"tehcir\", a word of Arabic origin in Ottoman Turkish and meaning \"deportation\" or \"forced displacement\" as defined by the Turkish Language Institute), or, officially by the Republic of Turkey, the \"Sevk ve İskân Kanunu\" (Relocation and Resettlement Law) was a law passed by the Ottoman Parliament on May 27, 1915 authorizing the deportation of the Ottoman Empire's Armenian population. The resettlement campaign resulted in the deaths of anywhere between 800,000 and over 1,800,000 civilians in what is commonly referred to as the Armenian Genocide. The bill was officially enacted on June 1, 1915 and expired on February 8, 1916.\n\nThe Tehcir Law was part of the \"special measures\" (declared in a euphemistic language) against the Armenian population taken by the Ottoman Empire during World War I. This was coupled with a second set of orders given to the \"Special Organization\" for systematic elimination of the evacuated population during the death marches, also including the alleged taking care of the vacated properties.\n\nThe Ottoman archives document that the Armenian deportations started as early as March 2, 1915.\n\nAfter the expiration of the Tehcir Law, deportations and massacres still occurred. On September 13, 1915, the Ottoman parliament passed the \"Temporary Law of Expropriation and Confiscation,\" stating that all property, including land, livestock, and homes belonging to Armenians, was to be confiscated by the Ottoman authorities.\n\nBefore the Ottoman parliament implemented the \"Tehcir Law\", there was a circular by Talaat Pasha. In the night of April 24, 1915, Mehmed Talaat Bey, who was the minister of interior at the time, ordered 250 Armenian intellectuals to be deported from Constantinople.\n\nIn May 1915, Mehmed Talaat Pasha requested that the Ottoman Cabinet and the then Grand Vizier Said Halim Pasha legalize a measure for relocation and settlement of the Armenians to other places. Talaat's words were \"the Armenian riots and massacres, which had arisen in a number of places in the country are a threat to national security.\"\n\nTehcir Law was officially a \"temporary\" law that expired on February 8, 1916. It was a civil law, planned, implemented and enforced with an office (created by the law) to coordinate the activities under the name of \"Migrant General Directorate\" (Ottoman Turkish: Muhacirin Müdüriyet-i Umumîyesi). The civil law gave the military an enforcing power only if there were parties opposing the implementation. The rules and regulations of the law, as published in the \"Takvim-i Vekayi\" (Ottoman official newspaper), were public and they were shared with all the political parties.\n\nThe Tehcir Law was allegedly about \n\nOne Ottoman Archival material, dated from July 12, 1915 suggests that massacres were part of those measures implemented against the Armenians. The Turkish Martial Court supports this by referring to documents that claim that the main reason for the evacuation was annihilation.\n\nAlthough this law was directed against one particular ethnic group (the Armenians), the Assyrian population of the Ottoman Empire also fell victim as did some other Christians from the East.\n\nIn the text of the law, there is no explicit mention of the Armenian Question, and the text contains that: (1) the ill, (2) the blind, (3) Catholics, (4) Protestants, (5) the soldiers and their families, (6) the officers, (7) merchants, some workers and masters were not subject to evacuation. If conditions got worse, these groups are ordered to be settled in the city centers.<ref name=\"Coding Office, no 56/27; no 67/186\">Coding Office, no 56/27; no 67/186</ref>\n\nCapitulations of the Ottoman Empire granted missionaries a protectorate state (see:Protectorate of missions). There is a group of rules that grant rights to missionaries under the Ottoman Empire. Another decipher orders the Catholic Armenian missionaries not to leave the Ottoman Empire until the next order. This message was not respected in some centers, such as Maraş and Konya.\n\nThe alleged intention of the law, which was published during World War I, was a \"temporary movement of the Ottoman citizens\" during the conflicts and not the permanent displacement as there was a decree (regulation, or adjunct) with respect to the relocated citizens by the \"Tehcir Law\" who wanted to return; it claimed \"except those people [affected by the Tehcir Law], no one else will be touched.\" Also if we look at the fourth section of the Tehcir law, it was specifically designed to hold the enforcer units responsible to follow up and record the properties owned by the subjects of the immigration. The law included a responsible party for the protection of properties the owners could/will return in a later term. Another law was passed to regulate the enforcement of this section On 10 June 1915. In this section, it was demanded that there would be three copies of this information; one kept in the regional churches, one in the regional administration, and one kept by the commission responsible for the execution of the law. The second and third parties of this law were held responsible for the protection of the properties until the immigrants' return.\n\nWhile on the surface the law was allegedly temporary, the main reason of the law was to settle the Armenian Question once for all, therefore permanently. Kamuran Gurun has released archival material from the minister of war that provides the aim of passing the law. In that letter Enver takes it as permanent and not temporary with the aim of fixing the Armenian \"problem\" once and for all.\n\nWhile it is claimed that the debts of the evacuated population were to be completely canceled, and recurring tax debts (property tax) of the Armenians were to be postponed until their supposed return, the Armenian properties were seized by the government, sold or given to the Muslim residents or immigrants. A significant amount of money made from the sale of the seized properties was transferred and secured in Berlin.\n\nA fund was initiated with the law. The control of the fund was assigned to director Şükrü Bey, a directorate under the immigrants general office (Immigrant and Tribe Settling). He was accused of complicity during the courts-martial in the destruction of the Armenian population. Also considered to maintain the link between the Ittihadists and the Special Organization. From the documents:\nAlso, the Ottoman government under the international agreements assigned within the capitulations, enabled fund transfers using the missionaries and consuls. Armenian immigrants from the United States sent funds, which were distributed to the Armenians under the knowledge of the government by these institutions. The \"American Near East Relief Committee\", a relief organization for refugees in the Middle East, helped donate over $102 million to Armenians both during and after the war.\n\nIt has to be noted that the funds within the provinces aided the immigrants, whose money allocations were sent under provincial budgets depending on the condition of needs.\n\nThose are contradicted by the Ottoman barring access to its own allies relief to the starving Armenian population.\n\nThe law was repealed on February 21, 1916, with an order sent to all Ottoman provinces, while the destruction of the Armenian population continued. Claimed political detainees continued to be displaced to the Der Zor province. All the activities finalized on March 15, 1916.\n"}
{"id": "2843273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2843273", "title": "Vegetarianism and religion", "text": "Vegetarianism and religion\n\nVegetarianism is strongly linked with a number of religions that originated in ancient India (Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism). In Jainism, vegetarianism is mandatory for everyone; in Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism, it is advocated by some influential scriptures and religious authorities. Comparatively, in the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), the Bahá'í Faith and Dharmic religions such as Sikhism, vegetarianism is less commonly viewed as a religious obligation, although in all these faiths there are groups actively promoting vegetarianism on religious grounds.\n\nMost Indian religions have philosophical schools that forbid consumption of meat and Jainism institutes an outright ban on the same. Consequently, India is home to more vegetarians than any other country. About 30% of India's 1.2 billion population practices lacto vegetarianism, with overall meat consumption increasing. The per capita meat consumption in India in 2002 was 5.2 kg, while it was 24 times more in the United States at 124.8 kg. Meat consumption in the United States and India grew at about 40% over the last 50 years. In 1961 Indian per capita meat consumption was 3.7 kg, while the US consumption was 89.2 kg.\n\nVegetarianism in Jainism is based on the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa, literally \"non-injuring\"). Vegetarianism is considered mandatory for everyone. Jains are either lacto-vegetarians or vegans. No use or consumption of products obtained from dead animals is allowed. Moreover, Jains try to avoid unnecessary injury to plants and \"suksma jiva\" (Sanskrit for \"subtle life forms\"; minuscule organisms). The goal is to cause as little violence to living things as possible, hence they avoid eating roots, tubers such as potatoes, garlic and anything that involves uprooting (and thus eventually killing) a plant to obtain food.\n\nEvery act by which a person directly or indirectly supports killing or injury is seen as violence (\"hinsa\"), which creates harmful karma. The aim of ahimsa is to prevent the accumulation of such karma. Jains consider nonviolence to be the most essential religious duty for everyone (ahinsā paramo dharmaḥ, a statement often inscribed on Jain temples). Their scrupulous and thorough way of applying nonviolence to everyday activities, and especially to food, shapes their entire lives and is the most significant hallmark of Jain identity. A side effect of this strict discipline is the exercise of asceticism, which is strongly encouraged in Jainism for lay people as well as for monks and nuns.\n\nJains do not practice animal sacrifice as they consider all sentient beings to be equal.\n\nVegetarianism is an integral part of most schools of Hinduism although there are a wide variety of practices and beliefs that have changed over time. An estimated 30% of all Hindus are vegetarians. Some sects of Hindus do not observe vegetarianism.\n\nThe principle of nonviolence (Ahimsa) applied to animals is connected with the intention to avoid negative karmic influences which result from violence. The suffering of all beings is believed to arise from craving and desire, conditioned by the karmic effects of both animal and human action. The violence of slaughtering animals for food, and its source in craving, reveal flesh eating as one mode in which humans enslave themselves to suffering. Hinduism holds that such influences affect the person who permits the slaughter of an animal, the person who kills it, the person who cuts it up, the person who buys or sells meat, the person who cooks it, the person who serves it up, and the person who eats it. They must all be considered the slayers of the animal. The question of religious duties towards the animals and of negative Karma incurred from violence (\"himsa\") against them is discussed in detail in Hindu scriptures and religious law books.\n\nHindu scriptures belong or refer to the Vedic period which lasted till about 500 BCE according to the chronological division by modern historians. In the historical Vedic religion, the predecessor of Hinduism, meat eating was not banned in principle, but was restricted by specific rules. Several highly authoritative scriptures bar violence against domestic animals except in the case of ritual sacrifice. This view is clearly expressed in the Mahabharata (3.199.11-12; 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17), the Bhagavata Purana (11.5.13-14), and the Chandogya Upanishad (8.15.1). For instance, many Hindus point to the Mahabharata's maxim that \"Nonviolence is the highest duty and the highest teaching,\" as advocating a vegetarian diet. The Mahabharata also states that adharma (sin) was born when creatures started to devour one another from want of food and that adharma always destroys every creature \" It is also reflected in the Manu Smriti (5.27-44), a particularly renowned traditional Hindu law book (Dharmaśāstra). These texts strongly condemn the slaughter of animals and meat eating.\n\nThe Mahabharata (12.260; 13.115-116; 14.28) and the Manu Smriti (5.27-55) contain lengthy discussions about the legitimacy of ritual slaughter and subsequent consumption of the meat. In the Mahabharata both meat eaters and vegetarians present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Apart from the debates about domestic animals, there is also a long discourse by a hunter in defence of hunting and meat eating. These texts show that both ritual slaughter and hunting were challenged by advocates of universal non-violence and their acceptability was doubtful and a matter of dispute.\n\nIn modern India the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community or caste and according to regional traditions. Hindu vegetarians usually eschew eggs but consume milk and dairy products, so they are lacto-vegetarians.\n\nAccording to a survey of 2006, vegetarianism is weak in coastal states and strong in landlocked northern and western states and among Brahmins in general, 55 percent of whom are vegetarians. In 2018, a study from \"Economic and Political Weekly\" shows that in facts only a third of the upper-caste Indians could be vegetarian.\n\nMany coastal inhabitants are fish eaters. In particular Bengali Hindus have romanticized fishermen and the consumption of fish through poetry, literature and music.\n\nHindus who eat meat are encouraged to eat Jhatka meat.\n\nAnimal sacrifice in Hinduism (sometimes known as Jhatka Bali) is the ritual killing of an animal in Hinduism.\n\nThe ritual sacrifice normally forms part of a festival to honour a Hindu god. For example, in Nepal the Hindu goddess Gadhimai, is honoured every 5 years with the slaughter of 250,000 animals. Bali sacrifice today is common at the Sakta shrines of the Goddess Kali.\n\nThe First Precept prohibits Buddhists from killing people or animals. The matter of whether this forbids Buddhists from eating meat has long been a matter of debate.\n\nThe first Buddhist monks and nuns were forbidden from growing, storing, or cooking their own food. They relied entirely on the generosity of alms to feed themselves, and were not allowed to accept money to buy their own food. They could not make special dietary requests, and had to accept whatever food alms givers had available, including meat. Monks and nuns of the Theravada school of Buddhism, which predominates in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, Burma, and Laos, still follow these strictures today.\n\nThese strictures were relaxed in China, Korea, Japan, and other countries that follow Mahayana Buddhism, where monasteries were in remote mountain areas and the distance to the nearest towns made daily alms rounds impractical. There, Buddhist monks and nuns could cultivate their own crops, store their own harvests, cook their own meals, and accept money to buy anything else they needed in terms of food in the market.\n\nAccording to the Vinaya Pitaka, when Devadatta urged him to make complete abstinence from meat compulsory, the Buddha refused, maintaining that \"monks would have to accept whatever they found in their begging bowls, including meat, provided that they had not seen, had not heard, and had no reason to suspect that the animal had been killed so that the meat could be given to them\". There were prohibitions on specific kinds of meat: meat from humans, meat from royal animals such as elephants or horses, meat from dogs, and meat from dangerous animals like snakes, lions, tigers, panthers, bears and hyenas.\n\nOn the other hand, certain Mahayana sutras strongly denounce the eating of meat. According to the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the Buddha revoked this permission to eat meat and warned of a dark age when false monks would claim that they were allowed meat. In the Lankavatara Sutra, a disciple of the Buddha named Mahamati asks \"[Y]ou teach a doctrine that is flavoured with compassion. It is the teaching of the perfect Buddhas. And yet we eat meat nonetheless; we have not put an end to it.\" An entire chapter is devoted to the Buddha's response, wherein he lists a litany of spiritual, physical, mental, and emotional reasons why meat eating should be abjured. However, according to , this chapter on meat eating is a \"later addition to the text...It is quite likely that meat-eating was practiced more or less among the earlier Buddhists, which was made a subject of severe criticism by their opponents. The Buddhists at the time of the \"Laṅkāvatāra\" did not like it, hence this addition in which an apologetic tone is noticeable.\" points to a passage in the Surangama Sutra which implies advocacy of \"not just a vegetarian, but a vegan lifestyle\"; however, numerous scholars over the centuries have concluded that the Śūraṅgama Sūtra is a forgery. Moreover, in the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the same sutra which records his retraction of permission to eat meat, the Buddha explicitly identifies as \"beautiful foods\" honey, milk, and cream, all of which are eschewed by vegans.\n\nIn the modern Buddhist world, attitudes toward vegetarianism vary by location. In China and Vietnam, monks typically eat no meat, with other restrictions as well. In Japan or Korea some schools do not eat meat, while most do. Theravadins in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia do not practice vegetarianism. All Buddhists however, including monks, are allowed to practice vegetarianism if they wish to do so. states that \"There are no accurate statistics, but I would guess—and it is only a guess—that worldwide about half of all Buddhists are vegetarian\".\n\nFollowers of Sikhism do not have a preference for meat or vegetarian consumption. There are two views on initiated or \"Amritdhari Sikhs\" and meat consumption. \"Amritdhari\" Sikhs (i.e. those that follow the Sikh Rehat Maryada - the Official Sikh Code of Conduct) can eat meat (provided it is not Kutha meat).\"Amritdharis\" that belong to some Sikh sects (e.g. Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Damdami Taksal, Namdhari, Rarionwalay, etc.) are vehemently against the consumption of meat and eggs.\n\nIn the case of meat, the Sikh Gurus have indicated their preference for a simple diet, which could include meat or be vegetarian. Passages from the Guru Granth Sahib (the holy book of Sikhs, also known as the Adi Granth) say that fools argue over this issue. Guru Nanak said that overconsumption of food (Lobh, Greed) involves a drain on the Earth's resources and thus on life. The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, prohibited the Sikhs from the consumption of halal or Kutha (any ritually slaughtered meat) meat because of the Sikh belief that sacrificing an animal in the name of God is mere ritualism (something to be avoided).\n\nOn the views that eating vegetation would be eating flesh, first Sikh Guru Nanak states:\n\nOn Vegetation, the Guru described it as living and experiencing pain:\n\nPage 143 of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji\n\nSikhs who eat meat, eat Jhatka meat.\n\nJudaic, Christian, and Muslim traditions (Abrahamic religions) all have strong connections to the Biblical ideal of the Garden of Eden, which includes references to a herbivore diet. However, only minorities within those populations actually practice and advocate such diets.\n\nMedieval rabbis such as Joseph Albo and Isaac Arama regarded vegetarianism as a moral ideal, and a number of modern Jewish groups and Jewish religious and cultural authorities have promoted vegetarianism. \nGroups advocating for Jewish vegetarianism include Jewish Veg, a contemporary grassroots organization promoting veganism as \"God's ideal diet\", and the Shamayim V'Aretz Institute, which promotes a vegan diet in the Jewish community through animal welfare activism, kosher veganism, and Jewish spirituality. One source of advocacy for Jewish vegetarianism in Israel is Amirim, a vegetarian moshav (village).\n\nJewish Veg has named 75 contemporary rabbis who encourage veganism for all Jews, including Jonathan Wittenberg, Daniel Sperber, David Wolpe, Nathan Lopes Cardozo, Kerry Olitzky, Shmuly Yanklowitz, Aryeh Cohen, Geoffrey Claussen, Rami M. Shapiro, David Rosen, Raysh Weiss, Elyse Goldstein, Shefa Gold, and Yonassan Gershom. Other rabbis who have promoted vegetarianism have included David Cohen, Shlomo Goren, Irving Greenberg, Asa Keisar, Jonathan Sacks, She'ar Yashuv Cohen, and Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog. Herzog has said:\n\nOther notable advocates of Jewish vegetarianism include Franz Kafka, Roberta Kalechofsky, Richard H. Schwartz, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Aaron S. Gross.\n\nJewish vegetarians often cite Jewish principles regarding animal welfare, environmental ethics, moral character, and health as reasons for adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet. Some Jews point to legal principles including Bal tashkhit (the law which prohibits waste) and Tza'ar ba'alei hayyim (the injunction not to cause ‘pain to living creatures’). Many Jewish vegetarians are particularly concerned about cruel practices in factory farms and high-speed, mechanized slaughterhouses. Jonathan Safran Foer has raised these concerns in the short documentary film \"If This Is Kosher...\", responding to what he considers abuses within the kosher meat industry.\n\nSome Jewish vegetarians have argued for vegetarianism on the grounds that Adam and Eve were not allowed to eat meat. states \"And God said: Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree that has seed-yielding fruit—to you it shall be for food.\" According to some classical Jewish Bible commentators this means that God's original plan was for mankind to be vegan, and that God only later gave permission for man to eat meat because of man's weak nature.· \n\nAccording to some opinions, the whole world will be vegetarian in the Messianic era, and not eating meat brings the world closer to that ideal. As the ideal images of the Torah are vegetarian, one may see the laws of kashrut as actually designed to wean Jews away from meat eating and to move them toward the vegetarian ideal. For example, the rituals of kashrut may be seen as reminding Jews of the magnitude of what we do each time we kill a living being. \n\nWhile rabbinic Judaism has generally discouraged ascetic practices, Jewish vegetarians often point out that ethical vegetarianism is not an ascetic practice, as vegetarians do not desire to eat meat. Rabbi Arthur Green has described Jewish vegetarianism as not an ascetic practice but \"a life-affirming one,\" as \"a vegetarian Judaism would be more whole in its ability to embrace the presence of God in all of Creation.\"\n\nSeveral Christian monastic groups, including the Desert Fathers, Trappists, Benedictines, Cistercians and Carthusians, all of the Orthodox monks and also Christian esoteric groups, such as the Rosicrucian Fellowship, have encouraged vegetarianism.\n\nThe Bible Christian Church, a Christian vegetarian sect founded by Reverend William Cowherd in 1809, were one of the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society. Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of temperance.\n\nSome Christian groups, such as Seventh-day Adventists, the Christian Vegetarian Association and Christian anarchists, take a literal interpretation of the Biblical prophecies of universal veg(etari)anism and encourage veg(etari)anism as preferred lifestyles or as a tool to reject the commodity status of animals and the use of animal products for any purpose, although some of them say it is not required. Other groups point instead to allegedly explicit prophecies of temple sacrifices in the Messianic Kingdom, e.g. , where so-called peace offerings and so-called freewill offerings are said that will be offered, and where it states that such offerings are eaten, what may contradict the very purpose of Jesus' purportedly sufficient atonement.\n\nSome Christian vegetarians, such as Keith Akers, argue that Jesus himself was a vegetarian. Akers argues that Jesus was influenced by the Essenes, an ascetic Jewish sect. The present academic consensus is that Jesus was not an Essene. There is no historical record of Jesus’ precise attitudes to animals, but there is a strand in his ethical teaching about the primacy of mercy to the weak, the powerless and the oppressed, which Walters and Portmess argue can also refer to captive animals.\n\nWithin Eastern Christianity, Vegetarianism is practiced as part of fasting during the Great Lent (although shellfish and other non-vertebrate products are generally considered acceptable during some periods of this time); vegan fasting is particularly common in Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodox Churches, such as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which generally fasts 210 days out of the year.\n\nIslam explicitly prohibits eating of some kinds of meat, especially pork. However, one of the most important Islamic celebrations, \"Eid ul-Adha\", involves animal sacrifices. Muslims who can afford to do so sacrifice a domestic animals (usually sheep, but also camels, cows, and goats). According to the Quran, a large portion of the meat has to be given towards the poor and hungry, and every effort is to be made to see that no impoverished Muslim is left without sacrificial food during days of feast like Eid-ul-Adha. Certain Islamic orders are mainly vegetarian; many Sufis maintain a vegetarian diet.\n\nRastafarians generally follow a diet called \"I-tal\", which eschews the eating of food that has been artificially preserved, flavoured, or chemically altered in any way. Some Rastafarians consider it to also forbid the eating of meat but the majority will not eat pork at the very least, considering it unclean.\n\nWhile there are no dietary restrictions in the Bahá'í Faith, `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, noted that a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits and grains was desirable, except for people with a weak constitution or those that are sick. He stated that there are no requirements that Bahá'ís become vegetarian, but that a future society would gradually become vegetarian. `Abdu'l-Bahá also stated that killing animals was somewhat contrary to compassion. While Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that a purely vegetarian diet would be preferable since it avoided killing animals, both he and the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the Bahá'ís have stated that these teachings do not constitute a Bahá'í practice and that Bahá'ís can choose to eat whatever they wish, but to be respectful of others beliefs.\n\nManichaeism was a religion established by the Iranian named Mani during Sassanian empire. The religion prohibited slaughtering or eating animals .\n\nMazdakism, a sect of Zoroastrianism, explicitly promoted vegetarianism. The sect was founded by Mazdak.\n\nOne of the main precepts in Zoroastrianism is respect and kindness towards all living things and condemnation of cruelty against animals\n\nThe Shahnameh states that the evil king of Iran, Zohak was first taught eating meat by the evil one who came to him in the guise of a cook. This was the start of an age of great evil for Iran. Prior to this, in the Golden age of mankind in the days of the great Aryan Kings, man did not eat meat.\n\nThe Pahlavi scriptures state that in the final stages of the world, when the final Saviour Saoshyant arrives, man will become more spiritual and gradually give up meat eating.\n\nVegetarianism is stated to be the future state of the world in Pahlavi scriptures - Atrupat-e Emetan in Iran in Denkard Book VI requested all Zoroastrians to be vegetarians:\n\n\"ku.san enez a-on ku urwar xwarishn bawed shmah mardoman ku derziwishn bawed, ud az tan i gospand pahrezed, ce amar was, eg Ohrmaz i xwaday hay.yarih i gospand ray urwar was dad.\"\n\nMeaning: They hold this also: Be plant eaters (urwar xwarishn) (i.e. vegetarian), O you, men, so that you may live long. Keep away from the body of cattle (tan i gospand), and deeply reckon that Ohrmazd, the Lord has created plants in great number for helping cattle (and men).\"\n\nThe Nation of Islam promotes vegetarianism deeming it the \"most healthful and virtuous way to eat\".\n\nIn Chinese societies, \"simple eating\" (素食 Mandarin: sù shí) refers to a particular restricted diet associated with Taoist monks, and sometimes practiced by members of the general population during Taoist festivals and fasting days. It is similar to Chinese Buddhist vegetarianism. Varying levels of abstinence among Taoists and Taoist-influenced people include veganism, veganism without root vegetables, lacto-ovo vegetarianism, and pescetarianism. Taoist vegetarians also tend to abstain from alcohol and pungent vegetables such as garlic and onions during lenten days. Non-vegetarian Taoists sometimes abstain from beef and water buffalo meat for many cultural reasons.\n\nVegetarianism in the Taoist tradition is similar to that of Lent in the Christian tradition. While highly religious people such as monks may be vegetarian, vegan or pescetarian on a permanent basis, lay practitioners often eat vegetarian on the 1st (new moon), 8th, 14th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 28th, 29th and 30th days of the lunar calendar. In accordance with their Buddhist peers, and because many people are both Taoist and Buddhist, they often also eat lenten on the 15th day (full moon). Taoist vegetarianism is similar to Chinese Buddhist vegetarianism, however, its roots reach to pre-Buddhist times. Believers historically abstained from animal products and alcohol before practicing Confucian, Taoist and Chinese folk religion rites.\n\nIt is referred to by the English word \"vegetarian\"; however, though it rejects meat, eggs, and milk, this diet may include oysters and oyster products or otherwise be pescetarian for some believers. Many lay Taoists who follow modern sects such as that of Yi Guan Dao or Master Ching Hai are vegan or strictly vegetarian. \n\nOahspe (Meaning Sky, Earth and Spirit) is the doctrinal book of those who follow Faithism. The precepts for behavior can be found throughout the book which include\" a herbivorous diet (vegan, vegetable food only), peaceful living (no warring or violence; pacifism), living a life of virtue, service to others, angelic assistance, spiritual communion, and communal living when it is feasible to do so. Freedom and responsibility are two themes reiterated throughout the text of Oahspe.\n\nThere is no set teaching on vegetarianism within the diverse neopagan communities, however many do follow a vegetarian diet often connected to ecological concerns as well as the welfare and rights of animals. Vegetarian practitioners of Wicca will often see their standpoint as a natural extension of the Wiccan Rede. Organizations like SERV refer to the historic figures of Porphyry, Pythagoras and Iamblichus as sources for the Pagan view of vegetarianism. During the 1970s the publication Earth Religion News, focused on articles related to neopaganism and vegetarianism, it was edited by the author Herman Slater.\n\nThe spiritual teacher Meher Baba recommended a vegetarian diet for his followers because he held that it helps one to avoid certain impurities: \"Killing an animal for sport, pleasure or food means catching all its bad impressions, since the motive is selfish...Impressions are contagious. Eating meat is prohibited in many spiritual disciplines because therein the person catches the impressions of the animal, thus rendering himself more susceptible to lust and anger.\"\n\nThe Creativity religion promotes a form of raw veganism in its \"Salubrious Living\" doctrine named after the third text of the faith written by Ben Klassen, which encourages the consumption of only raw foods in their \"natural state, basically fruits, vegetables, grains and nuts,\" getting plenty of physical exercise as well as abstinence from alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, sugar, preservatives, insecticides, narcotics and other drugs whether prescription or non-prescription. Salubrious Living is considered mandatory to \"fully practice\" Creativity and a lawsuit is currently in place against the Bureau of Prisons to get it recognized as a religious dietary preference for incarcerated adherents of the religious movement.\n\n\n"}
